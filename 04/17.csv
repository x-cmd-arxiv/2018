operations routinely available within current quantum technologies. In
particular, the set of free operations is convex and includes quadratic
transformations and conditional coarse-grained measurements. The present theory
lends itself to quantify both quantum non-Gaussianity and Wigner negativity as
resources, depending on the choice of the free-state set --- i.e., the convex
hull of Gaussian states or the states with positive Wigner function,
respectively. After showing that the theory admits no maximally resourceful
state, we define a computable resource monotone --- the Wigner logarithmic
negativity. We use the latter to assess the resource content of experimentally
relevant states --- e.g., photon-added, photon-subtracted, cubic-phase, and cat
states --- and to find optimal working points of some resource concentration
protocols. We envisage applications of this framework to sub-universal and
universal quantum information processing over continuous variables.

different contrast properties depending on the acquisition protocol and the
magnetic properties of tissues. Many MR brain image processing techniques, such
as tissue segmentation, require multiple MR contrasts as inputs, and each
contrast is treated differently. Thus it is advantageous to automate the
identification of image contrasts for various purposes, such as facilitating
image processing pipelines, and managing and maintaining large databases via
content-based image retrieval (CBIR). Most automated CBIR techniques focus on a
two-step process: extracting features from data and classifying the image based
on these features. We present a novel 3D deep convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based method for MR image contrast classification. The proposed CNN
automatically identifies the MR contrast of an input brain image volume.
Specifically, we explored three classification problems: (1) identify
T1-weighted (T1-w), T2-weighted (T2-w), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery
(FLAIR) contrasts, (2) identify pre vs post-contrast T1, (3) identify pre vs
post-contrast FLAIR. A total of 3418 image volumes acquired from multiple sites
and multiple scanners were used. To evaluate each task, the proposed model was
trained on 2137 images and tested on the remaining 1281 images. Results showed
that image volumes were correctly classified with 97.57% accuracy.

extracted from the anode pads by capacitive coupling and read-out by analog
front-end electronics based on the APV25 chip. The new COMPASS RICH-1 photon

into discrete linguistically meaningful units, such as phonemes, while
simultaneously causing a listener to activate words that are similar to the
spoken utterance and to each other. The Neighborhood Activation Model
(NAM~\cite{Luce:1986,Luce:1998}) posits that phonological neighbors (two forms
[words] that differ by one phoneme) compete significantly for recognition as a
spoken word is heard. This definition of phonological similarity can be
extended to an entire corpus of forms to produce a phonological neighbor
network~\cite{Vitevitch:2008} (PNN). We study PNNs for five languages: English,
Spanish, French, Dutch, and German. Consistent with previous work, we find that
the PNNs share a consistent set of topological features. Using an approach that
generates random lexicons with increasing levels of phonological realism, we
show that even random forms with minimal relationship to any real language,
combined with only the empirical distribution of language-specific phonological
form lengths, are sufficient to produce the topological properties observed in
the real language PNNs. The resulting pseudo-PNNs are insensitive to the level
of lingusitic realism in the random lexicons but quite sensitive to the shape
of the form length distribution. We therefore conclude that ""universal""
features seen across multiple languages are really string universals, not
language universals, and arise primarily due to limitations in the kinds of
networks generated by the one-step neighbor definition. Taken together, our
results indicate that caution is warranted when linking the dynamics of human
spoken word recognition to the topological properties of PNNs, and that the
investigation of alternative similarity metrics for phonological forms should
be a priority.

revisited. A popular tool to assess the reliability of ensemble forecasting
systems (for scalar verifications) is the rank histogram, this histogram is
expected to be more or less flat, since for a reliable ensemble, the ranks are
uniformly distributed among their possible outcomes. Quantitative tests for
flatness (e.g.\ Pearson's goodness--of--fit test) have been suggested, without
exception though, these tests assume the ranks to be a sequence of independent
random variables, which is not the case in general as can be demonstrated with
simple toy examples. In this paper, tests are developed that take the temporal
correlations between the ranks into account. A refined analysis shows that
exploiting the reliability property, the ranks still exhibit strong decay of
correlations. This property is key to the analysis, and the proposed tests are
valid for general ensemble forecasting systems with minimal extraneous

open channel can be well described by a physical pore where ions follow
statistical physics. Nevertheless real molecular channels are active pores with

specifically ion positions and gate states, which follow Langevin equations
constructed from an unique potential energy functional and by using standard
rules of statistical physics. Numerical simulations of both models are
implemented and the results show that they have dynamical properties very close

a significant effect of the external ion concentration on gating dynamics is
predicted, which is consistent with previous experimental observations. This
approach can be extended to other channel types with more specific

sketch size or the optimal number of redundant bits is $\Theta(k \log
\frac{n}{k})$. However, known constructions are far from achieving these
bounds.
  We significantly improve previous results on both problems. For document
exchange, we give an efficient deterministic protocol with sketch size
$O(k\log^2 \frac{n}{k})$. This significantly improves the previous best known
deterministic protocol, which has sketch size $O(k^2 + k \log^2 n)$
(Belazzougui15). For binary insdel codes, we obtain the following results:
  1. An explicit binary insdel code which encodes an $n$-bit message $x$
against $k$ errors with redundancy $O(k \log^2 \frac{n}{k})$. In particular
this implies an explicit family of binary insdel codes that can correct
$\varepsilon$ fraction of insertions and deletions with rate $1-O(\varepsilon
\log^2 (\frac{1}{\varepsilon}))=1-\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon)$.
  2. An explicit binary insdel code which encodes an $n$-bit message $x$
against $k$ errors with redundancy $O(k \log n)$. This is the first explicit
construction of binary insdel codes that has optimal redundancy for a wide
range of error parameters $k$, and this brings our understanding of binary
insdel codes much closer to that of standard binary error correcting codes.
  In obtaining our results we introduce the notion of \emph{$\varepsilon$-self
matching hash functions} and \emph{$\varepsilon$-synchronization hash
functions}. We believe our techniques can have further applications in the
literature.

model that incorporates the pairing interaction. It is a schematic model that
describes the interplay between particle-hole and pair correlations. It was
proposed in the 1960's by D. Agassi as a model to simulate the properties of
the quadrupole plus pairing model.
  Purpose: The aim of this work is to extend a previous study by Davis and
Heiss generalizing the Agassi model and analyze in detail the phase diagram of
the model as well as the different regions with coexistence of several phases.
  Method: We solve the model Hamiltonian through the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
(HFB) approximation, introducing two variational parameters that play the role
of order parameters. We also compare the HFB calculations with the exact ones.
  Results: We obtain the phase diagram of the model and classify the order of
the different quantum phase transitions appearing in the diagram. The phase
diagram presents broad regions where several phases, up to three, coexist.
Moreover, there is also a line and a point where four and five phases are
degenerated, respectively.
  Conclusions: The phase diagram of the extended Agassi model presents a rich
variety of phases. Phase coexistence is present in extended areas of the
parameter space. The model could be an important tool for benchmarking novel
many-body approximations.

class of $B$ as vertex set, say $X$; two vertices are adjacent whenever they
have a common neighbor in $Y$. Every planar graph is a half-square of a planar
bipartite graph, namely of its subdivision. Until recently, only half-squares
of planar bipartite graphs, also known as map graphs (Chen, Grigni and
Papadimitriou [STOC 1998, J. ACM 2002]), have been investigated, and the most
discussed problem is whether it is possible to recognize these graphs faster
and simpler than Thorup's $O(n^{120})$-time algorithm (Thorup [FOCS 1998]).
  In this paper, we identify the first hardness case, namely that deciding if a
graph is a half-square of a balanced bisplit graph is NP-complete. (Balanced
bisplit graphs form a proper subclass of star convex bipartite graphs.) For
classical subclasses of tree convex bipartite graphs such as biconvex, convex,
and chordal bipartite graphs, we give good structural characterizations of
their half-squares that imply efficient recognition algorithms. As a
by-product, we obtain new characterizations of unit interval graphs, interval
graphs, and of strongly chordal graphs in terms of half-squares of biconvex
bipartite, convex bipartite, and of chordal bipartite graphs, respectively.
Good characterizations of half-squares of star convex and star biconvex
bipartite graphs are also given, giving linear-time recognition algorithms for
these half-squares.

constancy of the structure functions of the global frame defining the

more fundamental level we inquire if the integrability condition of the almost

decreases with the continuum flux density, which translates into a decrease
with the H2 column density within an individual envelope. Our analysis show
that the envelope-scale magnetic field is preferentially observed either
aligned or perpendicular to the outflow direction. Interestingly, our results
suggest for the first time a relation between the orientation of the magnetic
field and the rotational energy of envelopes, with a larger occurrence of
misalignment in sources where strong rotational motions are detected at
hundreds to thousands of au scales. We also show that the best agreement
between the magnetic field and outflow orientation is found in sources showing
no small-scale multiplicity and no large disks at about 100 au scales.

acoustic boundary layer forming near the wall. The width of this layer is
typically much smaller than the bulk length scale set by the geometry or the
acoustic wavelength, which makes direct numerical simulations challenging.
Based on this separation in length scales, we extend the classical theory of
pressure acoustics by deriving a boundary condition for the acoustic pressure
that takes boundary-layer effects fully into account. Using the same
length-scale separation for the steady second-order streaming, and combining it
with time-averaged short-range products of first-order fields, we replace the
usual limiting-velocity theory with an analytical slip-velocity condition on
the long-range streaming field at the wall. The derived boundary conditions are
valid for oscillating cavities of arbitrary shape and wall motion as long as
the wall curvature and displacement amplitude are both sufficiently small.
Finally, we validate our theory by comparison with direct numerical simulation
in two examples of two-dimensional water-filled cavities: The well-studied
rectangular cavity with prescribed wall actuation, and the more generic
elliptical cavity embedded in an externally actuated rectangular elastic glass
block.

trajectory from an initial state to a goal region when the obstacle space is
a-priori unknown and is incrementally revealed online, e.g., through
line-of-sight perception. Despite its ubiquitous nature, this formulation of
motion planning has received relatively little theoretical investigation, as
opposed to the setup where the environment is assumed known. A fundamental
challenge is that, unlike motion planning with known obstacles, it is not even
clear what an optimal policy to strive for is. Our contribution is threefold.
First, we present a notion of optimality for safe planning in unknown
environments in the spirit of comparative (as opposed to competitive) analysis,
with the goal of obtaining a benchmark that is, at least conceptually,
attainable. Second, by leveraging this theoretical benchmark, we derive a
pseudo-optimal class of policies that can seamlessly incorporate any amount of
prior or learned information while still guaranteeing the robot never collides.
Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our algorithmic approach in
numerical experiments using a range of environment types and dynamics,
including a comparison with a state of the art method. A key aspect of our
framework is that it automatically and implicitly weighs exploration versus
exploitation in a way that is optimal with respect to the information
available.

systems requires provable guarantees on their correct behaviour. A common
requirement is robustness to adversarial perturbations in a neighbourhood
around an input. In this paper we focus on the $L_0$ norm and aim to compute,
for a trained DNN and an input, the maximal radius of a safe norm ball around
the input within which there are no adversarial examples. Then we define global
robustness as an expectation of the maximal safe radius over a test data set.
We first show that the problem is NP-hard, and then propose an approximate
approach to iteratively compute lower and upper bounds on the network's
robustness. The approach is \emph{anytime}, i.e., it returns intermediate
bounds and robustness estimates that are gradually, but strictly, improved as
the computation proceeds; \emph{tensor-based}, i.e., the computation is
conducted over a set of inputs simultaneously, instead of one by one, to enable
efficient GPU computation; and has \emph{provable guarantees}, i.e., both the
bounds and the robustness estimates can converge to their optimal values.
Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach in practice to
compute tight bounds by applying and adapting the anytime algorithm to a set of
challenging problems, including global robustness evaluation, competitive $L_0$
attacks, test case generation for DNNs, and local robustness evaluation on
large-scale ImageNet DNNs. We release the code of all case studies via GitHub.

problem of crafting physical adversarial perturbations to fool image-based

difficult than attacking an image classifier, as it needs to mislead the
classification results in multiple bounding boxes with different scales.
Extending the digital attack to the physical world adds another layer of
difficulty, because it requires the perturbation to be robust enough to survive
real-world distortions due to different viewing distances and angles, lighting
conditions, and camera limitations. We show that the Expectation over
Transformation technique, which was originally proposed to enhance the
robustness of adversarial perturbations in image classification, can be
successfully adapted to the object detection setting. ShapeShifter can generate
adversarially perturbed stop signs that are consistently mis-detected by Faster
R-CNN as other objects, posing a potential threat to autonomous vehicles and
other safety-critical computer vision systems.

indicators (KPIs) of multidimensional constellations that should be considered

on the known multidimensional constellations in the context of SCMA systems

that multidimensional constellations that satisfy KPIs of a certain channel

different temporal snapshots of the network. Accurate modeling of this temporal
evolution can help solve complex tasks involving real-life social and
interaction networks. However, existing models for learning latent
representation are inadequate for obtaining the representation vectors of the
vertices for different time-stamps of a dynamic network in a meaningful way. In
this paper, we propose latent representation learning models for dynamic
networks which overcome the above limitation by considering two different kinds
of temporal smoothness: (i) retrofitted, and (ii) linear transformation. The
retrofitted model tracks the representation vector of a vertex over time,
facilitating vertex-based temporal analysis of a network. On the other hand,
linear transformation based model provides a smooth transition operator which
maps the representation vectors of all vertices from one temporal snapshot to
the next (unobserved) snapshot-this facilitates prediction of the state of a
network in a future time-stamp. We validate the performance of our proposed
models by employing them for solving the temporal link prediction task.
Experiments on 9 real-life networks from various domains validate that the
proposed models are significantly better than the existing models for
predicting the dynamics of an evolving network.

obstruction is the only obstruction to the existence of rational points on $X$
over all finite extensions of $k$, then the $2$-primary Brauer-Manin

distribution in the optical regions of those galaxies. Dark matter (DM) models
are constructed using the isothermal core profile and the Navarro-Frenk-White
cuspy profile. We allow the M/L of the baryonic disc to vary or we keep it
fixed, constrained by stellar evolutionary models (WISE W$_1$-W$_2$ color) and
we carry out best fit (BFM) and pseudo-isothermal maximum disc (MDM) models. We
found that the MDM provides M/L values four times higher than the BFM,
suggesting that disc components, on average, tend to be maximal. The main
results are: (i) the rotation curves of most galaxies are better fitted with
core rather than cuspy profiles; (ii) the relation between the parameters of
the DM and of the luminous matter components mostly depends on morphological
types. More precisely, the distribution of the DM inside galaxies depends on
whether or not the galaxy has a bulge.

brain networks remains a crucial issue in modern neuroscience. Recently, there
has been growing interest in investigating the role of homeostatic plasticity
mechanisms, across different spatiotemporal scales, in regulating network
activity and brain functioning against a wide range of environmental conditions
and brain states (e.g., during learning, development, ageing, neurological
diseases). In the present study, we investigate how the inclusion of
homeostatic plasticity in a stochastic whole-brain model, implemented as a
normalization of the incoming node's excitatory input, affects the macroscopic
activity during rest and the formation of functional networks. Importantly, we
address the structure-function relationship both at the group and
individual-based levels. In this work, we show that normalization of the node's
excitatory input improves the correspondence between simulated neural patterns
of the model and various brain functional data. Indeed, we find that the best
match is achieved when the model control parameter is in its critical value and
that normalization minimizes both the variability of the critical points and
neuronal activity patterns among subjects. Therefore, our results suggest that
the inclusion of homeostatic principles lead to more realistic brain activity
consistent with the hallmarks of criticality. Our theoretical framework open
new perspectives in personalized brain modeling with potential applications to
investigate the deviation from criticality due to structural lesions (e.g.
stroke) or brain disorders.

preserves spatial structures and semantic information, in both an image

source domain and unlabeled samples from the target domain, the generator
synthesizes new images on-the-fly to resemble samples from the target domain in
appearance and the segmentation network further refines high-level features
before predicting semantic maps, both of which leverage feature statistics of
sampled images from the target domain. Unlike much recent and concurrent work
relying on adversarial training, our framework is lightweight and easy to
train. Extensive experiments on adapting models trained on synthetic

this feature appears at the correct wavelength (corresponding to a redshift

radio absorption is by the enhancement of the diffuse radio background at $\nu

hydrogen. Astrophysical scenarios, based on the acceleration of relativistic
electrons by accretion on to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and by supernovae

synchrotron or the inverse-Compton (IC) cooling time for such electrons is at
least three orders of magnitude shorter than the duration of the EDGES signal
centered at $z \approx 17$, irrespective of the magnetic field strength. The
synchrotron radio emission at 1.42 GHz due to rapidly cooling electrons is

initial semilatus recti larger than 12 AU, implying no interaction if the
orbits were isolated. However, taking into account dynamical evolution, we find
that $\approx 0.4$ ($\approx 0.6$) of 2+2 (3+1) systems interact. In
particular, Roche Lobe overflow can be triggered possibly in highly eccentric
orbits, dynamical instability can ensue due to mass-loss-driven orbital
expansion or secular evolution, or a semisecular regime can be entered. We
compute the delay-time distributions (DTDs) of collision-induced SNe Ia, and
find that they are flatter compared to the observed DTD. Moreover, our combined
SNe Ia rates are $(3.7\pm0.7) \times 10^{-6} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot^{-1}$ and
$(1.3\pm0.2) \times 10^{-6} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot^{-1}$ for 2+2 and 3+1 systems,
respectively, three orders of magnitude lower compared to the observed rate, of
order $10^{-3} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot^{-1}$. The low rates can be ascribed to
interactions before the stars evolve to CO WDs. However, our results are lower
limits given that we considered a subset of quadruple systems.

host. Due to the copious radiative power of the nucleus, the effects of
radiative feedback can be detected over the entire host galaxy and sometimes
well into the intergalactic space. In this paper we model the observed
size-luminosity relationship of the narrow-line regions (NLRs) of AGN. We model
the NLR as a collection of clouds in pressure equilibrium with the ionizing
radiation, with each cloud producing line emission calculated by Cloudy. The
sizes of the NLRs of powerful quasars are reproduced without any free
parameters, as long as they contain massive ($10^5 - 10^7 M_\odot$)
ionization-bounded clouds. At lower AGN luminosities the observed sizes are
larger than the model sizes, likely due to additional unmodeled sources of
ionization (e.g., star formation). We find that the observed saturation of
sizes at $\sim 10$ kpc which is observed at high AGN luminosities
($L_\text{ion} \simeq 10^{46}$ erg/s) is naturally explained by optically thick
clouds absorbing the ionizing radiation and preventing illumination beyond a
critical distance. Using our models in combination with observations of the [O
III]/IR ratio and the [O III] size -- IR luminosity relationship, we calculate
the covering factor of the obscuring torus (and therefore the type 2 fraction
within the quasar population) to be $f=0.5$, though this is likely an upper
bound. Finally, because the gas behind the ionization front is invisible in
ionized gas transitions, emission-based NLR mass calculations underestimate the
mass of the NLR and therefore of the energetics of ionized-gas winds.

Solution (TGAS) from the first Gaia Data Release. Using binary stellar
evolution simulations, we make predictions for the runaway and equatorial
rotation velocities of a runaway Be star population. Accounting for
observational biases, we calculate that if all classical Be stars originated
through mass transfer in binaries, then $17.5\%$ of the Be stars in our
catalogue should be runaways. The remaining $82.5\%$ should be in binaries with
subdwarfs, white dwarfs or neutron stars, because those systems either remained
bound post-supernova or avoided the supernova entirely. Using a Bayesian
methodology, we compare the hypothesis that each Be star in our catalogue is a
runaway to the null hypothesis that it is a member of the Milky Way disc. We
find that $13.1^{+2.6}_{-2.4}\%$ of the Be stars in our catalogue are runaways,
and identify a subset of 40 high-probability runaways. We argue that
deficiencies in our understanding of binary stellar evolution, as well as the
degeneracy between velocity dispersion and number of runaway stars, can explain
the slightly lower runaway fraction. We thus conclude that all Be stars could
be explained by an origin in mass-transfer binaries. This conclusion is
testable with the second Gaia data release (DR2).

parameterized attenuation curves determined with the CIGALE SED fitting code.
Attenuation curve slopes and UV bump strengths are reasonably well constrained
independently from one another. We find that $A_{\lambda}/A_V$ attenuation
curves exhibit a very wide range of slopes that are on average as steep as the
SMC curve slope. The slope is a strong function of optical opacity. Opaque
galaxies have shallower curves - in agreement with recent radiate transfer
models. The dependence of slopes on the opacity produces an apparent dependence
on stellar mass: more massive galaxies having shallower slopes. Attenuation
curves exhibit a wide range of UV bump amplitudes, from none to MW-like; with
an average strength 1/3 of the MW bump. Notably, local analogs of high-redshift
galaxies have an average curve that is somewhat steeper than the SMC curve,
with a modest UV bump that can be to first order ignored, as its effect on the
near-UV magnitude is 0.1 mag. Neither the slopes nor the strengths of the UV
bump depend on gas-phase metallicity. Functional forms for attenuation laws are

Milky Way from the detailed chemistry and kinematics of millions of stars.
Wide-field multi-fibre spectrographs are increasingly used to obtain spectral
information for huge samples of stars. Some surveys (e.g. GALAH) are attempting
to measure up to 30 separate elements per star. Stellar abundance spectroscopy
is a subtle art that requires a very high degree of spectral uniformity across
each of the fibres. However wide-field spectrographs are notoriously
non-uniform due to the fast output optics necessary to image many fibre outputs
onto the detector. We show that precise spectroscopy is possible with such
instruments across all fibres by employing a photonic comb -- a device that
produces uniformly spaced spots of light on the CCD to precisely map complex
aberrations. Aberrations are parametrized by a set of orthogonal moments with
$\sim100$ independent parameters. We then reproduce the observed image by
convolving high resolution spectral templates with measured aberrations as
opposed to extracting the spectra from the observed image. Such a forward
modeling approach also trivializes some spectroscopic reduction problems like
fibre cross-talk, and reliably extracts spectra with a resolution $\sim2.3$
times above the nominal resolution of the instrument. Our rigorous treatment of
optical aberrations also encourages a less conservative spectrograph design in
the future.

Every galaxy in EDGE has corresponding resolved ionized gas measurements from
CALIFA. Using a sub-sample of 17 rotation dominated, star-forming galaxies
where precise molecular gas rotation curves could be extracted, we derive CO
and H$\alpha$ rotation curves using the same geometric parameters out to
$\gtrsim$1 $R_e$. We find that $\sim$75% of our sample galaxies have smaller
ionized gas rotation velocities than the molecular gas in the outer part of the
rotation curve. In no case is the molecular gas rotation velocity measurably
lower than that of the ionized gas. We suggest that the lower ionized gas
rotation velocity can be attributed to a significant contribution from
extraplanar diffuse ionized gas in a thick, turbulence supported disk. Using
observations of the H$\gamma$ transition also available from CALIFA, we measure
ionized gas velocity dispersions and find that these galaxies have sufficiently
large velocity dispersions to support a thick ionized gas disk. Kinematic
simulations show that a thick disk with a vertical rotation velocity gradient
can reproduce the observed differences between the CO and H$\alpha$ rotation
velocities. Observed line ratios tracing diffuse ionized gas are elevated
compared to typical values in the midplane of the Milky Way. In galaxies
affected by this phenomenon, dynamical masses measured using ionized gas
rotation curves will be systematically underestimated.

specializing first for simplicity to a Rindler wedge of AdS$_3$, we find that
generic curves within the wedge are in fact not fully reconstructible with
entanglement entropies in the corresponding boundary region, even after using
the most general variant of hole-ography, which was recently shown to suffice
for reconstruction of arbitrary spacelike curves in the Poincare patch. This
limitation is an analog of the familiar phenomenon of entanglement shadows,
which we call 'entanglement shade'. We overcome it by showing that the
information about the nonreconstructible curve segments is encoded in a slight
generalization of the concept of entanglement of purification, whose
holographic dual has been discussed very recently. We introduce the notion of
'differential purification', and demonstrate that, in combination with
differential entropy, it enables the complete reconstruction of all spacelike

There are two possible approaches to this problem. The first one is simple and
does not utilize entanglement. We focus only on the discrimination of classical
probability distributions, which are outputs of the channels. We find necessary
and sufficient criterion for perfect discrimination in this case. A more
advanced approach requires the usage of entanglement. We quantify the distance
between two measurements in terms of the diamond norm (called sometimes the
completely bounded trace norm). We provide an exact expression for the optimal
probability of correct distinction and relate it to the discrimination of
unitary channels. We also state a necessary and sufficient condition for
perfect discrimination and a semidefinite program which checks this condition.
Our main result, however, is a cone program which calculates the distance
between the measurements and hence provides an upper bound on the probability
of their correct distinction. As a by-product, the program finds a strategy
(input state) which achieves this bound. Finally, we provide a full description

$\#|C(\mathbb{Q})|$ is bounded. The argument follows the same ideas as the
sphere-packing proof of boundedness of the average number of integral points on
(quasiminimal Weierstrass models of) elliptic curves. That is, we bound the
number of small-height points by hand, the number of medium-height points by
establishing an explicit Mumford gap principle and using the theorem of
Kabatiansky-Levenshtein on spherical codes (this technique goes back to work of
Silverman, Helfgott, and Helfgott-Venkatesh), and the number of large-height
points by using Bombieri-Vojta's proof of Faltings' theorem.
  Explicitly, in dealing with non-small-height points we prove that the number
of rational points $(x,y)$ on $C_f: y^2 = f(x)$ satisfying $h(x) > 8 h(f)$ is
$\ll 1.872^{\mathrm{rank}(\mathrm{Jac}(C)(\mathbb{Q}))}$, which has finite

groups of Jacobians over this family. We note that our arguments in the
small-height and large-height cases extend to general genera $g\geq 2$, though
for medium points we need to use Stoll's bounds on the non-Archimedean local
height differences in genus $2$. For example, we prove that the number of
rational points $P\in C(\mathbb{Q})$ with $h(P)\gg_g h(C)$ on $C/\mathbb{Q}$
smooth projective and of genus $g\geq 2$ is $\ll
1.872^{\mathrm{rank}(\mathrm{Jac}(C)(\mathbb{Q}))}$, and that in fact the base
of the exponent can be reduced to $1.311$ once $g\gg 1$, though this is surely

long-period fundamental mode pulsations, and radiation-dominated envelopes in
massive stars. Our data can be used to place stringent constraints on the
precise onset of these various instabilities and their lifetimes and growth

cosmology-independent way by measuring the differential age evolution of cosmic
chronometers. This yields a measurement of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ as a
function of redshift. The most reliable cosmic chronometers known so far are
extremely massive and passively evolving galaxies. Age-dating these galaxies
is, however, a difficult task, and even a small contribution of an underlying
young stellar population could, in principle, affect the age estimate and its
cosmological interpretation. We present several spectral indicators to detect,
quantify and constrain such contamination in old galaxies, and study how their
combination can be used to maximize the purity of cosmic chronometers
selection. In particular, we analyze the CaII H/K ratio, the presence (or
absence) of H$\alpha$ and [OII] emission lines, higher order Balmer absorption
lines, and UV flux; each indicator is especially sensitive to a particular age
range, allowing us to detect young components ranging between 10 Myr and 1 Gyr.
The combination of these indicators minimizes the contamination to a level
below 1% in the case of ideal data. More importantly, it offers a way to
control the systematic error on $H(z)$ as a function of the contamination by
young stellar populations. We show that for our previous measurements of the
Hubble parameter, the possible bias induced by the presence of a younger
component is well below the current errors. We envision that these indicators
will be instrumental in paving the road for a robust and reliable dating of the
old population and its cosmological interpretation.

simulations must span the relevant model parameter spaces, be large enough to
obtain the precision demanded by upcoming data, and be thoroughly validated in
order to ensure accuracy. In this paper we present one such suite of

47 different wCDM cosmologies spanning the range of parameter space allowed by
the combination of recent Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic

several observables including spherical overdensity halo mass functions, galaxy
projected correlation functions, galaxy clustering in redshift space, and
matter and halo correlation functions and power spectra. We show that these

Mpc^-1 in harmonic space for z\le 1. We find that the dominant source of
uncertainty comes from varying the particle loading of the simulations. This
leads to large systematic errors for statistics using halos with fewer than 200
particles and scales smaller than k ~ 4 h^-1 Mpc. We provide the halo catalogs

more languages under varied social constraints. The code-switching data differ
so radically from the benchmark corpora used in NLP community that the
application of standard technologies to these data degrades their performance
sharply. Unlike standard corpora, these data often need to go through
additional processes such as language identification, normalization and/or
back-transliteration for their efficient processing. In this paper, we
investigate these indispensable processes and other problems associated with
syntactic parsing of code-switching data and propose methods to mitigate their
effects. In particular, we study dependency parsing of code-switching data of
Hindi and English multilingual speakers from Twitter. We present a treebank of
Hindi-English code-switching tweets under Universal Dependencies scheme and
propose a neural stacking model for parsing that efficiently leverages
part-of-speech tag and syntactic tree annotations in the code-switching

related to the multiplicative coalescent (the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph,
more generally the so-called rank-one inhomogeneous random graphs of various
types, and the configuration model). At the discrete level, the construction
relies on a new point of view on (discrete) inhomogeneous random graphs that
involves an embedding into a Galton--Watson forest. The new representation
allows us to demonstrate that a processus that was already present in the

Aldous and Limic [Electron. J. Probab., vol.~3, pp.~1--59, 1998] about the

paralleled by an embedding of the encoding process into a L\'evy process which
is crucial in proving the very existence of the local time functionals on which
the metric is based; it also yields a transparent approach to compactness and
fractal dimensions of the continuous objects. In a companion paper, we show

investigate the role of CRs in the vicinity of a compact young star cluster. We
model a self-gravitating cloud (density profile $\rho \propto r^{-1}$), include
important thermal and non-thermal processes, and explore two different CR
injection scenarios. We show that if internal shocks in the wind-driving region
are the main site for CR acceleration, then the resulting $\gamma$-ray
luminosity ($L_{\rm \gamma}$) can reach $\approx 5\%$ of the mechanical
luminosity ($L_{\rm w}$), independent of the fraction of wind energy ($\sim
1-20\%$) injected into CRs. In contrast, if the forward/reverse shock of a
bubble is the injection site then $L_{\rm \gamma}$ increases linearly with the
CR injection fraction, as expected analytically. We find that the X-ray
luminosity ($L_{\rm x}$) in the forward/reverse shock injection scenario is
$\gtrsim 10^{-3} L_{\rm w}$, which is $\sim 10$ times larger than in the
central wind-driving injection case. We predict the corresponding range of the
synchrotron radio luminosity. We show how multi-wavelength observations can
constrain the CR parameters. Comparing the predicted multi-wavelength
luminosities with those of 30 Doradus we identify the reverse shock as the most
probable CR injection site, and that thermal conduction is important. We do not
find significant dynamical impact of CRs in our models.

number of antennas at the base station to increase the data rate and user
density in future wireless systems. For simulation, it has become common
practice to use i.i.d. complex Gaussian matrix entries to obtain an average
MIMO channel behavior. More refined models have been devised and proposed to
standardization bodies; yet, channel modeling remains an active area of
research, as current models tend to be, still, quite limited, e.g., when it
comes to evaluating clustering algorithms, with regions of spatial
orthogonality for concurrent scheduling of users, which is an essential concept
in massive MIMO precoding. For this, spatial correlations need to be included.
To further refine channel modeling, we have built a ""spider antenna"" prototype
that allows spatially continuous measurements in three dimensions, enabling a
high-resolution sampling over, initially, a volume of 2m x 2m x 2m for indoor
measurements. Several experiments have been conducted to illustrate the new
insights to be gained when studying user orthogonality, clustering and
precoding in a massive MIMO context. Furthermore, the influence of antenna

methods of constructing Wald-type confidence interval in the presence of
missing data where the missingness mechanism is ignorable. We find that
constructing confidence intervals using multiple imputation (MI) based on
logistic regression (LR) gives the most robust coverage probability and the
choice of CI method is less important. However, when missingness rate is less
severe (e.g. less than 70%), we recommend using Newcombe's Wald method for
constructing confidence intervals along with multiple imputation using

Gaussian entries, extended by the Kronecker and Weichselberger model. One
reason for observing a gap between modeled and actual channel behavior is the
absence of spatial consistency in many such models, that is, spatial
correlations over an area in the x, y-dimensions are not accounted for, making
it difficult to study, e.g., area-throughput measures. In this paper, we
propose an algorithm that can distinguish between regions of non-line-of-sight

""area-throughput"". For evaluating the proposed orthogonality clustering scheme
we use a simple filtered MIMO channel model which is spatially consistent, with
known degrees of freedom. Moreover, we employ actual (spatially consistent)
area channel measurements based on spatial sampling using a spider antenna and

reciprocity within the coherence time, avoiding feedback of channel state

the idea of exploiting reciprocity to the coherence bandwidth, allocating
subcarriers of a multicarrier (OFDM)-based system in an interlaced fashion to
up- and downlink, respectively, referred to as (OFDM-)subcarrier interlaced FDD
(IFDD). Exploiting this ""two-dimensional"" channel reciprocity within both time
and frequency coherence does not require any CSI feedback and, even more so,
offers faster-than-TDD channel tracking. To address imperfections of actual
hardware, we conducted measurements, verifying the practical viability of IFDD.
As it turns out, the scheme incurs similar transmit/receive isolation issues
(self-interference) as well-known from the full-duplex (FDup) literature. As
will be shown, such hardware challenges like self-interference or frequency
offsets are not critical for massive MIMO operation, but can be neglected as
the number of antennas grows large. Finally, we quantify how IFDD allows to
track the channel variations much faster than TDD over a wide range of commonly
used pilot symbol rates.

MapReduce is crucial as the nature of cloud applications is becoming
increasingly mission-critical and deadline-sensitive. It has been shown that
the execution times of MapReduce jobs are often adversely impacted by a few
slow tasks, known as stragglers, which result in high latency and deadline
violations. While a number of strategies have been developed in existing work
to mitigate stragglers by launching speculative or clone task attempts, none of
them provides a quantitative framework that optimizes the speculative execution
for offering guaranteed Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to meet application
deadlines. In this paper, we bring several speculative scheduling strategies
together under a unifying optimization framework, called Chronos, which defines
a new metric, Probability of Completion before Deadlines (PoCD), to measure the
probability that MapReduce jobs meet their desired deadlines. We systematically
analyze PoCD for popular strategies including Clone, Speculative-Restart, and
Speculative-Resume, and quantify their PoCD in closed-form. The result
illuminates an important tradeoff between PoCD and the cost of speculative
execution, measured by the total (virtual) machine time required under
different strategies. We propose an optimization problem to jointly optimize
PoCD and execution cost in different strategies, and develop an algorithmic
solution that is guaranteed to be optimal. Chronos is prototyped on Hadoop
MapReduce and evaluated against three baseline strategies using both
experiments and trace-driven simulations, achieving 50% net utility increase
with up to 80% PoCD and 88% cost improvements.

product of localized, equator-ward landsliding from the surface of an asteroid
rotating at the brink of instability. We obtained new Hubble Space Telescope
observations to directly measure the nucleus and to search for evidence of its
rapid rotation. However, instead of providing photometric evidence for rapid
nucleus rotation, our data set a lower limit to the lightcurve period, $P \ge$
5.4 hour. The dominant feature of the lightcurve is a V-shaped minimum,
$\sim$0.3 magnitudes deep, that is suggestive of an eclipsing binary. Under
this interpretation, the time-series data are consistent with a
secondary/primary mass ratio, $m_s/m_p \sim$ 1:6, a ratio of separation/primary
radius, $r/r_p \sim$ 4 and an orbit period $\sim$0.8 days. These properties lie
within the range of other asteroid binaries that are thought to be formed by
rotational breakup. While the lightcurve period is long, centripetal dust
ejection is still possible if one or both components rotates rapidly
($\lesssim$ 2 hour) and has a small lightcurve variation because of azimuthal
symmetry. Indeed, radar observations of asteroids in critical rotation reveal
""muffin-shaped"" morphologies which are closely azimuthally symmetric and which
show minimal lightcurves. Our data are consistent with 311P being a close
binary in which one or both components rotates near the centripetal limit. The
mass loss in 2013 suggests that breakup occurred recently and could even be
on-going. A search for fragments that might have been recently ejected beyond
the Hill sphere reveals none larger than effective radius $r_e \sim$ 10 m.

the nu1 fundamental band of OCS (2050 cm-1), and N2O-HCCCCH, in the region of
the nu1 fundamental band of N2O (2200 cm-1), were observed in a pulsed
supersonic slit jet expansion probed with tunable diode/QCL lasers. Both
OCS-HCCCCH and N2O-HCCCCH were found to have planar structure with side-by-side
monomer units having nearly parallel axes. These bands have hybrid rotational
structure which allows for estimates of the orientation of OCS and N2O in the
plane of their respective dimers. Analogous bands for OCS-DCCCCD and N2O-DCCCCD
were also observed and found to be consistent with the normal isotopologues.
Various levels of ab initio calculations were performed to find stationary
points on the potential energy surface, optimized structures and interaction
energies. Four stable geometries were found for OCS-HCCCCH and three for
N2O-HCCCCH. The rotational parameters at CCSD(T*)-F12c level of theory give
results in very good agreement with those obtained from the observed spectra.
In both dimers, the experimental structure corresponds to the lowest energy
isomer.

transportation agencies to manage recurrent and non-recurrent congestion. ATM
systems rely on the interconnectivity of components made possible by wired
and/or wireless networks. Unfortunately, this connectivity that supports ATM
systems also provides potential system access points that results in
vulnerability to cyberattacks. This is becoming more pronounced as ATM systems
begin to integrate internet of things (IoT) devices. Hence, there is a need to
rigorously evaluate ATM systems for cyberattack vulnerabilities, and explore
design concepts that provide stability and graceful degradation in the face of
cyberattacks. In this research, a prototype ATM system along with a real-time
cyberattack monitoring system were developed for a 1.5-mile section of I-66 in
Northern Virginia. The monitoring system detects deviation from expected
operation of an ATM system by comparing lane control states generated by the
ATM system with lane control states deemed most likely by the monitoring
system. In case of any deviation between two sets of states, the monitoring
system displays the lane control states generated by the back-up data source.
In a simulation experiment, the prototype ATM system and cyberattack monitoring
system were subject to emulated cyberattacks. The evaluation results showed
that when subject to cyberattack, the mean speed reduced by 15% compared to the
case with the ATM system and was similar to the baseline case. This illustrates
that the effectiveness of the ATM system was negated by cyberattacks. The
monitoring system however, allowed the ATM system to revert to an expected safe
state and reduced the negative impact of cyberattacks. These results illustrate
the need to revisit ATM system design concepts as a means to protect against
cyberattacks in addition to traditional system intrusion prevention approaches.

on automating the measurement process rely on LIDAR measurements coupled with
high-accuracy GPS. Usually each side of a row is reconstructed independently
and then merged using GPS information. Such approaches have two disadvantages:
(1) they rely on specialized and expensive equipment, and (2) since the
reconstruction process does not simultaneously use information from both sides,
side reconstructions may not be accurate. We also show that standard loop
closure methods do not necessarily align tree trunks well. In this paper, we
present a novel vision system that employs only an RGB-D camera to estimate
morphological parameters. A semantics-based mapping algorithm merges the
two-sides 3D models of tree rows, where integrated semantic information is
obtained and refined by robust fitting algorithms. We focus on measuring tree

Gravitational Theory (DGT), a thermodynamic theory of induced gravity, and
allows to obtain the evolution of systems with the redshift. DGT reproduce the
ESO VLT observations, showing falling outer rotation curves for galaxies at
redshift above 0.77. A scaling law is observed in the radial acceleration
relation (RAR) of galaxies. For accelerations smaller than $\sim
10^{-10}ms^{-1}$ the observed acceleration $g_{obs}$ decreases more slowly than
acceleration generated by the baryonic mass $g_{bar}$, following always the
relation $g_{obs} \sim \sqrt{g_{bar}}$. The RAR does not care about the
specific properties of the galaxy, the relation exists in nearby high-mass
elliptical and low-mass spheroidal galaxies. In this paper, through a
straightforward analysis, we show that according to DGT, the RAR scaling law
observed in nearby galaxies is broken, when are considered distant galaxies.
The extreme case happen for galaxies at redshift above 0.77, because according
to DGT, the galaxies have declining rotation curves, and the rotation velocity
falling faster than the Keplerian-law curve. Then in this case $g_{obs}$
decreases more faster than $g_{bar}$, this means that $g_{obs}$ is
systematically lower than $g_{bar}$. We show that DGT prediction for the RAR of
galaxies at high redshift is in agreement from those obtained from the falling
rotation curves observed by VLT telescope.

rigorously demonstrate its advantage over the three-block sampler by comparing
specific spectral properties. In particular, we show that the Markov operator
corresponding to the two-block sampler is trace class (and hence
Hilbert-Schmidt), whereas the operator corresponding to the three-block sampler
is not even Hilbert-Schmidt. The trace class property for the two-block sampler
implies geometric convergence for the associated Markov chain, which justifies
the use of Markov chain CLT's to obtain practical error bounds for MCMC based
estimates. Additionally, it facilitates theoretical comparisons of the
two-block sampler with sandwich algorithms which aim to improve performance by
inserting inexpensive extra steps in between the two conditional draws of the

ultra-light axions, as they may provide a solution to the core-cusp problem at
the center of galaxies. Since very light bosons can have a de Broglie
wavelength that is of astrophysical size, they can smooth out the centers of
galaxies to produce a core, as opposed to vanilla dark matter models, and so it
has been suggested that this solves the core-cusp problem. In this work, we
critically examine this claim. While an ultra-light particle will indeed lead
to a core, we examine whether the relationship between the density of the core
and its radius matches the data over a range of galaxies. We first review data
that shows the core density of a galaxy $\rho_c$ varies as a function of the
core radius $R_c$ as $\rho_c\propto1/R_c^\beta$ with $\beta\approx1$. We then
compare this to theoretical models. We examine a large class of light scalar
dark matter models, governed by some potential $V$. For simplicity, we take the
scalar to be complex with a global $U(1)$ symmetry in order to readily organize
solutions by a conserved particle number. However, we expect our central
conclusions to persist even for a real scalar, and furthermore, a complex
scalar matches the behavior of a real scalar in the non-relativistic limit,
which is the standard regime of interest. For any potential $V$, we find the
relationship between $\rho_c$ and $R_c$ for ground state solutions is always in
one of the following regimes: (i) $\beta\gg1$, or (ii) $\beta\ll1$, or (iii)
unstable, and so it never matches the data. We also find similar conclusions
for virialized dark matter, more general scalar field theories, degenerate
fermion dark matter, superfluid dark matter, and general polytropes. We
conclude that the solution to the core-cusp problem is more likely due to
either complicated baryonic effects or some other type of dark matter
interactions.

Inspired by the idea of pseudo relevance feedback where top ranked documents,

A variety
of methods has been explored to debias click data for learning to rank such as
click models, result interleaving and, more recently, the unbiased
learning-to-rank framework based on inverse propensity weighting. Despite their
differences, most existing studies separate the estimation of click bias
(namely the \textit{propensity model}) from the learning of ranking algorithms.
To estimate click propensities, they either conduct online result
randomization, which can negatively affect the user experience, or offline
parameter estimation, which has special requirements for click data and is
optimized for objectives (e.g. click likelihood) that are not directly related
to the ranking performance of the system. In this work, we address those
problems by unifying the learning of propensity models and ranking models. We
find that the problem of estimating a propensity model from click data is a
dual problem of unbiased learning to rank. Based on this observation, we
propose a Dual Learning Algorithm (DLA) that jointly learns an unbiased ranker
and an \textit{unbiased propensity model}. DLA is an automatic unbiased
learning-to-rank framework as it directly learns unbiased ranking models from
biased click data without any preprocessing. It can adapt to the change of bias
distributions and is applicable to online learning. Our empirical experiments
with synthetic and real-world data show that the models trained with DLA
significantly outperformed the unbiased learning-to-rank algorithms based on

frequency, and the corresponding change of the capacitance will lead to a
measurable current. This scheme is scalable to multiple wires and therefore
enables us to precisely measure the tension of a large number of wires in a
short time. This technique can also be applied at cryogenic temperatures making
it an attractive solution for future large time-projection chambers such as the

particle-resolved Direct Numerical Simulations of cohesive sediment, based on
the Immersed Boundary Method. The model distributes the cohesive forces over a
thin shell surrounding each particle, thereby allowing for the spatial and
temporal resolution of the cohesive forces during particle-particle
interactions. The influence of the cohesive forces is captured by a single
dimensionless parameter in the form of a cohesion number, which represents the
ratio of cohesive and gravitational forces acting on a particle. We test and
validate the cohesive force model for binary particle interactions in the
Drafting-Kissing-Tumbling (DKT) configuration. The DKT simulations demonstrate
that cohesive particle pairs settle in a preferred orientation, with particles
of very different sizes preferentially aligning themselves in the vertical
direction, so that the smaller particle is drafted in the wake of the larger
one. To test this mechanism in a system of higher complexity, we perform large
simulations of 1,261 polydisperse settling particles starting from rest. These
simulations reproduce several earlier experimental observations by other
authors, such as the accelerated settling of sand and silt particles due to
particle bonding. The simulations demonstrate that cohesive forces accelerate
the overall settling process primarily because smaller grains attach to larger
ones and settle in their wakes. For the present cohesion number values, we
observe that settling can be accelerated by up to 29%. We propose physically
based parametrization of classical hindered settling functions proposed by
earlier authors, in order to account for cohesive forces. An investigation of
the energy budget shows that the work of the collision forces can substantially
modify the relevant energy conversion processes.

arguments-current state, action, and successor state; it is often simplified to
a function of two arguments-current state and action. The former is called a
transition-based reward function, whereas the latter is called a state-based
reward function. When the objective involves the expected cumulative reward
only, this simplification works perfectly. However, when the objective is
risk-sensitive, this simplification leads to an incorrect value. We present
state-augmentation transformations (SATs), which preserve the reward sequences
as well as the reward distributions and the optimal policy in risk-sensitive
reinforcement learning. In risk-sensitive scenarios, firstly we prove that, for
every MDP with a stochastic transition-based reward function, there exists an
MDP with a deterministic state-based reward function, such that for any given
(randomized) policy for the first MDP, there exists a corresponding policy for
the second MDP, such that both Markov reward processes share the same reward
sequence. Secondly we illustrate that two situations require the proposed SATs
in an inventory control problem. One could be using Q-learning (or other
learning methods) on MDPs with transition-based reward functions, and the other
could be using methods, which are for the Markov processes with a deterministic
state-based reward functions, on the Markov processes with general reward
functions. We show the advantage of the SATs by considering Value-at-Risk as an
example, which is a risk measure on the reward distribution instead of the
measures (such as mean and variance) of the distribution. We illustrate the
error in the reward distribution estimation from the direct use of Q-learning,
and show how the SATs enable a variance formula to work on Markov processes

earlier proposed physically universal cellular automata and Hamiltonians. These
are translation invariant interactions for which any control operation on a
finite target region can be implemented by the autonomous time evolution if the
complement of the target region is 'programmed' to an appropriate initial
state. This provides a model of control where the cut between a system and its
controller can be consistently shifted, in analogy to the Heisenberg cut
defining the boundary between a quantum system and its measurement device.
However, in the known physically universal CAs the implementation of
microscopic transformations requires to write the 'program' into microscopic
degrees of freedom, while human actions take place on the macroscopic level. I
therefore ask whether there exist physically universal interactions for which
any desired operation on a target region can be performed by only controlling
the macroscopic state of its surrounding. A very simple argument shows that
this is impossible with respect to the notion of 'macroscopic' proposed here:
control devices whose position is only specified up to 'macroscopic precision'
cannot operate at a precise location in space. This suggests that reasonable
notions of `universal controllability' need to be tailored to the manipulation
of relative coordinates, but it is not obvious how to do this. The statement
that any microscopic transformation can be implemented in principle, whenever
it is true in any sense, it does not seem to be true in its most obvious sense.

this paper we give a divide- and-conquer solution for the k-maximum subarray

  In the process of designing the combine phase of the algorithm we provide a

Here, we consider a communicability function that accounts for the routes

embedding of a network in a Euclidean high-dimensional sphere. We use one of
the geometric parameters of this embedding, namely the angle between the
position vectors of the nodes in the hyperspheres, to extract structural
information from networks. Such information is extracted by using machine
learning techniques, such as nonmetric multidimensional scaling and K-means
clustering algorithms. The first allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the
communicability hyperspheres to 3-dimensional ones that allow network
visualization. The second permits to cluster the nodes of the networks based on
their similarities in terms of their capacity to successfully deliver

based on the universal behavior of exit times for diffusion models. We give a
mathematically rigorous proof of the characteristic right skewness of the
incubation time distribution for very general one-dimensional diffusion models.
Imposing natural simple conditions on the drift coefficient, we also study
these diffusion models under the assumption of noise smallness and show that
the limiting exit time distributions in the limit of vanishing noise are
Gaussian and Gumbel. Thus they match the existing data as well as the other
existing models do. The character of our models, however, allows us to argue
that the features of the exit time distributions that we describe are universal
and manifest themselves in various other situations where the times involved
can be described as detection or halting times, for example, response times

content: Wiki, Q&A communities, etc. Understanding and modeling the different
collaborative behaviors is therefore critical. However, collaboration patterns
are difficult to capture when the relationships between users are not directly
observable, since they need to be inferred from the user actions. In this work,
we propose a solution to this problem by adopting a systemic view of
collaboration. Rather than modeling the users as independent actors in the
system, we capture their coordinated actions with embedding methods which can,
in turn, identify shared objectives and predict future user actions.
  To validate our approach, we perform a study on a dataset comprising more
than 16M user actions, recorded on the online collaborative sandbox Reddit
r/place. Participants had access to a drawing canvas where they could change
the color of one pixel at every fixed time interval. Users were not grouped in
teams nor were given any specific goals, yet they organized themselves into a
cohesive social fabric and collaborated to the creation of a multitude of
artworks. Our contribution in this paper is multi-fold: i) we perform an
in-depth analysis of the Reddit r/place collaborative sandbox, extracting
insights about its evolution over time; ii) we propose a predictive method that
captures the latent structure of the emergent collaborative efforts; and iii)
we show that our method provides an interpretable representation of the social

classically described through Gaussian kernels that decay with spatial
distance, angular distance and frequency distance. However, simultaneous
explanation of (a) distortion perception in natural image databases and (b)
contrast perception of artificial stimuli requires very specific modifications
in classical Divisive Normalization. First, the wavelet response has to be
high-pass filtered before the Gaussian interaction is applied. Then, distinct
weights per subband are also required after the Gaussian interaction. In
summary, the classical Gaussian kernel has to be left- and right-multiplied by
two extra diagonal matrices.
  In this paper we provide a lower-level justification for this specific
empirical modification required in the Gaussian kernel of Divisive
Normalization. Here we assume that the psychophysical behavior described by
Divisive Normalization comes from neural interactions following the
Wilson-Cowan equations. In particular, we identify the Divisive Normalization
response with the stationary regime of a Wilson-Cowan model. From this
identification we derive an expression for the Divisive Normalization kernel in
terms of the interaction kernel of the Wilson-Cowan equations. It turns out
that the Wilson-Cowan kernel is left- and-right multiplied by diagonal matrices
with high-pass structure. In conclusion, symmetric Gaussian inhibitory
relations between wavelet-like sensors wired in the lower-level Wilson-Cowan
model lead to the appropriate non-symmetric kernel that has to be empirically
included in Divisive Normalization to explain a wider range of phenomena.

extended ~ 180 au ring of dust around VLA 1623-A. This dust ring was previously
identified as a large disk in lower-resolution observations. We detect highly
structured dust polarization toward the inner disks and the extended ring with
typical polarization fractions ~ 1.7% and ~ 2.4%, respectively. The two
components also show distinct polarization morphologies. The inner disks have
uniform polarization angles aligned with their minor axes. This morphology is
consistent with expectations from dust scattering. By contrast, the extended
dust ring has an azimuthal polarization morphology not previously seen in
lower-resolution observations. We find that our observations are well fit by a
static, oblate spheroid model with a flux-frozen, poloidal magnetic field. We
propose that the polarization traces magnetic grain alignment likely from flux
freezing on large scales and magnetic diffusion on small scales. Alternatively,
the azimuthal polarization may be attributed to grain alignment by the
anisotropic radiation field. If the grains are radiatively aligned, then our
observations indicate that large (~ 100 um) dust grains grow quickly at large

deposit energy in the lower TR and chromosphere causing blueshifts (up
to~$\sim$~20 km/s) in the \emph{IRIS} \siiv~lines, which thermal conduction
cannot reproduce. The E$_\textrm{C}$ threshold value for the blueshifts depends
on the total energy of the events ($\approx$~5 keV for 10$^{24}$ ergs, up to 15
keV for 10$^{25}$ ergs). The observed footpoint emission intensity and flows,
combined with the simulations, can provide constraints on both the energy of
the heating event and E$_\textrm{C}$. The response of the loop plasma to
nanoflares depends crucially on the electron density: significant
\siiv~intensity enhancements and flows are observed only for initially
low-density loops ($<$~10$^{9}$~cm$^{-3}$). This provides a possible
explanation of the relative scarcity of observations of significant moss
variability. While the TR response to single heating episodes can be clearly
observed, the predicted coronal emission (AIA 94\AA) for single strands is

incurred. Kinetic energy of the cross flow is added to the energy balance.

we analyze the trade-off between the initial investment and the operating cost
for realistic usage scenarios to compare a fleet of electric semi-trucks with a
range of 500 miles with a fleet of diesel trucks. For the baseline case with
30% of fleet requiring battery pack replacements and a price differential of
US\$50,000, we find a payback period of about 3 years. Based on sensitivity
analysis, we find that the fraction of the fleet that requires battery pack
replacements is a major factor. For the case with 100% replacement fraction,
the payback period could be as high as 5-6 years. We identify the price of
electricity as the second most important variable, where a price of
US$0.14/kWh, the payback period could go up to 5 years. Electric semi-trucks
are expected to lead to savings due to reduced repairs and magnitude of these
savings could play a crucial role in the payback period as well. With increased
penetration of autonomous vehicles, the annual mileage of semi-trucks could
substantially increase and this heavily sways in favor of electric semi-trucks,
bringing down the payback period to around 2 years at an annual mileage of
120,000 miles. There is an undeniable economic case for electric semi-trucks

alpha)^{-1} \ln{Tr(\hat{rho}^{alpha})} of quantum states for N bosons in the
phase-space representation. With the help of the Bopp rule, we derive the
entropies of Gaussian states in closed form for positive integers alpha =
2,3,4, ... and then, with the help of the analytic continuation, acquire the
closed form also for real values of alpha > 0. The quantity S_2(\hat{rho}),
primarily studied in the literature, will then be a special case of our
finding. Subsequently we acquire the Renyi-alpha entropies, with positive
integers alpha, in closed form also for a specific class of the non-Gaussian
states (mixed states) for N bosons, which may be regarded as a generalization
of the eigenstates |n> (pure states) of a single harmonic oscillator with n >=
1, in which the Wigner functions have negative values indeed. Due to the fact
that the dynamics of a system consisting of $N$ oscillators is Gaussian, our
result will contribute to a systematic study of the Renyi-alpha entropy
dynamics when the current form of a non-Gaussian state is initially prepared.

bipartite ranking problems. However, it is difficult to directly optimizing AUC
as a learning objective, so most existing algorithms are based on optimizing a
surrogate loss to AUC. One significant drawback of these surrogate losses is
that they require pairwise comparisons among training data, which leads to slow
running time and increasing local storage for online learning. In this work, we
describe a new surrogate loss based on a reformulation of the AUC risk, which
does not require pairwise comparison but rankings of the predictions. We
further show that the ranking operation can be avoided, and the learning
objective obtained based on this surrogate enjoys linear complexity in time and
storage. We perform experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the online
and batch algorithms for AUC optimization based on the proposed surrogate loss.

densities of $\sigma \sim 41$ $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Of the 6287 radio sources in

likelihood ratio technique. There are 1110 spectroscopic redshifts and 3648
photometric redshifts available for the counterparts, of which 99.4% exist out
to $z \sim 4$. A number of multiwavelength diagnostics, including X-ray
luminosities, mid-infrared colours, spectral energy distribution fits, radio
luminosities, and optical emission lines and colours, were used to classify the
sources into three types: low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs),
high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs), and star-forming galaxies (SFGs). The
final sample contains 1729 LERGs (36.3%), 1159 radio-loud HERGs (24.4%), 296
radio-quiet HERGs (6.2%), 558 SFGs (11.7%), and 1016 unclassified sources
(21.4%). The LERGs tend to exist in the most massive galaxies with low star
formation rates and redder colours, whereas the HERGs and SFGs exist in
galaxies of lower mass, higher star formation rates, and bluer colours. The
fraction of blue host galaxies is higher for radio-quiet HERGs than for
radio-loud HERGs. LERGs and radio-loud HERGs are found at all radio
luminosities, but radio-loud HERGs tend to be more radio luminous than LERGs at
a given redshift. These results are consistent with the emerging picture in
which LERGs exist in the most massive quiescent galaxies typically found in
clusters with hot X-ray halos and HERGs are associated with ongoing star
formation in their host galaxies via the accretion of cold gas.

under-detection of the camouflaged foreground objects. In this paper, we
present a fusion framework to address this problem in the wavelet domain. We
first show that the small differences in the image domain can be highlighted in
certain wavelet bands. Then the likelihood of each wavelet coefficient being
foreground is estimated by formulating foreground and background models for
each wavelet band. The proposed framework effectively aggregates the
likelihoods from different wavelet bands based on the characteristics of the
wavelet transform. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method
significantly outperformed existing methods in detecting camouflaged foreground

0.87, compared to 0.71 to 0.8 for the other state-of-the-art methods.

precondition then is the constraint corresponding to the complement of that
set, under-approximating the set of safe initial states. This idea of
complementation is not new, but previous attempts to exploit it have suffered
from the loss of precision. Here we develop an iterative specialisation
algorithm to give more precise, and in some cases optimal safety conditions.
The algorithm combines existing transformations, namely constraint
specialisation, partial evaluation and a trace elimination transformation. The

implemented and tested on a benchmark suite of programs from the literature in

large impedance change in the nerve's anisotropic length axis. Approach: Eight
drive and measurement electrode patterns are compared using a finite element
(FE) four cylindrical shell model of a peripheral nerve and a 32 channel
dual-ring nerve cuff. The central layer of the FE model contains impedance
changes representative of neural activity of -0.3 in the length axis and -8.8 x
10-4 in the radial axis. Four of the electrode patterns generate longitudinal
drive current, which runs perpendicular to the anisotropic axis. Main results:
Transverse current patterns produce higher resolution than longitudinal
patterns but are also more susceptible to noise and errors, and exhibit poorer
sensitivity to impedance changes in central sample locations. Three of the four
longitudinal current patterns considered can reconstruct fascicle level
impedance changes with up to 0.2 mV noise and error, which corresponds to
between -5.5 and +0.18 dB of the normalised signal standard deviation. Reducing
the spacing between the two electrode rings in all longitudinal current
patterns reduced the signal to error ratio across all depth locations of the
sample. Significance: Electrode patterns which target the large impedance
change in the anisotropic length axis can provide improved robustness against
noise and errors, which is a critical step towards real time EIT imaging of
neural activity in peripheral nerve.

cracks of finite length is investigated theoretically using the approach based
on the application of Huygens' principle for elastic solids. In the framework
of this approach, the main input information required for calculations of
acoustic emission spectra is the normal displacements of the crack edges as a
function of frequency and wavenumber. Two simple approximate models defining
this function are used in this paper for calculations of the acoustic emission
spectra and directivity functions of a crack of finite length. The simplest
model considers a crack that opens monotonously to its static value. The more
refined model accounts for oscillations during crack opening and considers a
crack of finite size as a resonator for symmetric modes of Rayleigh waves
propagating along the crack edges and partly reflecting from the crack tips.
Analytical solutions for generated acoustic emission spectra are obtained for
both models and compared with each other. It is shown that resonant properties
of a crack are responsible for the appearance of noticeable peaks in the
frequency spectra of generated acoustic emission signals that can be used for
evaluation of crack sizes. The obtained analytical results are illustrated by
numerical calculations.

formation of the Mott insulating state driven by a large spin-orbit coupling.
However, in contrast to the expectation from the Nagaoka Theorem that a single
doped hole or electron destroys the anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) state of the
half-filled Hubbard model in the large U limit, the anti-ferromagnetism
persists in the doped Iridates for a large dopant concentration beyond
half-filling. With a tight-binding description of the relevant J$_{\rm eff}$ =
1/2 states by the third-neighbor ($t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$, $U$) Hubbard model on
the square lattice, we examine the stability of the AFM state to the formation
of a spin spiral state in the strong coupling limit. The third-neighbor
interaction $t_3$ is important for the description of the Fermi surface of the
electron doped system. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained for
the regions of stability of the AFM state. Our results qualitatively explain
the robustness of the AFM state in the electron doped iridate (such as
Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$IrO$_4$), observed in many experiments, where the AFM state
continues to be stable until a critical dopant concentration.

Since the soft staircase function is differentiable and has non-zero gradient
values everywhere, we can exploit backpropagation and a stochastic gradient
descent method to train the feed-forward neural network in the quantizer. The
expected loss regarding the channel input and the decoder output is minimized
in a supervised training phase. The experimental results indicate that the

mostly focus on appearance to synthesize novel views and thus tend to generate

synthesize a novel view. Specifically, we approximate a real-world scene by a
fixed number of planes, and learn to predict a set of homographies and their
corresponding region masks to transform the input image into a novel view. To
this end, we develop a new region-aware geometric transform network that
performs these multiple tasks in a common framework. Our results on the outdoor

fluid solver is based on a second-kind boundary integral formulation of the
Stokes equations that is discretized with a spectrally-accurate Nystrom method
and solved with fast-multipole-accelerated GMRES. The fluid solver provides the
surface shear stress which is used to advance solid boundaries. We regularize
interface evolution via curvature penalization using the $\theta$-$L$
formulation, which affords numerically stable treatment of stiff terms and
therefore permits large time steps. The overall accuracy of our method is
spectral in space and second-order in time. The method is computationally
efficient, with the fluid solver requiring $\mathcal{O}(N)$ operations per
GMRES iteration, a mesh-independent number of GMRES iterations, and a one-time
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ computation to compute the shear stress. We benchmark
single-body results against analytical predictions for the limiting morphology

channels between bodies of close initial proximity. The channelization is

formation models to calculate how the entropy and post-formation luminosity
depend on model properties such as the solid accretion rate and opacity, and
show that the gas accretion rate and its time evolution play a key role in
determining the entropy profile. The predicted luminosity of Jupiter shortly
after formation varies by a factor of $2$--$3$ for different choices of model
parameters. We find that entropy gradients inside Jupiter persist for $\sim 10\
{\rm Myr}$ after formation. We suggest that these gradients should be
considered together with heavy-element composition gradients when modeling
Jupiter's evolution and internal structure.

to a variant of policy iteration with forced exploration, where the policy in

deviation of the voltage profile from 1~p.u. on the entire feeder. A secondary
objective is to reduce the number of tap operations (TOs), which is implemented
for the optimization horizon based on voltage forecasts derived from high
resolution PV generation forecasts. A linearization technique is applied to
make the optimization problem convex and able to be solved at operational
timescales. Simulations on a PC show the solution time for one time step is
only 1.1~s for a large feeder with 4 OLTCs and 1623 buses. OTC results are
compared against existing methods through simulations on two feeders in the
Californian network. OTC is firstly compared against an advanced rule-based
Voltage Level Control (VLC) method. OTC and VLC achieve the same reduction of
voltage violations, but unlike VLC, OTC is capable of coordinating multiple
OLTCs. Scalability to multiple OLTCs is therefore demonstrated against a basic
conventional rule-based control method called Autonomous Tap Control (ATC).
Comparing to ATC, the test feeder under control of OTC can accommodate around
67\% more PV without over-voltage issues. Though a side effect of OTC is an
increase in tap operations, the secondary objective functionally balances
operations between all OLTCs such that impacts on their lifetime and

There are substantial differences at optical and higher energies when these
thermal electrons participate in the afterglow, but early work along these
lines ignored the radio end of the electromagnetic spectrum. We report here on
an extension of previous Monte Carlo simulations of gamma-ray burst afterglows.
The model now includes the synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) process and so can
simulate afterglows across the entire EM spectrum, and several orders of
magnitude in time. In keeping with earlier work, inclusion of the thermal
electrons increases the SSA frequency by a factor of 30, and the radio
intensity by a factor of 100. Furthermore, these changes happen with no
modification to the late optical or X-ray afterglow. Our results provide very
strong evidence that thermal electrons must be considered in any

Inverse and forward uncertainty propagation mechanisms are identified,
projecting uncertainty between observation, control and state variable domains.
Time resolving analysis of uncertainty propagation captures the dynamics of
uncertainty evolution and reveals transient and stationary uncertainty regimes.
The UQ system resolves also the dynamical coupling of uncertainty across
different physical fields, as represented by the off-diagonal posterior
covariance structure. The spatial patterns of posterior uncertainty reduction
and their temporal evolution are explained in terms of barotropic ocean

spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way and designed to deliver chemical
information complementary to a large number of stars covered by the $Gaia$

342,682 stars. For these stars, the GALAH collaboration provides stellar
parameters and abundances for up to 23 elements to the community. Here we
present the target selection, observation, data reduction and detailed
explanation of how the spectra were analysed to estimate stellar parameters and
element abundances. For the stellar analysis, we have used a multi-step
approach. We use the physics-driven spectrum synthesis of Spectroscopy Made
Easy (SME) to derive stellar labels ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log g$,
$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, $\mathrm{[X/Fe]}$, $v_\mathrm{mic}$, $v \sin i$, $A_{K_S}$)
for a representative training set of stars. This information is then propagated
to the whole survey with the data-driven method of $The~Cannon$. Special care
has been exercised in the spectral synthesis to only consider spectral lines
that have reliable atomic input data and are little affected by blending lines.
Departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are considered for
several key elements, including Li, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe, using 1D MARCS
stellar atmosphere models. Validation tests including repeat observations, Gaia
benchmark stars, open and globular clusters, and K2 asteroseismic targets lend
confidence in our methods and results. Combining the GALAH DR2 catalogue with
the kinematic information from $Gaia$ will enable a wide range of Galactic
Archaeology studies, with unprecedented detail, dimensionality, and scope.

Specifically, a sequence of residual CNN units are deployed, whose intermediate

additional four-spin interaction $(Q)$ that favors valence-bond solid order.
For small values of $Q$, the saturation transition is continuous, and is
expected to be governed by zero-scale-factor universality at its upper critical
dimension, with a specific form of logarithmic corrections to scaling (first
proposed by Sachdev \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{50}, 258 (1994)]).
Our results conform to this expectation, but the logarithmic corrections to

that the saturation transition becomes first order above a critical coupling
ratio $(Q/J)_{\rm min}$ and is accompanied by magnetization
jumps---metamagnetism. We obtain an exact solution for $(Q/J)_{\rm min}$ using
a high magnetization expansion, and confirm the existence of the magnetization
jumps beyond this value of coupling using quantum Monte Carlo simulations.

The optical extinction and neutral hydrogen absorption of the GRB host galaxy
are negligible. The fit to the light curve with the standard models shows that
the ambient density is $60\pm 9$ cm$^{-3}$ and the GRB radiating efficiency is
as low as $\sim 0.24\%$, likely indicating a baryonic-dominated ejecta of this

attentions with the availability of large-scale skeleton datasets. The most
crucial factors for this task lie in two aspects: the intra-frame
representation for joint co-occurrences and the inter-frame representation for
skeletons' temporal evolutions. In this paper we propose an end-to-end
convolutional co-occurrence feature learning framework. The co-occurrence
features are learned with a hierarchical methodology, in which different levels
of contextual information are aggregated gradually. Firstly point-level
information of each joint is encoded independently. Then they are assembled
into semantic representation in both spatial and temporal domains.
Specifically, we introduce a global spatial aggregation scheme, which is able
to learn superior joint co-occurrence features over local aggregation. Besides,
raw skeleton coordinates as well as their temporal difference are integrated
with a two-stream paradigm. Experiments show that our approach consistently

without using manually labeled data. Although metadata attached to videos
(e.g., video titles, descriptions) can be of help collecting training data for
the target concept, the collected data is often very noisy. The main challenge
is therefore how to select good examples from noisy training data. Previous
approaches firstly learn easy examples that are unlikely to be noise and then
gradually learn more complex examples. However, hard examples that are much
different from easy ones are never learned. In this paper, we propose an
approach called multimodal co-training (MMCo) for selecting good examples from
noisy training data. MMCo jointly learns classifiers for multiple modalities
that complement each other to select good examples. Since MMCo selects examples
by consensus of multimodal classifiers, a hard example for one modality can

reddening SDSS/APOGEE-DR14 red giants, and this database served for an
empirical effective temperature- and metallicity-dependent photometric

combined with Gaia G-band empirical extinction coefficients recently published,
G, J and Ks photometry and APOGEE atmospheric parameters to derive the
extinction of a large fraction of the survey targets. Distances were estimated
independently using isochrones and the magnitude-independent extinction
K(J-Ks). This new dataset has been merged with the one used for the earlier
version of dust map. A new Bayesian inversion of distance-extinction pairs has
been performed to produce an updated 3D map. We present several properties of
the new map. Its comparison with 2D dust emission reveals that all large dust
shells seen in emission at mid- and high-latitude are closer than 300pc. The
updated distribution constrains the well debated, X-ray bright North Polar Spur

days since the explosion, indicating that this SN takes one of the longest time
to finish the plateau phase. among Type IIP SNe (SNe IIP), including
low-luminosity (LL) SNe IIP. The line velocities of various ions at the middle
of the plateau phase are as low as 1,000--1,500 km s$^{-1}$, which is the
lowest even among LL SNe IIP. These measurements imply that the ejecta mass in
SN 2016bkv is larger than that of the well-studied LL IIP SN 2003Z. In the
early phase, SN 2016bkv shows a strong bump in the light curve. In addition,
the optical spectra in this bump phase exhibit a blue continuum accompanied
with a narrow H$\alpha$ emission line. These features indicate an interaction
between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar matter (CSM) as in SNe IIn.
Assuming the ejecta-CSM interaction scenario, the mass loss rate is estimated
to be $\sim 1.7 \times 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ within a few years before
the SN explosion. This is comparable to or even larger than the largest mass
loss rate observed for the Galactic red supergiants ($\sim 10^{-3} M_{\odot}$

experienced a violent mass loss just before the SN explosion.

features of smart grids that already include the control technologies necessary

mathematical formulation is presented for the reconfiguration problem reducing
the number of required binary variables while covering more practical scenarios

the network reconfiguration are the nodal load rejection, the tap setting
modification of voltage regulation devices (incl. OLTCs, SVR, and CBs), and the
active or reactive power dispatch of DGs. The voltage dependency of loads is
also considered. Thus, the proposed optimization problem determines the most
efficient restoration plan minimizing the number of deenergized nodes with the
minimum number of self healing actions. The problem is formulated as a Mixed
Integer Second Order Cone Programming (MISOCP) and solved using the Gurobi
solver via the MATLAB interface YALMIP. A real 83 node distribution network is

Perron-Frobenius theory, whereby the Perron-Frobenius vector field which shapes

four different deep learning networks: convolutional neural networks with and
without consideration of conservation laws, generative adversarial networks
with and without consideration of conservation laws. Flow fields at future
occasions are predicted based on information of flow fields at previous
occasions. Deep learning networks are trained first using flow fields at
Reynolds numbers of 100, 200, 300, and 400, while flow fields at Reynolds
numbers of 500 and 3000 are predicted using the trained deep learning networks.
Physical loss functions are proposed to explicitly impose information of
conservation of mass and momentum to deep learning networks. An adversarial
training is applied to extract features of flow dynamics in an unsupervised
manner. Effects of the proposed physical loss functions, adversarial training,
and network sizes on the prediction accuracy are analyzed. Predicted flow
fields using deep learning networks are in favorable agreement with flow fields
computed by numerical simulations.

for style. The proposed framework can map cross-domain data to a latent code
vector consisting of a content part and a style part. The latent code vector is
matched with a prior distribution so that we can generate meaningful samples
from any part of the prior space. Consequently, given a sample of one domain,
our framework can generate various samples of the other domain with the same
content of the input. This makes the proposed framework different from the
current work of cross-domain transformation. Besides, the proposed framework
can be trained with both labeled and unlabeled data, which makes it also
suitable for domain adaptation. Experimental results on data sets SVHN, MNIST

MF$_{\text{ar}}$ are positively correlated with TSI, while MF$_2$ is negatively
correlated with TSI; the correlations between MF$_1$, MF$_3$ and TSI are
insignificant. The bootstrapping tests confirm that the impact of MF$_4$ on TSI

MF$_{\text{ar}}$ leads TSI by one rotational period. By extracting the

not expected to be accompanied by any electro-magnetic event that may help in
accessing their redshifts. We address this deficiency by using an optical
catalog to get the distribution of galaxies in redshift. Assuming that the
clustering of the binaries is correlated with that of the galaxies, we propose
using that correlation to measure $H_0$. We show that employing this method on
simulated data obtained for second-generation networks comprising at least
three detectors, e.g., advanced LIGO - advanced VIRGO network, one can measure
$H_0$ with an accuracy of $\sim$8% with detection of a reference population of
25 binaries, each with black holes of mass 10$M_\odot$. As expected, with
third-generation detectors like the Einstein telescope (ET), which will measure
distances much more accurately and to greater depths, one can obtain better
estimates for $H_0$. Specifically, we show that with 25 observations, ET can
constrain $H_0$ to an accuracy of $\sim$7%. This method can also be used to
estimate other cosmological parameters like the matter density $\Omega_m$ and

electronic states seen in magic-angle graphene superlattices. From the Hubbard
model on a double-layer honeycomb lattice with a rotation angle
$\theta=1.08^{\circ}$, we reveal that an antiferromagnetically ordered Mott
insulator emerges beyond a critical $U_c$ at half filling, and with a small
doping, the pairing with $d+id$ symmetry dominates over other pairings at low
temperature. The effective $d+id$ pairing interaction strongly increase as the
on-site Coulomb interaction increases, indicating that the superconductivity is
driven by electron-electron correlation. Our non-biased numerical results
demonstrate that the twisted bilayer graphene share the similar superconducting
mechanism of high temperature superconductors, which is a new and idea platform
for further investigating the strongly correlated phenomena.

fuel-optimal impulsive control input sequences that drive a linear time-variant
system to a desired state at a specified time. This algorithm is applicable to
a broad class of problems where the cost is expressed as a time-varying
norm-like function of the control input, enabling inclusion of complex
operational constraints in the control planning problem. First, it is shown
that the reachable sets for this problem have identical properties to those in
prior works using constant cost functions, enabling use of existing algorithms
in conjunction with newly derived contact and support functions. By
reformulating the optimal control problem as a semi-infinite convex program, it
is also demonstrated that the time-invariant component of the commonly studied
primer vector is an outward normal vector to the reachable set at the target
state. Using this formulation, a fast and robust algorithm that provides
globally optimal impulsive control input sequences is proposed. The algorithm
iteratively refines estimates of an outward normal vector to the reachable set
at the target state and a minimal set of control input times until the
optimality criteria are satisfied to within a user-specified tolerance. Next,
optimal control inputs are computed by solving a quadratic program. The
algorithm is validated through simulations of challenging example problems
based on the recently proposed Miniaturized Distributed Occulter/Telescope

converges several times faster than comparable algorithms in literature.

external chemical gradients, a process known as chemotaxis which has been
studied here using the chiral squirmer model. This theoretical model considers
the microorganism as a spherical body with an active surface slip velocity. In
presence of a chemical gradient, the internal signaling network of the
microorganism is triggered due to binding of the ligand with the receptors on
the surface of the body. Consequently, the coefficients of the slip velocity
get modified resulting in a change in the path followed by the body. We observe
that the strength of the gradient is not the only parameter which controls the
dynamics of the body but also the adaptation time play a very significant role
in the success of chemotaxis of the body. Path of the body is smooth if we
ignore the discreteness in the ligand-receptor binding which is stochastic in
nature. In presence of the later, the path is not only irregular but the
dynamics of the body changes. We calculate the mean first passage time, by
varying strength of the chemical gradient and adaptation time, to investigate
the success rate of chemotaxis.

search for efficient means of testing the correctness of these quantum

quantum computation within the framework of interactive proofs has been
fruitful for addressing this problem. Specifically, an untrusted agent (prover)
alleging to perform quantum computations can have his claims verified by
another agent (verifier) who only has access to classical computation and a
small quantum device for preparing or measuring single qubits. However, when
this quantum device is prone to errors, verification becomes challenging and
often existing protocols address this by adding extra assumptions, such as
requiring the noise in the device to be uncorrelated with the noise on the
prover's devices. In this paper, we present a simple protocol for verifying
quantum computations, in the presence of noisy devices, with no extra
assumptions. This protocol is based on post hoc techniques for verification,
which allow for the prover to know the desired quantum computation and its
input. We also perform a simulation of the protocol, for a one-qubit
computation, and find the error thresholds when using the qubit repetition code
as well as the Steane code.

system hosts antiferromagnetic (AFM) and columnar valence-bond-solid (VBS)
ground states. The VBS breaks $Z_4$ symmetry, and in the presence of
arbitrarily weak disorder it forms domains. Using QMC simulations, we
demonstrate two kinds of such disordered VBS states. Upon dilution, a removed
site leaves a localized spin in the opposite sublattice. These spins form AFM
order. For random interactions, we find a different state, with no order but
algebraically decaying mean correlations. We identify localized spinons at the
nexus of domain walls between different VBS patterns. These spinons form
correlated groups with the same number of spinons and antispinons. Within such
a group, there is a strong tendency to singlet formation, because of
spinon-spinon interactions mediated by the domain walls. Thus, no long-range
AFM order forms. We propose that this state is a 2D analog of the well-known 1D
random singlet (RS) state, though the dynamic exponent $z$ in 2D is finite. By
studying the T-dependent magnetic susceptibility, we find that $z$ varies, from
$z=2$ at the AFM--RS phase boundary and larger in the RS phase The RS state
discovered here in a system without geometric frustration should correspond to
the same fixed point as the RS state recently proposed for frustrated systems,
and the ability to study it without Monte Carlo sign problems opens up
opportunities for further detailed characterization of its static and dynamic
properties. We also discuss experimental evidence of the RS phase in the

harboring a supermassive black hole (SMBH), a leading scenario for the
formation of nuclear star clusters. We consider the case of GCs containing
either an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a population of stellar mass
black holes (BHs), and study the formation of gravitational wave (GW) sources.
We perform direct summation $N$-body simulations of the infall of GCs with
different orbital eccentricities in the live background of a galaxy with either
a shallow or steep density profile. We find that the GC acts as an efficient
carrier for the IMBH, facilitating the formation of a bound pair. The hardening
and evolution of the binary depends sensitively on the galaxy's density
profile. If the host galaxy has a shallow profile the hardening is too slow to
allow for coalescence within a Hubble time, unless the initial cluster orbit is
highly eccentric. If the galaxy hosts a nuclear star cluster, the hardening
leads to coalescence by emission of GWs within $3-4$ Gyr. In this case, we find
a IMBH-SMBH merger rate of $\Gamma_{\rm IMBH-SMBH} = 2.8\times 10^{-3}$
yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$. If the GC hosts a population of stellar BHs, these are
deposited close enough to the SMBH to form extreme-mass-ratio-inspirals with a
merger rate of $\Gamma_{\rm EMRI} = 0.25$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$. Finally, the
SMBH tidal field can boost the coalescence of stellar black hole binaries
delivered from the infalling GCs. The merger rate for this merging channel is
$\Gamma_{\rm BHB} = 0.4-4$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$.

profiles to the power spectra of Sun-like stars. However the line profiles of
solar oscillations have been observed to be asymmetrical for the Sun. The
physical origin of this line asymmetry is not fully understood, although it
should depend on the depth dependence of the source of wave excitation
(convective turbulence) and details of the observable (velocity or intensity).
For oscillations of the Sun, it has been shown that neglecting the asymmetry
leads to systematic errors in the frequency determination. This could
subsequently affects the results of seismic inferences of the solar internal
structure. Using light curves from the {\it Kepler} spacecraft we have measured
mode asymmetries in 43 stars. We confirm that neglecting the asymmetry leads to
systematic errors that can exceed the $1\sigma$ confidence intervals for
seismic observations longer than one year. Therefore, the application of an
asymmetric Lorentzian profile is to be favoured to improve the accuracy of the
internal stellar structure and stellar fundamental parameters. We also show
that the asymmetry changes sign between cool Sun-like stars and hotter stars.
This provides the best constraints to date on the location of the excitation
sources across the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram.

assumption of the paired fermion (LPs) formation in the cuprate high-$T_c$
superconductors (cuprates) below the representative temperature $T^*\gg T_c$
resulting in the PG opening. Within the model, the temperature dependencies of
the PG, $\Delta^*(T)$, for the samples with different number of the PrBCO
layers ($N_{Pr}$) were analyzed in the whole temperature range from $T^*$ down
to $T_c$. Near $T_c$, excess conductivity was found to be perfectly described
by the Aslamasov-Larkin and Hikami-Larkin (Maki-Thompson term) fluctuation
theories, suggesting the presence of superconducting fluctuations in a
relatively large (up to 15 K) temperature range above $T_c$. All sample
parameters were found to change with increase of $N_{Pr}$, finally resulting in
the appearance of the pronounced maximum of $\Delta^*(T)$ at high temperatures.
The result is most likely due to increasing influence of the intrinsic
magnetism of PrBCO ($\mu_{Pr}\approx 4\,\mu_B$) and suggests the possibility to
search in that way the change of interplay between the superconductivity and

communication via diffusion (MCvD). Symbol synchronization among chemical
sensors and nanomachines is one of the critical challenges to manage complex
tasks in the nanonetworks with molecular communication (MC). As in
diffusion-based MC, most of the molecules arrive at the receptor closer to the
start of the symbol duration, the wrong estimation of the start of the symbol
interval leads to a high symbol detection error. By utilizing two types of
molecules with different diffusion coefficients we propose a synchronization
technique for MCvD. Moreover, we evaluate the symbol-error-rate performance
under the proposed symbol synchronization scheme for equal and non-equal symbol
duration in MCvD systems.

communication show that equipping base stations (BSs) with large arrays of
antenna can significantly improve the performance of cellular networks. Massive
MIMO has the potential to mitigate the interference in the network and enhance
the average throughput per user. On the other hand, dynamic time division
duplexing (TDD), which allows neighboring cells to operate with different
uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) sub-frame configurations, is a promising
enhancement for the conventional static TDD. Compared with static TDD, dynamic
TDD can offer more flexibility to accommodate various UL and DL traffic
patterns across different cells, but may result in additional interference
among cells transmitting in different directions. Based on the unique
characteristics and properties of massive MIMO and dynamic TDD, we propose a
marriage of these two techniques, i.e., to have massive MIMO address the
limitation of dynamic TDD in macro cell (MC) networks. Specifically, we
advocate that the benefits of dynamic TDD can be fully extracted in MC networks
equipped with massive MIMO, i.e., the BS-to-BS interference can be effectively
removed by increasing the number of BS antennas. We provide detailed analysis
using random matrix theory to show that the effect of the BS-to-BS interference
on uplink transmissions vanishes as the number of BS antennas per-user grows
infinitely large. Last but not least, we validate our analysis by numerical
simulations.

electron transport, the electron drift instability (EDI), and secondary

operated separately with four different noble gases: xenon, krypton, argon, and
helium. Models for electron induced secondary electron emission (SEE) and
dielectric walls are implemented in order to investigate the coupling between
the propellant choice and the radial thruster walls. For all conditions and
propellants studied, an EDI and enhanced electron cross-field transport are
observed. The frequency of the instability, as well as the electron mobility,
are compared with analytical expressions from a recently developed kinetic

renewed interest in searching for short-duration radio transients. This event
is now considered to be the first established Fast Radio Burst (FRB), which is
a class of millisecond-duration radio transients. The large dispersive delays
observed in FRBs distinguish them from the individual bright pulses from
Galactic pulsars, and suggests that they originate deep in extragalactic space.
Amazingly, FRBs are not rare: the implied event rate ranges up to many
thousands of events per sky, per day. The fact that only two dozen FRBs have
been discovered to date is a consequence of the limited sensitivity and field
of view of current radio telescopes. The precise localization of FRB 121102,
the first and currently only FRB observed to repeat, has led to the unambiguous
identification of its host galaxy and thus proven its extragalactic origin and
large energy scale. It remains unclear, however, whether all FRBs are capable
of repeating (many appear far less active) or whether FRB 121102 implies that
there are multiple sub-classes. Regardless, the repetitive nature of FRB 121102
and its localization to within a star-forming region in the host galaxy imply
that the bursts might originate from an exceptionally powerful neutron star -
one necessarily quite unlike any we have observed in the Milky Way. In these
proceedings, I give a very brief introduction to the FRB phenomenon and focus
primarily on the insights that FRB 121102 has provided thus far.

link between the asteroid and the howardite-eucrite-diogenite family of

constraint for the study of the early evolution of the Solar System. Some
results of the Dawn mission, however, cast doubts on our understanding of
Vesta's interior composition and of the characteristics of its basaltic crust,
weakening this classical constraint. In this work we investigate the late
accretion and erosion experienced by Vesta's crust after its differentiation
and recorded in the composition of eucrites and diogenites and show that it
offers an astrochemical window into the earliest evolution of the Solar System.
In our proof-of-concept case study focusing on the late accretion and erosion
of Vesta's crust during the growth and migration of Jupiter, the water
enrichment of eucrites appears to be a sensitive function of Jupiter's
migration while the enrichment in highly-siderophile elements of diogenites
appears to be particularly sensitive to the size-frequency distribution of the
planetesimals. The picture depicted by the enrichments created by late
accretion in eucrites and diogenites is not qualitatively affected by the
uncertainty on the primordial mass of Vesta. Crustal erosion, instead, is more
significantly affected by said uncertainty and Vesta's crust survival appears
to be mainly useful to study violent collisional scenarios where highly
energetic impacts can strip significant amounts of vestan material while
limitedly contributing to Vesta's late accretion. Our results suggest that the
astrochemical record of the late accretion and erosion of Vesta's crust
provided by eucrites and diogenites can be used as a tool to investigate any
process or scenario associated to the evolution of primordial Vesta and of the
early Solar System.

  Memory Storage Capacity","13 pages, 2 figures",,,,"hep-th cond-mat.dis-nn quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classicalization is a phenomenon of redistribution of energy - initially
stored in few hard quanta - into the high occupation numbers of the soft modes,
described by a final state that is approximately classical. Using an effective
Hamiltonian, we first show why the transition amplitudes that increase
occupation numbers are exponentially suppressed and how a very special family
of classicalizing theories compensates this suppression. This is thanks to a
large micro-state entropy generated by the emergent gapless modes around the
final classical state. The dressing of the process by the super-soft quanta of
these modes compensates the exponential suppression of the transition
probability. Hence, an unsuppressed classicalization takes place exclusively
into the states of exponentially enhanced memory storage capacity. Next, we
describe this phenomenon in the language of a quantum neural network, in which
the neurons are represented as interconnected quantum modes with gravity-like
negative-energy synaptic connections. We show that upon an injection of energy
in form of a hard quantum stimulus, the network reaches the classicalized state
of exponentially enhanced memory capacity with order one probability. We
construct a simple model in which the transition results into classical states
that carry an area-law micro-state entropy. In this language, a non-Wilsonian
UV-completion of the Standard Model via classicalization implies that above
cutoff energy the theory operates as a brain network that softens the high
energy quanta by bringing itself into the state of a maximal memory capacity. A
similar interpretation applies to black hole formation in particle collision.

that when the trap frequencies of the two lattice directions are equal, the
trap frequencies of the combined potential exhibit an avoided crossing and the
corresponding eigenmodes are rotated by 45 degrees relative to the lattice
beams. Hence, tuning the trap frequencies makes it possible to rotate the
eigenmodes such that both eigenmodes have a large projection onto any desired
direction in the lattice plane, in particular, onto the direction along which
Raman cooling works. Using this, we achieve two-dimensional Raman ground-state
cooling in a geometry where this would be impossible, if the eigenmodes were
not rotated. Our experiment is performed with a single atom inside an optical

modelled by the aerosol-climate model CAM5.3-MARC-ARG. CAM5.3-MARC-ARG is a new
configuration of the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.3 (CAM5.3) in which
the default aerosol module has been replaced by the two-Moment, Multi-Modal,
Mixing-state-resolving Aerosol model for Research of Climate (MARC).
CAM5.3-MARC-ARG uses the default ARG aerosol activation scheme, consistent with
the default configuration of CAM5.3. We compute differences between simulations
using year-1850 aerosol emissions and simulations using year-2000 aerosol
emissions in order to assess the radiative effects of anthropogenic aerosols.
We compare the aerosol column burdens, cloud properties, and radiative effects
produced by CAM5.3-MARC-ARG with those produced by the default configuration of
CAM5.3, which uses the modal aerosol module with three log-normal modes (MAM3).
Compared with MAM3, we find that MARC produces stronger cooling via the direct
radiative effect, stronger cooling via the surface albedo radiative effect, and
stronger warming via the cloud longwave radiative effect. The global mean cloud
shortwave radiative effect is similar between MARC and MAM3, although the
regional distributions differ. Overall, MARC produces a global mean net ERF of
-1.75$\pm$0.04 W m$^{-2}$, which is stronger than the global mean net ERF of
-1.57$\pm$0.04 W m$^{-2}$ produced by MAM3. The regional distribution of ERF
also differs between MARC and MAM3, largely due to differences in the regional
distribution of the cloud shortwave radiative effect. We conclude that the
specific representation of aerosols in global climate models, including aerosol
mixing state, has important implications for climate modelling.

the performance of the systems where speech utterances need to be extracted
from the speech signal such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system.
Existing endpoint detection (EPD) methods mostly uses Short-Term Energy (STE),
Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) based approaches and their variants. But STE and ZCR
based EPD algorithms often fail in the presence of Non-speech Sound Artifacts
(NSAs) produced by the speakers. Algorithms based on pattern recognition and
classification techniques are also proposed but require labeled data for
training. A new algorithm termed as Wavelet Convolution based Speech Endpoint
Detection (WCSEPD) is proposed in this article to extract speech endpoints.
WCSEPD decomposes the speech signal into high-frequency and low-frequency
components using wavelet convolution and computes entropy based thresholds for
the two frequency components. The low-frequency thresholds are used to extract
voiced speech segments, whereas the high-frequency thresholds are used to
extract the unvoiced speech segments by filtering out the NSAs. WCSEPD does not
require any labeled data for training and can automatically extract speech
segments. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm precisely
extracts speech endpoints in the presence of NSAs.

  Engine Airpath","16 pages, 15 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A significant challenge in the development of control systems for diesel
airpath applications is to tune the controller parameters to achieve
satisfactory output performance, especially whilst adhering to input and safety
constraints in the presence of unknown system disturbances. Model-based control
techniques, such as model predictive control (MPC), have been successfully
applied to multivariable and highly nonlinear systems, such as diesel engines,
while considering operational constraints. However, efficient calibration of
typical implementations of MPC is hindered by the high number of tuning
parameters and their non-intuitive correlation with the output response. In
this paper, the number of effective tuning parameters is reduced through
suitable structural modifications to the controller formulation and an
appropriate redesign of the MPC cost function to aid rapid calibration.
Furthermore, a constraint tightening-like approach is augmented to the control
architecture to provide robustness guarantees in the face of uncertainties. A
switched linear time-varying MPC strategy with recursive feasibility guarantees
during controller switching is proposed to handle transient operation of the
engine. The robust controller is first implemented on a high fidelity
simulation environment, with a comprehensive investigation of its calibration
to achieve desired transient response under step changes in the fuelling rate.
An experimental study then validates and highlights the performance of the
proposed controller architecture for selected tunings of the calibration
parameters for fuelling steps and over drive cycles.

interest. These extensions include parity games with energy and payoff
conditions as well as finitary parity games and their generalization to parity

extensions, as they offer a native combination of the qualitative and
quantitative aspects in infinite games: The quantitative aspect of finitary
parity games is a quality measure for the qualitative aspect, as it measures
the limit superior of the time it takes to answer an odd color by a larger even
one. Finitary parity games have been extended to parity games with costs, where
each transition is labeled with a nonnegative weight that reflects the costs
incurred by taking it. We lift this restriction and consider parity games with
costs with arbitrary integer weights.
  We show that solving such games is in NP $\cap$ coNP, the signature
complexity for games of this type. We also show that the protagonist has
finite-state winning strategies, and provide tight pseudo-polynomial bounds for
the memory he needs to win the game. Naturally, the antagonist may need
infinite memory to win. Moreover, we present tight bounds on the quality of
winning strategies for the protagonist.
  Furthermore, we investigate the problem of determining, for a given threshold
$b$, whether the protagonist has a strategy of quality at most $b$ and show
this problem to be EXPTIME-complete. The protagonist inherits the necessity of
exponential memory for implementing such strategies from the special case of
finitary parity games.

  We provide a rigorous runtime analysis of a simple memetic algorithm, the
$(1+1)$ MA, on the Hurdle problem class, a landscape class of tuneable
difficulty that shows a ""big valley structure"", a characteristic feature of
many hard problems from combinatorial optimisation. The only parameter of this
class is the hurdle width w, which describes the length of fitness valleys that
have to be overcome. We show that the $(1+1)$ EA requires $\Theta(n^w)$
expected function evaluations to find the optimum, whereas the $(1+1)$ MA with
best-improvement and first-improvement local search can find the optimum in
$\Theta(n^2+n^3/w^2)$ and $\Theta(n^3/w^2)$ function evaluations, respectively.
Surprisingly, while increasing the hurdle width makes the problem harder for
evolutionary algorithms, the problem becomes easier for memetic algorithms. We
discuss how these findings can explain and illustrate the success of memetic
algorithms for problems with big valley structures.

dimensional variation (WC-4DVar) in particular, are important in the
geosciences but also in other communities (often under different names). The
cost functions and the resulting optimal trajectories may have a probabilistic
interpretation, for instance by linking data assimilation with Maximum
Aposteriori (MAP) estimation. This is possible in particular if the unknown
trajectory is modelled as the solution of a stochastic differential equation
(SDE), as is increasingly the case in weather forecasting and climate
modelling. In this case, the MAP estimator (or ""most probable path"" of the SDE)
is obtained by minimising the Onsager--Machlup functional. Although this fact
is well known, there seems to be some confusion in the literature, with the
energy (or ""least squares"") functional sometimes been claimed to yield the most
probable path. The first aim of this paper is to address this confusion and
show that the energy functional does not, in general, provide the most probable
path. The second aim is to discuss the implications in practice. Although the
mentioned results pertain to stochastic models in continuous time, they do have
consequences in practice where SDE's are approximated by discrete time schemes.
It turns out that using an approximation to the SDE and calculating its most
probable path does not necessarily yield a good approximation to the most
probable path of the SDE proper. This suggest that even in discrete time, a
version of the Onsager--Machlup functional should be used, rather than the
energy functional, at least if the solution is to be interpreted as a MAP
estimator.

systems can produce. The orbital and basic physical data we currently possess
for the bulk of the exoplanetary population, however, do not provide enough
information to break the intrinsic degeneracy of their histories, as different
evolutionary tracks can result in the same final configurations. The lessons
learned from the Solar System indicate us that the solution to this problem
lies in the information contained in the composition of planets. The goal of
the Atmospheric Remote-Sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey (ARIEL), one of
the three candidates as ESA M4 space mission, is to observe a large and
diversified population of transiting planets around a range of host star types
to collect information on their atmospheric composition. ARIEL will focus on
warm and hot planets to take advantage of their well-mixed atmospheres, which
should show minimal condensation and sequestration of high-Z materials and thus
reveal their bulk composition across all main cosmochemical elements. In this
work we will review the most outstanding open questions concerning the way
planets form and the mechanisms that contribute to create habitable
environments that the compositional information gathered by ARIEL will allow to

problems in graph signal processing. While in classical signal processing
sampling is a well defined operation, when we consider a graph signal many new
challenges arise and defining an efficient sampling strategy is not
straightforward. Recently, several works have addressed this problem. The most
common techniques select a subset of nodes to reconstruct the entire signal.
However, such methods often require the knowledge of the signal support and the
computation of the sparsity basis before sampling. Instead, in this paper we
propose a new approach to this issue. We introduce a novel technique that
combines localized sampling with compressed sensing. We first choose a subset
of nodes and then, for each node of the subset, we compute random linear
combinations of signal coefficients localized at the node itself and its
neighborhood. The proposed method provides theoretical guarantees in terms of
reconstruction and stability to noise for any graph and any orthonormal basis,
even when the support is not known.

a martensitic transformation at temperature $T_M$ and ferromagnetic ordering at
temperature $T_C$, while the pure end member ($x=0$) also has a premartensitic
transition at $T_{PM}$, giving four different scenarios: $T_C>T_{PM}>T_M$,
$T_C>T_M$ without premartensitic transition, $T_C\approx T_M$, and $T_C<T_M$.
Fundamental differences in elastic properties i.e., stiffening versus
softening, are explained in terms of coupling of shear strains with three
discrete order parameters relating to magnetic ordering, a soft mode and the
electronic instability responsible for the large strains typical of martensitic
transitions. Linear-quadratic or biquadratic coupling between these order
parameters, either directly or indirectly via the common strains, is then used
to explain the stabilities of the different structures. Acoustic losses are
attributed to critical slowing down at the premartensite transition, to the
mobility of interphases between coexisting phases at the martensitic transition
and to mobility of some aspect of the twin walls under applied stress down to
the lowest temperatures at which measurements were made.

that the separable states coincide with the Perelomov coherent states
associated with the generalized Weyl-Heisenberg algebra considered in this
paper. In the so-called Majorana scheme, the qudit (d-level) states are
represented by N points on the Bloch sphere; roughly speaking, it can be said
that a qudit (in a d-dimensional space) is describable by a N-qubit vector (in
a N-dimensional space). In such a scheme, the permanent of the matrix
describing the overlap between the N qubits makes it possible to measure the
entanglement between the N qubits forming the qudit. This is confirmed by a
Fubini-Study metric analysis. A new parameter, proportional to the permanent
and called perma-concurrence, is introduced for characterizing the entanglement
of a symmetric qudit arising from N qubits. For d=3 (i.e., N = 2), this
parameter constitutes an alternative to the concurrence for two qubits. Other

either Statistical MT (SMT) or Neural MT (NMT) -- is the availability of
high-quality parallel data. This is arguably more important today than ever
before, as NMT has been shown in many studies to outperform SMT, but mostly
when large parallel corpora are available; in cases where data is limited, SMT
can still outperform NMT.
  Recently researchers have shown that back-translating monolingual data can be
used to create synthetic parallel corpora, which in turn can be used in
combination with authentic parallel data to train a high-quality NMT system.
Given that large collections of new parallel text become available only quite
rarely, backtranslation has become the norm when building state-of-the-art NMT
systems, especially in resource-poor scenarios.
  However, we assert that there are many unknown factors regarding the actual
effects of back-translated data on the translation capabilities of an NMT
model. Accordingly, in this work we investigate how using back-translated data
as a training corpus -- both as a separate standalone dataset as well as
combined with human-generated parallel data -- affects the performance of an
NMT model. We use incrementally larger amounts of back-translated data to train
a range of NMT systems for German-to-English, and analyse the resulting
translation performance.

further generalized to a twisted link. Twisted links are in one-to-one
correspondence with stable equivalence classes of links in oriented thickenings
of (possibly non-orientable) closed surfaces. By definition, equivalent virtual
links are also equivalent as twisted links. In this paper, we discuss when two
virtual links are equivalent as twisted links, and give a necessary and

barred galaxy model, in which the three-dimensional (3D) family, bifurcating
from x1 at the 2:1 vertical resonance with the known ""frown-smile"" side-on
morphology, is unstable. Our goal is to study the differences that occur in the
phase space structure at the vertical 2:1 resonance region in this case, with
respect to the known, well studied, standard case, in which the families with
the frown-smile profiles are stable and support an X-shaped morphology. The
potential used in the study originates in a frozen snapshot of an $N$-body
simulation in which a fast bar has evolved. We follow the evolution of the
vertical stability of the central family of periodic orbits as a function of
the energy (Jacobi constant) and we investigate the phase space content by
means of spaces of section. The two bifurcating families at the vertical 2:1
resonance region of the new model change their stability with respect to that
of most studied analytic potentials. The structure in the side-on view that is
directly supported by the trapping of quasi-periodic orbits around 3D stable
periodic orbits has now an infinity symbol (i.e. $\infty$-type) profile.
However, the available sticky orbits can reinforce other types of side-on
morphologies as well. In the new model, the dynamical mechanism of trapping
quasi-periodic orbits around the 3D stable periodic orbits that build the
peanut, supports the $\infty$-type profile. The same mechanism in the standard
case supports the X shape with the frown-smile orbits. Nevertheless, in both
cases (i.e. in the new and in the standard model) a combination of 3D
quasi-periodic orbits around the stable x1 family with sticky orbits can
support a profile reminiscent of the shape of the orbits of the 3D unstable
family existing in each model.

problems. They reduce the risk of having underperforming models in
production-grade software. Although critical, methods for learning
heterogeneous regression ensembles have not been proposed at large scale,
whereas in classical ML literature, stacking, cascading and voting are mostly
restricted to classification problems. Regression poses distinct learning
challenges that may result in poor performance, even when using well
established homogeneous ensemble schemas such as bagging or boosting.
  In this paper, we introduce MetaBags, a novel, practically useful stacking
framework for regression. MetaBags is a meta-learning algorithm that learns a
set of meta-decision trees designed to select one base model (i.e. expert) for
each query, and focuses on inductive bias reduction. A set of meta-decision
trees are learned using different types of meta-features, specially created for
this purpose - to then be bagged at meta-level. This procedure is designed to
learn a model with a fair bias-variance trade-off, and its improvement over
base model performance is correlated with the prediction diversity of different
experts on specific input space subregions. The proposed method and
meta-features are designed in such a way that they enable good predictive
performance even in subregions of space which are not adequately represented in
the available training data.
  An exhaustive empirical testing of the method was performed, evaluating both
generalization error and scalability of the approach on synthetic, open and
real-world application datasets. The obtained results show that our method
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

sample, including correlations between coordinates. Additionally, we often have
missing data case: that data points can miss values for some of coordinates.
This article adapts rapid parametric density estimation approach for this
purpose: modelling density as a linear combination of orthonormal functions,
for which $L^2$ optimization says that (independently) estimated coefficient
for a given function is just average over the sample of value of this function.
Hierarchical correlation reconstruction first models probability density for
each separate coordinate using all its appearances in data sample, then adds
corrections from independently modelled pairwise correlations using all samples
having both coordinates, and so on independently adding correlations for
growing numbers of variables using often decreasing evidence in data sample. A
basic application of such modelled multidimensional density can be imputation
of missing coordinates: by inserting known coordinates to the density, and
taking expected values for the missing coordinates, or even their entire joint
probability distribution. Presented method can be compared with cascade
correlations approach, offering several advantages in flexibility and accuracy.

$d^{-1}\mathcal{X}_{n,d}\mathcal{X}_{n,d}^T$, associated with a rectangular
random matrix $\mathcal{X}_{n,d}$ of size $n\times d$ whose entries are jointly
Gaussian and correlated. Even if we will consider the case of overall
correlation among the entries of $\mathcal{X}_{n,d}$, our main focus is on the
case where the rows of $\mathcal{X}_{n,d}$ are independent copies of a
$n$-dimensional stationary centered Gaussian vector of correlation function
$s$. When $s$ belongs to $\ell^{4/3}(\mathbb{Z})$, we show that a proper
normalization of $d^{-1}\mathcal{X}_{n,d}\mathcal{X}_{n,d}^T$ is close in
Wasserstein distance to the corresponding Gaussian ensemble as long as $d$ is
much larger than $n^3$, thus recovering the main finding of [3,9] and extending
it to a larger class of matrices. We also investigate the case where $s$ is the
correlation function associated with the fractional Brownian noise of parameter
$H$. This example is very rich, as it gives rise to a great variety of
phenomena with very different natures, depending on how $H$ is located with
respect to $1/2$, $5/8$ and $3/4$. Notably, when $H>3/4$, our study highlights
a new probabilistic object, which we have decided to call the
Rosenblatt-Wishart matrix. Our approach crucially relies on the fact that the
entries of the Wishart matrices we are dealing with are double Wiener-It\^o
integrals, allowing us to make use of multivariate bounds arising from the
Malliavin-Stein method and related ideas. To conclude the paper, we analyze the
situation where the row-independence assumption is relaxed and we also look at
the setting of random $p$-tensors ($p\geq 3$), a natural extension of Wishart
matrices.

promise in speeding up this process, but they lag behind human classification
accuracy by about 5%. We explore whether more recently available document
classification algorithms can close this gap. We applied 8 supervised learning
algorithms to predict whether children meet the case definition for ASD based
solely on the words in their evaluations. We compared the algorithms'
performance across 10 random train-test splits of the data, using
classification accuracy, F1 score, and number of positive calls to evaluate
their potential use for surveillance. Across the 10 train-test cycles, the
random forest and support vector machine with Naive Bayes features (NB-SVM)
each achieved slightly more than 87% mean accuracy. The NB-SVM produced
significantly more false negatives than false positives (P = 0.027), but the
random forest did not, making its prevalence estimates very close to the true
prevalence in the data. The best-performing neural network performed similarly
to the random forest on both measures. The random forest performed as well as
more recently available models like the NB-SVM and the neural network, and it
also produced good prevalence estimates. NB-SVM may not be a good candidate for
use in a fully-automated surveillance workflow due to increased false
negatives. More sophisticated algorithms, like hierarchical convolutional
neural networks, may not be feasible to train due to characteristics of the
data. Current algorithms might perform better if the data are abstracted and
processed differently and if they take into account information about the
children in addition to their evaluations.

analysis is a particularly promising area for DCNNs: indeed, the number of
available digital documents has reached unprecedented levels, and humans are no
longer able to discover and retrieve all the information contained in these
documents without the help of automation. Under this scenario, DCNNs offers a
viable solution to automate the information extraction process from digital
documents. Within the realm of information extraction from documents, detection
of tables and charts is particularly needed as they contain a visual summary of
the most valuable information contained in a document. For a complete
automation of visual information extraction process from tables and charts, it
is necessary to develop techniques that localize them and identify precisely
their boundaries. In this paper we aim at solving the table/chart detection
task through an approach that combines deep convolutional neural networks,
graphical models and saliency concepts. In particular, we propose a
saliency-based fully-convolutional neural network performing multi-scale

focusing on tidally induced bars formed from flyby interactions. To guarantee
high enough resolution we focus on high mass disc galaxies ($M_*>8.3 \times
10^{10} M_{\odot}$). We find that the fraction of barred galaxies among those
(21% at redshift $z=0$) is lower in Illustris than observed in the local
Universe, and the fraction grows slightly with redshift. The bar fraction also
increases with the stellar mass and decreases with the amount of gas in the
disc. Only very few bars at redshift $z=0$ are formed in secular evolution
($\sim$ 7%) and most of them are triggered by external perturbers in mergers or
flybys. Many of these bars disappear over time, mostly during secular
evolution, which leads to a lower fraction of bars at redshift $z=0$. We then
focus on the effect of flyby interactions on the disc and look at tidally
induced bars created by a flyby, or pre-existing bars influenced by the passage
of a perturber. In the latter case, the interaction can enhance or weaken the
bar. During the interaction, the change in the bar strength occurs right after
the pericentre passage. The resulting tidally induced bars tend to be stronger
than the overall bar sample in Illustris. The preferred scenario to create or
enhance a bar seems to be with a strong interaction involving a perturber on a
prograde orbit. Furthermore, the strength of the created bar grows with the
strength of the interaction.

representation models generally exploit spatial structure information among
patches in each frame separately which ignore (1) unary featureof each patch
and (2) temporal correlation among patches in different frames. To address this
problem, we propose a novel unified temporal coherence and graph optimized
ranking model for weighted patch representation in visual tracking problem.
There are three main contributions of this paper. First, we propose to employ a
flexible graph ranking for patch weight computation which exploits both
structure information among patches and unary feature of each patch
simultaneously. Second, we propose a new more discriminative ranking model by
further considering the temporal correlation among patches in different frames.
Third, a neighborhood preserved, low-rank graph is learned and incorporated to
build a unified optimized ranking model. Experiments on two benchmark datasets
show the benefits of our model.

handwritten word recognition systems. It is difficult to recognize handwritten
scripts for which sufficient training data is not readily available or it may
be expensive to collect such data. Hence, it becomes hard to train recognition
systems owing to lack of proper dataset. To overcome such problems, synthetic
data could be used to create or expand the existing training dataset to improve
recognition performance. Any available digital data from online newspaper and
such sources can be used to generate synthetic data. In this paper, we propose
to add distortion/deformation to digital data in such a way that the underlying
pattern is preserved, so that the image so produced bears a close similarity to
actual handwritten samples. The images thus produced can be used independently
to train the system or be combined with natural handwritten data to augment the
original dataset and improve the recognition system. We experimented using
synthetic data to improve the recognition accuracy of isolated characters and

encouraging results from the experiment. Finally, the experiment with Latin

the nuclear equation of state (EoS) around saturation density from nuclear
structure calculations on ground and collective excited state properties of
atomic nuclei. It concentrates on predictions based on self-consistent
mean-field calculations, which can be considered as an approximate realization
of an exact energy density functional (EDF). EDFs are derived from effective
interactions commonly fitted to nuclear masses, charge radii and, in many
cases, also to pseudo-data such as nuclear matter properties. Although in a
model dependent way, EDFs constitute nowadays a unique tool to reliably and
consistently access bulk ground state and collective excited state properties
of atomic nuclei along the nuclear chart as well as the EoS. For comparison,
some emphasis is also given to the results obtained with the so called {\it ab
initio} approaches that aim at describing the nuclear EoS based on interactions
fitted to few-body data only. Bridging the existent gap between these two
frameworks will be essential since it may allow to improve our understanding on
the diverse phenomenology observed in nuclei. Examples on observations from
astrophysical objects and processes sensitive to the nuclear EoS are also
briefly discussed. As the main conclusion, the isospin dependence of the
nuclear EoS around saturation density and, to a lesser extent, the nuclear
matter incompressibility remain to be accurately determined. Experimental and
theoretical efforts in finding and measuring observables specially sensitive to
the EoS properties are of paramount importance, not only for low-energy nuclear
physics but also for nuclear astrophysics applications.

the main socio-economic drivers behind the ascent of Bitcoin over this period.
Then, a detailed analysis of the growing risks associated with the three long
bubbles using the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model is based on
the LPPLS Confidence Indicators, defined as the fraction of qualified fits of
the LPPLS model over multiple time windows. Furthermore, for various fictitious
'present' times $t_2$ before the crashes, we employ a clustering method to
group the predicted critical times $t_c$ of the LPPLS fits over different time
scales, where $t_c$ is the most probable time for the ending of the bubble.
Each cluster is proposed as a plausible scenario for the subsequent Bitcoin
price evolution. We present these predictions for the three long bubbles and
the four short bubbles that our time scale of analysis was able to resolve.

into account both its structure and dynamics. In the first part, we introduce
the general mathematical setup for the types of dynamics we consider throughout
the chapter. We provide two guiding examples, namely consensus dynamics and
diffusion processes (random walks), motivating their connection to social
network analysis, and provide a brief discussion on the general dynamical
framework and its possible extensions. In the second part, we focus on the
influence of graph structure on the dynamics taking place on the network,
focusing on three concepts that allow us to gain insight into this notion.
First, we describe how time scale separation can appear in the dynamics on a
network as a consequence of graph structure. Second, we discuss how the
presence of particular symmetries in the network give rise to invariant
dynamical subspaces that can be precisely described by graph partitions. Third,
we show how this dynamical viewpoint can be extended to study dynamics on
networks with signed edges, which allow us to discuss connections to concepts
in social network analysis, such as structural balance. In the third part, we
discuss how to use dynamical processes unfolding on the network to detect
meaningful network substructures. We then show how such dynamical measures can
be related to seemingly different algorithm for community detection and
coarse-graining proposed in the literature. We conclude with a brief summary

polarized emission is along the minor axis of the disk, and that the value of
the polarization fraction increases steadily toward the center of the disk,
reaching a peak value of ~1.1%. All of these characteristics are consistent
with models of self-scattering of submillimeter-wave emission from an optically
thin inclined disk. The distribution of the polarization position angles across
the disk reveals that while the average orientation is along the minor axis,
the polarization orientations show a significant spread in angles; this can
also be explained by models of pure scattering. We compare the polarization
with that of the Class I/II source HL Tau. A comparison of cuts of the
polarization fraction across the major and minor axes of both sources reveals
that IM Lup has a substantially higher polarization fraction than HL Tau toward
the center of the disk. This enhanced polarization fraction could be due a
number of factors, including higher optical depth in HL Tau, or scattering by
larger dust grains in the more evolved IM Lup disk. However, models yield
similar maximum grain sizes for both HL Tau (72 $\mu$m) and IM Lup (61 $\mu$m,
this work). This reveals continued tension between grain-size estimates from
scattering models and from models of the dust emission spectrum, which find
that the bulk of the (unpolarized) emission in disks is most likely due to
millimeter (or even centimeter) sized grains.

Kirchhoff rod, we investigate emergent waveforms for different preferred strain

out-of-plane motion, in addition to studying a preferred planar sine wave
configuration, we also study the case with a preferred helical configuration.

stacking method to enhance S/N and to study the kinematics and disk properties

detections in 18 disks with 11 new detections in 13CO and 9 new detections in
C18O after applying the method. We estimate the disk orientations and the
dynamical stellar masses from the 13CO data. Our estimated dynamical stellar
masses correlate with the spectroscopic stellar masses, and in a subsample of
16 sources, where the inclination angles are better constrained, the two masses
are in a good agreement within the uncertainties and with a mean difference of
0.15 Msun. With more detections of fainter disks, our results show that high
gas masses derived from the 13CO and C18O lines tend to be associated with high
dust masses estimated from the continuum emission. Nevertheless, the scatter is
large (0.9 dex), implying large uncertainties in deriving the disk gas mass
from the line fluxes. We find that with such large uncertainties it is expected
that there is no correlation between the disk gas mass and the mass accretion

the long-ranged RVB correlations built in the acenes' ground state are
detrimental for the occurrence of open-shell diradical or polyradical
instabilities, previously found by lower-level theories. We substantiate our
outcome by a direct comparison with another wave function, tailored to be an
open-shell singlet (OSS) for long-enough acenes. By comparing on the same
footing the RVB and OSS wave functions, both optimized at a variational QMC
level, and further projected by the lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo
(LRDMC) method, we prove that the RVB wave function has always a lower
variational energy and better nodes than the OSS, for all molecular species
considered in this work. The entangled multi-reference RVB state acts against
the electron edge localization implied by the OSS wave function, and weakens
the diradical tendency for higher oligoacenes. These properties are reflected
by several descriptors, including wave function parameters, bond length
alternation, aromatic indices, and spin-spin correlation functions. In this
context, we propose a new aromatic index estimator suitable for geminal wave
functions. For the largest acenes taken into account, the long-range decay of
the charge-charge correlation functions is compatible with a quasi-metallic
behavior.

  models",,,,,"q-bio.BM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  MOTIVATION: Proteins fold into complex structures that are crucial for their
biological functions. Experimental determination of protein structures is
costly and therefore limited to a small fraction of all known proteins. Hence,
different computational structure prediction methods are necessary for the
modelling of the vast majority of all proteins. In most structure prediction
pipelines, the last step is to select the best available model and to estimate
its accuracy. This model quality estimation problem has been growing in
importance during the last decade, and progress is believed to be important for
large scale modelling of proteins. The current generation of model quality
estimation programs performs well at separating incorrect and good models, but
fails to consistently identify the best possible model. State-of-the-art model
quality assessment methods use a combination of features that describe a model
and the agreement of the model with features predicted from the protein
sequence.
  RESULTS: We first introduce a deep neural network architecture to predict
model quality using significantly fewer input features than state-of-the-art
methods. Thereafter, we propose a methodology to train the deep network that
leverages the comparative structure of the problem. We also show the
possibility of applying transfer learning on databases of known protein
structures. We demonstrate its viability by reaching state-of-the-art
performance using only a reduced set of input features and a coarse description
of the models.

energy. This problem was discovered by reducing a ground-state energy generated
from an approximate N-particle wavefunction into a functional of the 1RDM,
known as the top-down method. Here, we show that the phase dilemma also appears
in the bottom-up method, in which the functional E[1RDM] is generated by
progressive inclusion of N-representability conditions on the reconstructed
two-particle reduced density matrix. It is shown that an adequate choice of
signs is essential to accurately describe model systems with strong non-dynamic

with periodic boundary conditions and hydrogen rings. For the latter, the Piris

FKPP fronts can propagate against the flow while G fronts cannot. We verify our

theories of gravity. Using Feynman rules one can compute scattering amplitudes
describing the interaction between gravitons and other fields. Here, we
consider the interaction between gravitons and photons. Using the quantum
Boltzmann equation formalism, we derive fully general equations describing the
radiation transfer of photon polarization, due to the forward scattering with
gravitons. We show that the Q and U photon linear polarization modes couple
with the V photon circular polarization mode, if gravitons have anisotropies in
their power-spectrum statistics. As an example, we apply our results to the
case of primordial gravitons, considering models of inflation where an
anisotropic primordial graviton distribution is produced. Finally, we evaluate
the effect on cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization, showing that in
general the expected effects on the observable CMB frequencies are very small.
However, our result is promising, since it could provide a novel tool for
detecting anisotropic backgrounds of gravitational waves, as well as for
getting further insight on the physics of gravitational waves.

explicit-implicit treatments to stress and convective terms, we construct first

be performed under strict computational constraints making online planning in

Emergent Value function Approximation for Distributed Environments (EVADE), an
approach to integrate global experience into multi-agent online planning in

purpose, a value function is approximated online based on the emergent system
behaviour by using methods of reinforcement learning. We empirically evaluated
EVADE with two statistical multi-agent online planning algorithms in a highly
complex and stochastic smart factory environment, where multiple agents need to
process various items at a shared set of machines. Our experiments show that
EVADE can effectively improve the performance of multi-agent online planning

are still debated. Moreover, because of its peculiar position and proper
motion, it is not clear if the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) within the remnant is
the relic of the IC443 progenitor star or just a rambling one seen in
projection on the remnant. Here we address the study of IC443 plasma in order
to clarify the relationship PWN-remnant, the presence of overionization and the
origin of the latter. We analyzed two \emph{XMM-Newton} observations producing
background-subtracted, vignetting-corrected and mosaicked images in two
different energy bands and we performed a spatially resolved spectral analysis
of the X-ray emission. We identified an elongated (jet-like) structure with
Mg-rich plasma in overionization. The head of the jet is interacting with a
molecular cloud and the jet is aligned with the position of the PWN at the
instant of the supernova explosion. Interestingly, the direction of the jet of
ejecta is somehow consistent with the direction of the PWN jet. Our discovery
of a jet of ejecta in IC443 enlarge the sample of core-collapse SNRs with
collimated ejecta structures. IC443's jet is the first one which shows
overionized plasma, possibly associated with the adiabatic expansion of ejecta.
The match between the jet's direction and the original position of the PWN
strongly supports the association between the neutron star and IC443.

affine symmetry in differential geometry is to define a Cartan connection on an
affine bundle over spacetime. This is equivalent to (1) defining an affine
connection on the affine bundle, (2) defining a zero section on the associated
affine vector bundle, and (3) using the affine connection and the zero section
to define an ""associated solder form,"" whose lift to a tensorial form on the
frame bundle becomes the solder form. The zero section reduces the affine
bundle to a linear bundle and splits the affine connection into translational
and homogeneous parts; however it violates translational equivariance / gauge
symmetry. This is the natural geometric framework for Einstein-Cartan theory as
an affine theory of gravitation. The last section discusses some alternative
approaches that claim to preserve translational gauge symmetry.

evolved consistent with the divergence constraints. As a result, there has been
a recent effort to design finite volume time domain (FVTD) and discontinuous
Galerkin time domain (DGTD) schemes that satisfy the same constraints and,
nevertheless, draw on recent advances in higher order Godunov methods. This
paper catalogues the first step in the design of globally constraint-preserving
DGTD schemes. The algorithms presented here are based on a novel DG-like method
that is applied to a Yee-type staggering of the electromagnetic field variables
in the faces of the mesh. The other two novel building blocks of the method
include constraint-preserving reconstruction of the electromagnetic fields and
multidimensional Riemann solvers; both of which have been developed in recent
years by the first author. We carry out a von Neumann stability analysis of the
entire suite of DGTD schemes for CED at orders of accuracy ranging from second
to fourth. A von Neumann stability analysis gives us the maximal CFL numbers
that can be sustained by the DGTD schemes presented here at all orders. It also
enables us to understand the wave propagation characteristics of the schemes in
various directions on a Cartesian mesh. We find that the CFL of DGTD schemes
decreases with increasing order. To counteract that, we also present
constraint-preserving PNPM schemes for CED. We find that the third and fourth
order constraint-preserving DGTD and P1PM schemes have some extremely
attractive properties when it comes to low-dispersion, low-dissipation
propagation of electromagnetic waves in multidimensions. Numerical accuracy
tests are also provided to support the von Neumann stability analysis.

worst case design. Much shorter data types can be used if we target the common

Precision Reduction (DPRed), where we group weights and activations and encode
them using a precision specific to each group. The per group precisions are
selected statically for the weights and dynamically by hardware for the
activations. We exploit these precisions to reduce: 1) off-chip storage and
off- and on-chip communication, and 2) execution time. DPRed compression
reduces off-chip traffic to nearly 35% and 33% on average compared to no
compression respectively for 16b and 8b models. This makes it possible to
sustain higher performance for a given off-chip memory interface while also
boosting energy efficiency. We also demonstrate designs where the time required
to process each group of activations and/or weights scales proportionally to
the precision they use for convolutional and fully-connected layers. This
improves execution time and energy efficiency for both dense and sparse

Moreover, they formalize OBS as type systems at the language-level, which can

automated verification of runtime behavior.
  In this paper, we propose RustSEM, a new executable operational semantics for

existing semantics. Moreover, RustSEM provides an operational semantics for OBS
at the memory-level, which can be used to verify the runtime behavior of Rust

correctness of RustSEM wrt. the Rust compiler using around 700 tests. In
particular, we have proposed a new technique for testing semantic consistency
to ensure the absence of semantic ambiguities on all possible execution

attracting attention. Drone-BSs can assist the ground BSs in both capacity and
coverage enhancement. One of the important problems about integrating drone-BSs
to cellular networks is the management of their placement to satisfy the
dynamic system requirements. In this paper, we propose a method to find the
positions of drone-BSs in an area with different user densities using a
heuristic algorithm. The goal is to find the minimum number of drone-BSs and
their 3D placement so that all the users are served. Our simulation results
show that the proposed approach can satisfy the quality-of-service requirements
of the network.

mechanical, electrical, and magnetic boundary conditions at both the upper and
lower free surfaces of the PEM plate are exploited: the mechanically free
surface, continuity of both the electrical and magnetic inductions, and
continuity of both the electrical and magnetic potentials. The obtained
dispersion relations were also graphically studied and compared with previous
results. Some interesting peculiarities were also discussed. It is well-known
that the plate waves are frequently used for nondestructive testing and
evaluation of thin films, further miniaturization of different technical
devices based on PEM smart materials, and constitution of new technical devices
such as filters, sensors, delay lines, switches, lab-on-a-chip, etc.

  Discrete Systems","4 pages,1 figure",,"10.7566/JPSJ.88.104803",,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For classical systems, expectation value of macroscopic property in
equilibrium state can be typically provided through thermodynamic (so-called
canonical) average, where summation is taken over possible states in phase
space (or in crystalline solids, it is typically approximated on cofiguration
space). Although we have a number of theoretical approaches enabling to
quantitatively estimate equilibrium properties by applying given potential
energy surface (PES) to the thermodynamic average, it is generally unclear
whether PES can be stablly, inversely determined from a given set of
properties. This essentially comes from the fact that bidirectional stability
characters of thermodynamic average for classical system is not sufficiently
understood so far. Our recent study reveals that for classical discrete system,
this property for a set of microscopic states satisfying special condition can
be well-characterized by a newly-introduced concept of anharmonicity in the
structural degree of freedom of D, where these states are expected to be stably
inversed to underlying PES, known without any thermodynamic information.
However, it is still quantitatively unclear how the bidirectional stability
character is broken inside the configuration space. Here we show that the
breaking in bidirectional stability for thermodynamic average is quantitatively
formulated: We find that the breaking is mainly dominated by the sum of
divergence and Jacobian of vector field D in configuration space, which can be
fully known a priori only from geometric information of underlying lattice,
without using any thermodynamic information such as energy or temperature.

for quantum information and quantum computation in the construction of coherent
combinations of quantum states. However, due to their small binding energy and
low transition efficiency, most biexcitons in conventional semiconductors exist
either at cryogenic temperature or under femtosecond pulse laser excitation.
Here we demonstrate room temperature, continuous wave driven biexciton states
in CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals through coupling with a plasmonic nanogap.
The room temperature CsPbBr3 biexciton excitation fluence (~100 mW/cm2) is
reduced by ~10^13 times in the Ag nanowire-film nanogaps. The giant enhancement
of biexciton emission is driven by coherent biexciton-plasmon Fano
interference. These results provide new pathways to develop high efficiency
non-blinking single photon sources, entangled light sources and lasers based on
biexciton states.

attracted tremendous attention from many research communities. In particular,
increasing research efforts have been dedicated to the complementary clothing
matching as matching clothes to make a suitable outfit has become a daily
headache for many people, especially those who do not have the sense of
aesthetics. Thanks to the remarkable success of neural networks in various
applications such as image classification and speech recognition, the
researchers are enabled to adopt the data-driven learning methods to analyze
fashion items. Nevertheless, existing studies overlook the rich valuable
knowledge (rules) accumulated in fashion domain, especially the rules regarding
clothing matching. Towards this end, in this work, we shed light on
complementary clothing matching by integrating the advanced deep neural
networks and the rich fashion domain knowledge. Considering that the rules can
be fuzzy and different rules may have different confidence levels to different
samples, we present a neural compatibility modeling scheme with attentive
knowledge distillation based on the teacher-student network scheme. Extensive
experiments on the real-world dataset show the superiority of our model over
several state-of-the-art baselines. Based upon the comparisons, we observe
certain fashion insights that add value to the fashion matching study. As a
byproduct, we released the codes, and involved parameters to benefit other
researchers.
