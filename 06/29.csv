  Ventre","Spark-Based Anomaly Detection: the Case of Port and Net Scan",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The two most spread network anomalies are port and net scan. In this work, we
present and analyze the results obtained by traditional approaches for the
detection of net scan and port scans. We use a simple threshold-based
algorithm, working at flow-level and adapt it for the execution on Apache
Spark. The use of Big Data Analytics technologies allows to significantly the
execution times of the algorithm so to be used even in current, high-speed
networks. The paper describes our approach and presents an experimental
analysis in terms of detection performance and execution time. We use real
traffic traces from MAWI archive and MAWILab anomaly detectors to compare with
our results. The analysis shows that i) our traditional threshold-based
algorithm is already able to achieve detection performance higher than MAWILab
(in 95% of the considered cases with the best threshold value), currently
considered the gold standard in the field; ii) the execution time is much
shorter than the trace time, which makes it usable also in real time. Moreover,
for each traffic trace we provide the research community with a new labeled
dataset, validated by comparisons with MAWILab and extended with other
anomalies not detected by it. We publish an updated dataset every day at our
project website.

convex (or non-convex) stochastic optimization. Among existing variance
reduction methods, SVRG and SAGA adopt unbiased gradient estimators and are the
most popular variance reduction methods in recent years. Although various
accelerated variants of SVRG (e.g., Katyusha and Acc-Prox-SVRG) have been
proposed, the direct acceleration of SAGA still remains unknown. In this paper,
we propose a directly accelerated variant of SAGA using a novel Sampled
Negative Momentum (SSNM), which achieves the best known oracle complexity for
strongly convex problems (with known strong convexity parameter). Consequently,
our work fills the void of directly accelerated SAGA.

expels solvent and deswells. When this heating is slow, deswelling proceeds
homogeneously, as observed in a toroid-shaped gel that changes volume whilst
maintaining its toroidal shape. By contrast, if the gel is heated quickly, an
impermeable layer of collapsed polymer forms and traps solvent within the gel,
arresting the volume change. The ensuing evolution of the gel then happens at
fixed volume, leading to phase-separation and the development of inhomogeneous
stress that deforms the toroidal shape. We observe that this stress can cause
the torus to buckle out of the plane, via a mechanism analogous to the bending
of bimetallic strips upon heating. Our results demonstrate that thermodynamic

establish the relationship among the lepton masses and mixings and their
analogous properties in the quark sector. The extraction of the neutrino mass
ordering is a data-driven field expected to evolve very rapidly in the next
decade. In this review, we both analyze the present status and describe the
physics of subsequent prospects. Firstly, the different current available tools
to measure the neutrino mass ordering are described. Namely, reactor,
long-baseline (accelerator and atmospheric) neutrino beams, laboratory searches
for beta and neutrinoless double beta decays and observations of the cosmic
background radiation and the large scale structure of the universe are
carefully reviewed. Secondly, the results from an up-to-date comprehensive
global fit are reported: the Bayesian analysis to the 2018 publicly available
oscillation and cosmological data sets provides \emph{strong} evidence for the
normal neutrino mass ordering versus the inverted scenario, with a significance
of 3.5 standard deviations. This preference for the normal neutrino mass
ordering is mostly due to neutrino oscillation measurements. Finally, we shall
also emphasize the future perspectives for unveiling the neutrino mass
ordering. In this regard, apart from describing the expectations from the
aforementioned probes, we also focus on those arising from alternative and
novel methods, as 21~cm cosmology, core-collapse supernova neutrinos and the
direct detection of relic neutrinos.

addition of a cellular cloud controller to take over the management of the

shift the Rashba point and modify the Rashba parameter. This effect is
equivalent to the application of in-plane magnetic fields. The out-of-plane
strain, which is proportional to the electric polarization, is also shown to
modify the Rashba parameter. Overall, our theory connects strain and spin
splitting in ferroelectric Rashba materials, which will be important to
understand the strain-induced variations in local Rashba parameters that will
occur in practical applications.

where $d$ denotes the usual graph distance on $Q_{n}$. Harper's
vertex-isoperimetric theorem states that among the subsets $A\subseteq Q_{n}$
of given size, the size of the $t$-neighbourhood is minimised when $A$ is taken
to be an initial segment of the simplicial order. Aubrun and Szarek asked the
following question: if $A\subseteq Q_{n}$ is a subset of given size for which
the sizes of both $N^{t}\left(A\right)$ and $N^{t}\left(A^{c}\right)$ are
minimal for all $t>0$, does it follow that $A$ is isomorphic to an initial

  Our aim is to give a counterexample. Surprisingly it turns out that there is
no counterexample that is a Hamming ball, meaning a set that lies between two
consecutive exact Hamming balls, i.e.\ a set $A$ with
$B\left(x,r\right)\subseteq A\subseteq B\left(x,r+1\right)$ for some $x\in

sizes of both $N^{t}\left(A\right)$ and $N^{t}\left(A^{c}\right)$ are minimal
for all $t>0$ among the subsets of $Q_{n}$ of given size. We also prove that,
perhaps surprisingly, if $A\subseteq Q_{n}$ for which the sizes of
$N\left(A\right)$ and $N\left(A^{c}\right)$ are minimal among the subsets of
$Q_{n}$ of given size, then the sizes of both $N^{t}\left(A\right)$ and
$N^{t}\left(A^{c}\right)$ are also minimal for all $t>0$ among the subsets of

Laguerre-Gaussian modes, obtaining a quantum bit error rate (QBER) that is up

with inequality that benefits leaders. To control despotic behaviour, followers
can assess leaders decisions by aggregating their own and their neighbours
experience, and in response challenge despotic leaders. But in hierarchical
social networks, this interactional justice can be limited by (i) the high
influence of a small clique who are treated better, and (ii) the low
connectedness of followers. Here we study how the connectedness of a social
network affects the co-evolution of despotism in leaders and tolerance to
despotism in followers. We simulate the evolution of a population of agents,
where the influence of an agent is its number of social links. Whether a leader
remains in power is controlled by the overall satisfaction of group members, as
determined by their joint assessment of the leaders behaviour. We demonstrate
that centralization of a social network around a highly influential clique
greatly increases the level of despotism. This is because the clique is more
satisfied, and their higher influence spreads their positive opinion of the
leader throughout the network. Finally, our results suggest that increasing the
connectedness of followers limits despotism while maintaining hierarchy.

the limit of strong optical nonlinearities (hard-core limit), the BHM maps on
the dissipative, transverse-field XY model (XYM). The steady-state of the XYM
can be analyzed using mean-field theory, which reveals a plethora of
interesting dynamical phenomena. For example, strong hopping combined with a
blue-detuned drive, leads to an instability of the homogeneous steady-state

question whether such an antiferromagnetic instability survives in the presence
of quantum correlations beyond the mean-field approximation. For that purpose,
we employ a self-consistent $1/z$ expansion for the density matrix, where $z$
is the lattice coordination number, i.e., the number of nearest neighbours for
each site. We show that quantum fluctuations stabilize a new homogeneous
steady-state with antiferromagnetic correlations in agreement with exact

short-ranged oscillations of the first and second-order spatial coherence

experiment produces a one dimensional (1D) 1H spectrum containing several peaks
that are well associated with biochemicals, or metabolites. However, since many
of these peaks overlap, distinguishing chemicals with similar atomic structures
becomes much more challenging. One technique capable of overcoming this issue
is the localized correlated spectroscopy (L-COSY) experiment, which acquires a
second spectral dimension and spreads overlapping signal across this second
dimension. Unfortunately, the acquisition of a two dimensional (2D)
spectroscopy experiment is extremely time consuming. Furthermore, quantitation
of a 2D spectrum is more complex. Recently, artificial intelligence has emerged
in the field of medicine as a powerful force capable of diagnosing disease,
aiding in treatment, and even predicting treatment outcome. In this study, we
utilize deep learning to: 1) accelerate the L-COSY experiment and 2) quantify
L-COSY spectra. We demonstrate that our deep learning model greatly outperforms
compressed sensing based reconstruction of L-COSY spectra at higher
acceleration factors. Specifically, at four-fold acceleration, our method has
less than 5% normalized mean squared error, whereas compressed sensing yields
20% normalized mean squared error. We also show that at low SNR (25% noise
compared to maximum signal), our deep learning model has less than 8%
normalized mean squared error for quantitation of L-COSY spectra. These pilot

back-and-forth rotational motion facilitates the effective diffusion

synchronous with the magnetic field suppresses the effective diffusion
coefficient and enhances the rectification. There exist optimized values of the

sufficiently large $r$, we prove that orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants of
$X_{D,r}$ are polynomials in $r$. Moreover, higher genus relative Gromov-Witten
invariants of $(X,D)$ are exactly the constant terms of the corresponding
higher genus orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants of $X_{D,r}$. We also provide a
new proof for the equality between genus zero relative and orbifold

statistical inference. In this paper we consider sparse vector autoregressive
models and develop appropriate bootstrap methods to infer properties of such
processes. Our bootstrap methodology generates pseudo time series using a
model-based bootstrap procedure which involves an estimated, sparsified version
of the underlying vector autoregressive model. Inference is performed using
so-called de-sparsified or de-biased estimators of the autoregressive model
parameters. We derive the asymptotic distribution of such estimators in the
time series context and establish asymptotic validity of the bootstrap
procedure proposed for estimation and, appropriately modified, for testing
purposes. In particular we focus on testing that large groups of autoregressive
coefficients equal zero. Our theoretical results are complemented by
simulations which investigate the finite sample performance of the bootstrap
methodology proposed. A real-life data application is also presented.

the line-of-sight, which tend to exhibit multi-wavelength variability on a
variety of timescales. Quasi-periodic variability on year-like timescales has
been detected in a number of bright sources, and has been connected to the
orbital motion of a putative massive black hole binary. If this were indeed the
case, those blazar binaries would contribute to the nanohertz
gravitational-wave stochastic background. We test the binary hypothesis for the
blazar population observed by the \textit{Fermi} Gamma-Ray Space Telescope,
which consists of BL Lacertae objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars. Using
mock populations informed by the luminosity functions for BL Lacertae objects
and flat-spectrum radio quasars with redshifts $z \le 2$, we calculate the
expected gravitational wave background and compare it to recent pulsar timing
array upper limits. The two are consistent only if a fraction $\lesssim
10^{-3}$ of blazars hosts a binary with orbital periods $<5$ years. We

holes (IMBHs) are vital for planned gravitational-wave detection experiments
such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Using collisionless
$N$-body simulations of dwarf galaxy (DG) mergers, we examine how the orbital
decay of IMBHs and the efficiency of IMBH binary formation depend on the
central dark matter (DM) density profile of the merging DGs. Specifically, we
explore various asymptotic inner slopes $\gamma$ of the DG's DM density
distribution, ranging from steep cusps ($\gamma=1$) to shallower density
profiles ($\gamma<1$), motivated by well-known baryonic-feedback effects as
well as by DM models that differ from cold DM at the scales of DGs. We find
that the inner DM slope is crucial for the formation (or lack thereof) of an
IMBH binary; only mergers between DGs with cuspy DM profiles ($\gamma=1$) are
favourable to forming a hard IMBH binary, whereas when $\gamma<1$ the IMBHs
stall at a separation of 50-100 pc. Consequently, the rate of LISA signals from
IMBH coalescence will be determined by the fraction of DGs with a cuspy DM
profile. Conversely, the LISA event rates at IMBH mass scales offer in
principle a novel way to place constraints on the inner structure of DM halos
in DGs and address the core-cusp controversy. We also show that, with spatial
resolutions of $\sim$0.1 kpc, as often adopted in cosmological simulations, all
IMBHs stall, independent of $\gamma$. This suggests caution in employing
cosmological simulations of galaxy formation to study BH dynamics in DGs.

assumptions on the shapes of the galaxy and cluster mass distributions, which
may or may not apply in a highly non-equilibrium environment of a merging

reliable, it must be supported by a wide range of lens inversion methods.

the usual torus scenario, though this scattered component can only be directly
observed from the core in the near-IR. By contrast, the gradual rotation by

either a black hole (BH) or a neutron star (NS) have during a CE phase. The jet
is self-consistently powered by a fraction ($\eta$) of the mass accretion rate

jet is not able to drill through the material accreting onto the CO and forms a

oscillating mass accretion rate behavior. We find that the jet may deposit
enough energy to unbind the outer layers of the CE. The self-regulated jets
present variability in size and orientation while their cocoons expand smoothly
over the CE. The mass accretion rate initially decreases due to the ram
pressure of the cocoon. If the launched jet is not able to drill through the
bulge, the accretion is such that it may convert a NS into a BH within a decade

ways to handle effects of non-linear gravitational structure formation in data.
To address these needs we present an extension of our previously developed
algorithm for Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies to analyse matter
clustering at non-linear scales in observations. This is achieved by
incorporating a numerical particle mesh model of structure formation into our
Bayesian inference framework. The algorithm simultaneously infers the 3D
primordial matter fluctuations from which present non-linear observations
formed and provides reconstructions of velocity fields and structure formation
histories. The physical forward modelling approach automatically accounts for
non-Gaussian features in evolved matter density fields and addresses the
redshift space distortion problem associated with peculiar motions of galaxies.
Our algorithm employs a hierarchical Bayes approach to jointly account for
observational effects, such as galaxy biases, selection effects, and noise.
Corresponding parameters are marginalized out via a sophisticated Markov Chain
Monte Carlo approach relying on a combination of a multiple block sampling
framework and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. We demonstrate the performance
of the method by applying it to the 2M++ galaxy compilation, tracing the matter
distribution of the Nearby Universe. We show accurate and detailed inferences
of the 3D non-linear dark matter distribution of the Nearby Universe. As
exemplified in the case of the Coma cluster, we provide mass estimates that are
compatible with those obtained from weak lensing and X-ray observations. For
the first time, we reconstruct the vorticity of the non-linear velocity field
from observations. In summary, our method provides plausible and detailed
inferences of dark matter and velocity fields of our cosmic neighbourhood.

N-body simulations and analytical modelling. We find that selecting the massive
tail of collapsed objects at $z\gtrsim 9$ as GC formation sites leads to four
main predictions: i) a highly clustered population of GCs around galaxies
today, ii) a natural scaling between number of GCs and halo virial mass that
follows roughly the observed trend, iii) a very low number of free floating GCs
outside massive halos and iv) GCs should be embedded within massive and
extended dark matter (sub)halos. We find that the strongest constraint to the
model is given by the combination of (i) and (ii): a mass cut to tagged GCs
halos which accounts for the number density of metal poor GCs today predicts a
radial distribution that is too extended compared to recent observations. On
the other hand, a mass cut sufficient to match the observed half number radius
could only explain 60% of the metal poor population. In all cases, observations
favour early redshifts for GC formation ($z\geq 15$).

Analysis we identify the key axes of correlation between these physical
quantities, for the full galaxy sample and split by satellite/central and
low/high halo mass. The first principal component of the z=0 EAGLE galaxy
population is a positive correlation between M_halo, M* and SFR. This component
is particularly dominant for central galaxies in low mass haloes. The second
principal component, most significant in high mass haloes, is a negative
correlation between M_halo and SFR, indicative of environmental quenching. For
galaxies above M*~10^10M_solar, however, the SFR is seen to decouple from the
M_halo-M* correlation; this result is found to be independent of environment,
suggesting that mass quenching effects are also in operation. We find extremely
good agreement between the EAGLE principal components and those of SDSS
galaxies; this lends confidence to our conclusions. Extending our study to
EAGLE galaxies in the range z=0-4, we find that, although the relative numbers
of galaxies in the different subsamples change, their principal components do
not change significantly with redshift. This indicates that the physical
processes that govern the evolution of galaxies within their dark matter haloes
act similarly throughout cosmic time. Finally, we present halo occupation

Using new, high resolution CO imaging from the PHANGS-ALMA survey, we estimate
the gravitational free-fall time at 60 to 120 pc resolution, and contrast this
with the local molecular gas depletion time to estimate $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$.
Assuming a constant thickness of the molecular gas layer ($H = 100$ pc) across

$0.7\%$. We find a mild scale-dependence, with higher $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$

inherent errors. These appear when discretizing the time evolution generated by
the Hamiltonian of a quantum many-body system as a sequence of quantum gates,
called Trotterization. Here, we show that quantum localization-by constraining
the time evolution through quantum interference-strongly bounds these errors
for local observables. Consequently, for generic quantum many-body
Hamiltonians, Trotter errors can become independent of system size and total
simulation time. For local observables, DQS is thus intrinsically much more
robust than what one might expect from known error bounds on the global
many-body wave function. This robustness is characterized by a sharp threshold
as a function of the Trotter step size. The threshold separates a regular
region with controllable Trotter errors, where the system exhibits localization
in the space of eigenstates of the time-evolution operator, from a quantum
chaotic regime where the trajectory is quickly scrambled throughout the entire
Hilbert space. Our findings show that DQS with comparatively large Trotter
steps can retain controlled Trotter errors for local observables. It is thus
possible to reduce the number of quantum gate operations required to represent
the desired time evolution faithfully, thereby mitigating the effects of
imperfect individual gate operations

bolometric corrections to AGN luminosities. Using AKARI's far-IR wavelength
photometry and broadband AGN/galaxy spectral templates, we estimate AGN dust
mass and temperature using simple analytic models with 3-4 parameters. Even
without spectroscopic data, we can determine a number of AGN dust properties
only using SED analysis. These methods, combined with the abundance of archival
photometric data publically available, will be valuable for large-scale studies
of dusty, IR-luminous AGNs.

outflow discovered from the UKIRT Widefield Infrared Survey for H$_2$. The
outflow is located in the infrared dark cloud core MSXDC G053.11+00.05 MM1 at
1.7 kpc and likely associated with two young stellar objects (YSOs) at the
center. The overall morphology of the outflow is bipolar along the NE-SW
direction with a brighter lobe to the southwest, but the detailed structure
consists of several flows and knots. With the total length of $\sim$1 pc, the
outflow luminosity is fairly high with $L_{\rm H_{2}} > 6~L_{\sun}$, implying a
massive outflow-driving YSO if the entire outflow is driven by a single source.
The two putative driving sources, located at the outflow center, show
photometric variability of $\gtrsim$1 mag in {\it H}- and {\it K}-bands. This,
with their early evolutionary stage from spectral energy distribution (SED)
fitting, indicates that both are capable of ejecting outflows and may be
eruptive variable YSOs. The YSO masses inferred from SED fitting are
$\sim$10~$M_{\sun}$ and $\sim$5~$M_{\sun}$, suggesting the association of the
outflow with massive YSOs. The geometrical morphology of the outflow is well
explained by the lower mass YSO by assuming a single source origin, but without
kinematic information, the contribution from the higher mass YSO cannot be
ruled out. Considering star formation process by fragmentation of a high-mass
core into several lower mass stars, we also suggest the possible presence of
another, yet-undetected driving source deeply embedded in the core.

When executing a task parallel program on modern NUMA architectures, it can
fail to scale due to the phenomenon called work inflation, where the overall
processing time that multiple cores spend on doing useful work is higher
compared to the time required to do the same amount of work on one core, due to
effects experienced only during parallel executions such as additional cache
misses, remote memory accesses, and memory bandwidth issues. It's possible to
mitigate work inflation by co-locating the computation with the data, but this
is nontrivial to do with task parallel programs. First, by design, the
scheduling for task parallel programs is automated, giving the user little
control over where the computation is performed. Second, the platforms tend to
employ work stealing, which provides strong theoretical guarantees, but its
randomized protocol for load balancing does not discern between work items that
are far away versus ones that are closer. In this work, we propose NUMA-WS, a
NUMA-aware task parallel platform engineering based on the work-first
principle. By abiding by the work-first principle, we are able to obtain a
platform that is work efficient, provides the same theoretical guarantees as
the classic work stealing scheduler, and mitigates work inflation. Furthermore,
we implemented a prototype platform by modifying Intel's Cilk Plus runtime
system and empirically demonstrate that the resulting system is work efficient
and scalable.

negative temperatures arise inevitably on inner horizons, as does the
conventional form of the first law. We provide many new examples of this

exactly half the total energy of the system, and the right-hand sector
contributes the other half. Both the sectors satisfy conventional first laws

cosmological horizon is naturally assigned a negative Gibbsian temperature. We
also explore entropy-product formulae and a novel entropy-inversion formula,

insufficient training data due to various annotation difficulties in 3D

on several biomedical image datasets, and the experimental results show that
(1) with full annotated boxes and a small amount of masks, our approach can
achieve similar performance as the best known methods using full annotation,

perform a task chosen by the attacker---without the attacker needing to specify
or compute the desired output for each test-time input. This attack finds a
single adversarial perturbation, that can be added to all test-time inputs to a
machine learning model in order to cause the model to perform a task chosen by
the adversary---even if the model was not trained to do this task. These
perturbations can thus be considered a program for the new task. We demonstrate
adversarial reprogramming on six ImageNet classification models, repurposing
these models to perform a counting task, as well as classification tasks:
classification of MNIST and CIFAR-10 examples presented as inputs to the

recovery expressions to labels, where a label now not only reports a syntax

this paper and the claim of a nearly constant parameter $X$ for these six
comets is confirmed, albeit with a larger scatter. Taking the geometric mean of
$X$ for all the comets above excluding 2P/Encke (as $X$ for each comet was
determined with respect to that of 2P/Encke), the expected changes in the
rotation periods for a sample of 24 periodic comets are derived. We identify
comets from this sample that are most likely to show observationally detectable
changes in their rotation periods. Using this sample and including the six
comets used to determine $X$, we find a correlation between the parameter
$\zeta$ (i.e. the total water production per unit surface area per orbit
approximated by that inside of 4 au) and the perihelion distance $q$;
specifically we derive $\zeta$ $\propto$ $q^{-0.8}$ and provide a theoretical
basis for this in Appendix A. This relationship between $\zeta$ and $q$ enables
ready comparisons of activity due to insolation between comets. Additionally, a
relationship between the nuclear radius $R$ and the rotation period $P$ is
found. Specifically, we find that on average smaller nuclei have smaller
rotation periods compared to the rotation periods of larger nuclei. This is
consistent with expectations for rotational evolution and spin-up of comet
nuclei, providing strong observational evidence for sublimation-driven
rotational changes in comets.

from the merger of a Binary Neutron Stars and its low energy counterparts were
in many respects unusual and challenge our understanding of mechanisms involved

of relativistic shocks and synchrotron emission to analyse the prompt gamma-ray
emission of GW/GRB 170817A. Here we use the same model to analyse late
afterglows of this event. The main goal is to see whether synchrotron emission
alone can explain late afterglows. We find that collision between a mildly
relativistic outflow from the merger with a Lorentz factor of $\sim 1.2-3$ and
the ISM/circumburst material can explain observations, if the synchrotron
self-absorption of radio emission and extinction of optical/IR photons are
taken into account. Alternatively, an additional source of X-ray is necessary
to explain the data. These conclusions are independent of the model used here
and can be deduced directly from data. We also show that at the time of its
encounter with circumburst material the outflow could have been still mildly
magnetized. The origin for optical extinction could be a dust rich old faint
star cluster surrounding the BNS, which had also helped its formation and
merger. Such environment evades present observational constraints and is
consistent with our conclusions about properties and evolution of the
progenitor neutron stars obtained from the prompt gamma-ray. If the synchrotron
emission was produced by collision between density shells, the extinction might
have occurred inside the outflow itself rather than externally. A plausible
source of additional X-ray is decay of medium and heavy isotopes produced by
the kilonova, including r-processes, and recombination of cooled electrons.
Contribution of these processes should be quantified in future works.

weakly magnetized plasma are presented. The key difference between this dynamo
and its magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) counterpart is the adiabatic production of
magnetic-field-aligned pressure anisotropy by the amplification of a weak seed
field. This in turn drives kinetic instabilities on the ion-Larmor
scale---namely, firehose and mirror---which sever the adiabatic link between
the thermal and magnetic pressures, thereby allowing the dynamo to proceed.
After an initial phase of rapid growth driven by these instabilities, the
magnetic energy grows exponentially and exhibits a $k^{3/2}$ spectrum that
peaks near the resistive scale, similar to the large-magnetic-Prandtl-number
($\mathrm{Pm}\gg{1}$) MHD dynamo. The magnetic field self-organizes into a
folded-sheet topology, with direction reversals at the resistive scale and
field lines curved at the parallel scale of the flow. The effective
$\mathrm{Pm}$ is determined by whether the ion-Larmor scale is above or below
the field-reversing scale: in the former case, particles undergo Bohm-like
diffusion; in the latter case, particles scatter primarily off firehose
fluctuations residing at the ends of the magnetic folds, and the viscosity
becomes anisotropic. The magnetic field ultimately saturates at dynamical
strengths, with its spectral peak migrating towards larger scales. This
feature, along with an anti-correlation of magnetic-field strength and
field-line curvature and a gradual thinning of magnetic sheets into ribbons,
resemble the saturated state of the large-$\mathrm{Pm}$ dynamo, the primary
differences manifesting in firehose/mirror-unstable regions. These results have
implications for magnetic-field growth in the weakly collisional intracluster
medium of galaxy clusters.

also run simulations including a background radiative heating source, showing
that this can also produce clouds that do not fragment, and that the critical

some dependence on the NS equation of state (EoS). We then calculate the
detectability of GW signals emitted by newborn magnetars subject to

realistic signal searches. For an optimal range of $\epsilon_B \sim (1-5)

of $\gtrsim 4$ Mpc, and $\gtrsim 30$ Mpc, for Advanced and third generation

kilonova) is expected as the electromagnetic counterpart of such GW events.
Outside of the optimal range for GW emission, EM torques are more efficient in
extracting the NS spin energy, which may power even brighter EM transients.

contains a transverse trace-free mode and a scalar one. The scalar mode
displays a tachyonic nature during the slow-roll phase, due to the instability
of the system, whereas it acquires the appropriate oscillatory behavior as the
background approaches a critical value of the curvature. These results confirm
the fact that the Einstein-Hilbert term acts as a perturbation to the quadratic

energetic costs for an organism, there is a baseline selective disadvantage
that may or may not be compensated for by other adaptive effects. A
long-standing, but to date unproven, hypothesis is that this disadvantage is
equal to the fractional cost relative to the total resting metabolic
expenditure. This hypothesis has found a recent resurgence as a powerful tool
for quantitatively understanding the strength of selection among different
classes of organisms. Our work explores the validity of the hypothesis from
first principles through a generalized metabolic growth model, versions of
which have been successful in describing organismal growth from single cells to
higher animals. We build a mathematical framework to calculate how
perturbations in maintenance and synthesis costs translate into contributions
to the selection coefficient. This allows us to show that the hypothesis is an
approximation to the actual baseline selection coefficient. Moreover we can
derive the correct prefactor in its functional form, as well as analytical
bounds on its accuracy for any given realization of the model. We illustrate
our general framework using a special case of the growth model, which we show
provides a quantitative description of metabolic expenditures in data collected
from a wide array of unicellular organisms (both prokaryotes and eukaryotes).
In all these cases we demonstrate that the hypothesis is an excellent
approximation, allowing estimates of baseline selection coefficients to within
15% of their actual values. Even in a broader biological parameter range,
covering growth data from multicellular organisms, the hypothesis continues to
work well, always within an order of magnitude of the correct result. Our work
thus justifies its use as a versatile tool, setting the stage for its wider
deployment.

demand at the distribution level due to additional PEV charging demand. Our
proposed approach distributes computation among agents (PEVs) to solve the
PEV-CCP problem in a distributed fashion through an iterative interaction
between neighboring agents. The structure of each agent's update functions
ensures an agreement on a price signal while enforcing individual PEV
constraints. In addition to converging towards the globally-optimum solution,
our algorithm ensures the feasibility of each PEV's decision at each iteration.

However real world scenarios typically exhibit non i.i.d and dynamic structures
and are confined by physical constraints, preventing applicability of the
theoretical guarantees of compressed sensing and limiting its applications. In
this thesis we develop new theory, algorithms and applications for non i.i.d
and dynamic compressed sensing by considering such constraints. In the first
part of this thesis we derive new optimal sampling-complexity tradeoffs for two
commonly used processes used to model dependent temporal structures: the
autoregressive processes and self-exciting generalized linear models. Our
theoretical results successfully recovered the temporal dependencies in neural
activities, financial data and traffic data. Next, we develop a new framework
for studying temporal dynamics by introducing compressible state-space models,
which simultaneously utilize spatial and temporal sparsity. We develop a fast
algorithm for optimal inference on such models and prove its optimal recovery
guarantees. Our algorithm shows significant improvement in detecting sparse
events in biological applications such as spindle detection and calcium
deconvolution. Finally, we develop a sparse Poisson image reconstruction

communications standard (5G). The belief propagation (BP) decoder allows for
parallel decoding of polar codes, making it suitable for high throughput
applications. However, the error-correction performance of polar codes under BP
decoding is far from the requirements of 5G. It has been shown that the
error-correction performance of BP can be improved if the decoding is performed
on multiple permuted factor graphs of polar codes. However, a different BP
decoding scheduling is required for each factor graph permutation which results
in the design of a different decoder for each permutation. Moreover, the
selection of the different factor graph permutations is at random, which
prevents the decoder to achieve a desirable error-correction performance with a
small number of permutations. In this paper, we first show that the
permutations on the factor graph can be mapped into suitable permutations on
the codeword positions. As a result, we can make use of a single decoder for
all the permutations. In addition, we introduce a method to construct a set of
predetermined permutations which can provide the correct codeword if the
decoding fails on the original permutation. We show that for the 5G polar code
of length $1024$, the error-correction performance of the proposed decoder is
more than $0.25$ dB better than that of the BP decoder with the same number of
random permutations at the frame error rate of $10^{-4}$.

the use of bounded-degree fragments of the ""sum-of-squares"" logic as a

such fragments in polynomial-time. We propose to use such fragments to answer
queries about whether a given probability distribution satisfies a given system

very relevant scenario in which network-induced delay needs to be investigated
is costly usage of communication resources. More precisely, advanced
communication technologies, e.g. 5G, are capable of offering latency-varying
information exchange for different prices. Therefore, induced delay becomes a
decision variable. It is then the matter of decision maker's willingness to
either pay the required cost to have low-latency access to the communication
resource, or delay the access at a reduced price. In this article, we consider
optimal price-based bi-variable decision making problem for single-loop NCS
with a stochastic linear time-invariant system. Assuming that communication
incurs cost such that transmission with shorter delay is more costly, a
decision maker determines the switching strategy between communication links of
different delays such that an optimal balance between the control performance
and the communication cost is maintained. In this article, we show that, under
mild assumptions on the available information for decision makers, the
separation property holds between the optimal link selecting and control

(1) a discriminative network that learns a fixed-length representation from

individual profiles are usually non-Gaussian, harbouring line wings, multiple
components, and asymmetries. Given this spectral complexity, we quantify the
motions in the atomic ISM through moment analysis of the spectra and fits to
aligned, stacked profiles. The measured value of the HI line width depends
strongly on the method used, with the velocity stacked profiles aligned to the
peak velocity giving the minimum value of $\sigma = 7$ km s$^{-1}$ and all
other methods giving higher values ($\sigma\sim10$ km s$^{-1}$). All
measurements of the line width show a shallow radial trend, with $\sigma$
decreasing by $\sim2$ km s$^{-1}$ from $R_{\rm gal}=0$ to $R_{\rm gal}=8$ kpc.
We consider a number of energy sources that might maintain the line width
against turbulent dissipation, but no single source is adequate. We find excess
emission relative to a Gaussian in the stacked profile line wings, ranging from
9% to 26% depending on how the spectra are aligned. By splitting the line wings
into symmetric and asymmetric components, we find that the lagging rotational
disk accounts for one-third of the line wing flux. We also find emission far

resampling distributions formed from the single observed network, allowing for
finer and higher dimensional comparisons than simply point estimates of

utility of the model. On the other hand, establishing nonadditivity can be
useful in determining the need for individualized predictions and treatment
selection. Testing additivity of single covariates in nonparametric regression
models has been extensively studied. However, additivity assessment of
nonparametric functions of disjoint sets of variables has not received as much
attention. We propose a method for detection of nonadditivity of two disjoint
sets of variables by fitting the sum of two BART models, each using its own set
of variables. We then compare the pseudo marginal likelihood (PsML) of this
sum-of- BARTs model vs. a single-BART model with all the variables together, in
a ratio known as Pseudo Bayes Factor (PsBF). A special case of our method
checks additivity between one variable of interest and another set of
variables, where the additive model allows for direct interpretation of the
variable of interest while adjusting for the remaining variables in a flexible,
nonparametric manner. We extended the above approaches to allow a binary
response using a logit link. We also propose a systematic way to design
simulations that are used in additivity assessment. In simulation studies, PsBF
showed better performance compared to out-of-sample prediction error in
choosing the correct model, while avoiding computationally expensive
cross-validation and providing an interpretable criterion for model selection.
We applied our approach to two different examples with a continuous and binary
outcomes.

that quantum particles do not move along straight lines in free space by
increasing the probability of finding the particles within narrow intervals of
position and momentum beyond the ""either/or"" limit of 0.5 using constructive
quantum interference between a component localized in position and a component
localized in momentum. The probability of finding the particle in a
corresponding spatial interval at a later time then violates the lower bound of
the particle propagation inequality which is based on the validity of Newton's
first law. In this paper, the problem of localizing the two state components in
their respective target intervals is addressed by introducing a set of three
coefficients that describe the localization of arbitrary wavefunctions
quantitatively. This characterization is applied to a superposition of
Gaussians, obtaining a violation of the particle propagation inequality by more
than 5 percent if the width of the Gaussian wavefunction is optimized along
with the size of the position and momentum intervals. It is shown that the
violation of the particle propagation inequality originates from the
fundamental way in which quantum interferences relate initial position and
momentum to the future positions of a particle, indicating that the violation
is a fundamental feature of causality in the quantum limit.

Topological phase transition yields a state of matter intimately linked with
electron dynamics, as manifested via the chiral edge currents in topological
insulators. Does topological state of matter leave its mark on optical
tunneling and sub-cycle electronic response? We identify distinct topological
effects on the directionality and the attosecond timing of currents arising
during electron injection into conduction bands. We show that electrons tunnel
across the band gap differently in trivial and topological phases, for the same
band structure, and identify the key role of the Berry curvature in this
process. These effects map onto topologically-dependent attosecond delays in
high harmonic emission and the helicities of the emitted harmonics, which can
record the phase diagram of the system and its topological invariants. Thus,
the topological state of the system controls its attosecond, highly

that can be found in both elliptical and spiral galaxies. In this work we study
the kinematics of the globular cluster (GC) systems of three lenticular
galaxies located in low density environments (NGC 2768, NGC 3115 and NGC 7457),
and compare them with the kinematics of planetary nebulae (PNe). The PNe and GC
data come from the Planetary Nebulae Spectrograph and the SLUGGS Surveys.
Through photometric spheroid-disc decomposition and PNe kinematics we find the
probability for a given GC to belong to either the spheroid or the disc of its
host galaxy or be rejected from the model. We find that there is no correlation
between the components that the GCs are likely to belong to and their colours.
Particularly, for NGC 2768 we find that its red GCs display rotation
preferentially at inner radii (Re<1). In the case of the GC system of NGC 3115
we find a group of GCs with similar kinematics that are not likely to belong to
either its spheroid nor disc. For NGC 7457 we find that 70% of its GCs are
likely to belong to the disc. Overall, our results suggest that these galaxies
assembled into S0s through different evolutionary paths. Mergers seem to have
been very important for NGC 2768 and NGC 3115 while NGC 7457 is more likely to

short of its promise to allow users to quickly and naturally program robots.
Demonstrations are inherently ambiguous and incomplete, making correct
generalization to unseen situations difficult without a large number of
demonstrations in varying conditions. By contrast, humans are often able to
learn complex tasks from a single demonstration (typically observations without
action labels) by leveraging context learned over a lifetime. Inspired by this
capability, our goal is to enable robots to perform one-shot learning of
multi-step tasks from observation by leveraging auxiliary video data as
context. Our primary contribution is a novel system that achieves this goal by:
(1) using a single user-segmented demonstration to define the primitive actions
that comprise a task, (2) localizing additional examples of these actions in
unsegmented auxiliary videos via a metalearning-based approach, (3) using these
additional examples to learn a reward function for each action, and (4)
performing reinforcement learning on top of the inferred reward functions to
learn action policies that can be combined to accomplish the task. We
empirically demonstrate that a robot can learn multi-step tasks more
effectively when provided auxiliary video, and that performance greatly
improves when localizing individual actions, compared to learning from
unsegmented videos.

Specifically, we maintain a timely updated keymemory to keep track of attention

minimize the total UAVs energy consumption, including propulsion energy,
computation energy and communication energy, while ensuring that the total

of bits for computation, we propose a resource partitioning strategy where one
portion of tasks is migrated to TBS for computation and the other portion of
tasks is locally computed at UAV. For deeply comprehending the impacts of
access manners on the system performance, we consider four access schemes in
the uplink transmission, i.e., time division multiple access (TDMA), orthogonal
frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), One-by-One access and
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The problem of jointly optimizing bit
allocation, power allocation, resource partitioning as well as UAV trajectory
under TBS's energy budget is formulated and tackled by means of successive
convex approximation (SCA) technique. The numerical results show that the
proposed schemes save much energy compared with benchmark schemes.

literature, strain-induced out-of-plane deformations (occurring naturally or

produce separation of valley currents. Because valley filtering properties in
these structures is, however, highly dependent on the type of deformation and
setups considered, it is important to identify the relevant factors determining
optimal operation and detection of valley currents. In this paper we present a
comprehensive comparison of two typical deformations commonly found in graphene
samples: local centro-symmetric bubbles and extended folds/wrinkles. Using the
Dirac model for graphene and the second-order Born approximation we
characterize the scattering properties of the bubble deformation, while
numerical transmission matrix methods are used for the fold-like deformations.
In both cases, we obtain the dependence of valley polarization on the
geometrical parameters of deformations, and discuss their possible experimental
realizations. Our study reveals that extended deformations act as better valley
filters in broader energy ranges and present more robust features against
variations of geometrical parameters and incident current directions.

We investigate the thermal evolution of planetesimals to account for the
current abundances (known as the fall statistics) of petrologic types 3 - 6
ordinary chondrites. We carry out a number of numerical calculations in which
formation times and sizes of planetesimals are taken as parameters. We find
that planetesimals that form within 2.0 Myr after the formation of Ca-Al-rich
inclusions (CAIs) can contain all petrologic types of ordinary chondrites. Our
results also indicate that plausible scenarios of planetesimal formation, which
are consistent with the fall statistics, are that planetesimals with radii
larger than 60 km start to form around 2.0 Myr after CAIs and/or that ones with
radii less than 50 km should be formed within 1.5 Myr after CAIs. Thus, thermal
modelling of planetesimals is important for revealing the occurrence and amount

in an equilibrium that is common to many opinion dynamics models, including the
well-known DeGroot model.
  We develop a discrete optimization formulation for the problem of maximally
shifting the equilibrium opinions in a network by targeting users with stubborn
agents. The opinion objective functions we consider are the opinion mean, the
opinion variance, and the number of individuals whose opinion exceeds a fixed
threshold. We show that the mean opinion is a monotone submodular function,
allowing us to find a good solution using a greedy algorithm. We find that on
real social networks in Twitter consisting of tens of thousands of individuals,
a small number of stubborn agents can non-trivially influence the equilibrium
opinions. Furthermore, we show that our greedy algorithm outperforms several
common benchmarks.

versions of their opinions, communications are random, users grow more stubborn

prove that under fairly general conditions on the stubbornness rates of the

probability of reaching a rare goal state before a regeneration state in a

probability measure governing the Markov chain such that transitions `towards'
the goal state become more likely. To do this we need an idea of distance to
the goal state, so some level of knowledge of the Markov chain is required. In
this paper, we use graph analysis to obtain this knowledge. In particular, we
focus on knowledge of the shortest paths (in terms of `rare' transitions) to
the goal state. We show that only a subset of the (possibly huge) state space
needs to be considered. This is effective when the high dependability of the
system is primarily due to high component reliability, but less so when it is
due to high redundancies. For several models we compare our results to

specially for recognizing individual instances, even these instances are
collectively coming in batch. Recognizers in decision either reject or
categorize them to some known class using empirically-set threshold. Thus the
decision threshold plays a key role. However, the selection for it usually
depends on the knowledge of known classes, inevitably incurring risks due to
lacking available information from unknown classes. On the other hand, a more
realistic OSR system should NOT just rest on a reject decision but should go
further, especially for discovering the hidden unknown classes among the reject
instances, whereas existing OSR methods do not pay special attention. In this
paper, we introduce a novel collective/batch decision strategy with an aim to
extend existing OSR for new class discovery while considering correlations
among the testing instances. Specifically, a collective decision-based OSR
framework (CD-OSR) is proposed by slightly modifying the Hierarchical Dirichlet
process (HDP). Thanks to HDP, our CD-OSR does not need to define the decision
threshold and can implement the open set recognition and new class discovery
simultaneously. Finally, extensive experiments on benchmark datasets indicate
the validity of CD-OSR.

simultaneously capturing motion and temporal evolution information,
particularly in the context of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Compared with optical flow for motion characterization, dynamic imaging
exhibits superior efficiency and compactness. Inspired by the success of
dynamic imaging in RGB video, this study extends it to the depth domain. To
better exploit three-dimensional (3D) characteristics, multi-view dynamic
images are proposed. In particular, the raw depth video is densely projected
with respect to different virtual imaging viewpoints by rotating the virtual
camera within the 3D space. Subsequently, dynamic images are extracted from the
obtained multi-view depth videos and multi-view dynamic images are thus
constructed from these images. Accordingly, more view-tolerant visual cues can
be involved. A novel CNN model is then proposed to perform feature learning on
multi-view dynamic images. Particularly, the dynamic images from different
views share the same convolutional layers but correspond to different fully
connected layers. This is aimed at enhancing the tuning effectiveness on
shallow convolutional layers by alleviating the gradient vanishing problem.
Moreover, as the spatial occurrence variation of the actions may impair the
CNN, an action proposal approach is also put forth. In experiments, the
proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance on three challenging
datasets.

a density-wave-like electronic instability due to Fermi surface nesting (FSN)
and strong electron-phonon coupling. However, the ordering of other electronic
degrees of freedom can also occur simultaneously with the lattice distortion
thus challenges the aforementioned prevailing scenario. Recently, a hidden
electronic reconstruction beyond FSN was revealed in a layered metallic
compound BaTi2As2O below the structural transition temperature Ts ~ 200 K. The
nature of this hidden electronic instability is under strong debate. Here, by
measuring the local orbital polarization through 75As nuclear magnetic
resonance experiment, we observe a p-d bond order between Ti and As atoms in
BaTi2As2O single crystal. Below Ts, the bond order breaks both rotational and
translational symmetry of the lattice. Meanwhile, the spin-lattice relaxation
measurement indicates a substantial loss of density of states and an enhanced
spin fluctuation in the bond-order state. Further first-principles calculations
suggest that the mechanism of the bond order is due to the coupling of lattice

electronic reconstruction in BaTi2As2O and shed light on the mechanism of
superconductivity in this family.

system of sets of lengths of $H$ is the set $\mathcal{L}(H) = \{\mathsf{L}(x)

$\rho(x)$, is the quotient $\sup \mathsf{L}(x)/\inf \mathsf{L}(x)$ and the

system of sets of lengths and the elasticity of $H$ both measure how far is $H$
from being half-factorial, i.e., $|\mathsf{L}(x)| = 1$ for each $x \in H$.
  Let $\mathcal{C}$ denote the collection comprising all submonoids of
finite-rank free commutative monoids, and let $\mathcal{C}_d = \{H \in

construct for each $d \ge 2$ a monoid in $\mathcal{C}_d$ having extremal system
of sets of lengths. It has been proved before that the system of sets of
lengths does not characterize (up to isomorphism) monoids in $\mathcal{C}_1$.
Here we use our construction to extend this result to $\mathcal{C}_d$ for any
$d \ge 2$. On the other hand, it has been recently conjectured that the
elasticity of any monoid in $\mathcal{C}$ is either rational or infinite. We
conclude this paper by proving that this is indeed the case for monoids in

of the mutual friction to consider the vortex line density. A uniform mutual
friction parameter was assumed in the streamwise direction. Our simulation
showed that the entrance length of the normal fluid from a hot end becomes
shorter than that of a single normal fluid due to the mutual friction with the
parabolically developed superfluid flow near the hot end. As the mutual
friction increases, the entrance length decreases. Same as that, the entrance
length of the superfluid from a cold end is affected by the strength of the
mutual friction due to the parabolically developed normal fluid flow near the

tail-flattened flow is discussed by parameterizing the superfluid turbulent
eddy viscosity and the mutual friction.

combining the shifted Laplacian with approaches for linear elasticity. We
provide local Fourier analysis and numerical evidence that the convergence rate

With consensus leaning towards quasars producing a negligible amount of

contribute to reionization by allowing ionizing photons from stars to escape
more easily? Using the Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution model to evolve a galaxy
population through cosmic time, we construct an idealized scenario in which the
escape fraction of stellar ionizing photons ($f_\mathrm{esc}$) is boosted
following quasar wind events, potentially for several dynamical times. We find
that under this scenario, the mean value of $f_\mathrm{esc}$ as a function of
galaxy stellar mass peaks for intermediate mass galaxies. This mass dependence
will have consequences for the 21cm power spectrum, enhancing power at small

not directly contribute to the ionizing photon budget, they could influence
reionization indirectly by altering the topology of ionized regions.

by other methods, the symmetry was not broken and the calculated ground state

we have found that for the nickel $d^7$ state two configurations with an
electron on the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ or $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital have equal

clinical trials in oncology. This assumption not only affects the analysis part
but also the sample size calculation. The presence of delayed effects causes a
change in the hazard ratio while the trial is ongoing since at the beginning we
do not observe any difference between treatment arms and after some unknown
time point, the differences between treatment arms will start to appear. Hence,
the proportional hazards assumption no longer holds and both sample size
calculation and analysis methods to be used should be reconsidered. The
weighted log-rank test allows a weighting for early, middle and late
differences through the Fleming and Harrington class of weights, and is proven
to be more efficient when the proportional hazards assumption does not hold.
The Fleming and Harrington class of weights, along with the estimated delay,
can be incorporated into the sample size calculation in order to maintain the
desired power once the treatment arm differences start to appear. In this
article, we explore the impact of delayed effects in group sequential and
adaptive group sequential designs, and make an empirical evaluation in terms of
power and type-I error rate of the of the weighted log-rank test in a simulated
scenario with fixed values of the Fleming and Harrington class of weights. We
also give some practical recommendations regarding which methodology should be

solution is an action tree branching on sensing results. To support efficient

where the Sun has approached two strong reference radio sources 0229+131 and
0235+164 at an elongation angle of 1-3 degrees.
  Methods. The AUA020 VLBI session of 1 May 2017 was designed to obtain more

effectively calibrated with the dual-frequency observations even at small

global analyses of thousands of standard geodetic sessions over decades.

attracted a lot of research interest recently. For a good error-correcting
performance, list successive-cancellation decoding (LSCD) with large list size
is used to decode polar codes. However, as the complexity and delay of the list
management operation rapidly increase with the list size, the overall latency
of LSCD becomes large and limits the applicability of polar codes in
high-throughput and latency-sensitive applications. Therefore, in this work,
the low-latency implementation for LSCD with large list size is studied.
Specifically, at the system level, a selective expansion method is proposed
such that some of the reliable bits are not expanded to reduce the computation
and latency. At the algorithmic level, a double thresholding scheme is proposed
as a fast approximate-sorting method for the list management operation to
reduce the LSCD latency for large list size. A VLSI architecture of the LSCD
implementing the selective expansion and double thresholding scheme is then
developed, and implemented using a UMC 90 nm CMOS technology. Experimental
results show that, even for a large list size of 16, the proposed LSCD achieves
a decoding throughput of 460 Mbps at a clock frequency of 658 MHz.

description of mixing in turbulent stratified fluids. The dominant paradigm is
that it converts APE into background gravitational potential energy ${\rm
GPE}_r$, and that the APE thus converted can be infinitely recycled back into
APE by external buoyancy fluxes such as high-latitude cooling in the oceans. In
this paper, we argue that such a paradigm is unphysical, because its corollary
is that APE dissipation is neither truly dissipative nor irreversible, while
also violating energy conservation in more subtle ways. In this paper, we prove
from first principles that in reality, APE dissipation is a form of Joule
heating, which --- like viscous dissipation --- can only increase ${\rm GPE}_r$
via locally expanding the fluid parcels, a tiny effect. ${\rm GPE}_r$ thus
primarily increases at the expense of the exergy of the stratification, a
subcomponent of the background internal energy, regardless of whether the flow
is laminar or turbulent. The results greatly clarify the energetics of
mechanically- and buoyancy-driven circulations. As a side benefit, our results
yield a new physical principle justifying why turbulent mixing tends to
homogenise the fluid's materially conserved variables rather than relax the
fluid towards thermodynamic equilibrium.

environmental conditions such as those caused by weathers, seasons, and
day-night cycles. We excavate and memorize the stable semantic structure of
different places and scenes. For example, we can recognize tree whether the
bare tree in winter or lush tree in summer. Therefore, the intrinsic features
that are corresponding to specific semantic contents and condition-invariant of
appearance changes can be employed to improve the performance of long-term
place recognition significantly.
  In this paper, we propose a novel intrinsic encoder that excavates the
condition-invariant latent space of different places under drastic appearance
changes. Our method excavates the space of intrinsic structure and semantic
information by proposed self-supervised encoder loss. Different from previous
learning based place recognition methods that need paired training data of each
place with appearance changes, we employ the weakly-supervised strategy to
utilize unpaired set-based training data of different environmental conditions.
  We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that our semi-supervised
intrinsic encoder achieves remarkable performance for place recognition under
drastic appearance changes. The proposed intrinsic encoder outperforms the
state-of-the-art image-level place recognition methods on standard benchmark
Nordland.

Telescopes (SSTs; 4 m diameter mirror) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).
The SSTs are focused on very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray detection via atmospheric
Cherenkov light detection over a very large area. This implies many individual
units and hence cost-effective implementation. CHEC relies on dual-mirror
optics to reduce the plate-scale and make use of 6 $\times$ 6 mm$^2$ pixels,
leading to a low-cost ($\sim$150 kEuro), compact (0.5 m $\times$ 0.5 m), and
light ($\sim$45 kg) camera with 2048 pixels providing a camera FoV of $\sim$9
degrees. The electronics are based on custom TARGET (TeV array readout with
GSa/s sampling and event trigger) ASICs and FPGAs sampling incoming signals at
a gigasample per second, with flexible camera-level triggering within a single
backplane FPGA. CHEC is designed to observe in the $\gamma$-ray energy range of
1$-$300 TeV, and at impact distances up to $\sim$500 m. To accommodate this and
provide full flexibility for later data analysis, full waveforms with 96
samples for all 2048 pixels can be read out at rates up to $\sim$900 Hz. The
first prototype, CHEC-M, based on multi-anode photomultipliers (MAPMs) as
photosensors, was commissioned and characterised in the laboratory and during
two measurement campaigns on a telescope structure at the Paris Observatory in
Meudon. In this paper, the results and conclusions from the laboratory and
on-site testing of CHEC-M are presented. They have provided essential input on
the system design and on operational and data analysis procedures for a camera
of this type. A second full-camera prototype based on Silicon photomultipliers
(SiPMs), addressing the drawbacks of CHEC-M identified during the first
prototype phase, has already been built and is currently being commissioned and
tested in the laboratory.

  The first part of the work on models of set theory consists in establishing a
refined version of Friedman's theorem on the existence of embeddings between
countable non-standard models of a fragment of ZF, and an analogue of a theorem
of Gaifman to the effect that certain countable models of set theory can be
elementarily end-extended to a model with many automorphisms whose sets of
fixed points equal the original model. The second part of the work on set
theory consists in combining these two results into a technical machinery,
yielding several results about non-standard models of set theory relating such
notions as self-embeddings, their sets of fixed points, strong rank-cuts, and
set theories of different strengths.
  The work in foundational category theory consists in the formulation of a
novel algebraic set theory which is proved to be equiconsistent to New
Foundations (NF), and which can be modulated to correspond to intuitionistic or
classical NF, with or without atoms. A key axiom of this theory expresses that
its structures have an endofunctor with natural properties.

falling in $[0,1]$. This distance plays a fundamental role in machine learning
and signal processing: It is a member of the broader class of $f$-divergences,
and it is related to the probability of error in Bayesian hypothesis testing.
Since the total variation distance does not admit closed-form expressions for
statistical mixtures (like Gaussian mixture models), one often has to rely in
practice on costly numerical integrations or on fast Monte Carlo approximations
that however do not guarantee deterministic lower and upper bounds. In this
work, we consider two methods for bounding the total variation of univariate
mixture models: The first method is based on the information monotonicity
property of the total variation to design guaranteed nested deterministic lower
bounds. The second method relies on computing the geometric lower and upper
envelopes of weighted mixture components to derive deterministic bounds based
on density ratio. We demonstrate the tightness of our bounds in a series of

$K\le K_\text{max}$ it is possible to obtain accurate elastic and inelastic
cross sections for He+CaH, Li+CaH and Li+SrOH collisions at a small fraction of
the computational cost of the full coupled-channel calculations (where $K$ is
the projection of the molecular rotational angular momentum on the atom-diatom

mechanism of the inelastic process and on the magnitude of the external
magnetic field. For dipolar-mediated spin relaxation in ultracold Li+CaH and
Li+SrOH collisions, we find that a minimal helicity basis set
($K_\text{max}=0$) gives quantitatively accurate results at ultralow collision

to predict turbulent flows with reasonable computational time and accuracy,
these equations are spatially filtered according to the large-eddy simulation
(LES) approach. The current work applies a volume filtering procedure according
to Schumann (1975). To demonstrate the procedure the Schumann filter is first
applied to a convection-diffusion equation. The Schumann filter results in
volume-averaged equations, which are not closed. To close these equations a
model is introduced, which represents the interaction between the resolved
scales and the small subgrid scales. Here, the anisotropic minimum-dissipation
model of Rozema et al. (2015) is considered. The interpolation scheme necessary
to evaluate the convective flux at the cell faces can be viewed as a second
filter. Thus, the convection term of the filtered convection-diffusion equation
can be interpreted as a double-filtered term. This term is approximated by the
scale similarity model of Bardina et al. (1983). Thus, a mixed
minimum-dissipation-Bardina model is obtained. Secondly, the mathematical
methodology is extended to the Navier-Stokes equations. Here, the pressure term
is analyzed separately and added to the convection-diffusion equation as a sink
term. Finally, spatially filtered Navier-Stokes equations that depend on both
the anisotropic minimum-dissipation (AMD) model proposed by Rozema et al.
(2015) and the scale similarity model of Bardina et al. (1983) are obtained.

arrays, a closed-form mathematical model of the antenna response, like a
steering vector, is not straightforward to define for MMAs. Instead one has to
rely on calibration measurement or electromagnetic field (EMF) simulation data,
which is discrete. To perform DoA estimation, array interpolation technique
(AIT) and wavefield modeling (WM) are suggested as methods with inherent
interpolation capabilities, fully taking antenna nonidealities like mutual
coupling into account. We present a non-coherent DoA estimator for low-cost
receivers and show how coherent DoA estimation and joint DoA and polarization

Here we show that individual all-dielectric nanostructures, with rational

exceeding 3 orders of magnitude. Such a striking effect is demonstrated within
a Si nanodisk by fully exploiting anapole generation and simultaneously
introducing a slot area with high-contrast interfaces. By performing
finite-difference time-domain simulations and multipole decomposition analysis,
we systematically investigate both far-field and near-field properties of the
slotted disk and reveal a subtle interplay among different resonant modes of
the system. Furthermore, while electric fields at anapole modes are typically
internal, i.e., found inside nanostructures, our slotted configuration
generates external hotspots with electric fields additionally enhanced by
virtue of boundary conditions. These electric hotspots are thereby directly
accessible to nearby molecules or quantum emitters, opening up new
possibilities for single-particle enhanced spectroscopies or single-photon
emission enhancement due to large Purcell effects. Our presented design

with those of the $T=3/2$ isobaric analog states (IAS) in $^{29}$P, $^{29}$Si,
and $^{29}$Al, fit well into the quadratic form of the Isobaric Multiplet Mass
Equation IMME. The mass excess of $^{27}$P has been remeasured to be
$ME(^{27}$P$)=-685(42)$ keV. By analyzing the linear and quadratic coefficients
of the IMME in the $T_z=-3/2$ $sd$-shell nuclei, it was found that the ratio of
the Coulomb radius parameters is $R\approx0.96$ and is nearly the same for all
$T=3/2$ isospin multiplets. Such a nearly constant $R$-value, apparently valid
for the entire light mass region with $A>9$, can be used to set stringent
constraints on the isovector and isotensor components of the isospin
non-conserving forces in theoretical calculations.

especially true when data exhibits strong dependencies and single measurements
need to be assessed and analyzed in their respective context. In this work, we
consider scenarios where measurements are non-i.i.d, i.e. where samples are
dependent on corresponding discrete latent variables which are connected
through some given dependency structure, the contextual information. Our
contribution is twofold: (i) Building atop of support vector data description
(SVDD), we derive a method able to cope with latent-class dependency structure
that can still be optimized efficiently. We further show that our approach
neatly generalizes vanilla SVDD as well as k-means and conditional random
fields (CRF) and provide a corresponding probabilistic interpretation. (ii) In
unsupervised scenarios where it is not possible to quantify the accuracy of an
anomaly detector, having an human-interpretable solution is the key to success.
Based on deep Taylor decomposition and a reformulation of our trained anomaly
detector as a neural network, we are able to backpropagate predictions to
pixel-domain and thus identify features and regions of high relevance. We
demonstrate the usefulness of our novel approach on toy data with known
spatio-temporal structure and successfully validate on synthetic as well as
real world off-shore data from the oil industry.

the kinetic term of the radion during the inflationary epoch exhibits a
phantom-like behavior and the dynamical evolution of the radion field to its
stable value marks the exit from the phantom phase as well as the inflationary
era simultaneously. We show that the amalgamation and synergy of the radion
potential along with its kinetic term can not only trigger the inflationary
scenario but also provide a successful exit from the same while maintaining
concordance with current observation.

paper, we begin our analysis of human cognition via formal methods and proceed
towards quantum theories. Human cognition often violate classic probabilities
on which formal representation of conceptual spaces are built. Further,
geometric representation of conceptual spaces proposed by Gardenfors discusses
the underlying content but lacks a systematic approach (Gardenfors, 2000; Kitto

different perspective with a gap towards sufficient understanding of human

relatively complex scenario can be addressed by vector space approach of
conceptual spaces as discussed in literature. In this research, we have
proposed an approach that uses both formal representation and Gardenfors
geometric approach. The proposed model of high dimensional formal
representation of conceptual space is mathematically analysed and inferred to
exhibit quantum aspects. Also, the proposed model achieves cognition, in

capturing novel physiological information that may indicate signs of fetal
distress. However, significant deterioration in NI-FECG signal quality occurs
during the presence of a highly non-conductive layer known as vernix caseosa
which forms on the fetal body surface beginning in approximately the 28th week
of gestation. This work investigates asymmetric modeling of vernix caseosa and
other maternal-fetal tissues in accordance with clinical observations and
assesses their impacts for NI-FECG signal processing. Methods: We develop a
process for simulating dynamic maternal-fetal abdominal ECG mixtures using a
synthetic cardiac source model embedded in a finite element volume conductor.
Using this process, changes in NI-FECG signal morphology are assessed in an
extensive set of finite element models including spatially variable
distributions of vernix caseosa. Results: Our simulations show that volume
conductor asymmetry can result in over 70% error in the observed T/QRS ratio
and significant changes to signal morphology compared to a homogeneous volume
conductor model. Conclusion: Volume conductor effects must be considered when
analyzing T/QRS ratios obtained via NI-FECG and should be considered in future
algorithm benchmarks using simulated data. Significance: This work shows that
without knowledge of the influence of volume conductor effects, clinical
evaluation of the T/QRS ratio derived via NI-FECG should be avoided.

flows of classical viscous fluids but also in flows of quantum fluids such as
superfluid $^4$He. Despite the established similarity between turbulence in
classical fluids and quasi-classical turbulence in superfluid $^4$He, it has
been predicted that intermittency in superfluid $^4$He is temperature dependent
and enhanced for certain temperatures, which strikingly contrasts the nearly
flow-independent intermittency in classical turbulence. Experimental
verification of this theoretical prediction is challenging since it requires
well-controlled generation of quantum turbulence in $^4$He and flow measurement
tools with high spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we report an
experimental study of quantum turbulence generated by towing a grid through a
stationary sample of superfluid $^4$He. The decaying turbulent quantum flow is
probed by combining a recently developed He$^*_2$ molecular tracer-line tagging
velocimetry technique and a traditional second sound attenuation method. We
observe quasi-classical decays of turbulent kinetic energy in the normal fluid

instants during the decay, we calculate the transverse velocity structure

detected in radio and has been confirmed in X-rays based on Chandra
observations. An X-ray point source CXOUJ181852.0-150213 has been detected and
suggested to be an associated neutron star. In a recent study, we have
confirmed the source to be a central compact object (CCO). We have studied the
SNR using high-resolution X-ray data taken with Chandra in combination with
infrared (IR) data in order to understand its emission and to derive its
physical parameters. This will also help to constrain, e.g., the age of the CCO
and the environment in which it was born. The spectral analysis of the X-ray
emission using the new Chandra data and the comparison to the IR data have
shown that the SNR is relatively young with an age of a few thousand years and
that its emission is dominated by that of shocked interstellar medium (ISM).
However, the analysis of the spectrum of the bright eastern shell shows that
there is an additional emission component with enhanced abundances of {\alpha}
elements and Fe, suggesting ejecta emission. The multi-wavelength emission is
consistent with SNR G15.9+0.2 expanding in an ISM with a density gradient,
while there is also colder material located in front of the SNR, which absorbs
its thermal X-ray emission in the softer bands.

allow in the near future to observe the GW signal of a nearby core-collapse
supernova. For the most common type of progenitors, likely with slowly rotating
cores, the dominant GW emission mechanisms are the post-bounce oscillations of
the proto-neutron star (PNS) before the explosion. We present a new procedure
to compute the eigenmodes of the system formed by the PNS and the stalled
accretion shock in general relativity including spacetime perturbations. The
new method improves on previous results by accounting for perturbations of both
the lapse function and the conformal factor. We apply our analysis to two
numerical core-collapse simulations and show that our improved method is able
to obtain eigenfrequencies that accurately match the features observed in the
GW signal and to predict the qualitative behaviour of quasi-radial
oscillations. Our analysis is possible thanks to a newly developed algorithm to
classify the computed eigenmodes in different classes (f-, p-, and g-modes),
improving previous results which suffered from misclassification issues. We
find that most of the GW energy is stored in the lowest order eigenmodes, in
particular in the $^2g_1$ mode and in the $^2f$ mode. Our results also suggest
that a low-frequency component of the GW signal attributed in previous works to
the characteristic frequency of the Standing Accretion Shock Instability should
be identified as the fundamental quadrupolar f-mode. We also develop a
formalism to estimate the contribution of quasi-radial ($l=0$) modes to the
quadrupolar component of the GW emission in the case of a deformed background,
with application to rapidly rotating cores. This work provides further support
for asteroseismology of core-collapse supernovae and the inference of PNS
properties based on GW observations.

Manual animal censuses are dangerous and expensive, hence Unmanned Aerial

alternative tool to estimate livestock. Several works have been proposed that
semi-automatically process UAV images to detect animals, of which some employ
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a recent family of deep learning
algorithms that proved very effective in object detection in large datasets
from computer vision. However, the majority of works related to wildlife
focuses only on small datasets (typically subsets of UAV campaigns), which
might be detrimental when presented with the sheer scale of real study areas
for large mammal census. Methods may yield thousands of false alarms in such
cases. In this paper, we study how to scale CNNs to large wildlife census tasks
and present a number of recommendations to train a CNN on a large UAV dataset.
We further introduce novel evaluation protocols that are tailored to censuses
and model suitability for subsequent human verification of detections. Using
our recommendations, we are able to train a CNN reducing the number of false
positives by an order of magnitude compared to previous state-of-the-art.
Setting the requirements at 90% recall, our CNN allows to reduce the amount of

for rangers to screen all the data acquired efficiently and to detect almost
all animals in the reserve automatically.

which can be used as biocatalysts. High activity of proteins reduces the cost
of biocatalysts. A model that can predict protein activity from amino acid
sequence is highly desired, as it aids experimental improvement of proteins.
However, only limited data for protein activity are currently available, which
prevents the development of such models. Since protein activity and solubility
are correlated for some proteins, the publicly available solubility dataset may
be adopted to develop models that can predict protein solubility from sequence.
The models could serve as a tool to indirectly predict protein activity from
sequence. In literature, predicting protein solubility from sequence has been
intensively explored, but the predicted solubility represented in binary values
from all the developed models was not suitable for guiding experimental designs
to improve protein solubility. Here we propose new machine learning models for
improving protein solubility in vivo. We first implemented a novel approach
that predicted protein solubility in continuous numerical values instead of
binary ones. After combing it with various machine learning algorithms, we
achieved a prediction accuracy of 76.28 percent when Support Vector Machine
algorithm was used. Continuous values of solubility are more meaningful in
protein engineering, as they enable researchers to choose proteins with higher
predicted solubility for experimental validation, while binary values fail to
distinguish proteins with the same value. There are only two possible values so
many proteins have the same one.

Strongly attractive systems undergo a continuous transition in which rigid

Purely repulsive and weakly attractive systems jam via a first order
transition, with no growing cluster size. We further show that the weakly

Despite these insights, such analyses have also occasionally triggered debates
which spill over many disciplines, from genetics, to biology, or demography.
Perhaps the hottest discussion is happening around the question of maximum
human lifespan, which --besides its fascinating historical and philosophical
interest-- poses urgent pragmatic warnings on a number of issues in public and
private decision-making. In this paper, we add to the controversy some results
which, based on purely statistical grounds, suggest that the maximum human
lifespan is not fixed, or has not reached yet a plateau. Quite the contrary,
analysis on reliable data for over 150 years in more than 20 industrialized
countries point at a sustained increase in the maximum age at death.
Furthermore, were this trend to continue, a limitless lifespan could be
achieved by 2102. Finally, we quantify the dependence of increases in the
maximum lifespan on socio-economic factors. Our analysis indicates that in some
countries the observed rising patterns can only be sustained by progressively
larger increases in GDP, setting the problem of longevity in a context of
diminishing returns.

with large parameter sets are often required. However, estimating a large
number of parameters is often infeasible due to the computational and memory
costs of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We introduce the class of
marginally parametrized (MP) models, where inference can be performed
efficiently with a sequence of marginal (estimated) likelihood functions via
stepwise maximum likelihood estimation (SMLE). We provide the conditions under
which the stepwise estimators are consistent, and we prove that this class of
models includes the diagonal vector autoregressive moving average model. We
demonstrate that the parameters of this model can be obtained at least three
orders of magnitude faster using SMLE compared to MLE, with only a small loss
in statistical efficiency. We apply an MP model to a spatio-temporal global
climate data set (in order to learn complex features of interest to climate
scientists) consisting of over five million data points, and we demonstrate how
estimation can be performed in less than an hour on a laptop.

up-regulated genes for cancer to the ranking of academic statistics journals.
Complications can arise when rankers do not report a full ranking of all
entities; for example, they might only report their top--$M$ ranked entities
after seeing some or all entities. It can also be useful to know whether
rankers are equally informative, and whether some entities are effectively
judged to be exchangeable. When there is important subgroup structure in the
data, summaries such as aggregate (overall) rankings can be misleading. In this
paper we propose a flexible Bayesian nonparametric model for identifying
heterogeneous structure and ranker reliability in ranked data. The model is a
Weighted Adapted Nested Dirichlet (WAND) process mixture of Plackett-Luce
models and inference proceeds through a simple and efficient Gibbs sampling
scheme for posterior sampling. The richness of information in the posterior
distribution allows us to infer many details of the structure both between
ranker groups and between entity groups (within ranker groups), in contrast to
many other (Bayesian) analyses. We also examine how posterior predictive checks
can be used to identify lack of model fit. The methodology is illustrated using
several simulation studies and real data examples.

supernova remnants (SNR). In the post-adiabatic stage the magnetic field has an
important and significant dynamical effect on the shock dynamics, the flow
structure, and hence the acceleration and emission of cosmic rays. We find that
the tangential component of the magnetic field provides pressure support that
to a fair degree prevents the collapse of the radiative shell and thus limits
the total compression ratio of the partially or fully radiative forward shock.
A consequence is that the spectra of cosmic rays would not be as hard as in
hydrodynamic simulations. We also investigated the effect on the flow profiles
of the magnetic-field inclination and a large-scale gradient in the gas density
and/or the magnetic field. A positive density gradient shortens the
evolutionary stages whereas a shock obliquity lowers the shock compression. The
compression of the tangential component of the magnetic field leads to its
dominance in the downstream region of post-adiabatic shocks for a wide range of
orientation of the upstream field, which may explain why one preferentially
observes tangential radio polarization in old SNRs. As most cosmic rays are
produced at late stages of SNR evolution, the post-adiabatic phase and the
influence of the magnetic field during it are most important for modeling the
cosmic-ray acceleration at old SNRs and the gamma-ray emission from late-stage
SNRs interacting with clouds.

different methods are available for many members of the class. Here we
summarize all distance estimates published in the literature for a sample of
Galactic X-ray pulsars, and compare them with direct distance measurements
obtained by the Gaia mission. We conclude that the spread of distance values
obtained for individual objects by the different conventional methods is
usually larger than one might expect from the quoted individual uncertainties,
such that Gaia values are in many cases a very useful additional information.
For distances larger than 5 kpc, however, the uncertainties of all distance
estimates (including those of Gaia) remain comparatively large, so conventional
methods will likely retain their importance. We provide, therefore, an
aposteriori estimate of the systematic uncertainty for each method based on the
comparison with the more accurate Gaia distance measurements.

has been observed in literature that such nonlinear reduced-order models (ROMs)
based on Galerkin projection sometimes exhibit much larger stable time step
sizes than their unreduced counterparts. This work provides a detailed
theoretical analysis of this phenomenon for structural mechanics. We first show
that many desirable system matrix properties are preserved by the Galerkin
projection. Next, we prove that the eigenvalues of the linearized Galerkin
reduced-order system separate the eigenvalues of the linearized original
system. Assuming non-negative Rayleigh damping and a time integration using the
popular central difference method, we further prove that the theoretical linear
stability time step of the ROM is in fact always larger than or equal to the
critical time step of its corresponding full-order model. We also give
mathematical expressions for computing the stable time step size. Finally, we
show that under certain conditions this increase in the stability time step
even extends to some hyper-reduction methods. The findings can be used to
compute numerical stability time step sizes for the integration of nonlinear
ROMs in structural mechanics, and to speed up simulations by permitting the use

generality one of the three `universality' classes of bootstrap percolation

`critical densities' serving the role of `difficulties' for critical models,
but adapted to subcritical ones. We characterise the critical probability in
terms of these quantities and successfully apply this link to prove new and old
results for concrete models such as DTBP and Spiral as well as a general
non-trivial upper bound. Our approach establishes and exploits a tight
connection between subcritical bootstrap percolation and a suitable
generalisation of classical oriented percolation, which will undoubtedly be the
source of more results and could provide an entry point for general
percolationists to bootstrap percolation.
  Furthermore, we prove that above a certain critical probability there is
exponential decay of the probability of a one-arm event, while below it the
event has positive probability and the expected infection time is infinite. We
also identify this as the transition of the spectral gap and mean infection
time of the corresponding kinetically constrained model. Finally, we
essentially characterise the noise sensitivity properties at fixed density for
the two natural one-arm events.

evidence that for a class of metallic compounds (known as triple point
topological metals), the points in the phonon spectrum, at which three (two
optical and one acoustic) phonon modes (bands) cross, represent a well-defined
topological material phase, in which the hosting metals have very strong
thermoelectric response. The triple point bosonic collective excitations
appearing due to these topological phonon band-crossing points significantly
suppress the lattice thermal conductivity, making such metals phonon-glass
like. At the same time, the topological triple-point and Weyl fermionic
quasiparticle excitations present in these metals yield good electrical
transport (electron-crystal) and cause a local enhancement in the electronic
density of states near the Fermi level, which considerably improves the
thermopower. This combination of ""phonon-glass"" and ""electron-crystal"" is the
key for high thermoelectric performance in metals. We call these materials
topological thermoelectric metals and propose several newly predicted compounds

interact with devices. Commercially available gesture recognition systems are
usually pre-trained and offer no option for customization by the user. In order
to improve the user experience, it is desirable to allow end users to define
their own gestures. This scenario requires learning from just a few training
examples if we want to impose only a light training load on the user. To this
end, we propose a gesture classifier based on a hierarchical probabilistic
modeling approach. In this framework, high-level features that are shared among
different gestures can be extracted from a large labeled data set, yielding a
prior distribution for gestures. When learning new types of gestures, the
learned shared prior reduces the number of required training examples for
individual gestures. We implemented the proposed gesture classifier for a Myo
sensor bracelet and show favorable results for the tested system on a database
of 17 different gesture types. Furthermore, we propose and implement two
methods to incorporate the gesture classifier in a real-time gesture
recognition system.

argue here that perturbative predictions about evolution for very long times

couplings come systematically together with growing functions of time. Such
growth signals a breakdown of naive perturbative calculations of late-time
behaviour, regardless of how small ambient curvatures might be. Similar issues
of secular growth also arise in cosmology, and we build evidence for the case
that such effects should be generic for gravitational fields. In particular,
inferences using free fields coupled only to background metrics can be
misleading at very late times due to the implicit assumption they make of
perturbation theory when neglecting other interactions. Using the Rindler
horizon as an example we show how this secular growth parallels similar
phenomena for thermal systems, and how it can be resummed to allow late-time
inferences to be drawn more robustly. Some comments are made about the
appearance of an IR/UV interplay in this calculation, as well as on the
possible relevance of our calculations to predictions near black-hole horizons.

the suppressed DOS exhibits the energy dependence $\propto \sqrt {|E-E_F|}$

is due to the exchange part of the electron self-energy. We derive the
states-conserving DOS heuristically. Namely, we show that the self-energy
consists of a diverging part (which we skip on physical grounds) and of the
small part of the order of the pair Coulomb energy. This small part gives the

techniques when the structure of the individual clusters is non-convex or

little theory about performance guarantees for spectral clustering. This issue
is partly due to the fact that spectral clustering typically involves two steps
which complicated its theoretical analysis: first, the eigenvectors of the
associated graph Laplacian are used to embed the dataset, and second, k-means
clustering algorithm is applied to the embedded dataset to get the labels. This
paper is devoted to the theoretical foundations of spectral clustering and
graph cuts. We consider a convex relaxation of graph cuts, namely ratio cuts
and normalized cuts, that makes the usual two-step approach of spectral
clustering obsolete and at the same time gives rise to a rigorous theoretical
analysis of graph cuts and spectral clustering. We derive deterministic bounds
for successful spectral clustering via a spectral proximity condition that
naturally depends on the algebraic connectivity of each cluster and the
inter-cluster connectivity. Moreover, we demonstrate by means of some popular
examples that our bounds can achieve near-optimality. Our findings are also
fundamental for the theoretical understanding of kernel k-means. Numerical

performing approach our network has similar accuracy but a much lower
complexity (about 6% of parameters) enabling to infer a depth map for a KITTI

in the field of marketing. In particular, we analyze how GAN models can
replicate text patterns from successful product listings on Airbnb, a
peer-to-peer online market for short-term apartment rentals. To do so, we
define the Diehl-Martinez-Kamalu (DMK) loss function as a new class of
functions that forces the model's generated output to include a set of
user-defined keywords. This allows the general adversarial network to recommend
a way of rewording the phrasing of a listing description to increase the
likelihood that it is booked. Although we tailor our analysis to Airbnb data,
we believe this framework establishes a more general model for how generative
algorithms can be used to produce text samples for the purposes of marketing.

slow slip. We consider the problem of slip on a fault that lies within an
elastic continuum and whose strength is proportional to sliding rate. This rate
dependence may correspond to a viscously deforming shear zone or the
linearization of a non-linear, rate-dependent fault strength. We examine the
response of such a fault to external forcing, such as local increases in shear
stress or pore fluid pressure. We show that the slip and slip rate are governed
by a type of diffusion equation, the solution of which is found using a Green's
function approach. We derive the long-time, self-similar asymptotic expansion
for slip or slip rate, which depend on both time $t$ and a similarity
coordinate $\eta=x/t$, where $x$ denotes fault position. The similarity
coordinate shows a departure from classical diffusion and is owed to the
non-local nature of elastic interaction among points on an interface between
elastic half-spaces. We demonstrate the solution and asymptotic analysis of
several example problems. Following sudden impositions of loading, we show that
slip rate ultimately decays as $1/t$ while spreading proportionally to $t$,
implying both a logarithmic accumulation of displacement as well as a constant
moment rate. We discuss the implication for models of post-seismic slip as well
as spontaneously emerging slow slip events.

of its high X-ray luminosity ($(2$$-$$4)\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and its
spectral/temporal features, a closer inspection shows that its properties are
more similar to those of a typical super-Eddington accreting stellar black hole
and we classify it as a `broadened disc' ultraluminous X-ray source. Based on
the physical interpretation of this spectral state, we suggest that ULX-1 is
seen at small inclination angles, possibly through the evacuated cone of a
powerful wind originating in the accretion disc. The spectral classification of
ULX-2 is less certain, but we disfavour an IMBH accreting at sub-Eddington
rates as none of its spectral/temporal properties can be associated to either
the soft or hard state of Galactic accreting black hole binaries.

With the addition of the nonlinear terms the number of regular solutions
becomes finite. As well, beyond critical values of the coupling constants we
find that there exist \emph{no} regular solutions. These behaviors are
asymmetric with respect to the sign of the nonlinear coupling constants and the
elimination of regular solutions turns out to be extremely sensitive to the
presence of the cubic coupling. It may be possible, therefore, that with
sufficiently high powers of torsion in the action, there may be no regular

unequivocally that the optical-gap energy of c-BN slightly exceeds 10 eV.
Further theoretical analysis in the framework of the Bethe-Salpeter equation of
many-body perturbation theory supports this result. The spatial localization of
defect-related emissions has been investigated using nanometric resolved
cathodoluminescence (nano-CL) in a STEM. By high-temperature annealing a c-BN
powder, we have promoted phase transitions in nanometric domains which have
been detected by the appearance of specific hexagonal-phase signatures in both
EELS and CL spectra. A high number of intragap optically active centers are
known in c-BN, but the literature is rather scattered and hence has been
summarized here. For several emission lines we have obtained nano-CL maps which
show emission spot sizes as small as few tens of nanometers. Finally, by
coupling nano-CL to a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss intensity interferometer, we have
addressed individual spots in order to identify the possible presence of
single-photon sources. The observed CL bunching effect is compatible with a
limited set of single-photon emitters and it permits obtaining emission

remote sensing data. How to manage such richness leveraging its complementarity
is a crucial chal- lenge in modern remote sensing analysis. Data Fusion
techniques deal with this point proposing method to combine and exploit
complementarity among the different data sensors. Considering optical Very High
Spatial Resolution (VHSR) images, satellites obtain both Multi Spectral (MS)
and panchro- matic (PAN) images at different spatial resolution. VHSR images
are extensively exploited to produce land cover maps to deal with agricultural,
ecological, and socioeconomic issues as well as assessing ecosystem status,
monitoring biodiversity and provid- ing inputs to conceive food risk monitoring
systems. Common techniques to produce land cover maps from such VHSR images
typically opt for a prior pansharpening of the multi-resolution source for a
full resolution processing. Here, we propose a new deep learning architecture
to jointly use PAN and MS imagery for a direct classification without any prior
image fusion or resampling process. By managing the spectral information at its
native spatial resolution, our method, named MRFusion, aims at avoiding the
possible infor- mation loss induced by pansharpening or any other hand-crafted
preprocessing. Moreover, the proposed architecture is suitably designed to
learn non-linear transformations of the sources with the explicit aim of taking
as much as possible advantage of the complementarity of PAN and MS imagery.
Experiments are carried out on two-real world scenarios depicting large areas
with different land cover characteristics. The characteristics of the proposed
scenarios underline the applicability and the generality of our method in
operational settings.

investigate a means of reducing impact forces on rigid spheres by making a jet

water jet accelerates the pool liquid and forms a cavity into which a sphere
falls. Through on-board accelerometer measurements and high speed imaging, we
quantify the force reduction compared to the case of a sphere entering a

dynamics because their accuracy increases spectrally in smooth solutions with
the order of the approximation. However, their main drawback is that increasing
the order also increases the computational cost. Several techniques have been
introduced in the past to reduce this cost. On the one hand, local mesh
adaptation strategies based on error estimation have been proposed to reduce
the number of degrees of freedom while keeping a similar accuracy. On the other
hand, multigrid solvers may accelerate time marching computations for a fixed
number of degrees of freedom. In this paper, we combine both methods and
present a novel anisotropic p-adaptation multigrid algorithm for steady-state
problems that uses the multigrid scheme both as a solver and as an anisotropic
error estimator. To achieve this, we show that a recently developed anisotropic
truncation error estimator [\textit{Rueda-Ram\'irez et al., Truncation Error
Estimation in the p-Anisotropic DGSEM, J. of Scientific Computing}] is
perfectly suited to be performed inside the multigrid cycle with negligible
extra cost. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-stage p-adaptation procedure
which reduces the computational time when very accurate results are required.
The proposed methods are tested for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations,
where we investigate two cases: the 2D flow on a flat plate is studied to
assess accuracy and computational cost of the algorithm, where a speed-up of
816 is achieved compared to the traditional explicit method; and the 3D flow
around a sphere is simulated and used to test the anisotropic properties of the
proposed method, where a speed-up of 152 is achieved compared to the explicit
method. The proposed multi-stage procedure achieved a speed-up of 2.6 in

ability to model fast turn-switches and overlap. A more flexible approach is to
model turn-taking in a continuous manner using RNNs, where the system predicts
speech probability scores for discrete frames within a future window. The
continuous predictions represent generalized turn-taking behaviors observed in
the training data and can be applied to make decisions that are not just

analytical expression for the phase shifts that enter into the definitions of
partial amplitudes that define the scattering cross sections and the induced

  Inequalities",,,,,"math.ST econ.EM stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers inference for a function of a parameter vector in a
partially identified model with many moment inequalities. This framework allows
the number of moment conditions to grow with the sample size, possibly at
exponential rates. Our main motivating application is subvector inference,
i.e., inference on a single component of the partially identified parameter
vector associated with a treatment effect or a policy variable of interest.
  Our inference method compares a MinMax test statistic (minimum over
parameters satisfying $H_0$ and maximum over moment inequalities) against
critical values that are based on bootstrap approximations or analytical
bounds. We show that this method controls asymptotic size uniformly over a
large class of data generating processes despite the partially identified many
moment inequality setting. The finite sample analysis allows us to obtain
explicit rates of convergence on the size control. Our results are based on
combining non-asymptotic approximations and new high-dimensional central limit
theorems for the MinMax of the components of random matrices. Unlike the
previous literature on functional inference in partially identified models, our
results do not rely on weak convergence results based on Donsker's class
assumptions and, in fact, our test statistic may not even converge in
distribution. Our bootstrap approximation requires the choice of a tuning
parameter sequence that can avoid the excessive concentration of our test
statistic. To this end, we propose an asymptotically valid data-driven method
to select this tuning parameter sequence. This method generalizes the selection
of tuning parameter sequences to problems outside the Donsker's class
assumptions and may also be of independent interest. Our procedures based on
self-normalized moderate deviation bounds are relatively more conservative but
easier to implement.

monolayers are rather well-preserved in the resultant heterostructure due to
the weak van der Waals interaction between the layers. However, the proximity
of MoS2 induces strong spin orbit coupling effect of strength ~1 meV in
graphene, which is nearly three orders of magnitude larger than the intrinsic
spin orbit coupling of pristine graphene. This opens a bandgap in graphene and
further causes anticrossings of the spin-nondegenerate bands near the Dirac

interesting moire' patterns which have been observed in experiments. The
electronic bandstructure of heterostructure is very sensitive to biaxial strain
and interlayer twist. Although the Dirac cone of graphene remains intact and no
charge-transfer between graphene and MoS2 layers occurs at ambient conditions,
a strain-induced charge-transfer can be realized in graphene/MoS2

Understanding the fluid behavior of the area adjacent to the trailing edge is

often purged at the trailing edge to cool the thin blade edges, affecting the

of scattering in two dimensions (2D) ensure that inversion-odd and
inversion-even distortions of the quasiparticle distribution relax with
parametrically different rates at low temperature. This entails the surprising
result that at lowest temperatures the conductance of very long samples tends
to the noninteracting, ballistic conductance, despite the relaxation of the
quasiparticle distribution to a drifting equilibrium. The relative correction
to the conductance depends on the ratio of relaxation rates of even and odd

with distinct spatial and spectral distributions dominate the emission at
different wavelengths. An extended $2^\circ \times 3^\circ$ nebula is seen in
radio and GeV gamma rays. An elongated cocoon prevails in X-rays and TeV gamma
rays. We use 9.5 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to
disentangle gamma-ray emission from the two components in the energy range from
10 GeV to 2 TeV, bridging the gap between previous measurements at GeV and TeV
energies. We determine the morphology of emission associated to Vela X
separately at energies < 100 GeV and > 100 GeV, and compare it to the
morphology seen at other wavelengths. Then, we derive the spectral energy
distribution of the two gamma-ray components over the full energy range. The
best fit to the LAT data is provided by the combination of the two components
derived at energies < 100 GeV and > 100 GeV. The first component has a soft
spectrum, spectral index $2.19\pm0.16^{+0.05}_{-0.22}$, and extends over a
region of radius $1.36^\circ\pm0.04^\circ$, consistent with the radio nebula.
The second component has a harder spectrum, spectral index
$0.9\pm0.3^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$, and is concentrated over an area of radius
$0.63^\circ\pm0.03^\circ$, coincident with the X-ray cocoon that had already
been established to account for the bulk of the emission at TeV energies. The
spectrum measured for the low-energy component corroborates previous evidence
for a roll-over of the electron spectrum at energies of a few tens of GeV
possibly due to diffusive escape. The high-energy component has a very hard
spectrum: if the emission is produced by electrons with a power-law spectrum
the electrons must be uncooled, and there is a hint that their spectrum may be
harder than predictions by standard models of Fermi acceleration at
relativistic shocks. (Abridged)

proportional to the Helmholtz free energy density of a fermionic thermal bath,
hence showing a clear sign of Fermi-Dirac statistics, with no counterpart in
the response of a detector coupled linearly to a scalar field or its
derivative. By contrast, an observer examining just the stress-energy tensor
sees no difference between a fermion and a boson, neither at late times nor

trajectories on the Riemannian manifold of positive semidefinite matrices of

desirable quantity when comparing shapes, the spatial covariance, in addition
to the conventional affine-shape representation. We derived then geometric and
computational tools for rate-invariant analysis and adaptive re-sampling of
trajectories, grounding on the Riemannian geometry of the underlying manifold.
Specifically, our approach involves three steps: (1) landmarks are first mapped
into the Riemannian manifold of positive semidefinite matrices of fixed-rank to
build time-parameterized trajectories; (2) a temporal warping is performed on
the trajectories, providing a geometry-aware (dis-)similarity measure between
them; (3) finally, a pairwise proximity function SVM is used to classify them,
incorporating the (dis-)similarity measure into the kernel function. We show
that such representation and metric achieve competitive results in applications
as action recognition and emotion recognition from 3D skeletal data, and facial
expression recognition from videos. Experiments have been conducted on several

minimizes the long-term time-average transmit power expenditure while reducing

the imaging speed to the quantum limit could reveal extraordinary scenes about
the questionable quantization of life and intelligence, or the wave-particle

intrinsically limited by framing speed. Here, we introduce a new technique
based on a multiple non-collinear optical parametric amplifier principle

per second with higher spatial resolution than 30 line pairs per millimeter.
The MOPA imaging is applied to record the femtosecond early evolution of
laser-induced plasma grating in air for the first time. Our approach avoids the
intrinsic limitations of previous methods, thus can be potentially optimized
for higher speed and resolution, opening the way of approaching quantum limits

  Aiming for an efficient implementation of dynamic changes to probability

arrows of a free PROP with a commutative comonoid structure, also known as term

images. An efficient means is to train a deep network to map an image patch to
a vector space, in which the Euclidean distance reflects patch similarity.
Previous attempts learned such an embedding in a supervised manner, requiring
the availability of many annotated images. In this paper, we present an
unsupervised embedding of natural image patches, avoiding the need for
annotated images. The key idea is that the similarity of two patches can be
learned from the prevalence of their spatial proximity in natural images.
Clearly, relying on this simple principle, many spatially nearby pairs are
outliers, however, as we show, the outliers do not harm the convergence of the
metric learning. We show that our unsupervised embedding approach is more
effective than a supervised one or one that uses deep patch representations.
Moreover, we show that it naturally leads itself to an efficient

networks) are too slow for real-time application despite the excellent tracking
precision compared with the traditional ones. In this paper, a fast dynamic
visual tracking algorithm combining CNN based MDNet(Multi-Domain Network) and
RoIAlign was developed. The major problem of MDNet also lies in the time
efficiency. Considering the computational complexity of MDNet is mainly caused
by the large amount of convolution operations and fine-tuning of the network
during tracking, a RoIPool layer which could conduct the convolution over the
whole image instead of each RoI is added to accelerate the convolution and a
new strategy of fine-tuning the fully-connected layers is used to accelerate
the update. With RoIPool employed, the computation speed has been increased but
the tracking precision has dropped simultaneously. RoIPool could lose some
positioning precision because it can not handle locations represented by
floating numbers. So RoIAlign, instead of RoIPool, which can process floating
numbers of locations by bilinear interpolation has been added to the network.
The results show the target localization precision has been improved and it
hardly increases the computational cost. These strategies can accelerate the
processing and make it 7x faster than MDNet with very low impact on precision
and it can run at around 7 fps. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on
two benchmarks: OTB100 and VOT2016, on which high precision and speed have been

  Networks","8 pages, 6 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.CV q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of this work is to demonstrate the use of the ballistocardiogram
(BCG) signal, derived using head-mounted wearable devices, as a viable
biometric for authentication. The BCG signal is the measure of an person's body
acceleration as a result of the heart's ejection of blood. It is a
characterization of the cardiac cycle and can be derived non-invasively from
the measurement of subtle movements of a person's extremities. In this paper,
we use several versions of the BCG signal, derived from accelerometer and
gyroscope sensors on a Smart Eyewear (SEW) device, for authentication. The
derived BCG signals are used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) as
an authentication model, which is personalized for each subject. We evaluate
our authentication models using data from 12 subjects and show that our
approach has an equal error rate (EER) of 3.5% immediately after training and
13\% after about 2 months, in the worst case. We also explore the use of our
authentication approach for people with motor disabilities. Our analysis using
a separate dataset of 6 subjects with non-spastic cerebral palsy shows an EER
of 11.2% immediately after training and 21.6% after about 2 months, in the
worst-case.

  Generalizable Information Fusion",,,,,"eess.SP cs.CV physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: Heartbeat detection remains central to cardiac disease diagnosis
and management, and is traditionally performed based on electrocardiogram
(ECG). To improve robustness and accuracy of detection, especially, in certain
critical-care scenarios, the use of additional physiological signals such as
arterial blood pressure (BP) has recently been suggested. There, estimation of
heartbeat location requires information fusion from multiple signals. However,
reported efforts in this direction often obtain multimodal estimates somewhat
indirectly, by voting among separately obtained signal-specific intermediate
estimates. In contrast, we propose to directly fuse information from multiple
signals without requiring intermediate estimates, and thence estimate heartbeat
location in a robust manner. Method: We propose as a heartbeat detector, a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns fused features from multiple
physiological signals. This method eliminates the need for hand-picked
signal-specific features and ad hoc fusion schemes. Further, being data-driven,
the same algorithm learns suitable features from arbitrary set of signals.
Results: Using ECG and BP signals of PhysioNet 2014 Challenge database, we
obtained a score of 94%. Further, using two ECG channels of MIT-BIH arrhythmia
database, we scored 99.92\%. Both those scores compare favourably with
previously reported database-specific results. Also, our detector achieved high
accuracy in a variety of clinical conditions. Conclusion: The proposed
CNN-based information fusion (CIF) algorithm is generalizable, robust and
efficient in detecting heartbeat location from multiple signals. Significance:
In medical signal monitoring systems, our technique would accurately estimate
heartbeat locations even when only a subset of channels are reliable.

  systems more efficiently, Part III",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work belongs to a series of articles which have been dedicated to the
combination of signed particles and neural networks to speed up the
time-dependent simulation of quantum systems. More specifically, the suggested
networks are utilized to compute the function known as the Wigner kernel. In
the first paper, we suggested a network which is completely defined
analytically and which does not necessitate any training process. Although very
useful, this approach keeps the same complexity as the more standard finite
difference methods. In the second work, we presented a different architecture
which has generalization capabilities. Although more convenient in terms of
computational time, it still uses a similar structure compared to the previous
approach, with less neurons in the hidden layer but with the same expensive
activation functions (sine functions). In this work, we focus on neural
networks without any prior physics based knowledge. In more details, the
network now consists of different hidden layers which are based on more common,
and less computationally expensive, activation functions such as rectified
linear units, and which focus on predicting only one column of the discretized
Wigner kernel at a time. This new suggested architecture proves to accurately
learn the transform from the space of potential functions to the space of
Wigner kernels and performs very well during the simulation of quantum systems
(20 times faster). Finally, we simulate a one-dimensional quantum system
consisting of a wave packet impinging on a potential barrier for validation
purposes. This represents one further step ahead to achieve fast and reliable
simulations of time-dependent quantum systems.

instances of a model to which an adversary has black-box access through a
machine learning-as-a-service API. In providing an in-depth characterization of
membership privacy risks against machine learning models, this paper presents a
comprehensive study towards demystifying membership inference attacks from two
complimentary perspectives. First, we provide a generalized formulation of the
development of a black-box membership inference attack model. Second, we
characterize the importance of model choice on model vulnerability through a
systematic evaluation of a variety of machine learning models and model
combinations using multiple datasets. Through formal analysis and empirical
evidence from extensive experimentation, we characterize under what conditions
a model may be vulnerable to such black-box membership inference attacks. We
show that membership inference vulnerability is data-driven and corresponding
attack models are largely transferable. Though different model types display
different vulnerabilities to membership inference, so do different datasets.
Our empirical results additionally show that (1) using the type of target model
under attack within the attack model may not increase attack effectiveness and
(2) collaborative learning exposes vulnerabilities to membership inference
risks when the adversary is a participant. We also discuss countermeasure and
mitigation strategies.

periodically rib-stiffened double-panel with porous lining to reveal the effect
of combining the two characters above. The theoretical development of the
periodic composite structure, which is based on the space harmonic series and
Biot theory, is included. The system equations are subsequently solved
numerically by employing a precondition method with a truncation procedure.
This theoretical and numerical framework is validated with results from both
theoretical and finite element methods. The parameter study indicates that the
presence of ribs can lower the overall sound insulation, although a direct
transfer path is absent. Despite the unexpected model results, the method
proposed here, which combines poroelastic modeling and periodic structures
semi-analytically, can be promising in broadband sound modulation.

nonlinear in nature. It is shown in this paper that a mathematical form of

electric polarization of a dielectric medium to the electric field.
Nonlinearity of a PN-junction can be expressed in a series of successively
increasing orders of the nonlinearity. For a PN-junction diode, higher order
nonlinear terms become significant as a voltage across the diode is increased.
In this paper, a gradual emergence of a nonlinear regime with the amplitude of
a sinusoidal voltage is presented. Higher order harmonics are produced by
utilizing the nonlinearity of a single PN-junction diode. An experimental
realization of a frequency comb with the highest frequency up to the twentieth
harmonics is also presented. In addition, in the same circuit by making the
nonlinearity significant up to the second order, an experiment on generation of
the sum and difference of frequencies is realized.
