simulations, but new approaches are needed to fully understand their intricate
atomic structures. Here, we show how machine-learning (ML)-based techniques can
give new, quantitative chemical insight into the atomic-scale structure of
amorphous silicon (a-Si). Based on a similarity function (""kernel""), we define
a structural metric that unifies the description of nearest- and
next-nearest-neighbor environments in the amorphous state. We apply this to an
ensemble of a-Si networks, generated in melt-quench simulations with an
ML-based interatomic potential, in which we tailor the degree of ordering by
varying the quench rates down to $10^{10}$ K/s (leading to a structural model
that is lower in energy than the established WWW network). We then show how
""machine-learned"" atomic energies permit a chemical interpretation, associating
coordination defects in a-Si with distinct energetic stability regions. The
approach is straightforward and inexpensive to apply to arbitrary structural
models, and it is therefore expected to have more general significance for
developing a quantitative understanding of the amorphous state.

  Outcomes using Bayesian Dynamic Linear Models",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  One of the most significant barriers to medication treatment is patients'
non-adherence to a prescribed medication regimen. The extent of the impact of
poor adherence on resulting health measures is often unknown, and typical
analyses ignore the time-varying nature of adherence. This paper develops a
modeling framework for longitudinally recorded health measures modeled as a
function of time-varying medication adherence or other time-varying covariates.
Our framework, which relies on normal Bayesian dynamic linear models (DLMs),
accounts for time-varying covariates such as adherence and non-dynamic
covariates such as baseline health characteristics. Given the inefficiencies
using standard inferential procedures for DLMs associated with infrequent and
irregularly recorded response data, we develop an approach that relies on
factoring the posterior density into a product of two terms; a marginal
posterior density for the non-dynamic parameters, and a multivariate normal
posterior density of the dynamic parameters conditional on the non-dynamic
ones. This factorization leads to a two-stage process for inference in which
the non-dynamic parameters can be inferred separately from the time-varying
parameters. We demonstrate the application of this model to the time-varying
effect of anti-hypertensive medication on blood pressure levels from a cohort
of patients diagnosed with hypertension. Our model results are compared to ones
in which adherence is incorporated through non-dynamic summaries.

fraction of Si IV at cooler temperatures than those predicted by ionisation
equilibrium. All simulations with an injected energy flux $F>5\times10^{10}$
erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ resulted in optical depth effects on the Si IV emission,
with differences in both intensity and line shape compared to the optically
thin calculation. Weaker flares (down to $F\approx5\times10^{9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$) also resulted in Si IV emission forming under optically thick
conditions, depending on the other beam parameters. When opacity was
significant, the atmospheres generally had column masses in excess of
$5\times10^{-6}$ g cm$^{-2}$ over the temperature range $40$ to $100$ kK, and

graph-structured data have emerged. Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs)
have been used to address node and graph classification and matrix completion.
Although the performance has been impressive, the current implementations have
limited capability to incorporate uncertainty in the graph structure. Almost
all GCNNs process a graph as though it is a ground-truth depiction of the
relationship between nodes, but often the graphs employed in applications are
themselves derived from noisy data or modelling assumptions. Spurious edges may
be included; other edges may be missing between nodes that have very strong
relationships. In this paper we adopt a Bayesian approach, viewing the observed
graph as a realization from a parametric family of random graphs. We then
target inference of the joint posterior of the random graph parameters and the
node (or graph) labels. We present the Bayesian GCNN framework and develop an
iterative learning procedure for the case of assortative mixed-membership
stochastic block models. We present the results of experiments that demonstrate
that the Bayesian formulation can provide better performance when there are
very few labels available during the training process.

relatively simple framework inspired by effective field theory that satisfies
all Sakharov conditions. In particular, we study the effectiveness of
CP-violating source terms induced by dimension-six Yukawa interactions for
quarks and charged leptons. Despite the relatively small Yukawa coupling,
CP-violating source terms involving taus are quite effective and can account
for the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. We obtain analytical and
numerical expressions for the total baryon asymmetry, the former providing
important insight into what makes lepton CP violation relatively effective
compared to quark CP violation. Leptons also play an important role if the
CP-violating source involves top quarks. While the tau Yukawa coupling in the
Standard Model is small, it significantly enhances the baryon asymmetry by
transferring the chiral asymmetry in quarks, which is washed out by strong
sphalerons, to a chiral asymmetry in leptons. We conclude that leptons should
not be ignored even if CP violation is limited to the quark sector. The role of
leptons can be further increased in scenarios of new physics with additional
chiral-symmetry-breaking interactions between quarks and leptons, as can happen
in models with additional Higgs bosons or leptoquarks. Finally, we study
CP-violating dimension-six Yukawa interactions for lighter quarks and leptons
but conclude that these lead to too small baryon asymmetries.

nanopore are needed to enhance sensing performance for direct strand sequencing
and detection/mapping of sequence-specific features. We have created a method
for reducing and controlling the speed of DNA that uses two independently
controllable nanopores operated with an active control logic. The pores are
positioned sufficiently close to permit co-capture of a single DNA by both
pores. Once co-capture occurs, control logic turns on constant competing
voltages at the pores leading to a `tug-of-war' whereby the molecule is pulled
from both ends by opposing forces. These forces exert both conformational and
speed control over the co-captured molecule, removing folds and reducing the
translocation rate. When the voltages are tuned so that the electrophoretic
force applied to both ends of the molecule comes into balance, the life-time of
the tug-of-war state is limited purely by diffusive sliding of the DNA between
the pores. We are able to produce a tug-of-war state on 76.8% of molecules that
are captured with a maximum two-order of magnitude increase in average pore
translocation time relative to the average time for single-pore translocation.
Moreover, we quantify the translocation slow-down as a function of voltage
tuning and show that the slow-down is well described by a first passage
analysis for a one-dimensional sub-diffusive process. The ionic current of each
nanopore provides an independent sensor that synchronously measures a different
region of the same molecule, enabling sequential detection of physical labels,
such as mono-streptavidin tags. With advances in devices and control logic,
future dual-pore applications include genome mapping and enzyme-free
sequencing.

spirals-in inside the extended envelope of a massive giant star and enters the

jets. These jets explode the core and the envelope. In the specific polar CEJSN
scenario that we propose here the jets clear the polar regions of the giant
star before the NS enters the core. The jets that the NS launches after it
enters the core expand almost freely along the polar directions that contain a
small amount of mass. This, we suggest, explains the fast rise to maximum and
the fast ejecta observed at early times of the enigmatic transient AT2018cow.
The slower later time ejecta is the more massive equatorial outflow. We roughly
estimate the accretion phase onto the NS during the explosion phase to last for
a time of about 1000 seconds, during which the average mass accretion rate is
about 0.0001 Mo/sec. We outline the possible diversity of CEJSNe by listing
five other scenarios in addition to the polar CEJSN scenario.

the Einstein evolution equations of general relativity. The present work was
motivated by the effort to explain the coisotropic structure of the constraint
subset for the initial value problem by extending the notion of hamiltonian
structure from Lie algebra actions to general Lie algebroids over presymplectic
manifolds. After comparing possible compatibility conditions between the anchor
$A\to TM$ and the presymplectic structure on the base $M$, we choose the most
natural of them, given by a suitably chosen connection on $A$. We define a
notion of momentum section of $A^*$ and a condition for compatibility with the
Lie bracket. A Lie algebroid over a presymplectic manifold with compatible
anchor and momentum section is then called hamiltonian. For an action Lie
algebroid, we retrieve the conditions of a hamiltonian action. The clean zero
locus of the momentum section of a hamiltonian Lie algebroid is a coisotropic
submanifold. We show that a bracket-compatible momentum map is equivalent to a
closed basic extension of the presymplectic form, within the generalization of
the BRST model of equivariant cohomology to Lie algebroids. We construct
groupoids by reduction of an action Lie groupoid $G\times M$ by a subgroup $H$
of $G$ which is not necessarily normal, and we find conditions which imply that
a hamiltonian structure descends to their Lie algebroids. We consider many
examples and, in particular, find that the tangent Lie algebroid over a
symplectic manifold is hamiltonian with respect to some connection if and only
if the symplectic structure has a nowhere vanishing primitive. Recent results
of Stratmann and Tang show that this is the case whenever the symplectic
structure is exact.

positive weight condition, the partition function is manifestly positive. The
sign problem is eliminated; such models are easily simulated by a simple local
algorithm in any number of dimensions. Simulations of models in this subclass
show a rich set of behaviors. Propagators may exhibit damped oscillations,
indicating a clear violation of spectral positivity. Pattern formation may also
occur, with both stripe and bubble morphologies possible. The existence of a
positive representation is constrained by Lee-Yang zeros: a positive

matter. In electronic matter it has long been assumed that Landau order
parameters involve an even number of electron fields, with integer spin and
even charge, that are bosons. On the other hand, in low-dimensional magnetism,
operators are known to fractionalize so that the excitations carry spin-1/2.
Motivated by experiment, mean-field theory and computational results, we extend
the concept of ODLRO into the time domain, proposing that in a broken symmetry
state, quantum operators can fractionalize into half-integer order parameters.
Using numerical renormalization group studies we show how such fractionalized

process that produces high energy emission could also be responsible for the
radio emission. Namely, coalescence of magnetic islands in the sheet produces
magnetic perturbations that propagate away in the form of electro-magnetic
nano-shots. I estimate the parameters of this emission and show that they are
compatible with observations.

  observations","18 pages, 5 figures",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The equation of state for a degenerate gas of fermions at zero temperature in
the non relativistic case is a polytrope, i.e. $p=\gamma \rho^{5/3}/m_F^{8/3}$.
If dark matter is modelled by such non interacting fermion, this dependence in
the mass of the fermion $m_F$ explains why if dark matter is very heavy the
effective pressure of dark matter is negligible. Nevertheless, if the mass of
the dark matter is very small, the effective pressure can be very large, and
thus, a system of self-gravitating fermions can be formed. In this work we
model the dark matter halo of the Milky-Way by solving the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, with the equation of state for a
partially degenerate ultralight non interacting fermion. It is found that in
order to fit its rotational velocity curve of the Milky Way, the mass of the
fermion should be in the range $29 ~\mbox{eV} < m_F < 33~$eV. Moreover, the
central density is constrained to be in the range of $46 < \rho_0<61$
GeV/cm$^3$. The fermionic dark matter halo has a very different profile as
compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White profile, thus, the possible
indirect signals for annihilating dark matter may change by orders of
magnitude. We found bounds for the annihilation cross section in this case by
using the Saggitarius A* spectral energy distribution. Those limits are very
strong confirming the idea that the lighter the dark matter particle is, the
darkest it becomes.

The driven-dissipative dynamics is closely related to the natural linewidth of

reservior. Instead of modifying the effectively radiative decay, we propose an
alternatively optimized scheme, which combines the resonant Rydberg
antiblockade excitation and the Lyapunov control of the ground states to speed
up the prepration of the singlet state for two interacting Rydberg atoms. The
acceleration process strongly depends on the initial state of the system with
respect to the initial coherence between the singlet state and
decoherence-sensitive bright state. We study the optimal parameter regime for
fast entanglement preparation and the robustness of the fidelity against random

around 0.4 ms with the current experimental parameters. The scheme may be

the other aspects of a camera's image processing pipeline (gain, color

model the relevant components of an image processing pipeline when evaluating
our loss function, which allows training to be aware of all relevant

conclusions. NGC 3201 has 13 extra-tidal RR Lyrae stars which are
asymmetrically distributed around its center with more number of stars in its
trailing zone than its leading part. We conclude that these asymmetrical tidal

companion will cause the black hole to accrete at a transient super-Eddington
rate. The collision among the clumpy ejecta in the resulted jet could trigger
plasma instability. As a result, the plasma in the jet will emit coherent
curvature radiation. When the jet cone aims toward the observer, the apparent
luminosity can be $10^{41}-10^{42}$\,erg/s. The duration of the resulted flare
is $\sim$ millisecond. The high event rate of the observed non-repeating FRBs
can be explained. A similar scenario in the vicinity of a supermassive black
hole can be used to explain the interval distribution of the repeating source
FRB121102 qualitatively.

basic question about privately testing simple hypotheses: given two
distributions $P$ and $Q$, and a privacy level $\varepsilon$, how many i.i.d.
samples are needed to distinguish $P$ from $Q$ subject to
$\varepsilon$-differential privacy, and what sort of tests have optimal sample
complexity? Specifically, we characterize this sample complexity up to constant
factors in terms of the structure of $P$ and $Q$ and the privacy level
$\varepsilon$, and show that this sample complexity is achieved by a certain
randomized and clamped variant of the log-likelihood ratio test. Our result is
an analogue of the classical Neyman-Pearson lemma in the setting of private
hypothesis testing. We also give an application of our result to the private
change-point detection. Our characterization applies more generally to
hypothesis tests satisfying essentially any notion of algorithmic stability,
which is known to imply strong generalization bounds in adaptive data analysis,
and thus our results have applications even when privacy is not a primary

the context of single-field inflation. In particular, the steepest possible
growth has a spectral index of $n_s - 1 = 4$ once transients have died down.
Its primary implication is that any constraint on the power spectrum at a
particular scale can be extrapolated to an upper bound over an extended range
of scales. This is important for models which generate relics due to an
enhanced amplitude of the primordial scalar perturbations, such as primordial
black holes. In order to generate them, the power spectrum needs to grow many
orders of magnitude larger than its observed value on CMB scales - typically
achieved through a phase of ultra slow-roll inflation - and is thus subject to
additional constraints at small scales. We plot all relevant constraints
including CMB spectral distortions and gravitational waves sourced by scalar
perturbations at second order. We show how this limits the allowed mass of
PBHs, especially for the large masses of interest following recent detections
by LIGO and prospects for constraining them further with future observations.
We show that any transition from approximately constant $\epsilon$ slow-roll
inflation to a phase where the power spectrum rapidly rises necessarily implies
an intervening dip in power. We also show how to reconstruct a potential that
can reproduce an arbitrary time-varying $\epsilon$, offering a complementary
perspective on how ultra slow-roll can be achieved.

that they assume that each class is separable and ignore the relationship
between classes even though class overlapping frequently occurs in a real-world
scenario when data are collected on the basis of diverse or ambiguous criteria.
To overcome this limitation, we address a novel problem called class-distinct
and class-mutual image generation, in which the goal is to construct a
generator that can capture between-class relationships and generate an image
selectively conditioned on the class specificity. To solve this problem without
additional supervision, we propose classifier's posterior GAN (CP-GAN), in
which we redesign the generator input and the objective function of AC-GAN for
class-overlapping data. Precisely, we incorporate the classifier's posterior

posterior of generated data corresponds with that of real data. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of CP-GAN using both controlled and real-world

  https://takuhirok.github.io/rGAN/",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a framework that learns a
generative distribution through adversarial training. Recently, their
class-conditional extensions (e.g., conditional GAN (cGAN) and auxiliary
classifier GAN (AC-GAN)) have attracted much attention owing to their ability
to learn the disentangled representations and to improve the training
stability. However, their training requires the availability of large-scale
accurate class-labeled data, which are often laborious or impractical to
collect in a real-world scenario. To remedy this, we propose a novel family of
GANs called label-noise robust GANs (rGANs), which, by incorporating a noise
transition model, can learn a clean label conditional generative distribution
even when training labels are noisy. In particular, we propose two variants:
rAC-GAN, which is a bridging model between AC-GAN and the label-noise robust
classification model, and rcGAN, which is an extension of cGAN and solves this
problem with no reliance on any classifier. In addition to providing the
theoretical background, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our models through
extensive experiments using diverse GAN configurations, various noise settings,
and multiple evaluation metrics (in which we tested 402 conditions in total).

from the tracking. To increase synergy, we propose to more tightly integrate
the tasks by conditioning the object detection in the current frame on
tracklets computed in prior frames. With this approach, the object detection
results not only have high detection responses, but also improved coherence

interest, causing features to be influenced by irrelevant image content. To
address this problem, we present a reformulation of Deformable ConvNets that
improves its ability to focus on pertinent image regions, through increased

more comprehensive integration of deformable convolution within the network,

network training via a proposed feature mimicking scheme that helps the network

the effects of a parameter $\phi_*$ that controls inflationary dynamics and the
shape of the inflaton potential. For $\phi_* < M_p$, the departure of the
inflaton potential from the usual power-law behavior $\phi^n$ significantly
modifies the microscopic behavior of the preheating dynamics. We analyze and
compare the efficiency of production, thermalization and the final equation of
state of the system for different models under consideration with $n=2,4,6$ for
two different values of $\phi_*$. Most importantly as we increase $n$, or
decrease $\phi_*$, the preheating occurs very efficiently with the final
equation of state to be that of the radiation, $w=1/3$. Specially for $n=2$,
the final equation of state turned out to be $w\simeq 0.2$. However, a complete
decay of inflaton could not be achieved with the four-legs interaction for any
model under consideration. Therefore, in order to complete the reheating
process, we perform the perturbative analysis for the second stage of the
reheating phase. Taking the end product of the preheating phase as an initial
condition we have solved the homogeneous Boltzmann equations for both the
fields supplemented by the constraints coming from the subsequent entropy
conservation. In so doing, we can calculate the reheating temperature which is
otherwise ill-defined right after the end of preheating. The temperature can be
uniquely fixed for a given inflaton decay constant and the CMB temperature. We
also compare our results with the conventional reheating constraint analysis

Specifically we show that aspects of band topology protected by crystalline
symmetries determine key properties of the Dirac spin liquid (DSL) which can be
defined on the honeycomb, square, triangular and kagom\'e lattices. At low
energies, the DSL on all these lattices is described by an emergent Quantum
Electrodynamics (QED$_3$) with $N_f=4$ flavors of Dirac fermions coupled to a
$U(1)$ gauge field. However the symmetry properties of the magnetic monopoles,
an important class of critical degrees of freedom, behave very differently on
different lattices. In particular, we show that the lattice momentum and
angular momentum of monopoles can be determined from the charge (or Wannier)
centers of the corresponding spinon insulator. We also show that for DSLs on
bipartite lattices, there always exists a monopole that transforms trivially
under all microscopic symmetries owing to the existence of a parent SU(2) gauge
theory. We connect our results to generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems and

tasks, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry and drug discovery to
machine learning. In many settings --- most prominently in so-called
parametrized or variational algorithms --- the objective function is a result
of hybrid quantum-classical processing. To optimize the objective, it is useful
to have access to exact gradients of quantum circuits with respect to gate
parameters. This paper shows how gradients of expectation values of quantum
measurements can be estimated using the same, or almost the same, architecture
that executes the original circuit. It generalizes previous results for
qubit-based platforms, and proposes recipes for the computation of gradients of
continuous-variable circuits. Interestingly, in many important instances it is
sufficient to run the original quantum circuit twice while shifting a single
gate parameter to obtain the corresponding component of the gradient. More
general cases can be solved by conditioning a single gate on an ancilla.

discovery in other wavebands. We used HST/WFC3 and CFHT optical and
near-infrared imaging together with IRAM and SMA interferometry of the CO(4-3)
line and 850 $\mu$m dust emission to characterize the foreground lensing mass
distribution, construct a lens model with Lenstool, and calculate gravitational
magnification factors between 20 and 50 in most of the source. The majority of
the star formation takes place within two massive star-forming clumps which are
marginally gravitationally bound and embedded in a $9 \times 10^{10}$ Msun,
fragmented disk with 20% gas fraction. One of the clumps shows a pronounced
blue wing in the CO(4-3) line profile, which we interpret as a wind signature.
The mass outflow rates are high enough for us to suspect that the clump might
become unbound within a few tens of Myr, unless the outflowing gas can be
replenished by gas accretion from the surrounding disk. The velocity offset of
-200 km s$^{-1}$ is above the escape velocity of the clump, but not that of the
galaxy overall, suggesting that much of this material might ultimately rain
back onto the galaxy and contribute to fueling subsequent star formation.

earlier, at $z \gtrsim 6$, thereby better matching the observations of
intergalactic Lyman-alpha opacity from quasar spectra and electron-scattering
optical depth from cosmic microwave background fluctuations. CoDa II predicts a
UV continuum luminosity function in good agreement with observations of high-z
galaxies, especially at $z = 6$. As in CoDa I, reionization feedback suppresses
star formation in haloes below $\sim 2 \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$, though
suppression here is less severe, a possible consequence of modifying the
star-formation algorithm. Suppression is environment-dependent, occurring
earlier (later) in overdense (underdense) regions, in response to their local
reionization times. Using a constrained realization of $\Lambda$CDM constructed
from galaxy survey data to reproduce the large-scale structure and major
objects of the present-day Local Universe, CoDa II serves to model both global

Observations of broad emission lines could potentially constrain the mechanism
for transporting gas inwards through accretion disks or outwards through winds.
The size of this broad-line region has been estimated by measuring the light
travel time delay between the variable nuclear continuum and the emission lines
- a method known as reverberation mapping. In some models the emission lines
arise from a continuous outflow, whereas in others they are produced by
orbiting gas clouds. Directly imaging such regions has not hitherto been
possible because of their small angular sizes (< 0.1 milli-arcseconds). Here we
report a spatial offset (with a spatial resolution of ten micro-arcseconds or
about 0.03 parsecs for a distance of 550 million parsecs) between the red and
blue photo-centres of the broad Paschen-{\alpha} line of the quasar 3C 273
perpendicular to the direction of its radio jet. This spatial offset
corresponds to a gradient in the velocity of the gas and thus implies that the
gas is orbiting the central supermassive black hole. The data are well fitted
by a broad-line-region model of a thick disk of gravitationally bound material
orbiting a black hole of 300 million solar masses. We infer a disk radius of
150 light days; a radius of 100-400 light days was found previously using
reverberation mapping. The rotation axis of the disk aligns in inclination and
position angle with the radio jet. Our results support the methods that are
often used to estimate the masses of accreting supermassive black holes and to
study their evolution over cosmic time.

Recent observations, however, have revealed chemical abundance changes with

azimuthal variations of the oxygen and iron abundances in disc galaxies. We
develop a new 2D galactic disc chemical evolution model, capable of following
not just radial but also azimuthal inhomogeneities. The density fluctuations
resulting from a Milky Way-like N-body disc formation simulation produce
azimuthal variations in the oxygen abundance gradients of the order of 0.1 dex.
Moreover, in agreement with the most recent observations in external galaxies,
the azimuthal variations are more evident in the outer galactic regions. Using
a simple analytical model, we show that the largest fluctuations with azimuth
result near the spiral structure corotation resonance, where the relative speed
between spiral and gaseous disc is the slowest. In conclusion we provided a new
2D chemical evolution model capable of following azimuthal density variations.
Density fluctuations extracted from a Milky Way-like dynamical model lead to a
scatter in the azimuthal variations of the oxygen abundance gradient in
agreement with observations in external galaxies. We interpret the presence of
azimuthal scatter at all radii by the presence of multiple spiral modes moving
at different pattern speeds, as found in both observations and numerical
simulations.

couplings, extrapolated via the minimal Standard Model Renormalization Group
evolution, hint at the exciting possibility of a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) at
$M_U \sim 10^{14}$ GeV --- a scale, however, too high to probe directly via
collider searches. Fortunately, since the Hubble scale H can be as high as $5
\times 10^{13}$ GeV $\sim M_U$ during the inflationary era, such GUT scale
states can be cosmologically produced at that time and leave direct on-shell
signatures such as their masses and spins, via primordial non-Gaussianity (NG).
We explore this possibility in one of its simplest realizations given by the
extra-dimensional framework of orbifold GUTs, in which proton decay can be
straightforwardly suppressed to be within the stringent bounds. Here, along
with the massive GUT states there must also be H-mass spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK)
gravitons, collectively giving rise to striking NG signatures. In our set-up we
localize the inflaton on one of the boundaries of an extra dimension. The
inflationary vacuum energy can readily lead to formation of a horizon in the
bulk, where the KK modes then form a continuum above a mass gap of $\sim
\mathcal{O}(H)$. We find that the optimal case for observable NG signals is
when the extra dimension is stabilized close to the onset of this horizon,
ensuring a discrete KK spectrum such that the lightest KK modes can be
cosmologically produced without significant Boltzmann suppressions. Although we
mostly focus on the case where there is no higher-dimensional cosmological
constant, we also obtain considerable holographic insights from the
$\text{AdS}_5/\text{CFT}_4$ correspondence when such a cosmological constant is
included.

extensively studied in two-dimensional magnetisms. However, the triangular

because of the spin-chirality cancellation in the umbrella ground state of the
undistorted TLAF. In this work, we study the band topology and the thermal Hall
effect (THE) of the TLAF with (anti-)trimerization distortion under the
external perpendicular magnetic field using the linearized spin wave theory. We
show that the spin-chirality cancellation is removed in such case, giving rise
to the non-trivial magnon band topology and the finite THE. Moreover, the
magnon bands exhibit band topology transitions tuned by the magnetic field. We
demonstrate that such transitions are accompanied by the logarithmic divergence
of the first derivative of the thermal Hall conductivity. Finally, we examine
the above consequences by calculating the THE in the hexagonal manganite
YMnO$_3$, well known to have anti-trimerization.

modern probabilistic models. However, practitioners are faced with a fragmented
literature that offers a bewildering array of algorithmic options. First, the
variational family. Second, the granularity of the updates e.g. whether the

Third, the method of optimization (bespoke or blackbox, closed-form or

Partitioned Variational Inference (PVI), that explicitly acknowledges these
algorithmic dimensions of VI, unifies disparate literature, and provides
guidance on usage. Crucially, the proposed PVI framework allows us to identify
new ways of performing VI that are ideally suited to challenging learning
scenarios including federated learning (where distributed computing is
leveraged to process non-centralized data) and continual learning (where new
data and tasks arrive over time and must be accommodated quickly). We showcase
these new capabilities by developing communication-efficient federated training
of Bayesian neural networks and continual learning for Gaussian process models
with private pseudo-points. The new methods significantly outperform the
state-of-the-art, whilst being almost as straightforward to implement as

straight and curved prolate capsules in unbounded simple shear flow at zero
Reynolds number using direct simulations. The curved capsules serve as a model
for the typical crescent-shaped sickle red blood cells in sickle cell disease
(SCD). The effects of deformability and curvature on the dynamics are revealed.
We show that with low deformability, straight prolate spheroidal capsules
tumble in the shear plane as their unique asymptotically stable orbit, which
contrasts with that for rigid spheroids where infinitely many neutrally stable
Jeffery orbits exist. The dynamics of curved prolate capsules are more
complicated due to a combined effect of deformability and curvature. At short
times, depending on the initial orientation, slightly deformable curved prolate
capsules exhibit either a Jeffery-like motion such as tumbling or kayaking, or
a non-Jeffery-like behavior in which the end-to-end vector of the capsule
crosses the shear-gradient plane back and forth. At long times, however, a
Jeffery-like quasi-periodic orbit is taken regardless of the initial
orientation. We further show that the average of the long-time trajectory can
be well approximated using the analytical solution for Jeffery orbits with an
effective orbit constant $C_{\textnormal{eff}}$ and aspect ratio
$\ell_{\textnormal{eff}}$. As the capsule becomes more deformable or curved,
$C_{\textnormal{eff}}$ decreases, indicating a shift of the orbit towards
log-rolling motion, while $\ell_{\textnormal{eff}}$ increases weakly as the
degree of curvature increases but shows negligible dependency on deformability.
As cell deformability, cell shape, and cell-cell interactions are all
pathologically altered in blood disorders such as SCD, these results will have
clear implications on improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of
hematologic disease.

iterative fashion. We demonstrate the efficacy of IT-Net as an anytime pose

grafted with well-defined low molecular weight ligands colloidally stable in
concentrated brine (in particular, API brine, 8% NaCl + 2% CaCl2) and are
interfacially active at the brine-air interface. These properties were achieved
for three types of ligands: a nonionic diol called GLYMO and two short
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) oligomers with 6-12 EO repeat units. Carbon
dioxide-in-water (C/W) foams could be formed only with modified NPs with higher

sufficiently CO2-philic that the hydrophilic/CO2-philic balance of silica NPs
was low enough for stabilization of CO2-in-water (C/W) foam with API brine.
Additionally, NPs with these three ligands formed stable dispersions with
various free molecular surfactants in DI water and even API brine (8% NaCl + 2%

mobile phone users. This is because applications leave distinct footprints in
the processor, which can be used by malware to infer user activities. In this
work, we show that these inference attacks are considerably more practical when
combined with advanced AI techniques. In particular, we focus on profiling the
activity in the last-level cache (LLC) of ARM processors. We employ a simple
Prime+Probe based monitoring technique to obtain cache traces, which we
classify with Deep Learning methods including Convolutional Neural Networks. We
demonstrate our approach on an off-the-shelf Android phone by launching a
successful attack from an unprivileged, zeropermission App in well under a
minute. The App thereby detects running applications with an accuracy of 98%
and reveals opened websites and streaming videos by monitoring the LLC for at
most 6 seconds. This is possible, since Deep Learning compensates measurement
disturbances stemming from the inherently noisy LLC monitoring and unfavorable
cache characteristics such as random line replacement policies. In summary, our
results show that thanks to advanced AI techniques, inference attacks are
becoming alarmingly easy to implement and execute in practice. This once more
calls for countermeasures that confine microarchitectural leakage and protect
mobile phone applications, especially those valuing the privacy of their users.

poorly understood. We obtained consistent visual-near-infrared (VNIR)
reflectance spectra of the sporadically active centaur 174P/Echeclus during a
period of inactivity in 2014 and six weeks after its outburst in 2016 to see if
activity had observably changed the surface properties of the nucleus. We
observed no change in the surface reflectance properties of Echeclus following
the outburst compared to before, indicating that, in this case, any surface
changes due to cometary activity were not sufficiently large to be observable
from Earth. Our spectra and post-outburst imaging have revealed, however, that
the remaining dust coma is not only blue compared to Echeclus, but also bluer

wavelength of around 1.3 micron before becoming neutral. We conclude that the
blue visual color of the dust is likely not a scattering effect, and instead
may be indicative of the dust's carbon-rich composition. Deposition of such

which its surface color could be neutralized.

resonance in the spectral density of states $2T_{K}^{\rho}$, obtained from a
Fano fit of the corresponding curves and also with the Kondo temperature,
$T_K^G$, defined from the temperature evolution of the equilibrium conductance

$2T_{\rm NE}$ strongly depends on the asymmetry between the couplings of the
quantum dot to the leads while the total hybridization is kept constant. While
the three scales are of the same order of magnitude, $2T_{\rm NE}$ and
$T_{K}^{\rho}$ agree only in the case of large asymmetry between the different
tunneling couplings of the contacts and the quantum dot. On the other hand, for
similar couplings, $T_{\rm NE}$ becomes larger than $T_{K}^{\rho}$, reaching
the maximum deviation, of the order of $30\%$, for identical couplings. The
fact that an additional parameter to $T_{\rm NE}$ is needed to characterize the
Kondo effect, weakenig the universality properties, points that some caution
should be taken in the usual identification in experiments of the low

our results indicate that the ratios $T_{\rm NE}/T_K^G$ and

inflation -- the average radius of these stars is $6\pm4$ per cent larger at a
given luminosity than predicted by commonly-used evolutionary models. This
over-radius is smaller (at 2-sigma confidence) than was found for similar stars
in the younger Pleiades using a similar analysis; any decline appears due to
changes occurring in higher mass ($>0.25 M_{\odot}$) stars. Models
incorporating magnetic inhibition of convection predict an over-radius, but do
not reproduce this mass dependence unless super-equipartition surface magnetic
fields are present at lower masses. Models incorporating flux-blocking by

accompanied by simultaneous emission of a Bremsstrahlung photon or a so-called

both the scintillation and the ionization signals in the analysis where the

(I) Under suitable monotonicity assumptions on the concatenated gradient map,

the sample-size increases at a geometric rate. If the sample-size increases at
a polynomial rate of degree $v > 0$, the mean-squared errordecays at a
corresponding polynomial rate while the iteration and oracle complexities to

$\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{1+1/v})$, respectively. (II) We then overlay (VS-PGR)
with a consensus phase with a view towards developing distributed protocols for
aggregative stochastic Nash games. In the resulting scheme, when the
sample-size and the consensus steps grow at a geometric and linear rate,
computing an $\epsilon$-NE requires similar iteration and oracle complexities

demonstrate the performance of the new solver, we focus on applying it to solve

challenges for existing solvers. To address the anisotropy, we additionally
developed a customized partitioning scheme for the solver, which captures the
strong-coupling direction accurately. In general, the partitioning can be
computed algebraically with existing software packages, and thus the new solver
is generalizable for solving other sparse linear systems. Our results show that

variable in $\gamma$-ray and optical/UV than X-ray and radio. Large variations
in the degree of polarization (DoP) and position angle (PA) is noticed during
the flaring period. Maximum flux during $\gamma$-ray flare is found to be
12.63$\times$10$^{-7}$ at MJD 58057.5 from the 1-day bin light curve (LC),
which is the maximum flux ever achieved by this source. It is further found
that all the peaks of flare are very symmetric, which suggests the cooling time
of electrons is much smaller than light crossing time. Using 1-day as a fast
variability time, the size of the $\gamma$-ray emission region is estimated as
1.88$\times$10$^{16}$ cm. Two 42 GeV of photons are detected during the flare
which puts a constraint on the location of the emission region, and it is found
that the $\gamma$-ray emitting blob is located at the outer edge or outside the
broad line region (BLR). A trend of increasing fractional variability towards
higher energies is also seen. Strong correlations were seen between
$\gamma$-ray, optical/UV, X-ray, and radio (15 GHz) emission. A small time lag
between $\gamma$-ray and optical/UV suggest their emission to be co-spatial
while lag of 27 days between $\gamma$-ray and OVRO (15 GHz) suggest two
different emission zone separated by a distance of $\sim$ 5 pc.

temperature for the onset of melting to 176 K and create a large temperature
range where partial melt is thermally stable. The evolution of regions of
ammonia-rich partial melt could strongly influence the geological and thermal
evolution of icy bodies. For melt to be extracted from partially molten
regions, the surrounding solid matrix must deform and compact. Whether
ammonia-rich melts sink to the subsurface ocean or become frozen into the ice
shell depends on the compaction rate and thermal evolution. Here we construct a
model for the compaction and thermal evolution of a partially molten,
ammonia-rich ice shell in a one-dimensional geometry. We model the thickening
of an initially thin ice shell above an ocean with $10\%$ ammonia. We find that
ammonia-rich melts can freeze into the upper $5$ to $10$ kilometers of the ice
shell, when ice shell thickening is rapid compared to the compaction rate. The
trapping of near-surface volatiles suggests that, upon reheating of the ice
shell, eutectic melting events are possible. However, as the ice shell
thickening rate decreases, ammonia-rich melt is efficiently excluded from the
ice shell and the bulk of the ice shell is pure water ice. We apply our results
to the thermal evolution of Neptune's moon Triton. As Triton's ice shell
thickens, the gradual increase of ammonia concentration in Triton's subsurface
ocean helps to prevent freezing and increases the predicted final ocean
thickness by up to $50$ km.

enable mobile users to place cellular calls over Wi-Fi networks based on the

cellular voice solutions, the major difference lies in that their traffic
traverses untrustful Wi-Fi networks and the Internet. This exposure to insecure

security mechanisms are similar to the VoLTE, because both of them are

autonomous cars have shown promise when operating in structured environments
under good driving conditions. However, for complex, cluttered and unseen
environments with high uncertainty, autonomous driving systems still frequently
demonstrate erroneous or unexpected behaviors, that could lead to catastrophic
outcomes. Autonomous vehicles should ideally adapt to driving conditions; while
this can be achieved through multiple routes, it would be beneficial as a first
step to be able to characterize Driveability in some quantified form. To this
end, this paper aims to create a framework for investigating different factors
that can impact driveability. Also, one of the main mechanisms to adapt
autonomous driving systems to any driving condition is to be able to learn and
generalize from representative scenarios. The machine learning algorithms that
currently do so learn predominantly in a supervised manner and consequently
need sufficient data for robust and efficient learning. Therefore, we also
perform a comparative overview of 45 public driving datasets that enable
learning and publish this dataset index at
https://sites.google.com/view/driveability-survey-datasets. Specifically, we
categorize the datasets according to use cases, and highlight the datasets that
capture complicated and hazardous driving conditions which can be better used
for training robust driving models. Furthermore, by discussions of what driving
scenarios are not covered by existing public datasets and what driveability
factors need more investigation and data acquisition, this paper aims to
encourage both targeted dataset collection and the proposal of novel
driveability metrics that enhance the robustness of autonomous cars in adverse
environments.

which yield more physical and less-oscillatory solutions. Total variation (TV)
has been widely used as an edge-preserving regularizer. However, objects are
often over-regularized by TV, becoming blob-like convex structures of low
curvature. This phenomenon was explained mathematically in the analysis of
Andreau et al. They have shown that a TV regularizer can spatially preserve
perfectly sets which are nonlinear eigenfunctions of the form $\lambda u \in
\partial J_{TV}(u)$, where $\partial J_{TV}(u)$ is the TV subdifferential. For
TV, these shapes are convex sets of low-curvature. A compelling approach to
better preserve structures is to use anisotropic functionals, which adapt the
regularization in an image-driven manner, with strong regularization along
edges and low across them. This follows earlier ideas of Weickert on
anisotropic diffusion, which do not stem directly from functional minimization.
Adaptive anisotropic TV (A$^2$TV) was successfully used in several studies in
the past decade. However, until now there is no theory formulating the type of
structures which can be perfectly preserved. In this study we address this
question. We rely on a recently developed theory of Burger et al on nonlinear
spectral analysis of one-homogeneous functionals. We have that eigenfunction
sets, admitting $\lambda u \in \partial J_{A^2TV}(u)$, are perfectly preserved
under A$^2$TV-flow or minimization with $L^2$ square fidelity. We thus
investigate these eigenfunctions theoretically and numerically. We prove
non-convex sets can be eigenfunctions in certain conditions and provide
numerical results which characterize well the relations between the degree of
local anisotropy of the functional and the admitted maximal curvature....

collection and algorithm design. However, recent reports of neglect,
unresponsiveness, and malevolence cast doubt on whether service providers can
effectively implement fairness solutions. These reports invite us to revisit
assumptions made about the service providers in fairness solutions. Namely,
that service providers have (i) the incentives or (ii) the means to mitigate
optimization externalities. Moreover, the environmental impact of these systems
suggests that we need (iii) novel frameworks that consider systems other than

sensitively on the environment seen by the magnetic impurity. A high degree of
responsiveness can be obtained with metal complexes, as the embedding of a
metal ion into an organic molecule prevents intercalation or alloying and
allows for a good control by an appropriate choice of the ligands. There are
therefore hopes to reach an ""on demand"" control of the spin state of single
molecules adsorbed on substrates. Hitherto one route was to rely on
""switchable"" molecules with intrinsic bistabilities triggered by external
stimuli, such as temperature or light, or on the controlled dosing of chemicals
to form reversible bonds. However, these methods constrain the functionality to
switchable molecules or depend on access to atoms or molecules. Here, we
present a way to induce bistability also in a planar molecule by making use of
the environment. We found that the particular ""habitat"" offered by an antiphase
boundary of the Rashba system BiAg$_2$ stabilizes a second structure for
manganese phthalocyanine molecules, in which the central Mn ion moves out of
the molecular plane. This corresponds to the formation of a large magnetic
moment and a concomitant change of the ground state with respect to the
conventional adsorption site. The reversible spin switch found here shows how
we can not only rearrange electronic levels or lift orbital degeneracies via
the substrate, but even sway the effects of many-body interactions in single

a dual role: it causes precession of the nanomagnet's magnetization about an

$1<p<\infty$ is estimated by $[w]_{A_p}^{s}$, where $[w]_{A_p}$ is the $A_p$
characteristic of the weight $w$ and $s = \max(1,1/(p-1))$; as simple examples
with power weights show, these estimates are sharp.
  A natural question to ask, is whether it is possible to improve the exponent
$s$ in the above estimate if one replaces the $A_p$ characteristic by its
""fattened"" version, where the averages are replaced by Poisson-like averages.
For power weights (for example with $p=2$ and Poisson averages) one can see
that there is indeed an improvement in the exponent: but is it true for general
weights?
  In this paper we show that the optimal exponent $s$ remains the same by
constructing counterexamples for arbitrarily ""smooth"" weights (in the sense
that the doubling constant is arbitrarily close to $2$), so the ""fattened""
$A_p$ characteristic is equivalent to the classical one, and such that
$\|T\|_{L^p(w)} \sim [w]_{A_p}^{s}$.
  We use the ideas from the unpublished manuscript by F. Nazarov disproving
Sarason's conjecture. We start from simple classical counterexamples for dyadic
models, and then by using what we call ""small step construction"" we transform
them into examples with weights that are arbitrarily dyadically smooth.
F.~Nazarov had used Bellman function method to prove the existence of such
examples, but our construction gives a way to get such examples from the
standard dyadic ones. We then use a modification of ""remodeling"", introduced by
J.~Bourgain and developed by F.~Nazarov, to get from examples for dyadic models
to examples for the Hilbert transform.
  As an added bonus, we present a proof that the $L^p$ analog of Sarason's

circumvent congested areas by revising their originally chosen routes.
Consequently, the network has ""healed itself"" as soon as all affected traffic

choice is modeled by means of discrete choice theory and regards the signaling
at the next observable intersection. To this end, we propose a microscopic
route choice model for event-oriented decisions. Subsequently, we examine four
distinct incident scenarios in a grid and real-size road network and compare
fixed-time and traffic-dependent traffic light controls with and without the

for significantly lower vehicle accumulations during and after the incident as

superquantile and quantile, are frequently used to characterize the tails of
probability distribution's and are popular measures of risk. Buffered
Probability of Exceedance (bPOE) is a recently introduced characterization of
the tail which is the inverse of CVaR, much like the CDF is the inverse of the
quantile. These quantities can prove very useful as the basis for a variety of
risk-averse parametric engineering approaches. Their use, however, is often
made difficult by the lack of well-known closed-form equations for calculating
these quantities for commonly used probability distribution's. In this paper,
we derive formulas for the superquantile and bPOE for a variety of common
univariate probability distribution's. Besides providing a useful collection
within a single reference, we use these formulas to incorporate the
superquantile and bPOE into parametric procedures. In particular, we consider
two: portfolio optimization and density estimation. First, when portfolio
returns are assumed to follow particular distribution families, we show that
finding the optimal portfolio via minimization of bPOE has advantages over
superquantile minimization. We show that, given a fixed threshold, a single
portfolio is the minimal bPOE portfolio for an entire class of distribution's
simultaneously. Second, we apply our formulas to parametric density estimation
and propose the method of superquantile's (MOS), a simple variation of the
method of moment's (MM) where moment's are replaced by superquantile's at
different confidence levels. With the freedom to select various combinations of
confidence levels, MOS allows the user to focus the fitting procedure on
different portions of the distribution, such as the tail when fitting
heavy-tailed asymmetric data.

factor loading matrix, $Q$, and the factors $f_{n}$. Here, it is assumed that
the noise co-variance is positive definite and allowed to be correlated with
the factors. An augmented matrix, \[
\tilde{M}\triangleq\left[\begin{array}{cccc} \tilde{\Sigma}_{yy}(1) &

determining the numerical rank of $\tilde{M}$. Using Rank Revealing QR (RRQR)
decomposition, a model order detection scheme is proposed for determining the
numerical rank and for estimating the loading matrix $Q$. The rate of
convergence of the estimates, as $K$ and $N$ tends to infinity, is derived and
compared with that of the existing Eigen Value Decomposition based approach.
Two applications of this algorithm, i) The problem of extracting signals from
their noisy mixtures and ii) modelling of the S&P index are presented.

$\{\gamma, Z, W^-\}$ among all three generations, and has mostly stood the test
of time. However, precision tests in $B$ decays have recently posed serious
challenges to lepton flavor universality, potentially pointing to New Physics

molecules with respect to whether they bind to specific protein targets. A key
breakthrough would occur if these models could reveal the fragment
pharmacophores that are causally involved in binding. Extracting chemical
details of binding from the networks could potentially lead to scientific
discoveries about the mechanisms of drug actions. But doing so requires shining
light into the black box that is the trained neural network model, a task that
has proved difficult across many domains. Here we show how the binding
mechanism learned by deep neural network models can be interrogated, using a
recently described attribution method. We first work with carefully constructed
synthetic datasets, in which the 'fragment logic' of binding is fully known. We
find that networks that achieve perfect accuracy on held out test datasets
still learn spurious correlations due to biases in the datasets, and we are
able to exploit this non-robustness to construct adversarial examples that fool
the model. The dataset bias makes these models unreliable for accurately
revealing information about the mechanisms of protein-ligand binding. In light
of our findings, we prescribe a test that checks for dataset bias given a
hypothesis. If the test fails, it indicates that either the model must be
simplified or regularized and/or that the training dataset requires
augmentation.

traditional print media (e.g., books and posters) to site-specific (e.g.,

explores the new possibilities of information and communication technologies.
Therefore, interactivity and participation have become key features in the
design process. Even in traditional print media, graphic designers are trying
to enhance user experience and exploring new interaction models. Moving posters
are an example of this. This type of posters combine the specific features of
motion and print worlds in order to produce attractive forms of communication
that explore and exploit the potential of digital screens. In our opinion, the
next step towards the integration of moving posters with the surroundings,
where they operate, is incorporating data from the environment, which also
enables the seamless participation of the audience. As such, the adoption of
computer vision techniques for moving poster design becomes a natural approach.
Following this line of thought, we present a system wherein computer vision
techniques are used to shape a moving poster. Although it is still a work in
progress, the system is already able to sense the surrounding physical
environment and translate the collected data into graphical information. The
data is gathered from the environment in two ways: (1) directly using motion
tracking; and (2) indirectly via contextual ambient data. In this sense, each
user interaction with the system results in a different experience and in a
unique poster design.

nominal sets combined with the ability to work with isomorphic representations
of finite maps, make it possible to give a formal treatment, in Coq, of a
higher-order module system, including the ability to eliminate at compile time
abstraction barriers introduced by the module system. The development is based
on earlier work on static interpretation of modules and provides the foundation
for a higher-order module language for Futhark, an optimising compiler

implementation of two-level type theory, a version of Martin-Lof type theory
with two equality types: the first acts as the usual equality of homotopy type
theory, while the second allows us to reason about strict equality. In this
system, we can formalise results of partially meta-theoretic nature. We develop
and explore in details how two-level type theory can be implemented in a proof

The deep regionlets framework consists of a region selection network and a deep
regionlet learning module. Specifically, given a detection bounding box
proposal, the region selection network provides guidance on where to select
sub-regions from which features can be learned from. An object proposal
typically contains 3-16 sub-regions. The regionlet learning module focuses on
local feature selection and transformations to alleviate the effects of

module to enable instance dependent soft feature selection and pooling. The
Deep Regionlets framework is trained end-to-end without additional efforts. We
present ablation studies and extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC dataset

performance over state-of-the-art algorithms, such as RetinaNet and Mask R-CNN,

in real-world applications. For a given HIN, many reasonable clustering results
with distinct semantic meaning can simultaneously exist. User-guided clustering
is hence of great practical value for HINs where users provide labels to a
small portion of nodes. To cater to a broad spectrum of user guidance evidenced
by different expected clustering results, carefully exploiting the signals
residing in the data is potentially useful. Meanwhile, as one type of complex
networks, HINs often encapsulate higher-order interactions that reflect the
interlocked nature among nodes and edges. Network motifs, sometimes referred to
as meta-graphs, have been used as tools to capture such higher-order
interactions and reveal the many different semantics. We therefore approach the
problem of user-guided clustering in HINs with network motifs. In this process,
we identify the utility and importance of directly modeling higher-order
interactions without collapsing them to pairwise interactions. To achieve this,
we comprehensively transcribe the higher-order interaction signals to a series
of tensors via motifs and propose the MoCHIN model based on joint non-negative
tensor factorization. This approach applies to arbitrarily many, arbitrary
forms of HIN motifs. An inference algorithm with speed-up methods is also
proposed to tackle the challenge that tensor size grows exponentially as the
number of nodes in a motif increases. We validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on two real-world datasets and three tasks, and MoCHIN
outperforms all baselines in three evaluation tasks under three different
metrics. Additional experiments demonstrated the utility of motifs and the
benefit of directly modeling higher-order information especially when user
guidance is limited.

neural network (CNN) and the hybrid Downsampled Skip-Connection Multi-Scale
(DSC/MS) models. These machine-learning models are applied to two-dimensional
cylinder wake as a preliminary test and show remarkable ability to reconstruct
laminar flow from low-resolution flow field data. We further assess the
performance of these models for two-dimensional homogeneous turbulence. The CNN
and DSC/MS models are found to reconstruct turbulent flows from extremely
coarse flow field images with remarkable accuracy. For the turbulent flow
problem, the machine-leaning based super-resolution analysis can greatly
enhance the spatial resolution with as little as 50 training snapshot data,
holding great potential to reveal subgrid-scale physics of complex turbulent
flows. With the growing availability of flow field data from high-fidelity
simulations and experiments, the present approach motivates the development of
effective super-resolution models for a variety of fluid flows.

Understanding spin textures of the surface states of topologically nontrivial

essential if they are to be utilized in future technologies. Here we use
first-principles calculations to show that pyrite-type crystals OsX2 (X= Se,

polarization that can be either in-plane or out-of-plane. We show that the
formation of low-energy states with symmetry-protected energy- and
direction-dependent spin textures on the (001) surface of these materials is a
consequence of a transformation from a topologically trivial to nontrivial
state, induced by spin orbit interactions. The unconventional spin textures of
these surface states feature an in-plane to out-of-plane spin polarization
transition in the momentum space protected by local symmetries. Moreover, the
surface spin direction and magnitude can be selectively filtered in specific
energy ranges. Our demonstration of a new class of topological material with

function is. The idea is illustrated with three increasingly smooth functions

to directly calculate the conditional maximal a posteriori probability (MAP)

  remnants","19 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/sty3092",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are so important in many astrophysical
fields, a debate on their progenitor model is still endless. Searching the
surviving companion in a supernova remnant (SNR) may distinguish different
progenitor models, since a companion still exists in the remnant for the
single-degenerate (SD) model, but does not for the double degenerate (DD)
model. However, some recent surveys do not discover the surviving companions in
the remnant of SN 1006 and Kepler's supernova, which seems to disfavor the SD
model. Such a result could be derived from an incorrect survey target. Here,
based on the common-envelope wind SD model for SNe Ia, in which the initial
binary system consists of a white dwarf (WD) and a main-sequence (MS) star, we
found that the companion at the moment of supernova explosion may be a MS,
red-giant (RG) or subdwarf B (sdB) star if a spin-down timescale of less than
$10^{\rm 7}$ yr is assumed. We show the properties of the companions at the
moment of supernova explosion, which are key clues to search the surviving
companions in SNRs. Here, we suggest that the sdB star may be the surviving
companion in some SNRs, even if the progenitor systems are the WD + MS systems.
The SNe Ia with the sdB companions may contribute to all SNe Ia as much as
22\%.

Radioheliograph (NoRH). The CRF consisted of a discrete circular ribbon with a
diameter of $\sim$1$\arcmin$ and a short inner ribbon observed in ultraviolet
(UV), extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), soft X-ray (SXR), and especially in 17 GHz.
The peak time ($\sim$04:58 UT) of the flare in 17 GHz coincided with that in UV
1600 {\AA} and SXR derivative as a hard X-ray proxy, implying the peak time of
impulsive energy deposition in the lower atmosphere. Shortly after the peak
time, converging motion and filling process in the flare loop were revealed in
AIA 131 {\AA} and two XRT filters (Be\_thin and Be\_med), which are clear
evidence for chromospheric evaporation upflows. The chromospheric evaporation
lasted for $\sim$6 minutes until $\sim$05:04 UT. The temperature, density, and
apparent velocities of the upflows are $\sim$10$^7$ K,
$\sim$1.8$\times$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, and 50$-$630 km s$^{-1}$ with a mean
value of $\sim$170 km s$^{-1}$. By comparison with previous models, we are able
to estimate that energies above 5$\times$10$^{10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ are
likely needed to explain the observational results. Since heating by thermal
conduction does not seem to provide enough energy, alternative mechanisms such
as nonthermal electrons or Alfv\'{e}nic waves might need to be invoked.

static and spherically symmetric metric for the even parity modes are presented
in the context of an effective four-dimensional theory on the brane. This
subsequently leads to the sought expression for the tidal Love number for black
holes in the presence of extra spatial dimensions. Surprisingly, these numbers
are non-zero and, more importantly, negative. We extend our method to determine
the tidal Love number of neutron stars in a spacetime inheriting extra
dimensions and show that, in the context of effective gravitational theory on
the brane, they are smaller than in general relativity. Finally we have
explicitly demonstrated that earlier constraints on the parameters inherited
from higher dimensions are consistent with the bound on the tidal deformability
parameter from the GW170817 event as well.

motivate the proposed method, we first investigate the theoretical properties
of a straightforward Divide-and-Conquer Stochastic Gradient Descent (DC-SGD)

stochastic subgradient. The key component in our method is the proposal of a
computationally efficient estimator of $\Sigma^{-1} w$, where $\Sigma$ is the
population Hessian matrix and $w$ is any given vector. Instead of estimating
$\Sigma$ (or $\Sigma^{-1}$) that usually requires the second-order
differentiability of the loss, the proposed First-Order Newton-type Estimator
(FONE) directly estimates the vector of interest $\Sigma^{-1} w$ as a whole and
is applicable to non-differentiable losses. Our estimator also facilitates the
inference for the empirical risk minimizer. It turns out that the key term in
the limiting covariance has the form of $\Sigma^{-1} w$, which can be estimated

to vary with environment, with more HI-deficient spirals residing in high
density environments. This can be attributed to environmental effects such as
ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions, which remove HI from the discs
of galaxies. However, some spirals in low-density environments have also been
observed to have relatively low HI mass fractions. The low densities of the
Intergalactic Medium and lack of nearby galaxies in such environments make ram
pressure stripping and tidal interactions unlikely candidates of gas removal.
What then could be making these spirals HI deficient? Obreschkow et al.
introduced a parameter-free model for the neutral atomic gas fraction
($f_{atm}$), in a symmetric equilibrium disc as a function of the global atomic
stability parameter ($q$), which depends on specific angular momentum. In order
to examine if this model accounts for HI-deficient galaxies in low-density
environments, we have used the $M_{HI} ~-$ M$_{R}$ scaling relation to select
six HI-deficient spiral galaxies and observed them with the ATCA. By measuring
their $f_{atm}$ and $q$ values we find that the galaxies owe their observed HI
deficiencies to low specific angular momenta. Additionally, we also find that
the central HI hole sizes of our sample galaxies are related to their $q$
values, following the prediction of Obreschkow et al. This result brings to
light the importance of angular momentum in understanding the physics of the
interstellar medium in the discs of galaxies and consequently their evolution.

with a specified layout. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
approach for layout-based image generation; we call it Layout2Im. Given the
coarse spatial layout (bounding boxes + object categories), our model can
generate a set of realistic images which have the correct objects in the
desired locations. The representation of each object is disentangled into a
specified/certain part (category) and an unspecified/uncertain part
(appearance). The category is encoded using a word embedding and the appearance
is distilled into a low-dimensional vector sampled from a normal distribution.
Individual object representations are composed together using convolutional
LSTM, to obtain an encoding of the complete layout, and then decoded to an
image. Several loss terms are introduced to encourage accurate and diverse
generation. The proposed Layout2Im model significantly outperforms the previous
state of the art, boosting the best reported inception score by 24.66% and
28.57% on the very challenging COCO-Stuff and Visual Genome datasets,

study the properties of this spin-glass model by the belief-propagation (BP)
equations under the replica-symmetry ansatz. We give the lower bound $\rho_c$
of the relative size of D with finite C on regular random graphs and
Erdos-Renyi random graphs. We find $\rho_c$ will decrease gradually with
growing C and it converges to $\rho_\infty$ as C$\to\infty$. The CD problem is
called dismantling problem when C is a small finite fraction of |V|. Therefore,
$\rho_\infty$ is also the lower bound of the dismantling problem when
|V|$\to\infty$. To reduce the computation complexity of the BP equations,
taking the knowledge of the probability of a random selected vertex belonging
to a remaining connected component with the size A, the original BP equations
can be simplified to one with only three states when C$\to\infty$. The
simplified BP equations are very similar to the BP equations of the feedback
vertex set spin-glass model [H.-J.~Zhou, Eur. Phys. J. B 86, 455 (2013)]. At

two other state-of-art heuristic algorithms are applied on various random

57999 to 58406 obtained with the newly built Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope
(TMRT). The glitch took place at the time around MJD 58232.4 when the pulsar
underwent an increase in the rotation frequency of $\Delta \nu$ about
1.38$\times 10^{-6}$ Hz, corresponding to a fractional step change of $\Delta
\nu / \nu$ $\thicksim$ 8.39$\times 10^{-7}$. Post$\textrm{-}$glitch $\nu$
gradually decreased to the pre$\textrm{-}$glitch value. The frequency
derivative was observed to undergo a step change of about $-$9$\times 10^{-16}$
s$^{-2}$. Since July 1987, there are 36 glitches already reported in PSR
B1737$-$30 including this one. According to our analysis, the glitch size
distribution is well described by the power law with index of 1.13. The
distribution of the interval between two adjacent glitches (waiting time
$\Delta T$) follows a Poissonian probability density function. For PSR
B1737$-$30, the interval is prone to be long after a large glitch. But no
correlation is found between glitch size and the interval since previous
glitch.

an empty cavity, we show that only states with even number of photons can be
measured under resonant condition since the squeezed vacuum consists of states
with even number of photons only. When a single atom is trapped in the cavity,
the strong coupling between the atom and cavity results in energy splittings of
the system, and there exist two peaks in the cavity excitation spectrum at
two-photon transition frequencies. At the central frequency, however, all
photon states can be detected because of the interaction between the atom and
cavity. Therefore, it can be used to detect whether a single atom is trapped in
the cavity. We also show that the squeezed vacuum can promote multiphoton

explore higher Jaynes-Cummings doublet even if the probe field intensity is

setting for winner-selecting dice is similar to auctions with feasibility
constraints: candidates have random types drawn from independent prior

winners are selected to maximize the sum of the dice rolls, subject to the
feasibility constraints. We examine the existence of winner-selecting dice that
implement prescribed probabilities of winning (i.e., an interim rule) for all

  Our first result shows that when the feasibility constraint is a matroid,
then for any feasible interim rule, there always exist winner-selecting dice
that implement it. Unfortunately, our proof does not yield an efficient
algorithm for constructing the dice. In the special case of a 1-uniform
matroid, i.e., only one winner can be selected, we give an efficient algorithm
that constructs winner-selecting dice for any feasible interim rule.
Furthermore, when the types of the candidates are drawn in an i.i.d.~manner and
the interim rule is symmetric across candidates, unsurprisingly, an algorithm
can efficiently construct symmetric dice that only depend on the type but not

requirement in many tasks. Collective Matrix Factorization (CMF) is a technique
to learn shared latent representations from arbitrary collections of matrices.
It can be used to simultaneously complete one or more matrices, for predicting
the unknown entries. Classical CMF methods assume linearity in the interaction
of latent factors which can be restrictive and fails to capture complex
non-linear interactions. In this paper, we develop the first deep-learning
based method, called dCMF, for unsupervised learning of multiple shared

collection of matrices. We address optimization challenges that arise due to
dependencies between shared representations through Multi-Task Bayesian
Optimization and design an acquisition function adapted for collective learning
of hyperparameters. Our experiments show that dCMF significantly outperforms
previous CMF algorithms in integrating heterogeneous data for predictive
modeling. Further, on two tasks - recommendation and prediction of gene-disease
association - dCMF outperforms state-of-the-art matrix completion algorithms

established as a possible source of sensing matrix decorrelation. Secondly, two
novel algorithms are proposed which exploit this partial de-correlation and
collect sensing matrix diversity. Enjoying a low-complexity, these methods do

paper, we introduce the KETI (short for Korea Electronics Technology Institute)

interaction in a type-I Dirac semimetal (DSM) with $x$-direction tilt by
performing a renormalization group analysis. The interplay between disorder and
ordinary tilt generates an effective tilt along the $x$-direction, which is the
physically observable one. There exist two types of disorder which increase the
effective tilt and drive a phase transition from the DSM phase to the diffusive
metal phase. The diffusive phase transition stops the increase of the effective
tilt and the surface of the original Dirac cone in the diffusive metal phase is
just slightly tilted. Surprisingly, the Dirac point is replaced by a bulk nodal
arc in the diffusive metal phase. The Coulomb interaction suppresses the
diffusive phase transition and therefore is harmful to the formation of bulk
nodal arc. In contrast, there also exists other two types of disorder which
reduce the effective tilt and induce no phase transition. For these two types
of disorder, the Coulomb interaction enhances their low-energy relevances.
Coexistence of Coulomb interaction with any of them leads to a stable infrared
fixed point where the coupling strengths for two kinds of interaction are
identical and the effective tilt vanishes. The original tilted Dirac semimetal
now reacts like an untilted and interaction-free Dirac semimetal. Our results
show that interplay between tilt, disorder, and Coulomb interaction results in
rich low-energy properties for the tilted Dirac fermions.

and low-loss Au enhances the polarizabilty of single dimers compared to that of
isolated Ni nanodisks. Far-field diffractive coupling in periodic lattices of
these two particle types enlarges the difference in effective polarizability
further. This effect is explained by an inverse relationship between the
damping of collective surface lattice resonances and the imaginary
polarizability of individual scatterers. Optical reflectance measurements,

simulations confirm the analytical results. Hybrid dimer arrays supporting

stop the blood flow in the compressed area, as well as to significantly change
optical signals.
  The blood flow oscillations measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF)
characterize the functional state of the microvascular system and can be used
for noninvasive diagnostics of its abnormality. This study was intended to
identify the patterns of the relationship between the oscillating components of
blood flow registered by the LDF method under different levels of pressure
applied to an optical fiber probe.
  For this purpose we have developed an original optical probe capable of
regulating the applied pressure. The developed protocol included six sequential
records of the blood perfusion at pressure within the 0 to 200 mmHg range with
unloading at the last stage.
  Using wavelet analyses, we traced the variation of energy of oscillations for
these records in five frequency bands associated with different vascular tone
regulation mechanisms. Six young volunteers of the same age (three males and
three females) were included in this preliminary study and the protocol was
repeated five times in each volunteer. Totally 30 LDF records were available
for the analyses. As expected, the LDF signal increases at weak pressure (30
mmHg) and decreases at increased pressure. The statistically stable
amplification of endothelial associated blood flow oscillations under the 90
mmHg pressure allowed us to put forward a hypothesis that the endothelial
activity increases. The possible causes of this phenomenon are discussed.

Theory, when dilaton potentials accompany the breaking of Supersymmetry, in the
USp(32) and U(32) orientifold models, and also in the heterotic SO(16)xSO(16)
model. The first two settings are a family of AdS3xS7 orientifold vacua and a
family of AdS7xS3 heterotic vacua, supported by form fluxes, with small
world-sheet and string-loop corrections within wide ranges of parameters. In
both cases we find some unstable scalar perturbations, as a result of mixings
induced by fluxes, confirming for the first class of vacua a previous result.
However, in the second class they only affect the l=1 modes, so that a Z2
projection induced by an overall internal parity suffices to eliminate them,
leading to perturbative stability. Moreover, the constant dilaton profiles of
these vacua allow one to extend the analysis to generic potentials, thus
exploring the possible effects of higher-order corrections, and we exhibit wide
nearby regions of perturbative stability. The solutions in the third setting
have nine-dimensional Poincare' symmetry. They include regions with large
world-sheet or string-loop corrections, but we show that these vacua have no
perturbative instabilities. Finally, the last setting concerns cosmological
solutions in ten dimensions where the ""climbing"" phenomenon takes place: they
have bounded string-loop corrections but large world-sheet ones close to the
initial singularity. We find that perturbations generally decay, but
homogeneous tensor modes exhibit an interesting logarithmic growth that signals
a breakdown of isotropy. If the Universe then proceeds to lower dimensions,
milder potentials from other branes force all perturbations to remain bounded.

important because of a potential role in micro-mixing and micro-machines.
Centrifugal actuation can play an important role in driving the flow and
Coriolis force can enhance the mixing in a short span by destabilizing the
flow. In this study, we focus on the impact of the Coriolis force on a rotating
viscosity-stratified flow with a thin diffusive mixed layer between two fluid
layers. Modal stability analysis is used to estimate the critical parameters,
namely Rotation number, Reynolds number, and wave number, which are responsible
to modulate the instability mechanism for different viscosity contrasts.
Present study explores competing influences of rotational forces against the
viscous and inertial forces. Correspondingly, rotational direction
(clockwise/anticlockwise) shows a significant effect on the spatio-temporal
instability mechanism and anticlockwise rotation promotes the instability.
Usually, miscible viscosity stratified flow with respect to streamwise
disturbance becomes more unstable for a thinner mixed layer. On the contrary,
our numerical computation confirms a completely contrasting scenario,
considering Coriolis force driven instability of a miscible system on account
of spanwise disturbances. Possible physical mechanisms for the same are
discussed in terms of base flow and energy fluctuation among perturbed and base
flow. Comparison of two and three-dimensional instability is done to give a
clear-cut idea about the linear instability of the flow system considered
herein. Velocity and viscosity perturbation distributions display a critical
bonding between the vortices near and away from mixed layer, which may be
responsible for the variation of instability with respect to viscosity ratio
and rotational direction.

transitions between the two different subbands, which are sensitive to the

optical absorption peak at the plasmon frequency for a given Fermi energy,
$E_F$. The plasmon frequencies calculated for many SWNTs with diameter $d_t <

different positions in a primary instance can benefit from different `experts'

labeling the best expert for each position entails unacceptable cognitive
burden. We propose GITNet, a unified position-sensitive multi-task recurrent

auxiliary instances. A primary instance is also submitted to each auxiliary
RNN, but their state sequences are gated and merged into a novel composite
state sequence tailored to the primary inference task. Our approach is in sharp
contrast to recent multi-task networks like the cross-stitch and sluice

demonstrate the superiority of GIRNet using three applications: sentiment
classification of code-switched passages, part-of-speech tagging of

manifolds whose symmetrized Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric) in d
dimensions with nonvanishing torsion that has both a trace and a traceless
part, and analyze invariance under extended conformal transformations of the
corresponding field equations. Then, we compare our results to the case of
Einstein manifolds with zero torsion and nonvanishing nonmetricity, where the
latter is given in terms of the Weyl vector (Einstein-Weyl spaces). We find
that the trace part of the torsion can alternatively be interpreted as the
trace part of the nonmetricity. The analysis is subsequently extended to
Einstein spaces with both torsion and nonmetricity, where we also discuss the
general setting in which the nonmetricity tensor has both a trace and a
traceless part. Moreover, we consider and investigate actions involving scalar
curvatures obtained from torsionful or nonmetric connections, analyzing their
relations with other gravitational theories that appeared previously in the
literature. In particular, we show that the Einstein-Cartan action and the
scale invariant gravity (also known as conformal gravity) action describe the

inferences and predictions. The efficiency of strategies for finding optimal
experimental set-ups is particularly important for experiments that are
time-consuming or expensive to perform. For instance, in the situation when the
experiments are modeled by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), multilevel
methods have been proven to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of
their single-level counterparts when estimating expected values. For a setting
where PDEs can model experiments, we propose two multilevel methods for
estimating a popular design criterion known as the expected information gain in
simulation-based Bayesian optimal experimental design. The expected information
gain criterion is of a nested expectation form, and only a handful of
multilevel methods have been proposed for problems of such form. We propose a
Multilevel Double Loop Monte Carlo (MLDLMC), which is a multilevel strategy
with Double Loop Monte Carlo (DLMC), and a Multilevel Double Loop Stochastic
Collocation (MLDLSC), which performs a high-dimensional integration by
deterministic quadrature on sparse grids. For both methods, the Laplace
approximation is used for importance sampling that significantly reduces the
computational work of estimating inner expectations. The optimal values of the
method parameters are determined by minimizing the average computational work,
subject to satisfying the desired error tolerance. The computational
efficiencies of the methods are demonstrated by estimating the expected
information gain for Bayesian inference of the fiber orientation in composite
laminate materials from an electrical impedance tomography experiment. MLDLSC
performs better than MLDLMC when the regularity of the quantity of interest,
with respect to the additive noise and the unknown parameters, can be
exploited.

the same origin, i.e., related to the past activity of Galactic center (GC).
Besides, those structures show significant bending feature toward the west in
Galactic coordinates. This inspires us to consider the possibility that the
bending may be caused by a presumed global horizontal galactic wind (HGW)
blowing from the east to the west. Under this assumption, we adopt a toy shock
expansion model to understand two observational features: (1) the relative
thickness of the NPS; (2) the bending of the {\it Fermi} bubbles and NPS. In
this model, the contact discontinuity (CD) marks the boundary of the {\it

$\sim$ 1.9-2.3, and the velocity of the HGW is ~ 0.7-0.9 $c_{s}$. Depending on
the temperature of the pre-shock ISM, the velocity of the expanding NPS in

argue that, the age of the NPS and the {\it Fermi} bubbles is about 18-34 Myr.

of spherical even-even nuclei and their propagation to the limits of nuclear
landscape have been investigated in covariant density functional theory (CDFT)
for the first time. In this study we consider only covariant energy density
functionals with non-linear density dependency. Statistical errors for binding
energies and neutron skins significantly increase on approaching two-neutron
drip line. On the contrary, such a trend does not exist for statistical errors
in charge radii and two-neutron separation energies. The absolute and relative
energies of the single-particle states in the vicinity of the Fermi level are
characterized by low statistical errors ($\sigma(e_i)\sim 0.1$ MeV).
Statistical errors in the predictions of spin-orbit splittings are rather
small. Statistical errors in physical observables are substantially smaller
than related systematic uncertainties. Thus, at the present level of the
development of theory, theoretical uncertainties at nuclear limits are
dominated by systematic ones. Statistical errors in the description of physical
observables related to the ground state and single-particle degrees of freedom
are typically substantially lower in CDFT as compared with Skyrme density
functional theory. The correlations between the model parameters are studied in
detail. The parametric correlations are especially pronounced for the $g_2$ and
$g_3$ parameters which are responsible for the density dependence of the model.
The accounting of this fact potentially allows to reduce the number of free
parameters of non-linear meson coupling model from six to five.

the integrand, however in the applied context these assumptions cannot always
be justified. As a result, quadrature error can introduce bias into estimated
moments, for which there is no compensatory mechanism in the classical
sigma-point filters. This can lead in turn to estimates and predictions that
are poorly calibrated. In this article, we investigate the Bayes-Sard
quadrature method in the context of sigma-point filters, which enables
uncertainty due to quadrature error to be formalised within a probabilistic
model. Our first contribution is to derive the well-known classical quadratures
as special cases of the Bayes-Sard quadrature method. Then a general-purpose

filters, so that uncertainty due to quadrature error is explicitly quantified.
Numerical experiments on a challenging tracking example with misspecified
initial conditions show that the additional uncertainty quantification built
into our method leads to better-calibrated state estimates with improved RMSE.

makers because it yields information on which channels are effective in
transmitting information. These channel choices are the result of a recursive
process of social interactions and determine the observable trading networks.
They are characterized by feedback mechanisms due to peer interaction and
therefore need to be understood as complex adaptive systems (CAS). When
modelling CAS, conventional approaches like regression analyses face severe
drawbacks since endogeneity is omnipresent. As an alternative, process-based
analyses allow researchers to capture these endogenous processes and multiple
feedback loops. This paper applies an agent-based modelling approach (ABM) to
the empirical example of the Indonesian rubber trade. The feedback mechanisms
are modelled via an innovative approach of a social matrix, which allows
decisions made in a specific period to feed back into the decision processes in
subsequent periods, and allows agents to systematically assign different
weights to the decision parameters based on their individual characteristics.
In the validation against the observed network, uncertainty in the found
estimates, as well as under determination of the model, are dealt with via an
approach of evolutionary calibration: a genetic algorithm finds the combination
of parameters that maximizes the similarity between the simulated and the
observed network. Results indicate that the sellers' channel choice decisions
are mostly driven by physical distance and debt obligations, as well as
peer-interaction. Within the social matrix, the most influential individuals
are sellers that live close by to other traders, are active in social groups
and belong to the ethnic majority in their village.

equal than dictionary-based approach in reconstructing MR parameter maps: the
difference in performance increased with the number of estimated parameters,

detector of ALICE. The reconstruction must yield results comparable to current
offline reconstruction and meet the time constraints like in the current High
Level Trigger (HLT), processing 50 times as many collisions per second as
today. It is derived from the current online tracking in the HLT, which is
based on a Cellular automaton and the Kalman filter, and we integrate missing
features from offline tracking for improved resolution. The continuous TPC
readout and overlapping collisions pose new challenges: conversion to spatial
coordinates and the application of time- and location dependent calibration
must happen in between of track seeding and track fitting while the TPC
occupancy increases five-fold. The huge data volume requires a data reduction
factor of 20, which imposes additional requirements: the momentum range must be
extended to identify low-pt looping tracks and a special refit in uncalibrated
coordinates improves the track model entropy encoding. Our TPC track finding
leverages the potential of hardware accelerators via the OpenCL and CUDA APIs

  Application to GRB 170817A","26 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aaf41d",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A large-scale ordered magnetic field plays a very important role in the
formation and acceleration of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet. During the GRB
prompt phase, some dissipation processes may happen and disturb the magnetic
field, making the field become random to some extent. Therefore, a mixed
magnetic field consisting of an ordered component and a random component is
plausible for the early afterglow phase. Here we investigate the polarization
evolution and light curve of an afterglow under such a 3-dimensional mixed
magnetic field. Three kinds of ordered component (i.e., aligned, toroidal and
radial) are discussed. We find that the three cases are distinguishable through
jet polarization evolution. The polarization angle for a 3D mixed magnetic
field with an aligned ordered component can evolve gradually but only changes
abruptly by $90^\circ$ in the toroidal and radial cases. Furthermore, during
the reverse shock crossing time, the polarization degree (PD) can be non-zero
for the toroidal case but roughly zero for the radial case. Since an aligned
component in a jet corresponds to a magnetar central engine and a toroidal
component corresponds to a black hole, GRB central engines are distinguishable
through polarization observations even if the magnetic field is mixed in a jet.
In addition, our polarization calculation can be applied to GRB 170817A
associated with GW170817. Using the recently-observed PD upper limit $12\%$ of
GRB 170817A at $t=244$ days, the magnetic field strength ratio of the ordered
to random components in this afterglow is constrained to be $\lesssim0.9$.

faster matching time and compressibility. First, we devise a novel
minutia-based local structure modeled by a mixture of 2D elliptical Gaussian
functions in the pixel space. Each local structure is mapped to the Euclidean
space by normalizing the local structure with the number of minutiae that
associates to it. This simple yet crucial crux enables fast dissimilarity
computation of two local structures with Euclidean distance without distortion.
A complementary texture-based local structure to the minutia-based local
structure is also introduced whereby both can be compressed via principal
component analysis and fused easily in the Euclidean space. The fused local
structure is then converted to a K-bit ordered string via a K-means clustering
algorithm. This chain of computation with sole use of Euclidean distance is
vital for speedy and discriminative bit-string conversion. The accuracy can be
further improved by a finger-specific bit-training algorithm in which two
criteria are leveraged to select useful bit positions for matching. Experiments
are performed on Fingerprint Verification Competition (FVC) databases for
comparison with existing techniques to show the superiority of the proposed
method.

beyond $170$~days, and confirms the jet origin for the observed outflow, in
contrast to more slowly declining expectations for `failed-jet' scenarios. We
show here that the broadband (radio, optical, X-ray) afterglow is consistent
with a structured outflow where an ultra-relativistic jet, with Lorentz factor
$\Gamma\gtrsim100$, forms a narrow core ($\sim5^\circ$) and is surrounded by a
wider angular component that extends to $\sim15^\circ$, which is itself
relativistic ($\Gamma\gtrsim5$). For a two-component model of this structure,
the late-time optical decline, where $F \propto t^{-\alpha}$, is
$\alpha=2.20\pm0.18$, and for a Gaussian structure the decline is
$\alpha=2.45\pm0.23$. We find the Gaussian model to be consistent with both the
early $\sim10$ days and late $\gtrsim290$ days data. The agreement of the
optical light curve with the evolution of the broadband spectral energy
distribution and its continued decline indicates that the optical flux is
arising primarily from the afterglow and not any underlying host system. This
provides the deepest limits on any host stellar cluster, with a luminosity

disks are not self-gravitating, they obey a polytropic equation of state, the
distribution of their specific angular momentum is constant, and they are
marginally stable, i.e. the disks completely fill their Roche lobe. Moreover,
contrary to existing approaches in the literature, our models are
thermodinamically relativist, as the specific enthalpy of the fluid can adopt
values significantly larger than unity. We study the dependence of the
morphology and properties of the accretion tori on the type of black hole
considered, from purely Kerr black holes with varying degrees of spin
parameter, namely from a Schwarzschild black hole to a nearly extremal Kerr
case, to Kerr black holes with scalar hair with different ADM mass and horizon
angular velocity. Comparisons between the disk properties for both types of
black holes are presented. The sequences of magnetized, equilibrium disks
models discussed in this study can be used as initial data for numerical
relativity codes to investigate their dynamical (non-linear) stability and used
in tandem with ray-tracing codes to obtain synthetic images of black holes
(i.e. shadows) in astrophysically relevant situations where the light source is
provided by an emitting accretion disk.

experiments were performed in a rectangular bubble column heated from one side

half of the injection section (close to the hot wall or close to the cold
wall). We characterise the global heat transport while varying two parameters:
the gas volume fraction $\alpha = 0.4\% - 5.1 \%$, and the Rayleigh number
$Ra_H=4\times10^9-2.2\times10^{10}$. As captured by imaging and characterised
using Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA), different flow regimes occur with
increasing gas flow rates. In the generated inhomogeneous bubbly flow there are
three main contributions to the mixing: (\textit{i}) transport by the buoyancy
driven recirculation, (\textit{ii}) bubble induced turbulence (BIT) and
(\textit{iii}) shear-induced turbulence (SIT). The strength of these
contributions and their interplay depends on the gas volume fraction which is
reflected in the measured heat transport enhancement. We compare our results
with the findings for heat transport in homogeneous bubbly flow from
Gvozdi{\'c} \emph{et al.} (2018). We find that for the lower gas volume
fractions ($\alpha<4\%$), inhomogeneous bubbly injection results in better heat
transport due to induced large-scale circulation. In contrast, for
$\alpha>4\%$, when the contribution of SIT becomes stronger, but so does the
competition between all three contributions, the homogeneous injection is more
efficient.

\rho + P_{r} + 2P_{l}$ being the trace of the energy momentum tensor. In the
first part, wormhole solutions are constructed imposing that the radial
pressure admits an equation of state corresponding to a varying Chaplygin gas.
Two forms for the varying Chaplygin gas are considered, namely $P_{r} = - B
b(r)^{u}/\rho^{\alpha}$ and $P_{r} = -B R(r)^{m}/ \rho^{\alpha }$,
respectively. In the second part, the wormhole models are constructed assuming
that the radial pressure can be described by a varying barotropic fluid. In
particular, $P_{r} = \omega b(r)^{v} \rho$ and $P_{r} =\hat{ \omega} r^{k}
R(r)^{\eta} \rho$ are considered, respectively, leading to two additional,
traversable wormhole models. In all cases, $b(r)$ is the shape function, and
$R(r)$ the Ricci scalar obtained from the wormhole metric for a redshift
function equal to $1$. With the help of specific examples, it is demonstrated
that the shape functions of the exact wormhole models previously constructed do
obey the necessary metric conditions. The same energy conditions help reveal
the physical properties of these models. A general feature is the violation of
the NEC~($\rho + P_{i} \geq 0$) in terms of the radial pressure $P_{r}$ at the
throat of the wormhole. For some of the models, one can satisfy the NEC at the
throat while a violation of the DEC~($\rho - P_{i} \geq 0$) occurs. To
summarize, exact wormhole models can be constructed with a possible violation
of the NEC and DEC at the throat of the wormhole, while being $\rho \geq 0 $.
Thus, the interesting feature appears that one has a violation of the
WEC~($\rho \geq 0$ and $\rho + P_{i} \geq 0$) not related to the energy density
behavior (the index i, being r resp. l, indicates radial resp. lateral
pressure).

three-dimensional time-reversible Navier-Stokes (RNS) system, wherein the
standard viscosity $\nu$ is replaced by a fluctuating thermostat that
dynamically compensates for fluctuations in the total energy. We analyze the
statistical features of the RNS steady states in terms of a non-negative
dimensionless control parameter $\mathcal{R}_r$, which quantifies the balance
between the fluctuations of kinetic energy at the forcing length scale
$\ell_{\rm f}$ and the total energy $E_0$. We find that the system exhibits a
transition from a high-enstrophy phase at small $\mathcal{R}_r$, where
truncation effects tend to produce partially thermalized states, to a
hydrodynamical phase with low enstrophy at large $\mathcal{R}_r$. Using
insights from a diffusion model of turbulence (Leith model), we argue that the
transition is in fact akin to a continuous phase transition, where
$\mathcal{R}_r$ indeed behaves as a thermodynamic control parameter, e.g., a
temperature, the enstrophy plays the role of an order parameter, while the
symmetry breaking parameter $h$ is (one over) the truncation scale $k_{\rm
max}$. We find that the signatures of the phase transition close to the
critical point $\mathcal{R}_r^\star$ can essentially be deduced from a
heuristic mean-field Landau free energy. This point of view allows us to
reinterpret the relevant asymptotics in which the dynamical ensemble
equivalence conjectured by Gallavotti, Phys.Lett.A, 223, 1996 could hold true.
Our numerics indicate that the low-order statistics of the 3D RNS are indeed
qualitatively similar to those observed in direct numerical simulations of the
standard Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with viscosity chosen so as to match the
average value of the reversible viscosity.

nanowire junctions arXiv:1807.01940 (2018), strong anisotropic suppression of
induced superconductivity has been observed in tunnel conductance measurements
in the presence of applied magnetic field with variable orientation. Following
this finding, we investigate theoretically the dependence of tunnel conductance
on the direction of the Zeeman field in order to understand the operational
mechanisms and to extract effective system parameters. Second, motivated by a
generic discrepancy between experiment and theory, i.e., many in-gap and
above-gap conductance features predicted by theory are barely observed in
experiments, we study several mechanisms possibly responsible for the
suppression of the theoretically predicted conductance features (e.g., length
of the nanowire, self-energy effect due to the proximity effect, finite
temperature, finite dissipation, and multiband effect). One essential finding
in the current work is that only by a combined understanding of both
suppression mechanisms can we extract effective system parameters from the
experimental data (e.g., the effective nanowire-superconductor coupling, the
effective Land\'e $g$ factor, and the chemical potential of the semiconducting
nanowire). In addition, we consider topologically trivial Andreev bound states
in hybrid nanowires in the presence of potential inhomogeneities, such as
external quantum dots or potential inhomogeneities inside the nanowire. We
compare the anisotropic, field-dependent features induced by these
nontopological Andreev bound states with the corresponding features produced by
topological Majorana zero modes in pristine nanostructures, so that we can
provide guidance to differentiate between the topologically trivial and
nontrivial cases.

space and time observations in variational data assimilation problems. Within
the framework of supervised learning, we consider a bilevel problem where the
lower-level task is the variational reconstruction of the initial condition of
a semilinear system, and the upper-level problem solves the optimal placement
with help of a sparsity inducing function. Due to the pointwise nature of the
observations, an optimality system with regular Borel measures is obtained as
necessary optimality condition for the lower-level problem. The latter is then
considered as constraint for the upper-level instance, yielding an optimization
problem constrained by a multi-state system with measures. We demonstrate
existence of Lagrange multipliers and derive a necessary optimality system
characterizing the optimal solution of the bilevel problem. The numerical
solution is carried out also on two levels. The lower-level problem is solved
using a standard BFGS method, while the upper-level one is solved by means of a
projected BFGS algorithm based on the estimation of $\epsilon$-active sets.
Finally some numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the main
features of our approach.

the evolution of a mixture of interstellar gas and CRs, in which turbulence is
driven by stochastic forcing within a box of 40 pc. We explore a large
parameter space (CR diffusion coefficient, magnetisation, driving scale and
amplitude of the turbulence forcing, initial CR energy). We identify a clear
transition in the interstellar dynamics for CR diffusion coefficient below a
critical value, which depends on the characteristic length scale L as $D_{\rm
crit}\simeq 3.1~10^{23}~{\rm~cm^2/s}~(L/{\rm 1~pc})^{q+1}$, where the exponent
q relates the turbulent velocity dispersion to the length scale as $v\simeq
L^q$. In our simulations this transition occurs around $D_{\rm crit}\simeq
10^{24-25}$ cm^2/s. The transition is recovered in all cases of our parameter
study and is in very good agreement with our simple analytical estimate. In the
trapped CR regime, the induced CR pressure gradients can modify the gas flow

possible mechanisms that can reduce significantly the CR diffusion coefficients

  Person Re-identification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Person re-identification is to retrieval pedestrian images from no-overlap
camera views detected by pedestrian detectors. Most existing person
re-identification (re-ID) models often fail to generalize well from the source
domain where the models are trained to a new target domain without labels,
because of the bias between the source and target domain. This issue
significantly limits the scalability and usability of the models in the real
world. Providing a labeled source training set and an unlabeled target training
set, the aim of this paper is to improve the generalization ability of re-ID
models to the target domain. To this end, we propose an image generative
network named identity preserving generative adversarial network (IPGAN). The
proposed method has two excellent properties: 1) only a single model is
employed to translate the labeled images from the source domain to the target
camera domains in an unsupervised manner; 2) The identity information of images
from the source domain is preserved before and after translation. Furthermore,
we propose IBN-reID model for the person re-identification task. It has better
generalization ability than baseline models, especially in the cases without
any domain adaptation. The IBN-reID model is trained on the translated images
by supervised methods. Experimental results on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID
show that the images generated by IPGAN are more suitable for cross-domain
person re-identification. Very competitive re-ID accuracy is achieved by our
method.

projective representation of the Weyl-Heisenberg group over any finite abelian
group. The minimal sets of linearly dependent vectors, the so-called binder, of
the Gabor-Steiner equiangular tight frames are then characterized; under

to measure the goodness of a speech enhancement algorithm (SEA) without

like PESQ and STOI for evaluating the speech quality and intelligibility were
verified to have relatively low correlations with WER. In this study, a novel
acoustics-guided evaluation (AGE) measure is proposed for estimating
performance of SEAs for robust ASR. AGE consists of three consecutive steps,
namely the low-level representations via the feature extraction, high-level
representations via the nonlinear mapping with the acoustic model (AM), and the
final AGE calculation between the representations of clean speech and degraded
speech. Specifically, state posterior probabilities from neural network based
AM are adopted for the high-level representations and the cross-entropy
criterion is used to calculate AGE. Experiments demonstrate AGE could yield
consistently highest correlations with WER and give the most accurate
estimation of ASR performance compared with PESQ, STOI, and acoustic confidence
measure using Entropy. Potentially, AGE could be adopted to guide the parameter
optimization of deep learning based SEAs to further improve the recognition
performance.

  A Kelvin-Helmholtz stability analysis for the differential two-fluid model is
in the present work presented and extended to discrete representations of said

quantitative information into i) when a studied scheme will predict linear wave
growth, ii) the rate of growth and the expected growing wavelength, and iii)
the wave speeds. These stability expressions adhere to a wider family of finite
volume methods, directly applicable to any specific formulation within this
group. Both the spatial and temporal discretization are found to play decisive
roles in a method's predictive capability. Fundamental aspects of how numerical
errors from the temporal integration affects the predicted stability are
explored. Numerical errors are observed to manifest in increased, as well as
reduced, wave growth. Low-frequency growth from numerical errors is not always
easily distinguished from physical wave growth. The linear analysis is
demonstrated to be useful in understanding the predictions made by simulator

the problem of mapping a disease mention in free-form text to a concept in a
controlled vocabulary, usually to the standard thesaurus in the Unified Medical
Language System (UMLS). This task is challenging since medical terminology is
very different when coming from health care professionals or from the general
public in the form of social media texts. We approach it as a sequence learning
problem, with recurrent neural networks trained to obtain semantic
representations of one- and multi-word expressions. We develop end-to-end
neural architectures tailored specifically to medical concept normalization,
including bidirectional LSTM and GRU with an attention mechanism and additional
semantic similarity features based on UMLS. Our evaluation over a standard
benchmark shows that our model improves over a state of the art baseline for
classification based on CNNs.

the video segments containing human actions in an untrimmed video. In this
paper, we propose a multi-granularity generator (MGG) to perform the temporal
action proposal from different granularity perspectives, relying on the video
visual features equipped with the position embedding information. First, we
propose to use a bilinear matching model to exploit the rich local information
within the video sequence. Afterwards, two components, namely segment proposal
producer (SPP) and frame actionness producer (FAP), are combined to perform the
task of temporal action proposal at two distinct granularities. SPP considers
the whole video in the form of feature pyramid and generates segment proposals
from one coarse perspective, while FAP carries out a finer actionness
evaluation for each video frame. Our proposed MGG can be trained in an
end-to-end fashion. By temporally adjusting the segment proposals with
fine-grained frame actionness information, MGG achieves the superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods on the public THUMOS-14 and
ActivityNet-1.3 datasets. Moreover, we employ existing action classifiers to
perform the classification of the proposals generated by MGG, leading to
significant improvements compared against the competing methods for the video
detection task.

of decompositions of measures into mixtures of product-like components, where
the goal is to attain a decomposition into measures whose entropy is close to
that of the original measure, yet with small correlations between coordinates.
We prove a related general result: For every isotropic measure $\mu$ on
$\mathbb{R}^n$ and every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a decomposition $\mu =
\int \mu_\theta d m(\theta)$ such that $H(\mu) - \mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim m}
H(\mu_\theta) \leq n \epsilon$ and $\mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim m}
\mathrm{Cov}(\mu_\theta) \preceq \mathrm{Id}/\epsilon$. As an application, we
prove a general bound for the mean-field approximation of Ising and Potts
models, which is in a sense dimension free, in both continuous and discrete
settings. In particular, for an Ising model on $\{\pm 1 \}^n$ or on $[-1,1]^n$,
we show that the deficit between the mean-field approximation and the free
energy is at most $C \frac{1+p}{p} \left ( n\|J\|_{S_p} \right)^{\frac{p}{1+p}}

underrepresentation of women in computing an increasingly important issue.
Online question and answer platforms serve a dual purpose in this field: they
form a body of knowledge useful as a reference and learning tool, and they
provide opportunities for individuals to demonstrate credible, verifiable
expertise. Issues, such as male-oriented site design or overrepresentation of
men among the site's elite may therefore compound the issue of women's
underrepresentation in IT. In this paper we audit the differences in behavior
and outcomes between men and women on Stack Overflow, the most popular of these
Q&A sites. We observe significant differences in how men and women participate
in the platform and how successful they are. For example, the average woman has
roughly half of the reputation points, the primary measure of success on the
site, of the average man. Using an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, an econometric
technique commonly applied to analyze differences in wages between groups, we
find that most of the gap in success between men and women can be explained by
differences in their activity on the site and differences in how these
activities are rewarded. Specifically, 1) men give more answers than women and
2) are rewarded more for their answers on average, even when controlling for
possible confounders such as tenure or buy-in to the site. Women ask more
questions and gain more reward per question. We conclude with a hypothetical
redesign of the site's scoring system based on these behavioral differences,
cutting the reputation gap in half.

A
common example arises in collecting network data: we often obtain network
datasets by recording all of the interactions among a small set of core nodes,
so that we end up with a measurement of the network consisting of these core
nodes along with a potentially much larger set of fringe nodes that have links
to the core. Given the ubiquity of this process for assembling network data, it
is crucial to understand the role of such a `core-fringe' structure.
  Here we study how the inclusion of fringe nodes affects the standard task of
network link prediction. One might initially think the inclusion of any
additional data is useful, and hence that it should be beneficial to include
all fringe nodes that are available. However, we find that this is not true; in
fact, there is substantial variability in the value of the fringe nodes for
prediction. Once an algorithm is selected, in some datasets, including any
additional data from the fringe can actually hurt prediction performance; in
other datasets, including some amount of fringe information is useful before
prediction performance saturates or even declines; and in further cases,
including the entire fringe leads to the best performance. While such variety
might seem surprising, we show that these behaviors are exhibited by simple
random graph models.

  publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stz2976",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite being hard to measure, GRB prompt $\gamma$-ray emission polarization
is a valuable probe of the dominant emission mechanism and the outflow's
composition and angular structure. During the prompt emission the outflow is
ultra-relativistic with Lorentz factors $\Gamma\gg1$. We describe in detail the
linear polarization properties of various emission mechanisms: synchrotron
radiation from different magnetic field structures (ordered: toroidal $B_{\rm
tor}$ or radial $B_\parallel$, and random: normal to the radial direction
$B_\perp$), Compton drag, and photospheric emission. We calculate the
polarization for different GRB jet angular structures (e.g. top-hat, Gaussian,
power-law) and viewing angles $\theta_{\rm obs}$. Synchrotron with $B_\perp$
can produce large polarizations, up to $25\%\lesssim\Pi\lesssim45\%$, for a
top-hat jet but only for lines of sight just outside the jet's sharp edge. The
same also holds for Compton drag, albeit with a slightly higher overall $\Pi$.
Moreover, we demonstrate how $\Gamma$-variations during the GRB or smoother jet
edges would significantly reduce $\Pi$. We construct a semi-analytic model for
non-dissipative photospheric emission from structured jets. Such emission can
produce up to $\Pi\lesssim15\%$ with reasonably high fluences, but this
requires steep gradients in $\Gamma(\theta)$. A polarization of
$50\%\lesssim\Pi\lesssim65\%$ can robustly be produced only by synchrotron
emission from a transverse magnetic field ordered on angles $\gtrsim\!1/\Gamma$
around our line of sight (like a global toroidal field). Therefore, such a
model would be strongly favored even by a single secure measurement within this
range. We find that such a model would also be favored if $\Pi\gtrsim20\%$ is
measured in most GRBs within a large enough sample, by deriving the
polarization distribution for our different emission and jet models.

observations (or measurements) and their resolution in the context of radar
range estimation. To this end, we introduce a novel estimation scheme that can
deal with strongly quantized received signals, going as low as 1-bit per signal
sample. We leverage for this a dithered quantized compressive sensing framework
that can be applied to classic radar processing and hardware. This allows us to
remove ambiguous scenarios prohibiting correct range estimation from
(undithered) quantized base-band radar signal. Two range estimation algorithms
are studied: Projected Back Projection (PBP) and Quantized Iterative Hard
Thresholding (QIHT). The effectiveness of the reconstruction methods combined
with the dithering strategy is shown through Monte Carlo simulations.
Furthermore we show that: (i), in dithered quantization, the accuracy of target
range estimation improves when the bit-rate (i.e., the total number of measured
bits) increases, whereas the accuracy of other undithered schemes saturate in
this case; and (ii), for fixed, low bit-rate scenarios, severely quantized
dithered schemes exhibit better performances than their full resolution
counterparts. These observations are confirmed using real measurements obtained
in a controlled environment, demonstrating the feasibility of the method in
real ranging applications.

functions often assume a Gaussian likelihood function with a fixed covariance
matrix. We study the impact on cosmological parameter estimation of ignoring
the parameter dependence of this covariance matrix, focusing on the particular
case of joint weak-lensing and galaxy clustering analyses. Using a Fisher
matrix formalism (calibrated against exact likelihood evaluation in particular
simple cases), we quantify the effect of using a parameter dependent covariance
matrix on both the bias and variance of the parameters. We confirm that the
approximation of a parameter-independent covariance matrix is exceptionally
good in all realistic scenarios. The information content in the covariance
matrix (in comparison with the two point functions themselves) does not change
with the fractional sky coverage. Therefore the increase in information due to
the parameter dependent covariance matrix becomes negligible as the number of
modes increases. Even for surveys covering less than $1\%$ of the sky, this
effect only causes a bias of up to ${\cal O}(10\%)$ of the statistical
uncertainties, with a misestimation of the parameter uncertainties at the same
level or lower. The effect will only be smaller with future large-area surveys.
Thus for most analyses the effect of a parameter-dependent covariance matrix
can be ignored both in terms of the accuracy and precision of the recovered
cosmological constraints.

thermoelectrics. Favorable improvements in thermal conductivity are attainable
in many material systems, and theoretical work points to large improvements in
electronic properties. However, realization of the electronic benefits in
practical materials has been elusive experimentally. A key challenge is that
experimental identification of the quantum confinement length, below which the
thermoelectric power factor is significantly enhanced, remains elusive due to
lack of simultaneous control of size and carrier density. Here we investigate
gate tunable and temperature-dependent thermoelectric transport in $\gamma$
phase indium selenide ($\gamma$ InSe, n type semiconductor) samples with
thickness varying from 7 to 29 nm. This allows us to properly map out dimension
and doping space. Combining theoretical and experimental studies, we reveal
that the sharper pre-edge of the conduction-band density of states arising from
quantum confinement gives rise to an enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and
the power factor in the thinner InSe samples. Most importantly, we
experimentally identify the role of the competition between quantum confinement
length and thermal de Broglie wavelength in the enhancement of power factor.
Our results provide an important and general experimental guideline for
optimizing the power factor and improving the thermoelectric performance of
two-dimensional layered semiconductors.

Recent studies show that ""attendance"" is the most common metric used to capture
the success of social events, since the number of attendees has great impact on
the event's expected gains (e.g., revenue, artist/brand publicity). In this
work, we study the Social Event Scheduling (SES) problem which aims at
identifying and assigning social events to appropriate time slots, so that the
number of events attendees is maximized. We show that, even in highly
restricted instances, the SES problem is NP-hard to be approximated over a

algorithms. These algorithms exploit several novel schemes that we design. We
conduct extensive experiments using several real and synthetic datasets, and
demonstrate that the proposed algorithms perform on average half the

an algorithm from a given set is known as the per-instance algorithm selection
problem and has been intensely studied over the past 15 years, leading to major
improvements in the state of the art in solving a growing number of discrete
combinatorial problems, including propositional satisfiability and AI planning.
Per-instance algorithm selection also shows much promise for boosting

around 0.85 GPa, the superconducting transition shows a narrow width with no
indication of antiferromagnetic order. While above this pressure, the
superconducting transition temperature drops slightly forming a small dome of
superconducting region with the maximum $T_c$ at around 0.825 GPa. Furthermore,
just above this pressure, the superconducting transition exhibits an unusual
large transition width which reaches about 6-8 K. This wide transition width is
an intrinsic feature and does not change with magnetic field. In the high
pressure region above 1.18 GPa, just accompanying the onset of superconducting
transition, an upturn of resistivity immediately occurs, which is attributed to
the formation of an antiferromagnetic order. This closely attached behavior of
superconductivity and antiferromagnetic order indicates that these two orders
have a synergy feature. Near the critical pressure 0.825 GPa and below, our
data illustrate that an antiferromagnetic order emerges when superconductivity
is suppressed. From the weak influence of magnetic field to the
antiferromagnetic order, we conclude that it exists already below the small

were able to detect and assign more than 100 rotational lines. The new lines
have significantly enhanced the previous data set allowing the determination of
highly precise rotational and centrifugal distortion parameters. In our
analysis we have taken into account the interaction between the ground
electronic state and a low-lying excited state (Renner-Teller pair) which
enables the prediction and assignment of rotational transitions with $K_a$ up

well-known variational formulation based on Hamilton's principle and the
Lagrangian, to which is associated a Hamiltonian formulation that involves a
Poisson bracket structure. These variational and bracket structures underlie
many of the most basic principles that we know about geophysical fluid flows,
such as conservation laws. However, real geophysical flows also include
irreversible processes, such as viscous dissipation, heat conduction, diffusion
and phase changes. Recent work has demonstrated that the variational
formulation can be extended to include irreversible processes and
non-equilibrium thermodynamics, through the new concept of thermodynamic
displacement. By design, and in accordance with fundamental physical
principles, the resulting equations automatically satisfy the first and second
law of thermodynamics. Irreversible processes can also be incorporated into the
bracket structure through the addition of a dissipation bracket. This gives
what are known as the single and double generator bracket formulations, which
are the natural generalizations of the Hamiltonian formulation to include
irreversible dynamics. Here the variational formulation for irreversible
processes is shown to underlie these bracket formulations for fully
compressible, multicomponent, multiphase geophysical fluids with a single
temperature and velocity. Many previous results in the literature are
demonstrated to be special cases of this approach. Finally, some limitations of

forward pass. The introduced appearance module learns a probabilistic
generative model of target and background feature distributions. Given a new
image, it predicts the posterior class probabilities, providing a highly
discriminative cue, which is processed in later network modules. Both the
learning and prediction stages of our appearance module are fully
differentiable, enabling true end-to-end training of the entire segmentation
pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach on three video object segmentation benchmarks. We close the
gap to approaches based on online fine-tuning on DAVIS17, while operating at 15
FPS on a single GPU. Furthermore, our method outperforms all published
approaches on the large-scale YouTube-VOS dataset.

reaches a given threshold value for the first time, is a fundamental
mathematical concept with immediate applications. In particular, it quantifies
the statistics of instances when biomolecules in a biological cell reach their
specific binding sites and trigger cellular regulation. Typically, the
first-passage properties are given in terms of mean first-passage times.
However, modern experiments now monitor single-molecular binding-processes in
living cells and thus provide access to the full statistics of the underlying
first-passage events, in particular, inherent cell-to-cell fluctuations. We
here present a robust explicit approach for obtaining the distribution of FPTs
to a small partially-reactive target in cylindrical-annulus domains, which
represent typical bacterial and neuronal cell shapes. We investigate various
asymptotic behaviours of this FPT distribution and show that it typically is
very broad in many biological situations: thus, the mean FPT can differ from
the most probable FPT by orders of magnitude. The most probable FPT is shown to
strongly depend only on the starting position within the geometry and to be
almost independent of the target size and reactivity. These findings
demonstrate the dramatic relevance of knowing the full distribution of FPTs and
thus open new perspectives for a more reliable description of many
intracellular processes initiated by the arrival of one or few biomolecules to
a small, spatially localised region inside the cell.

for galactic wind and a heuristic halo mass-based quenching prescription. We
run two zoom-in simulations of galaxy groups with $M_{halo}>10^{13}M_\odot$ at
z=0, selected to have quiet merger histories. We track galaxies as they become
satellites, and compute the delay time $\tau_{d}$ during which the satellites
are similar to central galaxies at a given stellar mass, and a fading time
$\tau_{f}$ during which satellites go from gas-rich and star-forming to
gas-poor and quiescent. We find $0.7< \tau_{d}< 3$ Gyr at $z=0$, and depends
inversely on the satellite halo mass at infall. At z ~ 1 we find ~$0.3<
\tau_{d} < 2$ Gyr, broadly consistent with a positive correlation with the
Hubble time. For a given halo mass, lower stellar mass galaxies at infall time
have higher $\tau_{d}$. We generally find $\tau_{f}\ll \tau_{d}$, ranging
between ~ 150 Myr at z~0 and ~ 80 Myr at z ~ 1 based on linear interpolation,
with some uncertainty because they are smaller than our simulation output
frequency ($200-300$ Myr). $\tau_{f}$ has no obvious dependency on infall halo
mass. Both timescales show little difference between HI depletion and SF
quenching, indicating that using up the gas reservoir by star formation without
refilling is the main mechanism to transform satellite galaxies at these halo
masses. At a given physical distance from the center of the main halo of
interest, higher redshift galaxies have on average higher cold gas content, but
the ratio of gas (HI or H$_2$) to star formation rate is similar, indicating
that star formation is consistently fed through reservoirs of HI then H$_2$.
For a given amount of HI, galaxies have shorter consumption times in more
massive halo structures.

histories over cosmic time. Due to their low surface brightnesses and complex
morphologies, existing automated methods struggle to detect such features and
most work to date has heavily relied on visual inspection. This presents a
major obstacle to quantitative study of tidal debris features in large
statistical samples, and hence the ability to be able to use these features to
advance understanding of the galaxy population as a whole. This paper uses
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dropout and augmentation to identify
galaxies in the CFHTLS-Wide Survey that have faint tidal features. Evaluating
the performance of the CNNs against previously-published expert visual
classifications, we find that our method achieves high (76%) completeness and
low (20%) contamination, and also performs considerably better than other
automated methods recently applied in the literature. We argue that CNNs offer
a promising approach to effective automatic identification of low surface
brightness tidal debris features in and around galaxies. When applied to
forthcoming deep wide-field imaging surveys (e.g. LSST, Euclid), CNNs have the
potential to provide a several order-of-magnitude increase in the sample size
of morphologically-perturbed galaxies and thereby facilitate a much-anticipated
revolution in terms of quantitative low surface brightness science.

radiation. The identified circulation patterns are largely consistent with
theory. The slow modes, MJO and ER, mainly impact precipitable water, whereas
the faster Kelvin waves, MRGs, and TDs primarily modulate moisture convergence.
Monsoonal inflow intensifies during wet phases of the MJO, ERs, and MRGs,
associated with a northward shift of the intertropical discontinuity for MJO
and ERs. During passages of vertically tilted imbalanced wave modes, such as
MJO, Kelvin waves, and TDs, and partly MRGs, increased vertical wind shear and

six wave types on precipitation over northern tropical Africa during the
transition and full monsoon seasons, using two satellite products and a dense
rain gauge network. Composites of rainfall anomalies in the different datasets
show} comparable modulation intensities in the West Sahel and at the Guinea
Coast, varying from less than 2 to above 7 mm/d depending on the wave type.
African Easterly Waves (AEWs) and Kelvin waves dominate the 3-hourly to daily

MJO and equatorial Rossby (ER) waves remain as modulating factors and explain
about up to one third of rainfall variability. Eastward inertio-gravity waves

of wave superposition shows that low-frequency waves (MJO, ER) in their wet

tropical waves when forecasting rainfall over northern tropical Africa.

comparing and indexing time series. Especially, when the comparison should not

function ($\texttt{DTW}$) is one of the most analyzed time series distance
functions. The Dog-Keeper distance ($\texttt{DK}$) is another example for a
distance function on time series which is truely invariant under time warping.
  For many application scenarios (e.$\,$g. motion gesture recognition in
virtual reality), the invariance under isometric spatial transformations
(i.$\,$e. rotation, translation, and mirroring) is as important as the
invariance under time warping. Distance functions on time series which are
invariant under isometric transformations can be seen as measurements for the
congruency of two time series. The congruence distance ($\texttt{CD}$) is an
example for such a distance function. However, it is very hard to compute and
it is not invariant under time warpings.
  In this work, we are taking one step towards developing a feasable distance
function which is invariant under isometric spatial transformations and time
warping: We develop four approximations for $\texttt{CD}$. Two of these even
satisfy the triangle inequality and can thus be used with metric indexing
structures. We show that all approximations serve as a lower bound to
$\texttt{CD}$. Our evaluation shows that they achieve remarkable tightness

studies we aim to fill this gap. Study 1 (N = 11) compares how data assessed
with RFID badges correspond with video data of the same interactions (construct
validity) and how this fit can be improved using straightforward data
processing strategies. The analyses show that the RFID badges have a
sensitivity of 50% that can be enhanced to 65% when flickering signals with
gaps of less than 75 seconds are interpolated. The specificity is relatively
less affected by this interpolation process (before interpolation 97%, after
interpolation 94.7%) - resulting in an improved accuracy of the measurement. In
Study 2 (N = 73) we show that self-report data of social interactions
correspond highly with data gathered with the RFID badges (criterion validity).

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1811.01982",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The typical binding energy of heavy hadron spectroscopy makes the system
accessible to perturbative calculations in terms of non-relativistic QCD.
Within NRQCD the predictions of heavy quarkonium energy levels rely on the
accurate description of the static QCD potential $V_{\rm QCD}(r)$.
  Historically, heavy quarkonium spectroscopy was studied using
phenomenological approaches such as the Cornell model $V_{\rm
Cornell}=-\kappa/r+\sigma\, r$, which assumes a short-distance dominant Coulomb
potential plus a liner rising potential that emerges at long distances. Such
model works reasonably well in describing the charmonium and bottomonium
spectroscopy. However, even when there are physically-motivated arguments for
the construction of the Cornell model, there is no conection a priori with QCD
parameters.
  Based on a previous work on heavy meson spectroscopy, we calibrate the
Cornell model with NRQCD predictions for the lowest lying bottomonium states at
N$^3$LO, in which the bottom mass is varied within a wide range. We show that
the Cornell model mass parameter can be identified with the low-scale
short-distance MSR mass at the scale $R = 1$ GeV. This identification holds for
any value of $\alpha_s$ or the bottom mass. For moderate values of $r$, the
NRQCD and Cornell static potentials are in head-on agreement when switching the
pole mass to the MSR scheme, which allows to simultaneously cancel the
renormalon and sum up large logarithms.

phase of the subharmonic component of the perturbation that has a wavelength
double that of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. If the phase relationship
between the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode and its subharmonic mode is optimal, or close
to it, vortex pairing occurs. Vortex paring is delayed when there is a phase
difference, and this delay increases with increasing phase difference. In three
dimensional simulations vortex pairing is suppressed if the phase difference is
sufficiently large, reducing the amount of mixing and mixing efficiency. For a
given phase difference close enough to the optimal phase, the response of the
flow to eigenvalues perturbations is very similar to the response to random
perturbations. In addition to traditional diagnostics, we show quantitatively
that a non-modal Fourier component in a random perturbation quickly evolves to

an exceptionally rich dataset that can be used to understand and predict player

valuable players and foresee the amount of money they will spend in in-app

up to 50% of the revenue is generated by just around 2% of the players, the
so-called whales.
  To address this challenge, we explore how deep neural networks can be used to
predict customer lifetime value in video games, and compare their performance
to parametric models such as Pareto/NBD. Our results suggest that convolutional
neural network structures are the most efficient in predicting the economic
value of individual players. They not only perform better in terms of accuracy,
but also scale to big data and significantly reduce computational time, as they
can work directly with raw sequential data and thus do not require any feature
engineering process. This becomes important when datasets are very large, as is
often the case with video game logs.
  Moreover, convolutional neural networks are particularly well suited to
identify potential whales. Such an early identification is of paramount
importance for business purposes, as it would allow developers to implement
in-game actions aimed at retaining big spenders and maximizing their lifetime,

networks (CNN), involve heavy computation and require hardware, such as CPU,
GPU, and AI accelerators, to provide the massive computing power. With the many
varieties of AI hardware prevailing on the market, it is often hard to decide
which one is the best to use. Thus, benchmarking AI hardware effectively
becomes important and is of great help to select and optimize AI hardware.
Unfortunately, there are few AI benchmarks available in both academia and
industry. Examples are BenchNN[1], DeepBench[2], and Dawn Bench[3], which are
usually a collection of typical real DNN applications. While these benchmarks
provide performance comparison across different AI hardware, they suffer from a
number of drawbacks. First, they cannot adapt to the emerging changes of DNN
algorithms and are fixed once selected. Second, they contain tens to hundreds
of applications and take very long time to finish running. Third, they are
mainly selected from open sources, which are restricted by copyright and are
not representable to proprietary applications. In this work, a synthetic
benchmarks framework is firstly proposed to address the above drawbacks of AI
benchmarks. Instead of pre-selecting a set of open-sourced benchmarks and
running all of them, the synthetic approach generates only a one or few
benchmarks that best represent a broad range of applications using profiled
workload characteristics data of these applications. Thus, it can adapt to
emerging changes of new DNN algorithms by re-profiling new applications and
updating itself, greatly reduce benchmark count and running time, and strongly
represent DNN applications of interests. The generated benchmarks are called AI
Matrix, serving as a performance benchmarks matching the statistical workload
characteristics of a combination of applications of interests.

measuring the word-error rate (WER). This suggests that predicting sequences of
words directly may be helpful instead. However, training with word-level
supervision can be more difficult due to the sparsity of examples per label
class. In this paper we analyze an end-to-end ASR model that combines a
word-and-character representation in a multi-task learning (MTL) framework. We
show that it improves on the WER and study how the word-level model can benefit
from character-level supervision by analyzing the learned inductive preference
bias of each model component empirically. We find that by adding
character-level supervision, the MTL model interpolates between recognizing
more frequent words (preferred by the word-level model) and shorter words
(preferred by the character-level model).

  Human Collective Intelligence",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The pictorial jigsaw (PJ) puzzle is a well-known leisure game for humans.
Usually, a PJ puzzle game is played by one or several human players
face-to-face in the physical space. In this paper, we focus on how to solve PJ
puzzles in the cyberspace by a group of physically distributed human players.
We propose an approach to solving PJ puzzle by stigmergy-inspired
Internet-based human collective intelligence. The core of the approach is a
continuously executing loop, named the EIF loop, which consists of three
activities: exploration, integration, and feedback. In exploration, each player
tries to solve the PJ puzzle alone, without direct interactions with other
players. At any time, the result of a player's exploration is a partial
solution to the PJ puzzle, and a set of rejected neighboring relation between
pieces. The results of all players' exploration are integrated in real time
through integration, with the output of a continuously updated collective
opinion graph (COG). And through feedback, each player is provided with
personalized feedback information based on the current COG and the player's
exploration result, in order to accelerate his/her puzzle-solving process.
Exploratory experiments show that: (1) supported by this approach, the time to
solve PJ puzzle is nearly linear to the reciprocal of the number of players,
and shows better scalability to puzzle size than that of face-to-face
collaboration for 10-player groups; (2) for groups with 2 to 10 players, the
puzzle-solving time decreases 31.36%-64.57% on average, compared with the best
single players in the experiments.

and non-Gaussian noise, whose statistics and spectrum depend on two parameters,
$q$ and $\tau$. Inspired by Tsallis' nonextensive formulation of statistical
physics, the so-called $q$-distribution is a handy source of self-correlated
noise for a large range of applications. The $q$-noise -- which tends smoothly
for $q=1$ to Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noise with autocorrelation $\tau$ -- is
generated via a stochastic differential equation, using the Heun method (a
second order Runge--Kutta type integration scheme). The algorithm is
implemented as a stand-alone library in C++, and is made available as open
source in the Github repository. Noise' statistics can be specified handily; by
only varying parameter $q$: it has compact support for $q<1$ (sub-Gaussian
regime) and finite variance up to $q=5/3$ (supra-Gaussian regime). Once $q$ is
fixed, noise' autocorrelation can be tuned independently by means of parameter
$\tau$. The presented qNoise generator provides a readily tool to modeling wide
range of real-world noise types, and is suitable to study the effects of
correlation and deviations from the normal distribution in systems of
stochastic differential equations, key to understand system dynamics in
numerous applications. The effect of noises' statistics on the response of a
range of nonlinear systems is briefly discussed. In many of these examples, the
systems' response turns optimal for some $q\neq1$. Hence, this paper aims to
introduce qNoise generator for C++ at the class level and evaluate the kind of
noise it generates, alongside their use in a range of applications.

EI and translate scientific terminology into operational language to inform
society. We propose an approach that simplifies marine ecosystem complexity by
applying scientific knowledge to identify which components reflect the state or
state change of ecosystems. It follows a bottom-up structure that identifies,
based on expert knowledge, biological components related with past and present
changing conditions. It is structured in 5 stages that interact in an adaptive
way: stage 1, in situ observations suggest changes could be happening; stage 2
explores available data that represent EI; stage 3, experts' workshops target
the identification of the minimum set of variables needed to define EI, or the
risk of losing EI; an optative stage 4, where deviance from EI, or risk of
deviance, is statistically assessed; stage 5, findings are communicated to
society. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness in three case studies,
including a data poor situation, an area where lack of reference sites hampers
the identification of historical changes, and an area where diffuse sources of
stress make it difficult to identify simple relationships with of ecological
responses. The future challenge is to operationalize the approach and trigger
desirable society actions to strengthen a social-nature link.

concerning both structural changes of the ion conducting material and of the
ion conducting mechanism. The posed structural hypotheses are oxygen sub
lattice melting, phase change of the ion conducting material, and that the
heterolayer environment does not induce a phase change of the ion conducting
material. The posed mechanistic hypotheses are disorder, mechanics, and space
charge. Here, first principles molecular dynamics and statics of the ion
conducting interface are performed providing evidence that under CIC conditions
no sub lattice melting nor phase change has occurred and that the electrolyte
remains unchanged. A discussion of the posed mechanistic hypotheses is given
