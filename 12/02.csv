mechanism is arbitrarily assembled, the kinematic configurations may be
inaccurate or unknown, violating ideal rotation. These discrepancies in the
model with the real physics result in erroneous servo manipulation of the

pan-tilt rotations as motion along great circle trajectories and calibrates its

Then, one can accurately servo pan-tilt rotations with pose estimation from
inverse kinematics of their transformation. The comparative experiment

given the challenge that it is not always possible to obtain out of

independent of specific knowledge of out of distribution samples. From this
existing work, we also know that having access to the true out of sample
distribution for regularization works significantly better than using samples
from the GAN. In this paper, we make the following observation: in practice,
the out of distribution samples are contained in the traffic that hits a
deployed classifier. However, the traffic will also contain a unknown
proportion of in-distribution samples. If the entropy over of all of the
traffic data were to be naively maximized, this will hurt the classifier
performance on in-distribution data. To effectively leverage this traffic data,
we propose an adaptive regularization technique (based on the maximum
predictive probability score of a sample) which penalizes out of distribution
samples more heavily than in distribution samples in the incoming traffic. This
ensures that the overall performance of the classifier does not degrade on
in-distribution data, while detection of out-of-distribution samples is
significantly improved by leveraging the unlabeled traffic data. We show the
effectiveness of our method via experiments on natural image datasets.

the movement of the camera that is bound by the two rotation axes of the servo

Subsequently, fast global registration can be performed during online operation
with transformation matrices formed by the calibrated rotation axes and angles.
In local registration, features are extracted and matched between two scenes.
False-positive correspondences, whose distances to the rotation trajectories
exceed a threshold, are rejected. Then, a more accurate registration can be
achieved by minimizing the residual distances between corresponding points,
while transformations are bound to the rotation axes. Finally, the preliminary
alignment result is input to the iterative closed point algorithm to compute
the final transformation. Results of comparative experiments validate that the

Given a family of subsets $\mathcal{S}\subset 2^{[n]}$, we provide a single
streaming algorithm that can $(1\pm \epsilon)$-approximate the subset-norm for
every $S\in\mathcal{S}$. Here, the subset-$\ell_p$-norm of $v\in \mathbb{R}^n$
with respect to set $S\subseteq [n]$ is the $\ell_p$-norm of vector $v_{|S}$
(which denotes restricting $v$ to $S$, by zeroing all other coordinates).
  Our main result is a near-tight characterization of the space complexity of
every family $\mathcal{S}\subset 2^{[n]}$ of subset-$\ell_0$-norms in
insertion-only streams, expressed in terms of the ""heavy-hitter dimension"" of
$\mathcal{S}$, a new combinatorial quantity that is related to the VC-dimension
of $\mathcal{S}$. In contrast, we show that the more general turnstile and
sliding-window models require a much larger space usage. All these results
easily extend to $\ell_1$.
  In addition, we design algorithms for two other subset-$\ell_p$-norm
variants. These can be compared to the Priority Sampling algorithm of Duffield,
Lund and Thorup [JACM 2007], which achieves additive approximation
$\epsilon\|{v}\|$ for all possible subsets ($\mathcal{S}=2^{[n]}$) in the
entry-wise update model. One of our algorithms extends this algorithm to handle
turnstile updates, and another one achieves multiplicative approximation given
a family $\mathcal{S}$.

the degenerate ground state of the topological superconductor to be dressed in
a polaron-like manner by quasi-particle states and bosons, and the system to
become gapless. Topological protection and hence full coherence is only
maintained if the qubit is operated and read out within the low-energy spectrum

industry, and governments due to the growing number of malicious insider
incidents. The existing approaches proposed for detecting insider threats still
have a common shortcoming, which is the high number of false alarms (false
positives). The challenge in these approaches is that it is essential to detect
all anomalous behaviours which belong to a particular threat. To address this
shortcoming, we propose an opportunistic knowledge discovery system, namely
AnyThreat, with the aim to detect any anomalous behaviour in all malicious
insider threats. We design the AnyThreat system with four components. (1) A
feature engineering component, which constructs community data sets from the
activity logs of a group of users having the same role. (2) An oversampling
component, where we propose a novel oversampling technique named Artificial
Minority Oversampling and Trapper REmoval (AMOTRE). AMOTRE first removes the
minority (anomalous) instances that have a high resemblance with normal
(majority) instances to reduce the number of false alarms, then it
synthetically oversamples the minority class by shielding the border of the
majority class. (3) A class decomposition component, which is introduced to
cluster the instances of the majority class into subclasses to weaken the
effect of the majority class without information loss. (4) A classification
component, which applies a classification method on the subclasses to achieve a
better separation between the majority class(es) and the minority class(es).
AnyThreat is evaluated on synthetic data sets generated by Carnegie Mellon
University. It detects approximately 87.5% of malicious insider threats, and
achieves the minimum of false positives=3.36%.

Exploiting this graphical structure in multiple testing procedures can improve

introduce a new general approach for large scale multiple testing, which can
aid in developing new procedures under various settings with proven control of
desired error rates. This approach is particularly useful for developing FDR
controlling procedures, which is simplified as the problem of developing
per-family error rate (PFER) controlling procedures. Specifically, for testing
hypotheses with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, by using the general
approach, under the assumption of independence, we first develop a specific
PFER controlling procedure and based on this procedure, then develop a new FDR
controlling procedure, which can preserve the desired DAG structure among the
rejected hypotheses. Through a small simulation study and a real data analysis,
we illustrate nice performance of the proposed FDR controlling procedure for

gain a better understanding of the design space for technological interventions
that might address these concerns. Our data and findings reveal complex

tensor rank decomposition if the so-called k-ranks of the product tensors are
large. In this work, we propose a conjecture in which the k-rank condition of
Kruskal's theorem is weakened to the standard notion of rank, and the
conclusion is relaxed to a statement on the linear dependence of the product
tensors. Our conjecture would imply a generalization of Kruskal's theorem.
Several adaptations and generalizations of Kruskal's theorem have already been
obtained, but these results still cannot certify uniqueness when the k-ranks
are below a certain threshold. Our generalization would contain several of
these results, and could certify uniqueness below this threshold. We prove our
conjecture over an arbitrary field $\mathbb{F}$ when the underlying
multipartite vector space takes any one of three forms:
${\mathbb{F}^{d_1}\otimes \mathbb{F}^{d_2}},
\;{\mathbb{F}^{d_1}\otimes\mathbb{F}^{d_2}\otimes \mathbb{F}^2,}$ or
$\mathbb{F}^{d_1}\otimes \mathbb{F}^2 \otimes\cdots \otimes \mathbb{F}^2$. As a
corollary to the third case, we prove that if $n$ product tensors form a
circuit, then they have rank greater than one in at most $n-2$ subsystems. This
is a quadratic improvement over a recent bound obtained by Ballico, and is
sharp.

foundation for analyzing and predicting chemical properties of molecules.
Automatic discovery of FGs will impact various fields of research, including

paper, we investigate methods based on graph convolutional neural networks
(GCNNs) for localizing FGs that contribute to specific chemical properties of
interest. In our framework, molecules are modeled as undirected relational
graphs with atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. Using this relational graph
structure, we trained GCNNs in a supervised way on experimentally-validated
molecular training sets to predict specific chemical properties, e.g.,
toxicity. Upon learning a GCNN, we analyzed its activation patterns to
automatically identify FGs using four different explainability methods that we
have developed: gradient-based saliency maps, Class Activation Mapping (CAM),
gradient-weighted CAM (Grad-CAM), and Excitation Back-Propagation. Although
these methods are originally derived for convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
we adapt them to develop the corresponding suitable versions for GCNNs. We
evaluated the contrastive power of these methods with respect to the
specificity of the identified molecular substructures and their relevance for
chemical functions. Grad-CAM had the highest contrastive power and generated
qualitatively the best FGs. This work paves the way for automatic analysis and

is presented, aiming to generate quantitative estimates of the expected
statistical uncertainty of VP analyses. We demonstrate scenarios with
considerable uncertainty in VP estimates, such that it significantly reduces
the statistical reliability of the obtained results. Especially when a
predictor variable of a dataset shows a low between-group variance, VP
estimates may show a high margin of error. This becomes particularly important
when the respective predictor variable only explains a small fraction of the
overall variance, or the number of replicates is particularly small. Moreover,
it is demonstrated that the expected error of VP estimates of a dataset can be
approximated by bootstrap resampling, giving researchers a tool for the
quantification of the uncertainty associated with an arbitrary VP analysis. The
applicability of this method is demonstrated by a re-analysis of the Oribatid
mite dataset introduced by Borcard and Legendre in 1994 and the Barro Colorado
Island tree count dataset by Condit and colleagues. We believe that this study
may encourage biologists to approach routine statistical analyses such as VP
more critically, and report the error associated with them more frequently.

representational spaces. In the context of sensory systems, encoding models
enable us to test and compare brain-computational models, and thus directly

fitted linear-model components. Sometimes the weights of the fitted linear
combinations are interpreted as reflecting, in an encoding model, the
contribution of different sensory features to the representation or, in a
decoding model, the contribution of different measured brain responses to a
decoded feature. Such interpretations can be problematic when the predictor

penalties) are used to regularize the fit. Encoding and decoding models are
evaluated in terms of their generalization performance. The correct
interpretation depends on the level of generalization a model achieves (e.g. to
new response measurements for the same stimuli, to new stimuli from the same

shown to be convenient due to the direct DL visualization by sub-bandgap

In bipartite networks, butterfly (i.e., a complete 2 x 2 biclique) is the
smallest non-trivial cohesive structure and plays a key role. In this paper, we
study the problem of efficient counting the number of butterflies in bipartite
networks. The most advanced techniques are based on enumerating wedges which is
the dominant cost of counting butterflies. Nevertheless, the existing
algorithms cannot efficiently handle large-scale bipartite networks. This
becomes a bottleneck in large-scale applications. In this paper, instead of the
existing layer-priority-based techniques, we propose a vertex-priority-based
paradigm BFC-VP to enumerate much fewer wedges; this leads to a significant
improvement of the time complexity of the state-of-the-art algorithms. In
addition, we present cache-aware strategies to further improve time efficiency
while theoretically retaining the time complexity of BFC-VP. Moreover, we also
show that our proposed techniques can work efficiently in external and parallel
contexts. Our extensive empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed
techniques can speed up the state-of-the-art techniques by up to two orders of

spin-momentum locking (SML) observed in spin-orbit materials and low-energy
barrier magnets (LBM) should exhibit a unique multi-terminal rectification for
arbitrarily small amplitude channel currents. The basic idea is to measure the
charge current induced spin accumulation in the SML channel in the form of a
magnetization dependent voltage using an LBM, either with an in-plane or
perpendicular anisotropy (IMA or PMA). The LBM feels an instantaneous
spin-orbit torque due to the accumulated spins in the channel which causes the
average magnetization to follow the current, leading to the non-linear
rectification. We discuss the frequency band of this multi-terminal
rectification which can be understood in terms of the angular momentum
conservation in the LBM. For a fixed spin-current from the SML channel, the
frequency band is same for LBMs with IMA and PMA, as long as they have the same
total magnetic moment in a given volume. The proposed all-metallic structure
could find application as highly sensitive passive rf detectors and as energy
harvesters from weak ambient sources where standard technologies may not

portions of an image and are reusable with different images -- constraints that
prove useful for generating physically-realizable attacks. Unlike most other
works on adversarial detection, SentiNet does not require training a model or
preknowledge of an attack prior to detection. Our approach is appealing due to
the large number of possible mechanisms and attack-vectors that an
attack-specific defense would have to consider. By leveraging the neural
network's susceptibility to attacks and by using techniques from model
interpretability and object detection as detection mechanisms, SentiNet turns a
weakness of a model into a strength. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
SentiNet on three different attacks -- i.e., data poisoning attacks, trojaned
networks, and adversarial patches (including physically realizable attacks) --
and show that our defense is able to achieve very competitive performance

strong adaptive adversaries, who build adversarial patches that specifically

orchestration platforms, which are designed to manage the deployment of
containerized applications in large-scale clusters. The majority of these
platforms are tailored to optimize the scheduling of containers on a
fixed-sized private cluster but are not enabled to autoscale the size of the
cluster nor to consider features specific to public cloud environments. In this

has three different objectives. The first one is to optimize the initial

The second one is to autoscale the number of resources at runtime based on the

further support the efficient use of resources by consolidating applications
into fewer VMs when possible. Our algorithms are implemented as a

  Conditioned on Natural Language Queries",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose an end-to-end capsule network for pixel level
localization of actors and actions present in a video. The localization is
performed based on a natural language query through which an actor and action
are specified. We propose to encode both the video as well as textual input in
the form of capsules, which provide more effective representation in comparison
with standard convolution based features. We introduce a novel capsule based
attention mechanism for fusion of video and text capsules for text selected
video segmentation. The attention mechanism is performed via joint EM routing
over video and text capsules for text selected actor and action localization.
The existing works on actor-action localization are mainly focused on
localization in a single frame instead of the full video. Different from
existing works, we propose to perform the localization on all frames of the
video. To validate the potential of the proposed network for actor and action
localization on all the frames of a video, we extend an existing actor-action
dataset (A2D) with annotations for all the frames. The experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed capsule network for text
selective actor and action localization in videos, and it also improves upon
the performance of the existing state-of-the art works on single frame-based
localization.

Qiu","The Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric for waveform based earthquake location","20 pages, 42 figures",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In our previous work [Chen el al., J. Comput. Phys., 373(2018)], the
quadratic Wasserstein metric is successfully applied to the earthquake location
problem. The actual earthquake hypocenter can be accurately recovered starting
from initial values very far from the true ones. However, the seismic wave
signals need to be normalized since the quadratic Wasserstein metric requires
mass conservation. This brings a critical difficulty. Since the amplitude of a
seismogram at a receiver is a good representation of the distance between the
source and the receiver, simply normalizing the signals will cause the
objective function in optimization process to be insensitive to the distance
between the source and the receiver. When the data is contaminated with strong
noise, the minimum point of the objective function will deviate and lead to a
low accurate location result.
  To overcome the difficulty mentioned above, we apply the
Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) metric [Chizat et al., Found. Comput. Math.,
18(2018)] to the earthquake location problem. The WFR metric is one of the
newly developed metric in the unbalanced Optimal Transport theory. It does not
require the normalization of the seismic signals. Thus, the amplitude of
seismograms can be considered as a new constraint, which can substantially
improve the sensitivity of the objective function to the distance between the
source and the receiver. As a result, we can expect more accurate location
results from the WFR metric based method compare to those based on quadratic
Wasserstein metric under high-intensity noise. The numerical examples also
demonstrate this.

three main properties: (1) reconfigurability: complex semantics and geometry is
captured via the synthesis of atomic visual representations (e.g., image
patch); (2) robustness: the visual semantics are registered in a geometrically
consistent way (e.g., aligning with respect to the gravity vector,
frontalizing, and rescaling to canonical depth), thus enabling us to learn
meaningful atomic representations; (3) adaptability: a domain adaptation
framework is designed to generalize the learned representation without manual

improvements when compared to existing semantic localization approaches.

electronic systems, such as memory, artificial intelligence, and neural
networks, due to its fast speed, nano-scale dimensions, and low-power
consumption. However, traditional nonanalytic models and lately reported
analytic models for memristor have the problems of nonconvergence and slow
convergence, respectively. These problems lay great obstacles in the analysis,
simulation and design of memristor. To address these problems, a modeling
methodology for analytic approximate solution of the state variable in
memristor is proposed in this work. This methodology solves the governing
equation of memristor by adopting the Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) for the
first time, and the convergence performance of the methodology is enhanced by
an optimized convergence-control parameter in the HAM. The simulation results,
compared with the reported analytic models, demonstrate that the HAM-based
modeling methodology achieves faster convergence while guaranteeing sufficient
accuracy. Based on the methodology, it can be simultaneously revealed that
highly nonlinearity is the potential sources of slow convergence in analytic
models, which is beneficial for the analysis and design guidance. In addition,
a Spice subcircuit is constructed based on the obtained HAM model, and then it
is integrated into an oscillator to verify its applicability. Due to the
generality of HAM, this methodology may be easily extended to other memory
devices.

challenging problem. Inversions are often ill-posed and the likelihood surface
may be multi-modal; properties of any single mode become inadequate uncertainty
measures, and sampling methods become inefficient for irregular posteriors or
high-dimensional parameter spaces. We explore the influences of different
choices made by the practitioner on the efficiency and accuracy of Bayesian
geophysical inversion methods that rely on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to
assess uncertainty, using a multi-sensor inversion of the three-dimensional
structure and composition of a region in the Cooper Basin of South Australia as
a case study. The inversion is performed using an updated version of the
Obsidian distributed inversion software. We find that the posterior for this
inversion has complex local covariance structure, hindering the efficiency of
adaptive sampling methods that adjust the proposal based on the chain history.
Within the context of a parallel-tempered Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme for
exploring high-dimensional multi-modal posteriors, a preconditioned
Crank-Nicholson proposal outperforms more conventional forms of random walk.
Aspects of the problem setup, such as priors on petrophysics or on 3-D
geological structure, affect the shape and separation of posterior modes,
influencing sampling performance as well as the inversion results. Use of
uninformative priors on sensor noise can improve inversion results by enabling
optimal weighting among multiple sensors even if noise levels are uncertain.
Efficiency could be further increased by using posterior gradient information
within proposals, which Obsidian does not currently support, but which could be
emulated using posterior surrogates.

The predictive capability of MD relies on the force field (FF) used to describe

and/or measured experimentally. A common practice in parameterizing FFs is to
use least-squares local minimization algorithms. Genetic algorithms (GAs) have
also been demonstrated as a viable global optimization approach, even for

efficiency of different optimization techniques for the determination of FF
parameters is still lacking. In this work, we evaluate various FF parameter
optimization schemes, using as example a training data set calculated from DFT
for different polymorphs of Ir$O_2$. The Morse functional form is chosen for
the pairwise interactions and the optimization of the parameters against the
training data is carried out using (1) multi-start local optimization
algorithms: Simplex, Levenberg-Marquardt, and POUNDERS, (2) single-objective
GA, and (3) multi-objective GA. Using random search as a baseline, we compare
the algorithms in terms of reaching the lowest error, and number of function
evaluations. We also compare the effectiveness of different approaches for FF
parameterization using a test data set with known ground truth (i.e generated
from a specific Morse FF). We find that the performance of optimization
approaches differs when using the Test data vs. the DFT data. Overall, this

challenging task, which is often achieved by training a model on some
annotation-free information. We consider spatial contexts, for which we solve
so-called jigsaw puzzles, i.e., each image is cut into grids and then
disordered, and the goal is to recover the correct configuration. Existing
approaches formulated it as a classification task by defining a fixed mapping
from a small subset of configurations to a class set, but these approaches
ignore the underlying relationship between different configurations and also
limit their application to more complex scenarios. This paper presents a novel
approach which applies to jigsaw puzzles with an arbitrary grid size and
dimensionality. We provide a fundamental and generalized principle, that weaker
cues are easier to be learned in an unsupervised manner and also transfer
better. In the context of puzzle recognition, we use an iterative manner which,
instead of solving the puzzle all at once, adjusts the order of the patches in
each step until convergence. In each step, we combine both unary and binary
features on each patch into a cost function judging the correctness of the
current configuration. Our approach, by taking similarity between puzzles into
consideration, enjoys a more reasonable way of learning visual knowledge. We
verify the effectiveness of our approach in two aspects. First, it is able to
solve arbitrarily complex puzzles, including high-dimensional puzzles, that
prior methods are difficult to handle. Second, it serves as a reliable way of
network initialization, which leads to better transfer performance in a few
visual recognition tasks including image classification, object detection, and
semantic segmentation.

invariance techniques (ESPRIT), called I-HAD-ESPRIT, is proposed to measure the
direction of arrival (DOA) of desired user, where the phase ambiguity due to
HAD structure is addressed successfully. Subsequently, a machine-learning (ML)
framework is proposed to improve the precision of measuring DOA. In the
training stage, the HAD transceiver works as a receiver and repeatedly measures
the values of DOA via I-HAD-ESPRIT to form a slightly large training data set
(TDS) of DOA. From TDS, we find that the probability density function (PDF) of
DOA measurement error (DOAME) is approximated as a Gaussian distribution by the
histogram method in ML. This TDS is used to learn the mean of DOA and the
variance of DOAME, which are utilized to infer their values and improve their
precisions in the real-time stage. The HAD transceiver rapidly measures the
real-time value of DOA some times to form a relatively small real-time set
(RTS), which is used to learn the real-time mean and variance of DOA/ DOAME.
Then, three weight combiners are proposed to combine
the-maximum-likelihood-learning outputs of TDS and RTS. Their weight factors
depend intimately on the numbers of elements in TDS and RTS, and
signal-to-noise ratios during the two stages. Using the mean and variance of
DOA/DOAME, their PDFs can be given directly, and we propose a robust beamformer
for directional modulation (DM) transmitter with HAD by fully exploiting the
PDF of DOA/DOAME, especially a robust analog beamformer on RF chain. Simulation
results show that: 1) The proposed I-HAD-ESPRIT can achieve the HAD CRLB; 2)
The proposed ML framework performs much better than the corresponding real-time
one without training stage, 3) The proposed robust DM transmitter can perform

  Uncertainty with Customer Contact Centre Applications","107 pages, 4 figures, PhD thesis 2018",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, we study the queueing systems with heterogeneous servers and
service rate uncertainty under the Halfin-Whitt heavy traffic regime. First, we
analyse many server queues with abandonments when service rates are i.i.d.
random variables. We derive a diffusion approximation using a novel method. The
diffusion has a random drift, and hence depending on the realisations of
service rates, the system can be in Quality Driven (QD), Efficiency Driven (ED)
or Quality-Efficiency-Driven (QED) regime. When the system is under QD or QED
regime, the abandonments are negligible in the fluid limit, but when it is
under ED regime, the probability of abandonment will converge to a non-zero
value. We then analyse the optimal staffing levels to balance holding costs
with staffing costs combining these three regimes. We also analyse how the
variance of service rates influence abandonment rate.
  Next, we focus on the state space collapse (SSC) phenomenon. We prove that
under some assumptions, the system process will collapse to a lower dimensional
process without losing essential information. We first formulate a general
method to prove SSC results inside pools for heavy traffic systems using the
hydrodynamic limit idea. Then we work on the SSC in multi-class queueing
networks under the Halfin-Whitt heavy traffic when service rates are i.i.d.
random variables within pools. For such systems, exact analysis provides
limited insight on the general properties. Alternatively, asymptotic analysis
by diffusion approximation proves to be effective. Further, limit theorems,
which state the diffusively scaled system process weakly converges to a
diffusion process, are usually the central part in such asymptotic analysis.
The SSC result is key to proving such a limit. We conclude by giving examples
on how SSC is applied to the analysis of systems.

the signal induced by MNPs in a receiving coil was multiplied with a reference

of the filtered signal (MPI signal). The strength of the selection magnetic
field in MPI was assumed to be given by the product of the gradient strength of
the selection magnetic field and the distance from the field-free region (x).
The relationships between the MPI signal and x were calculated for odd- and
even-numbered harmonics and were investigated for various angles between the

signal harmonics in MPI largely depended on the angle between them. This study
will be useful for improved understanding, optimization, and development of

continuous scene into a series of short-time-scale frames. All the modulated

Existing methods generally ignored the above dependency for computation

a layer-wise Recursive Bayesian Pruning method (RBP). A new dropout-based
measurement of redundancy, which facilitate the computation of posterior
assuming inter-layer dependency, is introduced. Specifically, we model the

required when the inter-layer dependency assumed. The redundant channels can be
simply identified by tiny dropout noise and directly pruned layer by layer.

GRB 130427A as a prototype we show that this ""inner engine"" acts in a sequence
of ""elementary impulses"". Electrons are accelerated to ultra-relativistic
energy near the BH horizon and, propagating along the polar axis, $\theta =0$,
they can reach energies of $\sim 10^{18}$ eV, and partially contribute to
ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). When propagating with ${\theta \neq 0}$
through the magnetic field $B_0$ they give origin by synchrotron emission to
GeV and TeV radiation. The mass of BH, $M=2.3 M_\odot$, its spin, $\alpha =
0.47$, and the value of magnetic field $B_0= 3.48 \times 10^{10}$ G, are

the first almost linear time, $O(n\cdot poly\log{n})$, deterministic SST
construction algorithm, where all previous algorithms take at least
$\Omega\left(\min\{n|B|,\frac{n^2}{|B|}\}\right)$ time. For the LCE problem, we
introduce a data structure that answers LCE queries in $O(\tau\sqrt{\log^*n})$
time, with $O(n\log\tau)$ construction time (for $\tau=O(\frac{n}{\log n})$).
This data structure improves both query time and construction time upon the
results of Tanimura et al. [CPM '16].

with low voltages (0.04 to 0.5V). These offsets are 50x smaller than the values
previously reported for GaN Hall-effect plates, and it is on par with
state-of-the-art silicon Hall-effect plates. In addition, the offset does not
exceed 10 micro-Tesla even at higher supply voltage of 2.34V. The sensor also
shows stable current-scaled sensitivity over a wide temperature range of -100C
to 200C, with temperature drift of -125 ppm/C. This value is 3x better than

common CAI minerals and thus they potentially provide constraints on very
high-T processes in the solar nebula. We report a detailed characterization of
an UR phase davisite bearing CAI from a reduced type CV chondrite. Absence of
secondary iron- and/or alkali-rich phases and occurrence of LIME olivine
indicate that primitive chemical and isotopic compositions are preserved in the
CAI. Davisite occur only in one lithological unit that consists of three
chemically and isotopically distinct parts: i) $^{16}$O-poor regions with
reversely-zoned melilite and davisite; ii) $^{16}$O-rich regions consisting of
unzoned, gehlenitic melilite, diopside and spinel; and iii) spinel framboids
composed of $^{16}$O-rich spinel and $^{16}$O-poor melilite. Random
distribution of chemical and isotopic heterogeneities with sharp boundaries in
the CAI indicates its formation by an aggregation of mineral assemblages formed
and processed separately at different time and/or space. Although isotope
exchange prior to the final agglomeration of the CAI cannot be ruled out, we
suggest that modification of chemical and isotopic composition of porous CAI
precursors or aggregation of isotopically distinct mineral assemblages are
alternative scenarios for the origin of O-isotopic heterogeneity in CAIs. In
either case, coexistence of spatially and/or temporally distinct $^{16}$O-rich
and -poor gaseous reservoirs at the earliest stage of the solar system
formation is required. The grain-scale oxygen isotopic disequilibrium in the
CAI indicate that post-formation heating of the CAI was short, which can be
achieved by rapid outward transport of the CAI. High
Ti$^{3+}$/Ti$^{\mathrm{tot}}$ ratios of pyroxene and presence of LIME olivine
document that the entire CAI formation process took place under highly reducing
conditions.

Bayesian inverse problems. For Bayesian inference, the iterative ensemble
smoother (IES) and implicit sampling are integrated to obtain importance
ensemble samples, which build an importance density. The proposed method shares
a similar idea to importance sampling. IES is used to approximate mean and
covariance of a posterior distribution. This provides the MAP point and the
inverse of Hessian matrix, which are necessary to construct the implicit map in
implicit sampling. The importance samples are generated by the implicit map and
the corresponding weights are the ratio between the importance density and
posterior density. In the proposed method, we use the ensemble samples of IES
to find the optimization solution of likelihood function and the inverse of
Hessian matrix. This approach avoids the explicit computation for Jacobian
matrix and Hessian matrix, which are very computationally expensive in high
dimension spaces. To treat non-Gaussian models, discrete cosine transform and
Gaussian mixture model are used to characterize the non-Gaussian priors. The
ensemble-based implicit sampling method is extended to the non-Gaussian priors
for exploring the posterior of unknowns in inverse problems. The proposed
method is used for each individual Gaussian model in the Gaussian mixture
model. The proposed approach substantially improves the applicability of
implicit sampling method. A few numerical examples are presented to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed method with applications of inverse problems for
subsurface flow problems and anomalous diffusion models in porous media.

continuous temporally phase shifted interferograms and phase shifts were
calculated between all the data frames using newly developed algorithm with a
high accuracy less than or equal to 5.5*10-4*pi rad. To demonstrate the
robustness of the proposed method, a manual translation of the stage was
employed to introduce continuous temporal phase shift between data frames. The

increasingly essential to efficiently moderate discussions and effectively
filter problematic content. Unfortunately, controversies occur across many
topics and domains, with great changes over time. This paper investigates
neural classifiers as a more robust methodology for controversy detection in
general web pages. Current models have often cast controversy detection on
general web pages as Wikipedia linking, or exact lexical matching tasks. The
diverse and changing nature of controversies suggest that semantic approaches
are better able to detect controversy. We train neural networks that can
capture semantic information from texts using weak signal data. By leveraging
the semantic properties of word embeddings we robustly improve on existing
controversy detection methods. To evaluate model stability over time and to
unseen topics, we asses model performance under varying training conditions to
test cross-temporal, cross-topic, cross-domain performance and annotator
congruence. In doing so, we demonstrate that weak-signal based neural
approaches are closer to human estimates of controversy and are more robust to
the inherent variability of controversies.

$P_t=3\mu^2/(8\pi Q^2)$ at which the standard swallowtail `snaps', causing the

reentrant phase transition, as the small black hole changes to a large one and
then back to small, as the pressure decreases, crossing the coexistence line of

main flow direction, a previous experiment suggested the actuator worked in two
ways: boundary layer heating and vorticity production. The heating effect was
enhanced with the parallel electrode and made the separation stronger, while
the canted electrode produced vorticity and suppressed the separation due to
the momentum transfer. Because the detailed physics is still unclear, a
numerical investigation is undertaken with a large eddy simulation and an
energy deposition model for the actuator. The flow without the actuation
corresponds to the experimental observation, indicating the calculation
successfully resolves the separation. With the actuation, as with the
experiment, the calculation successfully demonstrates definite difference
between the parallel and canted electrodes: the parallel electrode causes
excess heating and increases the separation, while the canted electrode leads
to a reduction of the separation, with a corresponding thinning of the boundary
layer due to the momentum transfer. The counter flow created by the canted
actuator plays an important role in the vortex generation, transferring
momentum to the boundary layer and, consequently, mitigating the separation.

algorithms, in order to understand what are the reasons of this phenomenon,
what is its scale, how it can be mitigated and what can be potentially done to
design better real-time traffic optimization methods.

networks have shown significant perceptual quality improvements, when they are
used in the loss function for training new networks. It is believed that these
features are better at encoding the perceptual quality and provide more
efficient representations of input images compared to other perceptual metrics
such as SSIM and PSNR. However, there have been no systematic studies to
determine the underlying reason. Due to the lack of such an analysis, it is not
possible to evaluate the performance of a particular set of features or to
improve the perceptual quality even more by carefully selecting a subset of
features from a pre-trained CNN. This work shows that the capabilities of
pre-trained deep CNN features in optimizing the perceptual quality are
correlated with their success in capturing basic human visual perception
characteristics. In particular, we focus our analysis on fundamental aspects of
human perception, such as the contrast sensitivity and orientation selectivity.
We introduce two new formulations to measure the frequency and orientation
selectivity of the features learned by convolutional layers for evaluating deep
features learned by widely-used deep CNNs such as VGG-16. We demonstrate that
the pre-trained CNN features which receive higher scores are better at
predicting human quality judgment. Furthermore, we show the possibility of
using our method to select deep features to form a new loss function, which
improves the image reconstruction quality for the well-known single-image
super-resolution problem.

the critical first order Trudinger-Moser inequalities in

$\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, whether there exists an extremal function for the
critical higher order Adams inequalities on the entire space $\mathbb{R}^n$
still remains open. The current paper represents the first attempt in this
direction. The classical blow-up procedure cannot apply to solving the
existence of critical Adams type inequality because of the absence of the
P\'{o}lya-Szeg\""{o}\ type inequality. In this paper, we develop some new ideas
and approaches based on a sharp Fourier rearrangement principle (see
\cite{Lenzmann}), sharp constants of the higher-order Gagliardo-Nirenberg
inequalities and optimal poly-harmonic truncations to study the existence and
nonexistence of the maximizers for the Adams inequalities in $\mathbb{R}^4$ of
the form $$
S(\alpha)=\sup_{\|u\|_{H^2}=1}\int_{\mathbb{R}^4}\big(\exp(32\pi^2|u|^2)-1-\alpha|u|^2\big)dx,$$
where $\alpha \in (-\infty, 32\pi^2)$. We establish the existence of the
threshold $\alpha^{\ast}$, where $\alpha^{\ast}\geq
\frac{(32\pi^{2})^2B_{2}}{2}$ and $B_2\geq \frac{1}{24\pi^2}$, such that
$S\left( \alpha\right) $ is attained if $32\pi^{2}-\alpha<\alpha^{\ast}$, and
is not attained if $32\pi^{2}-\alpha>\alpha^{\ast}$. This phenomena has not
been observed before even in the case of first order Trudinger-Moser
inequality. Therefore, we also establish the existence and non-existence of an
extremal function for the Trudinger-Moser inequality on $\mathbb{R}^2$.
Furthermore, the symmetry of the extremal functions can also be deduced through
the Fourier rearrangement principle.

expressing this design is very limited.
  To overcome its deficiencies and make explicit the rich conceptual model
which lies behind a set of annotations, we propose a domain-specific modelling
language. The proposal has been implemented as an Eclipse plug-in, including an
editor and an integrated code generator that synthesises annotation processors.
The environment also integrates a model finder, able to detect unsatisfiable
constraints between different annotations, and to provide examples of correct
annotation usages for validation. The language has been tested using a real set

found enough rich semantics expressible with Ann and omitted nowadays by the

where the X-ray emission is not very strong. By estimating the radio spectrum
integrated in this region using data from publicly available surveys, we find
that this spectrum can be reproduced by a Dark Matter model for a neutralino
with mass 43 GeV and annihilation final state $b \bar b$ for a magnetic field
of 5 $\mu$G.

based on the \textsc{FDCMSS} (Forward Decay Count--Min Space-Saving) sequential
algorithm, and efficiently exploits an averaging gossip protocol, by merging in
each interaction the involved peers' underlying data structures. We formally
prove the convergence and correctness properties of our distributed algorithm
and show that it is fast and simple to implement. Extensive experimental
results confirm that \textsc{P2PTFHH} retains the extreme accuracy and error
bound provided by \textsc{FDCMSS} whilst showing excellent scalability. Our
contributions are three-fold: (i) we prove that the averaging gossip protocol
can be used jointly with our augmented sketch data structure for mining
time--faded heavy hitters; (ii) we prove the error bounds on frequency

accelerators are increasingly developed and deployed in the major computing
systems.To make use of the CNN accelerators, CNN models are trained via the
off-line training systems such as Caffe, Pytorch and Tensorflow on multi-core
CPUs and GPUs first and then compiled to the target accelerators. Although the
two-step process seems to be natural and has been widely applied, it assumes
that the accelerators' behavior can be fully modeled on CPUs and GPUs. This
does not hold true and the behavior of the CNN accelerators is un-deterministic
when the circuit works at 'unstable' mode when it is overclocked or is affected
by the environment like fault-prone aerospace. The exact behaviors of the
accelerators are determined by both the chip fabrication and the working
environment or status. In this case, applying the conventional off-line
training result to the accelerators directly may lead to considerable accuracy
loss.
  To address this problem, we propose to train for the 'unstable' CNN
accelerator and have the 'un-determined behavior' learned together with the
data in the same framework. Basically, it starts from the off-line trained
model and then integrates the uncertain circuit behaviors into the CNN models
through additional accelerator-specific training. The fine-tuned training makes
the CNN models less sensitive to the circuit uncertainty. We apply the design
method to both an overclocked CNN accelerator and a faulty accelerator.
According to our experiments on a subset of ImageNet, the accelerator-specific
training can improve the top 5 accuracy up to 3.4% and 2.4% on average when the
CNN accelerator is at extreme overclocking. When the accelerator is exposed to
a faulty environment, the top 5 accuracy improves up to 6.8% and 4.28% on
average under the most severe fault injection.

Here, we present a robotic system capable of representing, learning, and
inferring ownership relations and norms. Ownership is represented as a graph of
probabilistic relations between objects and their owners, along with a database
of predicate-based norms that constrain the actions permissible on owned
objects. To learn these norms and relations, our system integrates (i) a novel
incremental norm learning algorithm capable of both one-shot learning and
induction from specific examples, (ii) Bayesian inference of ownership
relations in response to apparent rule violations, and (iii) percept-based
prediction of an object's likely owners. Through a series of simulated and
real-world experiments, we demonstrate the competence and flexibility of the
system in performing object manipulation tasks that require a variety of norms
to be followed, laying the groundwork for future research into the acquisition
and application of social norms.

  By considering the pressure of strange quark matter (SQM) at finite

and stability of the equation of state and showed that the equation of state of

properties of hot strange quark stars (SQS) including the gravitational mass,

redshift. Our calculations showed that in this model, the maximum mass and
radius of SQS increase by increasing temperature. Furthermore it was shown that
the average density of SQS is greater than the normal nuclear density, and it
is an increasing function of temperature. We also discussed the temperature
dependence of the maximum gravitational mass calculated from different methods.

  arXiv:811.07216",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.LG eess.SP q-bio.QM stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recordings of electrical brain activity carry information about a person's
cognitive health. For recording EEG signals, a very common setting is for a
subject to be at rest with its eyes closed. Analysis of these recordings often
involve a dimensionality reduction step in which electrodes are grouped into 10
or more regions (depending on the number of electrodes available). Then an
average over each group is taken which serves as a feature in subsequent
evaluation. Currently, the most prominent features used in clinical practice
are based on spectral power densities. In our work we consider a simplified
grouping of electrodes into two regions only. In addition to spectral features
we introduce a secondary, non-redundant view on brain activity through the lens
of Tsallis Entropy $S_{q=2}$. We further take EEG measurements not only in an
eyes closed (ec) but also in an eyes open (eo) state. For our cohort of healthy
controls (HC) and individuals suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD), the
question we are asking is the following: How well can one discriminate between
HC and PD within this simplified, binary grouping? This question is motivated
by the commercial availability of inexpensive and easy to use portable EEG
devices. If enough information is retained in this binary grouping, then such
simple devices could potentially be used as personal monitoring tools, as
standard screening tools by general practitioners or as digital biomarkers for
easy long term monitoring during neurological studies.
