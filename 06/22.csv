multi-band carrier-less amplitude and phase (NM-CAP) scheme for bandlimited
visible light communication systems in order to increase the spectral
efficiency. We show that a bandwidth saving up to 30% can be achieved thus
resulting in 44% improvement in the measured spectral efficiency with no
further bit error rate performance degradation compared to the traditional
m-CAP scheme. We also show that higher order systems can provide higher
bandwidth compression than low order systems. Furthermore, with no additional
functional blocks at the transmitter or the receiver the proposed scheme
introduces no extra computational complexity.

the result that any graph on at least two vertices must have at least two
vertices with the same degree. There are various ways in which this result can
be non-trivially generalised. For example, one can interpret this result as
saying that in any graph $G$ on at least two vertices there is a set $B$ of at
least two vertices such that the difference between the largest and the
smallest degrees (in $G$) of the vertices of $B$ is zero. In this vein we make
the following definition. For any $B\subset V(G)$, let the spread $sp(B)$ of
$B$ be defined to be the difference between the largest and the smallest of the
degrees of the vertices in $B$. For any $k\geq 0$, let $sp(G,k)$ be the largest
cardinality of a set of vertices $B$ such that $sp(B)\leq k$. Therefore the
first elementary result in graph theory says that, for any graph $G$ on at
least two vertices, $sp(G,0)\geq 2$.
  In this paper we first give a proof of a result of Erd\"" os, Chen, Rousseau
and Schelp which generalises the above to $sp(G,k)\geq k+2$ for any graph on at
least $k+2$ vertices. Our proof is short and elementary and does not use the
famous Erd\"" os-Gallai Theorem on vertex degrees. We then develop lower bounds
for $sp(G,k)$ in terms of the order of $G$ and its minimum, maximum and average
degree. We then use these results to give lower bounds on $sp(G,k)$ for trees
and maximal outerplanar graphs, most of which we show to be sharp.

various names, including well-supported compact closed categories, dgs-monoidal
categories, and dungeon categories. Perhaps the reason they keep being
reinvented is two-fold: there are many applications---including to automata,
databases, circuits, linear relations, graph rewriting, and belief
propagation---and yet the standard definition is so involved and ornate as to
be difficult to find in the literature. Indeed, a hypergraph category is,
roughly speaking, a ""symmetric monoidal category in which each object is
equipped with the structure of a special commutative Frobenius monoid,
satisfying certain coherence conditions"".
  Fortunately, this description can be simplified a great deal: a hypergraph
category is simply a ""cospan-algebra"". The goal of this paper is to remove the
scare-quotes and make the previous statement precise. We prove two main
theorems. First is a coherence theorem for hypergraph categories, which says
that every hypergraph category is equivalent to an objectwise-free hypergraph
category. Second, we prove that the category of objectwise-free hypergraph
categories is equivalent to the category of cospan-algebras.

defined by a weighted posterior expectation of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance

easily computed using any prior distribution over $(P_1,P_2)$. Moreover, WIKS
is fast to compute and can be justified under a Bayesian decision-theoretic

more powerful than competing approaches in several settings, even in
multivariate settings. We also prove that WIKS is a consistent procedure and
controls the level of significance uniformly over the null hypothesis. Finally,
we apply WIKS to a data set of scale measurements of three different groups of

  versions, more experimental aspects are discussed",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report a general macroscopic theory for the electrodynamic response of
semi-infinite metals (SIMs). The theory includes the hitherto overlooked
capacitive effects due to the finite spatial extension of a surface. The basic
structure of this theory is independent of the particulars of electron
dynamics. Analytical expressions have been obtained of the charge
density-density response function, which is naturally parsed into two parts.
One of them represents a bulk property while the other a pure surface property.
We apply the theory to study the responses according to several electronic
dynamics models and provide a unified view of their validity and limitations.
The models studied include the local dielectric model (DM), the dispersive
hydrodynamic model (HDM) and specular reflection model (SRM), as well as the
less common semi-classical model (SCM) based on Boltzmann's transport equation.
We show that, in terms of their basic equations, the SRM is an extension of the
HDM, just as the HDM is an extension of the DM. The SCM improves over the SRM
critically through the inclusion of translation symmetry breaking and surface
roughness effects. We then employ the response function to evaluate the
so-called dynamical structure factor, which plays an important role in particle
scattering. As expected, this factor reveals a peak due to the excitation of
surface plasma waves (SPWs). Surprisingly, however, the peak is shown to be
considerably sharper in the SCM than in other models, indicating an incipient
instability of the system according to this model. We also study the
distribution of charges induced by a charged particle grazing over a SIM
surface at constant speed. This distribution is shown to contain model-specific
features that are of immediate experimental interest.

guide $\beta$-electrons from the source to the detector within a magnetic flux
of 191~Tcm$^2$. A chain of ten single solenoid magnets and two larger
superconducting magnet systems have been designed, constructed, and installed
in the 70-m-long KATRIN beam line. The beam diameter for the magnetic flux
varies from 0.064~m to 9~m, depending on the magnetic flux density along the
beam line. Two transport and tritium pumping sections are assembled with
chicane beam tubes to avoid direct ""line-of-sight"" molecular beaming effect of
gaseous tritium molecules into the next beam sections. The sophisticated beam
alignment has been successfully cross-checked by electron sources. In addition,
magnet safety systems were developed to protect the complex magnet systems
against coil quenches or other system failures. The main functionality of the
magnet safety systems has been successfully tested with the two large magnet
systems. The complete chain of the magnets was operated for several weeks at
70$\%$ of the design fields for the first test measurements with radioactive

with gravitational waves (GW) at the linear level, resulting in a GW
amplification that has been well studied in the literature. Scalar

single parameter of the model (namely, the ratio between the mass of the
fluctuations of the vector field and the Hubble rate), and, for a wide range of
this parameter, it can significantly affect the phenomenology obtained from the
linear theory. This nonlinear contribution is significantly blue, improving the
comparison between the two-point function and the Cosmic Microwave Background

for the exploration of the power of near-term quantum applications. Performing
nontrivial tasks in such devices requires a fundamentally different approach
than what would be used on an error-corrected quantum computer. One such
approach is to use hybrid algorithms, where problems are reduced to a
parameterized quantum circuit that is often optimized in a classical feedback
loop. Here we describe one such hybrid algorithm for machine learning tasks by
building upon the classical algorithm known as random kitchen sinks. Our
technique, called quantum kitchen sinks, uses quantum circuits to nonlinearly
transform classical inputs into features that can then be used in a number of
machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of this
proposal by using it to solve binary classification problems for synthetic
datasets as well as handwritten digits from the MNIST database. Using the
Rigetti quantum virtual machine, we show that small quantum circuits provide
significant performance lift over standard linear classical algorithms,
reducing classification error rates from 50% to $<0.1\%$, and from $4.1\%$ to
$1.4\%$ in these two examples, respectively. Further, we are able to run the
MNIST classification problem, using full-sized MNIST images, on a Rigetti
quantum processing unit, finding a modest performance lift over the linear
baseline.

viscous boundary layers (BL) undergo a transition from a classical state to an
ultimate state. In the former state, the BL thicknesses follow a laminar-like
Prandtl-Blasius-Polhausen scaling, whereas in the latter, the BLs are turbulent
with log-corrections in the sense of Prandtl and von K\'arm\'an. Here, we
report evidence of this transition via changes in the BL structure of vertical
natural convection (VC), which is a buoyancy driven flow between differentially
heated vertical walls. The dataset spans $Ra$-values from $10^5$ to $10^9$ and
Prandtl number value of 0.709. For this $Ra$ range, the VC flow exhibits
classical state behaviour in a global sense. Yet, with increasing $Ra$, we
observe that near-wall higher-shear patches occupy increasingly larger
fractions of the wall-areas, which suggest that the BLs are undergoing a
transition from the classical state to the ultimate shear-dominated state. The
presence of streaky structures-reminiscent of the near-wall streaks in
canonical wall-bounded turbulence-further supports the notion of this
transition. Within the higher-shear patches, conditionally averaged statistics
yield a log-variation in the local mean temperature profiles, in agreement with
the log-law of the wall for mean temperature, and a $Ra^{0.37}$ effective
power-law scaling of the local Nusselt number, consistent with the
logarithmically corrected 1/2-power law scaling predicted for ultimate thermal
convection for very large $Ra$. Collectively, the results from this study
indicate that turbulent and laminar-like BL coexist in VC at moderate to high
$Ra$ and this transition from the classical state to the ultimate state
manifests as increasingly larger shear-dominated patches, consistent with the
findings reported for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and Taylor-Couette flows.

nonadditivity of coherent information at the two-letter level, a big gap

order-by-disorder process. A magnetic field applied along directions of high
symmetry also results in lifting the continuous degeneracy to a subset of
states from the original set of ground states. Metropolis Monte Carlo
simulation results are also presented on the temperature and system size

for a phase transition at T $\simeq$ 0.38 (in units of the dipole strength).

However, current implementations of miniature CLE components, such as confocal

negatively impacts the utility of in vivo imaging. In this work, we demonstrate
that software-based techniques can be used to recover lost information due to

used to reconstruct a high-resolution CLE image from a low-resolution input. In

frequencies, using detections of CO-emitting galaxies with resolved continuum
images from ngVLA. This method has completely different systematic
uncertainties to optical weak lensing shear measurements (e.g. in terms of
blending, PSF, and redshift uncertainties), and can provide additional
information to help disentangle intrinsic alignments from the cosmological
shear signal. A combined analysis of optical and CO galaxy lensing surveys
would therefore provide an extremely stringent validation of highly-sensitive
future surveys with Euclid, LSST, and WFIRST, definitively rejecting biases due
to residual systematic effects. A lensing survey on ngVLA would also provide
valuable spectral (kinematic) and polarimetric information, which can be used
to develop novel cosmological analyses that are not currently possible in the
optical.

is Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) without walls, and therefore without
boundary layers, have revealed a scaling regime that is consistent with
theoretical predictions of bulk-dominated thermal convection. In this so-called
asymptotic regime, previous studies have predicted that the Nusselt number
($Nu$) and the Reynolds number ($Re$) vary with the Rayleigh number ($Ra$)
according to $Nu\sim Ra^{1/2}$ and $Re\sim Ra^{1/2}$ at small Prandtl number
($Pr$). In this study, we consider a flow that is similar to RBC but with the
direction of temperature gradient perpendicular to gravity instead of parallel;
we refer to this configuration as vertical natural convection (VC). Since the
direction of the temperature gradient is different in VC, there is no exact
relation for the average kinetic dissipation rate, which makes it necessary to
explore alternative definitions for $Nu$, $Re$ and $Ra$ and to find physical
arguments for closure, rather than making use of the exact relation between
$Nu$ and the dissipation rates as in RBC. Once we remove the walls from VC to
obtain the homogeneous setup, we find that the aforementioned $1/2$-power-law
scaling is present, similar to the case of homogeneous RBC. When focussing on
the bulk, we find that the Nusselt and Reynolds numbers in the bulk of VC too
exhibit the $1/2$-power-law scaling. These results suggest that the
$1/2$-power-law scaling may even be found at lower Rayleigh numbers if the
appropriate quantities in the turbulent bulk flow are employed for the
definitions of $Ra$, $Re$ and $Nu$. From a stability perspective, at low- to
moderate-$Ra$, we find that the time-evolution of the Nusselt number for
homogenous vertical natural convection is unsteady, which is consistent with
the nature of the elevator modes reported in previous studies on homogeneous
RBC.

specialized processors with fixed point SIMD capabilities, like the Qualcomm

  Quantization-aware training can provide further improvements, reducing the
gap to floating point to 1% at 8-bit precision. Quantization-aware training
also allows for reducing the precision of weights to four bits with accuracy
losses ranging from 2% to 10%, with higher accuracy drop for smaller

observed in all bands, followed by a steep linear luminosity decline after +300
d. In archival images taken between 1.5 and 2.5 years before the explosion, a
weak source is visible at the supernova location, with mag$\approx$20. The
early supernova spectra show Balmer lines, with a narrow ($\sim$560 km
s$^{-1}$) P-Cygni absorption superimposed on a broad ($\sim$3400 km s$^{-1}$)
component, typical of type IIn events. Through a comparison of colour curves,
absolute light curves and spectra of SN 2013gc with a sample of supernovae IIn,
we conclude that SN 2013gc is a member of the so-called type IId subgroup. The
complex profile of the H$\alpha$ line suggests a composite circumstellar medium
geometry, with a combination of lower velocity, spherically symmetric gas and a
more rapidly expanding bilobed feature. This circumstellar medium distribution
has been likely formed through major mass-loss events, that we directly
observed from 3 years before the explosion. The modest luminosity
($M_I\sim-16.5$ near maximum) of SN 2013gc at all phases, the very small amount
of ejected $^{56}$Ni (of the order of $10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$), the major
pre-supernova stellar activity and the lack of prominent [O I] lines in
late-time spectra support a fall-back core-collapse scenario for the massive

choice of boundary conditions (of which there are three variants) and the
non-degeneracy or ""no-horizon"" condition (at least six variants). To address
the boundary conditions, we show that given a 3-dimensional region $\Omega$ of

smoothing, arbitrarily small in $C^0$ norm, such that $R \geq 0$ and the

amount. With this we are able to show that the three boundary conditions yield
equivalent Bartnik masses for two reasonable non-degeneracy conditions. We also
discuss subtleties pertaining to the various non-degeneracy conditions and
produce a nontrivial inequality between a no-horizon version of the Bartnik
mass and Bray's replacement of this with the outward-minimizing condition.

risk is treated by practitioners of cybersecurity is largely inconsistent with
definitions of cyber risk commonly offered in the literature. Contrary to
commonly cited definitions of cyber risk, concepts such as the likelihood of an
event and the extent of its impact are not used by cybersecurity practitioners.
This is also the case for use of these concepts in the current generation of
cybersecurity ontologies. Instead, terms and concepts reflective of the
adversarial nature of cyber defense appear to take the most prominent roles.
This research offers the first quantitative empirical evidence that rejection
of traditional concepts of cyber risk by cybersecurity professionals is indeed
observed in real-world practice.

Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project. Lags are
measured using the \texttt{JAVELIN} software from the first-year SDSS-RM $g$
and $i$ photometry, resulting in well-defined lags for 95 quasars, 33 of which
have lag SNR $>$ 2$\sigma$. We also estimate lags using the \texttt{ICCF}
software and find consistent results, though with larger uncertainties.
Accretion-disk structure is fit using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach,
parameterizing the measured continuum lags as a function of disk size
normalization, wavelength, black hole mass, and luminosity. In contrast with
previous observations, our best-fit disk sizes and color profiles are
consistent (within 1.5~$\sigma$) with the \citet{SS73} analytic solution. We
also find that more massive quasars have larger accretion disks, similarly
consistent with the analytic accretion-disk model. The data are inconclusive on
a correlation between disk size and continuum luminosity, with results that are
consistent with both no correlation and with the \citet{SS73} expectation. The
continuum lag fits have a large excess dispersion, indicating that our measured
lag errors are underestimated and/or our best-fit model may be missing the
effects of orientation, spin, and/or radiative efficiency. We demonstrate that
fitting disk parameters using only the highest-SNR lag measurements biases
best-fit disk sizes to be larger than the disk sizes recovered using a Bayesian
approach on the full sample of well-defined lags.

work aims at obtaining intergranular normal stress distributions in uncracked
polycrystalline aggregates, which is considered as a key milestone towards
IGSCC initiation predictive modelling. Based on the finite element method,
numerical simulations have been performed on Voronoi polycrystalline aggregates
considering a wide variety of material constitutive equations: crystal
elasticity (cubic and hexagonal symmetries) with different anisotropy ratios
and crystal plasticity for different sets of slip systems under the assumption
of uniform critical resolved shear stress: Face-Centered Cubic (FCC),
Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) and Hexagonal Close Packed (HCP) with or without
hardening, and for both uniaxial and equibiaxial macroscopic loading
conditions. In the elastic regime, a correlation between standard deviations of
intergranular normal stress distributions and a universal elastic anisotropy
index proposed recently is found and explained through a simple model. For
macroscopic strain larger than the yield strain, the evolution of standard
deviations with strain is rationalized by accounting only for the macroscopic
elastic strain and the standard deviation of Taylor factor. These numerical
results associated with physically-based simple models allow to estimate easily
intergranular normal stress concentrations, constituting a tool for classifying
polycrystalline aggregates according to their potential susceptibility to
IGSCC.

that the discrepancy of the dwarf galaxies IMF with respect to the Milky Way

emerge, including polar distortions and interfacial intermixing which reduce
the sharpness of the interface. Here, we examine how atomic intermixing at

charge distribution away from the oxide/oxide interface; thereby changing the
direction of polar distortions away from this boundary with minimal effect on

equivalent to the transient phase transition tipping point observed in double

main-sequence (MS) and white dwarf (WD) stars. We find that the integrated TDE

galactic nucleus and that $\sim 90$% of the TDEs reside in GCs within a maximum
radius of $\sim 2-15$ kpc from the host galaxy's center. This suggests that
observational efforts designed to identify TDEs should not confine themselves
to galactic nuclei alone, but should also consider the outer galactic halo
where massive old GCs hosting IMBHs would reside. Indeed, such off-centre TDEs
as predicted here may already have been observed. MS TDE rates are more common
than WD TDE rates by a factor 30 (100) at $z\leq 0.5$ ($z=2$). We also
calculate the rate of IMBH-SBH mergers across cosmic time, finding that the
typical IMRI rate at low redshift is of the order of $\sim 0.5-3$ Gpc$^{-3}$

by high variability in the price of all crypto-currencies. In this work, we
study the abrupt transition in crypto-currency residuals, which is associated
with the critical transition (the phenomenon of critical slowing down) or the
stochastic transition phenomena. We find that, regardless of the specific
crypto-currency or rolling window size, the autocorrelation always fluctuates
around a high value, while the standard deviation increases monotonically.
Therefore, while the autocorrelation does not display signals of critical
slowing down, the standard deviation can be used to anticipate critical or
stochastic transitions. In particular, we have detected two sudden jumps in the
standard deviation, in the second quarter of 2017 and at the beginning of 2018,
which could have served as early warning signals of two majors price collapses
that have happened in the following periods. We finally propose a mean-field
phenomenological model for the price of crypto-currency to show how the use of
the standard deviation of the residuals is a better leading indicator of the
collapse in price than the time series' autocorrelation. Our findings represent
a first step towards a better diagnostic of the risk of critical transition in
the price and/or volume of crypto-currencies.

is an important mechanism for efficiently coupling the accreting black hole to
the surrounding environment. Recent observations confirm that X-ray selected
AGN samples respect the effective Eddington limit for dusty gas in the plane
defined by the observed column density versus the Eddington ratio, the
so-called $N_{\rm H} - \lambda$ plane. A `forbidden' region occurs in this
plane, where obscuring clouds cannot be long-lived, due to the action of
radiation pressure on dust. Here we compute the effective Eddington limit by
explicitly taking into account the trapping of reprocessed radiation (which has
been neglected in previous works), and investigate its impact on the $N_{\rm H}
- \lambda$ plane. We show that the inclusion of radiation trapping leads to an
enhanced forbidden region, such that even Compton-thick material can
potentially be disrupted by sub-Eddington luminosities. We compare our model
results to the most complete sample of local AGNs with measured X-ray
properties, and find good agreement. Considering the anisotropic emission from
the accretion disc, we also expect the development of dusty outflows along the
polar axis, which may naturally account for the polar dust emission recently
detected in several AGNs from mid-infrared observations. Radiative feedback
thus appears to be the key mechanism regulating the obscuration properties of
AGNs, and we discuss its physical implications in the context of co-evolution
scenarios.

robots are robotic systems embedding elastic elements into a classic rigid
(skeleton\--like) structure. Leveraging on their bodies elasticity, soft robots
promise to push their limits far beyond the barriers that affect their rigid
counterparts. However, existing control strategies aiming at achieving this
goal are either tailored on specific examples, or rely on model cancellations -
thus defeating the purpose of introducing elasticity in the first place.
  In a series of recent works, we proposed to implement efficient oscillatory
motions in robots subject to a potential field, aimed at solving these issues.
A main component of this theory are Eigenmanifolds, that we defined as
nonlinear continuations of the classic linear eigenspaces. When the soft robot
is initialized on one of these manifolds, it evolves autonomously while
presenting regular - and thus practically useful - evolutions, called normal
modes. In addition to that, we proposed a control strategy making modal
manifolds attractors for the system, and acting on the total energy of the soft
robot to move from a modal evolution to the other. In this way, a large class
of autonomous behaviors can be excited, which are direct expression of the
embodied intelligence of the soft robot.
  Despite the fact that the idea behind our work comes from physical intuition
and preliminary experimental validations, the formulation that we have provided
so far is however rather theoretical, and very much in need of an experimental
validation. The aim of this paper is to provide such an experimental validation
using as testbed the articulated soft leg. We will introduce a simplified
control strategy, and we will test its effectiveness on this system, to
implement swing-like oscillations. We plan to extend this validation with a
soft quadruped.

local universe falls about 30-40% short of the total number of baryons
predicted by Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis, as inferred from density fluctuations of
the Cosmic Microwave Background and seen during the first 2-3 billion years of
the universe in the so called Lyman-alpha Forest. A theoretical solution to
this paradox locates the missing baryons in the hot and tenuous filamentary gas
between galaxies, known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium. However, it is
difficult to detect them there because the largest by far constituent of this
gas - hydrogen - is mostly ionized and therefore almost invisible in
far-ultraviolet spectra with typical signal-to-noise ratios. Indeed, despite
the large observational efforts, only a few marginal claims of detection have
been made so far. Here we report observations of two absorbers of highly
ionized oxygen (OVII) in the high signal-to-noise-ratio X-ray spectrum of a
quasar at redshift >0.4. These absorbers show no variability over a 2-year
timescale and have no associated cold absorption, making the assumption that
they originate from the quasar's intrinsic outflow or the host galaxy's
interstellar medium implausible. The OVII systems lie in regions characterized
by large (x4 compared to average) galaxy over-densities and their number (down
to the sensitivity threshold of our data), agrees well with numerical
simulation predictions for the long-sought warm-hot intergalactic medium
(WHIM). We conclude that the missing baryons have been found.

Fires from smoldering combustion can last for long periods of time, emit more
pollutants, and be difficult to extinguish. This makes the study of smoldering
in woody fuels and forest duff important. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin
are the major constituents in these type of fuels, in different proportions for
different fuels. In this paper, we developed a 1-D model using the open-source
software Gpyro to study the smoldering combustion of cellulose and
hemicellulose mixtures. We first validated our simulations against
experimentally obtained values of propagation speed for mixtures with fuel
compositions including 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% cellulose, with the remaining
proportion of hemicellulose. Then, we studied the effects of varying fuel
composition, density, and moisture content on smoldering combustion. We find
that propagation speed of smoldering increased with decreases in density and
increases in hemicellulose content, which we attribute to the role of oxygen
diffusion. Propagation speed increased with moisture content for pure cellulose
up to a certain limiting value, after which the propagation speed dropped by up
to 70%. The mean peak temperature of smoldering increased with increases in
hemicellulose content and density, and decreased with increasing moisture
content.

effect of correlated dephasing in single-photon transmission experiments with

the single-photon transmittance despite the presence of noise and dissipation.
In addition, we demonstrate that these spectroscopic measurements contain the
same information as standard time-resolved Ramsey interferometry, and thus they
can be used to fully characterize the noise correlations without direct access
to the emitter. The method is exemplified with paradigmatic correlated
dephasing models such as colored Gaussian noise, white noise, telegraph noise,

years to improve performance and ensure availability in distributed, replicated
systems, ensuring correctness of transactional applications running on top of
such systems remains a difficult and important problem. Serializability is a
well-understood correctness criterion for transactional programs; understanding
whether applications are serializable when executed in a weakly-consistent
environment, however remains a challenging exercise. In this work, we combine
the dependency graph-based characterization of serializability and the
framework of abstract executions to develop a fully automated approach for
statically finding bounded serializability violations under \emph{any} weak
consistency model. We reduce the problem of serializability to satisfiability
of a formula in First-Order Logic, which allows us to harness the power of
existing SMT solvers. We provide rules to automatically construct the FOL
encoding from programs written in SQL (allowing loops and conditionals) and the
consistency specification written as a formula in FOL. In addition to detecting
bounded serializability violations, we also provide two orthogonal schemes to
reason about unbounded executions by providing sufficient conditions (in the
form of FOL formulae) whose satisfiability would imply the absence of anomalies
in any arbitrary execution. We have applied the proposed technique on TPC-C, a
real world database program with complex application logic, and were able to
discover anomalies under Parallel Snapshot Isolation, and verify
serializability for unbounded executions under Snapshot Isolation, two
consistency mechanisms substantially weaker than serializability.

  Modern Webservices and Implications",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent October 2016 DDoS attack on Dyn served as a wakeup call to the
security community as many popular and independent webservices (e.g., Twitter,
Spotify) were impacted. This incident raises a larger question on the fragility
of modern webservices due to their dependence on third-party services. In this
paper, we characterize the dependencies of popular webservices on third party
services and how these can lead to DoS, RoQ attacks, and reduction in security
posture. In particular, we focus on three critical infrastructure services:
DNS, CDNs, and certificate authorities (CAs). We analyze both direct
relationships (e.g., Twitter uses Dyn) and indirect dependencies (e.g., Netflix
uses Symantec as OCSP and Symantec, in turn, uses Verisign for DNS). Our key
findings are: (1) 73.14% of the top 100,000 popular services are vulnerable to
reduction in availabil- ity due to potential attacks on third-party DNS, CDN,
CA services that they exclusively rely on; (2) the use of third-party services
is concentrated, so that if the top-10 providers of CDN, DNS and OCSP services
go down, they can potentially impact 25%-46% of the top 100K most popular web
services; (3) transitive depen- dencies significantly increase the set of
webservices that exclusively depend on popular CDN and DNS service providers,
in some cases by ten times (4) targeting even less popular webservices can
potentially cause signifi- cant collateral damage, affecting upto 20% of the
top- 100K webservices due to their shared dependencies. Based on our findings,
we present a number of key implications and guidelines to guard against such
Internet- scale incidents in the future.

practical fluid dynamic applications where the sensing is typically sparse.
Fluid flows in an ideal sense are manifestations of nonlinear multiscale PDE
dynamical systems with inherent scale separation that impact the system
dimensionality. There is a common need to analyze the data from flow
measurements or high-fidelity computations for stability characteristics,
identification of coherent structures and develop evolutionary models for
real-time data-driven control. Given that sparse reconstruction is inherently
an ill-posed problem, the most successful approaches require the knowledge of
the underlying basis space spanning the manifold in which the system resides.
In this study, we employ an approach that learns basis from singular value
decomposition (SVD) of training data to reconstruct sparsely sensed information
at randomly sampled locations. This allows us to leverage energy sparsity with
l2 minimization instead of the more expensive, sparsity promoting l1
minimization. Further, for unknown flow systems where only global operating
parameters such as Reynolds (Re) number and raw data are available, it is often
not clear what the optimal number of sensors and their placement for near-exact
reconstruction needs to be. In this effort, we explore the interplay of data
sparsity, sparsity of the underlying flow system and sensor placement on energy
sparse reconstruction performance enabled by data- driven SVD basis. To this
end, we investigate sparse convolution-based reconstruction performance by
characterizing operational bounds for canonical laminar cylinder wake flows in
both limit-cycle and transient regimes.

determined (up to equivalence) by the characteristic polynomials of Frobenius
elements Fr$_v$ at any set of primes $v$ of $K$ of degree $1$ over $F$. Here we
prove an analogue for GL$(n)$, namely that a cuspidal automorphic
representation $\pi$ of GL$(n, {\mathbb A}_K)$ is determined up by the
knowledge of its local components at the primes of degree one over $F$. We
prove in fact a stronger theorem, stimulated by a question of Michael Rapoport
and Wei Zhang, relaxing to an extent the Galois hypothesis. The method uses,
besides the Rankin-Selberg theory of L-functions and the Luo-Rudnick-Sarnak
bound for the Hecke roots of $\pi$, certain consequences of class field theory
via Galois cohomology. In an earlier paper (\cite{Ra2}) we obtained such a
result up to twist equivalence for $K/F$ cyclic of prime degree by using basic
Kummer theory. We make use of suitable solvable base changes $\pi_M$, relative
to certain auxiliary succession of abelian extensions $E/F$, with $M$ being an
abelian extension of the compositum $EK$, and deduce that $\pi_M \simeq
\pi'_M$, and then descend this isomorphism to one over $K$. A key ingredient
for progress here is the use of global Tate duality and a local-global result
arising from class field theory. In fact we prove the main result for {\it
isobaric} automorphic representations, which are analogues of {\it semisimple}
Galois representations. In the last section we introduce a notion of {\it
semi-temperedness}, which is much weaker than temperedness, but allows for the
deduction of the main result without any hypothesis whatsoever on $K/F$.

to the low-luminosity Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2017ejb. SN 2017ejb was
discovered in NGC 4696, a well-studied elliptical galaxy in the Centaurus
cluster with 894 ks of Chandra imaging between 14 and 3 years before SN 2017ejb
was discovered. Using post-explosion photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2017ejb,
we demonstrate that SN 2017ejb is most consistent with low-luminosity SNe Ia
such as SN 1986G and SN 1991bg. Analyzing the location of SN 2017ejb in
pre-explosion images, we do not detect a pre-explosion X-ray source. We use
these data to place upper limits on the presence of any unobscured supersoft
X-ray source (SSS). SSS systems are known to consist of white dwarfs accreting
from a non-degenerate companion star. We rule out any source similar to known
SSS systems with $kT_{\rm eff} > 85$ eV and $L_{\rm bol} >
4\times10^{38}~\text{erg s}^{-1}$ as well as models of stably-accreting
Chandrasekhar-mass WDs with accretion rates
$\dot{M}>3\times10^{-8}~M_{\odot}~\text{yr}^{-1}$. These findings suggest that
low-luminosity SNe Ia similar to SN 2017ejb explode from WDs that are low-mass,
have low pre-explosion accretion rates, or accrete very soon before explosion.
Based on the limits from SN 2017ejb and other nearby SNe Ia, we infer that
$<$47% of SNe Ia explode in stably-accreting Chandrasekhar-mass SSS systems.

incorporating prior knowledge about the structure of target objects has proven
effective in traditional energy-based segmentation approaches, there has not

this work, we propose a new loss term that encodes the star shape prior into
the loss function of an end-to-end trainable fully convolutional network (FCN)

guarantee a global structure in segmentation results. Our experiments
demonstrate the advantage of regularizing FCN parameters by the star shape

we perform the similar analysis in a singular higher derivative gauge theory

$\tau$-estimation has been successfully used for p-adaptation algorithms. This
method estimates the truncation error of representations with different
polynomial orders using the solution on a reference mesh of relatively high
order.
  In this paper, we present a novel anisotropic truncation error estimator
derived from the $\tau$-estimation procedure for DGSEM. We exploit the tensor
product basis properties of the numerical solution to design a method where the
total truncation error is calculated as a sum of its directional components. We
show that the new error estimator is cheaper to evaluate than previous
implementations of the $\tau$-estimation procedure and that it obtains more
accurate extrapolations of the truncation error for representations of a higher
order than the reference mesh. The robustness of the method allows performing
the p-adaptation strategy with coarser reference solutions, thus further
reducing the computational cost. The proposed estimator is validated using the
method of manufactured solutions in a test case for the compressible
Navier-Stokes equations.

two primary and two secondary. As primary criteria, we propose that the new
asset should provide sufficient incremental diversification to the reference

sufficiently predictable. As secondary criteria, we propose that the new asset
should mitigate tail risk, and the new asset should be suitable for passive
investment (e.g. buy-and-hold or short-and-hold). We discuss how to quantify
incremental diversification, returns predictability, impact on tail risk, and

since the gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking effects and the relevant
Yukawa couplings are relatively small. A ""focus point"" of the singlet's soft
mass parameter can emerge around the stop mass scale, and so various
fine-tuning measures can reduce well below 100. Due to the relatively large

experimental bounds, and the unwanted flavor changing processes are adequately
suppressed.

OGLE-2017-BLG-0537. The light curve of the event exhibits two strong
caustic-crossing spikes among which the second caustic crossing was resolved by
high-cadence surveys. It is found that the lens components with a mass ratio
$\sim 0.5$ are separated in projection by $\sim 1.3\thetae$, where $\thetae$ is
the angular Einstein radius. Analysis of the caustic-crossing part yields
$\thetae=1.77\pm 0.16$~mas and a lens-source relative proper motion of $\mu
=12.4\pm 1.1~{\rm mas}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The measured $\mu$ is the third highest
value among the events with measured proper motions and $\sim 3$ times higher
than the value of typical Galactic bulge events, making the event a strong
candidate for follow-up observations to directly image the lens by separating
it from the source. From the angular Einstein radius combined with the
microlens parallax, it is estimated that the lens is composed of two
main-sequence stars with masses $M_1\sim 0.4~M_\odot$ and $M_2\sim 0.2~M_\odot$
located at a distance of $D_{\rm L}\sim 1.2$~kpc. However, the physical lens
parameters are not very secure due to the weak microlens-parallax signal, and
thus we cross check the parameters by conducting a Bayesian analysis based on
the measured Einstein radius and event timescale combined with the blending
constraint. From this, we find that the physical parameters estimated from the
Bayesian analysis are consistent with those based on the measured microlens
parallax. Resolving the lens from the source can be done in about 5 years from
high-resolution follow-up observations and this will provide a rare opportunity
to test and refine the microlensing model.

simulation and packet-level experiments on a testbed, we demonstrate that
compared to existing methods Spotlight distributes the traffic more efficiently
and has near-optimum performance in terms of overall service utilization.
Moreover, Spotlight is not sensitive to utilization polling interval and
therefore can be implemented with low polling frequency to reduce the amount of
control traffic. Indeed, Spotlight achieves the mentioned performance
improvements using O(100ms) polling interval.

this article, we proposed a model-based clustering method that transforms the
challenging high-dimension-small-sample-size problem to

grouping SNPs into three clusters. We pre-specify the patterns of clusters by
minor allele frequencies of SNPs between cases and controls, and enforce the
patterns with prior distributions. In the simulation studies our proposed novel
model outperform traditional SNP-wise approach by showing better controls of
false discovery rate (FDR) and higher sensitivity. We re-analyzed two real
studies to identifying SNPs associated with severe bortezomib-induced
peripheral neuropathy (BiPN) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). The
original analysis in the literature failed to identify SNPs after FDR

  In this paper, we sought to understand which observable socio-technical
attributes of developers can be used to build good models of them being future
@-mentioned in GitHub issues and pull request discussions. We built overall and
project-specific predictive models of future @-mentions, in order to capture
the determinants of @-mentions in each of two hundred GitHub projects, and to

detailed fashion for the presence of cancer. As such, there has been
significant recent interest in computer aided diagnosis systems for analysing

the photon detection is still an issue to be clarified. We develop a
mathematical formulation for the photon propagation using the formalism of
electromagnetic field quantization and the path-integral method, whose main
feature is its similarity with a fractional Fourier transform (FrFT). Here we
show that, because of the close relation existing between the FrFT and the
Fresnel diffraction integral, this propagator can be written as a Fresnel
diffraction, which brings forward a discussion of the fundamental character of
it at the photon level compared to the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Finally, we
carry out an experiment of photon counting by a rectangular slit supporting the
result that the diffraction phenomenon in the Fresnel approximation behaves as

ignore the corresponding classes in the training process. However, the
application of hard labels may lose some information about the tendency of
class distributions. Instead, we propose a Centroid distance-based Soft coding
scheme to indicate such tendency, named as CSECOC. In our algorithm, Sequential
Forward Floating Selection (SFFS) is applied to search an optimal class
assignment by minimizing the ratio of intra-group and inter-group distance. In
this way, a hard coding matrix is generated initially. Then we propose a
measure, named as coverage, to describe the probability of a sample in a class
falling to a correct group. The coverage of a class a group replace the
corresponding hard element, so as to form a soft coding matrix. Compared with
the hard ones, such soft elements can reflect the tendency of a class belonging
to positive or negative group. Instead of classifiers, regressors are used as
base learners in this algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first
time that soft coding scheme has been proposed. The results on five UCI

significantly enhanced for the LHC Run- 2 in order to cope with the higher
event rates and with the large number of simultaneous interactions (pile-up)
per protonproton bunch crossing. A new hardware system, designed to analyse
real time event-topologies at Level-1 came to full use in 2017. A
hardware-based track reconstruction system, expected to be used real-time in
2018, is designed to provide track information to the high-level software
trigger at its full input rate. The high-level trigger selections are largely
relying on offline-like reconstruction techniques, and in some cases
multivariate analysis methods. Despite the sudden change in LHC operations
during the second half of 2017, which caused an increase in pile-up and
therefore also in CPU usage of the trigger algorithms, the set of triggers (so
called trigger menu) running online has undergone only minor modifications
thanks to the robustness and redundancy of the trigger system, and the use of a
levelling luminosity scheme in agreement with LHC and other experiments. This
presentation gives a brief yet comprehensive review of the real-time
performance of the ATLAS trigger system in 2017. Considerations will be
presented on the most relevant parameters of the trigger (efficiency to collect
signal and output data rate) as well as details on some aspects of the
algorithms which are run real-time on the High Level Trigger CPU farm.

  more complete historical overview of the ideas in the paper",,,,"cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The state complexity of the result of a regular operation is often positively
correlated with the number of distinct transformations induced by letters in
the minimal deterministic finite automaton of the input languages. That is,
more transformations in the inputs means higher state complexity in the output.
When this correlation holds, the state complexity of a unary operation can be
maximized using languages in which there is one letter corresponding to each
possible transformation; for operations of higher arity, we can use $m$-tuples
of languages in which there is one letter corresponding to each possible
$m$-tuple of transformations. In this way, a small set of languages can be used
as witnesses for many common regular operations, eliminating the need to search
for witnesses -- though at the expense of using very large alphabets. We
formalize this approach and examine its limitations. We define a class of
""uniform"" operations for which this approach works; the class is closed under
composition and includes common operations such as star, concatenation,
reversal, union, and complement. Our main result is that the worst-case state
complexity of a uniform operation can be determined by considering a finite set
of witnesses, and this set depends only on the arity of the operation and the
state complexities of the inputs.

into Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) with a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL)

providing input in the form of full demonstrations along with some subgoal
states. These subgoal states define a set of subtasks for the learning agent to
complete in order to achieve the final goal. The learning agent queries for
partial demonstrations corresponding to each subtask as needed when the agent
struggles with the subtask. The proposed Human Interactive IRL (HI-IRL)

that subgoal-based interactive structuring of the learning task results in
significantly more efficient learning, requiring only a fraction of the

equatorial plane of a rotating black hole and using the relativistic equation

Further, we study the non-linearities such as shock waves in accretion flow.
Here also we find that the shock properties are in agreement for both
relativistic and semi-relativistic flows irrespective of the black hole spin
($a_k$), although it deviates significantly for non-relativistic flow. In fact,
when the particular shocked solutions are compared for flows with identical
outer boundary conditions, the positions of shock transition in relativistic

addition, we compare the parameter space for shock to establish the fact that
relativistic as well as semi-relativistic accretion flow dynamics do show close
agreement irrespective of $a_k$ values, whereas non-relativistic flow fails to
do so. With these findings, we point out that semi-relativistic flow including

from 2D orthographic views. A novel CNN-based regression network, with two
branches corresponding to frontal and lateral views respectively, is designed
for estimating 3D human body shape from 2D mask images. We train our networks
separately to decouple the feature descriptors which encode the body parameters
from different views, and fuse them to estimate an accurate human body shape.
In addition, to overcome the shortage of training data required for this
purpose, we propose some significantly data augmentation schemes for 3D human
body shapes, which can be used to promote further research on this topic.
Extensive experimen- tal results demonstrate that visually realistic and
accurate reconstructions can be achieved effectively using our algorithm.
Requiring only binary mask images, our method can help users create their own

graph $\mathscr T_\infty=(V_\infty, E_\infty)$ by adding a vertex $\infty$ to
$V$ and declaring each vertex in $V$ as a parent of $\infty.$ One may associate
with the extended directed tree a family of semigroup structures $\sqcup_{b}$
with extreme ends being induced by the join operation $\sqcup$ and the meet
operation $\sqcap$. Each semigroup structure among these leads to a family of
densely defined linear operators $W^{b}_{\lambda_u}$ acting on $\ell^2(V),$
which we refer to as weighted join operators at a given base point $b \in
V_{\infty}$ with prescribed vertex $u \in V$. The extreme ends of this family
are weighted join operators $W^{\mathsf{root}}_{\lambda_u}$ and weighted meet
operators $W^{\infty}_{\lambda_u}$. In this paper, we systematically study
these operators. We also present a more involved counter-part of weighted join
operators on rootless directed trees. In both cases, the class of weighted join
operators overlaps with the well-studied classes of complex Jordan operators
and $n$-symmetric operators. An important half of this paper is devoted to the
study of rank one extensions $W_{f, g}$ of weighted join operators, where $f
\in \ell^2(V)$ and $g : V \to \mathbb C$ is unspecified. Unlike weighted join
operators, these operators are not necessarily closed. We provide a couple of
compatibility conditions involving the weight system $\lambda_u$ and $g$ to
ensure closedness of $W_{f, g}$. We discuss the role of the Gelfand-triplet in
the realization of the Hilbert space adjoint of $W_{f, g}$. Further, we
describe various spectral parts of $W_{f, g}$ in terms of the weight system and
the tree data. We also provide sufficient conditions for $W_{f, g}$ to be a
sectorial operator. In case $\mathscr T$ is leafless, we characterize rank one
extensions $W_{f, g}$, which admit compact resolvent.

invoking a strong wind from the disc to flatten its radial temperature profile,
which can then reconcile the size discrepancy problem. This wind model has been
successfully applied to several microlensed quasars with a wind strength
$s\lesssim1.3$ by only considering the inward decreasing of the mass accretion
rate (where $s$ is defined through $\dot{M}(R)\propto({R}/{R_{0}})^{s}$ ).
After further incorporating the angular momentum transferred by the wind, our
model can resolve the disc size problem with an even lower wind parameter. The
corrected disc sizes under the wind model are correlated with black hole masses
with a slope in agreement with our modified thin disc model.

reduction in fine-tuning together with lowering $\Lambda$. In particular,
perfectly natural [$\Delta \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)$] theories with a multi-TeV

lowering of the fine-tuning for large cut-off scales can also be observed in
theories exhibiting special quasi-fixed point behaviours of parameters. Our
observations call for a more throughout exploration of possible alternative

ambient conditions, especially those with practical applications, has attracted
enormous research interest. Recent discovery of Weyl semimetal provides an
ideal material platform for such endeavors. The Berry curvature in a Weyl
semimetal becomes singular at the Weyl node, creating an effective magnetic
monopole in the k-space. A pair of Weyl nodes carry quantized effective
magnetic charges with opposite signs, and therefore, opposite chirality.
Although Weyl-point-related signatures such as chiral anomaly and non-closing
surface Fermi arcs have been detected through transport and ARPES measurements,
direct experimental evidence of the effective k-space monopole of the Weyl
nodes has so far been lacking. In this work, signatures of the singular
topology in a type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 is revealed in the photo
responses, which are shown to be directly related to the divergence of Berry
curvature. As a result of the divergence of Berry curvature at the Weyl nodes,
TaIrTe4 exhibits unusually large photo responsivity of 130.2 mA/W with 4-{\mu}m
excitation in an unbiased field effect transistor at room temperature arising
from the third-order nonlinear optical response. The room temperature mid-IR
responsivity is approaching the performance of commercial HgCdTe detector
operating at low temperature, making Type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 of
practical importance in terms of photo sensing and solar energy harvesting.
Furthermore, the high shift photocurrent response at the Weyl cones is found to
enhance the circularly polarized galvanic response from Weyl cones with
opposite chirality, which opens new experimental possibilities for studying and
controlling the chiral polarization of Weyl Fermions through an in-plane DC
electric field in addition to the optical helicities.

  https://github.com/VirtualCodecNetwork",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose an image re-sampling compression method by learning
virtual codec network (VCN) to resolve the non-differentiable problem of
quantization function for image compression. Here, the image re-sampling not
only refers to image full-resolution re-sampling but also low-resolution
re-sampling. We generalize this method for standard-compliant image compression
(SCIC) framework and deep neural networks based compression (DNNC) framework.
Specifically, an input image is measured by re-sampling network (RSN) network
to get re-sampled vectors. Then, these vectors are directly quantized in the
feature space in SCIC, or discrete cosine transform coefficients of these
vectors are quantized to further improve coding efficiency in DNNC. At the
encoder, the quantized vectors or coefficients are losslessly compressed by
arithmetic coding. At the receiver, the decoded vectors are utilized to restore
input image by image decoder network (IDN). In order to train RSN network and
IDN network together in an end-to-end fashion, our VCN network intimates
projection from the re-sampled vectors to the IDN-decoded image. As a result,
gradients from IDN network to RSN network can be approximated by VCN network's
gradient. Because dimension reduction can be further achieved by quantization
in some dimensional space after image re-sampling within auto-encoder
architecture, we can well initialize our networks from pre-trained auto-encoder
networks. Through extensive experiments and analysis, it is verified that the
proposed method has more effectiveness and versatility than many
state-of-the-art approaches.

than previously used, our new images have allowed us to confirm the presence of

revolutions of the spiral pattern of WR104 in the K-band for the first time.
The circumstellar dust extends up to 2 arcsec from the central binary star in
the N-band, corresponding to the past 20 years of mass loss. Moreover, we found
no clear evidence of a shadow of the first spiral coil onto the subsequent

a Self-organized Gradient Percolation (SGP) algorithm to reduce the
computational cost and overcome these numerical drawbacks. The (SGP) method is
based on gradient percolation theory, relevant to calculation of local
saturation. The initialization of this algorithm is driven by an analytic
solution of the homogenous diffusion equation, which is a convolution between a
Probability Density Function (PDF) and a smoothing function. Thus, we propose
to reproduce the evolution of the capillary pressure profiles by the evolution
of the standard deviation of the PDF. This algorithm is validated by comparing
the results with the capillary pressure profiles and the mass gain curve
obtained by finite element simulations and experimental measurements,
respectively. The computational time of the proposed algorithm is lower than
that of finite element models for one-dimension case. In conclusion, the SGP
method permits to reduce the computational cost and does not produce spurious

anomalies, several of which support a possible deviation from statistical
isotropy, has motivated a search for models that provide a common mechanism to
generate them. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether these anomalies
could originate from non-Gaussian cosmological models, and to determine what
properties these models should have. We present a simple isotropic,
non-Gaussian class of toy models that can reproduce six of the most extensively
studied anomalies. We compare the presence of anomalies found in simulated maps
generated from the toy models and from a standard model with Gaussian
fluctuations. We show that the following anomalies, as found in the Planck

asymmetry (large-scale dipolar modulation), (2) small-scale hemispherical
asymmetry (alignment of the spatial distribution of CMB power over all scales

classical parabolic equations theory. Up to an additional approximating
argument, this allows us to show that the super-hedging price solves the
parabolic equation and that a perfect hedging strategy can be constructed when
the coefficients are smooth enough. This representation leads to a general dual
formulation. We finally provide an asymptotic expansion around a model without
impact.

cooperative paramagnetic regime. For this purpose, we consider the
$J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ classical Heisenberg model on kagome and pyrochlore lattices
with $J_2 = J_3=J$. In the absence of farther-neighbor couplings, $J=0$, the
system is in the Coulomb phase with magnetic correlations well characterized by
pinch-point singularities. Farther-neighbor couplings lead to the formation of
magnetic clusters, which can be interpreted as a counterpart of
topological-charge clusters in Ising frustrated magnets [T. Mizoguchi, L. D. C.
Jaubert and M. Udagawa, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 119}, 077207 (2017)]. The
concomitant static and dynamical magnetic structure factors, respectively
$\mathcal{S}({\bm{q}})$ and $\mathcal{S}({\bm{q}},\omega)$, develop half-moon
patterns. As $J$ increases, the continuous nature of the Heisenberg spins
enables the half-moons to coalesce into connected `star' structures spreading
across multiple Brillouin zones. These characteristic patterns are a dispersive
complement of the pinch point singularities, and signal the proximity to a
Coulomb phase. Shadows of the pinch points remain visible at finite energy,
$\omega$. This opens the way to observe these clusters through (in)elastic
neutron scattering experiments. The origin of these features are clarified by
complementary methods: large-$N$ calculations, semi-classical dynamics of the
Landau-Lifshitz equation, and Monte Carlo simulations. As promising candidates
to observe the clustering states, we revisit the origin of ""spin molecules""

distributed averaging algorithm which operates exclusively with quantized
values (specifically, the information stored, processed and exchanged between

on event-driven updates (e.g., to reduce energy consumption, communication
bandwidth, network congestion, and/or processor usage). We characterize the
properties of the proposed distributed averaging protocol on quantized values
and show that its execution, on any time-invariant and strongly connected
digraph, will allow all agents to reach, in finite time, a common consensus

distributed across different servers and the observations across servers,

violating the identically distributed assumption. Our strategy fixes the
super-efficiency phenomenon observed in prior work on distributed computing in
the isotonic regression framework, where averaging several isotonic estimates
(each computed at a local server) on a central server produces super-efficient
estimates that do not replicate the properties of the global isotonic
estimator, i.e. the isotonic estimate that would be constructed by transferring
all the data to a single server. The new estimator proposed in this paper works
by smoothing the data on each local server, communicating the smoothed
summaries to the central server, and then computing an isotonic estimate at the
central server, and is shown to replicate the asymptotic properties of the
global estimator, and also overcome the super-efficiency phenomenon exhibited
by earlier estimators. For data on $N$ observations, the new estimator can be
constructed by transferring data just over order $N^{1/3}$ across servers [as
compared to transferring data of order $N$ to compute the global isotonic
estimator], and requires the same order of computing time as the global
estimator.

(VRPSD) under optimal restocking. We develop an exact algorithm that is
effective for solving instances with many vehicles and few customers per route.
In our experiments, we show that in these instances solving the stochastic
problem is most relevant (i.e., the potential gains over the deterministic
equivalent solution are highest). The proposed branch-price-and-cut algorithm
relies on an efficient labeling procedure, exact and heuristic dominance rules,
and completion bounds to price profitable columns. Instances with up to 76
nodes could be solved in less than 5 hours, and instances with up to 148 nodes
could be solved in long-runs of the algorithm. The experiments also allowed new
findings on the problem. Solving the stochastic problem leads to solutions up
to 10% superior to the deterministic equivalent solution. When the number of
routes is not fixed, the optimal solutions under detour-to-depot and optimal
restocking are nearly equivalent. Opening new routes is a good strategy to
reduce restocking costs, and in many cases results in solutions with less
transportation costs. For the first time, scenarios where the expected demand
in a route is allowed to exceed the capacity of the vehicle were also tested,
and the results indicate that superior solutions with lower cost and fewer

group adheres to the electrical model of Hodgkin and Huxley, while the other
describes the action potential as a non-linear acoustic pulse propagating
within an interface near a transition. However, despite remarkable
similarities, acoustics remains a non-intuitive mechanism for action potentials
for the following reason. While acoustic pulses are typically associated with
the propagation of density, pressure and temperature variation, action
potentials are most commonly measured electrically. Here, we show that this
discrepancy is lifted upon considering the electrical and chemical aspects of
the interface, in addition to its mechanical properties. Specifically, we
demonstrate how electrical and pH aspects of acoustic pulses emerge from an
idealized description of the lipid interface, which is based on classical
physical principles and contains no fit parameters. The pulses that emerge from
the model show striking similarities to action potentials not only in
qualitative shape and scales (time, velocity and voltage), but also demonstrate
saturation of amplitude and annihilation upon collision.

topic in obstetric care. While the performance of the current state-of-the-art
NIPT solutions achieve high sensitivity and specificity, they still struggle
with a considerable number of samples that cannot be concluded with certainty.
Such uninformative results are often subject to repeated blood sampling and
re-analysis, usually after two weeks, and this period may cause a stress to the
future mothers as well as increase the overall cost of the test. We propose a
supplementary method to traditional z-scores to reduce the number of such
uninformative calls. The method is based on a novel analysis of the length
profile of circulating cell free DNA which compares the change in such profiles
when random-based and length-based elimination of some fragments is performed.
The proposed method is not as accurate as the standard z-score; however, our
results suggest that combination of these two independent methods correctly
resolves a substantial portion of healthy samples with an uninformative result.
Additionally, we discuss how the proposed method can be used to identify
maternal aberrations, thus reducing the risk of false positive and false
negative calls.

online interactive game where each question-response pair corresponds to a fact
of the target entity, to acquire highly accurate knowledge effectively with
nearly zero labor cost. Knowledge acquisition via 20 Questions predominantly
presents two challenges to the intelligent agent playing games with human
players. The first one is to seek enough information and identify the target
entity with as few questions as possible, while the second one is to leverage
the remaining questioning opportunities to acquire valuable knowledge
effectively, both of which count on good questioning strategies. To address
these challenges, we propose the Learning-to-Ask (LA) framework, within which
the agent learns smart questioning strategies for information seeking and
knowledge acquisition by means of deep reinforcement learning and generalized
matrix factorization respectively. In addition, a Bayesian approach to
represent knowledge is adopted to ensure robustness to noisy user responses.
Simulating experiments on real data show that LA is able to equip the agent
with effective questioning strategies, which result in high winning rates and
rapid knowledge acquisition. Moreover, the questioning strategies for
information seeking and knowledge acquisition boost the performance of each
other, allowing the agent to start with a relatively small knowledge set and
quickly improve its knowledge base in the absence of constant human
supervision.

transfer over a variety of rough walls in a channel. The wall geometries are
exactly resolved in the simulations. The aim is to understand the effect of
roughness morphology and its scaling on the augmentation of heat transfer
relative to that of skin friction. A number of realistic rough surface maps
obtained from the scanning of gas turbine blades and internal combustion
engines as well as several artificially generated rough surfaces are examined.
In the first part of the paper, effects of statistical surface properties,
namely surface slope and roughness density, at constant roughness height are
systematically investigated, and it is shown that Reynolds analogy factor (two
times Stanton number divided by skin friction coefficient) varies meaningfully
but moderately with the surface parameters except for the case with extremely
low slope or density where the Reynolds analogy factor grows significantly and
tends to that of a smooth wall. In the second part of the paper, the roughness
height is varied (independently in both inner and outer units) while the
geometrical similarity is maintained. Considering all the simulated cases, it
is concluded that Reynolds analogy factor correlates fairly well with the
equivalent sand roughness scaled in inner units and asymptotically tends to a
plateau.

acoustic signals on sources by wave propagation from the position of sensors.
TR and BP have different treatments for received signals, but they are
equivalent under continuously sampling on a closed circular sensor array in two
dimensions. Here, we analyze image quality with discrete under-sampled sensors
in the sense of the Shannon sampling theorem. We investigate resolution and
contrast of TR and BP, respectively in one source-sensor pair configuration and
the frequency domain. With Hankel's asymptotic expansion to the integrands of
imaging functions, our main contribution is to demonstrate that TR and BP have
better performance on contrast and resolution, respectively. We also show that
the integrand of TR includes additional side lobes which degrade axial
resolution whereas that of BP conversely has relatively small amplitudes.
Moreover, omnidirectional resolution is improved if more sensors are employed
to collect the received signals. Nevertheless, for the under-sampled sensors,
we propose the Truncated Back-Projection (TBP) method to enhance the contrast
of BP using removing higher frequency components in the received signals. We
conduct numerical experiments on the two-dimensional projected phantom model
extracted from OA-Breast Database. The experiments verify our theories and show
that the proposed TBP possesses better omnidirectional resolution as well as
contrast compared with TR and BP with under-sampled sensors.

Analysis of the PPP data-cubes (i.e. 3D density fields) also reveals elongated
coherent features, which we term sub-filaments. Unfortunately there is very
poor correspondence between the fibres and the sub-filaments in the
simulations. Both fibres and sub-filaments derive from inhomogeneities in the
turbulent accretion flow onto the main filament. As a consequence, fibres are
often affected by line-of-sight confusion. Similarly, sub-filaments are often
affected by large velocity gradients, and even velocity discontinuities. These
results suggest that extreme care should be taken when using velocity coherent
features to constrain the underlying substructure within a filament.

paradigm. It has been also reported that unconstrained astrophysical processes
may address the issues. In response to this situation, we revisit the decaying
dark matter solution to the issues, discussing possible signatures to
discriminate decaying dark matter from astrophysical processes as a solution to
small-scale issues. We consider an axinolike particle (ALPino) decaying into an
axionlike particle (ALP) and gravitino with the lifetime around the age of the
Universe. The ALPino mass is sub-PeV and slightly ($\Delta m/m\sim 10^{-4}$)
larger than the gravitino mass, and thus the dark matter abundance does not
alter virtually after the ALPino decays. On the other hand, the gravitino
produced from the ALPino decay obtains a kick velocity of $\sim 30 \,{\rm km /
s}$, which is sufficiently larger than a circular velocity of dwarf galaxies to
impact their dark matter distributions. The Lyman-$\alpha$ forest constraints
are relieved since only a small fraction ($\sim10$%) of dark matter experiences
the decay at that time. Decaying dark matter is thus promoted to a viable
solution to small-scale issues. The ALPino relic abundance is determined
predominantly by the decay of the lightest ordinary supersymmetric particle.
The monochromatic ALP emission from the ALPino decay is converted to $\sim 50
\,{\rm GeV}$ photon under the Galactic magnetic field. The morphology of the
gamma-ray flux shows a distinctive feature of the model when compared to
decaying dark matter that directly decays into photons. Once detected, such
distinctive signals discriminate the decaying dark matter solution to
small-scale issues from unconstrained astrophysical processes.

repulsion stemming from the Lee-Huang-Yang correction to the mean-field energy.
Self-trapped vortex tori, carrying the topological charges m1=m2=1 or m1=m2=2
in their components, are constructed by means of numerical and approximate
analytical methods. The analysis reveals stability regions for the vortex
droplets (in broad and relatively narrow parameter regions for m1=m2=1 and

self-trapped states with the double vorticity, in any physical setting. The
stable modes are shaped as flat-top ones, with the space between the inner
hole, induced by the vorticity, and the outer boundary filled by a nearly
constant density. On the other hand, all modes with hidden vorticity, i.e.,
topological charges of the two components m1=-m2=1, are unstable. The stability
of the droplets with m1=m2=1 against splitting (which is the main scenario of
possible instability) is explained by estimating analytically the energy of the
split and un-split states. The predicted results may be implemented, exploiting
dilute quantum droplets in mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates.

correlations between various parameters and implies the underlying simplicity.
In the optical plane defined by the width of the H\{beta} line and the ratio of
the equivalent width of the Fe II to H\{beta} observed objects form a
characteristic pattern. In this paper, we use a physically motivated model to
explain the distribution of quasars in the optical plane. Continuum is modelled
as an accretion disk with a hard X-ray power law uniquely tight to the disk at
the basis of observational scaling, and the Broad Line Region distance is
determined also from observational scaling. We perform the computations of the
FeII and H\{beta} line production with the code CLOUDY. We have only six free
parameters for an individual source: maximum temperature of the accretion disk,
Eddington ratio, cloud density, cloud column density, microturbulence, and iron
abundance, and only the last four remain as global parameters in our modelling
of the whole sequence. Our theoretically computed points cover well the optical
plane part populated with the observed quasars, particularly if we allow for
super-Solar abundance of heavy elements. Explanation of the exceptionally
strong Fe II emitter requires a stronger contribution from the dark sides of
the clouds. Analyzing the way how our model covers the optical plane we
conclude that there is no single simple driver behind the sequence, as neither
the Eddington ratio nor broad band spectrum shape plays the dominant role.
Also, the role of the viewing angle in providing the dispersion of the quasar
main sequence is apparently not as strong as expected.

model. The hybrid of Type I and Type II seesaw mechanisms leads to the nonzero
value of the reactor angle $\theta_{13}\neq 0$ and to the recently disfavored
maximal atmospheric angle $\theta_{23} \neq45^{\circ}$ by the NOvA experiment.
The phenomenological consequences of the model are studied for both normal and
inverted mass hierarchies. The obtained ranges for the effective Majorana
neutrino mass $m_{\beta \beta}$, the electron neutrino mass $m_{\nu_{e}}$, and
the $CP$ violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ lie within the current experimental
allowed ranges where we find that the normal mass hierarchy is favored over the
inverted one.

technology in recent years. Walking pattern generation is a fundamental topic
in the design of these robots. The usual approach with most exoskeletons is to
use a pre-recorded pattern as a look-up table. There are some deficiencies with
this method, including data storage limitation and poor regulation relating to
the walking parameters. Therefore modeling human walking patterns to use in
exoskeletons is required. The few existing models provide piece by piece
walking patterns, only generating at the beginning of each stride cycle in
respect to fixed walking parameters. In this paper, we present a real-time
walking pattern generation method which enables changing the walking parameters
during the stride. For this purpose, two feedback controlled third order
systems are proposed as optimal trajectory planners for generating the
trajectory of the x and y components of each joints position. The boundary
conditions of the trajectories are obtained according to some pre-considered
walking constraints. In addition, a cost function is intended for each
trajectory planner in order to increase the trajectories smoothness. We use the
minimum principle of Pontryagin to design the feedback controller in order to
track the boundary conditions in such a way that the cost functions are
minimized. Finally, by using inverse kinematics equations, the proper joints
angles are generated for and implemented on Exoped robot. The good performance
of the gait planner is demonstrated by second derivative continuity of the
trajectories being maintained as a result of a simulation, and user
satisfaction being determined by experimental testing.

nucleus (AGN) accretion disc sizes are generally larger than the predictions of
the classical thin disc by a factor of $2\sim 3$. This hints at some missing
key ingredient in the classical thin disc theory: here, we propose an accretion
disc wind. For a given bolometric luminosity, in the outer part of an accretion
disc, the effective temperature in the wind case is higher than that in the
no-wind one; meanwhile, the radial temperature profile of the wind case is
shallower than the no-wind one. In presence of winds, for a given band,
blackbody emission from large radii can contribute more to the observed
luminosity than the no-wind case. Therefore, the disc sizes of the wind case
can be larger than those of the no-wind case. We demonstrate that a model with
the accretion rate scaling as $\dot{M}_0 (R/R_{\mathrm{S}})^{\beta}$ (i.e., the
accretion rate declines with decreasing radius due to winds) can match both the
inter-band time lags and the spectral energy distribution of NGC 5548. Our
model can also explain the inter-band time lags of other sources. Therefore,
our model can help decipher current and future continuum reverberation mapping

test key technologies for future space-borne gravitational-wave observatories
like LISA. The main scientific goal of LPF was to demonstrate measurements of
differential acceleration between free-falling test masses at the sub-femto-g
level, and to understand the residual acceleration in terms of a physical model
of stray forces, and displacement readout noise. A key step toward reaching the
LPF goals was the correct calibration of the dynamics of LPF, which was a
three-body system composed by two test-masses enclosed in a single spacecraft,
and subject to control laws for system stability. In this work, we report on
the calibration procedures adopted to calculate the residual differential stray
force per unit mass acting on the two test-masses in their nominal positions.
The physical parameters of the adopted dynamical model are presented, together
with their role on LPF performance. The analysis and results of these
experiments show that the dynamics of the system was accurately modeled and the
dynamical parameters were stationary throughout the mission. Finally, the
impact and importance of calibrating system dynamics for future space-based
gravitational wave observatories is discussed.

assuming rotation in the movement. These models are defined with equidistant
distant time steps. However, telemetry data from marine animals are observed
irregularly. To account for irregular data, a time-irregularised
first-difference correlated random walk model with drift is introduced. The
model generalizes the commonly used first-difference correlated random walk
with regular time steps by allowing irregular time steps, including a drift
term, and by allowing different autocorrelation in the two coordinates. The
model is applied to data from a ringed seal collected through the Argos
satellite system, and is compared to related movement models through
simulations. Accounting for irregular data in the movement model results in
accurate parameter estimates and reconstruction of movement paths. Measured by
distance, the introduced model can provide more accurate movement paths than
the regular time counterpart. Extracting accurate movement paths from uncertain
telemetry data is important for evaluating space use patterns for marine
animals, which in turn is crucial for management. Further, handling irregular
data directly in the movement model allows efficient simultaneous analysis of
several animals.

invariant random subgroup of a group into an invariant random subgroup of a
larger group.
  We use this operation to construct new continuum size families of non-atomic,
weakly mixing invariant random subgroups of certain classes of wreath products,
HNN-extensions and free products with amalgamation. By use of small
cancellation theory, we also construct a new continuum size family of
non-atomic invariant random subgroups of $\mathbb{F}_2$ which are all invariant

  Moreover, for amenable groups $\Gamma\leq \Delta$, we obtain that the
standard co-induction operation from the space of weak equivalence classes of
$\Gamma$ to the space of weak equivalence classes of $\Delta$ is continuous if
and only if $[\Delta :\Gamma]<\infty$ or $\text{core}_\Delta(\Gamma)$ is
trivial. For general groups we obtain that the co-induction operation is not

tighter bounds and more accurate uncertainty estimates than variational
autoencoders (VAE) trained with a standard single-sample objective. However,
IWAEs scale poorly: as the latent dimensionality grows, they require
exponentially many samples to retain the benefits of importance weighting.
While sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) can address this problem, it is
prohibitively slow because the resampling step imposes sequential structure
which cannot be parallelised, and moreover, resampling is non-differentiable
which is problematic when learning approximate posteriors. To address these
issues, we developed tensor Monte-Carlo (TMC) which gives exponentially many
importance samples by separately drawing $K$ samples for each of the $n$ latent
variables, then averaging over all $K^n$ possible combinations. While the sum
over exponentially many terms might seem to be intractable, in many cases it
can be computed efficiently as a series of tensor inner-products. We show that
TMC is superior to IWAE on a generative model with multiple stochastic layers
trained on the MNIST handwritten digit database, and we show that TMC can be
combined with standard variance reduction techniques.

~92%. Even more striking, the efficiency between online and offline recorded
luminosity, obtained by comparing the data quality output, is close to 99%,
which highlights how well the detector, its data acquisition system and its
control system have been performing despite much harsher and more variable
conditions than initially foreseen. In this paper, the excellent performance of
the LHCb experiment will be described, by transversally tying together the
timing and data acquisition system, the software trigger, the real-time

1.2 ($2\nu$) in three dimensions, when duplex helicity is removed. The relation
$\alpha = 2\nu$ in rotationless hairpin folding is further verified in two

knowledge, is the first observation of the theoretical lower bound on $\alpha$,

redshift as function of the angular-distance rather than the usually considered
inverse relation. Already at linear level in metric perturbations, we find a
significant difference. Indeed, even if both relations are led by source radial
velocity for close enough sources, this effect is suppressed by 2 orders of
magnitude in the redshift/angular-distance relation. This fact can
significantly reduce the theoretical uncertainty for close sources already
investigated in the literature for the angular-distance/redshift relation and
open a new scenario for clarifying the tension in the measurement of $H_0$ from
local sources rather than from the CMB.

require a new framework for proper characterization. Based on our definition of
foliated fracton phases in which equivalence between models includes the
possibility of adding layers of gapped 2D states, we propose to characterize
fractional excitations in these phases up to the addition of quasiparticles
with 2D mobility. That is, two quasiparticles differing by a set of
quasiparticles that move along 2D planes are considered to be equivalent;
likewise, 'braiding' statistics are measured in a way that is insensitive to
the attachment of 2D quasiparticles. The fractional excitation types and
statistics defined in this way provide a universal characterization of the
underlying foliated fracton order which can subsequently be used to establish
phase relations. We demonstrate as an example the equivalence between the

the current space velocities of the HVSs need to be determined. With the advent
of Gaia's second data release, accurate radial velocities from spectroscopy are
complemented by proper motion measurements of unprecedented quality. Based on a
new spectroscopic analysis method, we provide revised distances and stellar
ages, both of which are crucial to unravel the nature of the HVSs. We
reanalyzed low-resolution optical spectra of 14 HVSs from the MMT HVS survey
using a new grid of synthetic spectra, which account for deviations from local
thermodynamic equilibrium, to derive effective temperatures, surface gravities,
radial velocities, and projected rotational velocities. Stellar masses, radii,
and ages were then determined by comparison with stellar evolutionary models
that account for rotation. Finally, these results were combined with
photometric measurements to obtain spectroscopic distances. The resulting
atmospheric parameters are consistent with those of main sequence stars with
masses in the range 2.5 - 5.0 $M_\odot$. The majority of the stars rotate at
fast speeds, providing further evidence for their main sequence nature. Stellar
ages range from 90 to 400 Myr and distances (with typical
$1\sigma$-uncertainties of about 10-15%) from 30 to 100 kpc. Except for one

wirelessly using wide-band transmission. This brings great challenges. To avoid
collecting a large amount of data from the massive number of nodes, computation
over multi-access channel (CoMAC) is proposed to compute a desired function
over the air utilizing the signal-superposition property of MAC. Due to
frequency selective fading, wide-band CoMAC is more challenging and has never
been studied before. In this work, we propose the use of orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) in wide-band CoMAC to transmit functions in a
similar way to bit sequences through division, allocation and reconstruction of
function. An achievable rate without any adaptive resource allocation is
derived. To prevent a vanishing computation rate from the increase of the
number of nodes, a novel sub-function allocation of sub-carriers is derived.
Furthermore, we formulate an optimization problem considering power allocation.
A sponge-squeezing algorithm adapted from the classical water-filling algorithm
is proposed to solve the optimal power allocation problem. The improved
computation rate of the proposed framework and the corresponding allocation has
been verified through both theoretical analysis and simulation.

connectivity in vivo with MRI. In this study, we present a probabilistic atlas
of the thalamic nuclei built using ex vivo brain MRI scans and histological
data, as well as the application of the atlas to in vivo MRI segmentation. The
atlas was built using manual delineation of 26 thalamic nuclei on the serial
histology of 12 whole thalami from six autopsy samples, combined with manual
segmentations of the whole thalamus and surrounding structures (caudate,
putamen, hippocampus, etc.) made on in vivo brain MR data from 39 subjects. The
3D structure of the histological data and corresponding manual segmentations
was recovered using the ex vivo MRI as reference frame, and stacks of blockface
photographs acquired during the sectioning as intermediate target. The atlas,
which was encoded as an adaptive tetrahedral mesh, shows a good agreement with
with previous histological studies of the thalamus in terms of volumes of
representative nuclei. When applied to segmentation of in vivo scans using
Bayesian inference, the atlas shows excellent test-retest reliability,
robustness to changes in input MRI contrast, and ability to detect differential
thalamic effects in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The probabilistic atlas
and companion segmentation tool are publicly available as part of the

cast the gap equation in an alternative form which explicitly highlights these
two-particle correlations, by showing that it is equivalent to a
Hugenholtz-Pines condition for fermion pairs. At a formal level, a direct
connection is established in this way between the treatment of the condensate

the use of this alternative form of the gap equation is expected to make easier
the inclusion of pairing fluctuations beyond mean field. As a proof-of-concept
of the new method, we apply the modified form of the gap equation to the

continuously tune the electrical resistance by orders of magnitude without

short-range order. While well-ordered specimen are metallic, increasing amounts
of disorder can eventually lead to an insulating state with vanishing
conductivity in the 0K limit, but a similar number of charge carriers. These
observations make disordered GST one of the most promising candidates for the
realization of a true Anderson insulator. While so far the low-temperature
properties have mostly been studied in films of small grain size, here a
sputter-deposition process is employed that enables preparation of a large
variety of these GST states including metallic and truly insulating ones. By
growing films of GST on mica substrates, biaxially textured samples with huge
grain sizes are obtained. A series of these samples is employed for transport
measurements, as their electron mean free path can be altered by a factor of
20. Yet, the mean free path always remains more than an order of magnitude
smaller than the lateral grain size. This proves unequivocally that grain
boundaries play a negligible role for electron scattering, while intragrain
scattering, presumably by disordered vacancies, dominates. Most importantly,
these findings underline that the Anderson insulating state as well as the
system's evolution towards metallic conductivity are indeed intrinsic
properties of the material.

Tokamak during DD and DT experiments poses serious challenges to the
performance of the diagnostic control and data acquisition system (CDAcq). The
ongoing design of the ITER Radial Neutron Camera (RNC) diagnostic is composed
by 26 lines of sight (LOS) for complete plasma inspection. The CDAcq system
aims at meeting the ITER requirements of delivering the measurement of the
real-time neutron emissivity profile with time resolution and control cycle
time of 10 ms at peak event rate of 2 MEvents/s per LOS. This measurement
demands the generation of the neutron spectra for each LOS with neutron/gamma
discrimination and pile up rejection. The neutron spectra can be totally
processed in the host CPU or it can use the processed data coming from the
system FPGA. The number of neutron counts extracted from the spectra is then
used to calculate the neutron emissivity profile using an inversion algorithm.
Moreover, it is required that the event based raw data acquired is made
available to the ITER data network without local data storage for post
processing. The data production for the 2 MEvents/s rate can go up to a maximum
data throughput of 0.5 GB/s per channel. The evaluation of the use of real-time
data compression techniques in RNC is also depicted in another contribution.
  To meet the demands of the project a CDAcq prototype has been used to design
and test a high-performance distributed software architecture taking advantage
of multi-core CPU technology capable of coping with the requirements. This
submission depicts the design of the real-time architecture, the spectra
algorithms (pulse height analysis, neutron/gamma discrimination and pile-up

Deep neural networks, by contrast, can automatically extract person specific

the drawback of large numbers of parameters, requiring large training data sets

benchmarked against an SVM and compared to other contemporary architectures

when the two spheres approach each other the flow generated by the inert sphere

a self-assembled dimer motor that is able to propel itself in solution. The
fluid flow field at the moment of dimer formation changes direction. The ratio

structure formation. Provided that selection effects are under control, large
X-ray surveys are well suited to derive cosmological parameters, in particular
those governing the dark energy equation of state. We forecast the capabilities
of the all-sky eROSITA (the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope
Array) survey to be achieved by the early 2020s. We bring special attention to
modeling the entire chain from photon emission to source detection and
cataloguing. The selection function of galaxy clusters for the upcoming eROSITA
mission is investigated by means of extensive and dedicated Monte-Carlo
simulations. Employing a combination of accurate instrument characterization
and of state-of-the-art source detection technique, we determine a cluster
detection efficiency based on the cluster fluxes and sizes. Using this eROSITA
cluster selection function, we find that eROSITA will detect a total of $\sim
10^5$ clusters in the extra-galactic sky. This number of clusters will allow
eROSITA to put stringent constraints on cosmological models. We show that
incomplete assumptions on selection effects, such as neglecting the
distribution of cluster sizes, induce a bias in the derived value of
cosmological parameters. Synthetic simulations of the eROSITA sky capture the
essential characteristics impacting the next-generation galaxy cluster surveys
and they highlight parameters requiring tight monitoring in order to avoid
biases in cosmological analyses.

explore a typical case showing Phenomenon I, quasar SDSS J153715.74+582933.9

within its Si IV BAL and two additional NAL systems within its C IV BAL, and
confirm their coordinated weakening. Combining with the obvious strengthening
of the ionizing continuum, we attribute the BAL variability in J1537+5829 to
the ionization changes caused by the continuum variations. Secondly, a
statistical study based on multiobserved quasars from SDSS-I/II/III is
presented. We confirm that (1) the moderate anticorrelation between the
fractional variations of Si IV BALs and the continuum in 74 quasars that show
Phenomenon I and (2) the sample showing BAL variations tends to have larger
ionizing continuum variations. These results reveal the ubiquitous effect of
the continuum variability on Phenomenon I and BAL variation. We attribute the
relative lack of variation of C IV BALs in Phenomenon I to the saturation
effects. Nonetheless, these absorbers are not very optically thick in Si IV and
the ionization changes in response to continuum variations could be the main
driver of their variations. Finally, we find that the saturation effect on BAL

Here we combine reciprocal and real space information to map the full complex
order parameter based on topographic scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
images. Our technique overcomes limitations of earlier Fourier space based
techniques to achieve distinct amplitude and phase images with high spatial
resolution. Applying this analysis to transition metal dichalcogenides provides
striking evidence that their CDWs consist of three individual charge
modulations whose ordering vectors are connected by the fundamental rotational
symmetry of the crystalline lattice. Spatial variations in the relative phases
of these three modulations account for the different contrasts often observed
in STM topographic images. Phase images further reveal topological defects and
discommensurations, a singularity predicted by theory for a nearly commensurate
CDW. Such precise real space mapping of the complex order parameter provides a
powerful tool for a deeper understanding of the CDW ground state whose

experimentally verified fact that there are three independent modes of
distortion, each with its associated elastic constant. On the other hand, the
arguably more first-principles order parameter-based Landau-de Gennes theory
only involves two independent elastic modes. The resulting 'elastic constants
problem' has led to a considerable amount of vexation among theorists. In a
series of papers at the turn of the century, Fukuda and Yokoyama suggested that
the resolution of this problem could be found in the proper treatment of
non-local effects in the ideal part of the free energy. They used an ingenious,
but technically complex, technique based on a field-theoretic approach to
semi-flexible polymers. Here we revisit their idea but now in the more
accessible framework of density functional theory of rigid particles. Our work
recovers their main results for rod-like particles, in that generically an
ordered assembly of non-interacting rods has three independent elastic
constants associated to it that all scale as the square of the length of the
particles and obey the inequalities $K_2 < K_1 < K_3$. We also consider the
case of disc-like particles, and then find in line with expectations that $K_3

systems when the interest is the analysis of their behaviour as time
progresses. This modelling formalism is mostly used for checking whether the
behaviours of a system satisfy a set of properties of interest. Even if
efficient model-checkers for Timed Automata exist, these tools are not easily
configurable. First, they are not designed to easily allow adding new Timed
Automata constructs, such as new synchronization mechanisms or communication
procedures, but they assume a fixed set of Timed Automata constructs. Second,
they usually do not support the full Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) and
rely on a precise semantics for the logic in which the property of interest is
specified which cannot be easily modified and customized. Finally, they do not
easily allow using different solvers that may speed up verification in
different contexts. This paper presents a novel technique to perform model
checking of full Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) properties on TA. The
technique relies on the translation of both the TA and the MITL formula into an
intermediate Constraint LTL over clocks (CLTLoc) formula which is verified
through an available decision procedure. The technique is flexible since the
intermediate logic allows the encoding of new semantics as well as new TA
constructs, by just adding new CLTLoc formulae. Furthermore, our technique is
not bound to a specific solver as the intermediate CLTLoc formula can be
verified using different procedures.

linguistic and paralinguistic functions to prosodic forms has been a
longstanding challenge of speech communication research. Traditional intonation
models have given way to the overwhelming performance of deep learning (DL)
techniques for training general purpose end-to-end mappings using millions of
tunable parameters. The shift towards black box machine learning models has
nonetheless posed the reverse problem -- a compelling need to discover
knowledge, to explain, visualise and interpret. Our work bridges between a
comprehensive generative model of intonation and state-of-the-art DL
techniques. We build upon the modelling paradigm of the Superposition of
Functional Contours (SFC) model and propose a Variational Prosody Model (VPM)
that uses a network of variational contour generators to capture the
context-sensitive variation of the constituent elementary prosodic contours. We
show that the VPM can give insight into the intrinsic variability of these
prosodic prototypes through learning a meaningful prosodic latent space
representation structure. We also show that the VPM is able to capture prosodic
phenomena that have multiple dimensions of context based variability. Since it
is based on the principle of superposition, the VPM does not necessitate the
use of specially crafted corpora for the analysis, opening up the possibilities
of using big data for prosody analysis. In a speech synthesis scenario, the
model can be used to generate a dynamic and natural prosody contour that is
devoid of averaging effects.

suffer from two known problems: First, they have strictly ""absolute pitch

commonly perceived in terms of relative distances between pitches (e.g.,
melodies, scale types, modes, cadences, or chord types). Second, they fall
short of capturing the concepts of repetition and musical form. In this paper
we introduce the recurrent gated autoencoder (RGAE), a recurrent neural network
which learns and operates on interval representations of musical sequences. The
relative pitch modeling increases generalization and reduces sparsity in the
input data. Furthermore, it can learn sequences of copy-and-shift operations
(i.e. chromatically transposed copies of musical fragments)---a promising
capability for learning musical repetition structure. We show that the RGAE
improves the state of the art for general connectionist sequence models in
learning to predict monophonic melodies, and that ensembles of relative and
absolute music processing models improve the results appreciably. Furthermore,
we show that the relative pitch processing of the RGAE naturally facilitates
the learning and the generation of sequences of copy-and-shift operations,

(HI) in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) from the much larger astrophysical
foregrounds is to restrict the analysis to a wedge-shaped region in the Fourier
space. The foregrounds are confined to this wedge because of their smooth
spectral properties which allows one to estimate the HI power spectrum in the
foreground-free portion, known as the reionization window. The estimate of the
spherically averaged power spectrum in the window, however, differs from the
true value because of the line of sight anisotropies in the signal. The
difference can be estimated and taken into account for a given reion- ization
model by expanding the power spectrum in terms of the Legendre polynomials.
This corrected power spectrum, called as the clustering wedges, can then be
used for comparing the model predictions with the observations. In this work,
we carefully ex- amine whether the clustering wedges are appropriate for such
model comparisons and whether they provide truly unbiased constraints on the
EoR parameters. We use the excursion-set based semi-numerical simulations,
coupled with MCMC-based statistical methods, for our analysis. We find that the
clustering wedges not only yield faithful constraints, the statistical
uncertainties on the parameter values too are comparable to those obtained
using the data without the presence of any foregrounds. We also find that the
clustering wedges are helpful in breaking the degeneracies between different
EoR model parameters.

  1) to clarify the difference between contact and weak-contact interactions
(called point interactions in [A] in the case $N=2$) in three dimensions and
their role in providing spectral properties and boundary conditions.
  2) to analyze the same problem in two dimensions.
  Both contact and weak-contact are ""zero range interactions"" or equivalently
self-adjoint extension of the symmetric operator $\hat H_0$, the free
hamiltonian for a system of $N$ particles, restricted to functions that vanish
in some neighborhood of the \emph{contact manyfold} $ \Gamma = \cup_{i,j} \{
x_i - x_j = 0\} \;\; i \not= j =1 \ldots N $.
  The \emph{hamiltonian formulation} of a weak-contact interaction requires the
presence of a zero energy resonance.
  Both can be obtained, for $N \geq 3$, as scaling limit, in the strong
resolvent sense, of hamiltonians with two-body central potentials of very short
range; the scaling is different in the two cases.
  The contact ""potential"" is a distribution on the ""contact manyfold""; the
laplacian is now two dimensional and the scaling properties under dilation of
the laplacian are now the same as those of the contact interaction.
  This makes a major difference in the spectral properties. Contact interaction
defines now a hamiltonian system.
  In two dimensions one can consider a hamiltonian system of three particle of
mass $m$ having as potential a contact potential and \emph{the product of two
weak-contact potentials}. In the limit $ m \to \infty$ their wave functions
have vanishingly small support and the system may be regarded as a \emph{point
with internal structure}; the spectrum has an essential singularity at the
bottom of the continuous part. The Wave Operator for the interaction with a
fourth particle extends to a bounded map on $L ^p $ for all $ 1 < p < \infty $

(BSTs), two classical algorithms for data structure maintenance. The pairing
heap is a simple and efficient ""self-adjusting"" heap, introduced in 1986 by
Fredman, Sedgewick, Sleator, and Tarjan. In the multipass variant (one of the
original pairing heap variants described by Fredman et al.) the minimum item is
extracted via repeated pairing rounds in which neighboring siblings are linked.
  Path-balanced BSTs, proposed by Sleator (Subramanian, 1996), are a natural
alternative to Splay trees (Sleator and Tarjan, 1983). In a path-balanced BST,
whenever an item is accessed, the search path leading to that item is
re-arranged into a balanced tree.
  Despite their simplicity, both algorithms turned out to be difficult to
analyse. Fredman et al. showed that operations in multipass pairing heaps take
amortized $O(\log{n} \cdot \log\log{n} / \log\log\log{n})$ time. For searching
in path-balanced BSTs, Balasubramanian and Raman showed in 1995 the same
amortized time bound of $O(\log{n} \cdot \log\log{n} / \log\log\log{n})$, using
a different argument.
  In this paper we show an explicit connection between the two algorithms and
improve the two bounds to $O\left(\log{n} \cdot 2^{\log^{\ast}{n}} \cdot
\log^{\ast}{n}\right)$, respectively $O\left(\log{n} \cdot 2^{\log^{\ast}{n}}
\cdot (\log^{\ast}{n})^2 \right)$, where $\log^{\ast}(\cdot)$ denotes the very
slowly growing iterated logarithm function. These are the first improvements in
more than three, resp. two decades, approaching in both cases the
information-theoretic lower bound of $\Omega(\log{n})$.

Therefore, when a new update when arrives at the source and it is transmitting
another update, the source needs to decide whether to skip the new arrival or
to switch to it, in order to minimize the expected average AoI at the
destination. We prove that within a broadly defined class of online policies,
the optimal policy should be a renewal policy, and has a sequential switching
property. We then show that the optimal decision the source should take in any

a suite of fault rocks (a healed cataclasite, an unhealed breccia and the
intact parent rock) from the pseudotachylyte-bearing Gole Larghe fault in the
Adamello batholith (Italy), and use them as inputs in numerical simulations of
thermal pressurisation. We find that the melting temperature can be reached
only if damaged, unhealed rock properties are used. A tenfold increase in
permeability, or a fourfold increase in pore compressibility of the intact rock
is required to achieve melting. Our results emphasise the importance of damage
processes that strongly modify fault rock properties and dynamic weakening
processes during earthquake propagation.

engine efficiency. Therefore, and due to a stabilized, robust combustion, a
specific adjustment of component temperatures is desirable in highly transient
conditions. In this paper, a turbocharged SI engine is investigated numerically
concerning the potential regulation of temperatures, including heat fluxes,
only by controlling the water mass flow rate. Using two independent models, a
simplified lumped capacity model and a detailed three-dimensional CFD-CHT
simulation, an efficient, two-stage calculation method is suggested for an
optimized determination of control strategies and their parameters. This
complements existing published works which usually control more than one
parameter, but use one model. Different control strategies, like feed forward
or feedback controllers, are proposed and compared. In addition, a more
holistic approach is presented performing a Monte Carlo simulation which
evaluates temperatures, as well as hydraulic pumping losses. Using expedient
control strategies and parameters, it could be shown that the engine
temperatures can be effectively regulated within a wide range. The two
different models show partly similar results, and the efficient, two-stage
optimization method has proven its worth. However, there are some significant
differences between simplified and detailed modelling which are worth
mentioning.

degeneracy). When the degeneracy is lifted, spin textures can be directly
observed in momentum space, as in topological insulators or in strong Rashba
materials. The existence of spin textures with Kramers degeneracy, however, is
very difficult to observe directly. Here, we use quantum interference
measurements combined with first-principle band structure calculations to
provide evidence for the existence of hidden entanglement between spin and
momentum in the antiperovskite-type 3D Dirac material Sr$_3$SnO. We find robust
weak antilocalization (WAL) independent of the position of $E_\mathrm{F}$. The
observed WAL signal at low doping is fitted using a single interference
channel, which implies that the different Dirac valleys are mixed by disorder.
Notably, this mixing does not suppress WAL, suggesting contrasting interference
physics compared to graphene. We identify scattering among axially
spin-momentum locked states as a key process that leads to a spin-orbital
entanglement, giving rise to robust WAL. Our work sheds light on the subtle
role of spin and pseudospin, when both could contribute to the same quantum

direct detection experiments and/or neutrino telescopes. We find that current

this manuscript, we evaluate an ASIC- based readout for digitizing all signals
coming from analog photosensors. Validation results with one-to-one coupling
resulted in a Coincidence Time Resolution (CTR) of 202 ps FWHM. Providing
timing resolution when using detectors based on monolithic crystals is however
challenging. The wide distribution of scintillation light on the photosensors
causes a poor SNR, which makes the system sensible to false triggering and to
time walk errors. In this direction, we present a calibration method, designed
to correct all recorded timestamps and also to compensate variations in
time-paths among all channels. Thereafter, a CTR improvement nearing 45% is
observed for all measurements. Moreover, we show a novel approach that
describes the use of averaging methods to assign a single timestamp to each
gamma impact. This approach results in a further improvement of the CTR in the
range of 100 ps FWHM, reaching a time resolution of 585 ps FWHM when using a

most state-of-the-art architectures using a large-scale corpus of Western tonal
music, instead preferring to use relatively small datasets containing chord
annotations from contemporary genres like jazz, pop, and rock.
  Using symbolic representations of prominent instrumental genres from the

scheme to (1) evaluate Finite Context (or n-gram) models and Recurrent Neural

is unclear whether the trends seen in the multiplicity properties of their more
massive counterparts hold for the very coolest brown dwarfs. We present results
from a search for substellar and planetary-mass companions to a sample of 12
ultracool T8$-$Y0 field brown dwarfs with the Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field
Camera 3. We find no evidence for resolved binary companions among our sample
down to separations of 0.7$-$2.5 AU. Combining our survey with prior searches,
we place some of the first statistically robust constraints to date on the
multiplicity properties of the coolest, lowest-mass brown dwarfs in the field.
Accounting for observational biases and incompleteness, we derive a binary
frequency of $f = 5.5^{+5.2}_{-3.3}$% for T5$-$Y0 brown dwarfs at separations
of 1.5$-$1000 AU, for an overall binary fraction of $f_\mathrm{tot} = 8\pm6$%.
Modelling the projected separation as a lognormal distribution, we find a peak
in separation at $\rho_0 = 2.9^{+0.8}_{-1.4}$ AU with a logarithmic width of
$\sigma = 0.21^{+0.14}_{-0.08}$. We infer a mass ratio distribution peaking
strongly towards unity, with a power law index of $\gamma = 6.1^{+4.0}_{-2.7}$,
reinforcing the significance of the detection of a tighter and higher mass
ratio companion population around lower-mass primaries. These results are
consistent with prior studies and support the idea of a decreasing binary
frequency with spectral type in the Galactic field.

complement the chemistry-centered models of force generation in muscles by
mechanics-centered models. The physical mechanisms of interest can be grouped
into two classes: passive and active. The main passive effect is the fast force
recovery which does not require the detachment of myosin cross-bridges from
actin filaments and can operate without a specialized supply ATP. In mechanical
terms, it can be viewed as a collective folding-unfolding phenomenon in the
system of interacting bistable units and modeled by near equilibrium Langevin
dynamics. The parallel active force generation mechanism operates at slow
timescales, requires detachment and is crucially dependent on ATP hydrolysis.
The underlying mechanical processes take place far from equilibrium and are
represented by stochastic models with broken time reversal symmetry implying
non-potentiality, correlated noise or multiple reservoirs. The modeling
approaches reviewed in this paper deal with both active and passive processes
and support from the mechanical perspective the biological point of view that
phenomena involved in slow (active) and fast (passive) force generation are
tightly intertwined. They reveal, however, that biochemical studies in
solution, macroscopic physiological measurements and structural analysis do not
provide by themselves all the necessary insights into the functioning of the
contractile system. In particular, the reviewed body of work emphasizes the
important role of long-range interactions and criticality in securing the
targeted mechanical response in the physiological regime of isometric
contractions. The importance of the purely mechanical microscale modeling is
accentuated at the end of the paper where we address the puzzling issue of the
stability of muscle response on the so called descending limb of the isometric
tetanus.

continuous embedding vector, which is equivalent to applying a linear
transformation based on a ""one-hot"" encoding of the discrete symbols. Despite
its simplicity, such approach yields the number of parameters that grows
linearly with the vocabulary size and can lead to overfitting. In this work, we
propose a much more compact K-way D-dimensional discrete encoding scheme to
replace the ""one-hot"" encoding. In the proposed ""KD encoding"", each symbol is
represented by a $D$-dimensional code with a cardinality of $K$, and the final
symbol embedding vector is generated by composing the code embedding vectors.
To end-to-end learn semantically meaningful codes, we derive a relaxed discrete
optimization approach based on stochastic gradient descent, which can be
generally applied to any differentiable computational graph with an embedding
layer. In our experiments with various applications from natural language
processing to graph convolutional networks, the total size of the embedding
layer can be reduced up to 98\% while achieving similar or better performance.

of the reconstruction procedure for noisy and noise-free simulated data. Our
results suggest that the use of deterministic-CDI reconstructions, as a seed

evolved into a necessary feature of any successful business for reaching
internal and external audiences. In this paper, video streaming over
distributed storage is considered where the video segments are encoded using an
erasure code for better reliability. There are multiple parallel streams
between each server and the edge router. For each client request, we need to
determine the subset of servers to get the data, as well as one of the parallel
stream from each chosen server. In order to have this scheduling, this paper
proposes a two-stage probabilistic scheduling. The selection of video quality
is also chosen with a certain probability distribution. With these parameters,
the playback time of video segments is determined by characterizing the
download time of each coded chunk for each video segment. Using the playback
times, a bound on the moment generating function of the stall duration is used
to bound the mean stall duration. Based on this, we formulate an optimization
problem to jointly optimize the convex combination of mean stall duration and
average video quality for all requests, where the two-stage probabilistic
scheduling, probabilistic video quality selection, bandwidth split among
parallel streams, and auxiliary bound parameters can be chosen. This non-convex
problem is solved using an efficient iterative algorithm. Evaluation results
show significant improvement in QoE metrics for cloud-based video as compared

capabilities of our approach by applying it to a laser diode operated in the
threshold region. In particular, we are able to monitor the emission dynamics
of the diode switching back and forth between lasing and spontaneous emission
with a $g^{(2)}(0)$-sampling rate of 100 kHz.

will adopt the Front-End Link eXchange (FELIX) system as the interface between
the data acquisition, detector control and TTC (Timing, Trigger and Control)
systems and new or updated trigger and detector front-end electronics. FELIX
will function as a router between custom serial links from front-end ASICs and
FPGAs to data collection and processing components via a commodity switched
network. Links may aggregate many slower links or be a single high bandwidth
link. FELIX will also forward the LHC bunch-crossing clock, fixed latency
trigger accepts and resets received from the TTC system to front-end
electronics. The FELIX system uses commodity server technology in combination
with FPGA-based PCIe I/O cards. The FELIX servers will run a software routing
platform serving data to network clients. Commodity servers connected to FELIX
systems via the same network will run the new Software Readout Driver (SW ROD)
infrastructure for event fragment building and buffering, with support for
detector or trigger specific data processing, and will serve the data upon
request to the ATLAS High Level Trigger for Event Building and Selection. This
paper will cover the design and status of FELIX, the SW ROD, results of early
performance testing and integration tests with several ATLAS front-ends.

expressivity of deep neural networks (deep NNs) as well as the uncertainty
quantification property of Gaussian processes (GPs). We generalize the current
NNGP to first include a larger number of hyperparameters and subsequently train
the model by maximum likelihood estimation. Unlike previous works on NNGP that
targeted classification, here we apply the generalized NNGP to function
approximation and to solving partial differential equations (PDEs).
Specifically, we develop an analytical iteration formula to compute the
covariance function of GP induced by deep NN with an error-function
nonlinearity. We compare the performance of the generalized NNGP for function
approximations and PDE solutions with those of GPs and fully-connected NNs. We
observe that for smooth functions the generalized NNGP can yield the same order
of accuracy with GP, while both NNGP and GP outperform deep NN. For non-smooth
functions, the generalized NNGP is superior to GP and comparable or superior to
deep NN.

of the small samples size in each class and the heavy overlaps among classes.
To effectively solve these problems, we propose novel Error Correcting Output
Code (ECOC) algorithm by Enhance Class Separability related Data Complexity
measures during encoding process, named as ECOCECS. In this algorithm, two
nearest neighbor related DC measures are deployed to extract the intrinsic
overlapping information from microarray data. Our ECOC algorithm aims to search
an optimal class split scheme by minimizing these measures. The class splitting
process ends when each class is separated from others, and then the class
assignment scheme is mapped as a coding matrix. Experiments are carried out on
five microarray datasets, and results demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of our method in comparison with six state-of-art ECOC methods. In
short, our work confirm the probability of applying DC to ECOC framework.

different intensities. Thus, this system contains two of the main ingredients
of modern Deep neural network architectures: Hebbian interactions to store
patterns of information and multiple layers coding different levels of
correlations. The model is completely solvable in the low-load regime with a
suitable generalization of the Hamilton-Jacobi technique, despite the
Hamiltonian can be a non-definite quadratic form of the magnetizations. The
family of multi-species Hopfield model includes, as special cases, the 3-layers
Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) with Gaussian hidden layer and the
Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) model.

cable) is supplied with a very high-frequency electric signal, the information
between the walls propagates with an appreciable delay, due to the finiteness
of the speed of light. The configuration is typical of cavities having size
larger than the wavelength of the injected signal. Such a non rare situation,
in practice, may cause a break down of the performances of the device. We show
that the classical Coulomb's law and Maxwell's equations do not correctly
predict this behavior. Therefore, we provide an extension of the modeling
equations that allows for a more reliable determination of the electromagnetic
field during the evolution process. The main issue is that, even in vacuum (no
dielectric inside the device), the fast variation of the signal produces sinks
and sources in the electric field, giving rise to zones where the divergence is
not zero. These regions are well balanced, so that their average in the domain
is zero. However, this behavior escapes the usual treatment with classical
electromagnetism.

that only two spin operators satisfy the spin algebra and transform properly
under the Lorentz transformation, which admit the two inequivalent
finite-dimensional representations for the Lorentz generators through the
complexification of the $SU(2)$ group. In case that the Poincar\'e group is
extended by parity operation, the spin operator in the direct sum
representation of the two inequivalent representations, called the new spin
distinguished from the Dirac spin, is shown to be equivalent to axial and
Hermitian spin operators for particle and antiparticle. We have shown that for
spin $1/2$, the Noether conserved current for a rotation can be divided into
separately conserved orbital and spin part for the new spin, unlike for the
Dirac spin. This implies that the new spin not the Dirac spin provides good
quantum observables.

already provides severe constraints. In particular, it requires that a set of
physically distinguishable cases is naturally equipped with the mathematical
structures (i.e. second-countable Kolmogorov topologies and $\sigma$-algebras)
that form the foundation of manifold theory, differential geometry, measure
theory, probability theory and all the major branches of mathematics currently

structures and provides a strong justification for their use in science. Most
importantly it provides a formal framework to incorporate additional
