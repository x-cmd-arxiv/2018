black holes that includes gravitational modes beyond the dominant $(\ell,|m|) =
(2,2)$ mode, specifically $(\ell,|m|)=(2,1),(3,3),(4,4),(5,5)$. Our multipolar
waveform model incorporates recent (resummed) post-Newtonian results for the
inspiral and information from 157 numerical-relativity simulations, and 13
waveforms from black-hole perturbation theory for the (plunge-)merger and
ringdown. We quantify the improved accuracy including higher-order modes by
computing the faithfulness of the waveform model against the
numerical-relativity waveforms used to construct the model. We define the
faithfulness as the match maximized over time, phase of arrival,
gravitational-wave polarization and sky position of the waveform model, and
averaged over binary orientation, gravitational-wave polarization and sky
position of the numerical-relativity waveform. When the waveform model contains
only the $(2,2)$ mode, we find that the averaged faithfulness to
numerical-relativity waveforms containing all modes with $\ell \leq$ 5 ranges
from $90\%$ to $99.9\%$ for binaries with total mass $20-200 M_\odot$ (using
the Advanced LIGO's design noise curve). By contrast, when the
$(2,1),(3,3),(4,4),(5,5)$ modes are also included in the model, the
faithfulness improves to $99\%$ for all but four configurations in the
numerical-relativity catalog, for which the faithfulness is greater than
$98.5\%$. Using our results, we also develop also a (stand-alone) waveform
model for the merger-ringdown signal, calibrated to numerical-relativity
waveforms, which can be used to measure multiple quasi-normal modes. The
multipolar waveform model can be extended to include spin-precession, and will
be employed in upcoming observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Virgo.

Fields (m-GCRF) structured regression model for dealing with missing labels in
partially observed temporal attributed graphs. This method is aimed at learning
with both labeled and unlabeled parts and effectively predicting future values
in a graph. The method is even capable of learning from nodes for which the
response variable is never observed in history, which poses problems for many
state-of-the-art models that can handle missing data. The proposed model is
characterized for various missingness mechanisms on 500 synthetic graphs. The
benefits of the new method are also demonstrated on a challenging application
for predicting precipitation based on partial observations of climate variables
in a temporal graph that spans the entire continental US. We also show that the
method can be useful for optimizing the costs of data collection in climate
applications via active reduction of the number of weather stations to
consider. In experiments on these real-world and synthetic datasets we show
that the proposed model is consistently more accurate than alternative
semi-supervised structured models, as well as models that either use imputation

number of uses of an arbitrary quantum channel assisted by k-extendible
channels at no cost. These bounds are significantly tighter than previously
known bounds for both the depolarizing and erasure channels. Finally, we

unconditionally secure communications, enhanced channel capacities, and

information processing devices continue to transition from the lab to the
field, the demand for the foundational infrastructure connecting them with each
other and their users---the quantum internet---will only increase. Due to the
remarkable success of frequency multiplexing and control in the classical
internet, quantum information encoding in optical frequency offers an
intriguing synergy with state-of-the-art fiber-optic networks. Yet coherent
quantum frequency operations prove extremely challenging, due to the
difficulties in mixing frequencies efficiently, arbitrarily, in parallel, and
with low noise. Here we implement an original approach based on a
reconfigurable quantum frequency processor, designed to perform arbitrary
manipulations of spectrally encoded qubits. This processor's unique tunability
allows us to demonstrate frequency-bin Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with
record-high 94% visibility. Furthermore, by incorporating such tunability with
our method's natural parallelizability, we synthesize independent quantum
frequency gates in the same device, realizing the first high-fidelity flip of
spectral correlations on two entangled photons. Compared to quantum frequency
mixing approaches based on nonlinear optics, our linear method removes the need
for additional pump fields and significantly reduces background noise. Our
results demonstrate multiple functionalities in parallel in a single platform,
representing a huge step forward for the frequency-multiplexed quantum
internet.

by a variance decomposition approach. Identifying key system levers and
quantifying their strength is not straightforward in complex system dynamics

sensitivity analysis (VBSA) offers a systematic, global approach to assessing
system dynamics models because it addresses nonlinear responses and interactive
effects. Especially when a large model's size makes manual exploration of the
input space difficult and time-consuming, the approach can help to provide a

shows significant connection with the 5 GHz nuclear radio emission suggesting a
stronger link between the former and the SMBH evolution in these galaxies. In
addition, it is seen that various structural and dynamical properties of the

of the hot big bang model. These neutrinos were a dominant component of the
energy density in the early universe and, therefore, played an important role
in the evolution of cosmological perturbations. The energy density of the
cosmic neutrino background has been measured using the abundances of light
elements and the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). A
complementary and more robust probe is a distinct shift in the temporal phase
of sound waves in the primordial plasma which is produced by fluctuations in
the neutrino density and has recently been detected in the CMB. In this paper,
we report on the first constraint on this neutrino-induced phase shift in the
spectrum of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) of the BOSS DR12 data.
Constraining the acoustic scale using Planck data while marginalizing over the
effects of neutrinos in the CMB, we find a non-zero phase shift at greater than
95\% confidence. We also demonstrate the robustness of this result in
simulations and forecasts. Besides providing a new test of the cosmic neutrino
background, our work is the first application of the BAO signal to early
universe physics and a non-trivial confirmation of the standard cosmological
history.

hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy. We assume, as is appropriate for relevant cases of
interest, that the probe laser intensity $I$ determines both the Rabi frequency
$(\propto\sqrt{I})$ and the frequency shift to the atomic transition $(\propto
I)$ during probe laser interactions with the atom. The spectroscopic signal
depends on these two quantities that co-vary with fluctuations in the probe
laser intensity. Introducing a simple model for the fluctuations, we find that
the signature robustness of the hyper-Ramsey method can be compromised. Taking
the Yb$^+$ electric octupole clock transition as an example, we quantify the
clock error under different levels of probe laser intensity fluctuations.

  Theory of Equivariant Neural Networks)",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Group equivariant and steerable convolutional neural networks (regular and
steerable G-CNNs) have recently emerged as a very effective model class for
learning from signal data such as 2D and 3D images, video, and other data where
symmetries are present. In geometrical terms, regular G-CNNs represent data in
terms of scalar fields (""feature channels""), whereas the steerable G-CNN can
also use vector or tensor fields (""capsules"") to represent data. In algebraic
terms, the feature spaces in regular G-CNNs transform according to a regular
representation of the group G, whereas the feature spaces in Steerable G-CNNs
transform according to the more general induced representations of G. In order
to make the network equivariant, each layer in a G-CNN is required to
intertwine between the induced representations associated with its input and
output space.
  In this paper we present a general mathematical framework for G-CNNs on
homogeneous spaces like Euclidean space or the sphere. We show, using
elementary methods, that the layers of an equivariant network are convolutional
if and only if the input and output feature spaces transform according to an
induced representation. This result, which follows from G.W. Mackey's abstract
theory on induced representations, establishes G-CNNs as a universal class of
equivariant network architectures, and generalizes the important recent work of
Kondor & Trivedi on the intertwiners between regular representations.

irradiance using a dynamical atmosphere-ocean-sea ice climate model in an
Aquaplanet configuration. Three stable climate states are obtained that differ
in the extent of the sea ice cover. For low values of irradiance the model
simulates a Cryoplanet that has a perennial global sea ice cover. By increasing
stellar irradiance, transitions occur to an Uncapped Cryoplanet with a
perennial equatorial sea ice belt, and eventually to an Aquaplanet with no ice.
Using an emulator model we find that the Uncapped Cryoplanet is a robust stable
state for a range of irradiance and high obliquities and contrast earlier
results that high-obliquity climate states with an equatorial ice belt may be
unsustainable or unachievable. When the meridional ocean heat flux is
strengthened, the parameter range permitting a stable Uncapped Cryoplanet
decreases due to melting of equatorial sea ice. Beyond a critical threshold of
meridional ocean heat flux, the perennial equatorial ice belt disappears.
Therefore, a vigorous ocean circulation may render it unstable. Our results
suggest that perennial equatorial ice cover is a viable climate state of a
high-obliquity exoplanet. However, due to multiple equilibria, this state is
only reached from more glaciated conditions, and not from less glaciated
conditions.

basic concept (section 2): Cosmic rays from exploding massive stars with winds
always show two cosmic ray components at the same time: (i) the weaker polar
cap component only produced by Diffusive Shock Acceleration with a cut-off at
the knee, and (ii) the stronger $4 \pi$ component with a down-turn to a steeper
power-law spectrum at the knee, and a final cutoff at the ankle. In section 3
we use the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) data to differentiate these two
cosmic ray spectral components. The ensuing secondary spectra can explain
anti-protons, lower energy positrons, and other secondary particles. Triplet
pair production may explain the higher energy positron AMS data. In section 4
we test this paradigm with a theory of injection based on a combined effect of
first and second ionization potential; this reproduces the ratio of Cosmic Ray
source abundances to source material abundances. In section 5 we interpret the
compact radio source 41.9+58 in the starburst galaxy M82 as a recent binary
black hole merger, with an accompanying gamma ray burst. This can also explain
the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) data in the Northern sky. Thus, by
studying the cosmic ray particles, their abundances at knee energies, and their
spectra, we can learn about what drives these stars to produce the observed
cosmic rays.

solution of the exact Peierls-Boltzmann equation (PBE), the relaxation time

Debye model calculations in RTA for a three-dimensional periodic system where

segments with period $L$ in $x$. The ratio $L/\ell_{\rm min}$ is varied from 6

illustrate the expected local (diffusive) response for $\ell_{\rm min}\ll L$,

maintaining estimates of important information that is not presently available.
Recently, progress has been made with artificial intelligence (AI) agents that
learn to perform tasks from sensory input, even at a human level, by merging
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with deep neural networks, and the
excitement surrounding these results has led to the pursuit of related ideas as
explanations of non-human animal learning. However, we demonstrate that
contemporary RL algorithms struggle to solve simple tasks when enough
information is concealed from the sensors of the agent, a property called
""partial observability"". An obvious requirement for handling partially observed
tasks is access to extensive memory, but we show memory is not enough; it is
critical that the right information be stored in the right format. We develop a
model, the Memory, RL, and Inference Network (MERLIN), in which memory
formation is guided by a process of predictive modeling. MERLIN facilitates the
solution of tasks in 3D virtual reality environments for which partial
observability is severe and memories must be maintained over long durations.
Our model demonstrates a single learning agent architecture that can solve

simplifying assumptions about the dimensionality of sensory input or the

problem is that the computational requirements for next-generation

currently unfeasible. We propose a new method to save computational time for
spectroscopic angular power spectra. This hybrid method is modelled on the
Fourier power spectrum approach of treating relatively thick redshift bins
(redshift width ~0.1) as separate surveys. In the hybrid method, each thick bin
is further subdivided into thin bins (redshift width ~0.01); all the
correlations within each thick bin are computed, while cross-bin correlations
beyond the thick bins are neglected. Constraints on cosmological parameters
from the hybrid method are comparable to those from the standard galaxy power
spectrum analysis - but they have the advantage that cosmic evolution,
wide-angle and lensing effects are naturally included, while no
Alcock-Paczynski correction is needed. The hybrid method delivers much tighter
constraints than a 2D tomographic approach that is typical for photometric
surveys, which considers only thick bins and the correlations between them.
Furthermore, for standard cosmological parameters our method is not biased by
neglecting the effects of lensing on number counts, while the tomographic
method is strongly biased.

collapse of a molecular cloud core to form a protostar. Some calculations
include radiative transfer in the flux-limited diffusion approximation while
others employ a barotropic equation of state. We cover a wide parameter space,
with mass-to-flux ratios ranging from $\mu = 5$ to $20$; initial turbulent
amplitudes ranging from a laminar calculation (i.e. where the Mach number,
$\mathscr{M} = 0$) to transonic $\mathscr{M} = 1$; and initial rotation rates
from $\beta_\mathrm{rot} = 0.005$ to $0.02$. We first show that using a
radiative transfer scheme produces warmer pseudo-discs than the barotropic
equation of state, making them more stable. We then `shake' the core by
increasing the initial turbulent velocity field, and find that at all three
mass-to-flux ratios transonic cores are weakly bound and do not produce
pseudo-discs; $\mathscr{M} = 0.3$ cores produce very disrupted discs; and
$\mathscr{M} = 0.1$ cores produce discs broadly comparable to a laminar core.
In our previous paper (arXiv:1701.08741), we showed that a pseudo-disc coupled
with sufficient magnetic field is necessary to form a bipolar outflow. Here we
show that only weakly turbulent cores exhibit collimated jets. We finally take
the $\mathscr{M} = 1.0$, $\mu = 5$ core and `stir' it by increasing the initial
angular momentum, finding that once the degree of rotational energy exceeds the
turbulent energy in the core the disc returns, with a corresponding (though
slower), outflow. These conclusions place constraints on the initial mixtures
of rotation and turbulence in molecular cloud cores which are conducive to the
formation of bipolar outflows early in the star formation process.

whether the IMF is in fact universal across galactic environments, a galactic
initial mass function (IGIMF), or whether it is an average of local IMFs. One
of the long-standing problems in resolving this question and in the study of
young clusters is observational: the emission from multiple sources is
frequently seen as blended because at different wavelengths or with different
telescopes the beam sizes are different. The confusion hinders our ability to
fully characterize clustered star formation. Here we present a new method that
uses a genetic algorithm and Bayesian inference to fit the blended SEDs and
images of individual YSOs in confused clusters. We apply this method to the
infrared photometry of a sample comprising 70 Spitzer-selected, low-mass
($M_{\rm{cl}}<100~\rm{M}_{\odot}$) young clusters in the galactic plane, and
use the derived physical parameters to investigate the distributions of masses
and evolutionary stages of clustered YSOs, and the implications of those
distributions for studies of the IMF and the different models of star
formation. We find that for low-mass clusters composed of class I and class II
YSOs, there exists a non-trivial relationship between the total stellar mass of
the cluster ($M_{\rm{cl}}$) and the mass of its most massive member
($m_{\rm{max}}$). The properties of the derived correlation are most compatible
with the random sampling of a Kroupa IMF, with a fundamental high-mass limit of
$150~\rm{M}_{\odot}$. Our results are also compatible with SPH models that
predict a dynamical termination of the accretion in protostars, with massive
stars undergoing this stopping at later times in their evolution.

transit observations. We used the Hubble Space Telescope to observe the transit
in the FUV over 3 epochs in Apr. 2016, Jan. 2017, and Feb. 2017. These
observations reveal significant short- and long-term variability in 55 Cnc
chromospheric emission lines. In the last 2 epochs, we detected a larger flux
in the C III, Si III, and Si IV lines after the planet passed the approaching
quadrature, followed by a flux decrease in the Si IV doublet. In the second
epoch these variations are contemporaneous with flux decreases in the Si II and
C II doublet. All epochs show flux decreases in the N V doublet as well, albeit
at different orbital phases. These flux decreases are consistent with
absorption from optically thin clouds of gas, are mostly localized at low and
redshifted radial velocities in the star rest frame, and occur preferentially
before and during the transit. These 3 points make it unlikely that the
variations are purely stellar, yet we show that the occulting material is also
unlikely to originate from the planet. We tentatively propose that the motion
of 55 Cnc e at the fringes of the stellar corona leads to the formation of a
cool coronal rain. The inhomogeneity and temporal evolution of the stellar
corona would be responsible for the differences between the visits. Additional
variations are detected in the C II doublet in the first epoch and in the O I
triplet in all epochs with a different behavior that points toward intrinsic
stellar variability. Further observations at FUV wavelengths are required to

across the inner few kpc of each target. We combine these data with short
spacing information from the IRAM large program EMPIRE, archival CO maps,
tracers of stellar structure and recent star formation, and recent HCN surveys
by Bigiel et al. and Usero et al. We test the degree to which changes in the
dense gas fraction drive changes in the SFR. $I_{HCN}/I_{CO}$ (tracing the
dense gas fraction) correlates strongly with $I_{CO}$ (tracing molecular gas
surface density), stellar surface density, and dynamical equilibrium pressure,
$P_{DE}$. Therefore, $I_{HCN}/I_{CO}$ becomes very low and HCN becomes very
faint at large galactocentric radii, where ratios as low as $I_{HCN}/I_{CO}
\sim 0.01$ become common. The apparent ability of dense gas to form stars,
$\Sigma_{SFR}/\Sigma_{dense}$ (where $\Sigma_{dense}$ is traced by the HCN
intensity and the star formation rate is traced by a combination of H$\alpha$
and 24$\mu$m emission), also depends on environment.
$\Sigma_{SFR}/\Sigma_{dense}$ decreases in regions of high gas surface density,
high stellar surface density, and high $P_{DE}$. Statistically, these
correlations between environment and both $\Sigma_{SFR}/\Sigma_{dense}$ and
$I_{HCN}/I_{CO}$ are stronger than that between apparent dense gas fraction
($I_{HCN}/I_{CO}$) and the apparent molecular gas star formation efficiency
$\Sigma_{SFR}/\Sigma_{mol}$. We show that these results are not specific to
HCN.

increased planet occurrence rates for small planet candidates ($R_p<1.25

estimated by the more common inverse detection efficiency method. Our improved
methodology estimates that the occurrence rate density of small planet
candidates in the habitable zone of solar-type stars is $1.6^{+1.2}_{-0.5}$ per
factor of 2 in planet radius and orbital period. Additionally, we observe a
local minimum in the occurrence rate for strong planet candidates marginalized
over orbital period between 1.5 and 2$R_{\oplus}$ that is consistent with
previous studies. For future improvements, the forward modeling approach of ABC
is ideally suited to incorporating multiple populations, such as planets,
astrophysical false positives and pipeline false alarms, to provide accurate
planet occurrence rates and uncertainties. Furthermore, ABC provides a
practical statistical framework for answering complex questions (e.g.,
frequency of different planetary architectures) and providing sound
uncertainties, even in the face of complex selection effects, observational
biases, and follow-up strategies. In summary, ABC offers a powerful tool for
accurately characterizing a wide variety of astrophysical populations.

a reliable and optimal integration of massive amount of distributed energy
resources (DERs) and facilitate distribution system management (DSM).
Accordingly, the objective is to coordinate the power injection at the DERs to
maintain certain quantities across the network, e.g., voltage magnitude, line
flows, or line losses, to be close to a desired profile. By and large, the
performance of the DSM algorithms has been challenged by two factors: i) the
possibly non strongly connected communication network over DERs that hinders
the coordination; ii) the dynamics of the real system caused by the DERs with
heterogeneous capabilities, time-varying operating conditions, and real-time
measurement mismatches. In this paper, we investigate the modeling and
algorithm design and analysis with the consideration of these two factors. In
particular, a game-theoretic characterization is first proposed to account for
a locally connected communication network over DERs, along with the analysis of
the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) therein. To achieve
the equilibrium in a distributed fashion, a projected-gradient-based
asynchronous DSM algorithm is then advocated. The algorithm performance,
including the convergence speed and the tracking error, is analytically

solution to this problem, we propose a novel active learning algorithm that
constrains the influence measures of the trained model. We prove that any two
predictors whose errors are close on both the original training distribution

influences that are also close. Further, we empirically demonstrate with
synthetic labelers that our algorithm trains models that (i) have similar
causal influences as the labeler's model, and (ii) generalize better to
out-of-distribution points while (iii) retaining their accuracy on

$TiO_2$ thin films considering the application as transparent conducting oxide
(TCO). Sets of thin films were prepared by sputtering a titanium target under
oxygen atmosphere on a quartz substrate at 400 or 500{\deg}C. Films were then
doped at the same temperature by 150 eV nitrogen ions. The films were prepared
in Anatase phase which was maintained after doping. Up to 30at% nitrogen
concentration was obtained at the surface, as determined by in situ x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Such high nitrogen concentration at the
surface lead to nitrogen diffusion into the bulk which reached about 25 nm.
Hall measurements indicate that average carrier density reached over $10^{19}
cm^{-3}$ with mobility in the range of $0.1$ to $1 cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}$.
Resistivity about $3.10^{-1} \Omega cm$ could be obtained with 85% light
transmission at 550 nm. These results indicate that low energy implantation is
an effective technique for $TiO_2$ doping that allows an accurate control of
the doping process independently from the TiO2 preparation. Moreover, this
doping route seems promising to attain high doping levels without significantly
affecting the film structure. Such approach could be relevant for preparation
of $N:TiO_2$ transparent conduction electrodes (TCE).

data analysis. Traditional image processing methods and tools require
time-consuming and labor-intensive efforts of manually fine-tuning parameters.
Slight variations of image setting may lead to poor segmentation results.
Recent development of deep convolutional neural networks(CNN) provides a
potentially efficient, general and robust method for segmentation. Most
existing CNN-based methods treat segmentation as a pixel-wise classification
problem. However, three unique problems of cell images adversely affect
segmentation accuracy: lack of established training dataset, few pixels on cell
boundaries, and ubiquitous blurry features. The problem becomes especially
severe with densely packed cells, where a pixel-wise classification method
tends to identify two neighboring cells with blurry shared boundary as one
cell, leading to poor cell count accuracy and affecting subsequent analysis.
Here we developed a different learning strategy that combines strengths of CNN
and watershed algorithm. The method first trains a CNN to learn Euclidean
distance transform of binary masks corresponding to the input images. Then
another CNN is trained to detect individual cells in the Euclidean distance
transform. In the third step, the watershed algorithm takes the outputs from
the previous steps as inputs and performs the segmentation. We tested the
combined method and various forms of the pixel-wise classification algorithm on
segmenting fluorescence and transmitted light images. The new method achieves
similar pixel accuracy but significant higher cell count accuracy than
pixel-wise classification methods do, and the advantage is most obvious when
applying on noisy images of densely packed cells.

late M-dwarf host. The planetary system was found from the analysis of the
microlensing event OGLE-2017-BLG-0482, wherein the planet signal appears as a
short-term anomaly to the smooth lensing light curve produced by the host.
Despite its weak signal and short duration, the planetary signal was firmly
detected from the dense and continuous coverage by three microlensing surveys.
We find a planet/host mass ratio of $q\sim 1.4\times 10^{-4}$. We measure the
microlens parallax $\pi_{\rm E}$ from the long-term deviation in the observed
lensing light curve, but the angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$ cannot be
measured because the source trajectory did not cross the planet-induced
caustic. Using the measured event timescale and the microlens parallax, we find
that the masses of the planet and the host are $M_{\rm p}=9.0_{-4.5}^{+9.0}\
M_\oplus$ and $M_{\rm host}=0.20_{-0.10}^{+0.20}\ M_\odot$, respectively, and
the projected separation between them is $a_\perp=1.8_{-0.7}^{+0.6}$ au. The
estimated distance to the lens is $D_{\rm L}=5.8_{-2.1}^{+1.8}$ kpc. The
discovery of the planetary system demonstrates that microlensing provides an

  Although there exist various approaches to consistency management and

improve performance through improved in-memory processing, but in particular
provide built-in high-level data processing functionality, such as filtering

systems: from the electrons in periodic lattices to the analogs in photonic,
phononic, plasmonic systems, and even quasicrystals. Recently, a thermalization
gap, an inaccessible range of photon statistics, was proposed for light in
disordered structures [Nat. Phys. 11, 930 (2015)], which is intrinsically
induced by the disorder-immune chiral symmetry and can be reflected by the
photon statistics. The lattice topology was further identified as a decisive
role in determining the photon statistics when the chiral symmetry is
satisfied. Being very distinct from one-dimensional lattices, the photon
statistics in ring lattices are dictated by its parity, i.e, odd or even sited.
Here, we for the first time experimentally observe a parity-induced
thermalization gap in strongly disordered ring photonic structures. In a
limited scale, though the light tends to be localized, we are still able to
find clear evidence of the parity-dependent disorder-immune chiral symmetry and
the resulting thermalization gap by measuring photon statistics, while strong
disorder-induced Anderson localization overwhelms such a phenomenon in
larger-scale structures. Our results shed new light on the relation among
symmetry, disorder, and localization, and may inspire new resources and
artificial devices for information processing and quantum control on a photonic

""Negation and separation of concepts in constructive systems"" (1959), David
Nelson introduced a logic called S with the aim of analyzing the constructive
content of provable negation statements in mathematics. Motivated by results
from Kleene, in ""On the Interpretation of Intuitionistic Number Theory"" (1945),
Nelson investigated a more symmetric recursive definition of truth, according
to which a formula could be either primitively verified or refuted. The logic S
was defined by means of a calculus lacking the contraction rule and having
infinitely many schematic rules, and no semantics was provided. This system
received little attention from researchers and it even remained unnoticed that
on its original presentation it was inconsistent. Fortunately, the
inconsistency was caused by typos and by a rule whose hypothesis and conclusion
were swapped.We investigate in the present study a corrected version of the
logic S, and focus at its propositional fragment, showing that it is
algebraizable (in fact, implicative) with respect to a certain special class of
involutive residuated lattices. We thus introduce the first (algebraic)
semantics for S as well as a finite Hilbert-style calculus equivalent to

particles are influenced by diffusion, flow, and a vertical force induced e.g.
by gravity or magnetism. The dynamics of the diffusion process are modeled by
multi-dimensional transfer functions in a spatio-temporal frequency domain.
Realistic boundary conditions are incorporated by the design of a feedback
loop. The result is a discrete-time semi-analytical model for the particle
concentration in the channel. The model is validated by comparison to
particle-based simulations. These numerical experiments reveal that the
particle concentration of the proposed semi-analytical model and the
particle-based model are in excellent agreement. The analytical form of the
proposed solution provides several benefits over purely numerical models, e.g.
high flexibility, existence of low run-time algorithms, extendability to
several kinds of boundary conditions, and analytical connection to parameters
from communication theory.

of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) schemes are two pivotal steps in MIMO
signal identification for both military and commercial applications.
Conventional approaches treat them as two independent problems, namely the
source number enumeration and the presence detection of space-time redundancy,
respectively. In this paper, we develop a joint blind identification algorithm
to determine the number of transmit antennas and MIMO scheme simultaneously. By
restructuring the received signals, we derive three subspace-rank features
based on the signal subspace-rank to determine the number of transmit antennas
and identify space-time redundancy. Then, a Gerschgorin radii-based method and
a feed-forward neural network are employed to calculate these three features,
and a minimal weighted norm-1 distance metric is utilized for decision making.
In particular, our approach can identify additional MIMO schemes, which most
previous works have not considered, and is compatible with both single-carrier
and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Simulation
results verify the viability of our proposed approach for single-carrier and
OFDM systems and demonstrate its favorable identification performance for a
short observation period with acceptable complexity.

ill-posed problem due to insufficient variability in illumination. Months-long
capture sessions are typically used in this setup, with little success on
shorter, single-day time intervals. In this paper, we investigate the solution
of outdoor PS over a single day, under different weather conditions. First, we
investigate the relationship between weather and surface reconstructability in
order to understand when natural lighting allows existing PS algorithms to
work. Our analysis reveals that partially cloudy days improve the conditioning
of the outdoor PS problem while sunny days do not allow the unambiguous
recovery of surface normals from photometric cues alone. We demonstrate that
calibrated PS algorithms can thus be employed to reconstruct Lambertian
surfaces accurately under partially cloudy days. Second, we solve the ambiguity
arising in clear days by combining photometric cues with prior knowledge on
material properties, local surface geometry and the natural variations in
outdoor lighting through a CNN-based, weakly-calibrated PS technique. Given a
sequence of outdoor images captured during a single sunny day, our method
robustly estimates the scene surface normals with unprecedented quality for the
considered scenario. Our approach does not require precise geolocation and
significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on images with real
lighting, showing that our CNN can combine efficiently learned priors and
photometric cues available during a single sunny day.

ranked according to the number of their voters, the number of votes grows
exponentially with the rank of the party. This so-called Zipf's law has been
reported before. We first show this correlation in results from recent
elections in Germany, France and republican primaries in the USA. However the
mechanism generating such feature remains so far unexplained. We develop a
mathematical model of voter grouping that is only based on the word of mouth
and not on political contents. The model is close to the infinite allele model

Strikingly, the model generates output agreeing very well with the observed
election data. We further identify a cannibalism effect in Germany, whereby
parties above the 5% threshold withdraw votes from parties just below the
threshold. We demonstrate that the number of parties present in the parliament
can be predicted given the number of parties standing for election. Finally,
the steady loss of big-tent parties in Germany in the last 20 years relates to
the increasing number of parties since 1975. We discuss the interpretation and

formation using a large set of numerical relativity simulations. We show that
they are initially endowed with angular momentum that significantly exceeds the
mass-shedding limit for rigidly-rotating equilibria. We find that
gravitational-wave (GW) emission is not able to remove this excess angular
momentum within the time over which solid body rotation should be achieved.
Instead, we argue that the excess angular momentum could be carried away by
massive winds. Long-lived merger remnants are also formed with larger
gravitational masses than those of rigidly-rotating NSs having the same number
of baryons. The excess mass is likely radiated in the form of neutrinos. The
evolution of long-lived remnants on the viscous timescale is thus determined by
the interplay of finite-temperature effects, mass ejection, and neutrinos with
potentially dramatic consequences for the remnants' properties and stability.
We also provide an empirical fit for the spin of the remnant at the end of its
viscous evolution as a function of its final mass, and we discuss the
implications for the magnetar model of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). Finally,
we investigate the possible electromagnetic signatures associated with the
viscous ejecta. Massive outflows possibly resulting from the formation of

GW events and SGRBs whose detection would provide smoking gun evidence for the

LaAs, and performing transport measurements, Angle Resolved Photoemission
Spectroscopy (ARPES), and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we show
that (a) LaAs retains all qualitative features characteristic of the XMR effect

the absence of a band inversion or a Dirac cone in LaAs indicates that topology

threshold functions. How many low-degree polynomial threshold functions are
there? The partial case of this problem for degree $d=1$ was solved by Zuev in
1989, who showed that the number $T(n,1)$ of linear threshold functions
satisfies $\log_2 T(n,1) \approx n^2$, up to smaller order terms. However the
number of polynomial threshold functions for any higher degrees, including
$d=2$, has remained open. We settle this problem for all fixed degrees $d

view, we address the novel problem of estimating an occlusion-reasoned semantic
scene layout in the top-view. This challenging problem not only requires an
accurate understanding of both the 3D geometry and the semantics of the visible

that learns to predict occluded portions of the scene layout by looking around
foreground objects like cars or pedestrians. But instead of hallucinating RGB

occluded areas enables a better transformation into the top-view. We further
show that this initial top-view representation can be significantly enhanced by
learning priors and rules about typical road layouts from simulated or, if
available, map data. Crucially, training our model does not require costly or
subjective human annotations for occluded areas or the top-view, but rather
uses readily available annotations for standard semantic segmentation. We
extensively evaluate and analyze our approach on the KITTI and Cityscapes data

(AVs and SAVs) will affect travel destinations and distances, mode choice, and
congestion. From a traffic perspective, although some congestion reduction may
be achieved (thanks to fewer crashes and tighter headways), car-trip
frequencies and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) are likely to rise significantly,
reducing the benefits of driverless vehicles. Congestion pricing (CP) and road
tolls are key tools for moderating demand and incentivizing more socially and
environmentally optimal travel choices. This work develops multiple CP and
tolling strategies in alternative future scenarios, and investigates their
effects on the Austin, Texas network conditions and traveler welfare, using the
agent-based simulation model MATSim. Results suggest that, while all pricing
strategies reduce congestion, their social welfare impacts differ in meaningful
ways. More complex and advanced strategies perform better in terms of traffic
conditions and traveler welfare, depending on the development of the mobility
landscape of autonomous driving. The possibility to refund users by reinvesting
toll revenues as traveler budgets plays a salient role in the overall
efficiency of each CP strategy as well as in the public acceptability.

Level RF control system. The new LCBI damper is independent of main LLRF
control components. In the test bench measurement, our new LCBI damper has good

in periodically perforated domains and associated with the Fourier-type

the construction of a reliable linearization scheme that allows us, by a
suitable choice of scaling arguments and stabilization constants, to prove the
weak solvability of the microscopic model. Asymptotic behaviors of the
microscopic solution with respect to the microscale parameter are thoroughly
investigated in the second theme, based upon several cases of scaling. In
particular, the variable scaling illuminates the trivial and non-trivial limits
at the macroscale, confirmed by certain rates of convergence. Relying on
classical results for homogenization of multiscale elliptic problems, we design
a modified two-scale asymptotic expansion to derive the corresponding
macroscopic equation, when the scaling choices are compatible. Moreover, we
prove the high-order corrector estimates for the homogenization limit in the
energy space $H^1$, using a large amount of energy-like estimates. A numerical
example is provided to corroborate the asymptotic analysis.

as points in an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, thereby facilitating

algorithms depends heavily on the choice of the Riemannian metric. In the
setting of plane curve shapes, attention has largely been focused on a
two-parameter family of first order Sobolev metrics, referred to as elastic

coordinate transformations for particular parameter values, such as the
well-known square-root velocity transform. In this paper, we extend the

power, with ion cyclotron resonant heating producing a more peaked profile than
neutral beam injection. Given the heating type dependence, the L-mode
temperature shape is nearly independent of the other control variables. The
H-mode temperature shape broadens as the effective charge, $Z_{eff}$,
increases. The line average L-mode temperature scales as $B_t^{.96}$(Power per

the ratio of line average density, $\bar{n}$, to the edge safety factor,
$q_{95}$. As $\bar{n}/q_{95}$ increases, the profile shape broadens. The
current, $I_p$, is the most important control variable for the normalized
H-mode density. As the current increases, the profile broadens and the gradient
at the edge sharpens. Increasing the heating power, especially the ion
cyclotron resonant heating, or decreasing the average density, peaks the H-mode

temporal structure. We observe that there are three unique attributes of video
QA compared with image QA: (1) it deals with long sequences of images
containing richer information not only in quantity but also in variety; (2)
motion and appearance information are usually correlated with each other and
able to provide useful attention cues to the other; (3) different questions
require different number of frames to infer the answer. Based these
observations, we propose a motion-appearance comemory network for video QA. Our
networks are built on concepts from Dynamic Memory Network (DMN) and introduces
new mechanisms for video QA. Specifically, there are three salient aspects: (1)
a co-memory attention mechanism that utilizes cues from both motion and
appearance to generate attention; (2) a temporal conv-deconv network to
generate multi-level contextual facts; (3) a dynamic fact ensemble method to
construct temporal representation dynamically for different questions. We
evaluate our method on TGIF-QA dataset, and the results outperform
state-of-the-art significantly on all four tasks of TGIF-QA.

views/scenes. In addition to accuracy, the matching efficiency has received
more and more attention because of demanding applications using large-scale
data. Several binary coding based methods have been proposed for efficient
ReID, which either learn projections to map high-dimensional features to
compact binary codes, or directly adopt deep neural networks by simply
inserting an additional fully-connected layer with tanh-like activations.
However, the former approach requires time-consuming hand-crafted feature
extraction and complicated (discrete) optimizations; the latter lacks the
necessary discriminative information greatly due to the straightforward
activation functions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
framework for efficient ReID inspired by the recent advances in adversarial
learning. Specifically, instead of learning explicit projections or adding
fully-connected mapping layers, the proposed Adversarial Binary Coding (ABC)
framework guides the extraction of binary codes implicitly and effectively. The
discriminability of the extracted codes is further enhanced by equipping the
ABC with a deep triplet network for the ReID task. More importantly, the ABC
and triplet network are simultaneously optimized in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments on three large-scale ReID benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods.

cataclysmic variables (CVs), focusing on scalings with orbital Mach number in
order to bridge the gap between numerical simulations and real systems. If an
inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) lies within the disk, ingoing waves are robustly
excited, and the angular-momentum flux they carry is independent of Mach
number. But in most CVs, the ILR lies outside the disk. The wave flux and its
scaling with Mach number are then very sensitive to conditions near the disk
edge. If the temperature and sound speed vanish there, excitation tends to be
exponentially suppressed. If the Mach number remains finite in the outer parts
but the radial and vertical density scale lengths become comparable due to
subkeplerian rotation, resonance can occur with acoustic-cutoff and
stratification frequencies. These previously neglected resonances excite waves,
but the Mach-number scaling remains very steep if the radial scale length
decreases gradually. The scaling can be less strong - algebraic rather than
exponential - if there are sharp changes in surface density at finite sound
speed. Shocks excited by streamline-crossing or by the impact of the stream
from the companion are unlikely to be important for the angular-momentum
budget, at least in quiescence. Our results may also apply to circumplanetary
disks, where Mach numbers are likely lower than in CVs.

And the final separation is acquired by post selecting the separating output

nanoscale ferromagnet to spin torque and microwave magnetic field. This novel
damping mechanism originates from three-magnon scattering that is strongly
enhanced by geometric confinement of magnons in the nanomagnet. We show that
the giant nonlinear damping can invert the effect of spin torque on a
nanomagnet leading to a surprising current-induced enhancement of damping by an
antidamping torque. Our work advances understanding of magnetic dynamics in
nanoscale ferromagnets and spin torque devices.

  Journal",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aabaea",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neutron star mergers (NSMs) eject energetic sub-relativistic dynamical ejecta
into the circumbinary media. As analogous to supernovae and supernova remnants,
the NSM dynamical ejecta are expected to produce non-thermal emission by
electrons accelerated at a shock wave. In this paper, we present expected radio
and X-ray signals by this mechanism, taking into account non-linear diffusive
shock acceleration (DSA) and magnetic field amplification. We suggest that the
NSM has a unique nature as a DSA site, where the seed relativistic electrons
are abundantly provided by the decays of r-process elements. The signal is
predicted to peak at a few 100 - 1,000 days after the merger, determined by the
balance between the decrease of the number of seed electrons and the increase
of the dissipated kinetic energy due to the shock expansion. While the
resulting flux can ideally reach to the maximum flux expected from
near-equipartition, the available kinetic energy dissipation rate of the NSM
ejecta limits the detectability of such a signal. It is likely that the radio
and X-ray emission are overwhelmed by other mechanisms (e.g., an off-axis jet)
for an observer placed to a jet direction (i.e., for GW170817). On the other
hand, for an off-axis observer, to be discovered once a number of NSMs are
identified, the dynamical ejecta component is predicted to dominate the
non-thermal emission. While the detection of this signal is challenging even
with near-future facilities, this potentially provides a robust probe of the
creation of r-process elements in NSMs.

convolutions to the 3D setting, they also have several considerable drawbacks.
The computational complexity of voxel-encodings grows cubically with the
resolution thus limiting such representations to low-resolution 3D
reconstruction. In an attempt to solve this problem, point cloud
representations have been proposed. Although point clouds are more efficient
than voxel representations as they only cover surfaces rather than volumes,
they do not encode detailed geometric information about relationships between
points. In this paper we propose a method to learn free-form deformations (FFD)

points sampled from a high-quality mesh, our trained model can be used to
produce arbitrarily dense point clouds or meshes with fine-grained geometry. We
evaluate our proposed framework on both synthetic and real-world data and

maintains the homomorphic obfuscation property for compressive sensing. In

strong correlation so that we design a MultiAttribute Assistance (MAA)

with MAA, the novel recovery scheme can provide reliable privacy with high

unity reflectivity for gravitational waves, readily detectable by Advanced
LIGO. In case reflectivity is much less than unity, the background will mainly
be arising from the first echo, with a level proportional to the power
reflectivity of the near-horizon structure, but robust against uncertainties in
the location of the structure --- as long as it is very close to the horizon.
Sensitivity of third-generation detectors allows the detection of a background
that corresponds to power reflectivity $\sim 10^{-3}$, if the uncertainties in
the binary black-hole merger rate can be removed. We note that the echoes do
alter the $f^{2/3}$ power law of the background spectra at low frequencies,
which is rather robust against the uncertainties.

driver of the world's most intense neutrino beam with high probability to
discover a neutrino CP violation. The physics performance of that neutrino
Super Beam in conjunction with a megaton underground Water Cherenkov neutrino
detector installed at a distance of about 500~km from ESS has been evaluated.
In addition, the choice of such detector will extent the physics program to
proton-decay and astrophysics searches. The ESS proton linac upgrades, the
accumulator ring needed for proton pulse compression, the target station, the
far detector and the physics potential are described. In addition to neutrinos,
this facility will also produce at the same time a copious number of muons

depleted electron density shown by PIC codes to be generated in collisionless
reconnection, can in principle become sources of X-mode Auroral Kilometric
Radiation generated by the electron cyclotron maser instability (ECMI). In this
paper it is suggested that under certain conditions such X-mode AKR can
possibly be transported down along the auroral magnetic flux tubes to low
altitudes, in extreme cases even penetrating below the ionospheric F- and
E-regions to reach ground level. The characteristic features of low-altitude
AKR produced and transported by this mechanism would be bandwidths of order
$\sim$100 kHz and occurrence in quasi-periodic bursts lasting $< 1$ s when
passing at full Alfv\'en speed, $>1$ s when retarded. Most published
observations of low-altitude AKR have insufficient time resolution to detect
these features, although a few are suggestive of them. The few observations
with marginally sufficient time resolution are so far neither consistent nor
inconsistent with these predictions, suggesting that occasions when electron
exhausts transport AKR all the way to low altitudes may be rare. However,
vigorous experimental effort to test these theoretical predictions is warranted
because of its physical and astrophysical significance. They would also provide
an additional method to remotely detect and investigate reconnection physics.

dimensionality of the tested system and the strong-coupling effects included in
the Eliashberg formalism.

variations and then use it to guide the synthesis of an intermediate frame
between two consecutive original frames. To handle challenges like occlusion,
bidirectional flow between the two input frames is often estimated and used to
warp and blend the input frames. However, how to effectively blend the two
warped frames still remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a
context-aware synthesis approach that warps not only the input frames but also
their pixel-wise contextual information and uses them to interpolate a
high-quality intermediate frame. Specifically, we first use a pre-trained
neural network to extract per-pixel contextual information for input frames. We
then employ a state-of-the-art optical flow algorithm to estimate bidirectional
flow between them and pre-warp both input frames and their context maps.
Finally, unlike common approaches that blend the pre-warped frames, our method
feeds them and their context maps to a video frame synthesis neural network to
produce the interpolated frame in a context-aware fashion. Our neural network
is fully convolutional and is trained end to end. Our experiments show that our
method can handle challenging scenarios such as occlusion and large motion and
outperforms representative state-of-the-art approaches.

find out that across the phase transitions from Z2 QSLs to different symmetry

the translational symmetry fractionalization of the latter, which can be served

impossible to meet later on, due to link or node failures, or excessive
degradation of their performance. In this paper, we focus on maintaining the
network functionality required by the applications after such events. We avoid
continuously recomputing the configuration centrally, by designing an energy
efficient local and distributed path reconfiguration method. Specifically,
given the operational parameters required by the applications, we provide
several algorithmic functions which locally reconfigure the data distribution
paths, when a communication link or a network node fails. We compare our method
through simulations to other state of the art methods and we demonstrate
performance gains in terms of energy consumption and data delivery success rate

measurement, the second is due to the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity.
The statistical uncertainty is negligible. Extrapolation to full phase space
yields the total inelastic proton-proton cross-section $\sigma_{\rm inel}= 75.4

Championships. This event, organised in every two years, has adopted four
hybrid formats consisting of knockout and round-robin stages in recent decades,
including a change of design between the two recent championships in 2017 and
2019. They are evaluated under two extremal seeding policies with respect to
various outcome measures through Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that the
ability to give the first four positions to the strongest teams, as well as the
expected quality and outcome uncertainty of the final is not necessarily a
monotonic function of the number of matches played: the most frugal format is
the second best with respect to these outcome measures, making it a good
compromise in an unavoidable trade-off. A possible error is identified in a
particular design. The relative performance of the formats is independent of
the seeding rules and the competitive balance of the teams. The recent reform
is demonstrated to have increased the probability of winning for the top teams.
Our results have useful implications for the organisers of hybrid tournaments.

twin-peak quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with periods of 23.82+-0.07 h and
71.44+-0.57 h. Using a Chandra observation of 2008, we evaluate more accurately
the position of the X-ray source and show that the new source coordinates
coincide with the position of the Seyfert 2 galaxy. We provide a detailed
spectral energy distribution of the AGN counterpart using multi-wavelength
observations. The AGN is radio-loud and the broadband SED modelling indicates a
black hole with a mass of 9.8x10^6 Msun, that accretes at an Eddington ratio of
0.047. QPOs for active galaxies have been reported so far in only few cases,
the most reliable one being from RE J1034+396 for which a 1 h periodicity has
been discovered analysing a ~91 ks XMM-Newton observation. Twin peak QPOs with
an observed frequency ratio of 3:1 have not been reported so far for any AGN.
From resonance models of the epicyclic frequencies we evaluate the different
possible mass-spin relations. It's still not clear what could have been the
origin of the high flux and sharp drop only observed in 2003.

  the Polynomial Chaos Expansion",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Uncertainties exist in both physics-based and data-driven models.
Variance-based sensitivity analysis characterizes how the variance of a model
output is propagated from the model inputs. The Sobol index is one of the most
widely used sensitivity indices for models with independent inputs. For models
with dependent inputs, different approaches have been explored to obtain
sensitivity indices in the literature. Typical approaches are based on
procedures of transforming the dependent inputs into independent inputs.
However, such transformation requires additional information about the inputs,
such as the dependency structure or the conditional probability density
functions. In this paper, data-driven sensitivity indices are proposed for
models with dependent inputs. We first construct ordered partitions of linearly
independent polynomials of the inputs. The modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm is
then applied to the ordered partitions to generate orthogonal polynomials with
respect to the empirical measure based on observed data of model inputs and
outputs. Using the polynomial chaos expansion with the orthogonal polynomials,
we obtain the proposed data-driven sensitivity indices. The sensitivity indices
provide intuitive interpretations of how the dependent inputs affect the
variance of the output without a priori knowledge on the dependence structure
of the inputs. Three numerical examples are used to validate the proposed
approach.

filaments in viscous flows underlie a wealth of biophysical processes from
flagellar propulsion to intracellular streaming, and are also key to
deciphering the rheological behavior of many complex fluids and soft materials.
Here, we combine experiments and computational modeling to elucidate the
dynamical regimes and morphological transitions of elastic Brownian filaments
in a simple shear flow. Actin filaments are employed as an experimental model
system and their conformations are investigated through fluorescence microscopy
in microfluidic channels. Simulations matching the experimental conditions are
also performed using inextensible Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and non-local
slender-body hydrodynamics in the presence of thermal fluctuations, and agree
quantitatively with observations. We demonstrate that filament dynamics in this
system is primarily governed by a dimensionless elasto-viscous number comparing
viscous drag forces to elastic bending forces, with thermal fluctuations only
playing a secondary role. While short and rigid filaments perform
quasi-periodic tumbling motions, a buckling instability arises above a critical
flow strength. A second transition to strongly-deformed shapes occurs at a yet
larger value of the elasto-viscous number and is characterized by the
appearance of localized high-curvature bends that propagate along the filaments
in apparent ""snaking"" motions. A theoretical model for the so far unexplored
onset of snaking accurately predicts the transition and explains the observed
dynamics. For the first time, we present a complete characterization of
filament morphologies and transitions as a function of elasto-viscous number
and scaled persistence length and demonstrate excellent agreement between
theory, experiments and simulations.

time computing convolutions. The Winograd family of algorithms can greatly

the worst case FP error and prove the estimation of norm and conditioning of

propose a canonical evaluation ordering based on Huffman coding that reduces
summation error. We study the selection of sampling ""points"" experimentally and
find empirically good points for the most important sizes. We identify the main
factors associated with good points. In addition, we explore other methods to
reduce FP error, including mixed-precision convolution, and pairwise summation
across DNN channels. Using our methods we can significantly reduce FP error for

behavior is presented. The underlying unperturbed model investigated is an
integrable, separable, 2 degrees of freedom mechanical impact system with
effectively bounded energy level sets and a single straight wall which
preserves the separable structure. Singularities in the system appear either as
trajectories with tangent impacts or as singularities in the underlying
Hamiltonian structure (e.g. separatrices). It is shown that away from these
singularities, a small perturbation from the integrable structure results in
smooth near integrable behavior. Such a perturbation may occur from a small
deformation or tilt of the wall which breaks the separability upon impact, the
addition of a small regular perturbation to the system, or the combination of
both. In some simple cases explicit formulae to the leading order term in the
near integrable return map are derived. Near integrability is also shown to
persist when the hard billiard boundary is replaced by a singular, smooth,
steep potential, thus extending the near-integrability results beyond the scope
of regular perturbations. These systems constitute an additional class of
examples of near integrable impact systems, beyond the traditional one
dimensional oscillating billiards, nearly elliptic billiards, and the
near-integrable behavior near the boundary of convex smooth billiards with or
without magnetic field.

  Model",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The effect of uncertainties and noise on a quantity of interest (model
output) is often better described by its probability density function (PDF)
than by its moments. Although density estimation is a common task, the adequacy
of approximation methods (surrogate models) for density estimation has not been
analyzed before in the uncertainty-quantification (UQ) literature. In this
paper, we first show that standard surrogate models (such as generalized
polynomial chaos), which are highly accurate for moment estimation, might
completely fail to approximate the PDF, even for one-dimensional noise. This is
because density estimation requires that the surrogate model accurately
approximates the gradient of the quantity of interest, and not just the
quantity of interest itself. Hence, we develop a novel spline-based algorithm
for density-estimation whose convergence rate in $L^q$ is polynomial in the
sampling resolution. This convergence rate is better than that of standard
statistical density-estimation methods (such as histograms and kernel density
estimators) at dimensions $1 \leq d\leq \frac{5}{2}m$, where $m$ is the spline
order. Furthermore, we obtain the convergence rate for density estimation with
any surrogate model that approximates the quantity of interest and its gradient
in $L^{\infty}$. Finally, we demonstrate our algorithm for problems in
nonlinear optics and fluid dynamics.

are addressed by investigating the impact of correlation, sparse sampling, and

Targeting for low complexity algorithms as well as small training overhead, a
compressive sensing (CS) approach is pursued. Unfortunately, due to the
Kronecker-type sensing (measurement) matrix corresponding to this setup,
application of standard CS algorithms and analysis methodology does not apply.
By recognizing that the channel possesses a special structure, termed
hierarchical sparsity, we propose an efficient algorithm that explicitly takes
into account this property. In addition, by extending the standard CS analysis
methodology to hierarchical sparse vectors, we provide a rigorous analysis of
the algorithm performance in terms of estimation error as well as number of
pilot subcarriers required to achieve it. Small training overhead, in turn,
means higher number of supported users in a cell and potentially improved pilot
decontamination. We believe, that this is the first paper that draws a rigorous
connection between the hierarchical framework and Kronecker measurements.
Numerical results verify the advantage of employing the proposed approach in
this setting instead of standard CS algorithms.

structure prediction and their other applications. However, distribution of
predicted angles would not be similar to that of real angles. To address this
we employed generative adversarial networks (GAN). Generative adversarial
networks are composed of two adversarially trained networks: a discriminator
and a generator. A discriminator distinguishes samples from a dataset and
generated samples while a generator generates realistic samples. Although the
discriminator of GANs is trained to estimate density, GAN model is intractable.
On the other hand, noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) was introduced to
estimate a normalization constant of an unnormalized statistical model and thus
the density function. In this thesis, we introduce noise-contrastive estimation
generative adversarial networks (NCE-GAN) which enables explicit density
estimation of a GAN model. And a new loss for the generator is proposed. We
also propose residue-wise variants of auxiliary classifier GAN (AC-GAN) and
Semi-supervised GAN to handle sequence information in a window. In our
experiment, the conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN), AC-GAN and
Semi-supervised GAN were compared. And experiments done with improved
conditions were invested. We identified a phenomenon of AC-GAN that
distribution of its predicted angles is composed of unusual clusters. The
distribution of the predicted angles of Semi-supervised GAN was most similar to
the Ramachandran plot. We found that adding the output of the NCE as an
additional input of the discriminator is helpful to stabilize the training of
the GANs and to capture the detailed structures. Adding regression loss and
using predicted angles by regression loss only model could improve the
conditional generation performance of the C-GAN and AC-GAN.

domains using Laguerre basis functions. Taking as model problem the scalar
advection equation, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis that includes
strong collocation formulations, nodal and modal weak formulations, with either
inflow or outflow boundary conditions, using either Gauss - Laguerre or Gauss -
Laguerre - Radau quadrature nodes and based on either scaled Laguerre functions
or scaled Laguerre polynomials. We show that some of these combinations give
rise to intrinsically unstable schemes, while the combination of scaled
Laguerre functions with Gauss - Laguerre - Radau nodes appears to be stable for
both strong and weak formulations. We then show how a modal discretization
approach for hyperbolic systems on an unbounded domain can be naturally and
seamlessly coupled to a discontinuous finite element discretization on a finite
domain. Examples of one dimensional hyperbolic systems are solved with the
proposed domain decomposition technique. The errors obtained with the proposed
approach are found to be small, enabling the use of the coupled scheme for the
simulation of Rayleigh damping layers in the semi-infinite part. Energy errors
and reflection ratios of the scheme in absorbing wavetrains and single Gaussian
signals show that a small number of nodes in the semi-infinite domain are
sufficient to damp the waves. The theoretical insight and numerical results
corroborate previous findings by the authors and establish the scaled Laguerre
functions-based discretization as a flexible and efficient tool for absorbing
layers as well as for the accurate simulation of waves in unbounded regions.

has become a popular method for Bayesian network inference in recent years. Its
application is vast, e.g. in neural network, compressed sensing, clustering,
etc. to name just a few. In this paper, the independence constraint in VB will
be relaxed to a conditional constraint class, called copula in statistics.
Since a joint probability distribution always belongs to a copula class, the
novel copula VB (CVB) approximation is a generalized form of VB. Via
information geometry, we will see that CVB algorithm iteratively projects the
original joint distribution to a copula constraint space until it reaches a
local minimum Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. By this way, all mean-field
approximations, e.g. iterative VB, Expectation-Maximization (EM), Iterated
Conditional Mode (ICM) and k-means algorithms, are special cases of CVB
approximation.
  For a generic Bayesian network, an augmented hierarchy form of CVB will also
be designed. While mean-field algorithms can only return a locally optimal
approximation for a correlated network, the augmented CVB network, which is an
optimally weighted average of a mixture of simpler network structures, can
potentially achieve the globally optimal approximation for the first time. Via
simulations of Gaussian mixture clustering, the classification's accuracy of
CVB will be shown to be far superior to that of state-of-the-art VB, EM and
k-means algorithms.

when the full network structure is known. However, resource constraints often
require decisions based on partial network data. We investigated how the
effectiveness of network-based vaccination schemes varied based on the accuracy
of network data available. Methods: We simulated propagating an SIR process on
static empirical social networks from 75 rural Indian villages. First, we used
regression analysis to predict the percentage of individuals ever infected
(cumulative incidence) based on village-level networks. Second, we simulated
vaccinating 10% of each village at baseline, selecting vaccinees using 1 of 5
network-based approaches: at random (Random); random contacts of random
individuals (Nomination); random high-degree individuals (High Degree); highest
degree (Highest Degree); or most central (Central). The first three approaches
require only sample data; the latter two require full network data. We also
simulated imposing a limit on how many contacts an individual can nominate
(Fixed Choice Design, FCD), which reduces data collection burden but generates
only partially observed networks. Results: We found the mean and standard
deviation of the degree distribution to strongly predict cumulative incidence.
In simulations, Nomination reduced cumulative incidence by one-sixth compared
to Random vaccination; full network methods reduced infection by two-thirds.
High Degree had intermediate effectiveness. Somewhat surprisingly, FCD
truncating individuals' degrees at three was as effective as using complete
networks. Conclusions: Using even partial network information to prioritize
vaccines at either the village or individual level substantially improved
epidemic outcomes. Such approaches may be feasible and effective in outbreak
settings, and full ascertainment of network structure may not be required.

to an extension of the notion of compatibility for measurements. We consider
the simulation of observables within the operational framework of general

While a simulation irreducible observable can only be simulated by itself, we
show that any observable can be simulated by simulation irreducible
observables, which in the quantum case correspond to extreme rank-1
positive-operator-valued measures. We also consider cases where the set of
simulators is restricted in one of two ways: in terms of either the number of
simulating observables or their number of outcomes. The former is seen to be
closely connected to compatibility and $k$-compatibility, whereas the latter
leads to a partial characterization for dichotomic observables. In addition to
the quantum case, we further demonstrate these concepts in state spaces

emerging wireless technologies due to their autonomy and wide range of
applications. Yet, the limited energy resources of battery-powered sensor nodes
is a top constraint, especially in single-hop topologies, where nodes located
far from the base station must conduct uplink (UL) communications in high power
levels. On this point, multi-hop routings in the UL are starting to gain
attention due to their capability of reducing energy consumption by enabling
transmissions to closer hops. Nonetheless, a priori identifying energy
efficient multi-hop routings is not trivial due to the unpredictable factors
affecting the communication links in large LPWAN areas. In this paper, we
propose epsilon multi-hop (EMH), a simple reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
based on epsilon-greedy to enable reliable and low consumption LPWAN multi-hop
topologies. Results from a real testbed show that multi-hop topologies based on
EMH achieve significant energy savings with respect to the default single-hop

cloud practices, like migration of VMs between physical platforms. For
instance, the SGX trusted execution environment (enclave) is bound to a single

  Although prior work has proposed an effective mechanism to migrate an
enclave's data memory, it overlooks the migration of persistent state,
including sealed data and monotonic counters; the former risks data loss whilst
the latter undermines the SGX security guarantees. We show how this can be
exploited to mount attacks, and then propose an improved enclave migration
approach guaranteeing the consistency of persistent state. Our software-only

hydrocarbons (PAHs) is widely believed as an origin of anomalous microwave
emission (AME), but recently it encounters a setback due to the non-correlation
of AME with PAH abundance seen in a full-sky analysis. Microwave observations
for specific regions with well-constrained PAH features would be crucial to
test the spinning dust hypothesis. In this paper, we present physical modeling
of microwave emission from spinning PAHs from protoplanetary disks (PPDs)
around Herbig Ae/Be stars and T-Tauri stars where PAH features are well
observed. Guided by the presence of 10 $\mu$m silicate features in some PPDs,
we also model microwave emission from spinning nanosilicates. Thermal emission
from big dust grains is computed using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code.
Our numerical results demonstrate that microwave emission from either spinning
PAHs or spinning nanosilicates dominates over thermal dust at frequencies $\nu<
60$ GHz, even in the presence of significant grain growth. Finally, we attempt
to fit mm-cm observational data with both thermal dust and spinning dust for
several disks around Herbig Ae/Be stars that exhibit PAH features and find that
spinning dust can successfully reproduce the observed excess microwave emission
(EME). Future radio observations with ngVLA, SKA and ALMA Band 1 would be
valuable for elucidating the origin of EME and potentially open a new window

which there are huge other hosts contact. It plays important roles in network

high-speed network which contains several distributed routers is a hard task.
Distributed sliding super point detection requires an algorithm that can
estimate the number of contacting hosts incrementally, scan packets faster than
their flowing speed and reconstruct sliding super point at the end of a time
period. But no existing algorithm satisfies these three requirements
simultaneously. To solve this problem, this paper firstly proposed a
distributed sliding super point detection algorithm running on GPU. The
advantage of this algorithm comes from a novel sliding estimator, which can
estimate contacting host number incrementally under a sliding window, and a set
of reversible hash functions, by which sliding super points could be regained
without storing additional data such as IP list. There are two main procedures
in this algorithm: packets scanning and sliding super points reconstruction.
Both could run parallel without any data reading conflict. When deployed on a
low cost GPU, this algorithm could deal with traffic with bandwidth as high as

of this sliding super point detection algorithm on a cheap GPU, Nvidia GTX950

being the many-body Lieb-Liniger eigenstates. We show that even in the limit of
vanishing interaction the yrast states possess features typical for solitons,
like the phase jumps and the density notches. These properties are simply
effects of the bosonic symmetrization and are encoded in the Dicke states
hidden in the yrast states.

functional theory calculations. Strong-field adiabatic ionization of 3- and
4-nitrotoluene using 1500 nm, 18 fs pulses produces radical cations in the
ground electronic state with distinct coherent vibrational excitations. In both
nitrotoluene isomers, a one-photon excitation with the probe pulse results in
\ce{NO2} loss to form \ce{C7H7+}, which exhibits out-of-phase oscillations in
yield with the parent molecular ion. The oscillations in 4-nitrotoluene with a
period of 470 fs are attributed to the torsional motion of the \ce{NO2} group
based on theoretical results showing that the dominant relaxation pathway in
4-nitrotoluene radical cation involves the rotation of the \ce{NO2} group away
from the planar geometry. The distinctly faster oscillation period of 216 fs in
3-nitrotoluene is attributed to an in-plane bending motion of the \ce{NO2} and
\ce{CH3} moieties based on analysis of the normal modes. These results
demonstrate that coherent nuclear motions determine the probability of
\ce{C-NO2} homolysis in the nitrotoluene radical cations upon optical
excitation within several hundred femtoseconds of the initial ionization event.

This background knowledge is often obtained by allowing the clustering system
to pose pairwise queries to the user: should these two elements be in the same
cluster or not? Active clustering methods aim to minimize the number of queries
needed to obtain a good clustering by querying the most informative pairs
first. Ideally, a user should be able to answer a couple of these queries,
inspect the resulting clustering, and repeat these two steps until a
satisfactory result is obtained. We present COBRAS, an approach to active
clustering with pairwise constraints that is suited for such an interactive
clustering process. A core concept in COBRAS is that of a super-instance: a
local region in the data in which all instances are assumed to belong to the
same cluster. COBRAS constructs such super-instances in a top-down manner to
produce high-quality results early on in the clustering process, and keeps
refining these super-instances as more pairwise queries are given to get more
detailed clusterings later on. We experimentally demonstrate that COBRAS
produces good clusterings at fast run times, making it an excellent candidate

standard technique for probing CEF excitations in lanthanides is inelastic
neutron scattering. Here we show that with the recent leap in energy
resolution, resonant inelastic soft X-ray scattering has become a serious
alternative for looking at CEF excitations with some distinct advantages
compared to INS. As an example we study the CEF scheme in CeRh2Si2, a system
that has been intensely studied for more than two decades now but for which no
consensus has been reached yet as to its CEF scheme. We used two new features
that have only become available very recently in RIXS, high energy resolution
of about 30 meV as well as polarization analysis in the scattered beam, to find
a unique CEF description for CeRh2Si2. The result agrees well with previous INS
and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Due to its strong resonant character,
RIXS is applicable to very small samples, presents very high cross sections for
all lanthanides, and further benefits from the very weak coupling to phonon
excitation. The rapid progress in energy resolution of RIXS spectrometers is
making this technique increasingly attractive for the investigation of the CEF

gauge theory on a finite spatial lattice in the Hamiltonian approach. We build
on previous work where we have implemented the classical gauge orbit strata on
quantum level within a suitable holomorphic picture. In this picture, each
element $\tau$ of the classical stratification corresponds to the zero locus of
a finite subset $\{p_i\}$ of the algebra $\mathcal R$ of $G$-invariant
representative functions on the complexification of $G^N$. Viewing the
invariants as multiplication operators $\hat p_i$ on the Hilbert space
$\mathcal H$, the union of their images defines a subspace of $\mathcal H$
whose orthogonal complement $\mathcal H_\tau$ is the element of the
costratification corresponding to $\tau$. To construct $\mathcal H_\tau$, one
has to determine the images of the $\hat p_i$ explicitly. To accomplish that
goal, we construct an orthonormal basis in $\mathcal H$ and determine the
multiplication law for the basis elements, that is, we determine the structure
constants of $\mathcal R$ in this basis. This part of our analysis applies to
any compact Lie group $G$. For $G = \mathrm{SU}(2)$, the above procedure boils
down to a problem in combinatorics of angular momentum theory. Using this
theory, we obtain the union of the images of the operators $\hat p_i$ as a
subspace generated by vectors whose coefficients with respect to our basis are
given in terms of Wigner's $3nj$ symbols. The latter are further expressed in
terms of $9j$ symbols. Using these techniques, we are also able to reduce the
eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian of this theory to a problem in linear
algebra.

precise frameworks with great potential in image segmentation. One of the major
challenges in training such networks raises when data is unbalanced, which is
common in many medical imaging applications such as lesion segmentation where
lesion class voxels are often much lower in numbers than non-lesion voxels. A
trained network with unbalanced data may make predictions with high precision
and low recall, being severely biased towards the non-lesion class which is
particularly undesired in most medical applications where FNs are more
important than FPs. Various methods have been proposed to address this problem,
more recently similarity loss functions and focal loss. In this work we trained
fully convolutional deep neural networks using an asymmetric similarity loss
function to mitigate the issue of data imbalance and achieve much better
tradeoff between precision and recall. To this end, we developed a 3D
FC-DenseNet with large overlapping image patches as input and an asymmetric
similarity loss layer based on Tversky index (using Fbeta scores). We used
large overlapping image patches as inputs for intrinsic and extrinsic data
augmentation, a patch selection algorithm, and a patch prediction fusion
strategy using B-spline weighted soft voting to account for the uncertainty of
prediction in patch borders. We applied this method to MS lesion segmentation
based on two different datasets of MSSEG and ISBI longitudinal MS lesion
segmentation challenge, where we achieved top performance in both challenges.
Our network trained with focal loss ranked first according to the ISBI
challenge overall score and resulted in the lowest reported lesion false
positive rate among all submitted methods. Our network trained with the
asymmetric similarity loss led to the lowest surface distance and the best
lesion true positive rate.

we propose is based on the observation that our desire to grant the freedom of
natural head movement to the user requires 3D modeling of the scene set-up.
Although, using a single low resolution web camera bounds us in dimensions (no
depth can be recovered), we propose ways to cope with this drawback and model
the scene in front of the user. We tackle this three-dimensional problem by
realizing that it can be viewed as series of two-dimensional special cases.
Then, we propose a procedure that treats each movement of the user's head as a
special two-dimensional case, hence reducing the complexity of the problem back
to two dimensions. Furthermore, the proposed tracker is calibration free and
discards this tedious part of all previously mentioned trackers.
  Experimental results show that the proposed tracker achieves good results,
given the restrictions on it. We can report that the tracker commits a mean
error of (56.95, 70.82) pixels in x and y direction, respectively, when the
user's head is as static as possible (no chin-rests are used). Furthermore, we
can report that the proposed tracker commits a mean error of (87.18, 103.86)

  Supervision","CVPR 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Face anti-spoofing is the crucial step to prevent face recognition systems
from a security breach. Previous deep learning approaches formulate face
anti-spoofing as a binary classification problem. Many of them struggle to
grasp adequate spoofing cues and generalize poorly. In this paper, we argue the
importance of auxiliary supervision to guide the learning toward discriminative
and generalizable cues. A CNN-RNN model is learned to estimate the face depth
with pixel-wise supervision, and to estimate rPPG signals with sequence-wise
supervision. Then we fuse the estimated depth and rPPG to distinguish live vs.
spoof faces. In addition, we introduce a new face anti-spoofing database that
covers a large range of illumination, subject, and pose variations.
Experimental results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on both intra-database and cross-database testing.

present a systematic analysis of the accuracy of the ab initio estimation of
muon's hyperfine contact field on elemental transition metals, performing state
of the art spin-polarized plane wave DFT and using the projector augmented
pseudopotential approach, which allows to include the core state effects due to
the spin ordering. We further validate this method in not-so-simple,
non-centrosymmetric metallic compounds, presently of topical interest for their
spiral magnetic structure giving rise to skyrmion phases, such as MnSi and
MnGe. The calculated hyperfine fields agree with experimental values in all
cases, provided the spontaneous spin magnetization of the metal is well
reproduced within the approach. To overcome the known limits of the
conventional mean field approximation of DFT on itinerant magnets, we adopt the
so-called reduced Stoner theory [L. Ortenzi et al.,Phys. Rev. B 86, 064437

growing number of players. The main performance metrics of this application on
the network level are packet ordering, communication throughput and
transmission latency. Nowadays there is an interest in cyclic logical network
topologies for online gaming, due to the easiness to preserve the packet order
over cycles.Unfortunately, this approach increases the end-to-end transmission
delays. In our paper, two main contributions are therefore presented. Firstly,
it is shown that one can improve the latency of a gaming protocol over a
single-cycle topology by the network coding (NC) approach. The corresponding
NC-based routing protocol has been designed and analysed; it outperforms the
best routing protocol without NC. Secondly, from the NC viewpoint, the example
of online gaming is not a trivial one, given that the corresponding
communication protocol is not multicast. Therefore, it is shown that there
exists a NC gain (namely, up to 14% in transmission latency) even in case of a
mixed communication protocol with broadcast and unicast transmission flows.

creating rules from datasets of transactions of items. Most methods identify
items likely to appear together in a transaction based on the support (i.e. a
minimum number of relative co-occurrence of the items) for that hypothesis.
Although this is a good indicator to measure the relevance of the assumption
that these items are likely to appear together, the phenomenon of very frequent
items, referred to as ubiquitous items, is not addressed in most algorithms.
Ubiquitous items have the same entropy as infrequent items, and not
contributing significantly to the knowledge. On the other hand, they have
strong effect on the performance of the algorithms and sometimes preventing the
convergence of the FIM algorithms and thus the provision of meaningful results.
This paper discusses the phenomenon of ubiquitous items and demonstrates how
ignoring these has a dramatic effect on the computation performances but with a
low and controlled effect on the significance of the results.

a bursty transmission mode can be energy-efficient to achieve steady

distinctively different from existing studies under ideal circuits and PAs,
where continuous transmissions are the most energy-efficient. Another important
contribution is that the optimal transmit duration and powers are identified to
balance energy consumptions in the non-ideal circuits and PAs, and maximize the
EE. This is achieved by establishing the most energy-efficient structure of
transmit powers, given a transmit duration, and correspondingly partitioning
the non-convex feasible region of the transmit duration into segments with
self-contained convexity or concavity. Evident from simulations, significant EE
gains of the proposed approach are demonstrated through comparisons with the

the results of these calculations vary with the value of the range-separation
parameter (Rlc = 1/{\mu}) for a model organic solar cell heterojunction
consisting of a van der Waals complex P/F made up of single pentacene (P)
molecule together with a single buckminsterfullerene (F) molecule. The default
value of Rlc = 3.03 a0 is found to be much too small as neither energy nor
charge transfer is observed until Rlc ~ 10 a0. Tests at a single geometry show
that best agreement with high-quality ab-initio spectra is obtained in the
limit of no lc (i.e., very large Rlc.) A plot of energy and charge transfer
rates as a function of Rlc is provided which suggests that a value of Rlc ~ 15
a0 yields the typical literature charge transfer time of about 100 fs. However,
energy and charge transfer times become as high as ~ 300 fs for Rlc ~ 25 a0. A
closer examination of the charge transfer process P*/F to P+/F- shows that the
initial electron transfer is accompanied by a partial delocalization of the P
hole onto F which then relocalizes back onto P, consistent with a polaron-like

compile a chromospheric activity catalogue of 4454 cool stars from a
combination of archival HARPS spectra and multiple other surveys, including the
Mount Wilson data that have recently been released by the NSO. We explore the
variation in chromospheric activity of cool stars along the main sequence for
stars with different effective temperatures. Additionally, we also perform an
activity-cycle period search and investigate its relation with rotation. The
chromospheric activity index, S-index, was measured for 304 main-sequence stars
from archived high-resolution HARPS spectra. Additionally, the measured and
archived S-indices were converted into the chromospheric flux ratio log R'HK.
The activity-cycle periods were determined using the generalised Lomb-Scargle
periodogram to study the active and inactive branches on the
rotation-activity-cycle period plane. The global sample shows that the
bimodality of chromospheric activity, known as the Vaughan-Preston gap, is not
prominent, with a significant percentage of the stars at an
intermediate-activity level around log R'HK = -4.75. Independently, the cycle
period search shows that stars can lie in the region intermediate between the
active and inactive branch, which means that the active branch is not as
clearly distinct as previously thought. The weakening of the Vaughan-Preston
gap indicates that cool stars spin down from a higher activity level and settle
at a lower activity level without a sudden break at intermediate activity. Some
cycle periods are close to the solar value between the active and inactive
branch, which suggests that the solar dynamo is most likely a common case of
the stellar dynamo.

three ways by particle physics. First, particle physics deflects Schlick's
General Relativity-based critique of synthetic a priori knowledge. Schlick
argued that since geometry was not synthetic a priori, nothing was---a key step
toward logical empiricism. Particle physics suggests a Kant-friendlier theory
of space-time and gravity presumably approximating General Relativity
arbitrarily well, massive spin-2 gravity, while retaining a flat space-time
geometry that is_indirectly_ observable at large distances. The theory's roots
include Seeliger and Neumann in the 1890s and Einstein in 1917 as well as
1920s-30s physics. Such theories have seen renewed scientific attention since
2000 and especially since 2010 due to breakthroughs addressing early 1970s
technical difficulties. Second, particle physics casts additional doubt on
Friedman's constitutive \emph{a priori} role for the principle of equivalence.
Massive spin-2 gravity presumably should have nearly the same empirical content
as General Relativity while differing radically on foundational issues.
Empirical content even in General Relativity resides in partial differential
equations, not in an additional principle identifying gravity and inertia.
Third, Kant's apparent claim that Newton's results could be known a priori is
undermined by an alternate gravitational equation. The modified theory has a
smaller (Galilean) symmetry group than does Newton's. What Kant wanted from
Newton's gravity is impossible due its large symmetry group, but is closer to
achievable given the alternative theory.

algorithm for linear system models. Its performance is characterized by the
state evolution (SE) which is a simple scalar recursion. However, depending on
a measurement matrix ensemble, AMP may face a convergence problem. To avoid
this problem, orthogonal AMP (OAMP), which uses de-correlation linear
estimation and divergence-free non-linear estimation, was proposed by Ma and
Ping. They also provide the SE analysis for OAMP. In their SE analysis, the
following two assumptions were made: (i) The estimated vector of the
de-correlation linear estimator consists of i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian entries
independent of the vector to be estimated and (ii) the estimated vector of the
divergence-free non-linear estimator consists of i.i.d. entries independent of
the measurement matrix and the noise vector. In this paper, we derive a simple

transformation strains accommodation. Microcracks formation is observed,
explaining grain pop-out where the crystallographic disorientation between two

engineering processes. It can be harnessed through a process known as ice
templating, to produce porous materials and composites exhibiting unique
functional properties. The phenomenon by itself appears simple: a
solidification interface propagates through a colloidal suspension. We are
nevertheless still far from a complete understanding and control of the
phenomenon. Such lack of control is reflected in the very large scattering of
mechanical properties reported for ice-templated ceramics, largely due to the
formation of structural defects. Through systematic in situ investigations, we
demonstrate here the role of the suspension composition and the role of
particle-particle electrostatic interactions on defect formation during ice
templating. Flocculation can occur in the intercrystal space, leading to a
destabilisation of the solid/liquid interface triggering the growth of crystals
perpendicular to the main ice growth direction. This mechanism largely
contributes to the formation of structural defects and explains, to a large
extent, the scattering of compressive strength values reported in the
literature.

X-rays radiography and tomography. We focus here on the formation and structure
of the transitional zone, which takes place during the initials instants of
freezing. For many applications, this part is undesirable since the resulting
porosity is heterogeneous, in size, morphology and orientation. We investigate
the influence of the composition of alumina suspensions on the formation of the
transitional zone. Alumina particles are dispersed by three different
dispersants, in various quantities, or by chlorhydric acid. We show that the
height and the morphology of the transitional zone are determined by the growth
of large dendritic ice-crystals growing in a supercooled state, and growing
much faster than the cellular freezing front. When the freezing temperature
decreases, the degree of supercooling increases. This results in a faster
freezing front velocity and increases the dimensions of the transitional zone.
It is therefore possible to adjust the dimensions of the transitional zone by
changing the composition of alumina suspensions. The counter-ion Na+ has the
most dramatic influence on the freezing temperature of suspensions, yielding a
predominance of cellular ice crystals instead of the usual lamellar crystals.

(cryo-FEGSEM) to investigate the stability of alumina suspensions. The
stability is investigated through viscosity, zeta potential, total organic
carbon measurements and cryo-FEGSEM observations. We focus on two examples: the
effect of the quantity of ammonium polyacrylate as dispersant and the effect of
its chain length on alumina particles dispersion with a solid content of
32vol%. In the first example for some suspensions we measure values of
viscosity or zeta potential too similar to discriminate the best state of
dispersion. To overcome this problem we directly observe the suspensions with
Cryo-FEGSEM. We take advantage of the recent developments of the technique,
which provide now extremely high cooling rates and ensure that the freezing
step does not induce observations artifacts related to the formation of ice.
This technique provides an accurate vision of particles dispersion,
agglomeration in ceramic suspensions and it is possible to visualize the excess
of dispersant. In the second example the longer dispersant appears to be the
more effective to obtain the best state of dispersion. Through both examples,
we demonstrate that to have the best interpretation of results it is useful to
combine direct observations by Cryo-FEGSEM and the usual properties
measurements.

accelerations. In this work, to address the increasing demands in computational
capability and memory requirement, we propose structured weight matrices
(SWM)-based compression techniques for both \emph{field programmable gate
array} (FPGA) and \emph{application-specific integrated circuit} (ASIC)
implementations. In algorithm part, SWM-based framework adopts block-circulant
matrices to achieve a fine-grained tradeoff between accuracy and compression
ratio. The SWM-based technique can reduce computational complexity from
O($n^2$) to O($n\log n$) and storage complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) for
each layer and both training and inference phases. For FPGA implementations on
deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), we achieve at least 152X and 72X
improvement in performance and energy efficiency, respectively using the
SWM-based framework, compared with the baseline of IBM TrueNorth processor
under same accuracy constraints using the data set of MNIST, SVHN, and
CIFAR-10. For FPGA implementations on long short term memory (LSTM) networks,
the proposed SWM-based LSTM can achieve up to 21X enhancement in performance
and 33.5X gains in energy efficiency compared with the baseline accelerator.
For ASIC implementations, the SWM-based ASIC design exhibits impressive
advantages in terms of power, throughput, and energy efficiency. Experimental
results indicate that this method is greatly suitable for applying DNNs onto
both FPGAs and mobile/IoT devices.

directional solidification is investigated here by in situ observations using

influence of particle size on the solidification behaviour of the suspensions
during the early stages of solidification. Four powders with particle size in
the range 0.2-3.4{\mu}m (median size) were investigated. Solidification is
obtained by cooling at a constant rate, starting from room temperature.
Attention is specifically paid to the nucleation and growth behaviour of the
ice crystals in these suspensions. We propose that the nucleation of ice
crystals is controlled by the particle size, the surface of the particles
acting as nucleation sites. Smaller particle size leads to a lower degree of
supercooling since nucleation and growth can proceed at higher temperature than
with larger particles. The initial interface velocity is dependent on the
degree of supercooling, and controls the extent of the initial structural
gradient in the resulting porous materials.

Yet, it is still a puzzling phenomenon with many unexplained features, due to
the complexity of the system and the space and time scales at which the process
should be investigated. We demonstrate here the interest of fast X-ray computed
tomography to provide time-lapse, three-dimensional, in situ imaging of ice
crystal growth in a colloidal silica suspension. The experimental measurements
show that the local increase of colloid concentration does not affect the
growth kinetics of the crystals, until the colloidal particles become closely
packed. For particles much smaller than ice crystals, the concentrated
colloidal suspension is equivalent to a simple liquid phase with higher
viscosity and a freezing point determined by the concentration of colloidal
particles.
