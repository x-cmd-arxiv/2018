  proper subset of class NP","17 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.CC math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper solves a long standing open problem of whether NP-complete
problems could be solved in polynomial time on a deterministic Turing machine
by showing that the indistinguishable binomial decision tree can be formed in a
3-SAT instance. This paper describes how to construct the decision tree and
explains why 3-SAT has no polynomial-time algorithm when the decision tree is
formed in the 3-SAT instance. The indistinguishable binomial decision tree
consists of polynomial numbers of nodes containing an indistinguishable
variable pair but generates exponentially many paths connecting the clauses to
be used for sequences of resolution steps. The number of paths starting from
the root node and arriving at a child node forms a binomial coefficient. In
addition, each path has an indistinguishable property from one another. Due to
the exponential number of paths and their indistinguishability, if an
indistinguishable binomial decision tree is constructed in which there exist
one or more paths generating an empty clause, the number of calculation steps
needed to extract the empty clause is not polynomially bounded. This result
leads to the conclusion that class P is a proper subset of class NP.

book chapter reviews runtime analyses that have shown benefits of population
diversity, either through explicit diversity mechanisms or through naturally
emerging diversity. These works show that the benefits of diversity are
manifold: diversity is important for global exploration and the ability to find
several global optima. Diversity enhances crossover and enables crossover to be
more effective than mutation. Diversity can be crucial in dynamic optimization,
when the problem landscape changes over time. And, finally, it facilitates
search for the whole Pareto front in evolutionary multiobjective optimization.
The presented analyses rigorously quantify the performance of evolutionary

rigorous understanding of how search dynamics are affected by the presence or

represent the distances-to-default of financial institutions and absorption at
zero corresponds to default. As a way of modelling correlated exposures and
herd behaviour, we consider a common source of noise and a form of
mean-reversion in the drift. Moreover, we introduce an endogenous contagion
mechanism whereby the default of one institution can cause a drop in the
distances-to-default of the other institutions. In this way, we aim to capture
key `system-wide' effects on risk. The resulting mean field limit is
characterized uniquely by a nonlinear SPDE on the half-line with a Dirichlet
boundary condition. The density of this SPDE gives the conditional law of a
non-standard `conditional' McKean--Vlasov diffusion, for which we provide a
novel upper Dirichlet heat kernel type estimate that is essential to the
proofs. Depending on the realizations of the common noise and the rate of mean
reversion, the SPDE can exhibit rapid accelerations in the loss of mass at the
boundary. In other words, the contagion mechanism can give rise to periods of
significant systemic default clustering.

in Spitale and Porco (2007), the updated set of jets proposed in Porco et al.
(2014), and a contrasting curtain-style plume proposed in Spitale et al.
(2015). Methods for computing the surface deposition are detailed, and the
structure of surface deposition patterns is shown to be consistent across
changes in the production rate and size distribution of the plume. Maps are
also provided of the surface deposition structure originating in each of the
four Tiger Stripes. Finally, the differing approaches used in Porco et al.
(2014) and Spitale et al. (2015) have given rise to a jets vs. curtains
controversy regarding the emission structure of the Enceladus plume. Here we
simulate each, leading to new insight that, over time, most emissions must be
directed relatively orthogonal to the surface because jets ""tilted""
significantly away from orthogonal lead to surface deposition patterns
inconsistent with surface images.

develop an initial reaction set using Burke et al. [2012], Burke et al. [2013],
Sellevag et al. [2009], and Konnov [2015]; test it for thermodynamic and
kinetics consistency and plausibility against other sets in the literature;
assign estimated uncertainties where not stated in the sources; select key data

respect to Arrhenius pre-exponential factors; develop surrogate models for the
model-predicted QOI values; evaluate model-vs.-data consistency using
Bound-to-Bound Data Collaboration; and optimize model parameters within their
estimated uncertainty bounds (feasible set). Necessary data and software for
such analyses were developed and are publicly available through the PrIMe
cyberinfrastructure. This community workflow proved to be a means to reveal
inconsistencies, improvements, and uncertainty bounds. Even more significantly,
it is a means of revealing which parameters and experimental findings are
inconsistent with the larger body of work from the community and, thus, of

and (b) it always translates the reviewer embedding to the embedding of the
reviewed items. This allows TransRev to approximate a review embedding at test

The approximated review embedding is then used with the regression model to
predict the review score for each item. TransRev outperforms state of the art
recommender systems on a large number of benchmark data sets. Moreover, it is
able to retrieve, for each user and item, the review text from the training set

surprise many. This is particularly important for the elections in which
results affect the economy of a sizable population. A better prediction of the
true outcome helps reduce the surprise and keeps the voters prepared. This
paper starts from the basic observation that individuals in the underlying
population build estimates of the distribution of preferences of the whole
population based on their local neighborhoods. The outcome of the election
leads to a surprise if these local estimates contradict the outcome of the
election for some fixed voting rule. To get a quantitative understanding, we
propose a simple mathematical model of the setting where the individuals in the
population and their connections (through geographical proximity, social
networks etc.) are described by a random graph with connection probabilities
that are biased based on the preferences of the individuals. Each individual
also has some estimate of the bias in their connections.
  We show that the election outcome leads to a surprise if the discrepancy
between the estimated bias and the true bias in the local connections exceeds a
certain threshold, and confirm the phenomenon that surprising outcomes are
associated only with {\em closely contested elections}. We compare standard
voting rules based on their performance on surprise and show that they have
different behavior for different parts of the population. It also hints at an
impossibility that a single voting rule will be less surprising for {\em all}
parts of a population. Finally, we experiment with the UK-EU referendum

variants of sign languages to communicate, thus the automatic translation of a
sign language is meaningful and important. Currently, there are two
sub-problems in Sign Language Recognition (SLR), i.e., isolated SLR that
recognizes word by word and continuous SLR that translates entire sentences.
Existing continuous SLR methods typically utilize isolated SLRs as building
blocks, with an extra layer of preprocessing (temporal segmentation) and
another layer of post-processing (sentence synthesis). Unfortunately, temporal
segmentation itself is non-trivial and inevitably propagates errors into
subsequent steps. Worse still, isolated SLR methods typically require strenuous
labeling of each word separately in a sentence, severely limiting the amount of
attainable training data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
continuous sign recognition framework, the Hierarchical Attention Network with
Latent Space (LS-HAN), which eliminates the preprocessing of temporal
segmentation. The proposed LS-HAN consists of three components: a two-stream
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for video feature representation generation,
a Latent Space (LS) for semantic gap bridging, and a Hierarchical Attention
Network (HAN) for latent space based recognition. Experiments are carried out
on two large scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness

its knowledge. We introduce two metrics to quantify forgetting and
intransigence that allow us to understand, analyse, and gain better insights
into the behaviour of IL algorithms. We present RWalk, a generalization of
EWC++ (our efficient version of EWC [Kirkpatrick2016EWC]) and Path Integral
[Zenke2017Continual] with a theoretically grounded KL-divergence based
perspective. We provide a thorough analysis of various IL algorithms on MNIST
and CIFAR-100 datasets. In these experiments, RWalk obtains superior results in
terms of accuracy, and also provides a better trade-off between forgetting and
intransigence.

already shown that quantum effect could indeed bring quantum advantages, a
global and deeper understanding is still lacking. Here, we extend previous
models of autonomous machines to include quantum batteries made of arbitrary
systems of discrete spectrum. We establish their actual efficiency, which
allows us to derive an efficiency upper bound, called maximal achievable
efficiency, shown to be always achievable, in contrast with previous upper
bounds based only on the Second Law. Such maximal achievable efficiency can be
expressed simply in term of the it apparent temperature of the quantum battery.
This important result appears to be a powerful tool to understand how quantum

element trajectories. This implies that the spatial distribution of
non-interacting noninertial particles in such flows cannot develop density
inhomogeneities beyond those that are already introduced in the initial
condition. However, in certain practical situations, density is measured or
accumulated on (hyper-) surfaces of dimensionality lower than the full
dimensionality of the flow in which the particles move. An example is the
observation of particle distributions sedimented on the floor of the ocean. In
such cases, even if the initial distribution of noninertial particles is
uniform within a finite support in an incompressible flow, advection in the
flow will give rise to inhomogeneities in the observed density. In this paper
we analytically derive, in the framework of an initially homogeneous particle
sheet sedimenting towards a bottom surface, the relationship between the
geometry of the flow and the emerging distribution. From a physical point of
view, we identify the two processes that generate inhomogeneities to be the
stretching within the sheet, and the projection of the deformed sheet onto the
target surface. We point out that an extreme form of inhomogeneity, caustics,
can develop for sheets. We exemplify our geometrical results with simulations
of particle advection in a simple kinematic flow, study the dependence on
various parameters involved, and illustrate that the basic mechanisms work
similarly if the initial (homogeneous) distribution occupies a more general
region of finite extension rather than a sheet.

and topology. Its core structures are discrete gradient fields, defined as
acyclic matchings on a complex $C$, from which topological and geometrical
informations of $C$ can be efficiently computed, in particular its homology or
Morse-Smale decomposition.
  Given a function $f$ sampled on $C$, it is possible to derive a discrete
gradient that mimics the dynamics of $f$. Many such constructions are based on
some variant of a greedy pairing of adjacent cells, given an appropriate
weighting. However, proving that the dynamics of $f$ is correctly captured by
this process is usually intricate.
  This work introduces the notion of discrete smoothness of the pair $(f,C)$,
as a minimal sampling condition to ensure that the discrete gradient is
geometrically faithful to $f$. More precisely, a discrete gradient construction
from a function $f$ on a polyhedron complex $C$ of any dimension is studied,
leading to theoretical guarantees prior to the discrete smoothness assumption.
Those results are then extended and completed for the smooth case. As an
application, a purely combinatorial proof that all CAT(0) cube complexes are

factual descriptions about the content of a given image. However, for human
beings, image caption writing is quite flexible and diverse, where additional
language dimensions, such as emotion, humor and language styles, are often
incorporated to produce diverse, emotional, or appealing captions. In
particular, we are interested in generating sentiment-conveying image
descriptions, which has received little attention. The main challenge is how to
effectively inject sentiments into the generated captions without altering the
semantic matching between the visual content and the generated descriptions. In
this work, we propose two different models, which employ different schemes for
injecting sentiments into image captions. Compared with the few existing
approaches, the proposed models are much simpler and yet more effective. The
experimental results show that our model outperform the state-of-the-art models
in generating sentimental (i.e., sentiment-bearing) image captions. In
addition, we can also easily manipulate the model by assigning different
sentiments to the testing image to generate captions with the corresponding
sentiments.

counter terms that are active in the exotic flavour sextet channel. A chiral

developed and applied to the lattice data set. Good convergence properties are
demonstrated and an accurate reproduction of the lattice data based on
ensembles of PACS-CS, MILC, ETMC and HSC with pion and kaon masses smaller than

obtainable only if additional information from HSC on some scattering
observables is included in our global fits. The elastic and inelastic s-wave pi
D and eta D scattering as considered by HSC is reproduced faithfully. Based on
such low-energy parameters we predict 15 phase shifts and in-elasticities at
physical quark masses but also for an additional HSC ensemble at smaller pion
mass. In addition we find a clear signal for a member of the exotic flavour

introduced by Tadmor. The discussion is centered around the Euler equations of
fluid mechanics and the receding flow problem extensively studied by Liou. This
work is motivated by Liou's recent findings that an abnormal spike in
temperature observed with finite-volume schemes is linked to a spurious entropy
rise, and that it can be prevented in principle by conserving entropy. While a
semi-discrete analysis suggests EC schemes are a good fit, a fully discrete
analysis based on Tadmor's framework shows the non-negligible impact of
time-integration on the solution behavior. An EC time-integration scheme is
developed to show that enforcing conservation of entropy at the fully discrete
level does not necessarily guarantee a well-behaved solution.

  of the main result, and several new results. The title has changed. Comments
  are welcome!",,,,"math.GR math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that the (topological) full group of a minimal pseudogroup over the
Cantor set satisfies various rigidity phenomena of topological dynamical and
combinatorial nature.
  Our main result applies to its possible homomorphisms into other groups of
homeomorphisms, and implies that arbitrary homomorphisms between the full
groups of a vast class of pseudogroups must extend to continuous morphisms
between pseudogroups (in particular giving rise to equivariant maps at the
level of spaces). As applications, we obtain explicit obstructions to the
existence of embeddings between full groups in terms of invariants of the
underlying pseudogroups (the geometry of their orbital graphs, the complexity
function, dynamical homology), and provide a complete descriptions of all
homomorphisms within various families of groups including the Higman-Thompson
groups (more generally full groups of one sided shifts of finite type), full
groups of minimal $\mathbb{Z}$-actions on the Cantor set, and a class of groups
of interval exchanges.
  We next consider a combinatorial rigidity property of groups, which
formalises the inability of a group to act on any set with Schreier graphs
growing uniformly subexponentially, or more generally not faster than a given
function $f(n)$. For the exponential function this is a well-known consequence
of property $(T)$. We use full groups to provide a source of examples of groups
which satisfy this property but satisfy a strong negation of property $(T)$.
  A key tool used in the proofs is the study of the dynamics of the conjugation
action of groups on their space of subgroups, endowed with the Chabauty
topology. In particular we classify the confined and the uniformly recurrent
subgroups of full groups.

internal energy levels, proportional to their polarizabilities. In optical
frequency metrology, the Stark shift due to background black-body radiation
(BBR) modifies the frequency of the optical clock transition, and often
represents a large contribution to a clock's uncertainty budget. For clocks
based on singly-ionized ytterbium, the ion's complex structure makes this shift
difficult to calculate theoretically. We present a measurement of the
differential polarizabilities of two ultra-narrow optical clock transitions
present in $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$, performed by exposing the ion to an
oscillating electric field at a wavelength in the region of room temperature
BBR spectra. By measuring the frequency shift to the transitions caused by a
laser at $\lambda=7.17 \mu m$, we obtain values for scalar and tensor
differential polarizabilities with uncertainties at the percent level for both
the electric quadrupole and octupole transitions at 436nm and 467nm
respectively. These values agree with previously reported experimental
measurements and, in the case of the electric quadrupole transition, allow a
5-fold improvement in the determination of the room-temperature BBR shift.

charactarization presented and draw the reader's attention to the Note on

decoupled across sensors, with only some of the dual variables needed to be

the Planck CIB auto- and cross-power spectra (between different frequencies)
and CIBxCMB lensing cross-spectra measurements, as well as external constraints
(e.g. on the CIB mean brightness). We recovered an obscured star formation
history which agrees well with the values derived from infrared deep surveys
and we confirm that the obscured star formation dominates the unobscured one up
to at least z=4. The obscured and unobscured star formation rate densities are
compatible at $1\sigma$ at z=5. We also determined the evolution of the
effective bias of the galaxies emitting the CIB and found a rapid increase from
$\sim$0.8 at z$=$0 to $\sim$8 at z$=$4. At 2$<$z$<$4, this effective bias is
similar to that of galaxies at the knee of the mass functions and submillimeter
galaxies. This effective bias is the weighted average of the true bias with the
corresponding emissivity of the galaxies. The halo mass corresponding to this
bias is thus not exactly the mass contributing the most to the star formation
density. Correcting for this, we obtained a value of
log(M$_h$/M$_{\odot}$)=12.77$_{-0.125}^{+0.128}$ for the mass of the typical

states are quantized at $\kappa_{xy}=7/2$ and $\kappa_{xy}=3/2$ respectively in
a proper unit. However, a recent experiment shows the thermal Hall conductance
of $\nu=5/2$ FQH state is $\kappa_{xy}=5/2$. It has been speculated that the
system contains random Pf and APf domains driven by disorders, and the neutral
chiral Majorana modes on the domain walls may undergo a percolation transition
to a $\kappa_{xy}=5/2$ phase. In this work, we do perturbative and
non-perturbative analyses on the domain walls between Pf and APf. We show the
domain wall theory possesses an emergent SO(4) symmetry at energy scales below
a threshold $\Lambda_1$, which is lowered to an emergent U(1)$\times$U(1)
symmetry at energy scales between $\Lambda_1$ and a higher value $\Lambda_2$,
and is finally lowered to the composite fermion parity symmetry
$\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ above $\Lambda_2$. Based on the emergent symmetries, we
propose a phase diagram of the disordered $\nu=5/2$ FQH system, and show that a
$\kappa_{xy}=5/2$ phase arises at disorder energy scales $\Lambda>\Lambda_1$.
Furthermore, we show the gapped double-semion sector of $N_D$ compact domain
walls contributes non-local topological degeneracy $2^{N_D-1}$, causing a
low-temperature peak in the heat capacity. We implement a non-perturbative
method to bootstrap generic topological 1+1D domain walls (2-surface defects)
applicable to any 2+1D non-Abelian topological order. We identify potentially
relevant spin TQFTs for various $\nu = 5/2$ FQH states in terms of fermionic
version of U(1)$_{\pm 8}$ Chern-Simons theory $\times \mathbb{Z}_8$-class
TQFTs.

with odd viscosity. The odd viscosity is a peculiar part of the viscosity
tensor which does not result in dissipation and is allowed when parity symmetry
is broken. For the case of incompressible fluids, the odd viscosity manifests
itself through the free surface (no stress) boundary conditions. We first find
the free surface wave solutions of hydrodynamics in the linear approximation
and study the dispersion of such waves. As expected, the surface waves are
chiral and even exist in the absence of gravity and vanishing shear viscosity.
In this limit, we derive effective nonlinear Hamiltonian equations for the
surface dynamics, generalizing the linear solutions to the weakly nonlinear
case. Within the small surface angle approximation, the equation of motion
leads to a new class of non-linear chiral dynamics governed by what we dub the
{\it chiral} Burgers equation. The chiral Burgers equation is identical to the
complex Burgers equation with imaginary viscosity and an additional analyticity
requirement that enforces chirality. We present several exact solutions of the
chiral Burgers equation. For generic multiple pole initial conditions, the
system evolves to the formation of singularities in a finite time similar to
the case of an ideal fluid without odd viscosity. We also obtain a periodic
solution to the chiral Burgers corresponding to the non-linear generalization
of small amplitude linear waves.

CH3OH formation in a H2O-rich interstellar ice environment following the
OH-mediated H-abstraction in the reaction, CH4 + OH. Experimental conditions
are systematically varied to constrain the CH3OH formation yield at
astronomically relevant temperatures. CH4, O2, and hydrogen atoms are
co-deposited in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber at 10-20 K. OH radicals are
generated by the H + O2 surface reaction. Temperature programmed desorption -
quadrupole mass spectrometry (TPD-QMS) is used to characterize CH3OH formation,
and is complemented with reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS)
for CH3OH characterization and quantitation. CH3OH formation is shown to be
possible by the sequential surface reaction chain, CH4 + OH -> CH3 + H2O and
CH3 + OH -> CH3OH at 10-20 K. This reaction is enhanced by tunneling, as noted
in a recent theoretical investigation (Lamberts et al. 2017). The CH3OH
formation yield via the CH4 + OH route versus the CO + H route is approximately
20 times smaller for the laboratory settings studied. The astronomical
relevance of the new formation channel investigated here is discussed.

composite Higgs models, the coupling of the Higgs to gauge bosons can be
different from the Standard Model one. In this case, the multi-boson production
via vector boson fusion (VBF) can be hugely enhanced in comparison to the SM
production one due to the lack of cancellation in longitudinal vector boson
scattering. Among these processes, triple Higgs boson production in VBF plays a
special role - its enhancement is especially spectacular due to the absence of
background from transversely polarised vector bosons in the final state. While
the rates from $pp\to jjhhh$ production in vector boson fusion are too low at
the LHC and even at future 33 TeV $pp$ colliders, we have found that the 100

sub-GeV dark matter (DM) interactions will also be sensitive to solar neutrinos
via coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CNS), since the recoiling nucleus can
produce a small ionization signal. Solar neutrinos constitute both an
interesting signal in their own right and a potential background to a DM search
that cannot be controlled or reduced by improved shielding, material
purification and handling, or improved detector design. We explore these two
possibilities in detail for semiconductor (Si and Ge) and Xe targets,
considering several possibilities for the unmeasured ionization efficiency at
low energies. For DM-electron-scattering searches, neutrinos start being an
important background for exposures larger than ~1-10 kg-years in Si and Ge, and
for exposures larger than ~0.1-1 kg-year in Xe. For the absorption of bosonic
DM (dark photons and axion-like particles) by electrons, neutrinos are most
relevant for masses below ~1 keV and again slightly more important in Xe.
Treating the neutrinos as a signal, we find that the CNS of B-8 neutrinos can
be observed with ~2 sigma significance with exposures of ~2, 7, and 20 kg-years
in Xe, Ge, and Si, respectively, assuming there are no other backgrounds. We
give an example for how this would constrain non-standard neutrino
interactions. Neutrino components at lower energy can only be detected if the
ionization efficiency is sufficiently large. In this case, observing pep
neutrinos via CNS requires exposures ~10-100 kg-years in Si or Ge (~1000
kg-years in Xe), and observing CNO neutrinos would require an order of
magnitude more exposure. Only Si could potentially detect Be-7 neutrinos. These
measurements would allow for a direct measurement of the electron-neutrino
survival probability over a wide energy range.

features of unknown origin. Research on DIBs beyond the Local Group (LG) will
surely blossom in the era of the ELTs. A possibility that needs to be explored
is the use of integral field spectrographs. We do so by using MUSE data for the
Antennae Galaxy, the closest major galaxy merger. High S-to-N spectra were
created by co-adding the signal of many spatial elements. The emission of the
underlying stellar population was modeled using STARLIGHT. To our knowledge, we
have derived the first maps for the DIBs at l5780 and l5797 in galaxies outside
the LG. The l5780 DIB was detected in an area of ~0.6 arcmin2, corresponding to
a linear scale of ~25 kpc2. This region was sampled using >200 independent
lines of sight. The DIB l5797 was detected in >100 independent lines of sight.
Both DIBs are associated with a region with high emission in the HI 21 cm line,
implying a connection between atomic gas and DIBs, as the correlations for the
Milky Way also suggest. Conversely, there is mild spatial association between
the two DIBs and the molecular gas, in agreement with results for our Galaxy
that indicate a lack of correlation between DIBs and molecular gas. The overall
structure for the DIB strength distribution and extinction are comparable.
Within the system, the l5780 DIB clearly correlates with the extinction. Both
DIBs follow the relationship between equivalent width and reddening when data
for several galaxies are considered. Unidentified Infrared emission Bands
(UIBs, likely caused by PAHs) and the l5780 and l5797 DIBs show similar but not
identical spatial distributions. We attribute the differences to extinction
effects without necessarily implying a radically different nature of the
respective carriers. The results illustrate the enormous potential of integral
field spectrographs for extragalactic DIB research.

a broad shallow optical absorption feature centered at ~700 nm which is
detected at greater than 4-sigma significance. These features, confirmed
through multiple epochs of spectral photometry and spectroscopy, have
respectively been associated with ferric oxides and phyllosilicates. The
spectrum bears striking resemblance to those of some C-type asteroids,
suggesting that 2004 EW95 may share a common origin with those objects. 2004
EW95 orbits the Sun in a stable mean motion resonance with Neptune, at
relatively high eccentricity and inclination, suggesting it may have been
emplaced there by some past dynamical instability. These results appear
consistent with the aforementioned model predictions and are the first to show
a reliably confirmed detection of silicate material on a small KBO.

yet been studied. We therefore explore the RDI in gas which obeys ideal MHD and
is coupled to dust via both Lorentz forces and drag, with an external
acceleration (e.g., gravity, radiation) driving dust drift through gas. We show
this is always unstable, at all wavelengths and non-zero values of dust-to-gas
ratio, drift velocity, dust charge, 'stopping time' or drag coefficient (for
any drag law), or field strength; moreover growth rates depend only weakly
(sub-linearly) on these parameters. Dust charge and magnetic fields do not
suppress instabilities, but give rise to a large number of new instability
'families,' each with distinct behavior. The 'MHD-wave' (magnetosonic or
Alfven) RDIs exhibit maximal growth along 'resonant' angles where the modes
have a phase velocity matching the corresponding MHD wave, and growth rates
increase without limit with wavenumber. The 'gyro' RDIs are driven by
resonances between drift and Larmor frequencies, giving growth rates sharply
peaked at specific wavelengths. Other instabilities include 'acoustic' and
'pressure-free' modes (previously studied), and a family akin to cosmic ray
instabilities which appear when Lorentz forces are strong and dust streams
super-Alfvenically along field lines. We discuss astrophysical applications in

Hilbert spaces describing quantum field theories, or their finite-dimensional
discretizations on lattices, therefore have large amounts of structure: they
are isomorphic to the tensor product of a smaller Hilbert space for each
lattice site or point in space. Local field theories respecting this structure
have interactions which preferentially couple nearby points. The emergence of
classicality through decoherence relies on this framework of tensor-product
decomposition and local interactions. We explore the emergence of such lattice
structure from Hilbert-space considerations alone. We point out that the vast
majority of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces cannot be isomorphic to the
tensor product of Hilbert-space subfactors that describes a lattice theory. A
generic Hilbert space can only be split into a direct sum corresponding to a
basis of state vectors spanning the Hilbert space; we consider setups in which
the direct sum is naturally decomposed into two pieces. We define a notion of
direct-sum locality which characterizes states and decompositions compatible
with Hamiltonian time evolution. We illustrate these notions for a toy model
that is the finite-dimensional discretization of the quantum-mechanical
double-well potential. We discuss their relevance in cosmology and field
theory, especially for theories which describe a landscape of vacua with
different spacetime geometries.

short Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) at a distance of $40$Mpc, has demonstrated that
short GRBs can occur locally and at a reasonable rate. Furthermore,
gravitational waves enable us to detect close by GRBs, even when we are
observing at latitudes far from the jet's axis. We consider here Compton
echoes, the scattered light from the prompt and afterglow emission. Compton
echoes, an as yet undetected counterpart of GRBs, peak in X-rays and maintain a
roughly constant flux for hundreds to thousands of years after the burst.
Though too faint to be detected in typical cosmological GRBs, a fraction of
close by bursts with a sufficiently large energy output in X-rays, and for
which the surrounding medium is sufficiently dense, may indeed be observed in
this way. The detection of a Compton echo could provide unique insight into the
burst properties and the environment's density structure. In particular, it
could potentially determine whether or not there was a successful jet that
broke through the compact binary merger ejecta. We discuss here the properties
and expectations from Compton echoes and suggest methods for detectability.

expectations for the dark matter mass fractions (DMFs) and circular velocity
profiles of galaxies. TNG predicts flat circular velocity curves for $z = 0$
Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies beyond a few kpc from the galaxy centre, in better
agreement with observational constraints than its predecessor, Illustris. TNG
also predicts an enhancement of the dark matter mass within the 3D stellar
half-mass radius ($r_\mathrm{half}$; $M_\mathrm{200c} =
10^{10}-10^{13}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, $z \le2$) compared to its dark matter only
and Illustris counterparts. This enhancement leads TNG present-day galaxies to
be dominated by dark matter within their inner regions, with
$f_\mathrm{DM}(<r_\mathrm{half})\gtrsim0.5$ at all masses and with a minimum
for MW-mass galaxies. The 1$\sigma$ scatter is $\lesssim$ 10~per~cent at all
apertures, which is smaller than that inferred by some observational datasets,
e.g. 40 per cent from the SLUGGS survey. TNG agrees with the majority of the
observationally inferred values for elliptical galaxies once a consistent IMF
is adopted (Chabrier) and the DMFs are measured within the same apertures. The
DMFs measured within $r_\mathrm{half}$ increase towards lower redshifts: this
evolution is dominated by the increase in galaxy size with time. At $z\sim2$,
the DMF in disc-like TNG galaxies decreases with increasing galaxy mass, with
$f_\mathrm{DM}(<r_\mathrm{half}) \sim 0.10-0.65$ for $10^{10} \lesssim M_{\rm
stars}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{12}$, and are two times higher than if
TNG galaxies resided in Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter haloes unaffected by
baryonic physics. It remains to be properly assessed whether recent
observational estimates of the DMFs at $z\sim2$ rule out the contraction of the
dark matter haloes predicted by the TNG model.

standard Wigner states. Under Lorentz transformation the new basis states
transform in the Unitary Principal Continuous Series representation. These
states are obtained if we consider the little group of a null momentum
\textit{direction} rather than a null momentum. The definition of the states in
terms of the Wigner states makes it easier to study the action of space-time
translation in this basis. We show by taking into account the effect of
space-time translation that \textit{the dynamics of massless particles
described by these states takes place completely on the null-infinity of the
Minkowski space}. We then second quantize the theory in this basis and obtain a
unitary manifestly Poincare invariant (field) theory of free massless particles
living on null-infinity. The null-infinity arises in this case purely
group-theoretically without any reference to bulk space-time. Action of BMS on
massless particles is natural in this picture.
  As a by-product we generalize the conformal primary wave-functions for
massless particles in a way which makes the action of space-time translation
simple. Using these wave-functions we write down a modified Mellin(-Fourier)

covariant. Under Poincare transformation it transforms like products of

growth and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) throughout cosmic time;
however, there remain major uncertainties in translating radio luminosity
functions into a reliable assessment of the energy input as a function of
galaxy and/or dark matter halo mass. A crucial and long-standing problem is the
composition of the radio-lobe plasma that traces AGN jet activity. In this
paper, we carry out a systematic comparison of the plasma conditions in
Fanaroff & Riley class I and II radio galaxies to demonstrate conclusively that
their internal composition is systematically different. This difference is best
explained by the presence of an energetically dominant proton population in the
FRI, but not the FRII radio galaxies. We show that, as expected from this
systematic difference in particle content, radio morphology also affects the
jet-power/radio-luminosity relationship, with FRII radio galaxies having a
significantly lower ratio of jet power to radio luminosity than the FRI cluster
radio sources used to derive jet-power scaling relations via X-ray cavity
measurements. Finally we also demonstrate conclusively that lobe composition is
unconnected to accretion mode (optical excitation class): the internal
conditions of low- and high-excitation FRII radio lobes are indistinguishable.
We conclude that inferences of population-wide AGN impact require careful
assessment of the contribution of different jet sub-classes, particularly given
the increased diversity of jet evolutionary states expected to be present in
deep, low-frequency radio surveys such as the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey.

at least 100 kpc, as revealed by the absorption lines this gas imprints on the
spectra of background quasars. However, quasars are sparse and typically probe
only one narrow pencil beam through the intervening galaxy. Close quasar pairs
and gravitationally lensed quasars have been used to circumvent this inherently
one-dimensional technique, but these objects are rare and the structure of the
circum-galactic medium remains poorly constrained. As a result, our
understanding of the physical processes that drive the re-cycling of baryons
across the lifetime of a galaxy is limited. Here we report integral-field
(tomographic) spectroscopy of an extended background source -a bright giant
gravitational arc. We can thus coherently map the spatial and kinematic
distribution of Mg II absorption -a standard tracer of enriched gas- in an
intervening galaxy system at redshift 0.98 (i.e., ~8 Gyr ago). Our
gravitational-arc tomography unveils a clumpy medium in which the
absorption-strength decreases with increasing impact parameter, in good
agreement with the statistics towards quasars; furthermore, we find strong
evidence that the gas is not distributed isotropically. Interestingly, we
detect little kinematic variation over a projected area of ~600 kpc squared,
with all line-of-sight velocities confined to within a few tens of km/s of each
other. These results suggest that the detected absorption originates from
entrained recycled material, rather than in a galactic outflow.

system: a scalar field scattering a Kerr black hole confined inside a mirror
undergoes superradiant amplification that keeps repeating due to the reflecting
boundary conditions at the mirror. A similar charged black hole bomb system
exists if we have a charged scalar field propagating in a Reissner-Nordstrom
black hole confined inside a box. We point out that scalar fields propagating
in such a background are unstable not only to superradiance but also to a
mechanism known as the near-horizon scalar condensation instability. The two
instabilities are typically entangled but we identify regimes in the phase
space where one of them is suppressed but the other is present, and vice-versa
(we do this explicitly for the charged but non-rotating black hole bomb). These
`corners' in the phase space, together with a numerical study of the
instabilities allow us to identify accurately the onset of the instabilities.
Our results should thus be useful to make educated choices of initial data for
the Cauchy problem that follows the time evolution and endpoint of the
instabilities. Finally, we use a simple thermodynamic model (that makes no use
of the equations of motion) to find the leading order thermodynamic properties
of hairy black holes and solitons that should exist as a consequence (and that
should be the endpoint) of these instabilities. In a companion publication, we
explicitly solve the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar equations of motion to find the

to produce low emittance beams, 2) the study of electron cloud (EC) development
in a storage ring and 3) intra-beam scattering effects. The complete conversion
of CESR to CesrTA occurred over a several year period, described elsewhere. A
number of specific instruments were developed for CesrTA. Much of the
pre-existing instrumentation was modified to accommodate the scope of these
studies and these are described in a companion paper. To complete this
research, a number of procedures were developed or modified, often requiring
coordinated measurements among different instruments. This paper provides an
overview of types of measurements employed for the study of beam dynamics
during the operation of CesrTA.

predict the full spectral variation associated with individual element
abundance variation as a function of metallicity and age. The models span the
optical-NIR wavelength range (0.37-2.4um), include a range of initial mass
functions (IMFs) and contain the flexibility to vary 18 individual elements
including C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, and Fe. To test the fidelity of the models
we fit them to integrated light optical spectra of 41 Galactic globular
clusters (GCs). The value of testing models against GCs is that their ages,
metallicities, and detailed abundance patterns have been derived from the HR
diagram in combination with high resolution spectroscopy of individual stars.
We determine stellar population parameters from fits to all wavelengths
simultaneously (""full spectrum fitting""), and demonstrate explicitly with mock
tests that this approach produces smaller uncertainties at fixed S/N ratio than
fitting a standard set of 14 line indices. Comparison of our integrated-light
results to literature values reveals good agreement in metallicity, [Fe/H].
When restricting to GCs without prominent blue horizontal branch populations we
also find good agreement with literature values for ages, [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and

neuroscience investigating possible implementations of Bayes nets at the neural

particular, we enhance (or maximize) user fairness by solving the max-min
optimization problem for user rate, by power allocation and choice of receiver
coefficients, where the minimum uplink rate of the users is maximized with
available transmit power at the particular user. Based on the derived
closed-form expression for the uplink rate, we formulate the original user
max-min problem to design the optimal receiver coefficients and user power
allocations. However, this max-min SINR problem is not jointly convex in terms
of design variables and therefore we decompose this original problem into two
sub-problems, namely, receiver coefficient design and user power allocation. By
iteratively solving these sub-problems, we develop an iterative algorithm to
obtain the optimal receiver coefficient and user power allocations. In
particular, the receiver coefficients design for a fixed user power allocation
is formulated as generalized eigenvalue problem whereas a geometric programming
(GP) approach is utilized to solve the power allocation problem for a given set
of receiver coefficients. Numerical results confirm a three-fold increase in

part of the drug discovery process. Most of the computational methods that have
been proposed to predict DT interactions have focused on binary classification,
where the goal is to determine whether a DT pair interacts or not. However,
protein-ligand interactions assume a continuum of binding strength values, also
called binding affinity and predicting this value still remains a challenge.
The increase in the affinity data available in DT knowledge-bases allows the
use of advanced learning techniques such as deep learning architectures in the
prediction of binding affinities. In this study, we propose a deep-learning
based model that uses only sequence information of both targets and drugs to
predict DT interaction binding affinities. The few studies that focus on DT
binding affinity prediction use either 3D structures of protein-ligand

the modeling of protein sequences and compound 1D representations with
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results show that the proposed deep

an effective approach for drug target binding affinity prediction. The model in
which high-level representations of a drug and a target are constructed via
CNNs achieved the best Concordance Index (CI) performance in one of our larger

improve the performance of analytics and transactional workloads. However,
building several indexes over large datasets can often become prohibitive and
consume valuable system resources. In fact, a recent study showed that indexes
created as part of the TPC-C benchmark can account for 55% of the total memory
available in a modern DBMS. This overhead consumes valuable and expensive main
memory, and limits the amount of space available to store new data or process
existing data.
  In this paper, we present FITing-Tree, a novel form of a learned index which
uses piece-wise linear functions with a bounded error specified at construction
time. This error knob provides a tunable parameter that allows a DBA to FIT an
index to a dataset and workload by being able to balance lookup performance and
space consumption. To navigate this tradeoff, we provide a cost model that
helps determine an appropriate error parameter given either (1) a lookup
latency requirement (e.g., 500ns) or (2) a storage budget (e.g., 100MB). Using
a variety of real-world datasets, we show that our index is able to provide
performance that is comparable to full index structures while reducing the
storage footprint by orders of magnitude.

an uncertainty assessment derived from changes in the CHs and apply those
changes to the predicted solar wind speed profile at 1AU. We evaluate the
method for the time period 2008-2012, and compare the results to a persistence
model based on ACE in-situ measurements and to the STEREO persistence model
without implementing the information on CH evolution. Compared to an ACE based
persistence model, the performance of the STEREO persistence model which takes
into account the evolution of CHs, is able to increase the number of correctly
predicted high-speed streams by about 12%, and to decrease the number of missed
streams by about 23%, and the number of false alarms by about 19%. However, the
added information on CH evolution is not able to deliver more accurate speed
values for the forecast than using the STEREO persistence model without CH
information which performs better than an ACE based persistence model.
Investigating the CH evolution between STEREO and Earth view for varying
separation angles over ~25-140{\deg} East of Earth, we derive some relation
between expanding CHs and increasing solar wind speed, but a less clear
relation for decaying CHs and decreasing solar wind speed. This fact most
likely prevents the method from making more precise forecasts. The obtained
results support a future L5 mission and show the importance and valuable

learning techniques for image, voice and video processing. CNNs require large
amounts of processing capacity and memory bandwidth. Hardware accelerators have
been proposed for CNNs which typically contain large numbers of
multiply-accumulate (MAC) units, the multipliers of which are large in an
integrated circuit (IC) gate count and power consumption. ""Weight sharing""
accelerators have been proposed where the full range of weight values in a
trained CNN are compressed and put into bins and the bin index used to access
the weight-shared value. We reduce power and area of the CNN by implementing
parallel accumulate shared MAC (PASM) in a weight shared CNN. PASM
re-architects the MAC to instead count the frequency of each weight and place
it in a bin. The accumulated value is computed in a subsequent multiply phase,
significantly reducing gate count and power consumption of the CNN. In this
paper, we implement PASM in a weight-shared CNN convolution hardware
accelerator and analyze its effectiveness. Experiments show that for a clock
speed 1GHz implemented on a 45nm ASIC process our approach results in fewer
gates, smaller logic, and reduced power with only a slight increase in latency.
We also show that the same weight-shared-with-PASM CNN accelerator can be
implemented in resource-constrained FPGAs, where the FPGA has limited numbers
of digital signal processor (DSP) units to accelerate the MAC operations.

Humanoid mobility is a challenging problem, as the configuration space for a
humanoid robot is intractably large, especially if the robot is capable of
performing many types of locomotion. For example, a humanoid robot may be able
to perform such tasks as bipedal walking, crawling, and climbing. Our approach
is to plan for all these tasks within a single search process. This allows the
search to reason about all the capabilities of the robot at any point, and to
derive the complete solution such that the plan is guaranteed to be feasible. A
key observation is that we often can roughly decompose a mobility task into a
sequence of smaller tasks, and focus planning efforts to reason over much
smaller search spaces. To this end, we leverage the results of a recently
developed framework for planning with adaptive dimensionality, and incorporate
the capabilities of available controllers directly into the planning process.
The resulting planner can also be run in an interleaved fashion alongside
execution so that time spent idle is much reduced.

the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is
also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in
standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on
a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing blockchain
platforms that require ""smart-contracts"" to be written in domain-specific

using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with
industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric
introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains
cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.
  This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various
design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its

low dimensions, still in widespread use today. Originally introduced in the
1950's, MDS was not designed with high-dimensional data in mind; while it
remains popular with data analysis practitioners, no doubt it should be adapted
to the high-dimensional data regime. In this paper we study MDS under modern
setting, and specifically, high dimensions and ambient measurement noise. We
show that, as the ambient noise level increase, MDS suffers a sharp breakdown
that depends on the data dimension and noise level, and derive an explicit
formula for this breakdown point in the case of white noise. We then introduce
MDS+, an extremely simple variant of MDS, which applies a carefully derived
shrinkage nonlinearity to the eigenvalues of the MDS similarity matrix. Under a
loss function measuring the embedding quality, MDS+ is the unique
asymptotically optimal shrinkage function. We prove that MDS+ offers improved
embedding, sometimes significantly so, compared with classical MDS.
Furthermore, MDS+ does not require external estimates of the embedding
dimension (a famous difficulty in classical MDS), as it calculates the optimal
dimension into which the data should be embedded.

system is believed to be the result of a face-on collision between two gas-rich
galaxies, in which the stellar disks passed through each other, but the gas was
dispersed into a massive H I and molecular bridge between them. Emission is
detected and mapped in both galaxies and the bridge in the [C II]157.7 $\mu$m

detects the [C I] $^3$P$_2$$\rightarrow$$^3$P$_1$(809.3 GHz) and [C I]
$^3$P$_1$$\rightarrow$$3$P$_0$(492.2 GHz) neutral carbon lines, and weakly
detects high-J CO transitions in the bridge. These results indicate that the
bridge is composed of a warm multi-phase medium consistent with shock and
turbulent heating. Despite low star formation rates in the bridge, the [C II]
emission appears to be enhanced, reaching [C II]/FIR ratios of 3.3% in parts of
the bridge. Both the [C II] and [O I] lines show broad intrinsic
multi-component profiles, similar to those seen in previous CO 1-0 and H I
observations. The [C II] emission shares similar line profiles with both the
double-peaked H I profiles and shares a high-velocity component with
single-peaked CO profiles in the bridge, suggesting that the [C II] emission
originates in both the neutral and molecular phases. We show that it is
feasible that a combination of turbulently heated H$_2$ and high column-density
H I, resulting from the galaxy collision, is responsible for the enhanced [C
II] emission.

only and coupled spin-lattice dynamics are first reviewed, including a detailed
account of how magneto-mechanical potentials can be used to perform a proper
coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom. A symplectic numerical
integration algorithm is then presented which combines the Suzuki-Trotter
decomposition for non-commuting variables and conserves the geometric
properties of the equations of motion. The numerical accuracy of the serial
implementation was assessed by verifying that it conserves the total energy and
the norm of the total magnetization up to second order in the timestep size.
Finally, a very general parallel algorithm is proposed that allows large
spin-lattice systems to be efficiently simulated on large numbers of processors
without degrading its mathematical accuracy. Its correctness as well as scaling
efficiency were tested for realistic coupled spin-lattice systems, confirming
that the new parallel algorithm is both accurate and efficient.

rate and the mode of twinning greatly influences the mechanical behavior
including strength and ductility. Herein, we study deformation twinning in
terms of nucleation, twinning mode and variant selection as a function of
strain rate in Mg single crystal (considered as a model material). We show that
twin variant selection is sensitive to the loading rate, with more twin
variants nucleating at the dynamic strain rates. Low Schmid factor twin
variants (one of them being a double extension twin variant) were also found at
the dynamic strain rates. Further at high strain rates, the first twins
generated do not thicken beyond a critical width. Instead, plasticity proceeds
with nucleation of second generation twins from the primary twin boundaries.
The rates of area/volume fraction evolution of both generations of twins are

present rich novel possibilities for representation and interaction. In this
paper, we explore the challenges that arise naturally from considering the
emoji modality through the lens of multimedia research. Specifically, the ways
in which emoji can be related to other common modalities such as text and
images. To do so, we first present a large scale dataset of real-world emoji
usage collected from Twitter. This dataset contains examples of both text-emoji
and image-emoji relationships. We present baseline results on the challenge of
predicting emoji from both text and images, using state-of-the-art neural
networks. Further, we offer a first consideration into the problem of how to
account for new, unseen emoji - a relevant issue as the emoji vocabulary
continues to expand on a yearly basis. Finally, we present results for
multimedia retrieval using emoji as queries.

histology of the liver of reptiles. The aim of the current study was to
elucidate the histological architecture of the liver of the Nile monitor
(Varanus niloticus). Liver fragments from the Nile monitor were collected in
the summer season and processed for the light and electron microscopy. The
liver of the Nile monitor was bi-lobed and the right lobe was found to be
larger than the left lobe. Histological examination revealed indistinct
lobulation of the liver, and the central vein, sinusoids and portal area were
haphazardly organized. The hepatic parenchyma consisted of hepatocytes arranged
in glandular-like alveoli or tubules separated by a network of twisted
capillary sinusoids. The hepatocytes were polyhedral in shape with vacuolated
cytoplasm and the nucleus was single rounded, eccentric, large and vesicular
with a distinct nucleolus. The hepatocytes contained numerous lipid droplets,
abundant glycogen granules and well-developed RER and mitochondria. The
hepatocytes appeared to secrete into the bile canaliculi through the
disintegration of their dark cytoplasm into the bile canaliculi. The space of
Disse separating between the hepatocytes and sinusoids contained many recesses.
The portal area contained branches of the portal vein, hepatic artery, bile
duct and lymphatic vessels embedded in a connective tissue. Some
non-parenchymal cells were described such as Kupffer cells, heterophils,
melano-macrophages, intercalated cells, myofibroblasts in addition to the
endothelium of the sinusoids. This is the first report about the histological
structure of the liver of the Egyptian Nile monitor. The result presented here
should be considered a baseline knowledge to compare with the pathological
affections of the liver in this species.

the usage of GPs in real-world application is limited due to their high
computational cost at inference time. In this paper, we introduce a new
framework, \textit{kernel distillation}, to approximate a fully trained teacher
GP model with kernel matrix of size $n\times n$ for $n$ training points. We
combine inducing points method with sparse low-rank approximation in the

  2017",,,,"cs.LO math.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper (as in [Ken15]), we consider an effective version of the
characterization of separable metric spaces as zero-dimensional iff every
nonempty closed subset is a retract of the space (actually, it is a relative
result for closed zero-dimensional subspaces of a fixed space that we have
proved). This uses (in the converse direction) local compactness & bilocated
sets as in [Ken15], but in the forward direction the newer version has a
simpler proof and no compactness assumption. Furthermore, the proof of the
forward implication relates to so-called Dugundji systems: we elaborate both a
general construction of such systems for a proper nonempty closed subspace
(using a computable form of countable paracompactness), and modifications -- to
make the sets pairwise disjoint if the subspace is zero-dimensional, or to
avoid the restriction to proper subspaces. In a different direction, a second
theorem applies in $p$-adic analysis the ideas of the first theorem to compute
a more general form of retraction, given a Dugundji system (possibly without
disjointness).
  Finally, we complement the effective retract characterization of
zero-dimensional subspaces mentioned above by improving to equivalence the
implications (or Weihrauch reductions in some cases), for closed
at-most-zero-dimensional subsets with some negative information, among separate
conditions of computability of operations $N,M,B,S$ introduced in [Ken15,\S 4]
and corresponding to vanishing large inductive dimension, vanishing small
inductive dimension, existence of a countable basis of relatively clopen sets,
and the reduction principle for sequences of open sets. Thus, similarly to the
robust notion of effective zero-dimensionality of computable metric spaces in
[Ken15], there is a robust notion of `uniform effective zero-dimensionality'
for a represented pointclass consisting of at-most-zero-dimensional closed
subsets.

wireless services with heterogeneous quality-of-service needs. However, beyond
satisfying end-to-end requirements of network users, network slicing needs to
also provide isolation between slices so as to prevent one slice's faults and
congestion from affecting other slices. In this paper, the problem of network
slicing is studied in the context of a wireless system having a time-varying
number of users that require two types of slices: reliable low latency (RLL)
and self-managed (capacity limited) slices. To address this problem, a novel
control framework for stochastic optimization is proposed based on the Lyapunov
drift-plus-penalty method. This new framework enables the system to minimize
power, maintain slice isolation, and provide reliable and low latency
end-to-end communication for RLL slices. Simulation results show that the
proposed approach can maintain the system's reliability while providing
effective slice isolation in the event of sudden changes in the network

each others's contributions to the photocurrent. However this cancelation does
not occur if the Weyl semimetal possesses both a broken particle-hole symmetry

photocurrent the helical magnetic effect because it is induced by the helicity
imbalance in a magnetic field. We find that due to the large density of states

photocurrent for incident THz frequency light. This suggests a potential
application of asymmetric Weyl semimetals for creating THz photosensors.

of field stars with similar metallicity. As expected, s-process elements in
four known Ba giants show overabundance. A weak correlation was found between
anomalies of s-process elemental abundance and orbital separation, suggesting
the orbital separation of the binaries could not be the main constraint to
differentiate strong Ba stars from mild Ba stars. Our study shows that the
large mass (>0.51 M ) of a WD companion in a binary system is not a sufficient
condition to form a Ba star, even if the separation between the two components
is small. Although not sufficient it seems to be a necessary condition since Ba
stars with lower mass WDs in the observed sample were not found. Our results
support that [s/Fe] and [hs/ls] ratios of Ba stars are anti-correlated with the

i.e., the long run discounted reward of the MDP. The current settings also
assume access to a generative model of the MDP with the hidden premise that
observations of the system behaviour in the form of sample trajectories can be
obtained with ease from the model. In this paper, we consider a modified

that a sample trajectory generated using a priori chosen behaviour policy is

experimentally feasible design of 2D honeycomb CROW photonic structure. The
characteristic optical system possesses two-fold and three-fold Dirac points at
different positions in the Brillouin zone. The effective gauge fields
implemented by the intrinsic pseudo-spin-orbit interaction open up
topologically nontrivial bandgaps through the Dirac points. Spatial lattice
geometries allow destructive wave interference, leading to a dispersionless,
nearly-flat energy band in the vicinity of the three-fold Dirac point in the
telecommunication frequency regime. This nontrivial nearly-flat band yields
topologically protected edge states. The pertinent physical effects brought
about due to non-Hermitian gain/loss medium into the honeycomb CROW device are
discussed. The generalized gain-loss lattice with parity-time symmetry
decouples the gain and the loss at opposite zigzag edges, leading to purely
gain or loss edge channels. Meanwhile, the gain and loss effects on the
armchair boundary cancel each other, giving rise to dissipationless edge states
in non-Hermitian optical systems. These characteristics underpin the
fundamental importance as well as the potential applications in various optical
devices such as polarizers, optical couplers, beam splitters and slow light

photocurrent, termed shift current, is expected to emerge on the time-scale of
primary photoexcitation process. We observed ultrafast time evolution of the
shift current in a prototypical ferroelectric semiconductor by detecting
emitted terahertz electromagnetic waves. By sweeping the excitation photon
energy across the band gap, ultrafast electron dynamics as a source of

Berry connection upon interband optical transition. The shift excitation
carries a net charge flow, and is followed by a swing-over of the electron

We combine all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with a mean field model of
interfacial hydrogen bonding to analyze the effect of surface-water
interactions on the structural and energetic properties of the liquid water
interface. We find that the molecular structure of water at a weakly
interacting (i.e., hydrophobic) surface is resistant to change unless the
strength of surface-water interactions are above a certain threshold. We find
that below this threshold water's interfacial structure is homogeneous and
insensitive to the details of the disordered surface, however, above this
threshold water's interfacial structure is heterogeneous. Despite this
heterogeneity, we demonstrate that the equilibrium distribution of molecular
orientations can be used to quantify the energetic component of the
surface-water interactions that contribute specifically to modifying the
interfacial hydrogen bonding network. We identify this specific energetic
component as a new measure of hydrophilicity, which we refer to as the
intrinsic hydropathy.

speed and robustness. The recently proposed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
based methods have shown good performance in learning spatio-temporal
representations for skeleton sequences. Despite the good recognition accuracy
achieved by previous CNN based methods, there exist two problems that
potentially limit the performance. First, previous skeleton representations are
generated by chaining joints with a fixed order. The corresponding semantic
meaning is unclear and the structural information among the joints is lost.
Second, previous models do not have an ability to focus on informative joints.
The attention mechanism is important for skeleton based action recognition
because there exist spatio-temporal key stages while the joint predictions can
be inaccurate. To solve these two problems, we propose a novel CNN based method
for skeleton based action recognition. We first redesign the skeleton
representations with a depth-first tree traversal order, which enhances the
semantic meaning of skeleton images and better preserves the associated
structural information. We then propose the idea of a two-branch attention
architecture that focuses on spatio-temporal key stages and filters out
unreliable joint predictions. A base attention model with the simplest
structure is first introduced. By improving the structures in both branches, we
further propose a Global Long-sequence Attention Network (GLAN). Furthermore,
in order to adjust the kernel's spatio-temporal aspect ratios and better
capture long term dependencies, we propose a Sub-Sequence Attention Network
(SSAN) that takes sub-image sequences as inputs. Our experiment results on NTU

process to quantify the uncertainties of random input parameters based on
experimental data. The introduction of model discrepancy term is significant
because ""over-fitting"" can theoretically be avoided. But it also poses
challenges in the practical applications. One of the mostly concerned and
unresolved problem is the ""lack of identifiability"" issue. With the presence of
model discrepancy, inverse UQ becomes ""non-identifiable"" in the sense that it
is difficult to precisely distinguish between the parameter uncertainties and
model discrepancy when estimating the calibration parameters. Previous research
to alleviate the non-identifiability issue focused on using informative priors
for the calibration parameters and the model discrepancy, which is usually not
a viable solution because one rarely has such accurate and informative prior
knowledge. In this work, we show that identifiability is largely related to the
sensitivity of the calibration parameters with regards to the chosen responses.
We adopted an improved modular Bayesian approach for inverse UQ that does not
require priors for the model discrepancy term. The relationship between
sensitivity and identifiability was demonstrated with a practical example in
nuclear engineering. It was shown that, in order for a certain calibration
parameter to be statistically identifiable, it should be significant to at
least one of the responses whose data are used for inverse UQ. Good
identifiability cannot be achieved for a certain calibration parameter if it is
not significant to any of the responses. It is also demonstrated that ""fake
identifiability"" is possible if model responses are not appropriately chosen,
or inaccurate but informative priors are specified.

Russian Resurs-DK1 satellite, and during ten years of nearly continuous
data-taking it has observed new interesting features in cosmic rays (CRs). In a
decade of operation it has provided plenty of scientific data, covering
different issues related to cosmic ray physics. Its discoveries might change
our basic vision of the mechanisms of production, acceleration and propagation
of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. The antimatter measurements, focus of the
experiment, have set strong constraints to the nature of Dark Matter. Search
for signatures of more exotic processes (such as the ones involving Strange
Quark Matter) was also pursued. Furthermore, the long-term operation of the
instrument had allowed a constant monitoring of the solar activity during its
maximum and a detailed and prolonged study of the solar modulation, improving
the comprehension of the heliosphere mechanisms. PAMELA had also measured the
radiation environment around the Earth, and it detected for the first time the
presence of an antiproton radiation belt surrounding our planet. The operation
of Resurs-DK1 was terminated in 2016. In this article we will review the main
features of the PAMELA instrument and its constructing phases. Main part of the

preliminary factor analysis suggests that the main altmetric indicator of
scholarly impact is Mendeley reader counts, with weaker news, informational and
social network discussion/promotion dimensions in some fields. Based on a
regression analysis of Altmetric.com data from November 2015 and Scopus
citation counts from October 2017 for articles in 30 narrow fields, only
Mendeley reader counts are consistent predictors of future citation impact.
Most other Altmetric.com scores can help predict future impact in some fields.
Overall, the results confirm that early Altmetric.com scores can predict later
citation counts, although less well than journal impact factors, and the
optimal strategy is to consider both Altmetric.com scores and journal impact
factors. Altmetric.com scores can also reflect dimensions of non-scholarly

  Linked Question Answer Pairs with a Knowledge Graph","Accepted in AAAI'18",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While conversing with chatbots, humans typically tend to ask many questions,
a significant portion of which can be answered by referring to large-scale
knowledge graphs (KG). While Question Answering (QA) and dialog systems have
been studied independently, there is a need to study them closely to evaluate
such real-world scenarios faced by bots involving both these tasks. Towards
this end, we introduce the task of Complex Sequential QA which combines the two
tasks of (i) answering factual questions through complex inferencing over a
realistic-sized KG of millions of entities, and (ii) learning to converse
through a series of coherently linked QA pairs. Through a labor intensive
semi-automatic process, involving in-house and crowdsourced workers, we created
a dataset containing around 200K dialogs with a total of 1.6M turns. Further,
unlike existing large scale QA datasets which contain simple questions that can
be answered from a single tuple, the questions in our dialogs require a larger
subgraph of the KG. Specifically, our dataset has questions which require
logical, quantitative, and comparative reasoning as well as their combinations.
This calls for models which can: (i) parse complex natural language questions,
(ii) use conversation context to resolve coreferences and ellipsis in
utterances, (iii) ask for clarifications for ambiguous queries, and finally
(iv) retrieve relevant subgraphs of the KG to answer such questions. However,
our experiments with a combination of state of the art dialog and QA models
show that they clearly do not achieve the above objectives and are inadequate
for dealing with such complex real world settings. We believe that this new
dataset coupled with the limitations of existing models as reported in this
paper should encourage further research in Complex Sequential QA.

the correlation length, and that the formula enables precise evaluation of the

application prospects in lighting, however, remain still uncertain due to a
variety of shortcomings in device performance including their limited levels of
luminous efficiency achievable thus far. Here we show high-efficiency PeLEDs
based on colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) synthesized at room
temperature possessing dominant first-order excitonic radiation (enabling a
photoluminescence quantum yield of 71% in solid film), unlike in the case of
bulk perovskites with slow electron-hole bimolecular radiative recombination (a
second-order process). In these PeLEDs, by reaching charge balance in the
recombination zone, we find that the Auger nonradiative recombination, with its
significant role in emission quenching, is effectively suppressed in low
driving current density range. In consequence, these devices reach a record
high maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.9% reported to date and an
unprecedentedly high power efficiency of 30.3 lm W-1 at luminance levels above
1000 cd m-2 as required for various applications. These findings suggest that,
with feasible levels of device performance, the PeNCs hold great promise for
their use in LED lighting and displays.

because the execution of the learned policy might lead to collisions and other
failures. Adding explicit constraints to avoid unsafe states is generally not
possible when the state representations are complex. Furthermore, enforcing
these constraints during execution of the learned policy can be challenging in
environments where dynamics are difficult to model such as push mechanics in
grasping. In this paper, we propose Derivative-Free Recovery (DFR), a two-phase
method for generating robust policies from demonstrations in robotic
manipulation tasks where the system comes to rest at each time step. In the
first phase, we use support estimation of supervisor demonstrations and treat
the support as implicit constraints on states. We also propose a time-varying
modification for sequential tasks. In the second phase, we use this support
estimate to derive a switching policy that employs the learned policy in the
interior of the support and switches to a recovery policy to steer the robot
away from the boundary of the support if it drifts too close. We present
additional conditions, which linearly bound the difference in state at each
time step by the magnitude of control, allowing us to prove that the robot will
not violate the constraints using the recovery policy. A simulated pushing task
in MuJoCo suggests that DFR can reduce collisions by 83\%. On a physical line
tracking task using a da Vinci Surgical Robot and a moving Stewart platform,
DFR reduced collisions by 84\%.

recently, have fascinating features: they are robust against perturbation,
produce no stray fields, and exhibit ultrafast dynamics. Discerning how to
efficiently manipulate the magnetic state of an antiferromagnet is key to the
development of antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this review, we introduce four
main methods (magnetic, strain, electrical, and optical) to mediate the
magnetic states and elaborate on intrinsic origins of different
antiferromagnetic materials. Magnetic control includes a strong magnetic field,
exchange bias, and field cooling, which are traditional and basic. Strain
control involves the magnetic anisotropy effect or metamagnetic transition.
Electrical control can be divided into two parts, electric field and electric
current, both of which are convenient for practical applications. Optical
control includes thermal and electronic excitation, an inertia-driven
mechanism, and terahertz laser control, with the potential for ultrafast
antiferromagnetic manipulation. This review sheds light on effective usage of
antiferromagnets and provides a new perspective on antiferromagnetic
spintronics.

set of random measurements has attracted considerable attentions in recent
years. Due to the high dimensionality of images, previous CS methods mainly
work on image blocks to avoid the huge requirements of memory and computation,
i.e., image blocks are measured with Gaussian random matrices, and the whole
images are recovered from the reconstructed image blocks. Though efficient,
such methods suffer from serious blocking artifacts. In this paper, we propose
a convolutional CS framework that senses the whole image using a set of
convolutional filters. Instead of reconstructing individual blocks, the whole
image is reconstructed from the linear convolutional measurements.
Specifically, the convolutional CS is implemented based on a convolutional
neural network (CNN), which performs both the convolutional CS and nonlinear
reconstruction. Through end-to-end training, the sensing filters and the
reconstruction network can be jointly optimized. To facilitate the design of
the CS reconstruction network, a novel two-branch CNN inspired from a
sparsity-based CS reconstruction model is developed. Experimental results show
that the proposed method substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art CS
methods in term of both PSNR and visual quality.

finite supercurrent flows at vanishing phase difference. Finally, we also

the quantum capacitance (CQ) in a dual-gate monolayer exfoliated MoS2 FET. The
CQ analysis enabled us to construct a Dit extraction method as a function of
EF. A band tail distribution of Dit with the lowest value of 8*1011 cm-2eV-1
suggests that Dit is not directly related to the sharp peak energy distribution
of the S vacancy. Therefore, the Mo-S bond bending related to the strain at the
interface or the surface roughness of the SiO2/Si substrate might be the
origin. It is also shown that ultra-thin 2D materials are more sensitive to
interface disorder due to the reduced density of states. Since all the

d from a noisy cloud of n points lying nearby in the Wasserstein sense. In
practice, these sub-level sets may be computed using approximations of the DTM

approaches lead eventually to compute the homology of unions of n growing
balls, that might become intractable whenever n is large. To simultaneously
face the two problems of large number of points and noise, we introduce the

sublevel sets consist in union of k-balls, k << n, and this distance is also

tribaryon configuration against the lowest three nucleon threshold within a
constituent quark model, we show that the three nucleon forces have to be
repulsive at short distance for all possible quantum numbers and all values of
the SU(3) symmetry breaking parameter. Our work identifies the origin of the
repulsive nuclear three body forces including the hyperons at short distance
that are called for from phenomenological considerations starting from nuclear
matter to the maximum mass of a neutron star.

its drawbacks is the need for multi-lens in the imaging. To compensate that,

compressed version of the regular multi-lens system. The acquisition system
consists of a dedicated hardware followed by a decompression algorithm, which
usually suffers from high computational time. In this work, we propose a
computationally efficient neural network that recovers a high-quality color
light field from a single coded image. Unlike previous works, we compress the
color channels as well, removing the need for a CFA in the imaging system. Our
approach outperforms existing solutions in terms of recovery quality and

applying the artificial neural networks (ANN) to the hyperspectral images
classification. To fuse the spatial and spectral information, pixel patches are
often utilized to train a model, which may further aggregate this problem. In
the existing works, an ANN model supervised by center-loss (ANNC) was
introduced. Training merely with spectral information, the ANNC yields
discriminative spectral features suitable for the subsequent classification
tasks. In this paper, a CNN-based spatial feature fusion (CSFF) algorithm is
proposed, which allows a smart fusion of the spatial information to the
spectral features extracted by ANNC. As a critical part of CSFF, a CNN-based
discriminant model is introduced to estimate whether two paring pixels belong
to the same class. At the testing stage, by applying the discriminant model to
the pixel-pairs generated by the test pixel and its neighbors, the local
structure is estimated and represented as a customized convolutional kernel.
The spectral-spatial feature is obtained by a convolutional operation between
the estimated kernel and the corresponding spectral features within a
neighborhood. At last, the label of the test pixel is predicted by classifying
the resulting spectral-spatial feature. Without increasing the number of
training samples or involving pixel patches at the training stage, the CSFF
framework achieves the state-of-the-art by declining $20\%-50\%$ classification
failures in experiments on three well-known hyperspectral images.

patterns of neural activity, as recorded by diverse electrophysiological and
neuroimaging techniques, is a central challenge in neuroscience. Such patterns
include collective oscillations emerging out of neural synchronization as well
as highly heterogeneous outbursts of activity interspersed by periods of
quiescence, called ""neuronal avalanches."" Much debate has been generated about
the possible scale invariance or criticality of such avalanches and its
relevance for brain function. Aimed at shedding light onto this, here we
analyze the large-scale collective properties of the cortex by using a
mesoscopic approach following the principle of parsimony of Landau-Ginzburg.
Our model is similar to that of Wilson-Cowan for neural dynamics but crucially,
includes stochasticity and space; synaptic plasticity and inhibition are
considered as possible regulatory mechanisms. Detailed analyses uncover a phase
diagram including down-state, synchronous, asynchronous, and up-state phases
and reveal that empirical findings for neuronal avalanches are consistently
reproduced by tuning our model to the edge of synchronization. This reveals
that the putative criticality of cortical dynamics does not correspond to a
quiescent-to-active phase transition as usually assumed in theoretical
approaches but to a synchronization phase transition, at which incipient
oscillations and scale-free avalanches coexist. Furthermore, our model also
accounts for up and down states as they occur (e.g., during deep sleep). This
approach constitutes a framework to rationalize the possible collective phases
and phase transitions of cortical networks in simple terms, thus helping to
shed light on basic aspects of brain functioning from a very broad perspective.

branch (post-EHB) stars are generally characterized by rotational broadening
with values of $V_{\rm rot} \sin i$ between 25 and 30 km~s$^{-1}$ can be
explained as a natural consequence of the conservation of angular momentum from
the previous He-core burning phase on the EHB. The progenitors of these evolved
objects, the EHB stars, are known to be slow rotators with an average value of
$V_{\rm rot} \sin i$ of $\sim$7.7 km~s$^{-1}$. This implies significant spin-up
between the EHB and post-EHB phases. Using representative evolutionary models
of hot subdwarf stars, we demonstrate that angular momentum conservation in
uniformly rotating strutures (rigid-body rotation) boosts that value of the
projected equatorial rotation speed by a factor $\sim$3.6 by the time the model
has reached the region of the surface gravity-effective temperature plane where
the newly-studied post-EHB objects are found. This is exactly what is needed to
account for their observed atmospheric broadening. We note that the decrease of
the moment of inertia causing the spin-up is mostly due to the redistribution
of matter that produces more centrally-condensed structures in the post-EHB
phase of evolution, not to the decrease of the radius per se.

network coding for improved throughput over conventional relaying in a fading
channel. Energy-efficient noncoherent operation is achieved using multitone
frequency shift keying (FSK). A novel soft-output demodulator is developed for
the relay, and corresponding achievable exchange rates are found for Rayleigh
fading and AWGN channels. Bit-error rate performance approaching the achievable
rate is realized using a capacity-approaching channel code and a receiver
architecture that iterates between demodulation and channel decoding. Iterative
decoding is performed feeding information back from the channel decoder to the
demodulator. Additionally, error-rate performance is made to approach the
achievable rate more closely by optimizing LDPC codes for this system. The
energy efficiency improvement obtained by increasing the modulation order is
more dramatic for the proposed physical-layer network coding scheme than it is
for a conventional point-to-point system. Using optimized LDPC codes, the
bit-error rate performance is improved by as much as 1.1 dB over a widely known
standardized LDPC code, and comes to within 0.7 dB of the limit corresponding
to the achievable rate. Throughout this work, performance for physical-layer
network coding is compared to conventional network coding. When noncoherent FSK
is used, physical-layer network coding enables higher achievable rates, and
conventional network coding exhibits better energy efficiency at low rates.

realization of plasmonic surface traps for cold atoms. The trapping mechanism
is based on the combination of a repulsive and an attractive potential
generated by evanescent light waves that are plasmonically enhanced. The
strength of enhancement can be locally manipulated via the thickness of a metal
nanolayer deposited on top of a dielectric substrate. Thus, in principle
arbitrary potential landscapes can be generated. We present simulations of a
plasmonic lattice potential using a gold grating with sinusoidally modulated
thickness. Experimentally, a first plasmonic test structure is presented and
characterized. Furthermore, the surface potential landscape is detected by
reflecting ultracold atom clouds from the test structure revealing the
influence of both evanescent waves. A parameter range is identified, where
stable traps can be expected.

characterised by the H$\alpha$ line. In the most active M dwarfs, H$\alpha$ is
found in emission, sometimes with a complex line profile. Previous studies have
reported extended wings and asymmetries in the H$\alpha$ line during flares. We
used a total of 473 high-resolution spectra of 28 active M dwarfs obtained by
the CARMENES (Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exo-earths
with Near-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrographs) spectrograph to study the
occurrence of broadened and asymmetric H$\alpha$ line profiles and their
association with flares, and examine possible physical explanations. We
detected a total of 41 flares and 67 broad, potentially asymmetric, wings in
H$\alpha$. The broadened H$\alpha$ lines display a variety of profiles with
symmetric cases and both red and blue asymmetries. Although some of these line
profiles are found during flares, the majority are at least not obviously
associated with flaring. We propose a mechanism similar to coronal rain or
chromospheric downward condensations as a cause for the observed red
asymmetries; the symmetric cases may also be caused by Stark broadening. We
suggest that blue asymmetries are associated with rising material, and our
results are consistent with a prevalence of blue asymmetries during the flare
onset. Besides the H$\alpha$ asymmetries, we find some cases of additional line
asymmetries in \ion{He}{i} D$_{3}$, \ion{Na}{i}~D lines, and the \ion{He}{i}
line at 10830\,\AA\, taken all simultaneously thanks to the large wavelength
coverage of CARMENES. Our study shows that asymmetric H$\alpha$ lines are a
rather common phenomenon in M~dwarfs and need to be studied in more detail to
obtain a better understanding of the atmospheric dynamics in these objects.

been shown to produce accelerating gradients on the order of GeV/m. In simple
$\beta$-matched grating structures due to the nature of the laser induced
steady-state in-channel fields the per period forces on the particles are
mostly in longitudinal direction. Even though strong transverse magnetic and
electric fields are present, the net focusing effect over one period at maximum
energy gain is negligible in the case of relativistic electrons. Stable
acceleration of realistic electron beams in a DLA channel however requires the
presence of significant net transverse forces. In this work we simulate and
study the effect of using the transient temporal shape of short Gaussian drive
laser pulses in order to achieve suitable field configurations for potentially
stable acceleration of relativistic electrons in the horizontal plane. In order
to achieve this, both the laser pulse and the grating geometry are optimized.
Simulations conducted with the Particle-In-Cell code VSim 7.2 are shown for
both the transient and steady state/long pulse case. Finally we investigate how
the drive laser phase dependence of the focusing forces could affect a
potential DLA-based focusing lattice.

in different ways. Moreover, the local gravitational interaction affecting
baryonic matter can be naturally described in terms of gravitons pulled out
from this Dark Energy condensate (DEC). We then explain the additional
component of the acceleration at galactic scales, commonly attributed to dark
matter, as the reaction of the DEC to the presence of baryonic matter. This
additional dark force is also associated to gravitons pulled out from the DEC
and correctly reproduces the MOND acceleration. It also allows for an effective
description in terms of General Relativity sourced by an anisotropic fluid. We
finally calculate the mass ratio between the contribution of the apparent dark

hyperboloidal method. That method takes advantage of the commutation properties

resolve the difficulties caused by the fact that they have, separately,

it requires compactly supported data. In this paper we remove this limitation

involves an intractable normalising constant. Two popular methods for parameter

While the asymptotics of MC-MLE have been established under general hypotheses
(Geyer, 1994), this is not so for NCE. We establish consistency and asymptotic
normality of NCE estimators under mild assumptions. We compare NCE and MC-MLE
under several asymptotic regimes. In particular, we show that, when m goes to
infinity while n is fixed (m and n being respectively the number of artificial
data-points, and actual data-points), the two estimators are asymptotically
equivalent. Conversely, we prove that, when the artificial data-points are IID,
and when n goes to infinity while m/n converges to a positive constant, the
asymptotic variance of a NCE estimator is always smaller than the asymptotic
variance of the corresponding MC-MLE estimator. We illustrate the variance

complex and diverse, characterized by bursts of star formation. Overall, first
galaxies spend 70% of their time in SF bursts. A sample of 1000 of these bursts
indicates that the typical burst at z=6 has a specific SFR (sSFR) maximum of
5-15 Gyr^-1 with an effective width of ~100 Myr, one tenth of the age of the

high sSFR maxima of 20-30 Gyr^-1 and significantly shorter timescales of ~40-80
Myr. This diversity of bursts sets the mean and the mass-dependent scatter of
the star-forming main sequence. This scatter is driven by a population of
low-mass, Ms < 10^8 Msun, quiescent galaxies. The mean sSFR and the burst
maximum at fixed mass increase with redshift, with the later always being a

an effective (reduced) gauge field propagating with a fractional power of the

the model. In particular, in relation with the ultra-relativistic limit of
graphene, we straightforwardly recover the results for both the interaction

conditions. On the contrary, humans typically have a broad range of screwing
experiences and sensations throughout their lives, and we conducted an
experiment to find these haptic patterns. Results show that people apply axial
force to the screws to avoid screwdriver slippage (cam-outs), which is one of
the key problems during screwing and unscrewing, and this axial force is
proportional to the torque which is required for screwing. We have found that
type of the screw head influences the amount of axial force applied. Using this
knowledge an unscrewing robot for the smart disassembly factory RecyBot is
developed, and experiments confirm the optimality of the strategy, used by
humans. Finally, a methodology for robust unscrewing algorithm design is
presented as a generalization of the findings. It can seriously speed up the

of titanium nanoparticles by sputtering. This oxygen supply can arise from a
high background pressure in the vacuum system or from a purposely supplied gas.
The supply of oxygen makes it difficult to grow metallic nanoparticles of
titanium and can cause process problems by reacting with the target. We here
report that growth of titanium nanoparticles in the metallic hexagonal titanium
({\alpha}Ti) phase is possible using a pulsed hollow cathode sputter plasma and
adding a high partial pressure of helium to the process instead of trace
amounts of oxygen. The helium cools the process gas in which the nanoparticles
nucleate. This is important both for the first dimer formation and the
continued growth to a thermodynamically stable size. The parameter region where
the synthesis of nanoparticles is possible is mapped out experimentally and the
theory of the physical processes behind this process window is outlined. A
pressure limit below which no nanoparticles were produced was found at 200 Pa,
and could be attributed to a low dimer formation rate, mainly caused by a more
rapid dilution of the growth material. Nanoparticle production also disappeared
at argon gas flows above 25 sccm. In this case the main reason was identified
as a gas temperature increase within the nucleation zone, giving a too high
evaporation rate from nanoparticles (clusters) in the stage of growth from
dimers to stable nuclei. These two mechanisms are in depth explored in a
companion paper [1]. A process stability limit was also found at low argon gas
partial pressures, and could be attributed to a transition from a hollow
cathode discharge to a glow discharge.

rotational speed is taken high enough as to considerably distort the initial

found that when helium ignition is located far from the spinning axis the
detonation fronts converge asynchronically at the antipodes of the igniting

most probable outcome. The detonation of the core gives rise to a strong
explosion, matching many of the basic observational constraints of Type Ia
Supernova. We conclude that the Double Detonation mechanism also works when the

to propose a composite ranking method while keeping a close correlation with

enhances the joint ranking with minimum view-specific ranking loss, so that it
can achieve the maximum global view agreements in a single optimization

systems involving point-like charges of low valencies. The inclusion of
fluctuation corrections beyond the mean-field approach typically requires the
application of loop expansions around a mean-field solution for the
electrostatic potential \(\phi({\bf r})\), or sophisticated variational
approaches. Recently, Poisson-Boltzmann theory has been recast, via a Legendre
transform, as a mean-field theory involving the dielectric displacement field
\({\bf D}({\bf r})\). In this paper we consider the path integral formulation
of the dual theory. Exploiting the transformation between \(\phi\) and \({\bf

field and provide a strategy for precise numerical computations of free
energies beyond the leading order.

the set $G$. The (abstract) holomorph of $G$ is the natural semidirect product
$\Aut(G) G$. We will write $\Hol(G)$ for the normalizer of the image in $S(G)$
of the right regular representation of $G$, \begin{equation*}

if $N$ is any regular subgroup of $S(G)$, then $N_{S(G)}(N)$ is isomorphic to
the holomorph of $N$.
  G.A.~Miller has shown that the group \begin{equation*}
  T(G) = N_{S(G)}(\Hol(G))/\Hol(G) \end{equation*} acts regularly on the set of
the regular subgroups $N$ of $S(G)$ which are isomorphic to $G$, and have the

  If $G$ is non-abelian, inversion on $G$ yields an involution in $T(G)$. Other
non-abelian regular subgroups $N$ of $S(G)$ having the same holomorph as $G$
yield (other) involutions in $T(G)$. In the cases studied in the literature,
$T(G)$ turns out to be a finite $2$-group, which is often elementary abelian.
  In this paper we exhibit an example of a finite $p$-group $\Gp$ of class $2$,
for $p > 2$ a prime, which is the smallest $p$-group such that $T(\Gp)$ is
non-abelian, and not a $2$-group. Moreover, $T(\Gp)$ is not generated by
involutions when $p > 3$.
  More generally, we develop some aspects of a theory of $T(G)$ for $G$ a
finite $p$-group of class $2$, for $p > 2$. In particular, we show that for
such a group $G$ there is an element of order $p-1$ in $T(G)$, and exhibit
examples where $\Size{T(G)} = p - 1$, and others where $T(G)$ contains a large
elementary abelian $p$-subgroup.

sputter plasma has been believed to be essentially impossible. The addition of
impurities, such as oxygen or water, facilitates this and allows the growth of
nanoparticles. However, it seems that this route requires so high oxygen
densities that metallic nanoparticles in the hexagonal aTi-phase cannot be
synthesized. Here we present a model which explains results for the nucleation
and growth of titanium nanoparticles in the absent of reactive impurities. In
these experiments, a high partial pressure of helium gas was added which
increased the cooling rate of the process gas in the region where nucleation
occurred. This is important for two reasons. First, a reduced gas temperature
enhances Ti2 dimer formation mainly because a lower gas temperature gives a
higher gas density, which reduces the dilution of the Ti vapor through
diffusion. The same effect can be achieved by increasing the gas pressure.
Second, a reduced gas temperature has a ""more than exponential"" effect in
lowering the rate of atom evaporation from the nanoparticles during their
growth from a dimer to size where they are thermodynamically stable, r*. We
show that this early stage evaporation is not possible to model as a
thermodynamical equilibrium. Instead, the single-event nature of the
evaporation process has to be considered. This leads, counter intuitively, to
an evaporation probability from nanoparticles that is exactly zero below a
critical nanoparticle temperature that is size-dependent. Together, the
mechanisms described above explain two experimentally found limits for
nucleation in an oxygen-free environment. First, there is a lower limit to the
pressure for dimer formation. Second, there is an upper limit to the gas
temperature above which evaporation makes the further growth to stable nuclei
impossible.

theoretical computer science and mathematical phylogenetics. For example, it
has long been known that under the Yule model, a pure birth process, imbalanced
trees are more likely than balanced ones. Also, concerning ordered search
trees, more balanced ones allow for more efficient data structuring than
imbalanced ones. Therefore, different methods to measure the balance of trees
were introduced. The Sackin index is one of the most frequently used measures
for this purpose. In many contexts, statements about the minimal and maximal
values of this index have been discussed, but formal proofs have only been
provided for some of them, and only in the context of ordered binary (search)
trees, not for general rooted trees. Moreover, while the number of trees with
maximal Sackin index as well as the number of trees with minimal Sackin index
when the number of leaves is a power of 2 are relatively easy to understand,
the number of trees with minimal Sackin index for all other numbers of leaves
has been completely unknown. In this manuscript, we extend the findings on
trees with minimal and maximal Sackin indices from the literature on ordered
trees and subsequently use our results to provide formulas to explicitly
calculate the numbers of such trees. We also extend previous studies by
analyzing the case when the underlying trees need not be binary. Finally, we
use our results to contribute both to the phylogenetic as well as the computer
scientific literature by using the new findings on Sackin minimal and maximal
trees in order to derive formulas to calculate the number of both minimal and
maximal phylogenetic trees as well as minimal and maximal ordered trees both in

transitions of the space. The smooth 4-dimensional spacetime of the model
admits topological transitions of its 3-dimensional slices. The whole approach
is inspired by a class of exotic smoothness structure on
$S^{3}\times\mathbb{R}$. In particular, this class of smoothness structures
induces two topological transitions. Then, we are able to calculate the energy
scales as associated to these topological transitions. For the first transition
we will get the value of the GUT scale and the energy of the second transition
is at the electroweak scale. The topology of the exotic $S^{3}\times\mathbb{R}$
determines both, the energy of the scales by certain topological invariants,
and the existence of the right-handed sterile neutrino. It is the input for the
seesaw mechanism. Secondly, based on this model, we are able to calculate the
neutrino masses which are in a very good agreement with experiments. Finally,
we will speculate, again based on topology, why there are three generations of
neutrinos and an asymmetry between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos.

density of cosmic rays (CRs) and the energy density of the magnetic field
cannot be sustained in supernova remnants (SNRs). However, our 3D hydrodynamic
supercomputer simulations, coupled with a non-linear diffusive shock
acceleration model (NLDSA), provide evidence that eqp may be established at the
end of the Sedov phase of evolution in which most SNRs spend the longest
portions of their lives. We introduce term ""constant partition"" for any
constant ratio between the CR energy density and the energy density of magnetic
field in an SNR, while term ""equipartition"" should be reserved for the case of
approximately the same values of the energy density (also, it is {constant
partition} in the order of magnitude) of ultrarelativistic electrons only (or
CRs in total) and the energy density of magnetic field. Our simulations suggest
that this approximate constant partition does exist in all but the youngest
SNRs. We speculate that since evolved SNRs at the end of the Sedov phase of
evolution can reach eqp between CRs and magnetic fields, they may be
responsible for initializing this type of eqp in the interstellar medium.
Additionally, we show that eqp between the electron component of CRs and
magnetic field may be used for calculating the magnetic field strength directly
from observations of synchrotron emission from SNRs. The values of magnetic
field strengths in SNRs given here are approximately 2.5 times lower than
values calculated by Arbutina et al. (2012, 2013).

conversion in the electron diffusion region of asymmetric magnetic
reconnection. To do so, we consider the terms in Poynting's theorem. In a
steady state there is a perfect balance between the divergence of the
electromagnetic energy flux $\nabla \cdot \vec{S}$ and the conversion between
electromagnetic field and particle energy $\vec{J} \cdot \vec{E}$. This energy
balance is demonstrated with a particle-in-cell simulation of reconnection. We
also evaluate each of the terms in Poynting's theorem during an observation of
a magnetopause reconnection region by Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS). We take
the equivalence of both sides of Poynting's theorem as an indication that the
errors associated with the approximation of each term with MMS data are small.
We find that, for this event, balance between
$\vec{J}\cdot\vec{E}=-\nabla\cdot\vec{S}$ is only achieved for a small fraction
of the energy conversion region at/near the X-point. Magnetic energy was
rapidly accumulating on either side of the current sheet at roughly three times
the predicted energy conversion rate. Furthermore, we find that while
$\vec{J}\cdot\vec{E}>0$ and $\nabla\cdot\vec{S}<0$ are observed, as is expected
for reconnection, the energy accumulation is driven by the overcompensation for
$\vec{J}\cdot\vec{E}$ by $-\nabla\cdot\vec{S}>\vec{J}\cdot\vec{E}$. We note
that due to the assumptions necessary to do this calculation, the accurate
evaluation of $\nabla\cdot\vec{S}$ may not be possible for every MMS-observed
reconnection event; but if possible, this is a simple approach to determine if
reconnection is or is not in a steady-state.

  Interferometry","45 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fourier Transform Interferometry (FTI) is an appealing Hyperspectral (HS)
imaging modality for many applications demanding high spectral resolution,
e.g., in fluorescence microscopy. However, the effective resolution of FTI is
limited by the durability of biological elements when exposed to illuminating
light. Overexposed elements are subject to photo-bleaching and become unable to
fluoresce. In this context, the acquisition of biological HS volumes based on
sampling the Optical Path Difference (OPD) axis at Nyquist rate leads to
unpleasant trade-offs between spectral resolution, quality of the HS volume,
and light exposure intensity. We propose two variants of the FTI imager, i.e.,
Coded Illumination-FTI (CI-FTI) and Structured Illumination FTI (SI-FTI), based
on the theory of compressive sensing (CS). These schemes efficiently modulate
light exposure temporally (in CI-FTI) or spatiotemporally (in SI-FTI).
Leveraging a variable density sampling strategy recently introduced in CS, we
provide near-optimal illumination strategies, so that the light exposure
imposed on a biological specimen is minimized while the spectral resolution is
preserved. Our analysis focuses on two criteria: (i) a trade-off between
exposure intensity and the quality of the reconstructed HS volume for a given
spectral resolution; (ii) maximizing HS volume quality for a fixed spectral
resolution and constrained exposure budget. Our contributions can be adapted to
an FTI imager without hardware modifications. The reconstruction of HS volumes
from CS-FTI measurements relies on an $l_1$-norm minimization problem promoting
a spatiospectral sparsity prior. Numerically, we support the proposed methods
on synthetic data and simulated CS measurements (from actual FTI measurements)
under various scenarios. In particular, the biological HS volumes can be
reconstructed with a three-to-ten-fold reduction in the light exposure.

which features $s$-block-sparse signals with $\sigma$-sparse blocks. For a
large class of algorithms recovery guarantees can be derived based on the
restricted isometry property (RIP) of the measurement matrix and model-based
variants thereof. We show that given two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$

$\mathbf{A}\otimes\mathbf{B}$ has two-level $(s,\sigma)$-hierarchically sparse
RIP (HiRIP). This result can be recursively generalized to signals with
multiple hierarchical sparsity levels and measurements with multiple Kronecker
product factors. As a corollary we establish the efficient reconstruction of
hierarchical sparse signals from Kronecker product measurements using the HiHTP
algorithm. We argue that Kronecker product measurement matrices allow to design
large practical compressed sensing systems that are deterministically certified

of all DFAs reaching this bound was only given for $n \leq 5$, and with bounds

  For PFAs (partial automata) on $\leq 7$ states we do a similar analysis as

$(n-1)^2$ for $n \geq 4$. Where DFAs with long synchronization typically have
very few symbols, for PFAs we observe that more symbols may increase the

  We give series of PFAs on two and three symbols, reaching the maximal
possible length for some small values of $n$. For $n=6,7,8,9$, the construction
on two symbols is the unique one reaching the maximal length. For both series
the growth is faster than $(n-1)^2$, although still quadratic.
  Based on string rewriting, for arbitrary size we construct a PFA on three

significantly better bounds than earlier exponential constructions. We give a
transformation of this PFA to a PFA on two symbols keeping exponential shortest

images of actors from freely available sources on the web, providing a form of
partial supervision for this task. In using images of actors to recognize
characters, we make the following three contributions: (i) We demonstrate that
an automated semi-supervised learning approach is able to adapt from the
actor's face to the character's face, including the face context of the hair;
(ii) By building voice models for every character, we provide a bridge between
frontal faces (for which there is plenty of actor-level supervision) and
profile (for which there is very little or none); and (iii) by combining face
context and speaker identification, we are able to identify characters with
partially occluded faces and extreme facial poses. Results are presented on the
TV series 'Sherlock' and the feature film 'Casablanca'. We achieve the
state-of-the-art on the Casablanca benchmark, surpassing previous methods that
have used the stronger supervision available from transcripts.

  Neural Networks","Accepted at WACV 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently there has been a lot of work on pruning filters from deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the intention of reducing
computations. The key idea is to rank the filters based on a certain criterion
(say, $l_1$-norm, average percentage of zeros, etc) and retain only the top
ranked filters. Once the low scoring filters are pruned away the remainder of
the network is fine tuned and is shown to give performance comparable to the
original unpruned network. In this work, we report experiments which suggest
that the comparable performance of the pruned network is not due to the
specific criterion chosen but due to the inherent plasticity of deep neural
networks which allows them to recover from the loss of pruned filters once the
rest of the filters are fine-tuned. Specifically, we show counter-intuitive
results wherein by randomly pruning 25-50\% filters from deep CNNs we are able
to obtain the same performance as obtained by using state of the art pruning
methods. We empirically validate our claims by doing an exhaustive evaluation
with VGG-16 and ResNet-50. Further, we also evaluate a real world scenario
where a CNN trained on all 1000 ImageNet classes needs to be tested on only a
small set of classes at test time (say, only animals). We create a new
benchmark dataset from ImageNet to evaluate such class specific pruning and
show that even here a random pruning strategy gives close to state of the art
performance. Lastly, unlike existing approaches which mainly focus on the task
of image classification, in this work we also report results on object
detection. We show that using a simple random pruning strategy we can achieve
significant speed up in object detection (74$\%$ improvement in fps) while
retaining the same accuracy as that of the original Faster RCNN model.

applied RAPTOR to study accretion models of supermassive black holes,
performing time-dependent radiative transfer through general relativistic
magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations and investigating the expected
observational differences between the so-called fast-light and slow-light
paradigms. Using RAPTOR to produce synthetic images and light curves of a GRMHD
model of an accreting black hole, we find that the relative difference between
fast-light and slow-light light curves is less than 5%. Using two distinct
radiative-transfer codes to process the same data, we find integrated flux
densities with a relative difference less than 0.01%. For two-dimensional GRMHD
models, such as those examined in this paper, the fast-light approximation
suffices as long as errors of a few percent are acceptable. The convergence of
the results of two different codes demonstrates that they are, at a minimum,

into a topologically stable $Z$-string. This is in contrast to the SM in which
$Z$-strings are non-topological and are unstable in the realistic parameter

optimized for e+e- collisions; the photon collider (gamma-gamma and

diphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the
construction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision
option, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In
this paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC
technical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough
space for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,
the crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result
from multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with
the opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector
field. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.
In this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as
well as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable
reduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity. It is shown that the best solution is
to increase the laser wavelength from the current 1 \mum (which is optimal for
2E=500 GeV) to 2 \mum as this makes possible achieving high gamma-gamma
luminosities at a crossing angle of 20 mrad, which is also quite comfortable
for e+e- collisions, does not cause any degradation of the e+e- luminosity and
opens the possibility for a more energetic future collider in the same tunnel
(e.g., CLIC). Moreover, the 2 \mum wavelength is optimal for a 2E = 1 TeV
collider, e.g., a possible ILC energy upgrade. Please consider this paper an
appeal to increase the ILC crossing angle from 14 to 20 mrad.

  network of a small open economy",,,,,"q-fin.RM physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To a large extent, the systemic importance of financial institutions is
related to the topology of financial liability networks. In this work we
reconstruct and analyze the - to our knowledge - largest financial network that
has been studied up to now. This financial liability network consists of 51,980
firms and 796 banks. It represents 80.2% of total liabilities towards banks by
firms and all interbank liabilities from the entire Austrian banking system. We
find that firms contribute to systemic risk in similar ways as banks do. In
particular, we identify several medium-sized banks and firms with total assets
below 1 bln. EUR that are systemically important in the entire financial
network. We show that the notion of systemically important financial
institutions (SIFIs) or global and domestic systemically important banks
(G-SIBs or D-SIBs) can be straightforwardly extended to firms. We find that
firms introduce slightly more systemic risk than banks. In Austria in 2008, the
total systemic risk of the interbank network amounts to only 29% of the total
systemic risk of the entire financial network, consisting of firms and banks.

However, regardless of cost assessment complexities, accurate cost models are
required for successful remanufacturing operation management. In this paper,
joint effects of core quality condition, return quantity, and timing on
remanufacturing cost under normal and extreme return conditions is analyzed. To
conduct this analysis, a novel multivariate stochastic model called Stochastic
Cost of Remanufacturing Model (SCoRM) is developed. In building SCoRM, a Hybrid
Pareto Distribution (HPD), Bernoulli process, and a polynomial cost function
are employed. It is discussed that core return process can be characterized as
a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC). In a case study, SCoRM is applied to
assess remanufacturing costs of steam traps of a chemical complex. Its accuracy
analyzed and variations of SCoRM in predictive tasks assessed by bootstrapping
technique. Through this variation analysis the best and worst cost scenarios
determined. Finally, to generate comparative insights regarding predictive
performance of SCoRM, the model is compared to artificial neural network,
support vector machine, generalized additive model, and random forest
algorithms. Results indicate that SCoRM can be efficiently utilized to analyze
remanufacturing cost. Keywords: Remanufacturing, extreme value theory, hybrid

traffic speed, jam factors (a traffic congestion indicator), and events
collected over a year from Nashville, TN to train a multi-layered deep neural
network. The traffic dataset contains over 900 million data records. The
network is thereafter used to classify the real-time data and identify
anomalous operations. Compared with traditional approaches of using statistical
or machine learning techniques, our model reaches an accuracy of 98.73 percent
when identifying traffic congestion caused by football games. Our approach
first encodes the traffic across a region as a scaled image. After that the
image data from different timestamps is fused with event- and time-related
data. Then a crossover operator is used as a data augmentation method to
generate training datasets with more balanced classes. Finally, we use the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to tune the sensitivity of the
classifier. We present the analysis of the training time and the inference time
separately.

related to the early fragmentation and collapse processes is largely unexplored

earliest evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation. Methods: The Atacama
Large Millimeter Array is used at 1.3mm wavelength in full polarization mode to
study the polarized emission and by that the magnetic field morphologies and
strengths of the high-mass starless region IRDC18310-4. Results: The polarized
emission is clearly detected in four sub-cores of the region. In general it
shows a smooth distribution, also along elongated cores. Estimating the
magnetic field strength via the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method and following
a structure function analysis, we find comparably large magnetic field
strengths between ~0.6 and 3.7mG. Comparing the data to spectral line
observations, the turbulent-to-magnetic energy ratio is low, indicating that
turbulence does not significantly contribute to the stability of the gas clump.
A mass-to-flux ratio around the critical value 1.0 - depending on column
density - indicates that the region starts to collapse which is consistent with
the previous spectral line analysis of the region. Conclusions: While this
high-mass region is collapsing and thus at the verge of star formation, the
high magnetic field values and the smooth spatial structure indicate that the
magnetic field is important for the fragmentation and collapse process. This
single case study can only be the starting point for larger sample studies of
magnetic fields at the onset of star formation.

fraction of the system ceases to function and collapses. Systemic risk can
propagate through different mechanisms and channels of contagion. One important
form of financial contagion arises from indirect interconnections between
financial institutions mediated by financial markets. This indirect
interconnection occurs when financial institutions invest in common assets and
is referred to as overlapping portfolios. In this work we quantify systemic
risk from indirect interconnections between financial institutions. Having
complete information of security holdings of major Mexican financial
intermediaries and the ability to uniquely identify securities in their
portfolios, allows us to represent the Mexican financial system as a bipartite
network of securities and financial institutions. This makes it possible to
quantify systemic risk arising from overlapping portfolios. We show that
focusing only on direct exposures underestimates total systemic risk levels by
up to 50%. By representing the financial system as a multi-layer network of
direct exposures (default contagion) and indirect exposures (overlapping
portfolios) we estimate the mutual influence of different channels of
contagion. The method presented here is the first objective data-driven
quantification of systemic risk on national scales that includes overlapping
portfolios.

  Recurrent Neural Networks","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1703.09752",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intrusion detection for computer network systems has been becoming one of the
most critical tasks for network administrators today. It has an important role
for organizations, governments and our society due to the valuable resources
hosted on computer networks. Traditional misuse detection strategies are unable
to detect new and unknown intrusion types. In contrast, anomaly detection in
network security aims to distinguish between illegal or malicious events and
normal behavior of network systems. Anomaly detection can be considered as a
classification problem where it builds models of normal network behavior, of
which it uses to detect new patterns that significantly deviate from the model.
Most of the current approaches on anomaly detection is based on the learning of
normal behavior and anomalous actions. They do not include memory that is they
do not take into account previous events classify new ones. In this paper, we
propose a one class collective anomaly detection model based on neural network
learning. Normally a Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN)
is trained only on normal data, and it is capable of predicting several time
steps ahead of an input. In our approach, a LSTM RNN is trained on normal time
series data before performing a prediction for each time step. Instead of
considering each time-step separately, the observation of prediction errors
from a certain number of time-steps is now proposed as a new idea for detecting
collective anomalies. The prediction errors of a certain number of the latest
time-steps above a threshold will indicate a collective anomaly. The model is
evaluated on a time series version of the KDD 1999 dataset. The experiments
demonstrate that the proposed model is capable to detect collective anomaly
efficiently

solving high dimensional planning problems in near real-time remains a
challenge. Applications include hyper-redundant manipulators, snake-like and
humanoid robots. Based on the intuition that many of these problem instances do
not require the robots to exercise every degree of freedom independently, we
introduce an enhancement to popular sampling-based planning algorithms aimed at
circumventing the exponential dependence on dimensionality. We propose
beginning the search in a lower dimensional subspace of the configuration space
in the hopes that a simple solution will be found quickly. After a certain
number of samples are generated, if no solution is found, we increase the
dimension of the search subspace by one and continue sampling in the higher
dimensional subspace. In the worst case, the search subspace expands to include
the full configuration space - making the completeness properties identical to
the underlying sampling-based planer. Our experiments comparing the enhanced
and traditional version of RRT, RRT-Connect, and BidirectionalT-RRT on both a
planar hyper-redundant manipulator and the Baxter humanoid robot indicate that
a solution is typically found much faster using this approach and the run time
appears to be less sensitive to the dimension of the full configuration space.
We explore important implementation issues in the sampling process and discuss
its limitations.

mechanics from the viewpoint of superposition and coherence theory. It is
argued that $\cal PT$-symmetric quantum systems are endowed with stationary
superposition or superposition-free properties. A physical interpretation of
$\eta$-inner product in $\mathbb C^2$ is given through the Stokes parameters,
showing the difference between broken and unbroken $\cal PT$-symmetric quantum
systems.

using the Nordic Optical Telescope, we identify 72 quasars out of 99 candidates
targeted. We measure the spectroscopic redshifts based on characteristic, broad
emission lines present in the spectra. Of these 72 quasars, 64 and 48 objects
are at sufficiently high redshift (z>0.6 and z>1.4) to be used for the L-band

language from scratch based on two language use cases: sentence-directed
navigation and question answering. It learns simultaneously the visual
representations of the world, the language, and the action control. By
disentangling language grounding from other computational routines and sharing
a concept detection function between language grounding and prediction, the
agent reliably interpolates and extrapolates to interpret sentences that
contain new word combinations or new words missing from training sentences. The
new words are transferred from the answers of language prediction. Such a
language ability is trained and evaluated on a population of over 1.6 million
distinct sentences consisting of 119 object words, 8 color words, 9
spatial-relation words, and 50 grammatical words. The proposed model
significantly outperforms five comparison methods for interpreting zero-shot

train detectors that perform well without any knowledge of the underlying
channel models. Moreover, when the channel model is known, we demonstrate that
it is possible to train detectors that do not require channel state information
(CSI). In particular, a technique we call a sliding bidirectional recurrent
neural network (SBRNN) is proposed for detection where, after training, the
detector estimates the data in real-time as the signal stream arrives at the
receiver. We evaluate this algorithm, as well as other neural network (NN)
architectures, using the Poisson channel model, which is applicable to both
optical and molecular communication systems. In addition, we also evaluate the
performance of this detection method applied to data sent over a molecular
communication platform, where the channel model is difficult to model
analytically. We show that SBRNN is computationally efficient, and can perform
detection under various channel conditions without knowing the underlying
channel model. We also demonstrate that the bit error rate (BER) performance of
the proposed SBRNN detector is better than that of a Viterbi detector with
imperfect CSI as well as that of other NN detectors that have been previously
proposed. Finally, we show that the SBRNN can perform well in rapidly changing
channels, where the coherence time is on the order of a single symbol duration.

lays the foundation for pervasive personal applications. However, low-cost
inertial sensors, as commonly found in smartphones, are plagued by bias and
noise, which leads to unbounded growth in error when accelerations are double
integrated to obtain displacement. Small errors in state estimation propagate
to make odometry virtually unusable in a matter of seconds. We propose to break
the cycle of continuous integration, and instead segment inertial data into
independent windows. The challenge becomes estimating the latent states of each
window, such as velocity and orientation, as these are not directly observable
from sensor data. We demonstrate how to formulate this as an optimization
problem, and show how deep recurrent neural networks can yield highly accurate
trajectories, outperforming state-of-the-art shallow techniques, on a wide
range of tests and attachments. In particular, we demonstrate that IONet can
generalize to estimate odometry for non-periodic motion, such as a shopping
trolley or baby-stroller, an extremely challenging task for existing
techniques.
