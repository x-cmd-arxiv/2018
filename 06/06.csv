  to Sex Classification with Brain Connectivity",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) allow to apply traditional convolution
operations in non-Euclidean domains, where data are commonly modelled as
irregular graphs. Medical imaging and, in particular, neuroscience studies
often rely on such graph representations, with brain connectivity networks
being a characteristic example, while ultimately seeking the locus of
phenotypic or disease-related differences in the brain. These regions of
interest (ROIs) are, then, considered to be closely associated with function
and/or behaviour. Driven by this, we explore GCNs for the task of ROI
identification and propose a visual attribution method based on class
activation mapping. By undertaking a sex classification task as proof of
concept, we show that this method can be used to identify salient nodes (brain
regions) without prior node labels. Based on experiments conducted on
neuroimaging data of more than 5000 participants from UK Biobank, we
demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in highlighting reproducible
regions across individuals. We further evaluate the neurobiological relevance
of the identified regions based on evidence from large-scale UK Biobank
studies.

to excavate more interesting aspects of the 4-particle amplituhedron for a
better understanding of the 4-particle integrand of planar N=4 SYM to all loop
orders, from the perspective of positive geometry. At 3-loop order, we
introduce a much more refined dissection of the amplituhedron to understand its
essential structure and maximally simplify its direct calculation, by fully
utilizing its symmetry as well as the efficient Mondrian way for reorganizing
all contributing pieces. Although significantly improved, this approach
immediately encounters its technical bottleneck at 4-loop. Still, we manage to
alleviate this difficulty by imitating the traditional (generalized) unitarity
cuts, which is to use the so-called positive cuts. Given a basis of dual
conformally invariant (DCI) loop integrals, we can figure out the coefficient
of each DCI topology using its dlog form via positivity conditions. Explicit
examples include all 2+5 non-rung-rule topologies at 4- and 5-loop
respectively. These results remarkably agree with previous knowledge, which
confirms the validity of amplituhedron up to 5-loop and develops a new approach
of determining the coefficient of each distinct DCI loop integral.

another Dirichlet distribution whose parameters are set by the continuous

addressed. This object is the most luminous protostar in $\rho$ Oph E molecular
cloud, and is surrounded by many Young Stellar Objects distant only a few
arcminutes. In addition, other two brightness BV stars (S1 and HD 147889)
enhance the external irradiation in Elias 29. This study was carried out by
using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC-3D assuming an internal and
external irradiation. As result, we found that HD 147889 dominates the ISRF,
instead of the closest protostars, and contributes to enhance the external
irradiation in 44 times the standard value. Furthermore, remarkable effects are
observed in FIR spectrum, as well as in near-IR image. Additionally, the
snowline positions of volatile compounds, such as CO, O$_2$, N$_2$ and CH$_4$
are redefined to a toroidal-shaped morphology in the envelope, with low FUV
flux (10$^{-7}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). In such scenario, the formation of

leading-order post-Newtonian results in a new expression of the centrifugal
radius. TEOBResumS is compared to 135 SpEC and 19 BAM BBH waveforms. The
maximum unfaithfulness to SpEC data $\bar{F}$ -- at design Advanced-LIGO

outlier that grazes the $7.1 \times 10^{-3}$ level. When compared to BAM data,
$\bar{F}$ is smaller than $0.01$ except for a single outlier in one of the
corners of the NR-covered parameter space, that reaches the $0.052$
level.TEOBResumS is also compatible, up to merger, to high end NR waveforms
from binary neutron stars with spin effects and reduced initial eccentricity

demonstrate its use by analyzing the publicly available data for GW150914.

by demonstrating significant performance gains in three different experimental
setups: (1) We train an agent able to control more than 700 actions in a
challenging 3D first-person task; using our method to progress through an
action-space curriculum we achieve both faster training and better final
performance than one obtains using traditional methods. (2) We further show

This paper includes a description of the methodology, advantages, and the first
results of the EM2D method applied to ELGs in FIGS. The advantage of 2D
emission line measurements includes significant improvement of galaxy redshift
measurements, approaching the level of accuracy seen in
high-spectral-resolution data, but with greater efficiency; and the ability to
identify and measure the properties of multiple sites of star-formation and
over scales of $\sim$ 1 kpc within individual galaxies out to z $\sim$ 4. The
EM2D method also significantly improves the reliability of high-redshift

high efficiency of space-based grism observations, EM2D provides a noteworthy
improvement on the physical parameters that can be extracted from grism
observations.

smooth monotone loss functions, optimized on linearly separable data. Previous
works assumed either a vanishing learning rate, iterate averaging, or loss
assumptions that do not hold for monotone loss functions used for
classification, such as the logistic loss. We prove our result on a fixed
dataset, both for sampling with or without replacement. Furthermore, for
logistic loss (and similar exponentially-tailed losses), we prove that with SGD
the weight vector converges in direction to the $L_2$ max margin vector as
$O(1/\log(t))$ for almost all separable datasets, and the loss converges as
$O(1/t)$ - similarly to gradient descent. Lastly, we examine the case of a
fixed learning rate proportional to the minibatch size. We prove that in this
case, the asymptotic convergence rate of SGD (with replacement) does not depend
on the minibatch size in terms of epochs, if the support vectors span the data.
These results may suggest an explanation to similar behaviors observed in deep
networks, when trained with SGD.

approach to study turbulent flows, ODTLES (One-Dimensional Turbulence Large
Eddy Simulation). From a methodological point of view, ODTLES is an approach in
between Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and averaged/filtered approaches
like RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) or LES (Large Eddy Simulations). In
ODTLES, a set of 1D ODT models is embedded in a coarse grained 3D LES. On the
ODT scale, the turbulent advection is modeled as a sequence of stochastic eddy
events, also known as triplet maps, while the other (deterministic) terms are
fully resolved in space (along the ODT- line) and time. Schmidt et al. first
(2008) introduced ODTLES and Gonzalez et al. (2011) applied the model for a
variety of wall-bounded flow problems. Although the results were notable for a
first proof of concept, the numerical methods used are subject to debate. First
of all, an unstable discretization for the large scale 3D advective terms was
used as shown by Glawe (2013). The scheme can be stabilized by reducing the CFL
number for the explicitly discretized LES terms to the order of the small scale
ODT time step, but this of course reduces the advantage of the ODTLES
multi-scale approach. The stochastic ODT eddies were also allowed to overlap
two LES cells introducing an artificial smoothing (stabilizing) effect. Glawe
(2013) limited the overlap consistently to one LES cell and used a stable Runge
Kutta (RK) discretization, however maintaining the low CFL number problem. In
this paper we adapt a new implicit/explicit (IMEX) time scheme to ODTLES in
order to remedy the small CFL number issue.

of the combining network model specific analog receiver architectures, such as
single antenna selection, sign quantization of the antenna outputs or linear
processing of the outputs. An interesting connection between the capacity of
this channel and a constrained sphere packing problem in which unit spheres are
packed in a hyperplane arrangement is shown. From a high-level perspective,
this follows from the fact that each threshold quantizer can be viewed as a
hyperplane partitioning the transmitter signal space. Accordingly, the output
of the set of quantizers corresponds to the possible regions induced by the
hyperplane arrangement corresponding to the channel realization and receiver
configuration. This connection provides a number of important insights into the
design of quantization architectures for MIMO receivers; for instance, it shows
that for a given number of quantizers, choosing configurations which induce a
larger number of partitions can lead to higher rates.

a rectangular lattice have a unique minimum, and in that case the supercritical
fraction of the total mass condenses to the ground state of the energy
function. We prove that for any sufficiently large lattice size this also
happens in the case of multiple global minima, although the precise

one can identify a bounded number of degrees of freedom forming the condensate

measure where the condensate and normal fluid degrees of freedom become
independent random variables, and the normal fluid part converges to the
critical Gaussian free field. The proof is based on a construction of a
suitable coupling between the two measures, proving that their Wasserstein

material has been detected primarily on the leading hemispheres of the outer
moons, Titania and Oberon. Furthermore, detected H2O ice bands are stronger on
the leading hemispheres of the classical satellites, and the leading/trailing
asymmetry in H2O ice band strengths decreases with distance from Uranus. We
hypothesize that the observed distribution of red material and trends in H2O
ice band strengths results from infalling dust from Uranian irregular
satellites. These dust particles migrate inward on slowly decaying orbits,
eventually reaching the classical satellite zone, where they collide primarily
with the outer moons. The latitudinal distribution of dust swept up by these
moons should be fairly even across their southern and northern hemispheres.
However, red material has only been detected over the southern hemispheres of
these moons (subsolar latitude 81 S). Consequently, to test whether irregular
satellite dust impacts drive the observed enhancement in reddening, we have
gathered new ground-based data of the now observable northern hemispheres of
these moons (sub-observer latitudes, 17 to 35 N). Our results and analyses
indicate that longitudinal and planetocentric trends in reddening and H2O ice
band strengths are broadly consistent across both southern and northern
latitudes of these moons, thereby supporting our hypothesis. Utilizing a suite

agent detected on these moons, finding that both complex organics and amorphous
pyroxene match the spectral slopes of our data. We also present spectra that

fine-tune the stepsize schedule. Yet, the theoretical guarantees to date for
AdaGrad are for online and convex optimization. We bridge this gap by providing
theoretical guarantees for the convergence of AdaGrad for smooth, nonconvex
functions. We show that the norm version of AdaGrad (AdaGrad-Norm) converges to
a stationary point at the $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ rate in the
stochastic setting, and at the optimal $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ rate in the batch
(non-stochastic) setting -- in this sense, our convergence guarantees are
'sharp'. In particular, the convergence of AdaGrad-Norm is robust to the choice
of all hyper-parameters of the algorithm, in contrast to stochastic gradient
descent whose convergence depends crucially on tuning the step-size to the
(generally unknown) Lipschitz smoothness constant and level of stochastic noise
on the gradient. Extensive numerical experiments are provided to corroborate
our theory; moreover, the experiments suggest that the robustness of

models to predict neural responses in visual cortex. However, contextual
effects, which are prevalent in neural processing and in perception, are not

In primary visual cortex, neural responses are modulated by stimuli spatially
surrounding the classical receptive field in rich ways. These effects have been
modeled with divisive normalization approaches, including flexible models,
where spatial normalization is recruited only to the degree responses from
center and surround locations are deemed statistically dependent. We propose a
flexible normalization model applied to mid-level representations of deep CNNs
as a tractable way to study contextual normalization mechanisms in mid-level
cortical areas. This approach captures non-trivial spatial dependencies among
mid-level features in CNNs, such as those present in textures and other visual
stimuli, that arise from tiling high order features, geometrically. We expect
that the proposed approach can make predictions about when spatial
normalization might be recruited in mid-level cortical areas. We also expect
this approach to be useful as part of the CNN toolkit, therefore going beyond
more restrictive fixed forms of normalization.

that interleaves planning, acting, and learning in an online setting. In the
most typical application of Dyna, the dynamics model is used to generate
one-step transitions from selected start states from the agent's history, which
are used to update the agent's value function or policy as if they were real
experiences. In this work, one-step Dyna was applied to several games from the
Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). We found that the model-based updates
offered surprisingly little benefit over simply performing more updates with
the agent's existing experience, even when using a perfect model. We
hypothesize that to get the most from planning, the model must be used to
generate unfamiliar experience. To test this, we experimented with the ""shape""
of planning in multiple different concrete instantiations of Dyna, performing
fewer, longer rollouts, rather than many short rollouts. We found that planning
shape has a profound impact on the efficacy of Dyna for both perfect and
learned models. In addition to these findings regarding Dyna in general, our
results represent, to our knowledge, the first time that a learned dynamics
model has been successfully used for planning in the ALE, suggesting that Dyna
may be a viable approach to MBRL in the ALE and other high-dimensional

the cosmic star formation density peak. This work describes the first CO
detection from $1<z<1.4$ star forming cluster galaxies with no reported clear
evidence of AGN. We exploit observations taken with the NOEMA interferometer at
$\sim3$ mm to detect CO(2-1) line emission from the two selected galaxies,
unresolved by our observations. Based on the CO(2-1) spectrum we estimate a
total molecular gas mass $M({\rm H_2})=(2.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4})\times10^{10}$
$M_\odot$ and dust mass $M_{\rm dust}<4.2\times10^8~M_\odot$ for the two
blended sources. The two galaxies have similar stellar masses and a large
relative velocity of $\sim$400 km/s estimated from the CO(2-1) line width.
These findings tend to privilege a scenario where both sources contribute to
the observed CO(2-1). By using the archival Spitzer MIPS flux at 24$\mu$m we
estimate an ${\rm SFR(24\mu m)}=(28^{+12}_{-8})~M_\odot$/yr for each of the two

ratio $0.17\pm0.13$ for each of two sources, separately. Our results are in
overall agreement with those of other distant cluster galaxies. The two target
galaxies have molecular gas mass and depletion time that are marginally
compatible with, but smaller than those of main sequence field galaxies,
suggesting that the molecular gas has not been refueled enough. Higher
resolution and higher frequency observations will enable us to spatially
resolve the two sources and possibly distinguish between different gas

contribute with different signs or phases. Phase unwrapping describes a family
of signal processing techniques in which phase differences between elements of
a time series are integrated to construct non-compact unwrapped phase
differences. By combining phase unwrapping with a cumulant expansion, path
integrals with sign problems arising from phase fluctuations can be
systematically approximated as linear combinations of path integrals without
sign problems. This work explores phase unwrapping in zero-plus-one-dimensional
complex scalar field theory. Results with improved signal-to-noise ratios for
the spectrum of scalar field theory can be obtained from unwrapped phases, but
the size of cumulant expansion truncation errors is found to be undesirably
sensitive to the parameters of the phase unwrapping algorithm employed. It is
argued that this numerical sensitivity arises from discretization artifacts
that become large when phases fluctuate close to singularities of a complex
logarithm in the definition of the unwrapped phase.

Inception, Xception, SqueezeNet and Wide ResNet are based on the designing idea
of having multiple branches and have demonstrated improved performance in many
applications. We show that one cause for such success is due to the fact that
the multi-branch architecture is less non-convex in terms of duality gap. The
duality gap measures the degree of intrinsic non-convexity of an optimization
problem: smaller gap in relative value implies lower degree of intrinsic
non-convexity. The challenge is to quantitatively measure the duality gap of
highly non-convex problems such as deep neural networks. In this work, we
provide strong guarantees of this quantity for two classes of network
architectures. For the neural networks with arbitrary activation functions,
multi-branch architecture and a variant of hinge loss, we show that the duality
gap of both population and empirical risks shrinks to zero as the number of
branches increases. This result sheds light on better understanding the power
of over-parametrization where increasing the network width tends to make the
loss surface less non-convex. For the neural networks with linear activation
function and $\ell_2$ loss, we show that the duality gap of empirical risk is
zero. Our two results work for arbitrary depths and adversarial data, while the
analytical techniques might be of independent interest to non-convex
optimization more broadly. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world

further produce maps of the gas kinematics by forward modeling the hyperfine

coupling $J_\perp$ and the intra-layer Kitaev couplings $K^{x,y,z}$ destroys
the topological spin liquid in favor of a paramagnetic dimer phase. We study
phase diagrams as a function of $J_\perp/K$ and Kitaev coupling anisotropies
using Majorana-fermion mean-field theory, and we employ different expansion
techniques in the limits of small and large $J_\perp/K$. For strongly
anisotropic Kitaev couplings, we derive effective models for the different
layer stackings which we use to discuss the quantum phase transition out of the
Kitaev phase. We find that the phase diagrams depend sensitively on the nature
of the stacking and anisotropy strength. While in some stackings and at strong
anisotropies we find a single transition between the Kitaev and dimer phases,
other stackings are more involved: Most importantly, we prove the existence of
two novel macro-spin phases which can be understood in terms of Ising chains
which can be either coupled ferromagnetically or remain degenerate, thus
realizing a classical spin liquid. In addition, our results suggest the
existence of a flux phase with spontaneous inter-layer coherence.

program with the WFC3/UVIS camera onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The
HDUV extends and builds on the few previous UV imaging surveys in the two
GOODS/CANDELS-Deep fields to provide deep images over a total area of ~100
arcmin2 in the two filters F275W and F336W. Our release also includes all the
F275W imaging data taken by the CANDELS survey, which were aligned using a
novel approach and combined with the HDUV survey data. By reaching depths of
27.5-28.0 mag (5sigma, in 0.4"" apertures), these are the deepest
high-resolution UV data over such a large area taken to date. Such unique UV
imaging enables a wide range of science by the community. Among the main goals
of the HDUV survey are: (1) provide a complete sample of faint star-forming
galaxies at z~1-3, (2) constrain the ionizing photon escape fraction from
galaxies at z~2-3, and (3) track the build-up of bulges and the disappearance
of clumpy disk galaxies through reliable internal stellar population properties
at sub-kpc resolution out to z~3. The addition of the HDUV data further
enhances the legacy value of the two GOODS/CANDELS-Deep fields, which now
include deep 11-band HST imaging as well as very deep ancillary data from X-ray
to radio, enabling unique multi-wavelength studies. Here, we provide an
overview of the survey design, describe the data reduction, and highlight a few
basic analyses on the images which are released to the community as high level
science products via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST).

physics of 7-branes in Type IIB compactifications to various dimensions via
duality with M-theory. The geometric concepts underlying this dictionary
include the behaviour of elliptic fibrations in codimension one, two, three and

multiplicities exhibit an extremely rapid growth with the number $N$ of final
state particles. This either indicates an end of perturbative behaviour, or
possibly even a breakdown of the theory itself. It has recently been proposed
that in the Standard Model this could even lead to a solution of the hierarchy
problem in the form of a ""Higgsplosion"". To shed light on this question we
consider the quantum mechanical analogue of the scattering amplitude for $N$
particle production in $\phi^4$ scalar quantum field theory, which corresponds
to transitions $\langle N \lvert \hat{x} \rvert 0 \rangle$ in the anharmonic
oscillator with quartic coupling $\lambda$. We use recursion relations to
calculate the $\langle N \lvert \hat{x} \rvert 0 \rangle$ amplitudes to high
order in perturbation theory. Using this we provide evidence that the amplitude
can be written as $\langle N \lvert \hat{x} \rvert 0 \rangle \sim
\exp(F(\lambda N)/\lambda)$ in the limit of large $N$ and $\lambda N$ fixed. We
go beyond the leading order and provide a systematic expansion in powers of
$1/N$. We then resum the perturbative results and investigate the behaviour of
the amplitude in the region where tree-level perturbation theory violates
unitarity constraints. The resummed amplitudes are in line with unitarity as
well as stronger constraints derived by Bachas. We generalize our result to
arbitrary states and powers of local operators $\langle N \lvert \hat{x}^q
\rvert M \rangle$ and confirm that, to exponential accuracy, amplitudes in the
large $N$ limit are independent of the explicit form of the local operator,
i.e. in our case $q$.

morphological study of its warm dust. The partially resolved emission on scales
between $5$ and $50\,$mas ($1.6-16\,$pc) is decomposed into a resolved and an
unresolved source. Approximately $65\%$ of the correlated flux between $8$ and

dusty disk and a dusty wind with a half opening angle of $30^\circ$ can

that the emission-line ratios observed in galaxies with MgII in emission are
consistent with nebular emission from HII regions. From a simultaneous analysis
of MUSE spectra and ancillary HST information via spectral energy distribution
(SED) fitting, we find that galaxies with MgII in emission have lower stellar
masses, smaller sizes, bluer spectral slopes and lower optical depth than those
with absorption. This leads us to suggest that MgII emission is a potential
tracer of physical conditions not merely related to those of the ionized gas.
We show that these differences in MgII emission/absorption can be explained in
terms of a higher dust and neutral gas content in the interstellar medium (ISM)
of galaxies showing MgII in absorption, confirming the extreme sensitivity of
MgII to the presence of the neutral ISM. We conclude with an analogy between
the MgII doublet and the Ly-alpha line, due to their resonant nature. Further
investigations with current and future facilities, including JWST, are
promising as the detection of MgII emission and its potential connection with
Ly-alpha could provide new insights on the ISM content in the early Universe.

alone, due to a systematic discrepancy between the predicted and observed flux.
Rather, we find a significant preference (TS $=40$) for describing 47 Tuc's

spectra for a large number of giant stars, allowing a determination of the
abundances of the key chemical elements C and N at their surface. The surface
abundances of these chemical species are well-known to change in stars during
their evolution on the red giant branch after the first dredge-up episod, as a
result of extra-mixing phenomena. We investigate the effects of thermohaline
mixing on C and N abundances using the first comparison between the GES [C/N]
determinations with simulations of the observed fields using a model of stellar
population synthesis. We explore the effects of thermohaline mixing on the
chemical properties of giants through stellar evolutionary models computed with
the stellar evolution code STAREVOL. We include these stellar evolution models
in the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy model to simulate the [C/N] distributions determined
from the UVES spectra of the GES and compare them with the observations.
Theoretical predictions including the effect of thermohaline mixing are in good
agreement with the observations. However, the field stars in the GES with C and
N-abundance measurements have a metallicity close to solar, where the
efficiency of thermohaline mixing is not very large. The C and N abundances
derived by the GES in open and globular clusters clearly show the impact of
thermohaline mixing at low-metallicity, allowing to explain the [C/N] ratio

carbon isotopic ratio in clump field stars and open clusters, we also confirm
that thermohaline mixing should be taken into account to explain the behavior
of 12C/13C ratio as a function of stellar age. Overall the current model

the accuracy of simulation predictions. Fixed fields offer an alternative
initialization strategy; they have the same power spectrum as standard Gaussian
fields but without intrinsic amplitude scatter at linear order. Paired fixed
fields consists of two fixed fields with opposite phases that cancel phase
correlations which otherwise induce second-order scatter in the non-linear

different quantities at different redshifts through a large set of 600 N-body
and 506 state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamic simulations covering a wide range
of scales, mass and spatial resolutions. We find that paired fixed simulations
do not introduce a bias on any of the examined quantities. We quantify the
statistical improvement brought by these simulations, over standard ones, on
different power spectra such as matter, halos, CDM, gas, stars, black-holes and
magnetic fields, finding that they can reduce their variance by factors as
large as $10^6$. We quantify the improvement achieved by fixing and by pairing,
showing that sample variance in some quantities can be highly suppressed by
pairing after fixing. Paired fixed simulations do not change the scatter in
quantities such as the probability distribution function of matter density, or
the halo, void or stellar mass functions. We argue that procedures aiming at
reducing the sample variance of those quantities are unlikely to work. Our
results show that paired fixed simulations do not affect either mean relations

1-pt statistics is highly complementary to that in clustering.

applications has been an analysis of how quickly solutions to the penalized
program approach true optima to the original linear program. More than 20 years

gap in the literature regarding entropic penalization by giving a new proof of
the exponential convergence, valid for any linear program. Our proof is

extremely simple. We provide matching lower bounds and show that the entropic

discussion and implementation of open-endedness in evolutionary systems.
Drawing upon earlier work by Banzhaf et al., three different kinds of
open-endedness are identified: exploratory, expansive, and transformational.
These are characterised in terms of their relationship to the search space of
phenotypic behaviours. A formalism is introduced to describe three key
processes required for an evolutionary process: the generation of a phenotype
from a genetic description, the evaluation of that phenotype, and the
reproduction with variation of individuals according to their evaluation. The
distinction is made between intrinsic and extrinsic implementations of these
processes. A discussion then investigates how various interactions between
these processes, and their modes of implementation, can lead to open-endedness.
However, an important contribution of the paper is the demonstration that these
considerations relate to exploratory open-endedness only. Conditions for the
implementation of the more interesting kinds of open-endedness - expansive and
transformational - are also discussed, emphasizing factors such as multiple
domains of behaviour, transdomain bridges, and non-additive compositional
systems. These factors relate not to the generic evolutionary properties of
individuals and populations, but rather to the nature of the building blocks
out of which individual organisms are constructed, and the laws and properties
of the environment in which they exist. The paper ends with suggestions of how
the framework can be used to categorise and compare the open-ended evolutionary
potential of different systems, how it might guide the design of systems with
greater capacity for open-ended evolution, and how it might be further
improved.

estimation and inference in high-dimensional models. High-dimensional models
are characterized by having a number of unknown parameters that is not
vanishingly small relative to the sample size. We first present results in a
framework where estimators of parameters of interest may be represented
directly as approximate means. Within this context, we review fundamental
results including high-dimensional central limit theorems, bootstrap
approximation of high-dimensional limit distributions, and moderate deviation
theory. We also review key concepts underlying inference when many parameters
are of interest such as multiple testing with family-wise error rate or false
discovery rate control. We then turn to a general high-dimensional minimum
distance framework with a special focus on generalized method of moments
problems where we present results for estimation and inference about model
parameters. The presented results cover a wide array of econometric
applications, and we discuss several leading special cases including
high-dimensional linear regression and linear instrumental variables models to
illustrate the general results.

single-mask triple-GEM detectors, using foils manufactured by Tech-Etch, which
follow the design used by the STAR Forward GEM Tracker (FGT). The stack is
formed by gluing the foils to the frames and then gluing the frames together.
The stack also includes a Tech-Etch produced high voltage foil and a 2D

identically to the STAR FGT, the other three will investigate ways in which to
further decrease the material budget and increase the efficiency of the

have many extreme outliers, especially for PSPNet network in comparison to

kurtosis) allow us to distinguish these two networks and open the question
about relations between architecture of deep learning networks and statistical

demonstrated the different sensitivity of these networks to: (1) the local

particles with low aspect ratios were used to achieve a relatively high maximum
packing fraction of 0.86. Such a high maximum packing fraction allowed the
preparation of suspensions with a wide range of solid volume fractions in the
range of 0.62 to 0.82. The wall slip velocities of the suspensions in steady
torsional and capillary flows were characterized and determined to be fully
consistent with the mechanism of apparent slip layer formation at the wall.
Upon wall slip corrections it was found that at shear stresses which are
significantly above the yield stress the relative shear viscosity of the
suspensions obeys well the Krieger-Dougherty relationship that links the
relative shear viscosity behavior of dense suspensions solely to the ratio of
the volume fraction over the maximum packing fraction of solids. However, at
lower shear stresses that are in the vicinity of the yield stresses the
relative shear viscosity becomes functions of both the ratio of the volume
fraction over the maximum packing fraction and the shear stress. It is clearly
demonstrated that without wall slip analysis the accurate characterization of
the relative shear viscosity of dense suspensions is not possible.

flavor quark-antiquark pairs may be modified in the medium of a heavy-ion
collision. Purpose: This work tests this proposition through next-to-leading
order (NLO) calculations of the azimuthal distribution, $d\sigma/d\phi$,
including transverse momentum broadening, employing $<k_T^2>$ and fragmentation
in exclusive $Q \bar Q$ pair production. While these studies were done for
$p+p$, $p + \bar p$ and $p+$Pb collisions, understanding azimuthal angle
correlations between heavy quarks in these smaller, colder systems is important
for their interpretation in heavy-ion collisions. Methods: First, single
inclusive $p_T$ distributions calculated with the exclusive HVQMNR code are
compared to those calculated in the fixed-order next-to-leading logarithm
approach. Next the azimuthal distributions are calculated and sensitivities to
$<k_T^2>$, $p_T$ cut, and rapidity are studied at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. Finally,
calculations are compared to $Q \bar Q$ data in elementary $p+p$ and $p + \bar
p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV and 1.96 TeV as well as to the nuclear
modification factor $R_{p {\rm Pb}}(p_T)$ in $p+$Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV measured by ALICE. Results: The low $p_T$ ($p_T <
10$ GeV) azimuthal distributions are very sensitive to the $k_T$ broadening and
rather insensitive to the fragmentation function. The NLO contributions can
result in an enhancement at $\phi \sim 0$ absent any other effects. Agreement
with the data was found to be good. Conclusions: The NLO calculations, assuming
collinear factorization and introducing $k_T$ broadening, result in significant
modifications of the azimuthal distribution at low $p_T$ which must be taken
into account in calculations of these distributions in heavy-ion collisions.

applications run may not be trusted. Some concerns are then raised since it is
not trivial to provide the needed protection for these sensitive data. We
present a solution that considers the security components of FIWARE and the
Intel SGX capabilities. FIWARE is a platform created to support the development
of Smart Applications, including IoT systems, and SGX is the Intel solution for
Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). We propose a new component for key
management that, together with other FIWARE components, can be used to provide
privacy, confidentiality, and integrity guarantees for IoT data. A case study
illustrates how this proposed solution can be employed in a realistic scenario,
which allows the dissemination of sensitive data through public clouds without
risking privacy issues. The results of the experiments provide evidence that
our approach does not harm scalability or availability of the system. In
addition, it presents acceptable memory costs when considering the benefit of
the privacy guarantees achieved.

Sum-product networks (SPNs), on the other hand, are an excellent architecture

arbitrary marginalization and conditioning tasks. Nevertheless, SPNs have not
been fully explored as serious deep learning models, likely due to their

make a drastic simplification and use random SPN structures which are trained
in a ""classical deep learning manner"", i.e. employing automatic

order to avoid the additional complexity of wall-modeling, we perform LES of
turbulent channel flows in which the no-slip condition at the wall is replaced
by a Neumann condition supplying the exact mean wall-stress. The statistics
investigated are the mean velocity profile, turbulence intensities, and kinetic
energy spectra. The errors follow $(\Delta/L)^{\alpha}Re_\tau^{\gamma}$, where
$\Delta$ is the characteristic grid resolution, $Re_\tau$ is the friction
Reynolds number, and $L$ is the meaningful length-scale to normalize $\Delta$
in order to collapse the errors across the wall-normal distance. We show that
$\Delta$ can be expressed as the $L_2$-norm of the grid vector and that $L$ is
well represented by the ratio of the friction velocity and mean shear. The
exponent $\alpha$ is estimated from theoretical arguments for each statistical
quantity of interest and shown to roughly match the values computed by
numerical simulations. For the mean profile and kinetic energy spectra,
$\alpha\approx1$, whereas the turbulence intensities converge at a slower rate
$\alpha<1$. The exponent $\gamma$ is approximately $0$, i.e. the LES solution
is independent of the Reynolds number. The expected behavior of the turbulence
intensities at high Reynolds numbers is also derived and shown to agree with
the classic log-layer profiles for grid resolutions lying within the inertial
range. Further examination of the LES turbulence intensities and spectra
reveals that both quantities resemble their filtered counterparts from direct
numerical simulation (DNS) data, but that the mechanism responsible for this
similarity is related to the balance between the input power and dissipation
rather than to filtering.

case for score functions related to the solution of a partial differential

by the parsimonious use of a hierarchy of score function approximations in the
CE optimization process. The score function approximation is obtained by
selecting the surrogate of lowest dimensionality, whose accuracy guarantees to
pass the current CE optimization stage. The selection relies on certified upper
bounds on the error norm. An asymptotic analysis provides some theoretical

transverse localization arises from a combination of reciprocity, local

feed-forward neural networks with ReLU activation functions are affine linear
on. It is based on an inductive analysis that keeps track of the number of such
regions per dimensionality of their images within the layers. More precisely,
the information about the number regions per dimensionality is pushed through
the layers starting with one region of the input dimension of the neural
network and using a recursion based on an analysis of how many regions per
output dimensionality a subsequent layer with a certain width can induce on an
input region with a given dimensionality. The final bound on the number of
regions depends on the number and widths of the layers of the neural network
and on some additional parameters that were used for the recursion. It is
stated in terms of the $L1$-norm of the last column of a product of matrices
and provides a unifying treatment of several previously known bounds: Depending
on the choice of the recursion parameters that determine these matrices, it is
possible to obtain the bounds from Mont\'{u}far (2014), (2017) and Serra et.
al. (2017) as special cases. For the latter, which is the strongest of these
bounds, the formulation in terms of matrices provides new insight. In
particular, by using explicit formulas for a Jordan-like decomposition of the
involved matrices, we achieve new tighter results for the asymptotic setting,
where the number of layers of the same fixed width tends to infinity.

succession, extinction, mimicry, and gene duplication to search neural network
structure from scratch with poorly initialized simple network and few
constraints forced during the evolution, as we assume no prior knowledge about
the task domain. Specifically, we first use primary succession to rapidly
evolve a population of poorly initialized neural network structures into a more
diverse population, followed by a secondary succession stage for fine-grained
searching based on the networks from the primary succession. Extinction is
applied in both stages to reduce computational cost. Mimicry is employed during
the entire evolution process to help the inferior networks imitate the behavior
of a superior network and gene duplication is utilized to duplicate the learned
blocks of novel structures, both of which help to find better network
structures. Experimental results show that our proposed approach can achieve
similar or better performance compared to the existing genetic approaches with
dramatically reduced computation cost. For example, the network discovered by
our approach on CIFAR-100 dataset achieves 78.1% test accuracy under 120 GPU

study of such dynamics, with a clear description of the behaviour of an
incoming flux of particles. We will be able, then, to calibrate the free
parameters of the model to Rosetta observations.
  Methods. Basic tools of dynamical analysis are used. They lead to a
definition of the relevant parameters for the system and a classification of
the possible types of trajectories. Using the so-obtained formalism, the
structures formed by a flux of particles coming from infinity can be studied.
  Results. All the trajectories are parametrised by two characteristic radii,
rE and rC, derived from first integrals. There are three different types of
motion possible divided by a separatrix corresponding to rE = rC. An analytical
expression of the trajectories, defined by an integral, is developed. Using
this formalism, the application to a flux of particles coming from infinity
(modelling the incident solar wind) gives one free parameter only, the radius
rE, which scales the problem. A circular cavity of radius 0.28 rE is created,
as well as an overdensity curve (analogous to a caustic in optics). At each
observation time, rE can be calibrated to Rosetta plasma measurements, giving a
qualitative understanding of the solar particle dynamics (incoming direction,
cavity and density map). We also deduce that, in order to properly capture the
essence of the dynamics, numerical simulations of the solar wind around a comet
must use simulation boxes much larger than rE and grids much finer than rE.

events by means of simulating a large number of copies of the system,
supplemented with a selection rule that favours the rare trajectories of
interest. The cloning algorithm allows the estimation of a large deviation
function (LDF) of additive observables in Markov processes. However, such
algorithms are plagued by finite simulation time $t$ and finite population size
$N_c$ effects that can render their use delicate. First, using a non-constant
population approach, we analyze the small-$N_c$ effects in the initial
transient regime. These effects play an important role in the numerical
determination of LDF. We show how to overcome these effects by introducing a
time delay in the evolution of populations, additional to the discarding of the
initial regime of the population growth where these discreteness effects are
strong. Then, the study of the finite-$t$ and finite-$N_c$ scalings in the LDF
evaluation is done using two different versions of the algorithm, in discrete
and continuous-time. We show that these scalings behave as $1/N_c$ and $1/t$ in
the large-$N_c$ and large-$t$ asymptotics respectively. Moreover, we show that
one can make use of this convergence speed in order to extract the asymptotic
behavior in the infinite-$t$ and infinite-$N_c$ limits resulting in a better
LDF estimation. These scalings are later generalized and evidence of a
breakdown for large-size systems is presented.

""cosmic noon"". We have used ALMA to obtain resolved imaging and kinematics of
atomic and molecular emission lines, and rest-frame $340$ to $1160$GHz
continuum emission, for the known luminous component galaxies in H-ATLAS
$J084933.4+021443$: W, T, M, C. All four component galaxies are spatially
($\sim 0 .\!\!^{''} 3$ or $2.5$kpc) resolved in CO J:7-6, [C$_\mathrm{I}$] 2-1,
H$_2$O and the millimetre (mm) to sub-mm continuum. Rotation-dominated gas
kinematics is confirmed in W and T. The significant extension to component T,
in gas and continuum, along its kinematic minor axis, is attributable to its
lensing magnification. Spatially resolved sub-mm spectral energy distributions
reveal that component W is well fit with greybody emission from dust at a
single temperature over the full extent of the galaxy, despite it containing a
powerful AGN, while component T requires an additional component of hotter
nuclear dust and additional sources of emission in the mm. We confirm that
[C$_\mathrm{I}$] 2-1 can be used as a rough tracer of warm/dense molecular gas
in extreme systems, though the [C$_\mathrm{I}$] 2-1/CO luminosity ratio
increases sub-linearly. We obtain an exquisite and unprecedented resolved
($2.5$-kpc-scale) ""warm/dense molecular gas"" Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK)
relationship for components W and T. Gas exhaustion times for all apertures in
W (T) are $1-4$Gyr ($0.5-2$Gyr). Both W and T follow a resolved ""warm/dense
gas"" SK relationship with power law $n\sim1.7$, significantly steeper than the
$n\sim1$ found previously via ""cold"" molecular gas in nearby ""normal""
star-forming galaxies.

led to the development of automated methods for gland segmentation that aim to
overcome the challenges of manual segmentation. However, this task is
non-trivial due to the large variability in glandular appearance and the
difficulty in differentiating between certain glandular and non-glandular
histological structures. Furthermore, a measure of uncertainty is essential for
diagnostic decision making. To address these challenges, we propose a fully
convolutional neural network that counters the loss of information caused by
max-pooling by re-introducing the original image at multiple points within the
network. We also use atrous spatial pyramid pooling with varying dilation rates
for preserving the resolution and multi-level aggregation. To incorporate
uncertainty, we introduce random transformations during test time for an
enhanced segmentation result that simultaneously generates an uncertainty map,
highlighting areas of ambiguity. We show that this map can be used to define a
metric for disregarding predictions with high uncertainty. The proposed network
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GlaS challenge dataset and on a
second independent colorectal adenocarcinoma dataset. In addition, we perform
gland instance segmentation on whole-slide images from two further datasets to
highlight the generalisability of our method. As an extension, we introduce

closed Reeb orbits, then its systolic ration is defined to be the quotient of
(n+1)th power of the shortest period of Reeb orbits by the contact volume. We
prove that every co-orientable contact structure on any closed contact manifold
admits a contact form with arbitrarily large systolic ratio. This statement
generalizes the recent result of Abbondandolo et al. in dimension three to
higher dimensions. We extend the plug construction of Abbondandolo et. al. to
any dimension, by means of generalizing the hamiltonian disc maps studied by
the authors to the symplectic ball of any dimension. The plug is a mapping
torus and it is equipped with a special contact form so that one can use it to
modify a given contact form if the Reeb flow leads to a circle bundle on a
""large"" portion of the given contact manifold. Inserting the plug sucks up the
contact volume while the minimal period remains the same. Following the ideas
of Abbondandolo et al. and using Giroux's theory of Liouville open books, we
show that any co-orientable contact structure is defined by a contact form,

Our method can be incor- porated with a variety of sampling-based planners to

construct linear predictions for all points in the dataset. The performance of
the predictions is evaluated by the total square loss on all responses (the

the least squares solution obtained for the volume sampled subproblem is an
unbiased estimator of optimal solution based on all n responses. This
unbiasedness is a desirable property that is not shared by other common subset

computer vision. In the last decades, researchers developed a large number of
segmentation algorithms for various applications. Amongst these algorithms, the
Normalized cut (Ncut) segmentation method is widely applied due to its good
performance. The Ncut segmentation model is an optimization problem whose
energy is defined on a specifically designed graph. Thus, the segmentation
results of the existing Ncut method are largely dependent on a pre-constructed
similarity measure on the graph since this measure is usually given empirically
by users. This flaw will lead to some undesirable segmentation results. In this
paper, we propose a Ncut-based segmentation algorithm by integrating an
adaptive similarity measure and spatial regularization. The proposed model
combines the Parzen-Rosenblatt window method, non-local weights entropy, Ncut
energy, and regularizer of phase field in a variational framework. Our method
can adaptively update the similarity measure function by estimating some
parameters. This adaptive procedure enables the proposed algorithm finding a
better similarity measure for classification than the Ncut method. We provide
some mathematical interpretation of the proposed adaptive similarity from
multi-viewpoints such as statistics and convex optimization. In addition, the
regularizer of phase field can guarantee that the proposed algorithm has a
robust performance in the presence of noise, and it can also rectify the
similarity measure with a spatial priori. The well-posed theory such as the
existence of the minimizer for the proposed model is given in the paper.
Compared with some existing segmentation methods such as the traditional
Ncut-based model and the classical Chan-Vese model, the numerical experiments
show that our method can provide promising segmentation results.

between these values and the nuclear stellar velocity dispersion. There are
also relations between the metallicity/age gradients and the velocity
dispersion. Contributions of 1-4 Gyr old stellar populations were found in
IC5328 and NGC6758 as well as 4-8 Gyr old ones in NGC5812. Extended gas is

with many Markov chain samplers, their Gibbs sampler lacks a theoretically
sound method of output analysis --- a method for estimating the variance of a
given ergodic average and estimating how closely the chain is sampling from the
stationary distribution, that is, the burn-in.
  In this paper, we address this shortcoming by identifying regenerative
structure in the sampler of Park and Casella, thus providing a theoretically
sound method of assessing its performance. The regenerative structure provides
both a strongly consistent variance estimator, and an estimator of (an upper
bound on) the total variation distance from the target posterior density. The
result is a simple and theoretically sound way to assess the stationarity of
the Park and Casella and, more generally, other MCMC samplers, for which
regenerative simulation is possible.

calculated by our regenerative method by comparing it with the standard errors
calculated by an AR(1) heuristic approximation. Thus, we show that for the
Bayesian Lasso model, the regenerative method is a viable and theoretically
justified alternative to the existing ad-hoc MCMC convergence diagnostics.

computing resources may result in a small number of independent estimates
spread over many orders of magnitude. Such small-sample, high ""log-variance""
data are not readily amenable to analysis using the standard uncertainty (i.e.,
""standard error of the mean"") because unphysical negative limits of confidence
intervals result. Bootstrapping, a natural alternative guaranteed to yield a
confidence interval within the minimum and maximum values, also exhibits a
striking systematic bias of the lower confidence limit in log space. As we
show, bootstrapping artifactually assigns high probability to improbably low
mean values. A second alternative, the Bayesian bootstrap strategy, does not
suffer from the same deficit and is more logically consistent with the type of
confidence interval desired. The Bayesian bootstrap provides uncertainty
intervals that are more reliable than those from the standard bootstrap method,
but must be used with caution nevertheless. Neither standard nor Bayesian
bootstrapping can overcome the intrinsic challenge of under-estimating the mean
from small-size, high log-variance samples. Our conclusions are based on
extensive analysis of model distributions and re-analysis of multiple
independent atomistic simulations. Although we only analyze rate constants,
similar considerations will apply to related calculations, potentially
including highly non-linear averages like the Jarzynski relation.

measure under the original stochastic process to reversed paths, and those that
construct a new, adjoint measure by similarity transform, which locally
reverses probability currents. Results that use the original measure have a
natural interpretation in terms of time-reversal of the dynamics. Here we
develop a general interpretation of fluctuation theorems based on the adjoint
process by considering the duality of the Kolmogorov-forward and backward
equations, acting on distributions versus observables. The backward propagation
of the dependency of observables is related to problems of statistical
inference, so we characterize the adjoint construction as a duality between
dynamics and inference.
  The adjoint process corresponds to the Kolmogorov backward equation in a
generating functional that erases memory from the dynamics of its underlying
distribution. We show how erasure affects general correlation functions by
showing that duality under the adjoint fluctuation theorems exchanges the roles
of advanced and retarded Green's functions. We derive results for the class of
discrete-state stochastic processes corresponding to Chemical Reaction Networks
(CRNs), and show that dualization acts on the \emph{finite} representation of
the generating event-set, in a manner similar to the usual similarity transform
acting on the (potentially infinite) set of state transitions. We construct
generating functionals within the Doi-Peliti (DP) functional integral
framework, within which duality transformation takes a remarkably simple form
as a change of integration variable. Our Green's function analysis recovers the
Extended Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem of Seifert and Speck for
non-equilibrium steady states, shows that the causal structure responsible for
it applies also to dualization about non-steady states.

laser point cloud can be gathered through Vehicle-borne laser scanning system,
which integrates a variety types of sensors which include GNSS/INS,laser

which greatly improves the detection efficiency. The method proposed consists
of four parts, which are data preparation, image preprocessing, binarization
and crack enhancement. This method combines the advantages of digital image and
laser point cloud to solve the problem. High density laser point cloud are
first interpolated into georeferenced feature (GRF) image, then median filter,
morphology, local adaptive threshold and multi scale iterative tensor voting
method are used to detect pavement cracks from GRF image. At last, Hausdorff
distance is used to evaluate detection precision. The SM value reached around

however, is challenging due to strict power, cost and hardware constraints at
higher bandwidths. To achieve a good SNR for communication, mmWave systems use
large antenna arrays. Beamforming with highly directional beams is one way to
use the antennas. As the channel changes over time, the beams that maximize the
SNR have to be estimated quickly to reduce the training overhead. Prior work
has exploited the observation that mmWave channels are sparse to perform
compressed sensing (CS) based beam alignment with few channel measurements.
Most of the existing CS-based algorithms, however, assume perfect
synchronization and fail in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO).
This paper presents Swift-Link, a fast beam alignment algorithm that is robust
against the offset. Swift-Link includes a novel randomized beam training
sequence that minimizes the beam alignment errors due to CFO and a
low-complexity algorithm that corrects these errors. Even with strict hardware
constraints, our algorithm uses fewer channel measurements than comparable CS

authentication in resourceconstrained applications but vulnerable to machine
learning attacks. In order to resist such attack, many defenses have been
proposed in recent years. However, these defenses incur high hardware overhead,
degenerate reliability and are inefficient against advanced machine learning
attacks such as approximation attacks. In order to address these issues, we
propose a Random Set-based Obfuscation (RSO) for Strong PUFs to resist machine
learning attacks. The basic idea is that several stable responses are derived
from the PUF itself and pre-stored as the set for obfuscation in the testing
phase, and then a true random number generator is used to select any two keys
to obfuscate challenges and responses with XOR operations. When the number of
challenge-response pairs (CRPs) collected by the attacker exceeds the given
threshold, the set will be updated immediately. In this way, machine learning
attacks can be prevented with extremely low hardware overhead. Experimental
results show that for a 64x64 Arbiter PUF, when the size of set is 32 and even
if 1 million CRPs are collected by attackers, the prediction accuracies of
Logistic regression, support vector machines, artificial neural network,
convolutional neural network and covariance matrix adaptive evolutionary
strategy are about 50% which is equivalent to the random guessing.

In practical systems, availability of eavesdroppers Channel State Information

eavesdroppers, 2 imperfect CSI of the eavesdroppers. Since the proposed
optimization problems are nonconvex, we adopt the well known iterative
algorithm called Alternative Search Method. In this algorithm, the optimization
problems are converted to two subproblems, power allocation and subcarrier
allocation. We solve the power allocation problem by the Successive Convex

exploiting the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search algorithm. Moreover, in order to
study the optimality gap of the proposed solution method, we apply the

whether the null or alternative hypothesis is in effect. We first provide a
general lower bound on the type-II exponent for an arbitrary pair of

0.3 and > 1 keV from about 0.2 keV. A hard non-thermal spectral component with
a photon index < 0.5 related to the magnetospheric emission can be resolved
from the NuSTAR spectra above 10 keV. We find that the thermal emitting regions
did not cool down and gradually shrank by about (20-35)% four months after the
outburst. Hard X-ray pulsations were detected with NuSTAR immediately after the
outburst, at 5 sigma confidence level and with a background-subtracted pulsed
fraction of (40+-10)%. However, the signal became undetectable after a few
days. Using Fermi data, we found that the gamma-ray emission in 0.5-300 GeV was
suppressed along with the disappearance of the radio pulsations. This is likely
caused by a reconfiguration of the magnetic field. We also discovered that the
timing noise evolved dramatically, and the spin-down rate significantly
increased after the 2016 glitch. We proposed that post-outburst temporal and
spectral behaviors from radio to gamma-ray bands were caused by changes of the

solutions to time-dependent partial differential equations is very important.
Here, we investigate this topic in the context of hyperbolic conservation laws
and flux reconstruction schemes, focusing on the schemes in the discontinuous
Galerkin spectral element framework. For linear problems with constant
coefficients, it is well-known in the literature that the choice of the
numerical flux (e.g. central or upwind) and the selection of the polynomial
basis (e.g. Gau{\ss}-Legendre or Gau{\ss}-Lobatto-Legendre) affects both the
growth rate and the asymptotic value of the error. Here, we extend these
investigations of the long time error to variable coefficients using both
Gau{\ss}-Lobatto-Legendre and Gau{\ss}-Legendre nodes as well as several
numerical fluxes. We derive conditions guaranteeing that the errors are still
bounded in time. Furthermore, we analyse the error behaviour under these
conditions and demonstrate in several numerical tests similarities to the case
of constant coefficients. However, if these conditions are violated, the error
shows a completely different behaviour. Indeed, by applying central numerical
fluxes, the error increases without upper bound while upwind numerical fluxes
can still result in uniformly bounded numerical errors. An explanation for this
phenomenon is given, confirming our analytical investigations.

equations (PDEs) are fundamental to the modeling of many problems such as heat
transfer and flow in porous media. Many of such PDEs are stochastic due to the
presence of uncertainty in the conductivity field. Based on the relation
between stochastic diffusion processes and PDEs, Monte Carlo (MC) methods are
available to solve these PDEs. These methods are especially relevant for cases
where we are interested in the solution in a small subset of the domain. The
existing MC methods based on the stochastic formulation require restrictively
small time steps for high variance conductivity fields. Moreover, in many
applications the conductivity is piecewise constant and the existing methods
are not readily applicable in these cases. Here we provide an algorithm to
solve one-dimensional elliptic problems that bypasses these two limitations.
The methodology is demonstrated using problems governed by deterministic and
stochastic PDEs. It is shown that the method provides an efficient alternative
to compute the statistical moments of the solution to a stochastic PDE at any
point in the domain. A variance reduction scheme is proposed for applying the
method for efficient mean calculations.

enough to be applicable to other nonparametric problems. We provide a formal

technical tools used in its calculation, and provide proofs of related
asymptotic results. Next, we apply this approach to calculating the
intermediate efficiency of the new test with respect to the classical one-sided
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which is a recognized standard for this problem. It
turns out that for a very large class of convergent alternatives the new test
is more efficient than the classical one. We also report the results of an

that the new variant of intermediate efficiency reflects the exact behavior of

codes. In the present paper, we derive a matching lower bound by adapting the
proof techniques used originally for Reed-Muller (RM) codes by Wei. This
results in a characterization of the GHW hierarchy of binary PRM codes.

mitigate knee pain and improve functions for people with knee arthritis. The
procedure is complicated due to the different surgical tools used in the stages
of surgery. The recognition of surgical tools in real-time can be a solution to
simplify surgical procedures for the surgeon. Also, the presence and movement
of tools in surgery are crucial information for the recognition of the
operational phase and to identify the surgical workflow. Therefore, this
research proposes the development of a real-time system for the recognition of
surgical tools during surgery using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
Surgeons wearing smart glasses can see essential information about tools during
surgery that may reduce the complication of the procedures. To evaluate the
performance of the proposed method, we calculated and compared the Mean Average
Precision (MAP) with state-of-the-art methods which are fast R-CNN and
deformable part models (DPM). We achieved 87.6% mAP which is better in
comparison to the existing methods. With the additional improvements of our

one attack algorithm boils down to enabling a different norm or attack
algorithm to succeed. This is backed up by our formal analysis showing that
static security guarantees are opposed to learning. Concerning intellectual
property, we show formally that lazy learning does not necessarily leak all

be found. For example, we are able to secure GPC against empirical membership

conclude that attacks on classification should not be studied in isolation, but

vortex fields which produce certain electron resonances in velocity space. A
more detailed investigation of the underlying theory is presented in a
companion paper (U Czarnetzki, submitted to PSST (2018), arXiv:1806.00505).
  Here, the new concept is experimentally realized for the first time by the
INCA (INductively Coupled Array) discharge. The periodic vortex fields are
produced by an array of small planar coils. It is shown that the array can be
scaled up to arbitrary dimensions while keeping its electrical characteristics.
Stable operation at pressures around and below 1 Pa is demonstrated. The power
coupling efficiency is characterized and an increase in the efficiency is
observed with decreasing pressure. The spatial homogeneity of the discharge is
investigated and the behaviour of the plasma parameters with power and pressure
are presented. Linear scaling of the plasma density with power and pressure,
typical for conventional inductive discharges, is observed. Most notably, the
plasma potential and the corresponding mean ion energy show clear evidence for
the presence of super energetic electrons, attributed to stochastic heating. In
the stochastic heating mode, the electron distribution function becomes
approximately Maxwellian but with increasing pressure it turns to the
characteristic local distribution function known from classical inductive
discharges. Large area processing or thrusters are possible applications for
this new plasma source.

the rank-$r$ solution, which suggests that operating over the factors leads to
an implicit regularization. In this contribution, we provide a different

water-splitting due to their small band gaps and suitably aligned band edges.
Recently, epitaxially strained oxynitrides started to attract interest due to
the possibility to engineer the anion order and ferroelectric distortions.
However, contrary to oxides there have been no studies on the band-gap
evolution in oxynitrides with epitaxial strain. Here, we investigate, using
density functional theory calculations, the influence of epitaxial strain on
the band gap of two different oxynitrides and compare our results with oxides.
As opposed to cubic oxides, where both compressive and tensile strain narrow
the band-gap, we find that the anion order leads to non-degenerate N
\textit{2p} bands already at zero strain, which leads to opposite and anion
order-dependent evolutions of the band gap under compressive and tensile
strain. Further, we find that in oxynitrides polar distortions increase the
band gap by up to 1 eV for 4% strain whereas for oxides the increase is only
about 0.1 eV for the same amount of strain. The reason for this difference is
the larger ionic radius of nitrogen leading to larger ferroelectric distortions
and a stronger dependence of the band gap on the distortions amplitude. These
results imply that ferroelectric distortions are strongly detrimental to light
absorption and that their suppression, for example above a critical
temperature, should result in a marked decrease in band gap and enhanced
absorption of visible light.

accessed in SDN as well as security attributes associated with the switches and
Controllers in different domains. An important feature of our architecture is
its ability to specify path and flow based security policies, which are

demonstrate its use in scenarios involving both intra and inter-domain

investigate the impact of UAV altitude, hovering time, number of waypoints and
path length through formulating an energy-constrained optimization problem. Our
results show that increasing the hovering time decreases the localization error
considerably at the cost of a higher energy consumption. To keep the
localization error below 100m, shorter hovering is only possible when the path
altitude and radius are optimized. For a constant hovering time of 5 seconds,
tuning both parameters to their optimal values brings the localization error
from 150m down to 65m with a power saving around 25%

We also show that this item hierarchy can be useful in making category based
recommendations, which makes the recommendations more explainable and increases
the diversity of the recommendations without compromising much on the accuracy.
Item hierarchy can also be useful in the creation of an automatic item taxonomy

These COMs can then undergo hydrogen addition and abstraction reactions leading
to a higher or lower degree of saturation. Here, we have studied 14 hydrogen
transfer reactions for the molecules glyoxal, glycoaldehyde, ethylene glycol,
and methylformate and an additional three reactions where \ce{CH_nO} fragments
are involved. Over-the-barrier reactions are possible only if tunneling is
invoked in the description at low temperature. Therefore the rate constants for
the studied reactions are calculated using instanton theory that takes quantum
effects into account inherently. The reactions were characterized in the gas
phase, but this is expected to yield meaningful results for CO-rich ices due to
the minimal alteration of reaction landscapes by the CO molecules.
  We found that rate constants should not be extrapolated based on the height
of the barrier alone, since the shape of the barrier plays an increasingly
larger role at decreasing temperature. It is neither possible to predict rate
constants based only on considering the type of reaction, the specific
reactants and functional groups play a crucial role. Within a single molecule,
though, hydrogen abstraction from an aldehyde group seems to be always faster
than hydrogen addition to the same carbon atom. Reactions that involve
heavy-atom tunneling, e.g., breaking or forming a C--C or C--O bond, have rate
constants that are much lower than those where H transfer is involved.

problem in computer vision with many applications. Although it has been studied
extensively, however, no method currently exists that can robustly predict
visual differences like humans. Some previous approaches used hand-coded
models, but they fail to model the complexity of the human visual system.
Others used machine learning to train models on human-labeled datasets, but
creating large, high-quality datasets is difficult because people are unable to
assign consistent error labels to distorted images. In this paper, we present a
new learning-based method that is the first to predict perceptual image error
like human observers. Since it is much easier for people to compare two given
images and identify the one more similar to a reference than to assign quality
scores to each, we propose a new, large-scale dataset labeled with the
probability that humans will prefer one image over another. We then train a
deep-learning model using a novel, pairwise-learning framework to predict the
preference of one distorted image over the other. Our key observation is that
our trained network can then be used separately with only one distorted image
and a reference to predict its perceptual error, without ever being trained on
explicit human perceptual-error labels. The perceptual error estimated by our
new metric, PieAPP, is well-correlated with human opinion. Furthermore, it
significantly outperforms existing algorithms, beating the state-of-the-art by
almost 3x on our test set in terms of binary error rate, while also
generalizing to new kinds of distortions, unlike previous learning-based

parameter perturbations can be determined using the shadowing direction, the
uniformly-bounded-in-time solution of the sensitivity equations. Although its
existence is formally guaranteed for certain systems, methods to determine it
are hardly available. One practical approach is the Least-Squares Shadowing
(LSS) algorithm (Q Wang, SIAM J Numer Anal 52, 156, 2014), whereby the
shadowing direction is approximated by the solution of the sensitivity
equations with the least square average norm. Here, we present an alternative,
potentially simpler shadowing-based algorithm, termed periodic shadowing. The
key idea is to obtain a bounded solution of the sensitivity equations by
complementing it with periodic boundary conditions in time. We show that this
is not only justifiable when the reference trajectory is itself periodic, but
also possible and effective for chaotic trajectories. Our error analysis shows
that periodic shadowing has the same convergence rates as LSS when the time
span $T$ is increased: the sensitivity error first decays as $1/T$ and then,
asymptotically as $1/\sqrt{T}$. We demonstrate the approach on the Lorenz
equations, and also show that, as $T$ tends to infinity, periodic shadowing
sensitivities converge to the same value obtained from long unstable periodic
orbits (D Lasagna, SIAM J Appl Dyn Syst 17, 1, 2018) for which there is no
shadowing error. Finally, finite-difference approximations of the sensitivity
are also examined, and we show that subtle non-hyperbolicity features of the
Lorenz system introduce a small, yet systematic, bias.

possible existence of spurious finite-size instabilities of this new Gogny

used parameterizations (D1, D1S, D1N, D1M) of the Gogny force. This study is
based on a fully-antisymmetrized random phase approximation (RPA) calculation
of the nuclear matter response functions employing the continued fraction
technique. It turns out that this new Gogny interaction is affected by spurious
finite-size instabilities in the scalar isovector channel; hence, unphysical
results are expected in the calculation of properties of nuclei, like neutron
and proton densities, if this D1M* force is used. The conclusions from this
study are then, for the first time, tested against mean-field calculations in a
coordinate representation for several nuclei. Unphysical results for several
nuclei are also obtained with the D1N parameterization of the Gogny force.
These observations strongly advocate for the use of the linear response
formalism to detect and avoid finite-size instabilities during the fit of the
parameters of Gogny interactions as it is already done for some Skyrme forces.

exchange to acquire this information. Based on the D2D users' knowledge of

approach outperforms centralized one. We start by proposing a centralized
scheduling that requires the knowledge of D2D links' CSI at the base station
level. This CSI reporting suffers from the limited number of resources
available for feedback transmission. Therefore, we benefit from the users'
knowledge of their local CSI to develop a distributed algorithm for D2D
resource allocation. In distributed approach, collisions may occur between the
different CSI reporting; thus a collision reduction algorithm is proposed. We
give a description on how both centralized and distributed algorithms can be

backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data has not been adequately explored. The basic
aim of most EBSD analysis is to segment the spatial domain to reveal and
quantify the microstructure, and links this to knowledge of the crystallography
(eg crystal phase, orientation) within each segmented region. Two analysis
strategies have been explored; principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means
clustering. The intensity at individual (binned) pixels on the detector were
used as the variables defining the multidimensional space in which each pattern
in the map generates a single discrete point. PCA analysis alone did not work
well but rotating factors to the VARIMAX solution did. K-means clustering also
successfully segmented the data but was computational more expensive. The
characteristic patterns produced by either VARIMAX or k-means clustering
enhance weak patterns, remove pattern overlap, and allow subtle effects from
polarity to be distinguished. Combining multivariate statistical analysis (MSA)
approaches with template matching to simulation libraries can significantly
reduce computational demand as the number of patterns to be matched is
drastically reduced. Both template matching and MSA approaches may augment
existing analysis methods but will not replace them in the majority of
applications.

Newton-Okounkov bodies. Toric degenerations can be seen as a combinatorial
shadow of the original objects. The goal is therefore to understand why the
different theories are so closely related, by understanding the toric
degenerations they yield first. We choose Grassmannians, flag varieties and
Schubert varieties as starting point as here many different constructions are
applicable. One of our main results gives a sufficient condition for when toric
degenerations obtained using full-rank valuations, independent of how these are
constructed, can be realized using tropical geometry.

design G\""odel machine. Such a machine could solve a variety of design problems
by generating novel concepts. In addition, it could change the way these
concepts are generated by modifying itself. The design G\""odel machine is able
to improve its initial design program, once it has proven that a modification
would increase its return on the utility function. Finally, we sketch out a
specific version of the design G\""odel machine which specifically addresses the

development of a more formal version of the design G\""odel machine and a proof

key molecules in these studies. In earlier studies, strongly reducing gas
mixtures containing methane and ammonia were mainly used to simulate possible
reactions in primitive Earth atmosphere, and amino acids and other organic
compounds were detected. Since the primitive Earth atmosphere was estimated to
be less reducing, contribution of extraterrestrial organics to the origin of

experimentally and theoretically studied intensively, including laboratory
experiments simulating interstellar molecular reactions. Endogenous and
exogenous organics should have been supplied to the primitive ocean. Now
submarine hydrothermal systems are considered one of the plausible sites of
generation of life. Experiments simulating submarine hydrothermal systems where
methane played an important role are now intensively being conducted. We have
recognized the importance of such studies on possible reactions in other solar
system bodies to understand the origins of life. Titan and other icy bodies,

by asking the obverse question: What sort of spacetime (assuming the Einstein

that type III is incompatible with either planar or spherical symmetry, so one
should be looking at spacetimes of low symmetry (or no symmetry). Finding such
a type III spacetime is a matter of somehow finding an appropriate ansatz for
the metric, calculating the Einstein tensor, and analyzing the pattern of
(Lorentz invariant) eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Herein we report some
(partial) success along these lines - we explicitly exhibit several (somewhat
unnatural) spacetime geometries with a type III Einstein tensor. We then build
an explicit but somewhat odd Lagrangian model leading (in Minkowski space) to
type III stress-energy. While we still have no fully acceptable general
physical model for type III stress-energy, we can at least say something about

results demonstrate a major increase in the achievable precision of the

  We analyse the first SONG time series for the star 46 LMi, which has a
precise parallax and an angular diameter measured from interferometry, and
therefore a good determination of the stellar radius. We use asteroseismic
scaling relations to obtain an accurate mass, and modelling to determine the
age.
  A 55-day time series of high-resolution, high S/N spectra were obtained with
the first SONG telescope. We derive the asteroseismic parameters by analysing
the power spectrum. To give a best guess on the large separation of modes in
the power spectrum, we have applied a new method which uses the scaling of
Kepler red-giant stars to 46 LMi.
  Several methods have been applied: classical estimates, seismic methods using
the observed time series, and model calculations to derive the fundamental

consistent within the uncertainties. We find the following values for the mass
M (scaling), radius R (classical), age (modelling), and surface gravity

depending on local Young's modulus and Schmid factor. A Monte Carlo simulation

investigate the entanglement generation and its evolution on such systems -
particularly an irradiated ferromagnetic XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ model in a
honeycomb lattice as the system parameters are optically tuned. In the high
frequency limit, we compute the lowest quasi-energy state entanglement in terms
of the concurrence between nearest neighbor (NN) and NNN pair of spins and
witness the entanglement transitions occurring there. For the easy axis
scenario, the unirradiated system forms a product state but entanglement grows
between the NNN spin pairs beyond some cut-off DM strength. Contrarily in easy
planar case, NN and NNN spins remain already entangled in the unirradiated
limit. It then goes through an entanglement transition which causes decrease
(increase) of the NN (NNN) concurrences down to zero (up to some higher value)
at some critical finite DM interaction strength. For a high frequency of
irradiation and a suitably chosen anisotropy parameter, we can vary the field
strength to witness sudden death and revival of entanglement in the Floquet
system. Both exact diagonalization and modified Lanczos techniques are used to
obtain the results upto 24 site lattice. We also calculate the thermal
entanglement and obtain estimates for the threshold temperatures below which
non-zero concurrence can be expected in the system.

basic actions. However, while HTN planners 'lookahead' over the consequences of
choosing one refinement over another, BDI agents interleave refinement with
acting. There has been renewed interest in making HTN planners behave more like
BDI agent systems, e.g. to have a unified representation for acting and
planning. However, past work on the subject has remained informal or
implementation-focused. This paper is a formal account of 'HTN acting', which
supports interleaved deliberation, acting, and failure recovery. We use the

diagnosis tasks of retinopathy. Segmenting vessels accurately is a fundamental
step in analysing retinal images. However, it is usually difficult due to
various imaging conditions, low image contrast and the appearance of
pathologies such as micro-aneurysms. In this paper, we propose a novel method
with deep neural networks to solve this problem. We utilize U-net with residual
connection to detect vessels. To achieve better accuracy, we introduce an
edge-aware mechanism, in which we convert the original task into a multi-class
task by adding additional labels on boundary areas. In this way, the network
will pay more attention to the boundary areas of vessels and achieve a better
performance, especially in tiny vessels detecting. Besides, side output layers
are applied in order to give deep supervision and therefore help convergence.
We train and evaluate our model on three databases: DRIVE, STARE, and CHASEDB1.
Experimental results show that our method has a comparable performance with AUC
of 97.99% on DRIVE and an efficient running time compared to the
state-of-the-art methods.

challenging problem, and this becomes even more challenging when the sample
size is small. Over the last few decades, several graph-based two-sample tests
have been proposed in the literature, which can be used for data of arbitrary
dimensions. Most of these test statistics are computed using pairwise Euclidean
distances among the observations. But, due to concentration of pairwise
Euclidean distances, these tests have poor performance in many high-dimensional
problems. Some of them can have powers even below the nominal level when the
scale-difference between two distributions dominates the location-difference.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new class of dissimilarity
indices and use it to modify some popular graph-based tests. These modified
tests use the distance concentration phenomenon to their advantage, and as a
result, they outperform the corresponding tests based on the Euclidean distance
in a wide variety of examples. We establish the high-dimensional consistency of
these modified tests under fairly general conditions. Analyzing several
simulated as well as real data sets, we demonstrate their usefulness in high
dimension, low sample size situations.

The propagation of the velocity potential fluctuations are governed by the

the vortex comprise the superradiance effect. Particular to this study, a
coordinate transformation is applied which enables the identification of the
event horizon and the ergosphere termwise in the metric. Thus, the respective
spectral solutions can be obtained asymptotically at either boundary. Further,
the time-domain calculations of the energy of the propagating perturbations and
the independently performed reflection coefficient calculations from the
asymptotic solutions of the propagating perturbations are shown to be in very
good agreement. While the former solution provides the full dynamical behavior
of the superradiance, the latter method gives the frequency spectrum of the
superradiance as a function of the rotational frequency of the vortex. Hence, a
comprehensive analysis of the superradiance effect can be conducted within this

cellular automaton that exhibits solitonic behaviour. In this article, we study
the BBS when started from a random two-sided infinite particle configuration.
For such a model, Ferrari et al.\ recently showed the invariance in
distribution of Bernoulli product measures with density strictly less than
$\frac{1}{2}$, and gave a soliton decomposition for invariant measures more
generally. We study the BBS dynamics using the transformation of a nearest
neighbour path encoding of the particle configuration given by `reflection in
the past maximum', which was famously shown by Pitman to connect Brownian
motion and a three-dimensional Bessel process. We use this to characterise the
set of configurations for which the dynamics are well-defined and reversible
for all times. We give simple sufficient conditions for random initial
conditions to be invariant in distribution under the BBS dynamics, which we
check in several natural examples, and also investigate the ergodicity of the
relevant transformation. Furthermore, we analyse various probabilistic
properties of the BBS that are commonly studied for interacting particle
systems, such as the asymptotic behavior of the integrated current of particles
and of a tagged particle. Finally, for Bernoulli product measures with
parameter $p\uparrow\frac12$ (which may be considered the `high density'
regime), the path encoding we consider has a natural scaling limit, which
motivates the introduction of a new continuous version of the BBS that we
believe will be of independent interest as a dynamical system.

to human induced seismic hazards that are commonly associated with petroleum
activities and wastewater disposal. Recently, there has been a significant
growth in the rate of such earthquakes, especially in areas of Texas, Oklahoma,
and Kansas. The magnitudes of these earthquakes are usually lower than tectonic
earthquakes that can occur in high seismic regions; however, such induced
earthquakes can occur in areas that historically have had negligible
seismicity. Thus, the infrastructure in these locations was likely designed for
no to low seismic demands, making them vulnerable to seismic damage. Ongoing
research is aimed at evaluating the vulnerability bridge infrastructure to
these human induced seismic hazards. In this paper, fragility curves are
developed specifically for steel girder bridges by considering major sources of
uncertainty, including uncertainty in ground motions and local soil conditions
expected in the Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas region, as well as uncertainty in
design and detailing practices in the area. The results of this fragility
analysis are presented herein as a basis for discussion of potential seismic
risks in areas affected by induced earthquakes.

this work, we attempt to shed some light on the audience targeting patterns of
newspapers, using the Chilean media ecosystem. First, we use the gravity model
to analyze geography as a factor in explaining audience reachability. This
shows that some newspapers are indeed driven by geographical factors (mostly
local news outlets) but some others are not (national-distribution outlets).
For those which are not, we use a regression model to study the influence of
socioeconomic and political characteristics in news outlets adoption. We
conclude that indeed larger, national-distribution news outlets target

surface brightness profile and a rise towards the centre in the velocity
dispersion profiles. Similar signatures, however, could result from other
effects, that need to be taken into account in order to determine the presence
(or the absence) of an IMBH in these stellar systems. Following our previous
exploration of the role of radial anisotropy in shaping these observational
signatures, we analyse here the effects produced by the presence of a
population of centrally concentrated stellar-mass black holes. We fit dynamical
models to omega Cen data, and we show that models with ~5% of their mass in
black holes (consistent with ~100% retention fraction after natal kicks) can
reproduce the data. When simultaneously considering both radial anisotropy and
mass segregation, the best-fit model includes a smaller population of remnants,
and a less extreme degree of anisotropy with respect to the models that include
only one of these features. These results underline that before conclusions
about putative IMBHs can be made, the effects of stellar-mass black holes and
radial anisotropy need to be properly accounted for.

Variable selection and model averaging have become extremely important tools
for improving inference and prediction. However, often linear models are not
sufficient and the complex relationship between input variables and a response
is better described by introducing non-linearities and complex functional
interactions. Deep learning models have been extremely successful in terms of
prediction although they are often difficult to specify and potentially suffer
from overfitting. The aim of this paper is to bring the ideas of deep learning
into a statistical framework which yields more parsimonious models and allows
to quantify model uncertainty. To this end we introduce the class of deep
Bayesian regression models (DBRM) consisting of a generalized linear model
combined with a comprehensive non-linear feature space, where non-linear
features are generated just like in deep learning but combined with variable
selection in order to include only important features. DBRM can easily be
extended to include latent Gaussian variables to model complex correlation

existing deep learning approaches. Two different algorithms based on MCMC are
introduced to fit DBRM and to perform Bayesian inference. The predictive
performance of these algorithms is compared with a large number of state of the

  Prediction-Consistent Regularization","10 pages, L@S 2018",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge tracing is one of the key research areas for empowering
personalized education. It is a task to model students' mastery level of a
knowledge component (KC) based on their historical learning trajectories. In
recent years, a recurrent neural network model called deep knowledge tracing
(DKT) has been proposed to handle the knowledge tracing task and literature has
shown that DKT generally outperforms traditional methods. However, through our
extensive experimentation, we have noticed two major problems in the DKT model.
The first problem is that the model fails to reconstruct the observed input. As
a result, even when a student performs well on a KC, the prediction of that
KC's mastery level decreases instead, and vice versa. Second, the predicted
performance for KCs across time-steps is not consistent. This is undesirable
and unreasonable because student's performance is expected to transit gradually
over time. To address these problems, we introduce regularization terms that
correspond to reconstruction and waviness to the loss function of the original
DKT model to enhance the consistency in prediction. Experiments show that the

or single nuclear spins and measure their magnetic resonance (NMR) signal.
However, the spectral resolution, a key feature of NMR, has been limited by
relaxation of the sensor to a few kHz at room temperature. The spectral
resolution of NMR signals from single nuclear spins can be improved by, e.g.,
using quantum memories, however at the expense of sensitivity. Classical
signals on the other hand can be measured with exceptional spectral resolution
by using continuous measurement techniques, without compromising sensitivity.
To apply these techniques to single-spin NMR, it is critical to overcome the
impact of back action inherent of quantum measurements. Here we report
sequential weak measurements on a single $^{13}$C nuclear spin. The back-action
of repetitive weak measurements causes the spin to undergo a quantum dynamics
phase transition from coherent trapping to coherent oscillation. Single-spin
NMR at room-temperature with a spectral resolution of 3.8 Hz is achieved. These
results enable the use of measurement-correlation schemes for the detection of
very weakly coupled single spins.

in Bayesian statistics. Variational Inference (VI) is a popular technique that
achieves tractability by choosing a relatively simple variational family.
Borrowing ideas from the classic boosting framework, recent approaches attempt
to \emph{boost} VI by replacing the selection of a single density with a
greedily constructed mixture of densities. In order to guarantee convergence,
previous works impose stringent assumptions that require significant effort for
practitioners. Specifically, they require a custom implementation of the greedy
step (called the LMO) for every probabilistic model with respect to an
unnatural variational family of truncated distributions. Our work fixes these
issues with novel theoretical and algorithmic insights. On the theoretical
side, we show that boosting VI satisfies a relaxed smoothness assumption which
is sufficient for the convergence of the functional Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm.
Furthermore, we rephrase the LMO problem and propose to maximize the Residual
ELBO (RELBO) which replaces the standard ELBO optimization in VI. These
theoretical enhancements allow for black box implementation of the boosting
subroutine. Finally, we present a stopping criterion drawn from the duality gap
in the classic FW analyses and exhaustive experiments to illustrate the
usefulness of our theoretical and algorithmic contributions.

cognition is not optimized to work well in high-dimensional spaces, these areas
could benefit from interpretable low-dimensional representations. However, most
representation learning algorithms for time series data are difficult to
interpret. This is due to non-intuitive mappings from data features to salient
properties of the representation and non-smoothness over time. To address this
problem, we propose a new representation learning framework building on ideas
from interpretable discrete dimensionality reduction and deep generative
modeling. This framework allows us to learn discrete representations of time
series, which give rise to smooth and interpretable embeddings with superior
clustering performance. We introduce a new way to overcome the
non-differentiability in discrete representation learning and present a
gradient-based version of the traditional self-organizing map algorithm that is
more performant than the original. Furthermore, to allow for a probabilistic
interpretation of our method, we integrate a Markov model in the representation
space. This model uncovers the temporal transition structure, improves
clustering performance even further and provides additional explanatory
insights as well as a natural representation of uncertainty. We evaluate our
model in terms of clustering performance and interpretability on static
(Fashion-)MNIST data, a time series of linearly interpolated (Fashion-)MNIST
images, a chaotic Lorenz attractor system with two macro states, as well as on
a challenging real world medical time series application on the eICU data set.
Our learned representations compare favorably with competitor methods and
facilitate downstream tasks on the real world data.

incomplete. De novo genes and duplicate genes are a key source of new genetic
material on which selection acts. To better understand the origins of these new
gene sequences, we explored the ways that structural variation might alter
expression patterns and form novel transcripts. We provide evidence that
chromosomal rearrangements are a source of novel genetic variation that
facilitates the formation of de novo genes in Drosophila. We identify 52 cases
of de novo gene formation created by chromosomal rearrangements in 14 strains
of D. yakuba. These new genes inherit transcription start signals and open
reading frames when the 5' end of existing genes are combined with previously
untranscribed regions. Such new genes would appear with novel peptide
sequences, without the necessity for secondary transitions from non-coding RNA
to protein. This mechanism of new peptide formations contrasts with canonical
theory of de novo gene progression requiring non-coding intermediaries that
must acquire new mutations prior to loss via pseudogenization. Hence, these
mutations offer a means to de novo gene creation and protein sequence formation
in a single mutational step, answering a long standing open question concerning
new gene formation. We further identify gene expression changes to 134 existing
genes, indicating that these mutations can alter gene regulation. Population
variability for chromosomal rearrangements is considerable, with 2368
rearrangements observed across 14 inbred lines. More rearrangements were
identified on the X chromosome than any of the autosomes, suggesting the X is
more susceptible to chromosome alterations.

point, RG properties of the conformal factor of the metric allow the
construction of a Hilbert space $\mathfrak{L}$ of renormalizable interactions,
non-perturbative in $\hbar$, and involving arbitrarily high powers of the
gravitational fluctuations. We show that diffeomorphism invariance is violated
for interactions that lie inside $\mathfrak{L}$, in the sense that only a
trivial quantum BRST cohomology exists for interactions at first order in the
couplings. However by taking a limit to the boundary of $\mathfrak{L}$, the
couplings can be constrained to recover Newton's constant, and standard
realisations of diffeomorphism invariance, whilst retaining renormalizability.
The limits are sufficiently flexible to allow this also at higher orders. This
leaves open a number of questions that should find their answer at second

mathematical model based on the Maxwell--Cattaneo equation for heat conduction.
The model is formulated in terms of a two-phase Stefan problem. We consider the
cases of the temperature profile being continuous or having a jump across the
solid-liquid interface. The jump conditions are derived from the
sharp-interface limit of a phase-field model that accounts for variations in
the thermal properties between the solid and liquid. The Stefan problem is
solved using asymptotic and numerical methods. The analysis reveals that the
Fourier-based solution can be recovered from the classical limit of zero
relaxation time when either boundary condition is used. However, only the jump
condition avoids the onset of unphysical `supersonic' melting, where the speed
of the melt front exceeds the finite speed of heat propagation. These results
conclusively demonstrate that the jump condition, not the continuity condition,
is the most suitable for use in models of phase change based on the
Maxwell--Cattaneo equation. Numerical investigations show that thermal
relaxation can increase the time required to melt a nanoparticle by more than a
factor of ten. Thus, thermal relaxation is an important process to include in
models of nanoparticle melting and is expected to be relevant in other rapid
phase-change processes.

1D topological superconductors in Majorana nanowire systems by focusing on the
features of the phase-energy relations in a superconducting semiconductor
nanowire with spin-orbital coupling by including different factors operational
in experimental systems, such as short wire length, suppression of
superconducting gap, and the presence of an Andreev bound state. We show that
even in the absence of Majorana zero modes, some non-topological physical
effects can manifest a $4\pi$ periodicity of the phase-energy relation in the
Josephson junction, thus providing a false positive signal for fractional
Josephson effect with no underlying Majorana zero modes. Furthermore, we
consider several scenarios of inhomogeneous chemical potential distributions in
the superconducting nanowire leading to four Majorana bound states and
construct the effective four Majorana model to correctly describe the
low-energy theory of the Josephson effect. In this setup, multiple Majorana
zero modes can also have the $4\pi$ fractional Josephson effect, although the
underlying physics arises from Andreev bound states since two close by Majorana
bound states effectively form Andreev bound states. Our work demonstrates that
the mere observation of a fractional Josephson effect simulating $4\pi$
periodicity cannot, by itself, be taken as the definitive evidence for
topological superconductivity. This finding has important implications for the
ongoing search for non-Abelian Majorana zero modes and efforts for developing

and temporally limited, and thus they are often unable to quantify the full
extent of extreme flood events. Moreover, only missions with a short-repeat
orbit, such as Envisat, Jason-2, or SARAL, could provide meaningful time series
of water level variations directly. However, long or non-repeat orbit missions
such as CryoSat-2 have a very dense spatial resolution under the trade-off of a
repeat time insufficient for time series extraction. Combining data from
multiple altimeter missions into a multi-mission product allows for increasing
the spatial and temporal resolution of the data. In this study, we combined
water level data from CryoSat-2 with various observations from other altimeter
missions in the Mekong River Basin between 2008 and 2016 into one multi-mission
water level time series using the approach of universal kriging. In contrast to
former multi-mission altimetry methods, this approach allows for the
incorporation of CryoSat-2 data as well as data from other long or non-repeat

time, data from tributaries are incorporated. The multi-mission time series
including CryoSat-2 data adequately reflects the general inter-annual flood
behaviour and the extreme floodings in 2008 and 2011. It performs better than
single-mission time series or multi-mission time series based only on
short-repeat orbit data. The Probability of Detection of the floodings with the
multi-mission altimetry was around 80\% while Envisat and Jason-2
single-mission altimetry could only detect around 40% of the floodings
correctly. However, small flash floods still remain undetectable.

  Practice",,"PhD Thesis, Rice University, 2018",,,"cs.LO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Constrained counting and sampling are two fundamental problems in Computer
Science with numerous applications, including network reliability, privacy,
probabilistic reasoning, and constrained-random verification. In constrained
counting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given weighting
function, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained
sampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting
function, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints.
Consequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense
theoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however,
offered either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or
approaches with proven guarantees but poor performance in practice.
  In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic framework for
constrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic
technique of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial
reasoning tools, in particular, SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The
resulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling (UniGen) can handle
formulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from
the prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of
variables. If the initial set of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal
Form (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial Randomized
Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By
exploiting the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the
distribution of solutions in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we
introduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that reduced the size of XOR
constraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much as
two orders of magnitude.

clean devices consisting of membranes of single-layer MoS2 suspended on pillar
arrays. Using Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, we have been able to
extract, separate and simulate the different contributions on the nanoscale and
to correlate these to the pillar array design. This control has been used to
design a periodic MoS2 mechanical membrane with a high reproducibility and to
perform optomechanical measurements on arrays of similar resonators with a
high-quality factor of 600 at ambient temperature, hence opening the way to
multi-resonator applications with 2D materials. At the same time, this study
constitutes a reference for the future development of well-controlled optical
emissions within 2D materials on periodic arrays with reproducible behavior. We
measured a strong reduction of the MoS2 band-gap induced by the strain
generated from the pillars. A transition from direct to indirect band gap was
observed in isolated tent structures made of MoS2 and pinched by a pillar. In
fully suspended devices, simulations were performed allowing both the
extraction of the thermal conductance and doping of the layer. Using the
correlation between the influences of strain and doping on the MoS2 Raman
spectrum, we have developed a simple, elegant method to extract the local
strain in suspended and non-suspended parts of a membrane. This opens the way
to experimenting with tunable coupling between light emission and vibration.

which closely mimics the behavior of the entanglement entropy and can be
defined for all the quantum many body systems. For this purpose, consider a
quantum chain in its ground state and then, take a subdomain of this system
with natural truncated Hamiltonian. Since the total Hamiltonian does not
commute with the truncated Hamiltonian, the subsystem can be in one of its
eigenenergies with different probabilities. Using the fact that the global
energy eigenstates are locally close to diagonal in the local energy
eigenbasis, we argue that the R\'enyi entropy of these probabilities follows an
area law for the gapped systems. When the system is at the critical point, the
R\'enyi entropy follows a logarithmic behavior with a universal coefficient.
Consequently, our quantity not only detects the phase transition but also
determines the universality class of the critical point. Moreover we show that
the largest defined probabilities are very close to the biggest Schmidt
coefficients. We quantify this by defining a {\it{truncated}} Shannon entropy
which its value is almost indistinguishable from the {\it{truncated}} von
Neumann entanglement entropy. Compare to the entanglement entropy, our quantity
has the advantage of being associated to a natural observable (subsystem
Hamiltonian) that can be defined (and probably measured) easily for all the
short-range interacting systems. We support our arguments by detailed numerical
calculations performed on the transverse field XY-chain.

design distributed versions of a machine learning algorithm, whereby local
computations are performed on local data with the output exchanged among
neighbors in an iterative fashion. During this iterative process the leakage of
data privacy arises. A differentially private ADMM was proposed in prior work
(Zhang & Zhu, 2017) where only the privacy loss of a single node during one
iteration was bounded, a method that makes it difficult to balance the tradeoff
between the utility attained through distributed computation and privacy
guarantees when considering the total privacy loss of all nodes over the entire
iterative process. We propose a perturbation method for ADMM where the
perturbed term is correlated with the penalty parameters; this is shown to
improve the utility and privacy simultaneously. The method is based on a
modified ADMM where each node independently determines its own penalty
parameter in every iteration and decouples it from the dual updating step size.
The condition for convergence of the modified ADMM and the lower bound on the
convergence rate are also derived.

MASCARA data for studying variable stars by determining to what extent known
variable stars can be recovered and characterised, and how well new, unknown
variables can be discovered. We used the first 14 months of MASCARA data,
consisting of the light curves of 53 401 stars with up to one million flux
points per object. All stars were cross-matched with the VSX catalogue to
identify known variables. The MASCARA light curves were searched for periodic
flux variability using generalised Lomb-Scargle periodograms. If significant
variability of a known variable was detected, the found period and amplitude
were compared with those listed in the VSX database. If no previous record of
variability was found, the data were phase folded to attempt a classification.
Of the 1919 known variable stars in the MASCARA sample with periods $0.1<P<10$
days, amplitudes $>2\%$, and that have more than 80 hours of data, $93.5\%$ are
recovered. In addition, the periods of $210$ stars without a previous VSX
record were determined, and $282$ candidate variable stars were newly
identified. The O'Connell effect is seen in seven eclipsing binaries, of which
two have no previous record of this effect. MASCARA data are very well suited
to study known variable stars. They also serve as a powerful means to find new
variables among the brightest stars in the sky. Follow-up is required to ensure
that the observed variability does not originate from faint background objects.

In each
experiment, a learner selects an arm $A \in \mathcal{A}$ and obtains an
observation corresponding to $A$. Theoretically, the tight regret lower-bound
for the general bandit is polynomial with respect to the number of arms
$|\mathcal{A}|$. This makes bandit incapable of handling an exponentially large
number of arms, hence the bandit problem with side-information is often
considered to overcome this lower bound. Recently, a bandit framework over a
causal graph was introduced, where the structure of the causal graph is
available as side-information. A causal graph is a fundamental model that is
frequently used with a variety of real problems. In this setting, the arms are
identified with interventions on a given causal graph, and the effect of an
intervention propagates throughout all over the causal graph. The task is to
find the best intervention that maximizes the expected value on a target node.
Existing algorithms for causal bandit overcame the
$\Omega(\sqrt{|\mathcal{A}|/T})$ simple-regret lower-bound; however, their
algorithms work only when the interventions $\mathcal{A}$ are localized around
a single node (i.e., an intervention propagates only to its neighbors).
  We propose a novel causal bandit algorithm for an arbitrary set of
interventions, which can propagate throughout the causal graph. We also show
that it achieves $O(\sqrt{ \gamma^*\log(|\mathcal{A}|T) / T})$ regret bound,
where $\gamma^*$ is determined by using a causal graph structure. In
particular, if the in-degree of the causal graph is bounded, then $\gamma^* =
O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the number $N$ of nodes.

strongly depends on the effective value of $g_{\rm A}$. Using an array of

adversarial-patch-based attack towards mainstream object detectors (i.e. Faster
R-CNN and YOLO). Unlike the original adversarial patch that only manipulates
image-level classifier, our DPatch simultaneously attacks the bounding box
regression and object classification so as to disable their predictions.
Compared to prior works, DPatch has several appealing properties: (1) DPatch
can perform both untargeted and targeted effective attacks, degrading the mAP
of Faster R-CNN and YOLO from 75.10% and 65.7% down to below 1%, respectively.
(2) DPatch is small in size and its attacking effect is location-independent,
making it very practical to implement real-world attacks. (3) DPatch
demonstrates great transferability among different detectors as well as
training datasets. For example, DPatch that is trained on Faster R-CNN can
effectively attack YOLO, and vice versa. Extensive evaluations imply that
DPatch can perform effective attacks under black-box setup, i.e., even without
the knowledge of the attacked network's architectures and parameters.
Successful realization of DPatch also illustrates the intrinsic vulnerability
of the modern detector architectures to such patch-based adversarial attacks.

of high spatial frequency components mainly constituting edges and detailed

layer with a Laplacian filter bank as weights is added to CAEs and the mean

codes in Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are central to healthcare analytics.
Previous work on medical concept embedding takes medical concepts and EMRs as
words and documents respectively. Nevertheless, such models miss out the
temporal nature of EMR data. On the one hand, two consecutive medical concepts
do not indicate they are temporally close, but the correlations between them
can be revealed by the time gap. On the other hand, the temporal scopes of
medical concepts often vary greatly (e.g., \textit{common cold} and
\textit{diabetes}). In this paper, we propose to incorporate the temporal
information to embed medical codes. Based on the Continuous Bag-of-Words model,
we employ the attention mechanism to learn a ""soft"" time-aware context window
for each medical concept. Experiments on public and proprietary datasets
through clustering and nearest neighbour search tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model, showing that it outperforms five state-of-the-art

features that embody the characteristics of the cities. These vectors allow for
the use of multidimensional projection and clustering techniques, enabling a
similarity-based comparison of the street meshes. We experiment with 645 cities
from the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo. Our results show how the joint of global
features describes urban indicators that are deep-rooted in the network's
topology and how they reveal characteristics and similarities among sets of
cities that are separated from each other.

  the Market Fear Factor","21 pages, 3 figures",,,,"q-fin.MF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we establish a link between quantum stochastic processes, and
nonlocal diffusions. We demonstrate how the non-commutative Black-Scholes
equation of Accardi & Boukas (Luigi Accardi, Andreas Boukas, 'The Quantum
Black-Scholes Equation', Jun 2007, available at arXiv:0706.1300v1) can be
written in integral form. This enables the application of the Monte-Carlo
methods adapted to McKean stochastic differential equations (H. P. McKean, 'A
class of Markov processes associated with nonlinear parabolic equations', Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 56(6):1907-1911, 1966) for the simulation of
solutions. We show how unitary transformations can be applied to classical
Black-Scholes systems to introduce novel quantum effects. These have a simple
economic interpretation as a market `fear factor', whereby recent market
turbulence causes an increase in volatility going forward, that is not linked
to either the local volatility function or an additional stochastic variable.
Lastly, we extend this system to 2 variables, and consider Quantum models for
bid-offer spread dynamics.

not. Our new communication technologies make it easy for us to be exposed to
high volumes of true, false, irrelevant, and unprovable information. Future AI
is expected to amplify the problem even more. At the same time, our brains are
reaching their limits in handling information. How should we respond to
propaganda? Technology can help, but relying on it alone will not suffice in
the long term. We also need ethical policies, laws, regulations, and trusted
authorities, including fact-checkers. However, we will not solve the problem
without the active engagement of the educated citizen. Epistemological
education, recognition of self biases and protection of our channels of
communication and trusted networks are all needed to overcome the problem and
continue our progress as democratic societies.
