  Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2018)",,,,"stat.ME math.CV math.OC stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a novel method for model selection in linear regression
by utilizing the solution path of $\ell_1$ regularized least-squares (LS)
approach (i.e., Lasso). This method applies the complex-valued least angle
regression and shrinkage (c-LARS) algorithm coupled with a generalized
information criterion (GIC) and referred to as the c-LARS-GIC method.
c-LARS-GIC is a two-stage procedure, where firstly precise values of the
regularization parameter, called knots, at which a new predictor variable
enters (or leaves) the active set are computed in the Lasso solution path.
Active sets provide a nested sequence of regression models and GIC then selects
the best model. The sparsity order of the chosen model serves as an estimate of
the model order and the LS fit based only on the active set of the model
provides an estimate of the regression parameter vector. We then consider a
source localization problem, where the aim is to detect the number of impinging
source waveforms at a sensor array as well to estimate their
direction-of-arrivals (DoA-s) using only a single-snapshot measurement. We
illustrate via simulations that, after formulating the problem as a grid-based
sparse signal reconstruction problem, the proposed c-LARS-GIC method detects
the number of sources with high probability while at the same time it provides
accurate estimates of source locations.

phase domains during heating and cooling through the transition. In 5 um square
islands this domain development during heating is shown to proceed in three
distinct modes: nucleation, growth, and merging, each with subsequently greater
energy costs. In 0.5 um islands, which are smaller than the typical final
domain size, the growth mode is stunted and the transition temperature was
found to be reduced by 20 K. The modification to the transition temperature is
found by high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy to be due to
a 100 nm chemically disordered edge grain present as a result of ion
implantation damage during the patterning. FeRh has unique possibilities for
magnetic memory applications; the inevitable changes to its magnetic properties
due to subtractive nanofabrication will need to be addressed in future work in

capable of launching accretion disk winds. In X-ray binaries, radiation
pressure is often not significant, as in many systems the luminosity is too low
for driving due to continuum transitions yet too high for driving due to line
transitions. This leaves thermal and magnetic driving as the contender
launching mechanisms in these systems. Using Athena++, we perform axisymmetric
ideal MHD simulations that include radiative heating and cooling processes
appropriate for Compton heated winds to show that the inclusion of magnetic
fields into a thermally driven wind has the opposite effect of what one might
expect: rather than provide a velocity boost, the thermal wind is suppressed in
low plasma beta regions where the field lines are strong enough to reshape the
direction of the flow. Our analysis reveals that magneto-centrifugal launching
is present but weak, while the reduction in wind velocity is not due to the
change in gravitational potential through the magnetically imposed streamline
geometry, but rather due to the increased flow tube area just above the surface
of the disk, which is less conducive to acceleration. Our results suggest that
for magnetothermal wind models to be successful at producing fast dense
outflows in low mass X-ray binaries, the winds must be magnetically launched
well within the Compton radius.

simultaneous planning of multiple trajectories that works in a predictive

to be non-trivial. Oftentimes, intuitive control strategies lead to suboptimal

stability analysis to guide the design of a control scheme for a trailing
vortex flow field aft of a NACA0012 half-wing at an angle of attack $\alpha =
5^\circ$ and a chord-based Reynolds number $Re = 1000$. The stability results
show that the unstable mode with the smallest growth rate (fifth wake mode)
provides a pathway to excite a vortex instability, whereas the principal
unstable mode remains in the wake of the wing. Inspired by this finding, we
perform direct numerical simulations that excite each mode with body forces
matching the shape function from the stability analysis. Relative to the
baseline uncontrolled case, the principal wake mode reduces the vortex length,
while the fifth wake mode further shortens the tip vortex. Analogously, the
streamwise circulation of the trailing vortex is found to be significantly
reduced. From these results, we conclude that a rudimentary linear stability
analysis can provide key insight into the underlying physics and help engineers
design more effective control.

cache-aided broadcast network for correlated content generated by a discrete
memoryless source with arbitrary joint distribution. Each receiver is equipped
with a cache of equal capacity, and the requested files are delivered over a
shared error-free broadcast link. A class of achievable correlation-aware
schemes based on a two-step source coding approach is proposed. Library files
are first compressed, and then cached and delivered using a combination of
correlation-unaware multiple-request cache-aided coded multicast schemes. The
first step uses Gray-Wyner source coding to represent the library via private
descriptions and descriptions that are common to more than one file. The second
step then becomes a multiple-request caching problem, where the demand
structure is dictated by the configuration of the compressed library, and it is
interesting in its own right. The performance of the proposed two-step scheme
is evaluated by comparing its achievable rate with a lower bound on the optimal
peak and average rate-memory tradeoffs in a two-file multiple-receiver network,
and in a three-file two-receiver network. Specifically, in a network with two
files and two receivers, the achievable rate matches the lower bound for a
significant memory regime and it is within half of the conditional entropy of
files for all other memory values. In the three-file two-receiver network, the
two-step strategy achieves the lower bound for large cache capacities, and it
is within half of the joint entropy of two of the sources conditioned on the
third one for all other cache sizes.

are defined by an antisymmetric matrix such that typically some strategies go
extinct over time. Here we show that there also exist topologically robust
zero-sum games, such as the rock-paper-scissors game, for which all strategies
coexist for all choices of interaction strengths. We refer to such zero-sum
games as coexistence networks and construct coexistence networks with an
arbitrary number of strategies. By mapping the long-time dynamics of the ALVE
to the algebra of antisymmetric matrices, we identify simple graph-theoretical
rules by which coexistence networks are constructed. Examples are
triangulations of cycles characterized by the golden ratio $\varphi =
1.6180...$, cycles with complete subnetworks, and non-Hamiltonian networks. In
graph-theoretical terms, we extend the concept of a Pfaffian orientation from
even-sized to odd-sized networks. Our results show that the topology of
interaction networks alone can determine the long-time behavior of nonlinear
dynamical systems, and may help to identify robust network motifs arising, for
example, in ecology.

  View Maintenance",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The property graph data model of modern graph database systems is
increasingly adapted for storing and processing heterogeneous datasets like
networks. Many challenging applications with near real-time requirements --
e.g. financial fraud detection, recommendation systems, and on-the-fly
validation -- can be captured with graph queries, which are evaluated
repeatedly. To ensure quick response time for a changing data set, these
applications would benefit from applying incremental view maintenance (IVM)
techniques, which can perform continuous evaluation of queries and calculate
the changes in the result set upon updates. However, currently, no graph
databases provide support for incremental views. While IVM problems have been
studied extensively over relational databases, views on property graph queries
require operators outside the scope of standard relational algebra. Hence,
tackling this problem requires the integration of numerous existing IVM
techniques and possibly further extensions. In this paper, we present an
approach to perform IVM on property graphs, using a nested relational algebraic
representation for property graphs and graph operations. Then we define a chain
of transformations to reduce most property graph queries to flat relational
algebra and use techniques from discrimination networks (used in rule-based
expert systems) to evaluate them. We demonstrate the approach using our
prototype tool, ingraph, which uses openCypher, an open graph query language
specified as part of an industry initiative. However, several aspects of our
approach can be generalised to other graph query languages such as G-CORE and
PGQL.

for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) typically leads to slow convergence and
poor generalization. On the other hand, large minibatches are of great
practical interest as they allow for a better exploitation of modern GPUs.
Previous literature on the subject concentrated on how to adjust the main SGD
parameters (in particular, the learning rate) when using large minibatches. In
this work we introduce an additional feature, that we call minibatch
persistency, that consists in reusing the same minibatch for K consecutive SGD
iterations. The computational conjecture here is that a large minibatch
contains a significant sample of the training set, so one can afford to
slightly overfitting it without worsening generalization too much. The approach
is intended to speedup SGD convergence, and also has the advantage of reducing
the overhead related to data loading on the internal GPU memory. We present
computational results on CIFAR-10 with an AlexNet architecture, showing that
even small persistency values (K=2 or 5) already lead to a significantly faster
convergence and to a comparable (or even better) generalization than the
standard ""disposable minibatch"" approach (K=1), in particular when large
minibatches are used. The lesson learned is that minibatch persistency can be a
simple yet effective way to deal with large minibatches.

with several Earth masses via gas accretion. We investigate the formation of
such cores via collisional growth from kilometer-sized planetesimals in
turbulent disks. The stirring by forming cores induces collisional
fragmentation and surrounding planetesimals are ground down until radial drift.
The core growth is therefore stalled by the depletion of surrounding
planetesiamls due to collisional fragmentation and radial drift. The
collisional strength of planetesimals determines the planetesimal-depletion
timescale, which is prolonged for large planetesiamls. The size of
planetesiamls around growing cores is determined by the planetesimal size
distribution at the onset of runaway growth. Strong turbulence delays the onset
of runaway growth, resulting in large planetesimals. Therefore, the core mass
evolution depends on turbulent parameter $\alpha$; the formation of cores
massive enough without significant depletion of surrounding planetesimals needs
strong turbulence of $\alpha \gtrsim 10^{-3}$. However, the strong turbulence
with $\alpha \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ leads to a significant delay of the onset of
runaway growth and prevents the formation of massive cores within the disk
lifetime. The formation of cores massive enough within several millions years
therefore requires the several times enhancement of the solid surface
densities, which is achieved in the inner disk $\lesssim 10$AU due to pile-up
of drifting dust aggregates. In addition, the collisional strength $Q_{\rm
D}^*$ even for kilometer-sized or smaller bodies affects the growth of cores;
$Q_{\rm D}^* \gtrsim 10^7 \,{\rm erg/g}$ for bodies $\lesssim 1$ km is likely
for this gas giant formation.

a time-dependent current, $I(t)$, its resistance $R_M(q)$ depends {\it only} on
the charge $q$ that has flowed through it, so that its voltage response is
$V(t)=R_M(q)I(t)$. It has been argued that a clear fingerprint of these ideal
memristors is a pinched hysteresis loop in their I-V curves. However, a pinched
I-V hysteresis loop is not a definitive test of whether a resistor with memory
is truly an ideal memristor because such a property is shared also by other
resistors whose memory depends on additional internal state variables, other
than the charge. Here, we introduce a very simple and {\it unambiguous} test
that can be utilized to check experimentally if a resistor with memory is
indeed an ideal memristor. Our test is based on the duality property of a
capacitor-memristor circuit whereby, for any initial resistance states of the
memristor and any form of the applied voltage, the final state of an ideal
memristor must be identical to its initial state, if the capacitor charge
finally returns to its initial value. In actual experiments, a sufficiently
wide range of voltage amplitudes and initial states are enough to perform the
test. The proposed test can help resolve some long-standing controversies still

a new U line-list. We record high resolution spectra of different HCLs using a
Fourier transform spectrograph: (i) U-Ne, U-Ar, Th-Ne, and Th-Ar lamps in the
spectral range from 500 to 1000 nm and U-Ne and U-Ar from 1000 to 1700 nm; (ii)
we systematically compare the number of emission lines and the line intensity
ratio for a set of 12 U-Ne HCLs; and (iii) we record a master spectrum of U-Ne
to create a new U line-list. Uranium lamps show more lines suitable for
calibration than Th lamps from 500 to 1000 nm. The filling gas of the lamps
significantly affects their performance because Ar and Ne lines contaminate
different spectral regions. We find differences (up to 88 %) in the line
intensity of U lines in different lamps from the same batch. We find 8239
isolated lines between 500 and 1700 nm that we attribute to U, 3379 of which

combination of U-Ne and U-Ar lamps to wavelength-calibrate astronomical

properties. The differences in line strength between different HCLs underline
the importance of characterizing HCLs in the laboratory. The new 3379 U lines
can significantly improve the radial velocity precision of astronomical

In the standard MV, one of the simplest nonequilibrium systems exhibiting an
order-disorder phase transition, spins are aligned with their local majority
with probability $1-f$, and with complementary probability $f$, the majority
rule is not followed. In the noisy MV (NMV), a random spin flip is succeeded
with probability $p$ (with complementary $1-p$ the usual MV rule is
accomplished). Such extra ingredient was considered by Vieira and Crokidakis
[Physica A {\bf 450}, 30 (2016)] for the square lattice. Here, we generalize
the NMV for arbitrary networks, including homogeneous [random regular (RR) and
Erd\""os Renyi (ER)] and heterogeneous [Barabasi-Albert (BA)] structures,
through mean-field calculations and numerical simulations. Results coming from
both approaches are in excellent agreement with each other, revealing that the
presence of additional noise does not affect the classification of phase
transition, which remains continuous irrespective of the network degree and its
distribution. The critical point and the threshold probability $p_t$ marking
the disappearance of the ordered phase depend on the node distribution and
increase with the connectivity $k$. The critical behavior, investigated
numerically, exhibits a common set of critical exponents for RR and ER
topologies, but different from BA and regular lattices. Finally, our results
indicate that (in contrary to a previous proposition) there is no first-order
transition in the NMV for large $k$.

In this paper, we approach the cut norm topology via the weak* topology (when
considering a predual of $L^{1}$-functions). We prove that a sequence
$W_1,W_2,W_3,\ldots$ of graphons converges in the cut distance if and only if
we have equality of the sets of weak* accumulation points and of weak* limit
points of all sequences of graphons $W_1',W_2',W_3',\ldots$ that are weakly
isomorphic to $W_1,W_2,W_3,\ldots$. We further give a short descriptive set
theoretic argument that each sequence of graphons contains a subsequence with
the property above. This in particular provides an alternative proof of the
theorem of Lov\'asz and Szegedy about compactness of the space of graphons. We
connect these results to ""multiway cut"" characterization of cut distance
convergence from [Ann. of Math. (2) 176 (2012), no. 1, 151-219].
  These results are more naturally phrased in the Vietoris hyperspace $K$ over
graphons with the weak* topology. We show that graphons with the cut distance
topology are homeomorphic to a closed subset of $K$, and deduce several
consequences of this fact.
  From these concepts a new order on the space of graphons emerges. This order
allows to compare how structured two graphons are. We establish basic
properties of this ""structurdness order"".

numerous dark matter minihalos, so limits on the minihalo abundance can place
upper bounds on the small-scale primordial power spectrum. In particular, the
ultracompact minihalo (UCMH), a dark matter structure hypothesized to possess a
$\rho\propto r^{-9/4}$ density profile due to its formation at $z\geq 1000$,
has been used to establish an upper bound on the primordial power spectrum at
scales smaller than 2 Mpc. The extreme slope of this density profile amplifies
the observational signals of UCMHs. However, we recently showed via N-body
simulations that the $\rho\propto r^{-9/4}$ density profile does not develop in
realistic formation scenarios, throwing UCMH-derived power spectrum constraints
into question. Instead, minihalos develop shallower inner profiles with
power-law indices between $-3/2$ and $-1$. In this paper, we expand on that
result and discuss its implications. Using a model that is calibrated to
simulation results and predicts halo structures in spiked power spectra based
on their formation times, we calculate new upper bounds on the primordial power
spectrum based on limits on the dark matter annihilation rate within the
Galaxy. We find that despite assuming shallower profiles, this minihalo model
actually yields stronger constraints than the previous UCMH picture owing to
its inclusion of all minihalos instead of only the earliest-forming ones.

the most distant galaxies, on the verge of the Epoch of Reionization. Previous
calculations of the expected number of detected Lya-emitting galaxies (LAEs) at
this redshift did not explicitly take into account the radiative transfer (RT)
of Lya. In this work we combine a theoretical model for the halo mass function
with numerical results from high-res cosmological hydrosimulations with LyC+Lya
RT, assessing the visibility of LAEs residing in these halos. Uncertainties
such as cosmic variance and the anisotropic escape of Lya are taken into
account, and it is predicted that once the survey has finished, the
probabilities of detecting none, one, or more than one are ~90%, ~10%, and ~1%;
a significantly smaller success rate compared to earlier predictions, due to
the combined effect of a highly neutral IGM scattering Lya to such large
distances from the galaxy that they fall outside the observational aperture,
and to the actual depth of the survey being less than predicted. Because the
IGM affects NB and broadband (BB) magnitudes differently, we argue for a
relaxed color selection criterion of NB - BB ~ +0.85. But since the flux is
continuum-dominated, even if a galaxy is detectable in the NB its probability
of being selected as a NB excess object is <~35%. Various properties of
galaxies at this redshift are predicted, e.g. UV and Lya LFs, M*-Mh relation,
spectral shape, optimal aperture, and the anisotropic escape of Lya through
both a dusty ISM and a partly neutral IGM. Finally, we describe and publish a
fast numerical code for adding numbers with asymmetric uncertainties

stars with very short lifetimes, meaning that they explode close to the birth
place of their progenitors. During a short period they become the most luminous
objects observable in the Universe, being perfect beacons to study
high-redshift star-forming regions. To use the afterglow of GRB 161023A at a
redshift $z=2.710$ as a background source to study the environment of the
explosion and the intervening systems along its line-of-sight. r the first
time, we complement UV/Optical/NIR spectroscopy with millimetre spectroscopy
using ALMA, which allows us to probe the molecular content of the host galaxy.
The X-shooter spectrum shows a plethora of absorption features including
fine-structure and metastable transitions of Fe, Ni, Si, C and O. We present
photometry ranging from 43 s to over 500 days after the burst. We infer a
host-galaxy metallicity of [Zn/H] $=-1.11\pm0.07$, which corrected for dust
depletion results in [X/H] $=-0.94\pm0.08$. We do not detect molecular features
in the ALMA data, but we derive limits on the molecular content of
$log(N_{CO}/cm^{-2})<15.7$ and $log(N_{HCO+}/cm^{-2})<13.2$, which are
consistent with those that we obtain from the optical spectra,
$log(N_{H_2}/cm^{-2})<15.2$ and $log(N_{CO}/cm^{-2})<14.5$. Within the host
galaxy we detect three velocity systems through UV/Optical/NIR absorption
spectroscopy, all with levels that were excited by the GRB afterglow. We
determine the distance from these systems to the GRB to be in the range between
0.7 and 1.0 kpc. The sight-line to GRB 161023A shows 9 independent intervening
systems, most of them with multiple components. (Abridged)

low-mass binary stars can result in a close high-mass binary system. The key
ingredient is to allow mass accretion while limiting the gain in angular
momentum. We envision this process as being regulated by an external magnetic
field during infall. Molecular clouds are made to collapse spherically with
material either accreting onto the stars or settling in a disk. Our aim is to
determine what initial conditions are needed for the resulting binary to be
both massive and close. Whether material accretes, and what happens to the
binary separation as a result, depends on the relative size of its specific
angular momentum, compared to the specific angular momentum of the binary. When
we add a magnetic field we are introducing a torque to the system which is
capable of stripping the molecular cloud of some of its angular momentum, and
consequently easing the formation of high-mass binaries. Our results suggest
that clouds in excess of 1000 M$_\odot$ and radii of 0.5 pc or larger, can
easily form binary systems with masses in excess of 25 M$_\odot$ and
separations of order 10 R$_\odot$ with magnetic fields of order 100 {\mu}G

Sgr~A*, in the far infrared. Our measurements were obtained with PACS on board
the \emph{Herschel} satellite at $100~\mathrm{\mu m}$ and $160~\mathrm{\mu m}$.
While the warm dust in the Galactic Centre is too bright to allow for a direct
detection of Sgr~A*, we measure a significant and simultaneous variation of its
flux of $\Delta F_{\nu\widehat{=}160 ~\mathrm{\mu m}} =
(0.27\pm0.06)~\mathrm{Jy}$ and $\Delta F_{\nu\widehat{=}100 ~\mathrm{\mu m}}=
(0.16\pm0.10)~\mathrm{Jy}$ during one observation. The significance level of
the $160 ~\mathrm{\mu m}$ band variability is $4.5\sigma$ and the corresponding
$100 ~\mathrm{\mu m}$ band variability is significant at $1.6\sigma$. We find
no example of an equally significant false positive detection. Conservatively
assuming a variability of $25\%$ in the FIR, we can provide upper limits to the
flux. Comparing the latter with theoretical models we find that 1D RIAF models
have difficulties explaining the observed faintness. However, the upper limits
are consistent with modern ALMA and VLA observations. Our upper limits provide
further evidence for a spectral peak at $\sim 10^{12} ~ \mathrm{Hz}$ and

at the LHC in a comprehensive survey of Standard Model (SM) extensions. LLPs
are a common prediction of a wide range of theories that address unsolved
fundamental mysteries such as naturalness, dark matter, baryogenesis and
neutrino masses, and represent a natural and generic possibility for physics
beyond the SM (BSM). In most cases the LLP lifetime can be treated as a free
parameter from the $\mu$m scale up to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limit of
$\sim 10^7$m. Neutral LLPs with lifetimes above $\sim$ 100m are particularly
difficult to probe, as the sensitivity of the LHC main detectors is limited by
challenging backgrounds, triggers, and small acceptances. MATHUSLA is a
proposal for a minimally instrumented, large-volume surface detector near ATLAS
or CMS. It would search for neutral LLPs produced in HL-LHC collisions by
reconstructing displaced vertices (DVs) in a low-background environment,
extending the sensitivity of the main detectors by orders of magnitude in the
long-lifetime regime. In this white paper we study the LLP physics
opportunities afforded by a MATHUSLA-like detector at the HL-LHC. We develop a
model-independent approach to describe the sensitivity of MATHUSLA to BSM LLP
signals, and compare it to DV and missing energy searches at ATLAS or CMS. We
then explore the BSM motivations for LLPs in considerable detail, presenting a
large number of new sensitivity studies. While our discussion is especially
oriented towards the long-lifetime regime at MATHUSLA, this survey underlines
the importance of a varied LLP search program at the LHC in general. By
synthesizing these results into a general discussion of the top-down and
bottom-up motivations for LLP searches, it is our aim to demonstrate the
exceptional strength and breadth of the physics case for the construction of
the MATHUSLA detector.

observe an unbiased sample of young protostars in a single molecular cloud so
that we can characterize the evolution of protostars. This paper releases the
MASSES 1.3 mm data from the subcompact configuration ($\sim$4$^{\prime\prime}$

well as for the 1.3 mm continuum. We identify the tracers that are detected
toward each source. We also show example images of continuum and CO(2-1)
outflows, analyze C$^{18}$O(2-1) spectra, and present data from the SVS 13

decreasing trend with bolometric temperature (a proxy for age). Typical
C$^{18}$O(2-1) linewidths are 1.45 km s$^{-1}$, which is higher than the
C$^{18}$O linewidths detected toward Perseus filaments and cores. We find that

invariant form by utilizing gluon and quark building blocks which contain
Wilson lines, and are analogous to those used in the soft collinear effective
theory. This leads to several simplifications, in particular significantly
reducing the size of the operator basis, which stream-lines matching and
anomalous dimension calculations at subleading order in the velocity expansion.
Also, soft ghosts no longer couple via potential like interactions to the heavy
quark fields, and hence do not appear until two loops. Furthermore the the
color structures that appear at each order in $\alpha_s$ in the static
potential are only those which should arise according to non-Abelian

$i\varepsilon$ terms in the heavy quark propagator poles carrying soft momenta.
Even though the choice of the direction of the soft Wilson lines in our

choices, and the predicted form of the eikonal poles does influence results at

disc stability' parameter, q, of galaxies within a fully cosmological context

determined by the ratio of disc specific angular momentum to mass. Dark Sage is
well suited to our study, as it includes the numerical evolution of
one-dimensional disc structure, making both j_disc and q predicted quantities.
We show that Dark Sage produces a clear correlation between gas fraction and
j_disc at fixed disc mass, in line with recent results from observations and
hydrodynamic simulations. This translates to a tight q--f_atm sequence for
star-forming central galaxies, which closely tracks the analytic prediction of
Obreschkow et al. The scatter in this sequence is driven by the probability
distribution function of mass as a function of j (PDF of j) within discs,
specifically where it peaks. We find that halo mass is primarily responsible
for the peak location of the PDF of j, at least for low values of q. Two main
mechanisms of equal significance are then identified for disconnecting f_atm
from q. Mergers in the model can trigger quasar winds, with the potential to
blow out most of the gas disc, while leaving the stellar disc relatively
unharmed. Ram-pressure stripping of satellite galaxies has a similar effect,
where f_atm can drop drastically with only a minimal effect to q. We highlight
challenges associated with following these predictions up with observations.

SM-like vector bosons (VBs). Under the theoretical assumption that the NP
couples predominantly to the third generation, previous analyses found that,
when constraints from other processes are taken into account, the S3, U3 and VB
models cannot explain the B anomalies, but U1 is viable. In this paper, we
reanalyze these models, but without any assumption about their couplings. We
find that, even in this most general case, S3 and U3 are excluded. For the U1
model, constraints from the semileptonic lepton-flavour-violating (LFV)
processes $B \to K^{(*)} \mu^\pm \tau^\mp$, $\tau \to \mu \phi$ and $\Upsilon
\to \mu \tau$, which have been largely ignored previously, are found to be very
important. Because of the LFV constraints, the pattern of couplings of the U1
LQ is similar to that obtained with the above theoretical assumption. Also, the
LFV constraints render unimportant those constraints obtained using the
renormalization group equations. As for the VB model, it is excluded if the
above theoretical assumption is made due to the additional constraints from
$B^0_s$-${\bar B}^0_s$ mixing, $\tau\to 3\mu$ and $\tau \to \mu \nu {\bar\nu}$.
By contrast, we find a different set of NP couplings that both explains the $b
\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ anomaly and is compatible with all constraints. However, it
does not reproduce the measured values of the $b \to c \tau^- {\bar\nu}$
anomalies -- it would be viable only if future measurements find that the
central values of these anomalies are reduced. Even so, this VB model is
excluded by the LHC bounds on high-mass resonant dimuon pairs. This conclusion
is reached without any assumptions about the NP couplings.

algorithms. Contrastive Hebbian learning, which is a powerful rule inspired by
gradient backpropagation, is based on Hebb's rule and the contrastive
divergence algorithm. It operates in two phases, the forward (or free) phase,
where the data are fed to the network, and a backward (or clamped) phase, where
the target signals are clamped to the output layer of the network and the
feedback signals are transformed through the transpose synaptic weight
matrices. This implies symmetries at the synaptic level, for which there is no
evidence in the brain. In this work, we propose a new variant of the algorithm,
called random contrastive Hebbian learning, which does not rely on any synaptic
weights symmetries. Instead, it uses random matrices to transform the feedback
signals during the clamped phase, and the neural dynamics are described by
first order non-linear differential equations. The algorithm is experimentally
verified by solving a Boolean logic task, classification tasks (handwritten
digits and letters), and an autoencoding task. This article also shows how the
parameters affect learning, especially the random matrices. We use the
pseudospectra analysis to investigate further how random matrices impact the
learning process. Finally, we discuss the biological plausibility of the

  Recognition","submitted to IEEE SLT 2018",,,,"cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents, in the context of multi-channel ASR, a method to adapt a
mask based, statistically optimal beamforming approach to a speaker of
interest. The beamforming vector of the statistically optimal beamformer is
computed by utilizing speech and noise masks, which are estimated by a neural
network. The proposed adaptation approach is based on the integration of the
beamformer, which includes the mask estimation network, and the acoustic model
of the ASR system. This allows for the propagation of the training error, from
the acoustic modeling cost function, all the way through the beamforming
operation and through the mask estimation network. By using the results of a
first pass recognition and by keeping all other parameters fixed, the mask
estimation network can therefore be fine tuned by retraining. Utterances of a
speaker of interest can thus be used in a two pass approach, to optimize the
beamforming for the speech characteristics of that specific speaker. It is
shown that this approach improves the ASR performance of a state-of-the-art
multi-channel ASR system on the CHiME-4 data. Furthermore the effect of the
adaptation on the estimated speech masks is discussed.

excess, which can be described only by extremizing the existing relations
between the shape of their ultraviolet continuum emission and their

models of star formation and dust distribution. We present an alternative
explanation, based on unveiled AGN activity, to the existence of such galaxies.
In fact, the presence of a weak AGN configures as a natural scenario in order
to explain the observed spectral properties of such high-$z$ objects in terms
of a continuum slope distribution rather than altered infrared excesses, due to
the different shape of the AGN continuum emission with respect to quiescent
galaxies. To this aim, we directly compare the infrared-to-ultraviolet
properties of high-redshift galaxies to those of known categories of AGN
(quasars and Seyferts). We also infer the characteristics of their possible
X-ray emission. We find a strong similarity between the spectral shapes and
luminosity ratios of AGN with the corresponding properties of such galaxies. In
addition, we derive expected X-ray fluxes that are compatible with energetics
from AGN activity. We conclude that a moderate AGN contribution to the UV
emission of such high-$z$ objects is a valid alternative to explain their
spectral properties. Even the presence of an active nucleus in each source
would not violate the expected quasar statistics. Furthermore, we suggest that
the observed similarities between anomalous star-forming galaxies and quasars
may provide a benchmark for future theoretical and observational studies on the
galaxy population in the early Universe.

pseudoscalar, axial and tensor operators. Using recent COHERENT data, we derive
constraints on the corresponding couplings by considering scalar, vector and
tensor quark currents and assuming no lepton flavor dependence. We allow for
mixed neutrino-quark Lorentz couplings and consider two types of scenarios in
which: (i) one interaction at the nuclear level is present at a time, (ii) two
interactions are simultaneously present. For scenarios (i) our findings show
that scalar interactions are the most severely constrained, in particular for
pseudoscalar-scalar neutrino-quark couplings. In contrast, tensor and

We find as well that an extra vector interaction improves the data fit when
compared with the result derived assuming only the standard model contribution.
In scenarios (ii) the presence of two interactions relaxes the bounds and opens
regions in parameter space that are otherwise closed, with the effect being
more pronounced in the scalar-vector and scalar-tensor cases. We point out that
barring the vector case, our results represent the most stringent bounds on

often under-sample the point-spread function, with much of the light landing
within a single pixel. Missions like MOST, Kepler, BRITE, and TESS, do this to
avoid uncertainties due to pixel-to-pixel response nonuniformity. This approach
has worked remarkably well. However, individual pixels also exhibit response
nonuniformity. Typically, pixels are most sensitive near their centers and less
sensitive near the edges, with a difference in response of as much as 50%. The
exact shape of this fall-off, and its dependence on the wavelength of light, is
the intra-pixel response function (IPRF). A direct measurement of the IPRF can
be used to improve the photometric uncertainties, leading to improved
photometry and astrometry of under-sampled systems. Using the spot-scan
technique, we measured the IPRF of a flight spare e2v CCD90 imaging sensor,
which is used in the Kepler focal plane. Our spot scanner generates spots with
a full-width at half-maximum of $\lesssim$5 microns across the range of 400 nm
- 900 nm. We find that Kepler's CCD shows similar IPRF behavior to other
back-illuminated devices, with a decrease in responsivity near the edges of a
pixel by $\sim$50%. The IPRF also depends on wavelength, exhibiting a large
amount of diffusion at shorter wavelengths and becoming much more defined by
the gate structure in the near-IR. This method can also be used to measure the
IPRF of the CCDs used for TESS, which borrows much from the Kepler mission.

wave observations of precessing binaries. We here consider precessing black
hole binaries in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, an effective theory of gravity
that enhances parity violating interactions. We model the black holes as
modified point particles using effective field theory, and derive the
spin-precession equations for a binary system by working within the
post-Newtonian formalism. We find that the spin-spin and quadrupole-monopole
interactions of General Relativity are modified due to an interaction between
the scalar dipoles of the two black holes and the modified black hole
quadrupole as a result of the violation of the no hair theorems. These
modifications enter the precession equations at leading post-Newtonian order.
We further show that these precession equations admit seven constants of motion
when neglecting radiation reaction, with only the mass-weighted effective spin
being modified from General Relativity. We discuss how these may be used to
reduce the precession equations to quadrature and the possibility of
constructing analytic Fourier domain waveforms for generic spin-precessing

two such models, both of which use data on historical wind patterns but apply
different approaches to estimating the extent of wind shedding as a function of
the size of the wind fleet. It is clear from the models that as the wind fleet
increases in size, wind shedding will progressively increase, and as a result
the overall economic efficiency of the wind fleet will be reduced. The models
provide almost identical predictions of the efficiency loss and suggest that
the future upper economic limit of the wind fleet will be mainly determined by
the wind fleet Headroom, a concept described in some detail in the paper. The
results, which should have general applicability, are presented in graphical

integrates data-driven deep learning and model-driven computation to reliably

Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) as the backbone is employed to predict the

the model-driven computation is performed using Cellular Neural Network (CeNN),
a neuro-inspired algorithm to model dynamical systems defined by coupled
partial differential equations (PDEs). CeNN converts the intricate numerical
computation into a series of convolution operations, enabling a trainable PDE
solver. With a feedback control loop, HybridNet can learn the physical
parameters governing the system's dynamics in real-time, and accordingly adapt
the computation models to enhance prediction accuracy for time-evolving
dynamical systems. The experimental results on two dynamical systems, namely,
heat convection-diffusion system, and fluid dynamical system, demonstrate that
the HybridNet produces higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art deep learning

of sub-nanometer-sized molecules (`penetrants') through a stimuli-responsive
polymeric membrane is key to the desired function. In this study, we
investigate the diffusion properties of penetrants ranging from non-polar to
polar molecules and ions in a matrix of collapsed Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAM) polymers in water by means of extensive molecular dynamics
simulations. We find that the water distributes heterogeneously in fractal-like
cluster structures embedded in the nanometer-sized voids of the polymer matrix.
The nano-clustered water acts as an important player in the penetrant
diffusion, which proceeds via a hopping mechanism through `wet' transition
states: the penetrants hop from one void to another via transient water
channels opened by rare but decisive polymer fluctuations. The diffusivities of
the studied penetrants extend over almost five orders of magnitude and thus
enable a formulation of an analytical scaling relation with a clear
non-Stokesian, exponential dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the
penetrant's radius for the uncharged penetrants. Charged penetrants (ions)
behave differently as they get captured in large isolated water clusters.
Finally, we find large energetic activation barriers for hopping, which
significantly depend on the hydration state and thereby challenge available
transport theories.

development are exposing communities to greater risks. Preparation and recovery
are critical for climate change resilience, and social media are being used
more and more to communicate before, during, and after disasters. While there
is a growing body of research aimed at understanding how people use social
media surrounding disaster events, most existing work has focused on a single
disaster case study. In the present study, we analyze five of the costliest
disasters in the last decade in the United States (Hurricanes Irene and Sandy,
two sets of tornado outbreaks, and flooding in Louisiana) through the lens of
Twitter. In particular, we explore the frequency of both generic and specific
food-security related terms, and quantify the relationship between network size
and Twitter activity during disasters. We find differences in tweet volume for
keywords depending on disaster type, with people using Twitter more frequently
in preparation for Hurricanes, and for real-time or recovery information for
tornado and flooding events. Further, we find that people share a host of
general disaster and specific preparation and recovery terms during these
events. Finally, we find that among all account types, individuals with
""average"" sized networks are most likely to share information during these
disasters, and in most cases, do so more frequently than normal. This suggests
that around disasters, an ideal form of social contagion is being engaged in
which average people rather than outsized influentials are key to
communication. These results provide important context for the type of disaster
information and target audiences that may be most useful for disaster
communication during varying extreme events.

observations at 74 MHz from the VLA Low-Frequency Sky Survey Redux. Earlier,
higher frequency radio continuum, recombination line, and infrared data had
correctly inferred the presence of nonthermal radio emission within a large
complex including ionised nebulae and active star formation. However, our
observations have allowed us to redefine at least one SNR as a relatively small
source (7'.5 x 3' in size) located at the southern periphery of the originally
defined SNR candidate. The integrated flux density of G51.04 at 74 MHz is 6.1
+/- 0.8 Jy, while its radio continuum spectrum has a slope alpha=-0.52 +/-
0.05, typical of a shell-type remnant. We also measured spatial variations in
the spectral index between 74 and 1400~MHz across the source, ranging from a
steeper spectrum (alpha~-0.50) coincident with the brightest emission to a
flatter component (alpha~-0.30) in the surrounding fainter region. To probe the
interstellar medium into which the redefined SNR is likely evolving, we have
analysed the surrounding atomic and molecular gas using the 21~cm neutral
hydrogen (HI) and 13CO (J=1-0) emissions. We found that G51.04 is confined
within an HI cavity and that its radio emission is consistent with the remains
of a stellar explosion that occurred ~6300 yr ago at a distance of ~7.7 kpc.
Kinematic data suggest that the newly discovered SNR lies in front of HII
regions in the complex, consistent with the lack of a low frequency turnover in
the continuum spectrum. The CO observations revealed molecular material that
traces the central and northern parts of G51.04. The interaction between the
cloud and the radio source is not conclusive. The relatively low flux density
(~1.5 Jy at 1400 MHz) of G51.04 is consistent with many similar SNRs hidden
along complex lines of sight towards inner Galactic emission complexes.

statistics are easily produced by lasers; however, some applications require
super- or sub-Poissonian statistics. Statistical properties of a light source
are characterized by the second-order coherence function g^(2)(0). This
function distinguishes stimulated radiation of lasers with g^(2)(0)=1 from
light of other sources. For example, g^(2)(0)=2 for black-body radiation, and
g^(2)(0)=0 for single-photon emission. One of the applications requiring
super-Poissonian statistics (g^(2)(0)>1) is ghost imaging with thermal light.
Ghost imaging also requires light with a narrow linewidth and high intensity.
Currently, rather expensive and inefficient light sources are used for this
purpose. In the last year, a superluminescent diode based on amplified
spontaneous emission (ASE) has been considered as a new light source for ghost
imaging. Even though ASE has been widely studied, its photon statistics has not
been settled - there are neither reliable theoretical estimates of the
second-order coherence function nor unambiguous experimental data. Our computer
simulation clearly establishes that coherence properties of light produced by
ASE are similar to that of a thermal source with g^(2)(0)=2 independent of pump
power. This result manifests the fundamental difference between ASE and laser
radiation.

determination of the Hubble constant. After the recent spectacular confirmation
of the method thanks to GW170817 and its optical counterpart, additional
standard siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources are expected
to constrain the Hubble constant to high accuracy. At the same time, improved
constraints are expected from observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB)
polarization and from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) surveys. We explore
the role of future standard siren constraints on $H_0$ in light of expected
CMB+BAO data. Considering a $10$-parameters cosmological model, in which
curvature, the dark energy equation of state, and the Hubble constant are
unbounded by CMB observations, we find that a combination of future CMB+BAO
data will constrain the Hubble parameter to $\sim 1.5 \%$. Further extending
the parameter space to a time-varying dark energy equation of state, we find
that future CMB+BAO constraints on $H_0$ are relaxed to $\sim 3.0 \%$. These
accuracies are within reach of future standard siren measurements from the
Hanford-Livingston-Virgo and the Hanford-Livingston-Virgo-Japan-India networks
of interferometers, showing the cosmological relevance of these sources. If
future gravitational-wave standard siren measurements reach $1\%$ on $H_0$, as
expected, they would significantly improve future CMB+BAO constraints on
curvature and on the dark energy equation of state by up to a factor $\sim 3$.
We also show that the inclusion of $H_0$ constraints from gravitational-wave
standard sirens could result in a reduction of the dark energy figure-of-merit

techniques aim to automatically create a low-dimensional representation of a

topological structures are being learned in the embeddings process. In this
paper, we investigate if graph embeddings are approximating something analogous

found, it could be used to provide a theoretical insight into how graph
embedding approaches function. We perform this investigation by predicting
known topological features, using supervised and unsupervised methods, directly
from the embedding space. If a mapping between the embeddings and topological
features can be found, then we argue that the structural information
encapsulated by the features is represented in the embedding space. To explore
this, we present extensive experimental evaluation from five state-of-the-art
unsupervised graph embedding techniques, across a range of empirical graph

tools from existing methodologies and proposes a framework that achieves high
success ratio in clutter with anytime performance. The idea is to first explore
the lower dimensional end effector's task space efficiently by ignoring the
arm, and build a discrete approximation of a navigation function, which guides
the end effector towards the set of available grasps or object placements. This
is performed online, without prior knowledge of the scene. Then, an informed
sampling-based planner for the entire arm uses Jacobian-based steering to reach
promising end effector poses given the task space guidance. While informed, the
method is also comprehensive and allows the exploration of alternative paths
over time if the task space guidance does not lead to a solution. This paper
evaluates the proposed method against alternatives in picking or placing tasks
among varying amounts of clutter for a variety of robotic manipulators with
different end-effectors. The results suggest that the method reliably provides
higher quality solution paths quicker, with a higher success rate relative to

micromechanical mechanisms of arterial delamination. The objective of this
study was to investigate various failure mechanisms (e.g. failure of collagen
fibers) responsible for arterial interfacial delamination. In-situ tensile
tests of fibers were performed on a micro-tester in the scanning electron
microscope. A 3D unit cell model containing an individual fiber bridging two
arterial tissue layers was constructed. An exponential cohesive zone model
(CZM) was used to assess the stiffening and softening mechanical behaviors of
collagen fiber bundles between the two arterial layers. An anisotropic
constitutive model was implemented for characterizing the mechanical properties
of the amorphous matrix which includes the fibrous cap and the underlying
plaque tissue and a nonlinear elastic model was adopted for characterizing the
mechanical properties of the fibers. The CZM and elastic parameter values of
fibers were identified through an inverse boundary value approach that matches
the load-displacement curves from simulation predictions of tensile test of
collagen fibers with experimental measurements. The identified parameter values
were then used as input in the 3D unit cell model, through which
micromechanical factors affecting the resultant traction-separation relation
for the unit cell were investigated via a parametric analysis. Results of the
parametric analysis showed the applicability of the 3D unit cell model approach

Universe by $z=6$ are not necessarily the same sources that dominate the
meta-galactic UV background at the same redshift. We further show that in our
simulations, the contribution of each type of source to reionization is not
uniform across different gas phases. The IGM, CGM, filaments, ISM, and rarefied
supernova heated gas have all been photoionized by different classes of
sources. Collisional ionisation contributes at both the lowest and highest
densities. In the early stages of the formation of individual HII bubbles,
reionization proceeds with the formation of concentric shells of gas ionised by
different classes of sources, leading to large temperature variations as a
function of galacto-centric radius. The temperature structure of individual HII
bubbles may thus give insight into the star formation history of the galaxies
acting as the first ionising sources. Our explorative simulations highlight how
the complex nature of reionization can be better understood by using our photon
tracer algorithm.

scenarios, the healthy tissue and cancer cells can coexist. When the
competition is aggressive, competitive cells, the so called super-competitors,
expand by killing other cells. Novel cytotoxic drugs and molecularly targeted
drugs are commonly administered as part of cancer therapy. Both types of drugs
are susceptible to various mechanisms of drug resistance, obstructing or
preventing a successful outcome. In this paper, we develop a cancer growth
model that accounts for the competition between cancer cells and healthy cells.
The model incorporates resistance to both cytotoxic and targeted drugs. In both
cases, the level of drug resistance is assumed to be a continuous variable
ranging from fully-sensitive to fully-resistant. Using our model we demonstrate
that when the competition is moderate, therapies using both drugs are more
effective compared with single drug therapies. However, when cancer cells are
highly competitive, targeted drugs become more effective. In this case,
therapies that are initiated with a targeted drug and are exposed to it for a
sufficiently long time are shown to have better outcomes. The results of the
study stress the importance of adjusting the therapy to the pre-treatment
resistance levels. We conclude with a study of the spatiotemporal propagation

  Side-Channels",,,,,"cs.OS cs.AR cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern processors utilize an increasingly large register set to facilitate
efficient floating point and SIMD computation. This large register set is a
burden for operating systems, as its content needs to be saved and restored
when the operating system context switches between tasks. As an optimization,
the operating system can defer the context switch of the FPU and SIMD register
set until the first instruction is executed that needs access to these
registers. Meanwhile, the old content is left in place with the hope that the
current task might not use these registers at all. This optimization is
commonly called lazy FPU context switching. To make it possible, a processor
offers the ability to toggle the availability of instructions utilizing
floating point and SIMD registers. If the instructions are turned off, any
attempt of executing them will generate a fault.
  In this paper, we present an attack that exploits lazy FPU context switching
and allows an adversary to recover the FPU and SIMD register set of arbitrary
processes or VMs. The attack works on processors that transiently execute FPU
or SIMD instructions that follow an instruction generating the fault indicating
the first use of FPU or SIMD instructions. On operating systems using lazy FPU
context switching, the FPU and SIMD register content of other processes or
virtual machines can then be reconstructed via cache side effects.
  With SIMD registers not only being used for cryptographic computation, but
also increasingly for simple operations, such as copying memory, we argue that
lazy FPU context switching is a dangerous optimization that needs to be turned
off in all operating systems, if there is a chance that they run on affected
processors.

additional classification probability outputs to the network to act as

promising results (Dice=0.81, Jaccard=0.70, MAD=1.68 mm, HD=6.53 mm) and showed
a notable improvement in segmentation accuracy over the classic RF and its

State-of-the-art approaches, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),

consider the importance of learning deep local features from each facial
region, even though it is known from face recognition that each facial region
presents different visual aspects, which can also be exploited for face
spoofing detection. In this work we propose a novel CNN architecture trained in
two steps for such task. Initially, each part of the neural network learns
features from a given facial region. Afterwards, the whole model is fine-tuned

assesses left ventricle function and myocardial perfusion for the detection of
coronary artery diseases. Automatic MCE perfusion quantification is challenging
and requires accurate segmentation of the myocardium from noisy and
time-varying images. Random forests (RF) have been successfully applied to many
medical image segmentation tasks. However, the pixel-wise RF classifier ignores
contextual relationships between label outputs of individual pixels. RF which
only utilizes local appearance features is also susceptible to data suffering
from large intensity variations. In this paper, we demonstrate how to overcome
the above limitations of classic RF by presenting a fully automatic
segmentation pipeline for myocardial segmentation in full-cycle 2D MCE data.
Specifically, a statistical shape model is used to provide shape prior
information that guide the RF segmentation in two ways. First, a novel shape
model (SM) feature is incorporated into the RF framework to generate a more
accurate RF probability map. Second, the shape model is fitted to the RF
probability map to refine and constrain the final segmentation to plausible
myocardial shapes. We further improve the performance by introducing a bounding
box detection algorithm as a preprocessing step in the segmentation pipeline.
Our approach on 2D image is further extended to 2D+t sequence which ensures
temporal consistency in the resultant sequence segmentations. When evaluated on
clinical MCE data, our proposed method achieves notable improvement in
segmentation accuracy and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods including
the classic RF and its variants, active shape model and image registration.

that prevents the dividend rate to fall below a certain proportion of its

the optimal Duesenberry's ratcheting consumption problem, studied by Dybvig
(1995) [Review of Economic Studies 62(2), 287-313], in which consumption is
assumed to be nondecreasing. Our problem differs from Dybvig's also in that the
time of ruin could be finite in our setting, whereas ruin was impossible in
Dybvig's work. We formulate our problem as a stochastic control problem with
the objective of maximizing the expected discounted utility of the dividend
stream until bankruptcy, in which risk preferences are embodied by power
utility. We semi-explicitly solve the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
variational inequality, which is a nonlinear free-boundary problem. The optimal
(excess) dividend rate $c^*_t$ - as a function of the company's current surplus
$X_t$ and its historical running maximum of the (excess) dividend rate $z_t$ -
is as follows: There are constants $0 < w_{\alpha} < w_0 < w^*$ such that (1)
for $0 < X_t \le w_{\alpha} z_t$, it is optimal to pay dividends at the lowest
rate $\alpha z_t$, (2) for $w_{\alpha} z_t < X_t < w_0 z_t$, it is optimal to
distribute dividends at an intermediate rate $c^*_t \in (\alpha z_t, z_t)$, (3)
for $w_0 z_t < X_t < w^* z_t$, it is optimal to distribute dividends at the
historical peak rate $z_t$, (4) for $X_t > w^* z_t$, it is optimal to increase
the dividend rate above $z_t$, and (5) it is optimal to increase $z_t$ via
singular control as needed to keep $X_t \le w^* z_t$. Because, the maximum
(excess) dividend rate will eventually be proportional to the running maximum
of the surplus, ""mountains will have to move"" before we increase the dividend
rate beyond its historical maximum.

enforced using the well-known Voigt notation and the displacement and stress
fields inside each cell are obtained element-wise by means of explicit

optimal convergence of the displacement and the stress fields without any

velocities necessary for starflight with the interplanetary and interstellar
medium is considered. Interaction of protons, atoms, and ions at kinetic
energies relative to the spacecraft (MeV per nucleon) is essentially a problem
of sputtering. More problematic is the impact of dust grains, macroscopic
objects on the order of 10 nm ($10^{-21}$ kg) to 1 $\mu$m ($10^{-15}$ kg), the
effects of which are difficult to calculate, and thus experiments are needed.
The maximum velocity of dust grains that can be achieved at present in the
laboratory using electrostatic methods is approximately 100 km/s, two orders of
magnitude below starflight velocities. The attainment of greater velocities has
been previously considered in connection with the concept of impact fusion and
was concluded to be technologically very challenging. The reasons for this are
explained in terms of field emission, which limits the charge-to-mass ratio on
the macroscopic particle being accelerated as well as the voltage potential
gradient of the accelerating electrostatic field, resulting in the accelerator
needing to be hundreds to thousands of kilometers long for $\mu$m-sized grains.
Use of circular accelerators (cyclotrons and synchrotrons) is not practical due
to limitations on magnetic field strength making the accelerator thousands of
kilometers in size for $\mu$m-sized grains. Electromagnetic launchers
(railguns, coilguns) have not been able to produce velocities greater than
conventional gas guns (< 10 km/s). The nearest feasible technologies (tandem
accelerators, macromolecular accelerators) to reach the regime of projectile
mass and velocity of interest are reviewed. Pulsed lasers are found to be the
only facilities able to accelerate condensed phase matter to velocities
approaching 1000 km/s but unlikely to be able to reach greater speeds.

a qualitative factor in any physics-based simulation model must always be due
to some underlying numerical variables. Even when the underlying variables are
many, sufficient dimension reduction arguments imply that their effects can be
represented by a low-dimensional LV. This conjecture is supported by the
superior predictive performance observed across a variety of examples.

their 1D counterparts are $1/4$ and $1/2$, respectively, this simultaneously
reveals that this critical value crucially depends not only on the position BC
but the dimensionality of the structure too. As the 2D Neumann threshold
$\alpha_{TH}^N$ is greater than one half, its R\'{e}nyi uncertainty relation
for the sum of the position and wave vector components
$R_\rho(\alpha)+R_\gamma\left(\frac{\alpha}{2\alpha-1}\right)$ is valid in the
range $[1/2,2)$ only with its logarithmic divergence at the right edge whereas
for all other systems it is defined at any coefficient $\alpha$ not smaller
than one half. For both configurations, the lowest-energy level at $\alpha=1/2$
does saturate R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropic inequalities. Other properties are
discussed and analyzed from the mathematical and physical points of view.

assume is simply-laced. In this paper, we relate the category $\mathcal{O}$
over truncated shifted Yangians to categorified tensor products: for a generic

space in the categorification of a tensor product of fundamental
representations defined by the third author using KLRW algebras. We also give a
precise description of category $\mathcal{O}$ for arbitrary parameters using a
new algebra which we call the parity KLRW algebra. In particular, we confirm
the conjecture of the authors that the highest weights of category
$\mathcal{O}$ are in canonical bijection with a product monomial crystal

for reasoning about relational specifications. However, the system has a
limitation that arises from the fact that it is based on a simply typed logic:
formalizations that are identical except in the respect that they apply to
different types have to be repeated at each type. We develop an approach that
overcomes this limitation while preserving the logical underpinnings of the
system. In this approach object constructors, formulas and other relevant
logical notions are allowed to be parameterized by types, with the
interpretation that they stand for the (infinite) collection of corresponding
constructs that are obtained by instantiating the type parameters. The proof
structures that we consider for formulas that are schematized in this fashion
are limited to ones whose type instances are valid proofs in the simply typed
logic. We develop schematic proof rules that ensure this property, a task that
is complicated by the fact that type information influences the notion of
unification that plays a key role in the logic. Our ideas, which have been
implemented in an updated version of the system, accommodate schematic
polymorphism both in the core logic of Abella and in the executable

frequency source in conjunction with high frequency synthesizers are used to
generate the local oscillator references for the receivers. The intermediate
frequency outputs of each receiver cover 4-8 GHz and are heterodyned to
baseband for digitization within a set of ROACH-2 units then formatted for

(I) Strong Machine-Learning aid. We start from the output of a strong neural
network model, which the annotator can edit by correcting the labels of
existing regions, adding new regions to cover missing objects, and removing
incorrect regions. The edit operations are also assisted by the model. (II)
Full image annotation in a single pass. As opposed to performing a series of
small annotation tasks in isolation, we propose a unified interface for full
image annotation in a single pass. (III) Empower the annotator. We empower the
annotator to choose what to annotate and in which order. This enables
concentrating on what the machine does not already know, i.e. putting human
effort only on the errors it made. This helps using the annotation budget
effectively. Through extensive experiments on the COCO+Stuff dataset, we
demonstrate that Fluid Annotation leads to accurate annotations very
efficiently, taking three times less annotation time than the popular LabelMe
interface.

overcome the misuse of the system for either intrusions into data or overcome

problem by proposing an asynchronous and distributed generalization of the EM
called the Distributed EM (DEM). Using DEM, existing EM-type algorithms are
easily extended to massive data settings by exploiting the divide-and-conquer
technique and widely available computing power, such as grid computing. The DEM
algorithm reserves two groups of computing processes called \emph{workers} and
\emph{managers} for performing the E step and the maximization step (M step),
respectively. The samples are randomly partitioned into a large number of
disjoint subsets and are stored on the worker processes. The E step of DEM
algorithm is performed in parallel on all the workers, and every worker
communicates its results to the managers at the end of local E step. The
managers perform the M step after they have received results from a
$\gamma$-fraction of the workers, where $\gamma$ is a fixed constant in $(0,
1]$. The sequence of parameter estimates generated by the DEM algorithm retains
the attractive properties of EM: convergence of the sequence of parameter
estimates to a local mode and linear global rate of convergence. Across diverse
simulations focused on linear mixed-effects models, the DEM algorithm is
significantly faster than competing EM-type algorithms while having a similar
accuracy. The DEM algorithm maintains its superior empirical performance on a

graphene-boron nitride Moire super-lattice at both quarter and half-filling. A
single-band minimal model with valley contrasting staggered-flux is proposed to
capture the relevant band structure, where the conspiracy of perfect
Fermi-surface nesting and van Hove singularity strongly enhance the valley
fluctuation, leading to inter-valley spiral (IVS) order at half filling. In
this paper, we consider a strong coupling U(1)$_{v}\times $SU(2)$_{s}$
symmetric spin-valley model to obtain the correlated insulating state and the
pairing instability near quarter filling. A significant ingredient in the
strong coupling model is the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya like interaction inherited
from the flux, which breaks not only the valley SU(2)$_{v}$ symmetry but also
the sub-valley spatial reflection symmetry. We discuss all the possible
long-range orders stabilized by the effective spin-valley-exchange
interactions, and it turns out that the flux remarkably enhance the ferro-spin
inter-valley 120$^{\circ}$ order, which shares the same valley feature as the
IVS order. Upon doping, the leading pairing instability lies in the
inter-valley channel with a trigonally warped $p\pm ip$-wave form factor in the
presence of the sub-valley reflection symmetry breaking. Depending on the sign
of Hund's coupling, the total pairing state could be either spin singlet or
triplet. While the spin singlet chiral topological pairing state $(p\pm

motional status and make timely, automated decisions. Prior efforts tried to
control the output of inertial sensors with acoustic signals. However, their
approaches did not consider sample rate drifts in analog-to-digital converters
as well as many other realistic factors. As a result, few attacks demonstrated
effective control over inertial sensors embedded in real systems.
  This work studies the out-of-band signal injection methods to deliver
adversarial control to embedded MEMS inertial sensors and evaluates consequent
vulnerabilities exposed in control systems relying on them. Acoustic signals
injected into inertial sensors are out-of-band analog signals. Consequently,
slight sample rate drifts could be amplified and cause deviations in the
frequency of digital signals. Such deviations result in fluctuating sensor
output; nevertheless, we characterize two methods to control the output:
digital amplitude adjusting and phase pacing. Based on our analysis, we devise
non-invasive attacks to manipulate the sensor output as well as the derived
inertial information to deceive control systems. We test 25 devices equipped
with MEMS inertial sensors and find that 17 of them could be implicitly
controlled by our attacks. Furthermore, we investigate the generalizability of
our methods and show the possibility to manipulate the digital output through
signals with relatively low frequencies in the sensing channel.

Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit, thus connecting them to kernel
methods. We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be
described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the
network function $f_\theta$ (which maps input vectors to output vectors)
follows the kernel gradient of the functional cost (which is convex, in
contrast to the parameter cost) w.r.t. a new kernel: the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK). This kernel is central to describe the generalization features of ANNs.
While the NTK is random at initialization and varies during training, in the
infinite-width limit it converges to an explicit limiting kernel and it stays
constant during training. This makes it possible to study the training of ANNs
in function space instead of parameter space. Convergence of the training can
then be related to the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK. We prove the
positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK when the data is supported on the
sphere and the non-linearity is non-polynomial. We then focus on the setting of
least-squares regression and show that in the infinite-width limit, the network
function $f_\theta$ follows a linear differential equation during training. The
convergence is fastest along the largest kernel principal components of the
input data with respect to the NTK, hence suggesting a theoretical motivation
for early stopping. Finally we study the NTK numerically, observe its behavior
for wide networks, and compare it to the infinite-width limit.

apply a novel streaming data clustering algorithm to the detected news tweets
to form news events. The third and final step is to rank the detected events
based on the size of the event clusters and growth speed of the tweet

their logistics is not well investigated. We propose a resilient scheme for
disaster recovery logistics to co-optimize DS restoration with dispatch of RCs
and MPSs. A novel co-optimization model is formulated to route RCs and MPSs in
the transportation network, schedule them in the DS, and reconfigure the DS for
microgrid formation coordinately, etc. The model incorporates different
timescales of DS restoration and RC/MPS dispatch, the coupling of
transportation and power networks, etc. To ensure radiality of the DS with
variable physical structure and MPS allocation, we also model topology
constraints based on the concept of spanning forest. The model is convexified
equivalently and linearized into a mixed-integer linear programming. To reduce
its computation time, preprocessing methods are proposed to pre-assign a
minimal set of repair tasks to depots and reduce the number of candidate nodes
for MPS connection. Resilient recovery strategies thus are generated to enhance
service restoration, especially by dynamic formation of microgrids that are
powered by MPSs and topologized by repair actions of RCs and network
reconfiguration of the DS. Case studies demonstrate the proposed methodology.

phases. Rocks often have oriented magnetic fabrics, which can be interpreted as
connected to ductile deformation before cementation of the sediment. This paper
reports a novel statistical procedure for simultaneous evaluation of AMS
(Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility) and fault-slip data.The new method
analyzes the AMS data, without linearization techniques, so that weak AMS
lineation and rotational AMS can be assessed that are beyond the scope of
classical methods. This idea is extended to the evaluation of fault-slip data.
While the traditional assumptions of stress inversion are not rejected, the
method recovers the stress field via statistical hypothesis testing. In
addition it provides statistical information needed for the combined evaluation
of the AMS and the mesotectonic (0.1 to 10m) data. In the combined evaluation a
statistical test is carried out that helps to decide if the AMS lineation and
the mesotectonic markers (in case of repeated deformation of the oldest set of
markers) were formed in the same or different deformation phases. If this
condition is met, the combined evaluation can improve the precision of the
reconstruction. When the two data sets do not have a common solution for the
direction of the extension, the deformational origin of the AMS is
questionable. In this case the orientation of the stress field responsible for
the AMS lineation might be different from that which caused the brittle
deformation. Although most of the examples demonstrate the reconstruction of
weak deformations in sediments, the new method is readily applicable to
investigate the ductile-brittle transition of any rock formation as long as AMS
and fault-slip data are available.

control of the manufacturing process in real time. In this work, we use two
laser beams, positioned orthogonally to illuminate the fibre from two sides,
and calculate deviations from the expected geometry by analysing the scattering
pattern. To measure the diffraction pattern we use two 8K linear array
detectors, with the scattered light incident directly on the sensors. Each
detector is capturing approximately 90 degree angular range directly behind the
fibre. The two measurement channels are positioned at different heights. The
scattered pattern is modelled mathematically with finite-element and
Fourier-modal methods, with various diameter and concentricity deviations. The
sensitivities of the changes in the scattering pattern are identified in
respect to these deviations. Since calculations are computationally intensive,
the sensitivities are pre-calculated in advance, and the real-time measurement
is based on pattern recognition. The symmetry of the pattern is used to
differentiate between diameter and concentricity variations. We performed
online measurements with the prototype instrument in production conditions, and
show that this method is sensitive enough to measure deviations of under 1
{\mu}m in diameter and concentricity of the coating layer.

barriers to zero during adiabatic evolution from a false vacuum to a true

transitions. We move beyond mean-field analysis to a fully quantum model of a
spin ensemble undergoing adiabatic evolution in which the spins are mapped to a
variable mass particle in a continuous one-dimensional potential. We
demonstrate the necessary criteria for enhanced mobility or `speed-up' across

Quantum catalysis is exhibited in models where previously thought not possible,
when barriers cannot be eliminated. For the $3$-spin model with secondary

new criteria for defining the Frenkel line in the supercritical region and
builds a robust connection among the preexisting, seemingly inconsistent

second idea is to use between each front-end card and the back-end electronics
a point-to-point link that runs at the relatively low speed that suffices for
the target application. This broadens the possible choices for the physical
media of the communication links, e.g. glass fiber, plastic optical fiber, or

the convex set is obtained by the $p$-sum of finitely many ellipsoids, for any

theory in convex analysis, and generalizes several well-known set-valued
operations such as the Minkowski sum of the summand convex sets (here,
ellipsoids). We derive an outer ellipsoidal parameterization for the $p$-sum of
a given set of ellipsoids, and compute the tightest such parameterization for
two optimality criteria: minimum trace and minimum volume. For such optimal
parameterizations, several known results in the system-control literature are
recovered as special cases of our general formula. For the minimum volume
criterion, our analysis leads to a fixed point recursion over a scalar that
parameterizes the shape matrix of the outer ellipsoid. This recursion is proved
to be contractive, and found to converge fast in practice. We apply these
results to compute the forward reach sets for a linear control system subject
to different convex set-valued uncertainty models for the initial condition and
control, generated by varying $p\in[1,\infty]$. Our numerical results show that
the proposed fixed point algorithm offers more than two orders of magnitude
speed-up in computational time for $p=1$, compared to the existing semidefinite

$p>1$, the reach set computation results reported here are novel. Our results
are expected to be useful in real-time safety critical applications such as
decision making for collision avoidance of autonomous vehicles, where the
computational time-scale for reach set calculation needs to be much smaller

and safe haven. We use a quantile-on-quantile regression approach to capture
the dependence structure between gold returns and changes in uncertainty under
different gold market conditions, while considering the nuances of uncertainty
levels. To capture the core uncertainty effects on gold returns, a dynamic
factor model is used. This technique allows summarizing the impact of six
different indexes (namely economic, macroeconomic, microeconomic, monetary
policy, financial and political uncertainties) within one aggregate measure of
uncertainty. In doing so, we show that the gold's role as a hedge and safe
haven cannot be assumed to hold at all times. This ability seems to be
sensitive to the gold's various market states (bearish, normal or bullish) and
to whether the uncertainty is low, middle or high. Interestingly, we find a
positive and strong relationship between gold returns and the uncertainty
composite indicator when the uncertainty attains its highest level and under
normal gold market scenario. This suggests that holding a diversified portfolio
composed of gold could help protecting against exposure to uncertain risks.

awareness. One important aspect of this situation awareness is an understanding
of the current risk of a driving situation. In this work, we present a novel
approach for the dynamic risk assessment of driving situations based on images
of a front stereo camera using deep learning. To this end, we trained a deep
neural network with recorded monocular images, disparity maps and a risk metric
for diverse traffic scenes. Our approach can be used to create the
aforementioned situation awareness of vehicles of higher automation levels and
can serve as a heterogeneous channel to systems based on radar or lidar sensors

non-player characters (NPCs), called Skilled Experience Catalogue (SEC). The
objective of this mechanism is to approximately match the skill level of an NPC
to an opponent in real-time. We test the technique in the context of a
First-Person Shooter (FPS) game. Specifically, the technique adjusts a
reinforcement learning NPC's proficiency with a weapon based on its current
performance against an opponent. Firstly, a catalogue of experience, in the
form of stored learning policies, is built up by playing a series of training
games. Once the NPC has been sufficiently trained, the catalogue acts as a
timeline of experience with incremental knowledge milestones in the form of
stored learning policies. If the NPC is performing poorly, it can jump to a
later stage in the learning timeline to be equipped with more informed
decision-making. Likewise, if it is performing significantly better than the
opponent, it will jump to an earlier stage. The NPC continues to learn in
real-time using reinforcement learning but its policy is adjusted, as required,
by loading the most suitable milestones for the current circumstances.

characterisation of the properties of the dark energy component thought to be
responsible for the recent acceleration of the universe, including its possible
dynamics. In this work we study phenomenological but physically motivated
classes of models in which the dark energy equation of state can undergo a
rapid transition at low redshifts, perhaps associated with the onset of the
acceleration phase itself. Through a standard statistical analysis we have used
low-redshift cosmological data, coming from Type Ia supernova and Hubble
parameter measurements, to set constraints on the steepness of these possible
transitions as well as on the present-day values of the dark energy equation of
state and in the asymptotic past in these models. We have also studied the way
in which these constraints depend on the specific parametrisation being used.
Our results confirm that such late-time transitions are strongly constrained.
If one demands a matter-like pre-transition behaviour, then the transition is
constrained to occur at high redshifts (effectively in the matter era), while
if the pre-transition equation of state is a free parameter then it is
constrained to be close to that of a cosmological constant. In any case, the
value of dark energy equation of state near the present day must also be very
similar to that of a cosmological constant. The overall conclusion is that any
significant deviations from this behaviour can only occur in the deep matter
era, so there is no evidence for a transition associated with the onset of
acceleration. Observational tools capable of probing the dynamics of the
universe in the deep matter era are therefore particularly important.

  semimartingale model for long-range dependent processes",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we introduce a model, the stochastic fractional delay
differential equation (SFDDE), which is based on the linear stochastic delay
differential equation and produces stationary processes with hyperbolically
decaying autocovariance functions. The model departs from the usual way of
incorporating this type of long-range dependence into a short-memory model as
it is obtained by applying a fractional filter to the drift term rather than to
the noise term. The advantages of this approach are that the corresponding
long-range dependent solutions are semimartingales and the local behavior of
the sample paths is unaffected by the degree of long memory. We prove existence
and uniqueness of solutions to the SFDDEs and study their spectral densities
and autocovariance functions. Moreover, we define a subclass of SFDDEs which we
study in detail and relate to the well-known fractionally integrated CARMA
processes. Finally, we consider the task of simulating from the defining
SFDDEs.

bodies. Crater scaling laws allow us to extract information about the impact
histories on the host bodies. The pi-group scaling laws have been constructed
based on the point-source approximation, dimensional analysis, and the results
from impact experiments. Recent impact experiments, however, demonstrated that
the scaling parameters themselves exhibits complex behavior against the change
in the impact conditions and target properties. Here, we propose an
alternative, fully analytical method to predict impact outcomes based on impact
cratering mechanics. This approach is based on the Maxwell Z-model and the
residual velocity. We present analytical expressions of (1) the proportionality
relation between the ejection velocity and the ejection position, (2) the
radius of a growing crater as a function of time, and (3) the transient crater
radii. Since we focused on obtaining analytical solutions, a number of
simplifications are employed. Due to the simplifications in the strength model,
the accuracy of the prediction in the strength-dominated regime is relatively
low. Our model reproduces the power-law behavior of the ejecta velocity
distribution and the approximate time variation of a growing crater. The
predicted radii under typical impact conditions mostly converge to a region
between the two typical scaling lines by the pi-group scaling laws, strongly
supporting the notion that the new method is one of the simplest ways to
predict impact outcomes, as it provides analytical solutions. Our model could
serve as a quick-look tool to estimate the impact outcome under a given set of
conditions, and it might provide new insights into the nature of impact
excavation processes.

the solution of a G-matrix equation with the input of realistic strong
baryon-baryon potentials, while the final hyperon-nucleon wave functions are
derived analogously from a microscopic T-matrix calculation. The new
{\Lambda}{\Lambda} $\to$ Y N decay rate studied in this work, $\Gamma_{\Lambda

(>100 AU) through disk fragmentation are often perturbed by other clumps or
disk structures, such as spiral arms, and migrate toward the central star on
timescales from a few 10^3 to few 10^4 yr. The migration timescale is slowest
when stellar motion in response to the disk gravity is considered. When
approaching the star, the clumps first gain mass (up to several tens of M_Jup),
but then quickly lose most of their diffuse envelopes through tidal torques.
Part of the clump envelope can be accreted on the central star causing an
FU-Ori-type accretion and luminosity outburst. The tidal mass loss helps the
clumps to significantly slow down or even halt their inward migration at a
distance of a few tens of AU from the protostar. The resulting clumps are
heavily truncated both in mass and size compared to their wider-orbit
counterparts, keeping only a dense and hot nucleus. During the inward
migration, the temperature in the clump interiors may exceed the molecular
hydrogen dissociation limit (2000 K) and the central region of the clump can
collapse into a gas giant protoplanet. We argue that FU-Orionis-type luminosity
outbursts may be the end product of disk fragmentation and clump inward

sufficient inner loop stopping rule) is discussed in the context of a numerical
optimization algorithm consisting of nested primal-dual proximal-gradient
iterations. While the number of inner iterations is fixed in advance,
convergence of the whole algorithm is still guaranteed by virtue of a
warm-start strategy for the inner loop, showing that inner loop ""starting
rules"" can be just as effective as ""stopping rules"" for guaranteeing
convergence. The algorithm itself is applicable to the numerical solution of
convex optimization problems defined by the sum of a differentiable term and
two possibly non-differentiable terms. One of the latter terms should take the
form of the composition of a linear map and a proximable function, while the
differentiable term needs an accessible gradient. The algorithm reduces to the
classical proximal gradient algorithm in certain special cases and it also
generalizes other existing algorithms. In addition, under some conditions of
strong convexity, we show a linear rate of convergence.

be broadly classified in two types: those forming most of their stars before
$z=2$ (${\it fast}$) and those with more extended SFHs (${\it slow}$). The most
precise SFHs are usually derived from deep but not very spatially extended
photometric data; this might alter the ratio of old to young stars when age
gradients are present. Here we correct for this effect and derive the mass
formed in stars by $z=2$ for a sample of 16 Local Group dwarf galaxies. We
explore early differences between ${\it fast}$ and ${\it slow}$ dwarfs, and
evaluate the impact of internal feedback by supernovae (SN) on the baryonic and
dark matter (DM) component of the dwarfs. ${\it Fast}$ dwarfs assembled more
stellar mass at early times and have larger amounts of DM within the half-light
radius than ${\it slow}$ dwarfs. By imposing that ${\it slow}$ dwarfs cannot
have lost their gas by $z=2$, we constrain the maximum coupling efficiency of
SN feedback to the gas and to the DM to be $\sim$10%. We find that internal
feedback alone appears insufficient to quench the SFH of ${\it fast}$ dwarfs by
gas deprivation, in particular for the fainter systems. Nonetheless, SN
feedback can core the DM halo density profiles relatively easily, producing
cores of the sizes of the half-light radius in ${\it fast}$ dwarfs by $z=2$
with very low efficiencies. Amongst the ""classical"" Milky Way satellites, we
predict that the smallest cores should be found in Draco and Ursa Minor, while
Sculptor and Fornax should host the largest ones.

Alongside ISI, inter-link interference (ILI) is also an issue that increases
the total interference for MCvD-based multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)

traditional communication systems, this paper introduces novel IM-based

it is found that this method combats ISI and ILI considerably better than

keying (QMSSK) is also proposed. QMSSK is found to combat ISI considerably well
whilst not performing well against ILI-caused errors. In order to combat ILI
more effectively, another dual-molecule-based novel modulation scheme called
the molecular spatial modulation (MSM) is proposed. Combined with the Gray
mapping imposed on the antenna indices, MSM is observed to yield reliable error

the background gravitational field. Tidal invariants built up with the Riemann
tensor and their derivatives evaluated along the world line of the body are
essential tools to investigate both geometrical and physical properties of the
tidal interaction. For example, one can determine the tidal potential in the
neighborhood of the body by constructing a body-fixed frame, which requires
Fermi-type coordinates attached to the body itself, the latter being in turn
related to the spacetime metric and curvature along the considered world line.
Similarly, in an effective field theory description of extended bodies finite
size effects are taken into account by adding to the point mass action certain
non-minimal couplings which involve integrals of tidal invariants along the
orbit of the body. In both cases such a computation of tidal tensors is
required. Here we consider the case of a spinning body also endowed with a
non-vanishing quadrupole moment in a Kerr spacetime. The structure of the body
is modeled by a multipolar expansion around the ""center of mass line"" according
to the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon model truncated at the quadrupolar order. The
quadrupole tensor is assumed to be quadratic in spin, accounting for rotational
deformations. The behavior of tidal invariants of both electric and magnetic
type is discussed in terms of gauge-invariant quantities when the body is
moving along a circular orbit as well as in the case of an arbitrary
(equatorial) motion. The analysis is completed by examining the associated
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the tidal tensors. The limiting situation of

than single kernel method. However, some empirical studies show that this is
not always true: the combination of multiple kernels may even yield an even
worse performance than using a single kernel. There are two possible reasons
for the failure: (i) most existing MKL methods assume that the optimal kernel
is a linear combination of base kernels, which may not hold true; and (ii) some
kernel weights are inappropriately assigned due to noises and carelessly
designed algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel MKL framework by
following two intuitive assumptions: (i) each kernel is a perturbation of the
consensus kernel; and (ii) the kernel that is close to the consensus kernel
should be assigned a large weight. Impressively, the proposed method can
automatically assign an appropriate weight to each kernel without introducing
additional parameters, as existing methods do. The proposed framework is
integrated into a unified framework for graph-based clustering and
semi-supervised classification. We have conducted experiments on multiple

Rayleigh numbers $1.0\times 10^5$-$1.0\times 10^9$ and Prandtl number $0.709$
support a generalised applicability of the Grossmann-Lohse (GL) theory, which
was originally developed for horizontal natural (Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard)
convection. In accordance with the GL theory, it is shown that the
boundary-layer thicknesses of the velocity and temperature fields in vertical
natural convection obey laminar-like Prandtl-Blasius-Pohlhausen scaling.
Specifically, the normalised mean boundary-layer thicknesses scale with the
$-1/2$-power of a wind-based Reynolds number, where the ""wind"" of the GL theory
is interpreted as the maximum mean velocity. Away from the walls, the
dissipation of the turbulent fluctuations, which can be interpreted as the
""bulk"" or ""background"" dissipation of the GL theory, is found to obey the
Kolmogorov-Obukhov-Corrsin scaling for fully developed turbulence. In contrast
to Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection, the direction of gravity in vertical natural
convection is parallel to the mean flow. The orientation of this flow presents
an added challenge because there no longer exists an exact relation that links
the normalised global dissipations to the Nusselt, Rayleigh and Prandtl
numbers. Nevertheless, we show that the unclosed term, namely the
global-averaged buoyancy flux that produces the kinetic energy, also exhibits
both laminar and turbulent scaling behaviours, consistent with the GL theory.
The present results suggest that, similar to Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection, a
pure power-law relationship between the Nusselt, Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers
is not the best description for vertical natural convection and existing
empirical relationships should be recalibrated to better reflect the underlying
physics.

strictly hyperbolic 2x2 quasilinear hyperbolic systems, we derive new sharp
linear estimates with refined dependence on the source term and control on the
traces of the solution at the boundary. These new estimates are used to obtain
sharp results for quasilinear IBVP and transmission problems, and for fixed,
moving, and free boundaries. In the latter case, two kinds of evolution
equations are considered. The first one is of ""kinematic type"" in the sense
that the velocity of the interface has the same regularity as the trace of the
solution. Several applications that fall into this category are considered: the
interaction of waves with a lateral piston, and a new version of the well-known
stability of shocks (classical and undercompressive) that improves the results
of the general theory by taking advantage of the specificities of the
one-dimensional case. We also consider ""fully nonlinear"" evolution equations
characterized by the fact that the velocity of the interface is one derivative
more singular than the trace of the solution. This configuration is the most
challenging; it is motivated by a free boundary problem arising in

floating object and the water. This problem is solved as an application of the

Several sulfur-bearing molecules are observed in the interstellar
medium and in comets, in strong contrast to protoplanetary disks where only CS,
H$_2$CS and SO have been detected so far. Aims. We combine observations and
chemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to
physical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We
obtained $0.5^{""}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,
SO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.
Using the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool
DiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other
species were derived. Results. Only CS was detected with a derived column
density of $\sim 2-6 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. We report a first tentative
detection of SO$_2$ in DM Tau. The upper limits range between $\sim 10^{11}$
and $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical
model matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \sim
50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species
could be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,
grain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety
of sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of
reactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or
because most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in
comets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO$_2$ ratios require a non-solar C/O
gas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon
rings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to
CS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau
and points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas.

present three fabrication technologies, based on using electron-beam

the nanowires using DC electrical transport at temperatures down to 300 mK. We
demonstrate that a range of different behaviours may be obtained in different
nanowires, including bulk-like superconducting properties with critical-current
features, the observation of phase-slip centres and the observation of zero
conductance below a critical voltage, characteristic of coherent quantum
phase-slips. We observe critical voltages up to 5 mV, an order of magnitude
larger than other reports to date. The different prominence of quantum
phase-slip effects in the various nanowires may be understood as arising from
the differing importance of quantum fluctuations. Control of the nanowire
properties will pave the way for routine fabrication of coherent quantum
phase-slip nanowire devices for technology applications.

different types of diattenuation (polarisation-dependent attenuation of light)
can be observed: In some brain regions, the light is minimally attenuated when
it is polarised parallel to the nerve fibres (referred to as D+), in others, it
is maximally attenuated (referred to as D-). The underlying mechanisms of these
effects and their relationship to tissue properties were so far unknown. Here,
we demonstrate in experimental studies that diattenuation of both types D+ and
D- can be observed in brain tissue samples from different species (rodent,
monkey, and human) and that the strength and type of diattenuation depend on
the nerve fibre orientations. By combining finite-difference time-domain
simulations and analytical modelling, we explain the observed diattenuation
effects and show that they are caused both by anisotropic absorption
(dichroism) and by anisotropic light scattering. Our studies demonstrate that
the diattenuation signal depends not only on the nerve fibre orientations but
also on other brain tissue properties like tissue homogeneity, fibre size, and
myelin sheath thickness. This allows to use the diattenuation signal to
distinguish between brain regions with different tissue properties and
establishes Diattenuation Imaging as a valuable imaging technique.

this implementation, cine images from the static plane are used for motion
monitoring and as image navigators to sort stepped images in the other plane,
producing dynamic 4D image volumes for use in dose reconstruction. A custom
3D-printed target filled with radiochromic FXG gel was interfaced to a dynamic
motion phantom. 4D-SOPI was acquired in a dynamic motion phantom driven by an
actual patient respiratory waveform displaying amplitude/frequency variations
and drifting and in a healthy volunteer. Unique 4D-MRI epochs were
reconstructed from a time series of phantom motion. Dose from a static 4cmx15cm
field was calculated on each 4D respiratory phase bin and epoch image, scaled
by the time spent in each bin, and then rigidly accumulated. The phantom was
then positioned on an Elekta MR Linac and irradiated while moving. Following
irradiation, actual dose deposited to the FXG gel was determined by applying a
R1 versus dose calibration curve to R1 maps of the phantom. The 4D-SOPI cine
images produced a respiratory motion navigator that was highly correlated with
the actual phantom motion (CC=0.9981). The mean difference between the
accumulated and measured dose inside the target was 4.4% of the maximum
prescribed dose. These results provide early validation that 4D-SOPI
simultaneously enables real-time motion monitoring and truth-in-delivery

been widely applied to many safety-critical applications. However, the
robustness of DL systems recently receives great concerns, such as adversarial
examples against computer vision systems, which could potentially result in
severe consequences. Adopting testing techniques could help to evaluate the
robustness of a DL system and therefore detect vulnerabilities at an early
stage. The main challenge of testing such systems is that its runtime state
space is too large: if we view each neuron as a runtime state for DL, then a DL
system often contains massive states, rendering testing each state almost
impossible. For traditional software, combinatorial testing (CT) is an
effective testing technique to reduce the testing space while obtaining
relatively high defect detection abilities. In this paper, we perform an
exploratory study of CT on DL systems. We adapt the concept in CT and propose a
set of coverage criteria for DL systems, as well as a CT coverage guided test
generation technique. Our evaluation demonstrates that CT provides a promising
avenue for testing DL systems. We further pose several open questions and
interesting directions for combinatorial testing of DL systems.

locating buggy source code entities (e.g., files and methods) based on the
content of a bug report. Such IR-based classifiers have various parameters that
can be configured differently (e.g., the choice of entity representation).
Objective: In this paper, we investigate the impact of the choice of the
IR-based classifier configuration on the top-k performance and the required
effort to examine source code entities before locating a bug at the method
level. Method: We execute a large space of classifier configuration, 3,172 in
total, on 5,266 bug reports of two software systems, i.e., Eclipse and Mozilla.
Results: We find that (1) the choice of classifier configuration impacts the
top-k performance from 0.44% to 36% and the required effort from 4,395 to
50,000 LOC; (2) classifier configurations with similar top-k performance might
require different efforts; (3) VSM achieves both the best top-k performance and
the least required effort for method-level bug localization; (4) the likelihood
of randomly picking a configuration that performs within 20% of the best top-k
classifier configuration is on average 5.4% and that of the least effort is on
average 1%; (5) configurations related to the entity representation of the
analyzed data have the most impact on both the top-k performance and the
required effort; and (6) the most efficient classifier configuration obtained
at the method-level can also be used at the file-level (and vice versa).
Conclusion: Our results lead us to conclude that configuration has a large
impact on both the top-k performance and the required effort for method-level
bug localization, suggesting that the IR-based configuration settings should be
carefully selected and the required effort metric should be included in future
bug localization studies.

Accordingly, there is a variety of different approaches described in the

suffers from the same problem. As these cues are directly applied to the
geometry's surface, the display of additional information, such as other

overcome this limitation we propose Void Space Surfaces which utilize the empty

structures without interfering with the spatial data and potentially
superimposed parameter information. Within this paper we introduce Void Space

suggested that the DM interaction is equivalent to an equilibrium spin current

Doppler effect. The model predicts that the DM interaction can be controlled by
spin current injected externally. Here we show that the DM exchange constant
($D$) in W/CoFeB based heterostructures can be modulated with external current
passed along the film plane. At higher current, $D$ decreases with increasing
current, which we infer is partly due to the adiabatic spin transfer torque. At
lower current, $D$ increases linearly with current regardless of the polarity
of current flow. The rate of increase in $D$ with the current density agrees
with that predicted by the model based on the spin Doppler effect. These
results imply that the DM interaction at the HM/FM interface partly originates

kinematic measurements at 0.4<z<3 from long-slit and integral-field studies. We
investigate several ways to measure halo masses from observations based on
results from semi-analytical models, showing that galaxy halo masses can be
retrieved with a scatter of ~0.4 dex by using only stellar masses. We discover
a third parameter, relating to the time of the formation of the halo, which
reduces the scatter in the relation between the stellar and halo masses, such
that systems forming earlier have a higher stellar mass to halo mass ratio,
which we also find observationally. We find that this scatter correlates with
morphology, such that early-type, or older stellar systems, have higher
M_*/M_halo ratios. We furthermore show using this approach, and through weak
lensing and abundance matching, that the ratio of stellar to halo mass does not
significantly evolve with redshift at 1<z<3. This is evidence for the regulated
hierarchical assembly of galaxies such that the ratio of stellar to dark matter
mass remains approximately constant since $z = 2$. We use these results to show

compactness estimates - in terms of Kolmogorov entropy in ${\bf L}^{1}_{loc}$ -
were established in~\cite{DLG,AON1} for sets of entropy weak solutions
evaluated at a fixed time $t>0$, whose initial data have a uniformly bounded
support and vary in a bounded subset of ${\bf L}^\infty$. These estimates
reflect the irreversibility features of entropy weak discontinuous solutions of
these nonlinear equations. We provide here an extension of such estimates to
the case of scalar conservation laws with a smooth flux function $f$ that
either is strictly (but not necessarily uniformly) convex or has a single
inflection point with a polynomial degeneracy.

Chromodynamics (QCD) processes have emerged in the last decade. In particular,
the role of color flow is now being explored through many different
observables; one such observable is nearly back-to-back hadron correlations in
proton-proton collisions which are predicted to be sensitive to states that are
entangled via their QCD color charge. The PHENIX detector at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider is well suited to study potential effects from color flow.
Angular correlations between nearly back-to-back hadrons or a direct
photon-hadron are measured to study the prediction of color entanglement or
factorization breaking. The correlations can be treated in a
transverse-momentum-dependent framework where sensitivity to non-Abelian
effects from color are predicted. These measurements are the first ever to
search for experimental evidence of these entangled states and will help
establish color flow in hadronic interactions as a new area of focus within QCD
research. Results are presented for proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass
energies of 200 and 510 GeV and proton-nucleus collisions at nucleon-nucleon
center-of-mass energies of 200 GeV. World measurements of processes where
factorization is predicted to hold are also compiled and analyzed to compare to
the new experimental results presented here. The measured results do not
indicate any obvious qualitative differences from observables where
factorization is predicted to hold. This indicates that quantitative
comparisons with phenomenological calculations will be necessary to identify
the magnitude of effects from color entanglement. As QCD is the only
non-Abelian quantum field theory known to exist in nature that admits bound

made in the literature on the design of fog network architecture and
computation offloading. This paper studies an equally important but much less
investigated problem of service hosting where FNs are adaptively configured to
host services for Sensor Nodes (SNs), thereby enabling corresponding tasks to
be executed by the FNs. The problem of service hosting emerges because of the
limited computational and storage resources at FNs, which limit the number of
different types of services that can be hosted by an FN at the same time.
Considering the variability of service demand in both temporal and spatial
dimensions, when, where, and which services to host have to be judiciously
decided to maximize the utility of the Fog computing network. Our proposed Fog
configuration strategies are tailored to battery-powered FNs. The limited
battery capacity of FNs creates a long-term energy budget constraint that
significantly complicates the Fog configuration problem as it introduces
temporal coupling of decision making across the timeline. To address all these
challenges, we propose an online distributed algorithm, called Adaptive Fog
Configuration (AFC), based on Lyapunov optimization and parallel Gibbs
sampling. AFC jointly optimizes service hosting and task admission decisions,
requiring only currently available system information while guaranteeing
close-to-optimal performance compared to an oracle algorithm with full future

interest in physics, which has been mainly studied in the purely conservative

been an important focus of interest in the last decade. In a previous work, the
authors studied the effects of a periodic forcing in the decay law of the
survival probability, and they characterized the global properties of escape
dynamics. In the present paper, we add two important issues in the effects of
periodic forcing: the fractal dimension of the set of singularities in the
scattering function, and the unpredictability of the exit basins, which is
estimated by using the concept of basin entropy. Both the fractal dimension and
the basin entropy exhibit a resonant-like decrease as the forcing frequency
increases. We provide a theoretical reasoning, which could justify this
decreasing in the fractality near the main resonant frequency, that appears for
$\omega \approx 1$. We attribute the decrease in the basin entropy to the
reduction of the area occupied by the KAM islands and the basin boundaries when
the frequency is close to the resonance. Finally, the decay rate of the
exponential decay law shows a minimum value of the amplitude, $A_c$, which
reflects the complete destruction of the KAM islands in the resonance. We
expect that this work could be potentially useful in research fields related to
chaotic Hamiltonian pumps, oscillations in chemical reactions and companion
galaxies, among others.

matrix element of an XXX Heisenberg spin chain Hamiltonian eigenstate with a
state with fixed spins. These matrix elements comprise the wave functions of
the Hamiltonian eigenstates. However, as the complexity of the sum grows
rapidly with the length N of the spin chain, the exact wave function in the
continuum limit is too cumbersome to be exploited. In this note we provide an
approximation to the CBA whose complexity does not directly depend upon N. This
consists of two steps. First, we add an anchor to the argument of the
exponential in the CBA. The anchor is a permutation-dependent integral multiple
of 2 pi. Once anchored, the distribution of these arguments simplifies,
becoming approximately Gaussian. The wave function is given by the Fourier
transform of this distribution and so the calculation of the wave function
reduces to the calculation of the moments of the distribution. Second, we
parametrize the permutation group as a map between integers and we bin these
maps. The calculation of the moments then reduces to a combinatorial exercise
on the partitioning into bins. As an example we consider the matrix element
between the classical and quantum ground states.

traditional models of cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization produced with
the 21cmFAST simulation code (Mesinger & Furlanetto 2007, Mesinger et al.

(2) minimum halo virial temperature hosting efficient star-forming galaxies
($T^{\rm min}_{\rm vir}$), (3) integrated soft-band X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm
X\,<\,2\,keV}/{\rm SFR}$), and (4) minimum X-ray energy escaping the first
galaxies ($E_{0}$), corresponding to a typical H${\rm \scriptstyle I}$ column
density for attenuation through the interstellar medium. The High-Band spectrum
disfavors high values of $T^{\rm min}_{\rm vir}$ and $\zeta$, which correspond
to signals with late absorption troughs and sharp reionization transitions. It
also disfavors intermediate values of $L_{\rm X\,<\,2\,keV}/{\rm SFR}$, which
produce relatively deep and narrow troughs within the band. Specifically, we
rule out $39.4<\log_{10}\left(L_{\rm X\,<\,2\,keV}/{\rm SFR}\right)<39.8$

electron scattering optical depth from Planck and the hydrogen neutral fraction
from high-$z$ quasars. This produces a lower degeneracy between $\zeta$ and
$T^{\rm min}_{\rm vir}$ than that reported in Greig & Mesinger (2017a) using

general linear group arise naturally from the quantum Fock space representation
of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n))$ introduced by Kashiwara, Miwa and Stern
(KMS). We arrive at this connection by reconsidering solvable lattice models
known as `metaplectic ice' whose partition functions are metaplectic Whittaker
functions. First, we show that a certain Hecke action on metaplectic Whittaker
coinvariants agrees (up to twisting) with a Hecke action of Ginzburg,
Reshetikhin, and Vasserot. This allows us to expand the framework of KMS by
Drinfeld twisting to introduce Gauss sums into the quantum wedge, which are
necessary for connections to metaplectic forms. Our main theorem interprets the
row transfer matrices of this ice model as `half' vertex operators on quantum
Fock space that intertwine with the action of
$U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n))$.
  In the process, we introduce new symmetric functions termed
\textit{metaplectic symmetric functions} and explain how they relate to
Whittaker functions on an $n$-fold metaplectic cover of GL$_r$. These resemble
\textit{LLT polynomials} introduced by Lascoux, Leclerc and Thibon; in fact the
metaplectic symmetric functions are (up to twisting) specializations of
\textit{supersymmetric LLT polynomials} defined by Lam. Indeed Lam constructed
families of symmetric functions from Heisenberg algebra actions on the Fock
space commuting with the $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n))$-action. We explain
that half vertex operators agree with Lam's construction and this
interpretation allows for many new identities for metaplectic symmetric and
Whittaker functions, including Cauchy identities. While both metaplectic
symmetric functions and LLT polynomials can be related to vertex operators on

  Multi-Contrast MR Images - A Comparison of CycleGAN and UNIT",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In medical imaging, a general problem is that it is costly and time consuming
to collect high quality data from healthy and diseased subjects. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) is a deep learning method that has been developed
for synthesizing data. GANs can thereby be used to generate more realistic
training data, to improve classification performance of machine learning
algorithms. Another application of GANs is image-to-image translations, e.g.
generating magnetic resonance (MR) images from computed tomography (CT) images,
which can be used to obtain multimodal datasets from a single modality. Here,
we evaluate two unsupervised GAN models (CycleGAN and UNIT) for image-to-image
translation of T1- and T2-weighted MR images, by comparing generated synthetic
MR images to ground truth images. We also evaluate two supervised models; a
modification of CycleGAN and a pure generator model. A small perceptual study
was also performed to evaluate how visually realistic the synthesized images
are. It is shown that the implemented GAN models can synthesize visually
realistic MR images (incorrectly labeled as real by a human). It is also shown
that models producing more visually realistic synthetic images not necessarily
have better quantitative error measurements, when compared to ground truth
data. Code is available at https://github.com/simontomaskarlsson/GAN-MRI

voltage phase angle difference of the connected buses is essential. However, it
needs special techniques to measure voltage angle difference, which may enlarge
the computational burden of the working controller and hence, may make the
control process slow. In this paper, authors investigate the approximation of
angle difference to zero and its effects on the convergence speed and optimal
solutions of a distributed algorithm. To test this approximation, a distributed
nonlinear algorithm is proposed to optimize the multi-objective function which
includes power loss, voltage deviation and cost of reactive power generation,
by controlling the reactive power generations from distributed generators.
Authors investigate the reasons which may outlaw making this approximation and
finally, propose a condition to make such approximation. Importance of making
this approximation in terms of fast convergence of the algorithms is also
illustrated.

numerical stationary solutions of the Einstein-(complex)-Proca system. These
solitonic can be both stable and form dynamically from generic initial data by
the mechanism of gravitational cooling. In this paper we further explore the
dynamical properties of these solitonic objects by performing both head-on
collisions and orbital mergers of equal mass Proca stars, using fully
non-linear numerical evolutions. For the head-on collisions, we show that the
end point and the gravitational waveform from these collisions depends on the
compactness of the Proca star. Proca stars with sufficiently small compactness
collide leaving a stable Proca star remnant. But more compact Proca stars
collide to form a transient ${\it hypermassive}$ Proca star, which ends up
decaying into a black hole, albeit temporarily surrounded by Proca quasi-bound
states. The unstable intermediate stage can leave an imprint in the waveform,
making it distinct from that of a head-on collision of black holes. The final
quasi-normal ringing matches that of Schwarzschild black hole, even though
small deviations may occur, as a signature of sufficiently non-linear and
long-lived Proca quasi-bound states. For the orbital mergers, the outcome also
depends on the compactness of the stars. For most compact stars, the binary
merger forms a Kerr black hole which retains part of the initial orbital
angular momentum, being surrounded by a transient Proca field remnant; in cases
with lower compactness, the binary merger forms a massive Proca star with
angular momentum, but out of equilibrium. As in previous studies of (scalar)
boson stars, the angular momentum of such objects appears to converge to zero
as a final equilibrium state is approached.

result of strong coupling between a vacuum field of a resonant optical cavity

hard, as it requires materials possessing high oscillator strengths to interact
with the relevant optical mode. Two dimensional transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as promising candidates for
realization of the strong coupling regime at room temperature. However, these
materials typically provide coupling strengths in the range of 10-40 meV, which
may be insufficient for reaching strong coupling with low quality factor
resonators. Here, we demonstrate a universal scheme that allows a
straightforward realization of strong and ultra-strong coupling regime with 2D
materials and beyond. By intermixing plasmonic excitations in nanoparticle
arrays with excitons in a WS2 monolayer inside a resonant metallic microcavity,
we fabricate a hierarchical system with the combined Rabi splitting exceeding
500 meV at room temperature. Photoluminescence measurements of the coupled
systems show dominant emission from the lower polariton branch, indicating the
participation of excitons in the coupling process. Strong coupling has been
recently suggested to affect numerous optical- and material-related properties
including chemical reactivity, exciton transport and optical nonlinearities.
With the universal scheme presented here, strong coupling across a wide
spectral range is within easy reach and therefore exploring these exciting
phenomena can be further pursued in a much broader class of materials.

eigenvalue of $A.$ The nullity (singularity) of $\Gamma,$ denoted by ${\rm
null}(\Gamma),$ is the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue $0$ in the
spectrum of $\Gamma.$ In 1957, Collatz and Sinogowitz \cite{von1957spektren}
posed the problem of characterizing singular graphs. Singular graphs have
important applications in mathematics and science. The chemical importance of
singular graphs lies in the fact that if the nullity for the molecular graph is
greater than zero then the corresponding chemical compound is highly reactive
or unstable. By this reason, the chemists have a great interest in this
problem. The general problem of characterising singular graphs is easy to state
but it seems too difficult. In this work, we investigate this problem for
graphs in general and graphs with a vertex transitive group $G$ of
automorphisms. In some cases we determine the nullity of such graphs. We
characterize singular Cayley graphs over cyclic groups. We show that vertex

a non-thermal behavior for finite time as well as a dependence on the shell's

simultaneously completely remove the performance penalties that are typically
associated to cache-size unevenness. Focusing on the multiple-input
single-output Broadcast Channel, the work first identifies the performance
limits of the extreme case where cache-aided users coincide with users that do
not have caches, and then expands the analysis to the case where both user
groups are cache-aided but with heterogeneous cache-sizes. In the first case,
the main contribution is a new algorithm that employs perfect matchings on a
bipartite graph to offer full multiplexing as well as full coded-caching gains
to both cache-aided as well as cache-less users. An interesting conclusion is
that, starting from a single-stream centralized coded caching setting with
normalized cache size $\gamma$, then adding $L$ antennas allows for the
addition of {up to} approximately $L/\gamma$ extra cache-less users, at no
added delay costs. Similarly surprising is the finding that, {beginning} with a
single-antenna hybrid system (with both cache-less and cache-aided users), then
adding {$L-1$} antennas to the transmitter, as well as endowing the cache-less

we have developed a reference-free and alignment-free machine learning method,
DeepVirFinder, for predicting viral sequences in metagenomic data using deep

sequences discovered before May 2015. Evaluated on the sequences after that

contig lengths. Enlarging the training data by adding millions of purified
viral sequences from environmental metavirome samples significantly improves
the accuracy for predicting under-represented viruses. Applying DeepVirFinder
to real human gut metagenomic samples from patients with colorectal carcinoma
(CRC) identified 51,138 viral sequences belonging to 175 bins. Ten bins were
associated with the cancer status, indicating their potential use for
non-invasive diagnosis of CRC. In summary, DeepVirFinder greatly improved the
precision and recall rates of viral identification, and it will significantly
accelerate the discovery rate of viruses.

with the size of a system or with different temporal scales of activity, nor
how a system maintains its integration as its interacts with its environment.
Here, we show for the first time how measures of information integration scale

approximations from statistical mechanics, we show that information integration
diverges in the thermodynamic limit at certain critical points. Moreover, by
comparing different divergent tendencies of blocks of a system at these

  integration of magnetic measurements",,,,,"physics.ins-det nucl-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The characterization of laboratory plasma instabilities, magnetic
reconnection and turbulence associated phenomena, require the simultaneous
signal sampling from arrays of magnetic sensors (hundreds or even thousands) to
obtain spatial resolution, with several hundred kHz for time resolution.
Magnetic measurements based on pick-up (Mirnov) coil are quite common in
experimental pulsed devices for plasma research, thanks to their simplicity and
reliability. Being the signal from this type of sensor proportional to the time
variation of the magnetic field ($dB/dt$), it has to be time-integrated to
recover the instant value of magnetic field. Depending on the required
integration time usually either analog integrators or chopped integrators are
used. However these solutions tend to limit the frequency bandwidth in the kHz
range, they are not easy to design and build, and require additional fast
channels to directly acquire the $dB/dt$ signal to recover the plasma dynamic
features at higher frequencies. In this paper we evaluate the feasibility of
using a direct single channel precision ADC to allow the simultaneous
acquisition of $dB/dt$ measurements and to provide the integrated B measurement
by means of digital integration on the new RFX-mod2 device. On this purpose we
interfaced an existing ADC-module to a Xilinx Zynq FPGA, in order to evaluate
the intrinsic noise and to investigate the feasible integration window of this
configuration. The result opens the door to a compact, cost-effective and
reliable acquisition system, usable for simultaneous real-time control and
transient signal recording, scalable from tenths to thousands channels,
applicable to a broad class of pulsed plasma experimental devices.

the methodologies into unsupervised and supervised learning. The methods are

to be applicable to simple spectra where the photosphere can be mostly
described by absorptions from single transitions with a single photospheric
velocity. These conditions are plausible for SN spectra obtained shortly after
explosion. Here we show that the method also works well for spectra of
hydrogen-poor (Type I) superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) around peak. Analysis
of high signal to noise spectra leads to clear identification of numerous
spectroscopic features arising from ions of carbon and oxygen, that account for
the majority of absorption features detected in the optical range, suggesting
the outer envelope of SLSN-I progenitors is dominated by these elements. We
find that the prominent absorption features seen in the blue are dominated by
numerous lines of OII, as previously suggested, and that the apparent
absorption feature widths are dominated by line density and not by doppler
broadening. In fact, we find that while the expansion velocities of SLSNe-I
around peak are similar to those of normal SNe, the apparent velocity
distribution (manifest as the width of single transition features) is much
lower (~1500 km/s) indicating emission from a very narrow photosphere in
velocity space that is nevertheless expanding rapidly. We inspect the
controversial case of ASASSN-15lh, and find that the early spectrum of this
object is not consistent with those of SLSNe-I. We also show that SLSNe that
initially lack hydrogen features but develop these at late phases, such as
iPTF15esb and iPTF16bad, also differ in their early spectra from standard
SLSNe-I.

of thin boundary layers poses both modelling and computational challenges. In a
previous paper, we derived simplified electro-neutral (EN) models in one
dimensional space where the thin boundary layers are replaced by effective
boundary conditions. In this paper, we extend our analysis to the two
dimensional case where the EN model enjoys even greater advantages. First of
all, it is much cheaper to solve the EN models numerically. Secondly, EN models
are easier to deal with compared with the original PNP system, therefore it is
also easier to derive macroscopic models for cellular structures using EN
models. The multi-ion case with general boundary is considered, for a variety
of boundary conditions including either Dirichlet or flux boundary conditions.
Using systematic asymptotic analysis, we derive a variety of effective boundary
conditions directly applicable to the EN system for the bulk region. To
validate the EN models, numerical computations are carried out for both the EN

myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Our results show that solving the EN models

necessitates a redesign of the network architecture known as cloud radio access
network (CRAN). The cloud is responsible for coordinating multiple Remote Radio
Heads (RRHs) and scheduling users to their radio resources blocks (RRBs). The
transmit frame of each RRH consists of several orthogonal RRBs each maintained
at a certain power level (PL). While previous works considered a vanilla
version in which each RRB can serve a single user, this paper proposes mixing
the flows of multiple users using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). As
such, the total throughput is maximized. The joint user scheduling and power
adaptation problem is solved by designing, for each RRB, a subgraph in which
each vertex represents potential user-RRH associations, encoded files,
transmission rates, and PLs for one specific RRB. It is shown that the original
problem is equivalent to a maximum-weight clique problem over the union of all
subgraphs, called herein the CRAN-IDNCgraph. Extensive simulation results are

the method achieves substantial performance gains for all system configurations

allows for better tuning of the open-loop responses on the one hand. On the
other, reset control enables a reduction in phase lag and a corresponding
increase in phase margin compared to linear control for similar open loop gain
profile. Hence, the combination of the two control methods can provide
well-tuned open-loop responses that can overcome the fundamental linear control

highly compatible with the industry. The designed CRONE reset controllers are

sequence if $$\{u(kn+i)\}_{n\geq0}=f_i(\mathbf{u}),~(0\leq i< k).$$ %Here we
define $\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}:=\{u(n)v(n)\}_{n\geq0}$ and
$\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}:=\{u(n)+v(n)\}_{n\geq0}$ for any two sequences
$\mathbf{u}=\{u(n)\}_{n\geq0}, \mathbf{v}=\{v(n)\}_{n\geq0}.$
  In this paper, we study the polynomial generated sequences. Assume $k\geq2$
and $f_i(x)=\mathbf{a}_ix+\mathbf{b}_i~(0\leq i< k)$. If $\mathbf{a}_i$ are
$k$-automatic and $\mathbf{b}_i$ are $k$-regular for $0\leq i< k$, then we
prove that the corresponding polynomial generated sequences are $k$-regular. As
a application, we prove that the Hankel determinant sequence
$\{\det(p_{i+j})_{i,j=0}^{n-1}\}_{n\geq0}$ is $2$-regular, where
$\{p(n)\}_{n\geq0}=0110100010000\cdots$ is the characteristic sequence of
powers 2. Moreover, we give a answer of Cigler's conjecture about the Hankel
determinants.

different distributions. Furthermore, diverse data sets, e.g., recorded from
various subjects or tasks, can even exhibit distinct feature spaces. The fact
that data that have to be classified are often only available in small amounts

framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) to prove
the transferability of learned patterns in error-related brain signals across
different tasks. The experiments described in this paper demonstrate the
usefulness of transfer learning, especially improving performances when only

general brain signal characteristics, underlining the transfer of
error-specific information. Furthermore, we could extract similar patterns in
time-frequency analyses in identical channels, leading to selective high signal
correlations between the two different paradigms. Classification on the

Optimization(PSO) and genetic algorithms are being widely employed. However, it
is a general observation that not having right set of particles in the swarm

To address this issue, we propose a novel tunable swarm size approach to
reconfigure the particles in a standard PSO, based on the data sets, in real

Optimization Algorithm (TPSO). It is a wrapper based approach wherein an
Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) classifier is used for identifying influential
feature subset, which is further evaluated by a new objective function which
integrates the Classification Accuracy (CA) with a modified F-Score, to ensure
better classification accuracy over varying population sizes. Experimental
studies on bench mark data sets and Wilcoxon statistical test have proved the
fact that the proposed algorithm (TPSO) is efficient in identifying optimal
feature subsets that improve classification accuracies of base classifiers in

dynamics, where the associated potential is constructed directly from the data.
To introduce a self-consistent potential, we adopt the potential model from the
established Quantum Clustering method. The first step is to use a radial basis
function to construct a density distribution from the data. A potential
function is then constructed such that this density distribution is the ground
state solution to the time-independent Schrodinger equation. The second step is
to use this potential function with the Langevin dynamics at sub-critical
temperature to avoid ergodicity. The Langevin equations take a classical Gibbs
distribution as the invariant measure, where the peaks of the distribution
coincide with minima of the potential surface. The time dynamics of individual
data points lead to different metastable states, which are interpreted as
cluster centers. Clustering is therefore achieved when subsets of the data
aggregate - as a result of the Langevin dynamics for a moderate period of time
- in the neighborhood of a particular potential minimum. While the data points
are pushed towards potential minima by the potential gradient, Brownian motion
allows them to effectively tunnel through local potential barriers and escape
saddle points into locations of the potential surface otherwise forbidden. The
algorithm's feasibility is first established based on several illustrating
examples and theoretical analyses, followed by a stricter evaluation using a
standard benchmark dataset.

generates improved rainfall estimates by combining weather radar with

subject to spatial and temporal uncertainties that compromise high-precision
applications like flash flood forecasting. Windshield wiper measurements from
connected vehicles correct these uncertainties by providing precise information
about the timing and location of rainfall. Using co-located vehicle dashboard
camera footage, we find that wiper measurements are a stronger predictor of
binary rainfall state than traditional stationary gages or radar-based
measurements. We introduce a Bayesian filtering framework that generates
improved rainfall estimates by updating radar rainfall fields with windshield
wiper observations. We find that the resulting rainfall field estimate captures
rainfall events that would otherwise be missed by conventional measurements. We
discuss how these enhanced rainfall maps can be used to improve flood warnings

the multiple components positions for a single system form a superposed renewal
