850$\,\mu$m observations, taken as part of the BISTRO (B-Fields in Star-forming

on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), show that the magnetic field runs
along the length of the pillars, perpendicular to, and decoupled from, the
field in the surrounding photoionized cloud. Using the Chandrasekhar-Fermi
method we estimate a plane-of-sky magnetic field strength of $170-320\,\mu$G in
the Pillars, consistent with their having been formed through compression of
gas with initially weak magnetization. The observed magnetic field strength and
morphology suggests that the magnetic field may be slowing the pillars'
evolution into cometary globules. We thus hypothesize that the evolution and
lifetime of the Pillars may be strongly influenced by the strength of the
coupling of their magnetic field to that of their parent photoionized cloud --
i.e. that the Pillars' longevity results from magnetic support

full information game where n measurements from an uniform distribution are
drawn and a player (knowing n) must decide at each draw whether or not to
choose that draw. The goal is to maximize the probability of choosing the draw
that corresponds to the maximum of the sample. In their calculations of the
optimal strategy, the optimal probability and the asymptotic probability, they
assume that after a draw x the probability that the next i numbers are all
smaller than x is $x^i$; but this fails to recognize that continuing the game
(not choosing a draw because it is lower than a cutoff and waiting for the next
draw) conditions the distribution of the following i numbers such that their
expected maximum is higher then i/(i+1). The problem is now redefined with each
draw leading to a win, a false positive loss, a false negative loss and a
continuation. An exact formula for these probabilities is deduced, both for the
general case of n-1 different indifference numbers (assuming 0 as the last
cutoff) and the particular case of the same indifference number for all cutoffs
but the last. An approximation is found that preserves the main characteristics
of the optimal solution (slow decay of win probability, quick decay of false
positives and linear decay of false negatives). This new solution and the
original Gilbert and Mosteller formula are compared against simulations, and
their asymptotic behavior is studied.

form, exhibit a rich variety of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases and stronger
periodic lattice distortions. While the actual role of nesting has been under
debate, it is well understood that the microscopic interaction responsible for
the CDWs is the electron-phonon coupling. The case of TiSe$_2$ is however
unique in this family in that the normal state above the critical temperature
$T_\mathrm{CDW}$ is characterized by a small quasiparticle bandgap as measured
by ARPES, so that no nesting-derived enhancement of the susceptibility is
present. It has therefore been argued that the mechanism responsible for this
CDW should be different and that this material realizes the excitonic insulator
phase proposed by Walter Kohn. On the other hand, it has also been suggested
that the whole phase diagram can be explained by a sufficiently strong
electron-phonon coupling. In this work, in order to estimate how close this
material is to the pure excitonic insulator instability, we quantify the
strength of electron-hole interactions by computing the exciton band structure
at the level of hybrid density functional theory, focusing on the monolayer. We
find that in a certain range of parameters the indirect gap at
$q_{\mathrm{CDW}}$ is significantly reduced by excitonic effects. We discuss
the consequences of those results regarding the debate on the physical
mechanism responsible for this CDW. Based on the dependence of the calculated
exciton binding energies as a function of the mixing parameter of hybrid DFT,
we conjecture that a necessary condition for a pure excitonic insulator is that
its noninteracting electronic structure is metallic.

(IT) by Bank of Ghana in 2002. In this case, we determine the stability or
otherwise of the relationship between money supply and inflation in Ghana over
the period 1970M1-2016M3 using battery of econometric methods. The empirical
results show an unstable link between inflation and monetary growth in Ghana,
while the final state coefficient of inflation elasticity to money growth is
positive but statistically insignificant. We find that inflation elasticity to
monetary growth has continued to decline since the 1970s, showing a waning
impact of money growth on inflation in Ghana. Notably, there is also evidence
of negative inflation elasticity to monetary growth between 2001 and 2004,
lending support to the adoption of IT framework in Ghana in 2002. We emphasized
that the unprecedented 31-months of single-digit inflation (June 2010-December
2012), despite the observed inflationary shocks in 2010 and 2012, reinforces
the immense contribution of the IT framework in anchoring inflation
expectations, with better inflation outcomes and inflation variability in
Ghana. The paper therefore recommends the continuous pursuance and
strengthening of the IT framework in Ghana, as it embodies a more eclectic
approach to policy formulation and implementation.

without Doppler splitting, as typical for a single-cloud situation. Spectra
from the ESO Diffuse Interstellar Bands Large Exploration Survey (EDIBLES)

high C2 column sightlines, extract the corresponding C2-DIBs and study their
strengths and profiles, and to investigate in detail any sub-structures. The
target selection was made based on profile-fitting of the Sodium doublets and
the detection of C2 lines. The C2 (2-0) Phillips system was fitted using a
physical model of the host cloud. C2 column densities, temperatures as well as
gas densities were derived for each sightline. 18 known C2-DIBs and 8 strong
non-C2 DIBs were extracted towards 8 targets, comprising 7 single-cloud and one
multi-cloud line-of-sights. Correlational studies revealed a tight association
of the former group with the C2 columns, whereas the non-C2 DIBs are primarily
correlated with reddening. We report three new weak diffuse band candidates. We
show for the first time that at least 14 C2-DIBs exhibit spectral
sub-structures which are consistent with unresolved rotational branches of
molecular carriers. The variability of their peak separations among the bands
for a given sightline implies that their carriers are different molecules with
quite different sizes. We also illustrate how profiles of the same DIB vary

examine the cost of the physical implementation of the Trotterization, i.e. the

drawn. One is that number of required steps grows much more slowly than system
size if the number of the non-zero matrix elements of Hamiltonian is not too

morphology and properties of the matrix and can produce highly organized hybrid
materials. The resulting material properties depend not only on the polymer
composition but also on the size, shape, and surface properties of the
colloids. The dynamics of this kind of systems using a hybrid mesoscopic
approach has been studied in this work. A continuum description for the polymer
is used, while colloids are individually resolved. The method allows for a
variable preference of the colloids, which can have different sizes, to the
different components the block copolymer is made of. The impact that the
nanoparticle preference for either, both, or none of the blocks has on the
collective properties of nanoparticle-block copolymer composites can be
analyzed. Several experimental results are reproduced covering colloid-induced
phase transition, particles' placement within the matrix, and the role of
incompatibilities between colloids and monomers.

  European Mathematical Society (JEMS)",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We compute the subgroup of the monodromy group of a generalized Kummer
variety associated to equivalences of derived categories of abelian surfaces.
The result was previously announced in arXiv:1201.0031. Mongardi showed that
the subgroup constructed here is in fact the whole monodromy group. As an
application we prove the Hodge conjecture for the generic abelian fourfold of
Weil type with complex multiplication by an arbitrary imaginary quadratic
number field K, but only for polarizations with discriminant 1. The latter
result is inspired by a recent observation of O'Grady that the third
intermediate Jacobians of smooth projective varieties of generalized Kummer
deformation type form complete families of abelian fourfolds of Weil type.
Finally, we prove the surjectivity of the Abel-Jacobi map from the Chow group
of co-dimension two algebraic cycles homologous to zero on every projective
irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold Y of Kummer type onto the third
intermediate Jacobian of Y, as predicted by the generalized Hodge Conjecture.

out-of-plane spin accumulation via the anomalous spin Hall effect (ASHE), where
the direction of the spin accumulation can be controlled by manipulating the
magnetization of the ferromagnet. This mechanism is distinct from the spin Hall
effect (SHE), where the spin accumulation is created along a fixed direction
parallel to an interface. We demonstrate this unique property of the ASHE in
nanowires made of permalloy (Py), to inject and detect out-of-plane spin
accumulation in a magnetic insulator, yttrium iron garnet (YIG). We show that
the efficiency for the injection/detection of out-of-plane spins can be up to
50% of that of in-plane spins. We further report the possibility to detect spin
currents parallel to the Py/YIG interface for spins fully oriented in the
out-of-plane direction, resulting in a sign reversal of the non-local magnon
spin signal. The new mechanisms that we have demonstrated are highly relevant
for spin torque devices and applications.

  Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","10.1109/TBME.2017.2785401",,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: This work investigates the hypothesis that focal seizures can be
predicted using scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Our first aim is to
learn features that distinguish between the interictal and preictal regions.
The second aim is to define a prediction horizon in which the prediction is as
accurate and as early as possible, clearly two competing objectives. Methods:
Convolutional filters on the wavelet transformation of the EEG signal are used
to define and learn quantitative signatures for each period: interictal,
preictal, and ictal. The optimal seizure prediction horizon is also learned
from the data as opposed to making an a priori assumption. Results:
Computational solutions to the optimization problem indicate a ten-minute
seizure prediction horizon. This result is verified by measuring
Kullback-Leibler divergence on the distributions of the automatically extracted
features. Conclusion: The results on the EEG database of 204 recordings
demonstrate that (i) the preictal phase transition occurs approximately ten
minutes before seizure onset, and (ii) the prediction results on the test set
are promising, with a sensitivity of 87.8% and a low false prediction rate of
0.142 FP/h. Our results significantly outperform a random predictor and other
seizure prediction algorithms. Significance: We demonstrate that a robust set
of features can be learned from scalp EEG that characterize the preictal state
of focal seizures.

interestingly, the Cs2Mo3As3 superconductor exhibits much higher upper critical

  results are unchanged compared to previous versions. Data behind the figures,

detectors observed a low-mass compact binary inspiral. The initial sky
localization of the source of the gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, allowed
electromagnetic observatories to identify NGC 4993 as the host galaxy. In this
work, we improve initial estimates of the binary's properties, including
component masses, spins, and tidal parameters, using the known source location,
improved modeling, and recalibrated Virgo data. We extend the range of
gravitational-wave frequencies considered down to 23 Hz, compared to 30 Hz in
the initial analysis. We also compare results inferred using several signal
models, which are more accurate and incorporate additional physical effects as
compared to the initial analysis. We improve the localization of the
gravitational-wave source to a 90% credible region of $16~\mathrm{deg}^2$. We
find tighter constraints on the masses, spins, and tidal parameters, and
continue to find no evidence for nonzero component spins. The component masses
are inferred to lie between 1.00 and 1.89 $M_\odot$ when allowing for large
component spins, and to lie between 1.16 and 1.60 $M_\odot$ (with a total mass
$2.73^{+0.04}_{-0.01} \, M_\odot$) when the spins are restricted to be within
the range observed in Galactic binary neutron stars. Under minimal assumptions
about the nature of the compact objects, our constraints for the tidal
deformability parameter $\tilde \Lambda$ are $(0,630)$ when we allow for large
component spins, and $300^{+420}_{-230}$ (using a 90% highest posterior density
interval) when restricting the magnitude of the component spins, ruling out
several equation-of-state models at the 90% credible level. Finally, with LIGO
and GEO600 data, we use a Bayesian analysis to place upper limits on the
amplitude and spectral energy density of a possible post-merger signal.

detection of gravitational waves from the coalescence of a neutron star binary
system. The detection of this gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, offers a
novel opportunity to directly probe the properties of matter at the extreme
conditions found in the interior of these stars. The initial,
minimal-assumption analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data placed constraints on
the tidal effects of the coalescing bodies, which were then translated to
constraints on neutron star radii. Here, we expand upon previous analyses by
working under the hypothesis that both bodies were neutron stars that are
described by the same equation of state and have spins within the range
observed in Galactic binary neutron stars. Our analysis employs two methods:
the use of equation-of-state-insensitive relations between various macroscopic
properties of the neutron stars and the use of an efficient parametrization of
the defining function $p(\rho)$ of the equation of state itself. From the LIGO
and Virgo data alone and the first method, we measure the two neutron star
radii as $R_1=10.8^{+2.0}_{-1.7}$ km for the heavier star and $R_2=
10.7^{+2.1}_{-1.5}$ km for the lighter star at the 90% credible level. If we
additionally require that the equation of state supports neutron stars with
masses larger than $1.97 \,M_\odot$ as required from electromagnetic
observations and employ the equation-of-state parametrization, we further
constrain $R_1= 11.9^{+1.4}_{-1.4}$ km and $R_2= 11.9^{+1.4}_{-1.4}$ km at the
90% credible level. Finally, we obtain constraints on $p(\rho)$ at supranuclear
densities, with pressure at twice nuclear saturation density measured at
$3.5^{+2.7}_{-1.7}\times 10^{34} \,\mathrm{dyn}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ at the 90%
level.

ultraluminous infrared galaxy Mrk273 and its outflow, we used the NOEMA
interferometer to image the dense gas molecular tracers HCN, HCO+, HNC, HOC+
and HC3N at 86GHz and 256GHz with angular resolutions of 4.9x4.5 arcsec
(3.7x3.4 kpc) and 0.61x0.55 arcsec (460x420 pc). We also modelled the flux of
several H2O lines observed with Herschel using a radiative transfer code that
includes excitation by collisions as well as by far-infrared photons. The disk
of the Mrk273 north nucleus has two components with decoupled kinematics. The
gas in the outer parts (1.5 kpc) rotates with a south-east to north-west
direction, while in the inner disk (300 pc) follows a north-east to south-west
rotation. The central 300 pc, which hosts a compact starburst region, is filled
with dense and warm gas, contains a dynamical mass of (4-5)x10^9M_sun, a
luminosity of L'_HCN=(3-4)x10^8 K km/s pc^2, and a dust temperature of 55 K. At
the very centre, a compact core with R~50 pc has a luminosity of
L_IR=4x10^11L_sun (30% of the total infrared luminosity), and a dust
temperature of 95 K. The core is expanding at low velocities ~50-100 km/s,
probably affected by the outflowing gas. We detect the blue-shifted component
of the outflow, while the red-shifted counterpart remains undetected in our
data. Its cold and dense phase reaches fast velocities up to ~1000 km/s, while
the warm outflowing gas has more moderate maximum velocities of ~600 km/s. The
outflow is detected as far as 460 pc from the centre in the northern direction,
and has a mass of dense gas <8x10^8M_sun. The difference between the position
angles of the inner disk (~70 degree) and the outflow (~10 degree) indicates
that the outflow is likely powered by the AGN, and not by the starburst.
Regarding the chemistry, we measure an extremely low HCO+/HOC+ ratio of 10+-5
in the inner disk of Mrk273.

this property, which implies that the used algorithms lose their optimality

waste of network resources and/or violating Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In

An Mn metric corresponds to a metric which requires the knowledge of the n

$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is interpreted as a unique signature of a chiral spin liquid
with a Majorana edge mode. A similar quantized thermal Hall effect is expected
in chiral topological superconductors. The unavoidable presence of gapless
acoustic phonons, however, implies that, in contrast to the quantized
electrical conductivity, the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_xy$ is never
exactly quantized in real materials. Here, we investigate how phonons affect
the quantization of the thermal conductivity focusing on the edge theory. As an
example we consider a Kitaev spin liquid gapped by an external magnetic field
coupled to acoustic phonons. The coupling to phonons destroys the ballistic
thermal transport of the edge mode completely, as energy can leak into the
bulk, thus drastically modifying the edge-picture of the thermal Hall effect.
Nevertheless, the thermal Hall conductivity remains approximately quantized and
we argue, that the coupling to phonons to the edge mode is a necessary
condition for the observation of the quantized thermal Hall effect. The
strength of this edge coupling does, however, not affect the conductivity. We
argue that for sufficiently clean systems the leading correction to the
quantized thermal Hall effect, $\Delta \kappa_{xy}/T \sim \text{sign(B)} \,
T^2$, arises from a intrinsic anomalous Hall effect of the acoustic phonons due
to Berry phases imprinted by the chiral (spin) liquid in the bulk. This
correction depends on the sign but not the amplitude of the external magnetic
field.

operators governing the behavior of massless fields on Einstein spacetimes of
Petrov type D, has its origin in a distinguished conformally and GHP covariant
connection on the conformal structure of the spacetime. The conformal class has
a (metric compatible) integrable almost-complex structure under which the
Einstein space becomes a complex (Hermitian) manifold. There is a unique
compatible Weyl connection for the conformal structure, and it leads to the
construction of a conformally covariant GHP formalism and a generalization of
it to weighted spinor/tensor fiber bundles. In particular, `weighted Killing
spinors', previously defined with respect to the Teukolsky connection, are
shown to have their origin in the GHP-Weyl connection, and we show that the
type D principal spinors are actually parallel with respect to it. Furthermore,
we show that the existence of a conformal Killing-Yano tensor can be thought to
be a consequence of the presence of a Kahler metric in the conformal class.
These results provide an interpretation of the persistent hidden symmetries
appearing in black hole perturbations. We also show that the preferred Weyl

kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect signature in the cosmic microwave
background obtained with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) is extremely useful
since this observable is sensitive to the high-redshift diffuse plasma. We
analyse a set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with 4 different
realisations of a Hu & Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, parametrised by the values
of $\overline{f}_{\rm R,0}=(0,-10^{-6},-10^{-5},-10^{-4})$, to compute the
properties of the kSZ effect due to the ionized Universe and how they depend on
$\overline{f}_{\rm R,0}$ and on the redshift of reionization, $z_{\rm re}$. In
the standard General Relativity limit ($\overline{f}_{\rm R,0}$=0) we obtain an
amplitude of the kSZ power spectrum of $\mathcal{D}^{\rm
kSZ}_{3000}=4.1\,$$\mu$K$^2$ ($z_{\rm re}$=8.8), close to the $+1\sigma$ limit
of the $\mathcal{D}^{\rm kSZ}_{3000}=(2.9\pm1.3)\,$$\mu$K$^2$ measurement by
SPT. This corresponds to an upper limit on the kSZ contribute from patchy
reionization of $\mathcal{D}^{\rm kSZ,patchy}_{3000}<0.9\,$$\mu$K$^2$ (95 per
cent confidence level). Modified gravity boosts the kSZ signal by about 3, 12
and 50 per cent for $\overline{f}_{\rm R,0}=(-10^{-6},-10^{-5},-10^{-4})$,
respectively, with almost no dependence on the angular scale. This means that
with modified gravity the limits on patchy reionization shrink significantly:
for $\overline{f}_{\rm R,0}=-10^{-5}$ we obtain $\mathcal{D}^{\rm
kSZ,patchy}_{3000}<0.4\,$$\mu$K$^2$. Finally, we provide an analytical formula
for the scaling of the kSZ power spectrum with $z_{\rm re}$ and
$\overline{f}_{\rm R,0}$ at different multipoles: at $\ell=3000$ we obtain
$\mathcal{D}^{\rm kSZ}_{3000}\propto z_{\rm

heteroscedastic dropout (i.e. dropout with a varying variance) and make the
variance of the dropout a function of privileged information. Intuitively, this
corresponds to using the privileged information to control the uncertainty of
the model output. We perform experiments using CNNs and RNNs for the tasks of
image classification and machine translation. Our method significantly
increases the sample efficiency during learning, resulting in higher accuracy
with a large margin when the number of training examples is limited. We also
theoretically justify the gains in sample efficiency by providing a
generalization error bound decreasing with $O(\frac{1}{n})$, where $n$ is the
number of training examples, in an oracle case.

extensive collection of photometric data of `COLA1', a proposed double peaked
LAE at z=6.6 (Hu et al. 2016). We rule out that COLA1's emission line is an
[OII] doublet at z=1.475 on the basis of i) the asymmetric red line-profile and
flux ratio of the peaks (blue/red=$0.31\pm0.03$) and ii) an unphysical [OII]/Ha
ratio ([OII]/Ha > 22). We show that COLA1's observed B-band flux is explained
by a faint extended foreground LAE, for which we detect Lya and [OIII] at
z=2.142. We thus conclude that COLA1 is a real double-peaked LAE at z=6.593,
the first discovered at z>6, confirming the result from Hu et al. (2016). COLA1
is UV luminous (M$_{1500}=-21.6\pm0.3$), has a high equivalent width
(EW$_{0}$~120 \AA) and very compact Lya emission (r$_{50} = 0.3$ kpc).
Relatively weak inferred Hb+[OIII] line-emission from Spitzer/IRAC indicates an
extremely low metallicity of Z<1/20 Z$_{\odot}$ or reduced strength of nebular
lines due to high escape of ionising photons. The small Lya peak separation of
$220\pm20$ km/s implies a low HI column density and an ionising photon escape
fraction of ~15-30 %, providing the first direct evidence that such galaxies
contribute actively to the reionisation of the Universe at z>6. Based on simple
estimates, we find that COLA1 could have provided just enough photons to
reionise its own ~0.3 pMpc bubble, allowing the blue Lya line to be observed.
However, we also discuss alternative scenarios explaining the detected double
peaked nature of COLA1. Our results show that future high-resolution
observations of statistical samples of double peaked LAEs at z>5 are a
promising probe of the occurrence of ionised regions around galaxies in the
EoR.

particles in the standard model, if these populate our Universe. In addition to
the well-known effect of these light relics in the background cosmology,
usually parametrized through a change in the effective number $N_{\rm eff}$ of
neutrino species, these particles can become nonrelativistic at later times,
affecting the growth of matter fluctuations due to their thermal velocities. An
extensively studied example is that of massive neutrinos, which are known to
produce a suppression in the matter power spectrum due to their free streaming.
Galaxies, as biased traces of matter fluctuations, can therefore provide us
with a wealth of information about both known and unknown degrees of freedom in
the standard model. To harness this information, however, the galaxy bias has
to be determined in the presence of massive relics, which is expected to vary
with scale. Here we present the code RelicFast, which efficiently computes the
scale-dependent bias induced by relics of different masses, spins, and
temperatures, through spherical collapse and the peak-background split. Using
this code, we find that, in general, the bias induced by light relics partially
compensates the suppression of power, and should be accounted for in any search
for relics with galaxy data. In particular, for the case of neutrinos, we find
that both the normal and inverted hierarchies present a percent-level step in
the Lagrangian bias, with a size scaling linearly with the neutrino-mass sum,
in agreement with recent simulations. RelicFast can compute halo bias in under
a second, allowing for this effect to be properly included for different
cosmologies, and light relics, at little computational cost.

of Ross 128b indicate that it lies below the pure rock composition curve,

amounts of each set by the ratio of Fe/Mg. If Ross 128b formed with a sub-solar
Si/Mg ratio, and assuming the planet's composition matches that of the

-- when $A$ is the group algebra of a locally compact group -- the dual of its
Fourier algebra. Beginning with any (completely) contractive (operator)
$A$-module action $Q$ on a space $X$, we introduce the (operator) Fourier space
$({\cal F}_Q(A^*), \| \cdot \|_Q)$ and prove that $({\cal F}_Q(A^*)^*,

lens stars (and any planets they possess) are nearby and may be well studied
and characterised. Aims. We identify a number of potential microlensing events
that will occur before the year 2035.5, 20 years from the Gaia DR2 reference
epoch. Methods. We query Gaia DR2 for potential lenses within 100 pc, extract
parallaxes and proper motions of the lenses and background sources, and
identify potential lensing events. We estimate the lens masses from Priam
effective temperatures, and use these to calculate peak magnifications and the
size of the Einstein radii relative to the lens stars' habitable zones.
Results. We identify 7 future events with a probability > 10% of an alignment
within one Einstein radius. Of particular interest is DR2 5918299904067162240

are typically fainter, hampering characterisation of the lens (if the lens is
faint) or the ability to accurately measure the magnification (if the source is
much fainter than the lens). Of timely interest is DR2 4116504399886241792

element solver of two-phase electrohydrodynamic flow in complex geometries.
Two-phase flow with electrolytes is relevant across a broad range of systems
and scales, from 'lab-on-a-chip' devices for medical diagnostics to enhanced
oil recovery at the reservoir scale. For the strongly coupled multi-physics
problem, we employ a recently developed thermodynamically consistent model
which combines a generalized Nernst-Planck equation for ion transport, the
Poisson equation for electrostatics, the Cahn-Hilliard equation for the phase
field (describing the interface separating the phases), and the Navier-Stokes
equations for fluid flow. As an efficient alternative to solving the coupled
system of partial differential equations in a monolithic manner, we present a
linear, decoupled numerical scheme which sequentially solves the three sets of
equations. The scheme is validated by comparison to limiting cases where
analytical solutions are available, benchmark cases, and by the method of
manufactured solution. The solver operates on unstructured meshes and is
therefore well suited to handle arbitrarily shaped domains and problem set-ups
where, e.g., very different resolutions are required in different parts of the
domain. Bernaise is implemented in Python via the FEniCS framework, which
effectively utilizes MPI and domain decomposition, and should therefore be
suitable for large-scale/high-performance computing. Further, new solvers and
problem set-ups can be specified and added with ease to the Bernaise framework
by experienced Python users.

methods such as stochastic gradient MCMC (SG-MCMC) and Stein variational
gradient descent (SVGD) for big-data analysis. A standard SG-MCMC algorithm
simulates samples from a discrete-time Markov chain to approximate a target
distribution, thus samples could be highly correlated, an undesired property
for SG-MCMC. In contrary, SVGD directly optimizes a set of particles to
approximate a target distribution, and thus is able to obtain good
approximations with relatively much fewer samples. In this paper, we propose a
principle particle-optimization framework based on Wasserstein gradient flows
to unify SG-MCMC and SVGD, and to allow new algorithms to be developed. Our
framework interprets SG-MCMC as particle optimization on the space of
probability measures, revealing a strong connection between SG-MCMC and SVGD.
The key component of our framework is several particle-approximate techniques
to efficiently solve the original partial differential equations on the space
of probability measures. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and deep
neural networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework
for scalable Bayesian sampling.

attacks represent 20\% of total network attacks, making them the most prevalent
type of attack ex-aequo with browser based vulnerabilities. These attacks have
sometimes catastrophic consequences, and understanding their fundamental limits
may play an important role in the risk assessment of password-secured systems,
and in the design of better security protocols. While some solutions exist to
prevent online brute-force attacks that arise from one single IP address,
attacks performed by botnets are more challenging. In this paper, we analyze
these distributed attacks by using a simplified model. Our aim is to understand
the impact of distribution and asynchronization on the overall computational
effort necessary to breach a system. Our result is based on Guesswork, a
measure of the number of queries (guesses) required of an adversary before a
correct sequence, such as a password, is found in an optimal attack. Guesswork
is a direct surrogate for time and computational effort of guessing a sequence
from a set of sequences with associated likelihoods. We model the lack of
synchronization by a worst-case optimization in which the queries made by
multiple adversarial agents are received in the worst possible order for the
adversary, resulting in a min-max formulation. We show that, even without
synchronization, and for sequences of growing length, the asymptotic optimal
performance is achievable by using randomized guesses drawn from an appropriate
distribution. Therefore, randomization is key for distributed asynchronous
attacks. In other words, asynchronous guessers can asymptotically perform
brute-force attacks as efficiently as synchronized guessers.

that a large negative pressure in the framework of classical GR translates into
a large positive pressure once quantum physics is incorporated. In this way, a

its high-temperature Hagedorn phase can appear to have negative pressure and

which utilizes feedback from the system to improve control fidelity. In this
paper, two gradient-based closed-loop quantum optimal control algorithms, the
hybrid quantum-classical approach (HQCA) described in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118,

closed-loop quantum control outperforms the open-loop control in our system.
Furthermore, simulations reveal that HQCA is more robust than the FD method to

We have carried out spectroscopic monitoring of V341 Ara, and we confirm that

show that V341 Ara is remarkably similar to the previously known BZ Cam, a

determination of hit-times and hit-positions of registered photons which
enables the reconstruction of the time and position of the annihilation point

have simulated the production of the positronium in a cylindrical phantom

time-varying covariance matrices of non-stationary time series. Following
concepts from Riemmanian geometry, we investigate three types of covariance
paths obtained by using different quadratic regularizations of system matrices.
The first quadratic form induces the geodesics based on the Bures-Wasserstein
metric from optimal mass transport theory and quantum mechanics. The second
type of quadratic form leads to the geodesics based on the Fisher-Rao metric
from information geometry. In the process, we introduce a fluid-mechanics
interpretation of the Fisher-Rao metric for multivariate Gaussian
distributions. A main contribution of this work is the introduction of the
third type of covariance paths which are steered by linear system matrices with
rotating eigenspace. We provide theoretical results on the existence and
uniqueness of this type of covariance paths. The three types of covariance
paths are compared using two examples with synthetic data and real data based
on functional magnetic resonance imaging, respectively.

features to study the underlying neural activity. Since this could lead to
sub-optimal feature selection and thereby prevent the detection of subtle
patterns in neural activity, data-driven methods have recently gained
popularity for optimizing neuroimaging data analysis pipelines and thereby,
improving our understanding of neural mechanisms. In this context, we developed
a deep convolutional architecture that can identify discriminating patterns in
neuroimaging data and applied it to electroencephalography (EEG) recordings
collected from 25 subjects performing a hand motor task before and after a rest
period or a bout of exercise. The deep network was trained to classify subjects
into exercise and control groups based on differences in their EEG signals.
Subsequently, we developed a novel method termed the cue-combination for Class

spatio-temporal features within definite frequency bands (23--33 Hz) and assess
the effects of exercise on the brain. Additionally, the proposed architecture
allowed the visualization of the differences in the propagation of underlying
neural activity across the cortex between the two groups, for the first time in
our knowledge. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep network
architectures for neuroimaging analysis in different contexts such as, for the
identification of robust brain biomarkers to better characterize and

We single out one particular system by Dinis-Gaspar, which is categorised by
the authors as being part of intuitionistic nonstandard arithmetic. Their
system is indeed inconsistent with the Transfer axiom of Nonstandard Analysis,
and the latter axiom is classical in nature as it implies (higher-order)
comprehension. In this paper, we answer the following questions:
  (Q1) In the spirit of Reverse Mathematics, what is the minimal fragment of
Transfer that is inconsistent with the Dinis-Gaspar system?
  (Q2) What other axioms are inconsistent with the Dinis-Gaspar system?
  Perhaps surprisingly, the answer to the second question shows that the
Dinis-Gaspar system is inconsistent with a number of (non-classical) continuity
theorems which one would -- in our opinion -- categorise as intuitionistic.

suggesting this system also pushes the boundary of what still counts as
'Nonstandard Analysis' or 'internal set theory'.

Existing methods do not adopt a joint approach to capturing synergies between

Inexact Stochastic Mirror Descent (ISMD), to solve nonlinear two-stage

first and second stage decisions. Given a candidate first stage solution and a
realization of the second stage random vector, each iteration of ISMD combines
a stochastic subgradient descent using a prox-mapping with the computation of
approximate (instead of exact for SMD) primal and dual second stage solutions.
We propose two variants of ISMD and show the convergence of these variants to
the optimal value of the stochastic program. We show in particular that under
some assumptions, ISMD has the same convergence rate as SMD. The first variant
of ISMD and its convergence analysis are based on the formulas for inexact cuts
of value functions of convex optimization problems shown recently in [4]. The
second variant of ISMD and the corresponding convergence analysis rely on new
formulas that we derive for inexact cuts of value functions of convex
optimization problems assuming that the dual function of the second stage

random vector, is strongly concave. We show that this assumption of strong
concavity is satisfied for some classes of problems and present the results of

study the dynamics of concentrated bacterial suspensions under simple planar

complex fluids, where the formation of steady shear bands necessarily breaks
the symmetry of unsheared samples. We propose a simple hydrodynamic model based
on the local stress balance and the ergodic sampling of nonequilibrium shear
configurations, which quantitatively describes the observed symmetric

outcome on a subset of items is positive if the subset contains at least one
defective item and no inhibitors, and negative otherwise. We present two
decoding schemes for efficiently identifying the defective items and the
inhibitors in the presence of $e$ erroneous outcomes in time $\mathsf{poly}(d,

complexity significantly improves the state-of-the-art schemes in which the

confirm our theoretical analysis. When the number of items is sufficiently
large, the decoding time in our proposed scheme is smallest in comparison with

that the error signal provided by the discriminator can be unstable and is
sometimes insufficient to train the generator to produce fluent language. In
this paper, we propose a new technique that uses a target domain language model
as the discriminator, providing richer and more stable token-level feedback
during the learning process. We train the generator to minimize the negative
log likelihood (NLL) of generated sentences, evaluated by the language model.
By using a continuous approximation of discrete sampling under the generator,
our model can be trained using back-propagation in an end- to-end fashion.
Moreover, our empirical results show that when using a language model as a
structured discriminator, it is possible to forgo adversarial steps during
training, making the process more stable. We compare our model with previous

microscopic correlations are inconvenient in many physical contexts of wide

ensuing theory yields fluctuations of finite magnitude. Our approach is
demonstrated for a specific biophysical model--the encoding of positional

the dependence of the critical specific impact energy Q_RD* on impact
conditions for a wide range of specific impact energy (Q_R) from disruptive
collisions to erosive collisions, and compare our results with previous
studies. We find collision outcomes of the iSALE simulation agree well with
those of the SPH simulation. Detailed analysis mainly gives three results. (1)
The value of Q_RD* depends on numerical resolution, and is close to convergence
with increasing numerical resolution. The difference in converged value of
Q_RD* between the iSALE code and the SPH code is within 30%. (2) Ejected mass
normalized by total mass (M_ej/M_tot) generally depends on various impact
conditions. However, when Q_R is normalized by Q_RD* that is calculated for
each impact simulation, M_ej/M_tot can be scaled by Q_R/Q_RD*, and is
independent of numerical resolution, impact velocity and target size. (3) This
similarity law for Q_R/Q_RD* is confirmed for a wide range of specific impact
energy. We also derive a semi-analytic formula for Q_RD* based on the
similarity law and the crater scaling law. We find that the semi-analytic
formula for the case with a non-porous object is consistent with numerical
results.

requires gain, but not necessarily any proximity to an exceptional point.
Further, when noise is included, we show that non-reciprocity is a powerful

However, when attacking a deployed machine learning service, one can only
acquire the input-output correspondences of the target model; this is the
so-called black-box attack setting. The major drawback of existing black-box
attacks is the need for excessive model queries, which may give a false sense
of model robustness due to inefficient query designs. To bridge this gap, we
propose a generic framework for query-efficient black-box attacks. Our
framework, AutoZOOM, which is short for Autoencoder-based Zeroth Order

attacks: (i) an adaptive random gradient estimation strategy to balance query
counts and distortion, and (ii) an autoencoder that is either trained offline
with unlabeled data or a bilinear resizing operation for attack acceleration.
Experimental results suggest that, by applying AutoZOOM to a state-of-the-art
black-box attack (ZOO), a significant reduction in model queries can be
achieved without sacrificing the attack success rate and the visual quality of
the resulting adversarial examples. In particular, when compared to the
standard ZOO method, AutoZOOM can consistently reduce the mean query counts in
finding successful adversarial examples (or reaching the same distortion level)
by at least 93% on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, leading to novel
insights on adversarial robustness.

Higher order spectra (HOS) have been used in unsupervised and supervised

Gaussian noise, to characterize nonlinearities in time series data, and so on .
  Any algorithm for computing the $k$th order spectra of a time series of
length $n$ needs $\Omega(n^{k-1})$ time since the output size will be
$\Omega(n^{k-1})$ as well. Given that we live in an era of big data, $n$ could
be very large. In this case, sequential algorithms might take unacceptable
amounts of time. Thus it is essential to develop parallel algorithms. There is
also room for improving existing sequential algorithms. In addition, parallel
algorithms in the literature are nongeneric. In this paper we offer generic
sequential algorithms for computing higher order spectra that are
asymptotically faster than any published algorithm for HOS. Further, we offer
memory efficient algorithms. We also present optimal parallel implementations
of these algorithms on parallel computing models such as the PRAM and the mesh.

alternative that is more effective in many situations. We propose a new score,
called the trust score, which measures the agreement between the classifier and
a modified nearest-neighbor classifier on the testing example. We show
empirically that high (low) trust scores produce surprisingly high precision at
identifying correctly (incorrectly) classified examples, consistently
outperforming the classifier's confidence score as well as many other
baselines. Further, under some mild distributional assumptions, we show that if
the trust score for an example is high (low), the classifier will likely agree

non-asymptotic rates of statistical consistency under various nonparametric

performance analysis, two different datasets for two applications (classifying
handwritten digits from the MNIST database and classifying brain MRI images
into one of the four stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD)) are used. For both
applications, an activation function is randomly selected for each layer of a

interferometry that allows for the first time mapping of fields with deep

near the superoscillatory hotspot has many features similar to those found near

nanoscale phase singularities (~ {\lambda}/50 in size) and zones where the
phase of the wave changes more than tenfold faster than in a standing wave.

dependence of the primordial spectrum. When primordial power spectrum is
enhanced/suppressed on small scales, the structure formation proceeds
faster/slower and changes the abundance of small size halos, which affects the
sources of Lyman $\alpha$ radiation at high redshifts to alter the position of
the absorption line. Recent observation of EDGES detected the 21cm absorption
line at $z=17.2$ and this result also indicates that the brightness temperature
is consistent with zero for $z \lesssim 14$ and $z \gtrsim 22$, which can
exclude a scenario giving the absorption line at such redshifts. We argue that
the bound on the running parameters can be obtained by requiring that the
absorption line should not exceed observational bounds at such redshift ranges

Planck may be disfavored for some values of astrophysical parameters.

quantum measurements with resource limitations, allowing the global state of
many qubits to be constructed from only measuring a few. We give a
proof-of-principle investigation demonstrating successful tomographic
reconstruction of an arbitrary initial quantum state for three different
situations: single qubit, remote qubit, and two interacting qubits. The
tomographic reconstruction utilizes only a continuous weak probe of a single
qubit observable, a fixed coupling Hamiltonian, together with single-qubit
controls. In the single qubit case, a combination of the continuous measurement
of an observable and a Rabi oscillation is sufficient to find all three unknown
qubit state components. For two interacting qubits, where only one observable
of the first qubit is measured, the control Hamiltonian can be implemented to
transfer all quantum information to the measured observable, via the
qubit-qubit interaction and Rabi oscillation controls applied locally on each
qubit. We discuss different sets of controls by analyzing the unitary dynamics
and the Fisher information matrix of the estimation in the limit of weak
measurement, and simulate tomographic results numerically. As a result, we
obtained reconstructed state fidelities in excess of 0.98 with a few thousand

an exogenous driver which affects the prey growth rate. Mathematically, this
exogenous driver is a function of time, the climate function, that describes
how favorable is the climate, on a scale from $-1$ to $+1$. Climate change has
a number of effects; in this work, we focus on changes in climate variability,
in particular, a decrease in the switching rate between good years and bad.
With regard to the predator-prey populations, we focus on the conditions that
lead to extinction. We developed a high performance software tool to allow the
systematic exploration of a wide range of climate scenarios at a high level of
detail. Our results show that the predator-prey system is sensitive to the
rapid drop in growth rate that accompanies a switch from good growth years to
bad growth years. The amplitude of this negative variation as well as its
duration are key factors, but more importantly, it is the moment when this
negative change occurs during the predator-prey cycle that is critical for the

mechanism is dominated by both surface driven WAL (weak anti localization) and
the bulk WL states. The value of HLN equation coefficient signifying the type
of localization (WL, WAL or both WL and WAL) falls within the range of -0.5 to
-1.5. In our case, the low field (0.25Tesla) fitting of studied crystal
exhibited value close to -0.86 for studied temperatures of up to 50K,
indicating both WAL and WL contributions. The phase coherence length is found
to decrease from 98.266 to 40.314nm with increasing temperature. Summarily, the

might be biased and influenced by different personal, social and/or
environmental variables. Pedestrians are ideal subjects for the study of
decision-making, due to the inter-individual variation in risk taking. Many
studies have attempted to understand which environmental factors (light colour,
waiting times, etc.) influence the number of times pedestrians broke the rules
at road-crossings, very few focused on the decision-making process of
pedestrians according to the different conditions of these variables, that is
to say their perception and interpretation of the information they receive.
This study used survival analyses to highlight the decision-making process of
pedestrians crossing the road at signalized crossings in France and in Japan.
For both light colours, we decided to carry out separate analyses for the first
pedestrian to step off the kerb and other individuals following him/her, as the
decisions underlying the departure of a first individual and those of the
followers are different, and the departure of the first pedestrians strongly
influences the decisions of other individuals. We showed that the probability
to cross the road follows three different processes: one at the red light, one
just before the pedestrian light turns green, and one after the light has
turned green. Globally, the decision of the first pedestrian to cross, whether
he or she does so at the green or at the red light, is influenced by their
country of residence. We observed a lower threshold for Japanese pedestrians
because they tend to follow their private or personal information. We identify
the use of cognitive processes such as risk sensitivity and temporal
discounting, and propose new concepts based on the results of this study to
decrease the incidence of rule-breaking by pedestrians.

Followership behaviour is particularly interesting in the context of

to identify the cognitive mechanisms underlying decision-making by pedestrians
who follow another person across the road at the green or at the red light in
two different countries (France and Japan). We used agent-based modelling to
simulate the road-crossing behaviours of pedestrians. This study showed that
modelling is a reliable means to test different hypotheses and find the exact
processes underlying decision-making when crossing the road. We found that two
processes suffice to simulate pedestrian behaviours. Importantly, the study
revealed differences between the two nationalities and between sexes in the
decision to follow and cross at the green and at the red light. Japanese
pedestrians are particularly attentive to the number of already departed
pedestrians and the number of waiting pedestrians at the red light, whilst
their French counterparts only consider the number of pedestrians that have
already stepped off the kerb, thus showing the strong conformism of Japanese
people. Finally, the simulations are revealed to be similar to observations,
not only for the departure latencies but also for the number of crossing
pedestrians and the rates of illegal crossings. The conclusion suggests new
solutions for safety in transportation research.

too has the number of malicious applications. Due to the potential for data
theft mobile phone users face, the detection of malware on Android devices has
become an increasingly important issue in cyber security. Traditional methods
like signature-based routines are unable to protect users from the
ever-increasing sophistication and rapid behavior changes in new types of
Android malware. Therefore, a great deal of effort has been made recently to
use machine learning models and methods to characterize and generalize the
malicious behavior patterns of mobile apps for malware detection.
  In this paper, we propose a novel and highly reliable classifier for Android
Malware detection based on a Factorization Machine architecture and the
extraction of Android app features from manifest files and source code. Our
results indicate that the numerical feature representation of an app typically
results in a long and highly sparse vector and that the interactions among
different features are critical to revealing malicious behavior patterns. After
performing an extensive performance evaluation, our proposed method achieved a
test result of 100.00% precision score on the DREBIN dataset and 99.22%
precision score with only 1.10% false positive rate on the AMD dataset. These
metrics match the performance of state-of-the-art machine-learning-based
Android malware detection methods and several commercial antivirus engines with
the benefit of training up to 50 times faster.

mortality securitization, \`a la F\""ollmer-Sondermann for a large class of
equity-linked mortality contracts when no model for the death time is
specified. This framework includes the situation where the correlation between
the market model and the time of death is arbitrary general, and hence leads to
the case of a market model where there are two levels of information. The
public information which is generated by the financial assets, and a larger
flow of information that contains additional knowledge about a death time of an
insured. By enlarging the filtration, the death uncertainty and its entailed
risk are fully considered without any mathematical restriction.
  Our key tool lies in our optional martingale representation that states that
any martingale in the large filtration stopped at the death time can be
decomposed into precise orthogonal local martingales. This allows us to derive
the dynamics of the value processes of the mortality/longevity securities used
for the securitization, and to decompose any mortality/longevity liability into
the sum of orthogonal risks by means of a risk basis. The first main
contribution of this paper resides in quantifying, as explicit as possible, the
effect of mortality uncertainty on the risk-minimizing strategy by determining
the optimal strategy in the enlarged filtration in terms of strategies in the
smaller filtration. Our second main contribution consists of finding
risk-minimizing strategies with insurance securitization by investing in stocks
and one (or more) mortality/longevity derivatives such as longevity bonds. This
generalizes the existing literature on risk-minimization using mortality
securitization in many directions.

low-cost CubeSat solution for near-UV/optical/near-IR spectroscopy that enables
this type of observations. CUBESPEC is a generic spectrograph that can be
configured with minimal hardware changes to deliver both low resolution (R=100)
with very large spectral coverage (200-1000nm), as well as high resolution
(R=30,000) over a selected wavelength range. It is built around an off-axis
Cassegrain telescope and a slit spectrograph with configurable dispersion
elements. CUBESPEC will use a compact attitude determination and control system
for coarse pointing of the entire spacecraft, supplemented with a fine-guidance
system using a fast steering mirror to center the source on the spectrograph
slit and to cancel out satellite jitter. An extremely compact optical design

theoretical neuroscience. Since a cost function by itself does not predict how
the brain finds its minima, additional assumptions about the optimization
method need to be made to predict the dynamics of physiological quantities. In
this context, steepest descent (also called gradient descent) is often
suggested as an algorithmic principle of optimization potentially implemented
by the brain. In practice, researchers often consider the vector of partial
derivatives as the gradient. However, the definition of the gradient and the
notion of a steepest direction depend on the choice of a metric. Since the
choice of the metric involves a large number of degrees of freedom, the
predictive power of models that are based on gradient descent must be called
into question, unless there are strong constraints on the choice of the metric.
Here we provide a didactic review of the mathematics of gradient descent,
illustrate common pitfalls of using gradient descent as a principle of brain
function with examples from the literature and propose ways forward to
constrain the metric.

to 1.0 (square cylinder). The results show that the permeability of the bodies
has a strong effect in modifying the characteristics of the wakes and of the
associated flow instabilities, while the porosity weakly affects the resulting
flow patterns. In particular, the fluid flows through the porous bodies and,
thus, as the permeability is progressively increased, the recirculation
regions, initially attached to the rear part of the bodies, at first detach
from the body and, eventually, disappear even in the near wakes. Global
stability analyses lead to the identification of critical values of the
permeability above which any linear instability is prevented. Moreover, a
different scaling of the non-dimensional permeability allows to identify a
general threshold for all the configurations here studied that ensures the
suppression of vortex shedding, at least in the considered parameter space.

polarization ($\sim 1$\%) in the late phase. This polarization feature is
generally believed to be due to an inner aspherical core revealed in the late
phase, while this polarization feature can also be contributed by the effect of
polarized-scattered echoes by circumstellar (CS) dust around the SN. In this
paper, we propose a unique method to distinguish polarization from the SN
ejecta and from the light echo. We quantitatively examine wavelength dependence
of the polarization created by the scattered echoes for various geometries and
amounts of CS dust. It is found that the polarization in the $U$-band has
characteristic features, i.e., the polarization emerges at an earlier phase
with higher polarization degree than that in longer wavelengths. These are due
to the rapid evolution of the $U$-band light curve as well as higher optical
depth of dust in shorter wavelengths. Except for the $U$ band, the polarization
increases after the plateau phase, and the polarization degree is generally
higher for shorter wavelengths. These polarimetric features can be easily
distinguished from the polarization expected from an aspherical core, which
predicts almost no wavelength dependence. Moreover, we show that multi-band
polarimetric observations for SNe IIP can constrain a parameter space in the CS
dust mass and distance from the SNe. We thus encourage multi-band polarimetric
observations for SNe IIP.

critical temperature of the heat bath beyond which it is not possible to create
magic in the reduced qubit attached to the heat bath. Below the critical
temperature, the strength of interaction between the qubits must lie within a
certain region for creation of magic. We further note that by increasing the
strength of coupling of the second qubit to the spin bath, typified by the
reset probability, keeping the coupling strength of the first qubit to the heat
bath fixed, it is possible to increase the critical temperature of the heat

whether nematicity is driven by spin or orbital fluctuations remains unsettled.

most challenging problems in theoretical many-body physics. While the evolution
is in general intractable in all its details, relevant observables can become
insensitive to microscopic system parameters and initial conditions. This is
the basis of the phenomenon of universality. Far from equilibrium, universality
is identified through the scaling of the spatiotemporal evolution of the
system, captured by universal exponents and functions. Theoretically, this has
been studied in examples as different as the reheating process in inflationary
universe cosmology, the dynamics of nuclear collision experiments described by
quantum chromodynamics, or the post-quench dynamics in dilute quantum gases in
non-relativistic quantum field theory. Here we observe the emergence of
universal dynamics by evaluating spatially resolved spin correlations in a
quasi one-dimensional spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. For long evolution times
we extract the scaling properties from the spatial correlations of the spin
excitations. From this we find the dynamics to be governed by transport of an
emergent conserved quantity towards low momentum scales. Our results establish
an important class of non-stationary systems whose dynamics is encoded in time
independent scaling exponents and functions signaling the existence of
non-thermal fixed points. We confirm that the non-thermal scaling phenomenon
involves no fine-tuning, by preparing different initial conditions and
observing the same scaling behaviour. Our analog quantum simulation approach
provides the basis to reveal the underlying mechanisms and characteristics of
non-thermal universality classes. One may use this universality to learn, from
experiments with ultra-cold gases, about fundamental aspects of dynamics
studied in cosmology and quantum chromodynamics.

states in a time-reversal-invariant superconductor with an extended $s$-wave
pairing and strong spin-orbit coupling. By simply tuning the chemical potential
we access three distinct phases: topologically trivial $s$-wave, topologically
non-trivial $s_\pm$-wave, and nodal superconducting phase. For a single
potential impurity we find subgap impurity bound states in the topological
phase, but notably no subgap states in the trivial phase. These subgap impurity
states have always finite energies for any strength of the potential scattering
and subsequently, the superconducting gap in the topological $s_\pm$-wave phase
survives but is attenuated in the presence of finite disorder. By creating
islands of potential impurities we smoothly connect the single impurity results
to topological edge states of impurity island. On the other hand, magnetic
impurities lead to the formation of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in both the trivial
and topological phases, which even reach zero energy at certain scattering
strengths. We thus propose that potential impurities can be a very valuable
tool to detect time-reversal-invariant topological superconductivity.

to the ordinary chiral Lagrangian $L_{EC L}$, yielding in the lowest order

modern graph processing systems towards multi-query analysis, i.e., processing
multiple graph queries in parallel on a shared graph. These applications
generate a dynamic number of localized queries around query hotspots such as
popular urban areas. However, existing graph processing systems are not yet
tailored towards these properties: The employed methods for graph partitioning
and synchronization management disregard query locality and dynamism which
leads to high query latency. To this end, we propose the system Q-Graph for
multi-query graph analysis that considers query locality on three levels. (i)
The query-aware graph partitioning algorithm Q-cut maximizes query locality to
reduce communication overhead. (ii) The method for synchronization management,
called hybrid barrier synchronization, allows for full exploitation of local
queries spanning only a subset of partitions. (iii) Both methods adapt at
runtime to changing query workloads in order to maintain and exploit locality.
Our experiments show that Q-cut reduces average query latency by up to 57
percent compared to static query-agnostic partitioning algorithms.

structures when conditional independence and goodness of fit are both assessed
using entropy and the topological ordering of the network is known (Cowell,
2001).
  In this paper, we investigate how these three classes of algorithms perform
outside the assumptions above in terms of speed and accuracy of network
reconstruction for both discrete and Gaussian Bayesian networks. We approach
this question by recognising that structure learning is defined by the
combination of a statistical criterion and an algorithm that determines how the
criterion is applied to the data. Removing the confounding effect of different
choices for the statistical criterion, we find using both simulated and
real-world complex data that constraint-based algorithms are often less
accurate than score-based algorithms, but are seldom faster (even at large
sample sizes); and that hybrid algorithms are neither faster nor more accurate
than constraint-based algorithms. This suggests that commonly held beliefs on
structure learning in the literature are strongly influenced by the choice of
particular statistical criteria rather than just by the properties of the
algorithms themselves.

the presence of fat-tailed symmetric and asymmetric probability distributions

symmetric and asymmetric broad probability distributions of synthetic data are
examined starting from Levy regime up to those with finite variance. We use
nonextensive Tsallis statistics to construct all considered data in order to
have good analytical description of frequencies of fluctuations in the whole
range of their magnitude and simultaneously the full control over exponent of
power-law decay for tails of probability distribution. The semi-analytical
compact formulas are then provided to express the level of spurious
multifractality generated by the presence of fat tails in terms of Tsallis
parameter $\tilde{q}$ and the scaling exponent $\beta$ of the asymptotic decay
of cumulated probability density function (CDF).The results are presented in
Hurst and H\""{o}lder languages - more often used in study of multifractal
phenomena. According to the provided semi-analytical relations, it is argued
how one can make a clear quantitative distinction for any real data between
true multifractality caused by the presence of nonlinear correlations, spurious
multifractality generated by fat-tailed shape of distributions - eventually
with their asymmetry, and the correction due to linear autocorrelations in
analyzed time series of finite length. In particular, the spurious multifractal
effect of fat tails is found basic for proper quantitative estimation of all
spurious multifractal effects. Examples from stock market data are presented to
support these findings.

transmission electron microscopy combined with a novel scanning precession

of techniques enabled evaluation of the atomic arrangement within individual
precipitates, as well as an improved estimate of precipitate phase fractions at
each ageing condition, through analysis of a statistically significant number
of precipitates. Based on the obtained results, the total amount of solute
atoms locked inside precipitates could be approximated. It was shown that even
with a Cu content close to impurity levels, the Al-Mg-Si system precipitation
was significantly affected with overageing. The principal change was due to a
gradually increasing phase fraction of the Cu-containing Q'-phase, which
eventually was seen to dominate the precipitate structures. The structural
overtake could be explained based on a continuous formation of the thermally
stable Q'-phase, with Cu atomic columns incorporating less Cu than what could

contain exploitable software bugs despite the ongoing efforts. The applications
today often involve processing of sensitive information. However, the lack of
privilege separation within the user space leaves sensitive application secret
such as cryptographic keys just as unprotected as a ""hello world"" string.
Cutting-edge hardware-supported security features are being introduced.
However, the features are often vendor-specific or lack compatibility with
older generations of the processors. The situation leaves developers with no
portable solution to incorporate protection for the sensitive application
component.
  We propose LOTRx86, a fundamental and portable approach for user space
privilege separation. Our approach creates a more privileged user execution
layer called PrivUser through harnessing the underused intermediate privilege
levels on the x86 architecture. The PrivUser memory space, a set of pages
within process address space that are inaccessible to user mode, is a safe
place for application secrets and routines that access them. We implement the
LOTRx86 ABI that exports the privilege-based, accessing the protected
application secret only requires a change in the privilege, eliminating the
need for costly remote procedure calls or change in address space.
  We evaluated our platform by developing a proof-of-concept LOTRx86-enabled
web server that employs our architecture to securely access its private key

differential equations (PDEs) of the convection-diffusion type are used in all
fields of science and engineering. To achieve optimal performance, solvers have
to exhibit high arithmetic intensity and need to exploit every form of
parallelism available in modern manycore CPUs. The computationally most
expensive components of the solver are the repeated applications of the linear
operator and the preconditioner. For discretisations based on higher-order
Discontinuous Galerkin methods, sum-factorisation results in a dramatic
reduction of the computational complexity of the operator application while, at
the same time, the matrix-free implementation can run at a significant fraction
of the theoretical peak floating point performance. Multigrid methods for high
order methods often rely on block-smoothers to reduce high-frequency error
components within one grid cell. Traditionally, this requires the assembly and
expensive dense matrix solve in each grid cell, which counteracts any
improvements achieved in the fast matrix-free operator application. To overcome
this issue, we present a new matrix-free implementation of block-smoothers.
Inverting the block matrices iteratively avoids storage and factorisation of
the matrix and makes it is possible to harness the full power of the CPU. We
implemented a hybrid multigrid algorithm with matrix-free block-smoothers in
the high order DG space combined with a low order coarse grid correction using
algebraic multigrid where only low order components are explicitly assembled.
The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by solving a set of
representative elliptic PDEs of increasing complexity, including a convection
dominated problem and the stationary SPE10 benchmark.

reconstruction under a priori information, i.e., column or row subspace
information, has not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we present
designs of affine maps and reconstruction algorithms that fully exploit the
low-rank matrix subspace information. Compared to the randomly generated affine
map, the proposed affine map design permits an enhanced reconstruction. In
addition, we derive an optimal representation of low-rank matrices, which is
exploited to optimize the rank and subspace of the estimate by adapting them to
the noise level in order to achieve the minimum mean square error (MSE).
Moreover, in the case when the subspace information is not a priori available,
we propose a two-step algorithm, where, in the first step, it estimates the
column subspace of a low-rank matrix, and in the second step, it exploits the
estimated information to complete the reconstruction. The simulation results
show that the proposed algorithm achieves robust performance with much lower

found both in the density profile and magnetoresistivity. We discuss the impact
of electron density, Landau level broadening and Rashba spin-orbit constant on
the appearance of the beatings in low magnetic fields and find that at low
electron concentrations and not very strong spin-orbit interactions the
beatings smooth out. On the other hand, as the magnetic field increases, the
Zeeman term becomes the dominant splitting mechanism leading to the spin-split
peaks in SdH oscillations. We also show that the observation of the beatings in
low magnetic fields needs a system with rather higher carrier concentration so
that the beatings persist up to sufficiently large fields where the
oscillations are not smoothed out by Landau level broadening. The quantum Hall
plateaus are evaluated and we show the Chern number with both even and odd

viscosity anomaly has received less attention. Here we simulate viscosity and
self-diffusion coefficient of the TIP4P/2005 water model over a broad
temperature and pressure range. We reproduce the experimental behavior, and
find additional anomalies at negative pressure. The anomalous effect of
pressure on dynamic properties becomes more pronounced upon cooling, reaching
two orders of magnitude for viscosity at 220 K. We analyze our results with a
dynamic extension of a thermodynamic two-state model, an approach which has
proved successful in describing experimental data. Water is regarded as a
mixture of interconverting species with contrasting dynamic behaviors, one
being strong (Arrhenius), and the other fragile (non-Arrhenius). The dynamic
parameters of the two-state models are remarkably close between experiment and
simulations. The larger pressure range accessible to simulations suggests a
modification of the dynamic two-state model, which in turn also improves the
agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, our simulations demonstrate the
decoupling between viscosity $\eta$ and self-diffusion coefficient $D$ as a
function of temperature $T$. The Stokes-Einstein relation, which predicts a
constant $D \eta/T$, is violated when $T$ is lowered, in connection with the
Widom line defined by an equal fraction of the two interconverting species.
These results provide a unifying picture of thermodynamics and dynamics in
water, and call for experiments at negative pressure.

can be taken into account when building synthetic color-magnitude diagrams
(CMDs) that are to be compared to observed CMDs. We have computed atmosphere
models and synthetic spectra for two stars, Pollux and Procyon, that have
stellar parameters typical of turn-off and bottom red giant branch stars in
globular clusters. We then varied the effective temperature, surface gravity,
microturbulence, the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen abundances, and [Fe/H]. We
quantified the effect on synthetic photometry in the following filters: Johnson
UBVRI and HST F275W, F336W, F410M, F438W, F555W, F606W, and F814W. We estimated
the effects of extinction, atmospheric correction, and of the Vega reference
spectrum on the resulting photometry. We tested the ability of our models to
reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution and observed photometry of
the two stars. We show that variations are generally stronger in blue filters.
Dispersions on synthetic colors due to uncertainties on stellar parameters vary
between less than 0.01 and to 0.04 magnitude, depending on the choice of
filters. Uncertainties on the zero points, the extinction law, or the
atmospheric correction affect the resulting colors at a level of a few 0.01
magnitudes in a systematic way. The models reproduce the flux-calibrated
spectral energy distribution of both stars well. Comparison between synthetic
and observed UBVRI photometry shows a variable degree of (dis)agreement. The
observed differences likely indicate that different calibration processes are

an in-place sensor network (or sensor array), a reference is arbitrarily chosen
with or without prior information on sensor performance. However, an arbitrary
selection of a reference could prove fatal, if an erroneous sensor is
inadvertently chosen. To avert single point of dependence, and to improve
estimator performance, we propose unbiased reference-free algorithms. Although,
our focus is on reference-free solutions, the proposed framework, allows the
incorporation of additional references, if available. We show with the help of
simulations that the proposed solutions achieve the derived statistical lower
bounds asymptotically. In addition, the proposed algorithms show improvements
on real-life datasets, as compared to prevalent algorithms.

barrier and a smaller critical nucleus size. Furthermore, the liquid domain
does not grow indefinitely on a sphere. Saturation of the liquid density in the
grand canonical ensemble and the depletion of the gas phase in the canonical
ensemble lead to a minimum in the free energy profile, with a sharp increase in
free energy for additional growth beyond this minimum.

(SPL) lead to well-formed and acceptable products is challenging since it is
most of the time impractical to enumerate and test all individual products of
an SPL. Machine learning classifiers have been recently used to predict the
acceptability of products associated with unseen configurations. For some
configurations, a tiny change in their feature values can make them pass from
acceptable to non-acceptable regarding users' requirements and vice-versa. In
this paper, we introduce the idea of leveraging these specific configurations
and their positions in the feature space to improve the classifier and
therefore the engineering of an SPL. Starting from a variability model, we
propose to use Adversarial Machine Learning techniques to create new,
adversarial configurations out of already known configurations by modifying
their feature values. Using an industrial video generator we show how
adversarial configurations can improve not only the classifier, but also the
variability model, the variability implementation, and the testing oracle.

of computable incoherence measure of the measurement matrix, $q$-ratio
constrained minimal singular values (CMSV) was proposed in Zhou and Yu
\cite{zhou2018sparse} to derive the performance bounds for sparse recovery. In
this paper, we study the geometrical property of the $q$-ratio CMSV, based on
which we establish new sufficient conditions for signal recovery involving both
sparsity defect and measurement error. The $\ell_1$-truncated set $q$-width of
the measurement matrix is developed as the geometrical characterization of
$q$-ratio CMSV. In addition, we show that the $q$-ratio CMSVs of a class of
structured random matrices are bounded away from zero with high probability as
long as the number of measurements is large enough, therefore satisfy those
established sufficient conditions. Overall, our results generalize the results
in Zhang and Cheng \cite{zc} from $q=2$ to any $q\in(1,\infty]$ and complement
the arguments of $q$-ratio CMSV from a geometrical view.

replacing the scalar electromagnetic description by a vector theory, with the

hand, incorporating polarization into interferometry is known to be equivalent
to scalar theory if the number of channels is doubled. We show that passive
multiphoton $m$ channel interferometry described by SU($m$) transformations is
replaced by SU($2m$) interferometry if polarization is included and thus that
the multiphoton coincidence landscape, whose domain corresponds to various
relative delays between photon arrival times, is fully explained by the
now-standard approach of using immanants to compute coincidence sampling
probabilities. Consequently, we show that the triad phase is manifested simply
as SU(6) interferometry with three input photons, with one photon in each of
three different input ports. Our analysis incorporates passive polarization
multichannel interferometry into the existing scalar-field approach to
computing multiphoton coincidence probabilities in interferometry and
demystifies the triad phase.

clusters. There appears to be slight dependence of the IMR(t) on the CO surface
brightness, which could support the idea that dense molecular environments are
more likely to form bound clusters. However, the IMR(t) appears to have a
strong dependence on extinction, which likely traces the evolutionary state of
clusters.

which admites a description in terms of the canonical Poisson structure, i.e.,

has a number of important applications like quantization of the original
Poisson manifold. In the present paper we extend the above idea to the case of
quasi-Poisson structures which should not necessarily satisfy the Jacobi
identity. For any given quasi-Poisson structure $\Theta$ we provide a recursive
procedure of the construction of a symplectic manifold, as well as the
corresponding expression in the Darboux coordinates, which we look in form of
the generalized Bopp shift. Our construction is illustrated on the exemples of
the constant $R$-flux algebra, quasi-Poisson structure isomorphic to the

$R$-flux backgrounds. In all cases we derive explicit formulae for the
symplectic realization and the generalized Bopp shift. We also discuss possible

  to Improve Cache Reuse -- Extended Results and Technical Report",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In BUNDLE: Real-Time Multi-Threaded Scheduling to Reduce Cache Contention,
Tessler and Fisher propose a scheduling mechanism and combined worst-case
execution time calculation method that treats the instruction cache as a
beneficial resource shared between threads. Object analysis produces a
worst-case execution time bound and separates code segments into regions.
Threads are dynamically placed in bundles as- sociated with regions at run time
by the BUNDLE scheduling algorithm where they benefit from shared cache values.
  In the evaluation of the previous work, tasks were created with a
predetermined worst-case execution time path through the control flow graph.
Apriori knowledge of the worst-case path is an impractical restriction on any
analysis. At the time, the only other solution available was an all-paths
search of the graph, which is an equally impractical approach due to its
complexity.
  The primary focus of this work is to build upon BUNDLE, expanding its
applicability beyond a proof of concept. We present a complete a worst-case
execution time calculation method that includes thread level context switch
costs, operating on real programs, with representative architecture parameters,
and compare our results to those produced by Heptane's state of the art method.
To these ends, we propose a modification to the BUNDLE scheduling algorithm
called BUNDLEP. Bundles are assigned priorities that enforce an ordered flow of
threads through the control flow graph -- avoiding the need for multiple
all-paths searches through the graph. In many cases, our evaluation shows a
run-time and analytical benefit for BUNLDEP compared to serialized thread
execution and state of the art WCET analysis.

possibility, if not the necessity, of bringing cognitive aspects into the play,

this article, we outline the path that led us to support the hypothesis that
our physical reality is fundamentally conceptual-like and cognitivistic-like.
However, contrary to the 'abstract ego hypothesis' introduced by John von
Neumann and further explored, in more recent times, by Henry Stapp, our
approach does not rely on the measurement problem as expressing a possible 'gap
in physical causation', which would point to a reality lying beyond the
mind-matter distinction. On the contrary, in our approach the measurement
problem is considered to be essentially solved, at least for what concerns the
origin of quantum probabilities, which we have reasons to believe they would be
epistemic. Our conclusion that conceptuality and cognition would be an integral
part of all physical processes comes instead from the observation of the
striking similarities between the non-spatial behavior of the quantum
micro-physical entities and that of the human concepts. This gave birth to a
new interpretation of quantum mechanics, called the 'conceptualistic
interpretation', currently under investigation within our group in Brussels.

fed again into the input. The same formal structure is encountered in the
problem of time travel in a neighborhood of a closed timelike curve (CTC). We
know how to describe quantum optics of ring resonators, and the resulting
description agrees with experiment. We can apply the same formal strategy to
any looped quantum evolution, in particular to the time travel. The argument is
in its essence a topological one and thus does not refer to any concrete
geometry. It is shown that the resulting paradigm automatically removes logical
inconsistencies associated with chronology protection, provided all
input-output relations are given by unitary maps. Examples of elementary loops
and a two-loop time machine illustrate the construction. In order to apply the
formalism to quantum computation one has to describe multi-qubit systems
interacting via CTC-based quantum gates. This is achieved by second
quantization of loops. An example of a multiparticle system, with oscillators
interacting via a time machine, is explicitly calculated. However, the
resulting treatment of CTCs is not equivalent to the one proposed by Deutsch in
his classic paper.

the range from 100 Hz to 10 MHz and at temperature range of 140 oC to 300 oC
were carried out on the mixed alkali vanadate glass samples having lithium and
rubidium as alkali elements. The analysis of the data is done using
Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) equation which describes the relaxation
behavior of the mobile species. We have used the Bergman equation (R. Bergman,
J. Apl. Phys. 88 (2000) 1356.) for fitting the imaginary part of the electrical
modulus. The stretching parameter beta derived from this fit shows a nonlinear
variation with respect to alkali content which is attributed to mixed alkali
effect. The variations of beta with respect to alkali element concentration is
analyzed on the basis of alkali ion distance and molar volume. It is found that
the coupling between the mobile ions is better at 50 mol percentage of the
alkali mixture when compared to single alkali concentrations. It is observed
that coupling between the ions are weak in case of all Rubidium glass than all
Lithium or Lithium-Rubidium mixture, even though the alkali concentration is on
the higher (30 mol percentage) side. The contributions from fast and slow types
of relaxation mechanisms were determined. It again shows that at low
concentrations of Rubidium ions, there exists a good coupling between alkali
ions and contribute to a macroscopic relaxation time responsible for the
stretching, whereas at high concentrations of Rubidium ions the relaxing sites
decouple and relax with a microscopic relaxation time. A scaling of modulus
spectra with respect to frequency shows that stretching parameter beta is
slightly dependent on temperature.

hardware-efficient pruning scheme to reduce the computation cost for
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Channel gating identifies regions in the
features that contribute less to the classification result, and skips the
computation on a subset of the input channels for these ineffective regions.
Unlike static network pruning, channel gating optimizes CNN inference at
run-time by exploiting input-specific characteristics, which allows
substantially reducing the compute cost with almost no accuracy loss. We
experimentally show that applying channel gating in state-of-the-art networks
achieves 2.7-8.0$\times$ reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) and
2.0-4.4$\times$ reduction in off-chip memory accesses with a minimal accuracy
loss on CIFAR-10. Combining our method with knowledge distillation reduces the
compute cost of ResNet-18 by 2.6$\times$ without accuracy drop on ImageNet. We
further demonstrate that channel gating can be realized in hardware
efficiently. Our approach exhibits sparsity patterns that are well-suited to
dense systolic arrays with minimal additional hardware. We have designed an
accelerator for channel gating networks, which can be implemented using either
FPGAs or ASICs. Running a quantized ResNet-18 model for ImageNet, our
accelerator achieves an encouraging speedup of 2.4$\times$ on average, with a
theoretical FLOP reduction of 2.8$\times$.

some peculiar SNeIa, which are predicted to be originating from white dwarfs of
mass much less than the Chandrasekhar mass limit or much higher than it.
Although the unification of these two sub-classes of SNeIa was attempted
earlier by our group, in this work, we, for the first time, explain this
phenomenon in terms of just one property of the white dwarf which is its
central density. Thereby we do not vary the fundamental parameters of the
underlying gravity model in the contrary to the earlier attempt. We effectively
consider higher order corrections to the Starobinsky-$f(R)$ gravity model to
reveal the unification. We show that the limiting mass of a white dwarf is
$\sim M_\odot$ for central density $\rho_c \sim 1.4\times10^8$ g/cc, while it
is $\sim 2.8M_\odot$ for $\rho_c \sim1.6\times 10^{10}$ g/cc under the same
model parameters. We further confirm that these models are viable with respect
to the solar system test. This perhaps enlightens very strongly the long

signed particle formulation of quantum mechanics to rapidly and reliably
compute the Wigner kernel of any provided potential. This new technique has
introduced two important advantages over the more standard finite
difference/element methods: 1) it reduces the amount of memory required for the
simulation of a quantum system. As a matter of fact, it does not require
storing the kernel in a (expensive) multi-dimensional array, and 2) a
consistent speedup is obtained since now one can compute the kernel on the
cells of interest only, i.e. the cells occupied by signed particles. Although
this certainly represents a step forward into the direction of rapid
simulations of quantum systems, it comes at a price: the number of hidden
neurons is constrained by design to be equal to the number of cells of the
discretized real space. It is easy to see how this limitation can quickly
become an issue when very fine meshes are necessary. In this work, we continue
to ameliorate this previous approach by reducing the complexity of the neural
network and, consequently, by introducing an additional speedup. More
specifically, we propose a new network architecture which requires less neurons
than the previous approach in its hidden layer. For validation purposes, we
apply this novel technique to a well known simple, but very indicative,
one-dimensional quantum system consisting of a Gaussian wave packet interacting
with a potential barrier. In order to clearly show the validity of our
suggested approach, time-dependent comparisons with the previous technique are
presented. In spite of its simpler architecture, a good agreement is observed,
thus representing one step further towards fast and reliable simulations of
time-dependent quantum systems.

in this paper is to show how simple adaptive FIR and IIR filters can be used in
system modeling and demonstrating the application of adaptive system
identification. The main objective of our research is to study the LMS
algorithm and its improvement by the genetic search approach, namely, LMS-GA,
to search the multi-modal error surface of the IIR filter to avoid local minima
and finding the optimal weight vector when only measured or estimated data are
available. Convergence analysis of the LMS algorithm in the case of coloured
input signal, i.e., correlated input signal is demonstrated on adaptive FIR
filter via power spectral density of the input signals and Fourier transform of
the autocorrelation matrix of the input signal. Simulations have been carried
out on adaptive filtering of FIR and IIR filters and tested on white and
coloured input signals to validate the powerfulness of the genetic-based LMS
algorithm.

theoretical physics. It is the largest symmetry group associated with the most
general possible normed division algebra, namely, that of the non-associative
real octonions, which --- thanks to their non-associativity --- form the only
possible closed set of spinors (or rotors) that can parallelize the 7-sphere.
By contrast, here we show how a similar 7-sphere also arises naturally from the
algebraic interplay of the graded Euclidean primitives, such as points, lines,
planes, and volumes, which characterize the three-dimensional conformal
geometry of the ambient physical space, set within its eight-dimensional
Clifford-algebraic representation. Remarkably, the resulting algebra remains
associative, and allows us to understand the origins and strengths of all
quantum correlations locally, in terms of the geometry of the compactified
physical space, namely, that of a quaternionic 3-sphere, S3, with S7 being its
algebraic representation space. Every quantum correlation can thus be
understood as a correlation among a set of points of this S7, computed using
manifestly local spinors within S3, thereby extending the stringent bounds of
+/-2 set by Bell inequalities to the bounds of +/-2\/2 on the strengths of all
possible strong correlations, in the same quantitatively precise manner as that
predicted within quantum mechanics. The resulting geometrical framework thus
overcomes Bell's theorem by producing a strictly deterministic and realistic
framework that allows a locally causal understanding of all quantum
correlations, without requiring either remote contextuality or backward
causation.

  without discounting","completely rewritten",,,,"cs.GT math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  On ad exchange platforms the place for advertisement is sold through
different kinds of auctions. However, it is not uncommon the situation where
the seller repeatedly encounters only one buyer, thus the posted price auction
degenerates into a monopoly-monopsony game with asymmetric information and
nearly an infinite number of rounds; on each round the seller proposes the
price and the buyer accepts or rejects it.
  I learned this problem from a discussion with members of Yandex research team
and my main motivation was to find an incentive-compatible seller's strategy.
In this short paper such a strategy is proposed and a corresponding distortion
at the top type lower bound (Spence-Mirrlees property, actually) for the
surplus of the buyer is established; this shows that the proposed strategy is
the best possible.
  The key ingredients are the following. The main leash that the buyer has is
the frequency of accepted deals. Once this frequency (as a function on the
buyer's type) is fixed, the strategy randomly chooses between the {\it
rewarding} price which incentivises the buyer to reveal his type (the higher
the type, the more average surplus the buyer has), the {\it adaptation} price
which allows the buyer to communicate that his type is higher then the current
guess of the cook, and the {\it type confirmation} price which disincentivises
the buyer to pretend that his type is higher than it is.

to both the physical and the conceptual nature of human beings, and b) they do
not understand the concept of the software programming behind the operation of
a robot. The study is based on two different data collection systems: an
individual-based system and a group-based one. In both cases, the investigation
uses a complex and multimodal research structure that combines a drawing-based
approach with a conversational-discursive methodology. This paper focuses on
the individual based data collection (348 drawings and 118 interviews).
Preliminary results show that the human-like representation of robots is not
the only one, even though it is present in about 64%of the drawings, and that
this percentage decreases after the interview about robotics. Moreover, in
several cases children refer to some concepts related to programming (e.g. the
presence of sensors or human beings that make robots do things).

  Management in Dense Network","5 pages, 9 figures, conference",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ultra-dense network deployment has been proposed as a key technique for
achieving capacity goals in the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication
system. However, the deployment of smaller cells inevitably leads to more
frequent handovers, thus making mobility management more challenging and
reducing the capacity gains offered by the dense network deployment. In order
to fully reap the gains for mobile users in such a network environment, we
propose an intelligent dual connectivity mechanism for mobility management
through deep learning-based mobility prediction. We first use LSTM (Long Short
Term Memory) algorithm, one of deep learning algorithms, to learn every user
equipment's (UE's) mobility pattern from its historical trajectories and
predict its movement trends in the future. Based on the corresponding
prediction results, the network will judge whether a handover is required for
the UE. For the handover case, a dual connection will be established for the
related UE. Thus, the UE can get the radio signal from two base stations in the
handover process. Simulation results verify that the proposed intelligent dual
connectivity mechanism can significantly improve the quality of service of
mobile users in the handover process while guaranteeing the network energy
efficiency.

The connection to the thermodynamic variability is explained using missing
