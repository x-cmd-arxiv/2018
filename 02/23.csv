very low temperatures by inelastic neutron scattering. The measurements combine
different incoming energies resulting in an unprecedentedly large dynamic range
with excellent energy resolution, covering wave vectors $Q$ up to 5 \AA$^{-1}$
and energies $\omega$ up to 15 meV. A detailed description of the dynamics of
superfluid $^4$He is obtained from saturated vapor pressure up to
solidification. The single-excitation spectrum is substantially modified at
high pressures, as the maxon energy exceeds the roton-roton decay threshold. A
highly structured multi-excitation spectrum is observed at low energies, where
clear thresholds and branches have been identified. Strong phonon emission
branches are observed when the phonon or roton group velocities exceed the
sound velocity. The spectrum is found to display strong multi-excitations
whenever the single-excitations face disintegration following Pitaevskii's type
a or b criteria. At intermediate energies, an interesting pattern in the
dynamic structure factor is observed in the vicinity of the recoil energy. All
these features, which evolve significantly with pressure, are in very good
agreement with the Dynamic Many-body calculations, even at the highest
densities, where the correlations are strongest.

relate current to frequency. They can be measured by applying a periodic drive
to a DC-biased, small Josephson junction. Phase-locking between the periodic
drive and the Bloch oscillations then gives rise to steps at constant current
in the I-V curves, also known as dual Shapiro steps. Unlike conventional
Shapiro steps, a measurement of these dual Shapiro steps is impeded by the
presence of a parasitic capacitance. This capacitance shunts the junction
resulting in a suppression of the amplitude of the Bloch oscillations. This
detrimental effect of the parasitic capacitance can be remedied by an on-chip
superinductance. Additionally, we introduce a large off-chip resistance to
provide the necessary dissipation. We investigate the resulting system by a set
of analytical and numerical methods. In particular, we obtain an explicit
analytical expression for the height of dual Shapiro steps as a function of the
ratio of the parasitic capacitance to the superinductance. Using this result,
we provide a quantitative estimate of the dual Shapiro step height. Our
calculations reveal that even in the presence of a parasitic capacitance, it
should be possible to observe Bloch oscillations with realistic experimental

originate from a combination of vdW MnSe$_2$ and/or interfacial magnetism of

produces $\alpha$-MnSe(111), and an enhanced magnetic moment (~ 2x) compared to
the monolayer MnSe$_x$ samples. Detailed structural characterization by

the accelerator must be simulated, thus leading to the necessity to preserve
numerically invariants of motion over a long time interval and to a substantial
computational cost, mostly related to the repeated evaluation of the magnetic
vector potential. In this paper, in order to reduce this cost, we first
consider a specific gauge transformation that allows to reduce significantly
the number of vector potential evaluations. We then analyze the sensitivity of
the numerical solution to the interpolation procedure required to compute
magnetic vector potential data from gridded precomputed values at the locations
required by high order time integration methods. Finally, we compare several
high order integration techniques, in order to assess their accuracy and
efficiency for these long term simulations. Explicit high order Lie methods are
considered, along with implicit high order symplectic integrators and
conventional explicit Runge Kutta methods. Among symplectic methods, high order
Lie integrators yield optimal results in terms of cost/accuracy ratios, but non
symplectic Runge Kutta methods perform remarkably well even in very long term
simulations. Furthermore, the accuracy of the field reconstruction and
interpolation techniques are shown to be limiting factors for the accuracy of

  Collaboratively Learning the Best Option on Graphs, Using Bounded Local
  Memory, arXiv:1811.03968",,,,"cs.LG cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider multi-armed bandit problems in social groups wherein each
individual has bounded memory and shares the common goal of learning the best
arm/option. We say an individual learns the best option if eventually (as $t
\to \infty$) it pulls only the arm with the highest average reward. While this
goal is provably impossible for an isolated individual, we show that, in social
groups, this goal can be achieved easily with the aid of social persuasion,
i.e., communication. Specifically, we study the learning dynamics wherein an
individual sequentially decides on which arm to pull next based on not only its
private reward feedback but also the suggestions provided by randomly chosen
peers. Our learning dynamics are hard to analyze via explicit probabilistic
calculations due to the stochastic dependency induced by social interaction.
Instead, we employ the mean-field approximation method from statistical physics
and we show:
  (1) With probability $\to 1$ as the social group size $N \to \infty $, every
individual in the social group learns the best option.
  (2) Over an arbitrary finite time horizon $[0, T]$, with high probability (in
$N$), the fraction of individuals that prefer the best option grows to 1
exponentially fast as $t$ increases ($t\in [0, T]$).
  A major innovation of our mean-filed analysis is a simple yet powerful
technique to deal with absorbing states in the interchange of limits $N \to
\infty$ and $t \to \infty $. The mean-field approximation method allows us to
approximate the probabilistic sample paths of our learning dynamics by a
deterministic and smooth trajectory that corresponds to the unique solution of
a well-behaved system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Such an
approximation is desired because the analysis of a system of ODEs is relatively
easier than that of the original stochastic system.

IceCube coinciding with a LAT-detected gamma-ray burst. Dividing the neutrino

construct uncorrelated null distributions by Monte Carlo scrambling of the

sufficient gamma-ray multiplicity, and to $\nu$+$\gamma$ transient populations
responsible for $>$14% (IC40), $>$9% (IC59-North), or $>$8% (IC59-South) of the

the test statistic null distributions. However, we observe a similar and
unexpected pattern in the IC59-North and IC59-South residual distributions that
we conclude reflects a possible correlation ($p=7.0\%$) between IC59 neutrino

contact force contributions to stress act as effective stresses predicts shear
strength quite well throughout the numerically investigated range of

the effective optical depth of Lyman-{\alpha} in bins of 10, 30, 50 and 70 cMpc
h-1, construct cumulative distribution functions under two treatments of upper
limits on flux and explore an empirical analytic fit to residual Lyman-{\alpha}
transmission. We verify the consistency of our results with those of previous
studies via bootstrap re-sampling and confirm the existence of tails towards
high values in the opacity distributions, which may persist down to z = 5.2.
Comparing our results with predictions from cosmological simulations, we find
further strong evidence against models that include a spatially uniform
ionizing background and temperature-density relation. We also compare to IGM
models that include either a fluctuating UVB dominated by rare quasars or
temperature fluctuations due to patchy reionization. Although both models
produce better agreement with the observations, neither fully captures the
observed scatter in IGM opacity. Our sample of 62 z > 5.7 quasar spectra opens
many avenues for future study of the reionisation epoch.

  Variable Selection",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: The development of classification methods for personalized
medicine is highly dependent on the identification of predictive genetic
markers. In survival analysis it is often necessary to discriminate between
influential and non-influential markers. Usually, the first step is to perform
a univariate screening step that ranks the markers according to their
associations with the outcome. It is common to perform screening using Cox
scores, which quantify the associations between survival and each of the
markers individually. Since Cox scores do not account for dependencies between
the markers, their use is suboptimal in the presence highly correlated markers.
Methods: As an alternative to the Cox score, we propose the
correlation-adjusted regression survival (CARS) score for right-censored
survival outcomes. By removing the correlations between the markers, the CARS
score quantifies the associations between the outcome and the set of
""de-correlated"" marker values. Estimation of the scores is based on inverse
probability weighting, which is applied to log-transformed event times. For
high-dimensional data, estimation is based on shrinkage techniques. Results:
The consistency of the CARS score is proven under mild regularity conditions.
In simulations, survival models based on CARS score rankings achieved higher
areas under the precision-recall curve than competing methods. Two example
applications on prostate and breast cancer confirmed these results. CARS scores
are implemented in the R package carSurv. Conclusions: In research applications
involving high-dimensional genetic data, the use of CARS scores for marker
selection is a favorable alternative to Cox scores even when correlations
between covariates are low. Having a straightforward interpretation and low
computational requirements, CARS scores are an easy-to-use screening tool in
personalized medicine research.

for large-scale applications. At the same time, there is a growing trend of
non-convex optimization in machine learning community and a need for online
methods. Continuous DR-submodular functions, which exhibit a natural
diminishing returns condition, have recently been proposed as a broad class of
non-convex functions which may be efficiently optimized. Although online

we propose Meta-Frank-Wolfe, the first online projection-free algorithm that
uses stochastic gradient estimates. The algorithm relies on a careful sampling
of gradients in each round and achieves the optimal $O( \sqrt{T})$ adversarial
regret bounds for convex and continuous submodular optimization. We also
propose One-Shot Frank-Wolfe, a simpler algorithm which requires only a single
stochastic gradient estimate in each round and achieves an $O(T^{2/3})$
stochastic regret bound for convex and continuous submodular optimization. We
apply our methods to develop a novel ""lifting"" framework for the online
discrete submodular maximization and also see that they outperform current

types fluctuates in time and space, driven by temporal and spatial fluctuations
in the environment. For simplicity, our population is assumed to be composed of
just two genetic types. Short bursts of selection acting in opposing directions
drive to maintain both types at intermediate frequencies, while the
fluctuations due to 'genetic drift' work to eliminate variation in the
population.
  We consider first a population with no spatial structure, modelled by an
adaptation of the Lambda (or generalised) Fleming-Viot process, and derive a
stochastic differential equation as a scaling limit. This amounts to a limit
result for a Lambda-Fleming-Viot process in a rapidly fluctuating random
environment. We then extend to a population that is distributed across a
spatial continuum, which we model through a modification of the spatial
Lambda-Fleming-Viot process with selection. In this setting we show that the
scaling limit is a stochastic partial differential equation. As is usual with
spatially distributed populations, in dimensions greater than one, the 'genetic
drift' disappears in the scaling limit, but here we retain some stochasticity
due to the fluctuations in the environment, resulting in a stochastic p.d.e.
driven by a noise that is white in time but coloured in space.
  We discuss the (rather limited) situations under which there is a duality
with a system of branching and annihilating particles. We also write down a
system of equations that captures the frequency of descendants of particular
subsets of the population and use this same idea of 'tracers', which we learned
from Hallatschek and Nelson (2008) and Durrett and Fan (2016), in numerical

$|V(G)|^{o(|A(R)|)}$ even if $G$ is planar, unless Exponential-Time Hypothesis

network data from 75 villages, we ask 4,554 individuals to assess whether five
randomly chosen pairs of households in their village are linked through
financial, social, and informational relationships. We find that network
knowledge is low and highly localized, declining steeply with the pair's
network distance to the respondent. 46% of respondents are not even able to
offer a guess about the status of a potential link between a given pair of
individuals. Even when willing to offer a guess, respondents can only correctly
identify the links 37% of the time. We also find that a one-step increase in
the social distance to the pair corresponds to a 10pp increase in the
probability of misidentifying the link. We then investigate the theoretical
implications of this assumption by showing that the predictions of various
models change substantially if agents behave under the more realistic
assumption of incomplete knowledge about the network. Taken together, our
results suggest that the assumption of full network knowledge (i) may serve as
a poor approximation to the real world and (ii) is not innocuous: allowing for
incomplete network knowledge may have first-order implications for a range of
qualitative and quantitative results in various contexts.

also propose a method through which GRAVITY could potentially measure radial
velocities with precision $\sim 50$ km/s. If the astrometric precision can be
maintained, adding radial velocity information increases the expected number of
stars by roughly a factor of two. While we focus on GRAVITY, the results can
also be scaled to parameters relevant for future extremely large telescopes.

behaviour. Therefore, we coherently analysed archival Swift, Chandra,
XMM-Newton, RXTE, and INTEGRAL data, and we compared them with already
published ASCA data, to study its X-ray long-term spectral and flux

three orders of magnitudes, from L ~ 1.6E37 erg/s (0.3-8 keV, d=62 kpc) down to
L ~ 8E33 erg/s. RXTE, Chandra, Swift, and ASCA observed, in addition to the
expected enhancement of X-ray luminosity at periastron, flux variations by a
factor of ~ 270 with peak luminosities of ~2.1E36 erg/s far from periastron.
These properties are difficult to reconcile with the typical long-term

II outbursts. The study of AX J0049.4-7323 is complemented with a spectral
analysis of Swift, Chandra, and XMM-Newton data which showed a softening trend

technique to directly quantify the anisotropy in quantum materials, such as the
layered high-T$_c$ superconductors, anisotropic quantum spin-liquids, and the
surface states of topological insulators. Here we introduce the magnetotropic
coefficient $k=\partial^2 F/\partial \theta^2$, the second derivative of the

distinct insights into anisotropic materials akin to the difference between
magnetization and magnetic susceptibility. The thermodynamic coefficient $k$ is
discontinuous at second-order phase transitions and subject to Ehrenfest

the yield of $^4{\rm Li}$ predicted by the thermal model is 5 times bigger than

into fast and slow rotators. We also visually classify each galaxy according to
its optical morphology and two-dimensional stellar velocity field. Comparing
these classifications to quantitative $\lambda_{R_e}$ measurements reveals
tight relationships between angular momentum and galaxy structure. In order to
account for atmospheric seeing, we use realistic models of galaxy kinematics to
derive a general approximate analytic correction for $\lambda_{R_e}$. Thanks to
the size of the sample and the large number of massive galaxies, we
unambiguously detect a clear bimodality in the $(\lambda_{R_e}, \epsilon)$
diagram which may result from fundamental differences in galaxy assembly
history. There is a sharp secondary density peak inside the region of the
diagram with low $\lambda_{R_e}$ and $\epsilon < 0.4$, previously suggested as
the definition for slow rotators. Most of these galaxies are visually
classified as non-regular rotators and have high velocity dispersion. The
intrinsic bimodality must be stronger, as it tends to be smoothed by noise and
inclination. The large sample of slow rotators allows us for the first time to
unveil a secondary peak at +/-90 degrees in their distribution of the
misalignments between the photometric and kinematic position angles. We confirm
that genuine slow rotators start appearing above a stellar mass of
2\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$ where a significant number of high-mass fast rotators

motivated by visual question answering (VQA) datasets constructed in artificial
VQA settings. We propose VizWiz, the first goal-oriented VQA dataset arising
from a natural VQA setting. VizWiz consists of over 31,000 visual questions
originating from blind people who each took a picture using a mobile phone and
recorded a spoken question about it, together with 10 crowdsourced answers per
visual question. VizWiz differs from the many existing VQA datasets because (1)
images are captured by blind photographers and so are often poor quality, (2)
questions are spoken and so are more conversational, and (3) often visual
questions cannot be answered. Evaluation of modern algorithms for answering
visual questions and deciding if a visual question is answerable reveals that
VizWiz is a challenging dataset. We introduce this dataset to encourage a
larger community to develop more generalized algorithms that can assist blind
people.

chirality emerge, leading to novel phenomena such as the chiral magnetic
effect. If the chemical potential lies too far from the nodes, however, the
chiral Fermi surfaces merge into a single large Fermi surface with no net
chirality. This is realized in the WSM NbP, where the Weyl nodes lie far below
the Fermi energy and where the transport properties in low magnetic fields show
no evidence of chiral Fermi surfaces. Here we show that the behavior of NbP in
high magnetic fields is nonetheless dominated by the presence of the Weyl
nodes. Torque magnetometry up to 60 tesla reveals a change in the slope of
$\tau/B$ at the quantum limit B$^\star$ ($\approx 32\,\rm{T}$), where the
chemical potential enters the $n=0$ Landau level. Numerical simulations show
that this behaviour results from the magnetic field pulling the chemical
potential to the chiral $n=0$ Landau level belonging to the Weyl nodes. These
results show that high magnetic fields can uncover topological singularities in
the underlying band structure of a potential WSM, and can recover topologically
non-trivial experimental properties, even when the position of the chemical

between different monopoles are accompanied by the emergence of spin ""vortex"",

complexes. These two models - \v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips complexes - are built
on a homogeneous Poisson point process of intensity $n$ on a $d$-dimensional
torus using balls of radius $r_n$. In the former, the $k$-simplices/faces are
formed by subsets of $(k+1)$ Poisson points such that the balls of radius $r_n$
centred at these points have a mutual interesection and in the latter, we
require only a pairwise intersection of the balls. Given a (simplicial) complex
(i.e., a collection of $k$-simplices for all $k \geq 1$), we can connect
$k$-simplices via $(k+1)$-simplices (`up-connectivity') or via
$(k-1)$-simplices (`down-connectivity). Our interest is to understand these two
combinatorial notions of connectivity for the random \v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips
complexes asymptically as $n \to \infty$. In particular, we analyse in detail
the threshold radius for vanishing of isolated $k$-faces for up and down
connectivity of both types of random geometric complexes. Though it is expected
that the threshold radius $r_n = \Theta((\frac{\log n}{n})^{1/d})$ in coarse
scale, our results give tighter bounds on the constants in the logarithmic
scale as well as shed light on the possible second-order correction factors.
Further, they also reveal interesting differences between the phase transition
in the \v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips cases. The analysis is interesting due to the
non-monotonicity of the number of isolated $k$-faces (as a function of the
radius) and leads one to consider `monotonic' vanishing of isolated $k$-faces.
The latter coincides with the vanishing threshold mentioned above at a coarse
scale (i.e., $\log n$ scale) but differs in the $\log \log n$ scale for the
\v{C}ech complex with $k = 1$ in the up-connected case.

background (CMB) will play a major role in precision cosmology in coming years.
CMB lensing maps will enable calibration of the masses of high-redshift galaxy
clusters and will yield precise measurements of the growth of cosmic structure
through cross-correlations with galaxy surveys. During the next decade, CMB
lensing reconstruction will rely heavily on temperature data, rather than
polarization, thus necessitating a detailed understanding of biases due to
extragalactic foregrounds. In the near term, the most significant bias among
these is that due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Moreover,
high-resolution observations will be available at only a few frequencies,
making full foreground cleaning challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate a
solution to the foreground bias problem that involves cleaning only the
large-scale gradients of the CMB temperature map. We show that the data
necessary for tSZ-bias-free CMB lensing maps already exist in the form of
large-scale measurements of the CMB across multiple frequencies by the Planck
and WMAP satellite experiments. Specifically, we show that the bias to halo
masses inferred from CMB lensing is eliminated by the utilization of clean
gradients obtained from multi-frequency component separation involving Planck
and WMAP data, and that special lensing maps for galaxy cross-correlations can
be prepared with only a small penalty in signal-to-noise while requiring no
masking, in-painting, modeling, or simulation effort for the tSZ bias. While we
focus on cross-correlations, we also show that gradient cleaning can mitigate
biases to the CMB lensing autospectrum that arise from the presence of
foregrounds in temperature and polarization with minimal loss of
signal-to-noise.

governed by nonlinear PDEs. The methods rely on auxiliary functionals, which
are similar to Lyapunov functionals but satisfy different inequalities. The
inequalities are enforced by requiring certain expressions to be sums of
squares of polynomials, and the optimal choice of auxiliary functional is posed
as a semidefinite program (SDP) that can be solved computationally. To
formulate these SDPs we approximate the PDE by truncated systems of ODEs and
proceed in one of two ways. The first approach is to compute bounds for the ODE
systems, increasing the truncation order until bounds converge numerically. The
second approach incorporates the ODE systems with analytical estimates on their
deviation from the PDE, thereby using finite truncations to produce bounds for
the full PDE. We apply both methods to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, where
we compute upper bounds on the spatiotemporal average of energy by employing
polynomial auxiliary functionals up to degree six. The first approach is used
for most computations, but a subset of results are checked using the second
approach, and the results agree to high precision. These bounds apply to all
odd solutions of period $2\pi L$, where $L$ is varied. Sharp bounds are
obtained for $L\le10$, and trends suggest that more expensive computations
would yield sharp bounds at larger $L$ also. The bounds are known to be sharp
(to within 0.1% numerical error) because they are saturated by the simplest
nonzero steady states, which apparently have the largest mean energy among all
odd solutions. Prior authors have conjectured that mean energy remains $O(1)$
for $L\gg1$ since no particular solutions with larger energy have been found.
Our bounds constitute the first positive evidence for this conjecture, albeit
up to finite $L$, and they offer some guidance for analytical proofs.

training through the lens of the Hessian operator and robust optimization. In
particular, we perform a Hessian based study to analyze exactly how the
landscape of the loss function changes when training with large batch size. We
compute the true Hessian spectrum, without approximation, by back-propagating
the second derivative. Extensive experiments on multiple networks show that
saddle-points are not the cause for generalization gap of large batch size
training, and the results consistently show that large batch converges to
points with noticeably higher Hessian spectrum. Furthermore, we show that
robust training allows one to favor flat areas, as points with large Hessian
spectrum show poor robustness to adversarial perturbation. We further study
this relationship, and provide empirical and theoretical proof that the inner
loop for robust training is a saddle-free optimization problem \textit{almost

fast spinning as a consequence of recycling via mass transfer from their
companion stars; this process is also thought to decrease the magnetic field of
the neutron star being recycled. Here, we report on timing observations of the
recently discovered binary PSR J1755$-$2550 and find that this pulsar is an
exception: with a characteristic age of 2.1 Myr, it is relatively young;
furthermore, with a spin period of 315 ms and a surface magnetic field strength
at its poles of 0.88$\times$10$^{12}$ G the pulsar shows no sign of having been
recycled. Based on its timing and orbital characteristics, the pulsar either
has a massive white dwarf (WD) or a neutron star (NS) companion. To distinguish
between these two cases, we searched radio observations for a potential
recycled pulsar companion and analysed archival optical data for a potential WD
companion. Neither work returned conclusive detections. We apply population
synthesis modelling and find that both solutions are roughly equally probable.
Our population synthesis also predicts a minimum mass of 0.90 M$_{\odot}$ for
the companion star to PSR J1755$-$2550 and we simulate the systemic runaway
velocities for the resulting WDNS systems which may merge and possibly produce

These analyses reveal that the star underwent a significant flaring event

for approximately 1 minute and reached a peak flux density of $100\pm4$ mJy,
nearly a factor of $1000\times$ brighter than the star's quiescent emission. At

$|Q/I| = 0.19\pm0.02$. Since the ACA observations do not show any quiescent
excess emission, we conclude that there is no need to invoke the presence of a
dust belt at $1-4$ AU. We also posit that the slight excess flux density of
$101\pm9$ $\mu$Jy observed in the 12-m observations compared to the

turnoffs (MSTO) that have been attributed to either multiple stellar
populations or an effect of stellar rotation. Recently it has been proposed
that these extended main sequences can also be produced by ill-characterized
stellar variability. Here we present Gemini-S/GMOS time series observations of
the intermediate-age cluster NGC 1846. Using differential image analysis, we
identified 73 new variable stars, with 55 of those being of the Delta Scuti
type, that is, pulsating variables close the MSTO for the cluster age.
Considering completeness and background contamination effects we estimate the
number of Delta Scuti belonging to the cluster between 40 and 60 members,
although this number is based on the detection of a single Delta Scuti within
the cluster half-light radius. This amount of variable stars at the MSTO level
will not produce significant broadening of the MSTO, albeit higher resolution
imaging will be needed to rule out variable stars as a major contributor to the
extended MSTO phenomenon. Though modest, this amount of Delta Scuti makes NGC
1846 the star cluster with the highest number of these variables ever
discovered. Lastly, our results are a cautionary tale about the adequacy of

bifurcation in the stellar spin-period in young clusters. For example, after a
Sun-like star has eaten a Jupiter-mass planet it will spin up by ~60% (i.e.,
spin-period is reduced by ~60%), causing an apparent gap in the stellar spin
period, between stars that consumed a planet and those that did not. The
spun-up star will later spin down due to magnetic braking, consistent with the
disappearance of this bifurcation in clusters (>300Myr). The agreement between
the calculations presented here, and the observed spin-period color diagram of

infinite distances in field space coincide with an infinite tower of states
becoming massless exponentially fast in the proper field distance. The
complex-structure moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds is a good testing ground
for this conjecture since it is known to encode quantum gravity physics. We
study infinite distances in this setting and present new evidence for the above
conjecture. Points in moduli space which are at infinite proper distance along
any path are characterised by an infinite order monodromy matrix. We utilise
the nilpotent orbit theorem to show that for a large class of such points the
monodromy matrix generates an infinite orbit within the spectrum of BPS states.
We identify an infinite tower of states with this orbit. Further, the theorem
gives the local metric on the moduli space which can be used to show that the
mass of the states decreases exponentially fast upon approaching the point. We
also propose a reason for why infinite distances are related to infinite towers
of states. Specifically, we present evidence that the infinite distance itself
is an emergent quantum phenomenon induced by integrating out at one-loop the
states that become massless. Concretely, we show that the behaviour of the
field space metric upon approaching infinite distance can be recovered from
integrating out the BPS states. Similarly, at infinite distance the gauge
couplings of closed-string Abelian gauge symmetries vanish in a way which can
be matched onto integrating out the infinite tower of charged BPS states. This
presents evidence towards the idea that also the gauge theory weak-coupling
limit can be thought of as emergent.

certain momentum, is the starting point for the study of topological phases.
Dirac cones have been thoroughly explored in fermionic systems such as
graphene, Weyl semimetals, etc. The underlying mathematical structure in these
systems is a Clifford algebra -- a rule for identifying sets of matrices that
span the Hamiltonian. This structure allows for the identification of suitable
`mass' terms to open band gaps. In this article, we extend these ideas to
bosonic systems. Due to the pseudo-orthogonal nature of eigenvectors, the
algebra of matrices takes a very different form. Taking the honeycomb XY
ferromagnet as a prototype, we show that a Dirac cone emerges in the magnon
spectrum. A gap can be opened by a suitable mass term involving next-nearest
neighbour interactions. We next construct a one-dimensional ladder model with
triplon excitations. Using the new Clifford algebra, we define winding number
as a topological invariant. In analogy with the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model,
topological transitions occur when the band gap closes, leading to the
appearance (or disappearance) of protected edge states. Our results suggest a
new route to studying band touching and band topology in bosonic systems.

to simultaneously constrain the overall metallicity, [M/H], alpha-element

50.5~K, with a bolometric luminosity of 9.3~L$_{\odot}$. The near-infrared and
\textit{Spitzer} imaging show a prominent dark lane from dust extinction
separating clear bipolar outflow cavities. Observations of $^{13}$CO
($J=2\rightarrow1$), C$^{18}$O ($J=2\rightarrow1$), and other molecular lines
with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) exhibit a clear rotation signature on scales
$<$1300~AU. The rotation can be traced to an inner radius of $\sim$170~AU and
the rotation curve is consistent with an R$^{-1}$ profile, implying that
angular momentum is being conserved. Observations of the 1.3~mm dust continuum
with the SMA reveal a resolved continuum source, extended in the direction of
the dark lane, orthogonal to the outflow. The deconvolved size of the continuum
indicates a radius of $\sim$100~AU for the continuum source at the assumed
distance of 400~pc. The visibility amplitude profile of the continuum emission
cannot be reproduced by an envelope alone and needs a compact component. Thus,
we posit that the resolved continuum source could be tracing a Keplerian disk
in this very young system. If we assume that the continuum radius traces a
Keplerian disk (R$\sim$120~AU) the observed rotation profile is consistent with
a protostar mass of 1.0~$M_{\odot}$.

zero field, we find that the system undergoes a ferromagnetic transition with
both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic components at $T_{c}$ ~ 100 K. Below
$T^{*}$ ~ 50 K, the magnetic moments incline continuously toward the
out-of-plane direction. At $T$ ~ 1.5 K, where the spins are nearly aligned
along the $c$ axis, a spin reorientation occurs above a critical field $B_c$,
giving rise to a spin component perpendicular to the plane defined by the field
direction and the $c$ axis. We suggest that both the temperature- and

magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which is strongly coupled to the lattice degrees

intermediate state) the field distribution and domains' shape agrees with that
proposed by Tinkham. However, for high fields our data suggest that reality
differs from theoretical expectations. In particular, the width of the
superconducting laminae can expand near the surface leading to formation of a
maximum in the static magnetic field in the current-free space outside the
sample. A possible interpretation of these experimental results is discussed.

extend the computational domain by an absorbing layer and to use an appropriate

analysis shows that the consistency error introduced by this approach can be
made arbitrarily small by increasing the size of the extension domain or the
magnitude of the artificial absorption in the surrounding layer. A particular
choice of the reflection boundary condition allows us to circumvent the
half-space integrals that arise in the variational treatment of the original
vacuum boundary conditions and which destroy the sparse coupling observed in
numerical approximation schemes based on truncated spherical harmonics
expansions. A combination of the perfectly matched layer approach with a mixed
variational formulation and a PN-finite element approximation leads to
discretization schemes with optimal sparsity pattern and provable quasi-optimal
convergence properties. As demonstrated in numerical tests these methods are
accurate and very efficient for radiative transfer in the scattering regime.

tissue slides is becoming a routine clinical procedure for cancer diagnosis.
This process produces massive imaging data that capture histological details in
high resolution. Recent developments in deep-learning methods have enabled us
to identify and classify individual cells from digital pathology images at
large scale. The randomly distributed cells can be considered from a marked
point process, where each point is defined by its position and cell type.
Reliable statistical approaches to model such marked spatial point patterns can
provide new insight into tumor progression and shed light on the biological
mechanisms of cancer. In this paper, we consider the problem of modeling
spatial correlations among three commonly seen cells (i.e. lymphocyte, stromal,
and tumor) observed in tumor pathology images. A novel marking model of marked
point processes, with interpretable underlying parameters (some of which are
clinically meaningful), is proposed in a Bayesian framework. We use Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques, combined with the double
Metropolis-Hastings (DMH) algorithm, to sample from the posterior distribution
with an intractable normalizing constant. On the benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate how this model-based analysis can lead to sharper inferences than
ordinary exploratory analyses. Lastly, we conduct a case study on the pathology
images of 188 lung cancer patients from the National Lung Screening Trial. The
results show that the spatial correlation between tumor and stromal cells
predicts patient prognosis. This statistical methodology not only presents a
new model for characterizing spatial correlations in a multi-type spatial point
pattern, but also provides a new perspective for understanding the role of
cell-cell interactions in cancer progression.

network architecture for the policy network representation that is simple yet
effective. The proposed Structured Control Net (SCN) splits the generic MLP
into two separate sub-modules: a nonlinear control module and a linear control
module. Intuitively, the nonlinear control is for forward-looking and global
control, while the linear control stabilizes the local dynamics around the
residual of global control. We hypothesize that this will bring together the
benefits of both linear and nonlinear policies: improve training sample
efficiency, final episodic reward, and generalization of learned policy, while
requiring a smaller network and being generally applicable to different
training methods. We validated our hypothesis with competitive results on
simulations from OpenAI MuJoCo, Roboschool, Atari, and a custom 2D urban
driving environment, with various ablation and generalization tests, trained
with multiple black-box and policy gradient training methods. The proposed

high-cadence radial velocity observations might improve them. Despite the
stellar activity component being the strongest signal present in the radial
velocity time series, we are able to derive masses for both planet b ($M_{\rm
b}=6.6\pm1.1$ $M_{\rm \oplus}$) and planet c ($M_{\rm c}=3.1^{+1.3}_{-1.2}$
$M_{\rm \oplus}$). The Doppler signal due to K2-3\,d remains undetected, likely
because of its low amplitude compared to the radial velocity signal induced by
the stellar activity. The closeness of the orbital period of K2-3\,d to the
stellar rotation period could also make the detection of the planetary signal
complicated. [...]

studied analytically by reducing partial differential equations (PDEs) to
finite-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs). For the reduction,
we apply the multiple-scales method to the mixed ODE-PDE system obtained by
taking a singular limit of the PDEs. The reduced equations describe the
interface motion of a pulse solution formed by two interacting front solutions.
This motion is in qualitatively good agreement with that observed for the
original PDE system. Furthermore, it is found that the reduction not only
facilitates the analytical study of the pulse solution, especially the
specification of the onset of local bifurcations, but also allows us to
elucidate the global bifurcation structure behind the pulse behavior. As an
application, the pulse dynamics in a heterogeneous bump-type medium are
explored numerically and analytically. The reduced ODEs clarify the transition
mechanisms between four pulse behaviors that occur at different parameter
values.

multi-label classification problem. A penalized maximum log likelihood method
is proposed to impose a smoothness condition in the prediction of the

approximate the high-dimensional integration is outlined. The behavior of
DE-LSTM is thoroughly investigated by using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and
noisy observations of nonlinear dynamical systems; Mackey-Glass time series and

for two main reasons: billing and operation. Billing needs coarse-grained
measurements where there are no, or minimal, privacy concerns. On the other
hand, operation needs fine-grained measurements which can highly affect users'
privacy. Hence, users might be reluctant to participate in operational metering
to protect their privacy. To overcome this issue, UP might offer rewards to
allure users to report their measurements which endangers their privacy. In
this paper, we survey the literature on privacy-preserving metering in smart
grid. We propose a new taxonomy to categorize the literature based on whether
measurements need to be attributable to users or not. This categorization is
highly effective because attribution is one of the main causes of privacy
issues. Our survey shows that rewarding schemes and incentive-based demand
response are new research topics with limited studies on it. Hence, we propose
two privacy-preserving rewarding schemes for operational metering. First, a
light-weight solution that utilizes an already established link of trust i.e.
Banks. It is based on the assumption that banks will not leak a client account
details. This solution is based on hash chains and blind signatures to assure
users anonymity with minimal overhead for the UP and the smart meter. The bank
in this approach is state-less in which is not required the bank to keep
communications states of users and the UP. Second, we proposed another approach
that does not rely on or banks or trusted third parties. It is based on
Paillier homomorphic encryption and Pedersen commitments. It assumes that the
smart meters are organized in a tree structure; which is widely used
implementation in the literature. Security analysis for the proposed approaches
is presented including unlinkability proof for measurements to users.

still drift from the high frequencies to the low frequencies in spite of the

contribute to filling an important gap in the literature on trend testing by
presenting a class of statistical tests for trend in time censored recurrent

good power properties against both monotonic and non-monotonic trends.

complexity of this quasi-order restricted to the space of continuous functions.
Our main result is the following dichotomy: the embeddability quasi-order
restricted to continuous functions from a given compact space to another is
either an analytic complete quasi-order or a well-quasi-order. We then turn to
the existence of maximal elements with respect to embeddability in a given
Baire class. It is proved that the class of continuous functions is the only
Baire class to admit a maximal element. We prove that no Baire class admits a
maximal element, except for the class of continuous functions which admits a

generated from the prime number sequence. We show that the sequence formed by
the residues of the primes modulo $k$ are maximally chaotic and, while lacking
forbidden patterns, display a non-trivial spectrum of Renyi entropies which
suggest that every block of size $m>1$, while admissible, occurs with different
probability. This non-uniform distribution of blocks for $m>1$ contrasts
Dirichlet's theorem that guarantees equiprobability for $m=1$. We then explore
in a similar fashion the sequence of prime gap residues. This sequence is again
chaotic (positivity of Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy), however chaos is weaker as we
find forbidden patterns for every block of size $m>1$. We relate the onset of
these forbidden patterns with the divisibility properties of integers, and
estimate the densities of gap block residues via Hardy-Littlewood $k$-tuple
conjecture. We use this estimation to argue that the amount of admissible
blocks is non-uniformly distributed, what supports the fact that the spectrum
of Renyi entropies is again non-trivial in this case. We complete our analysis
by applying the Chaos Game to these symbolic sequences, and comparing the IFS
attractors found for the experimental sequences with appropriate null models.

mechanical integrity within mammalian tissues. The radius of collagen fibrils
vary widely depending on experimental conditions \textit{in vitro} or
anatomical location \textit{in vivo}. Here we explore the variety of
thermodynamically stable fibril configurations that are available. We use a
liquid crystal model of radial collagen fibril structure with a double-twist
director field. Using a numerical relaxation method we show that two
dimensionless parameters, the ratio of saddle-splay to twist elastic constants
$ k_{24}/K_{22}$ and the ratio of surface tension to chiral strength
$\hat{\gamma} \equiv \gamma/(K_{22}q)$, largely specify both the scaled fibril
radius and the associated surface twist of equilibrium fibrils. We find that
collagen fibrils are the stable phase with respect to the cholesteric phase
only when the reduced surface tension is small, $\hat{\gamma} \lesssim 0.2$.
Within this stable regime, collagen fibrils can access a wide range of radii
and associated surface twists. Remarkably, we find a maximal equilibrium
surface twist of $0.33$ rad ($19^{\text{o}}$). Our results are compatible with
corneal collagen fibrils, and we show how the large surface twist is needed to
explain the narrow distribution of corneal fibril radii. Conversely, we show
how small surface twist is required for the thermodynamic stability of tendon
fibrils in the face of considerable polydispersity of radius.

dispersion problem and, in the process, highlights discrepancies between both
schemes. Equations governing the motion of an elastic rod with a prescribed
moving velocity observed from a stationary reference frame are used to predict
propagation patterns and asymmetries in wave velocities induced as a result of
the induced linear momentum bias. Three distinct scenarios corresponding to a
moving rod with a constant modulus, a spatially varying one, and one that
varies in space and time are presented. These cases are utilized to extract and
interpret correlations pertaining to directional velocities, dispersion
patterns, as well as nature of band gaps between moving periodic media and
their stationary counterparts with time-traveling material properties. A linear
vertical shear transformation is derived and utilized to thoroughly neutralize
the effect of the moving velocity on the resultant dispersion characteristics.
Finally, dispersion contours associated with the transient response of a finite

that there are five families of purely parabolic discrete groups in

classify all these by means of their limit set and the control group. We use
first the Lie-Kolchin Theorem and Borel's fixed point theorem to show that all
purely parabolic discrete groups in $PSL(3,\Bbb{C})$ are virtually
triangularizable. Then we prove that purely parabolic groups in

of a very special type. All the virtually unipotent ones turn out to be
conjugate to subgroups of the Heisenberg group ${\rm Heis}(3,\Bbb{C})$. We
classify these using the obstructor dimension introduced by Bestvina, Kapovich

a cone of lines with base a circle or else the whole $\Bbb{P}^2_\Bbb{C}$. We
determine the relation with the Conze-Guivarc'h limit set of the action on the

the Kulkarni region of discontinuity is the largest open set where the group

method but cannot generally be applied to datasets with incomplete records. The
usual practice then is to either impute missing values under an assumed
missing-completely-at-random mechanism or to ignore the incomplete records, and
apply the algorithm on the resulting dataset. We develop an efficient version
of the $k$-means algorithm that allows for clustering in the presence of
incomplete records. Our extension is called $k_m$-means and reduces to the
$k$-means algorithm when all records are complete. We also provide
initialization strategies for our algorithm and methods to estimate the number
of groups in the dataset. Illustrations and simulations demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in a variety of settings and patterns of missing data.
Our methods are also applied to the analysis of activation images obtained from
a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiment.

galaxies and the coevolution between supermassive black holes and their host
galaxies. However, direct gas measurements are limited by sensitivity and other
uncertainties. Dust provides an efficient indirect probe of the total gas. We
apply this technique to a large sample of quasars, whose total gas content
would be prohibitively expensive to measure. We present a comprehensive study
of the full (1 to 500 micron) infrared spectral energy distributions of 87
redshift <0.5 quasars selected from the Palomar-Green sample, using photometric
measurements from 2MASS, WISE, and Herschel, combined with Spitzer mid-infrared
(5 to 40 micron) spectra. With a newly developed Bayesian Markov Chain Monte
Carlo fitting method, we decompose various overlapping contributions to the
integrated spectral energy distribution, including starlight, warm dust from
the torus, and cooler dust on galaxy scales. This procedure yields a robust
dust mass, which we use to infer the gas mass, using a gas-to-dust ratio
constrained by the host galaxy stellar mass. Most (90%) quasar hosts have gas
fractions similar to those of massive, star-forming galaxies, although a
minority (10%) seem genuinely gas-deficient, resembling present-day massive
early-type galaxies. This result indicates that ""quasar mode"" feedback does not
occur or is ineffective in the host galaxies of low-redshift quasars. We also
find that quasars can boost the interstellar radiation field and heat dust on
galactic scales. This cautions against the common practice of using the
far-infrared luminosity to estimate the host galaxy star formation rate.

shock normal angle $\theta_{Bn}$, magnetic turbulence level
$\left(b/B_0\right)^2$, and shock thickness on the acceleration efficiency of
electrons. It is shown that at perpendicular shocks the electron acceleration
efficiency is enhanced with the decreasing of $\left(b/B_0\right)^2$, and at
$\left(b/B_0\right)^2=0.01$ the acceleration becomes significant due to strong
drift electric field with long time particles staying near the shock front for
shock drift acceleration (SDA). In addition, at parallel shocks the electron
acceleration efficiency is increasing with the increasing of
$\left(b/B_0\right)^2$, and at $\left(b/B_0\right)^2=10.0$ the acceleration is
very strong due to sufficient pitch-angle scattering for first-order Fermi
acceleration, as well as due to large local component of magnetic field
perpendicular to shock normal angle for SDA. On the other hand, the high
perpendicular shock acceleration with $\left(b/B_0\right)^2=0.01$ is stronger
than the high parallel shock acceleration with ($\left(b/B_0\right)^2=10.0$),
the reason might be the assumption that SDA is more efficient than first-order
Fermi acceleration. Furthermore, for oblique shocks, the acceleration
efficiency is small no matter the turbulence level is low or high. Moreover,
for the effect of shock thickness on electron acceleration at perpendicular
shocks, we show that there exists the bend-over thickness, $L_{\text{diff,b}}$.
The acceleration efficiency does not change evidently if the shock thickness is
much smaller than $L_{\text{diff,b}}$. However, if the shock thickness is much
larger than $L_{\text{diff,b}}$, the acceleration efficiency starts to drop
abruptly.

source of CP violation for leptogenesis caused by the out-of-equilibrium decays
of heavy singlet fermions. We do so within a low-scale extended type-I seesaw
model, featuring two Standard Model singlet fermions per family, in which
lepton number is approximately conserved such that the heavy singlet neutrinos
are pseudo-Dirac. We find that this produces a predictive model of
leptogenesis. Our results show that for low-scale thermal leptogenesis, a pure
inverse-seesaw scenario fails to produce the required asymmetry, even
accounting for resonance effects, because wash-out processes are too efficient.
Dirac-phase leptogenesis is, however, possible when the linear seesaw term is
switched on, with the aid of the resonance contributions naturally present in
the model. Degenerate and hierarchical spectra are considered -- both can
achieve Dirac-phase leptogenesis, although the latter is more constrained.
Finally, although unable to probe the parameter space of Dirac-phase
leptogenesis, the contributions to unitarity violation of the PMNS matrix,
collider constraints and charged-lepton flavour-violating processes are
calculated and we further estimate the impact of the future experiments MEG-II

state information on the spectrum occupancy of primary users (PUs) in dense
multi-cell cognitive networks. Secondary users (SUs) estimate the local
spectrum occupancies and aggregate them hierarchically to estimate spectrum
occupancy at multiple spatial scales. Thus, SUs obtain fine-grained estimates
of spectrum occupancies of nearby cells, more relevant to scheduling tasks, and
coarse-grained estimates of those of distant cells. An agglomerative clustering
algorithm is proposed to design a cost-effective aggregation tree, matched to
the structure of interference, robust to local estimation errors and delays.
Given these multi-scale estimates, the SU traffic is adapted in a decentralized
fashion in each cell, to optimize the trade-off among SU cell throughput,
interference caused to PUs, and mutual SU interference. Numerical evaluations
demonstrate a small degradation in SU cell throughput (up to 15% for a 0dB
interference-to-noise ratio experienced at PUs) compared to a scheme with full
network state information, using only one-third of the cost incurred in the
exchange of spectrum estimates. The proposed interference-matched design is
shown to significantly outperform a random tree design, by providing more
relevant information for network control, and a state-of-the-art

there is a relative motion between a microphone (observer) and abovementioned
two pipe instruments (source). The calculated effective refractive indices of
these two pipe instruments are negative and varying across a set of pitches,
exhibiting a desired characteristic of broadband acoustic metamaterials. This
study suggests that recorder and clarinet may be the earliest man-made acoustic

parameterization that could be used in a coarse-resolution numerical model in
which the variation of moisture is not properly resolved. An Eulerian model
using a coarse-grained field on a grid cannot properly resolve regions of
saturation---in which condensation occurs---that are smaller than the grid
boxes. Thus, in the absence of a parameterization scheme, either the grid box
must become saturated or condensation will be underestimated. On the other
hand, in a stochastic Lagrangian model of moisture transport, trajectories of
parcels tagged with humidity variables are tracked and small-scale moisture
variability can be retained; however, explicitly implementing such a scheme in
a global model would be computationally prohibitive. One way to introduce
subgrid-scale saturation into an Eulerian model is to assume the humidity
within a grid box has a probability distribution. To close the problem, this
distribution is conventionally determined by relating the required
subgrid-scale properties of the flow to the grid-scale properties using a
turbulence closure. Here, instead, we determine an assumed probability
distribution by using the statistical moments from a stochastic Lagrangian
version of the system. The stochastic system is governed by a Fokker--Planck
equation and we use that, rather than explicitly following the moisture
parcels, to determine the parameters of the assumed distribution. We are thus
able to parameterize subgrid-scale condensation in an Eulerian model in a
computationally efficient and theoretically well-founded way. In two idealized
advection--condensation problems we show that a coarse Eulerian model with the
subgrid parameterization is well able to mimic its Lagrangian counterpart.

of the $q/(q-1)$ channel studied by Elias (1988). The $q/(q-1)$ channel has
input and output alphabet consisting of $q$ symbols, say, $Q =
\{x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_q\}$; when the channel receives an input $x \in Q$, it
outputs a symbol other than $x$ itself. Let $n(m,q,\ell)$ be the smallest $n$
for which there is a code $C \subseteq Q^n$ of $m$ elements such that for every
list $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_{\ell+1}$ of distinct code-words from $C$, there is a
coordinate $j \in [n]$ that satisfies $\{w_1[j], w_2[j], \ldots,
w_{\ell+1}[j]\} = Q$. We show that for $\epsilon<1/6$, for all large $q$ and
large enough $m$, $n(m,q, \epsilon q\ln{q}) \geq
\Omega(\exp{(q^{1-6\epsilon}/8)}\log_2{m})$. The lower bound obtained by
Fredman and Koml\'{o}s (1984) for perfect hashing implies that $n(m,q,q-1) =
\exp(\Omega(q)) \log_2 m$; similarly, the lower bound obtained by K\""{o}rner
(1986) for nearly-perfect hashing implies that $n(m,q,q) = \exp(\Omega(q))
\log_2 m$. These results show that the zero-error list-decoding capacity of the
$q/(q-1)$ channel with lists of size at most $q$ is exponentially small.
Extending these bounds, Chakraborty et al. (2006) showed that the capacity
remains exponentially small even if the list size is allowed to be as large as
$1.58q$. Our result implies that the zero-error list-decoding capacity of the
$q/(q-1)$ channel with list size $\epsilon q$ for $\epsilon<1/6$ is
$\exp{(\Omega(q^{1-6\epsilon}))}$. This resolves the conjecture raised by
Chakraborty et al. (2006) about the zero-error list-decoding capcity of the

  Process for Search Result Diversification","This research work has been accepted by DASFAA'18",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, some studies have utilized the Markov Decision Process for
diversifying (MDP-DIV) the search results in information retrieval. Though
promising performances can be delivered, MDP-DIV suffers from a very slow
convergence, which hinders its usability in real applications. In this paper,
we aim to promote the performance of MDP-DIV by speeding up the convergence
rate without much accuracy sacrifice. The slow convergence is incurred by two
main reasons: the large action space and data scarcity. On the one hand, the
sequential decision making at each position needs to evaluate the
query-document relevance for all the candidate set, which results in a huge
searching space for MDP; on the other hand, due to the data scarcity, the agent
has to proceed more ""trial and error"" interactions with the environment. To
tackle this problem, we propose MDP-DIV-kNN and MDP-DIV-NTN methods. The
MDP-DIV-kNN method adopts a $k$ nearest neighbor strategy, i.e., discarding the
$k$ nearest neighbors of the recently-selected action (document), to reduce the
diversification searching space. The MDP-DIV-NTN employs a pre-trained
diversification neural tensor network (NTN-DIV) as the evaluation model, and
combines the results with MDP to produce the final ranking solution. The
experiment results demonstrate that the two proposed methods indeed accelerate
the convergence rate of the MDP-DIV, which is 3x faster, while the accuracies
produced barely degrade, or even are better.

asymptotic performance of such tests, and in particular, the rate at which the

all two-sample tests satisfying the level constraint, and is independent of

diffusion of charged and neutral solutes in water. The neutral solute in water
shows a nonmonotonicity in the size dependence of diffusion. This is usually
connected to the well known Levitation effect where it is found that when
solute diffuses through the transient solvent cages then for attractive
solute-solvent interaction and for a particular size of the solute there is a
force balance which leads to the maximum in diffusion. Similar maximum in
diffusion of charged solutes has also been observed and connected to Levitation
effect. However, earlier studies of ionic diffusion connects this
nonmonotonicity to the interplay between hard sphere repulsion and Coulombic
attraction. In this work, we show that although the size dependence of both
charged and neutral solutes have a nonmonotonicity, there is a stark difference
in their behaviour. For charged solute with increase in attraction the maximum
shifts to higher solute sizes and has a lower value whereas for neutral solute
it remains at the same place and has a higher value. We show by studying the
ionic and non-ionic part of the potential that for larger solutes it is the
nonionic part which dominates and for smaller solutes the ionic part and the is
a transition between them. As the charge on the solute increases, this
transition takes place at larger solute sizes which leads to the shift in the
diffusivity maxima and reduction of the peak value. We show that although the
charged solutes also explore the solvent cage even before we reach the size
which Levitates due to Coulombic attraction the diffusion value drops. Thus the
origin of diffusivity maxima in charged and neutral solute diffusion is
different.

Furthermore, this penalty reduces at most exponentially with increasing $k$,
which is the case for some models, e.g., estimating high-dimensional

is re-mediated only linearly with increasing $k$, e.g. when some sub-Gaussian

logistic regression which recover or strengthen existing results.

information-theoretic lower bounds for communication-efficient estimation. We
circumvent the need for strong data processing inequalities used in prior work

include major brightness amplification (~1e11 at wavelength of 1 um) and
extreme angular resolution (~1e-10 arcsec) in a narrow field of view. A mission
to the SGL carrying a modest telescope and coronagraph opens up a possibility
for direct megapixel imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy of a habitable
Earth-like exoplanet at a distance of up to 100 light years. The entire image
of such a planet is compressed by the SGL into a region with a diameter of ~1.3
km in the vicinity of the focal line. The telescope, acting as a single pixel
detector while traversing this region, can build an image of the exoplanet with
kilometer-scale resolution of its surface, enough to see its surface features
and signs of habitability. We report here on the results of our initial study
of a mission to the deep outer regions of our solar system, with the primary
mission objective of conducting direct megapixel high-resolution imaging and
spectroscopy of a potentially habitable exoplanet by exploiting the remarkable
optical properties of the SGL. Our main goal was to investigate what it takes
to operate spacecraft at such enormous distances with the needed precision.
Specifically, we studied i) how a space mission to the focal region of the SGL
may be used to obtain high-resolution direct imaging and spectroscopy of an
exoplanet by detecting, tracking, and studying the Einstein ring around the
Sun, and ii) how such information could be used to detect signs of life on
another planet. Our results indicate that a mission to the SGL with an
objective of direct imaging and spectroscopy of a distant exoplanet is
challenging, but possible. We composed a list of recommendations on the mission

kinetic investigation on the anomalous Hall effect in chiral p-wave
superconducting states. Specifically, the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity
in the absence of the magnetic field is zero as a consequence of Galilean
invariance in our description. As for the extrinsic channel, a finite anomalous
Hall current is obtained from the impurity scattering with the optically
excited normal quasiparticle current even at zero temperature. From our kinetic
description, it can be clearly seen that the excited normal quasiparticle
current is due to an induced center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs through
the acceleration driven by ac electric field. For the induced anomalous Hall
current, we show that the conventional skew-scattering channel in the linear
response makes the dominant contribution in the strong impurity interaction. In
this case, our kinetic description as a supplementary viewpoint mostly confirms
the results of Kubo formalism in the literature. Nevertheless, in the weak
impurity interaction, this skew-scattering channel becomes marginal and we
reveal that a novel induction channel from the Born contribution dominates the
anomalous Hall current. This novel channel, which has long been overlooked in
the literature, is due to the particle-hole asymmetry by nonlinear optical
excitation. Finally, we study the case in the chiral p-wave superconducting
state with a transverse conical magnetization, which breaks the Galilean
invariance. In this situation, the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is no
longer zero. Comparison of this intrinsic channel with the extrinsic one from
impurity scattering is addressed.

samples of Hipparcos stars. The resulting IMF, derived from observations in the
range from 0.5 to 8Msun, is a two-slope broken power law with powers of -1.49
+- 0.08 and -3.02 +- 0.06 for the low-mass slope and the high-mass slope,
respectively, with a break at 1.39 +- 0.05Msun. In order to constrain the IMF
for stars more massive than 8Msun, a fast and flexible chemical enrichment
code, Chempy, was developed, which is also able to reproduce spatial and
stellar population selections of observational samples. The inferred high-mass
slope for stellar masses above 6Msun is -2.28 +- 0.09, accounting for the
systematic effects of different yield sets from the literature. This shows that
constraints from chemical modelling, similarly to hydrodynamical simulations of
the Galaxy, demand a Salpeter high-mass index. This is hard to recover from
star count analysis given the rareness of high-mass stars.

the quality of the state-of-the-art WaveNet model. The compact form of the
network makes it possible to generate 24kHz 16-bit audio 4x faster than real
time on a GPU. Second, we apply a weight pruning technique to reduce the number

large sparse networks perform better than small dense networks and this
relationship holds for sparsity levels beyond 96%. The small number of weights
in a Sparse WaveRNN makes it possible to sample high-fidelity audio on a mobile
CPU in real time. Finally, we propose a new generation scheme based on
subscaling that folds a long sequence into a batch of shorter sequences and
allows one to generate multiple samples at once. The Subscale WaveRNN produces
16 samples per step without loss of quality and offers an orthogonal method for
increasing sampling efficiency.

meaning that there were more merging commits in relation to all commits after
the projects started using Travis CI. This effect has also been reported in
related work. However, we observed the same effect in a random sample of 60
GitHub projects not using CI. Thus, it is unlikely that the effect is caused by
the introduction of CI alone. We conclude that: (1) in our sample of projects,
the introduction of CI did not lead to major changes in developers' commit
activity, and (2) it is important to compare the commit activity to a baseline

relatively constant velocity dispersions between 15 - 80 km/s and Gini

dispersions at the positions of bright star-forming clumps. We derive resolved
maps of dust attenuation and attenuation-corrected star formation rates from
emission lines for two objects in the sample. We use this information to study
the relation between resolved star formation rate and velocity dispersion. We
find that these quantities are not correlated, and the high-velocity

sequence (MS).
  Methods. The Galaxy and Mass Assembly project (GAMA) combines a spectroscopic
survey with photometric information in 21 bands from the far-ultraviolet (FUV)
to the far-infrared (FIR). Stellar masses and dust-corrected star-formation
rates (SFR) are derived from spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling using
MAGPHYS. We use the GAMA galaxy group catalogue to examine the variation of the
fraction of star-forming galaxies (SFG) and properties of the MS with respect
to the environment.
  Results. We examine the environmental dependence for stellar mass selected
samples without preselecting star-forming galaxies and study any dependence on
the host halo mass separately for centrals and satellites out to z ~ 0.3. We
find the SFR distribution at fixed stellar mass can be described by the
combination of two Gaussians (referred to as the star-forming Gaussian and the
quiescent Gaussian). Using the observed bimodality to define SFG, we
investigate how the fraction of SFG F(SFG) and properties of the MS change with
environment. For centrals, the position of the MS is similar to the field but
with a larger scatter. No significant dependence on halo mass is observed. For
satellites, the position of the MS is almost always lower (by ~0.2 dex)
compared to the field and the width is almost always larger. F(SFG) is similar
between centrals (in different halo mass bins) and field galaxies. However, for
satellites F(SFG) decreases with increasing halo mass and this dependence is
stronger towards lower redshift.

We conducted laboratory experiments simulating photochemical reactions in a
CH4-CO2 atmosphere driven by the FUV radiations dominated by the Lyman-{\alpha}
line. In the experiments, we analyzed time variations in thickness and infrared
spectra of solid organic film formed on an optical window in a reaction cell.
Gas species formed by FUV irradiation were also analyzed and compared with
photochemical model calculations. Our experimental results show that the growth
rate of the organic film decreases as the CH4/CO2 ratio of reactant gas mixture
decreases, and that the decrease becomes very steep for CH4/CO2 < 1. Comparison
with photochemical model calculations suggests that polymerizations of
gas-phase hydrocarbons, such as polyynes and aromatics, cannot account for the
growth rate of the organic film but that the addition reaction of CH3 radicals
onto the organic film with the reaction probability around 10-2 can explain the
growth rate. At CH4/CO2 < 1, etching by O atom formed by CO2 photolysis would
reduce or inhibit the growth of the organic film. Our results suggest that
organic aerosols would grow through CH3 addition onto the surface during the
precipitation of aerosol particles in the middle atmosphere of Titan and early
Earth. On Titan, effective CH3 addition would reduce C2H6 production in the
atmosphere. On early Earth, growth of aerosol particles would be less efficient
than those on Titan, possibly resulting in small-sized monomers and influencing

directionally excite highly squeezed optical mode dynamically, particularly
with an electrical bias. Such capabilities would enable the active manipulation
of light propagation for information processing and transfer. However, when the
optical source is built-in, it remains challenging to steer the excitation
directionality in a flexible way. Here, we reveal a novel mechanism for tunable
directional excitation of highly squeezed polaritons in graphene-hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures. The effect relies on controlling the sign
of the group velocity of the coupled plasmon-phonon polaritons, which can be
flipped by simply tuning the chemical potential of graphene (through
electrostatic gating) in the heterostructures. Graphene-hBN heterostructure
thus present a promising platform toward nano-photonic circuits and

  2018",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As the next generation of wireless system targets at providing a wider range
of services with divergent QoS requirements, new applications will be enabled
by the fifth generation (5G) network. Among the emerging applications,
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is an important use case targeted by
5G to enable an improved traffic safety and traffic efficiency. Since the V2X
communication requires a low end-to-end (E2E) latency and an ultra-high
reliability, the legacy cellular networks can not meet the service requirement.
In this work, we inspect on the system performance of applying the LTE-Uu and
PC5 interfaces to enable the V2X communication. With the LTE-Uu interface, one
V2X data packet is transmitted through the cellular network infrastructure,
while the PC5 interface facilitates the direct V2X communication without
involving the network infrastructure in user-plane. In addition, due to the
high reliability requirement, the application of a single V2X transmission
technology can not meet the targets in some scenarios. Therefore, we also
propose a multi-radio access technologies (multi-RATs) scheme where the data
packet travels through both the LTE-Uu and PC5 interfaces to obtain a diversity
gain. Last but not least, in order to derive the system performance, a system
level simulator is implemented in this work. The numerical results provide us
insights on how the different technologies will perform in different scenarios
and also validate the proposed multi-RATs scheme.

sparse regularization. More specifically, we analyze the BLASSO method which
estimates a sparse measure (sum of Dirac masses) from randomized sub-sampled
measurements. This is a ""continuous"", often called off-the-grid, extension of
the compressed sensing problem, where the $\ell^1$ norm is replaced by the
total variation of measures. This extension is appealing from a numerical
perspective because it avoids to discretize the the space by some grid. But
more importantly, it makes explicit the geometry of the problem since the
positions of the Diracs can now freely move over the parameter space. On a
methodological level, our contribution is to propose the Fisher geodesic
distance on this parameter space as the canonical metric to analyze
super-resolution in a way which is invariant to reparameterization of this
space. Switching to the Fisher metric allows us to take into account
measurement operators which are not translation invariant, which is crucial for
applications such as Laplace inversion in imaging, Gaussian mixtures estimation
and training of multilayer perceptrons with one hidden layer. On a theoretical
level, our main contribution shows that if the Fisher distance between spikes
is larger than a Rayleigh separation constant, then the BLASSO recovers in a
stable way a stream of Diracs, provided that the number of measurements is
proportional (up to log factors) to the number of Diracs. We measure the
stability using an optimal transport distance constructed on top of the Fisher
geodesic distance. Our result is (up to log factor) sharp and does not require
any randomness assumption on the amplitudes of the underlying measure. Our
proof technique relies on an infinite-dimensional extension of the so-called
""golfing scheme"" which operates over the space of measures and is of general
interest.

be a challenge for most machine learning tasks, including classification. A
classifier usually builds a model representing how a set of inputs explain the
outputs. The larger is the set of inputs and/or outputs, the more complex would
be that model. There is a family of classification algorithms, known as lazy
learning methods, which does not build a model. One of the best known members
of this family is the kNN algorithm. Its strategy relies on searching a set of
nearest neighbors, using the input variables as position vectors and computing
distances among them. These distances loss significance in high-dimensional
spaces. Therefore kNN, as many other classifiers, tends to worse its
performance as the number of input variables grows.
  In this work AEkNN, a new kNN-based algorithm with built-in dimensionality
reduction, is presented. Aiming to obtain a new representation of the data,
having a lower dimensionality but with more informational features, AEkNN
internally uses autoencoders. From this new feature vectors the computed
distances should be more significant, thus providing a way to choose better
neighbors. A experimental evaluation of the new proposal is conducted,
analyzing several configurations and comparing them against the classical kNN
algorithm. The obtained conclusions demonstrate that AEkNN offers better
results in predictive and runtime performance.

modelling and reasoning about networks of mobile agents broadcasting messages
to other agents following some (evolving) communication topology. The
parameterized verification of such models aims at checking whether a given
property holds irrespective of the initial configuration (number of agents,
initial states and initial communication topology). We focus here on the
synchronization property, asking whether all agents converge to a set of target
states after some execution. This problem is known to be decidable in
polynomial time when no constraints are imposed on the evolution of the
communication topology (while it is undecidable for static broadcast networks).
  In this paper we investigate how various constraints on reconfigurations
affect the decidability and complexity of the synchronization problem. In
particular, we show that when bounding the number of reconfigured links between
two communications steps by a constant, synchronization becomes undecidable; on
the other hand, synchronization remains decidable in PTIME when the bound grows
with the number of agents.

Determinantal Point Processes (DPP). DPPs have recently gained a broad interest
in the machine learning and statistics literature as random point processes
with negative correlation, i.e., ones that can generate a ""diverse"" sample from
a set of items. They are parametrized by a matrix $\mathbf{L}$, called
$L$-ensemble, that encodes the correlations between items. The standard
sampling algorithm is separated in three phases: 1/~eigendecomposition of
$\mathbf{L}$, 2/~an eigenvector sampling phase where $\mathbf{L}$'s
eigenvectors are sampled independently via a Bernoulli variable parametrized by
their associated eigenvalue, 3/~a Gram-Schmidt-type orthogonalisation procedure
of the sampled eigenvectors.
  In a naive implementation, the computational cost of the third step is on
average $\mathcal{O}(N\mu^3)$ where $\mu$ is the average number of samples of
the DPP. We give an algorithm which runs in $\mathcal{O}(N\mu^2)$ and is
extremely simple to implement. If memory is a constraint, we also describe a
dual variant with reduced memory costs. In addition, we discuss implementation

nonlinear dynamics of vertical jets of viscous liquid confined in the axial
direction due to their impact on a bath of the same liquid. Previous works
demonstrated that in the absence of axial confinement the steady liquid thread
becomes unstable due to an axisymmetric global mode for values of the flow
rate, $Q$, below a certain critical value, $Q_c$, giving rise to oscillations
of increasing amplitude that finally lead to a dripping regime (Sauter &
Buggisch, J. Fluid Mech., 2005; Rubio-Rubio et al., J. Fluid Mech., 2013). Here
we focus on the effect of the jet length, $L$, on the transitions that take
place for decreasing values of $Q$. The linear stability analysis shows good
agreement with our experiments, revealing that $Q_c$ increases monotonically
with $L$, reaching the semi-infinite jet asymptote for large values of $L$.
Moreover, as $L$ decreases a quasi-static limit is reached, whereby $Q_c \to 0$
and the neutral conditions are given by a critical length determined by
hydrostatics. Our experiments have also revealed the existence of a new regime
intermediate between steady jetting and dripping, in which the thread reaches a
limit-cycle state without breakup. We thus show that there exist three possible
states depending on the values of the control parameters, namely steady
jetting, oscillatory jetting and dripping. For two different combinations of
liquid viscosity, and injector radius, $R$, the boundaries separating these
regimes have been determined in the $Q-L$ parameter plane, showing that steady
jetting exists for small enough values of $L$ or large enough values of $Q$,
dripping prevails for small enough values of $Q$ or sufficiently large values
of $L$, and oscillatory jetting takes place in an intermediate region whose
size increases with the liquid viscosity and decreases with $R$.

for different particle pairs: p-p, p-$\mathrm{\Lambda}$, $\mathrm{K^-}$-p,
$\mathrm{K^+}$-p, p-$\mathrm{\Xi}^-$ and $\mathrm{\Lambda}$-$\mathrm{\Lambda}$.
For the p-p Argonne $v_{18}$ and Reid Soft-Core potentials have been tested.

obtained from effective Lagrangians such as $\chi$EFT for p-$\mathrm{\Lambda}$,
J\""ulich models for $\mathrm{K(\bar{K})}$-N and Nijmegen models for
$\mathrm{\Lambda}$-$\mathrm{\Lambda}$. For the p-$\mathrm{\Xi}^-$ pairs we
employ the latest lattice results from the HAL QCD collaboration. Our detailed
study of different interacting particle pairs as a function of the source size
and different potentials shows that femtoscopic measurements can be exploited
in order to constrain the final state interactions among hadrons. In
particular, small collision systems of the order of 1~fm, as produced in pp
collisions at the LHC, seem to provide a suitable environment for quantitative

cooperate and, more generally, the way to think about business processes over

business processes with business rules in order to integrate effectively single
units in an inter- or intra-organizational cooperation. Business rules
represent the knowledge that an administration has about its business; with
regard to this, they can express strategies, contracts and can influence not
only staff relations, but, finally, citizen relations, as well. In other words,
business rules are the core of an administration and affect either the business
processes or the behaviours of the system participants. They are typically
expressed implicitly in business contracts and they are embedded within the
source code of many application modules. So a concise and declarative statement
of business behaviour is converted into a set of programming instructions,
which are spread widely throughout the whole information system. In this way,
business rules are difficult to change and keep consistent over the time. For
this reason, it is necessary to reengineer the system in order to logically and
perhaps physically externalize rules from the application code. In our proposed
approach, we describe a cooperation as a collection of tasks combined in
certain ways according to the organization logic specified by business rules.
Our rule-driven methodology has the goal to make the business process design
more adaptable to the changes of internal or external environment.

[ND2H/NH2D]/[NH2D/NH3] ratio. Using gas-ice astrochemical simulations, we show
that if atomic nitrogen remains as the primary reservoir of nitrogen during

statistical value of 1/3 and lower than unity, whereas if atomic nitrogen is
largely converted into N-bearing molecules, the ratio should be larger than
unity. Observability of ammonia isotopologues in the inner hot regions around
low-mass protostars, where ammonia ice has sublimated, is also discussed. We
conclude that the [ND2H/NH2D]/[NH2D/NH3] ratio can be quantified using a

45$^\circ$ to be 0.65 (S) and 0.51 (P). On two other substrates, initially
reflective metallic mirrors, we show for slightly lower fluxes (i.e., a factor

formation of the metallic layer even in high vacuum conditions. Instead, we
observe the growth of a dielectric transparent medium. Despite the continuous
deposition of strontium, the back surface reflectivity continues to dominate.

emphasize two observations: i) a sharp threshold in the strontium flux
separating transparent material growth from lossy material growth; ii)
strontium's highly efficient capture of oxygen, even from rarefied sources:
here mostly the residual high vacuum pressure (10$^{-7}$mbar full pressure) and

image of $z$ under the moment map; after re-centering at $0$ and dilating by
$\sqrt{k}$, the re-normalized measure tends to a centered Gaussian whose
variance is the Hessian of the \kahler potential at $z$. We further give a
remainder estimate of Berry-Esseen type. The sequence $\{\mu_k^z\}$ is
generally not a sequence of convolution powers and the proofs only involve
\kahler analysis.

Given two graphs $G,H$ of the same order $n$ with adjacency matrices $A_G,A_H$,
a well-studied measure of similarity is the Frobenius distance \[
\mathrm{dist}(G,H):=\min_{\pi}\|A_G^\pi-A_H\|_F, \] where $\pi$ ranges over all

$\|M\|_F$ is the Frobenius norm of a matrix $M$. The (weighted) graph
similarity problem, denoted by SIM (WSIM), is the problem of computing this
distance for two graphs of same order. This problem is closely related to the
notoriously hard quadratic assignment problem (QAP), which is known to be
NP-hard even for severely restricted cases.
  It is known that SIM (WSIM) is NP-hard; we strengthen this hardness result by
showing that the problem remains NP-hard even for the class of trees.
Identifying the boundary of tractability for WSIM is best done in the framework
of linear algebra. We show that WSIM is NP-hard as long as one of the matrices
has unbounded rank or negative eigenvalues: hence, the realm of tractability is
restricted to positive semi-definite matrices of bounded rank. Our main result
is a polynomial time algorithm for the special case where one of the matrices

structure covered with a metal layer is driven at resonance by the Laplace
force acting on a current in a magnetic field, while the induced voltage
arising from the cut magnetic flux allows to detect the motion. The

above 1.5 K, in vacuum and gas, and introduce some features observed at lower

of simple models, from the linear regime to a highly non-linear response at
strong drives. We demonstrate that the non-linearity is mostly due to the
geometry of the vibrators. We also show that in our device the friction

its observability and its resolvability in closed form. The case of two agents
is investigated. Each agent is equipped with inertial sensors (accelerometer
and gyroscope) and with a monocular camera. By using the monocular camera, each
agent can observe the other agent. No additional camera observations (e.g., of
external point features in the environment) are considered. All the inertial
sensors are assumed to be affected by a bias. First, the entire observable
state is analytically derived. This state includes the absolute scale, the
relative velocity between the two agents, the three Euler angles that express
the rotation between the two agent frames and all the accelerometer and
gyroscope biases. Second, the paper provides the extension of the closed-form
solution given in [19] (which holds for a single agent) to the aforementioned
cooperative case. The impact of the presence of the bias on the performance of
this closed-form solution is investigated. As in the case of a single agent,
this performance is significantly sensitive to the presence of a bias on the
gyroscope, while, the presence of a bias on the accelerometer is negligible.
Finally, a simple and effective method to obtain the gyroscope bias is
proposed. Extensive simulations clearly show that the proposed method is
successful. It is amazing that, it is possible to automatically retrieve the
absolute scale and simultaneously calibrate the gyroscopes not only without any
prior knowledge (as in [13]), but also without external point features in the
environment.

gradients can strongly stabilize linear modes. While the system is linearly
stable, regimes with persistent nonlinear turbulence may develop, i.e. the
system is subcritical. A perturbation with small but finite amplitude may be
sufficient to push the plasma into a regime where nonlinear effects are
dominant and thus allow sustained turbulence. The minimum threshold for
nonlinear instability to be triggered provides a criterion for assessing
whether a tokamak is likely to stay in the quiescent (laminar) regime. At the
critical amplitude, instead of transitioning to the turbulent regime or
decaying to a laminar state, the trajectory will map out the edge of chaos.
Surprisingly, a quasi-traveling-wave solution is found as an attractor on this
edge manifold. This simple advecting solution is qualitatively similar to, but
simpler than, the avalanche-like bursts seen in earlier turbulent simulations
and provides an insight into how turbulence is sustained in subcritical plasma
systems. For large flow shearing rate, the system is only convectively

steady-state optimization, purely based on output feedback. It is well known
that the extremum seeking control loop, under certain mild conditions on the
controller, has a stable stationary periodic solution in the vicinity of an
extremum point of the steady-state input-output map of the plant. However, this
is a local result only and this paper investigates whether this solution is
necessarily unique given that the underlying optimization problem is convex. We
first derive a necessary condition that any stationary solution of the ESC loop
must satisfy. For plants in which the extremum point is due to a purely static
nonlinearity, such as in Hammerstein or Wiener plants, the condition involves
the steady-state gradient. However, for more general plants the necessary
condition involves the phase lag of the locally linearized plant, indicating
the possible existence of solutions without any relationship to optimality.
Combining the derived necessary condition with the existence of a local
solution close to the optimum, we employ bifurcation theory to trace out
branches of stationary solutions. We derive conditions on when these branches
bifurcate, resulting in multiple stationary solutions. The results show that
cyclic fold bifurcations may exist, resulting in the existence of multiple
stationary period one solutions, of which only one is related to the optimality
conditions. We illustrate the results through an example in which the
conversion in a chemical reactor is optimized using ESC. We show that at least
five stationary solutions may exist simultaneously for realistic control
parameters, and that several of these solutions are stable. One consequence of
the non-uniqueness is that one in general needs to start close to the optimum
to ensure convergence to the near-optimal solution.

number of shell and python scripts to encapsulate routine use cases. As long as
the required components are already available in SimCommSys, the user may
simulate complete communication systems of their own design without any

technologically interesting as they can be manipulated with electric fields.
Modeling the electrical manipulation of submerged layered micro-particles
analytically or numerically is not straight forward. In particular, the
generation of reliable quantitative torque predictions for electro-orientation
experiments has been elusive. The traditional Laplace model approximates the
coated particle by an ellipsoid with a confocal ellipsoidal layer and solves
Laplace's equation to produce convenient analytical predictions. However, due
to the non-uniformity of the layer thickness around the ellipsoid, this method
can lead to incorrect torque predictions. Here we present a new theoretical
dual-ellipsoid Laplace model that corrects the effect of the non-uniform layer
thickness by calculating two layered ellipsoids, each accounting for the
correct layer thickness along each relevant direction for the torque. Our model
describes the electro-orientation of submerged lipid-coated graphitic
micro-particles in the presence of an alternating current (AC) electric field
and is valid for ellipsoids with moderate aspect ratios and coated with thin
shells. It is one of the first models to generate correct quantitative electric
torque predictions. We present model results for the torque versus frequency
and compare them to our measurements for lipid-coated highly ordered pyrolytic
graphite (HOPG) micro-flakes in aqueous NaCl solution at MHz frequencies. The
results show how the lipid shell changes the overall electrical properties of
the micro-flakes so that the torque is low at low frequencies and increases at
higher frequencies into the MHz regime. The torque depends critically on the
lipid-shell thickness, the solution conductivity and the shape of the particle,
all of which can be used as handles to control the response of the particles.

state, in which the granular soil layer supports structures placed on its
surface, toa fluidlike state, in which structures placed initially on the
surface sink to their isostatic depth within the granularlayer.We suggest a
simple theoretical model for soil liquefaction and show that buoyancy caused by
the presence ofwater inside a granular medium has a dramatic influence on the
stability of an intruder resting at the surface of themedium.We confirm this
hypothesis by comparison with laboratory experiments and discrete-element
numericalsimulations. The external excitation representing ground motion during
earthquakes is simulated via horizontalsinusoidal oscillations of controlled
frequency and amplitude. In the experiments, we use particles only
slightlydenser than water, which as predicted theoretically increases the
effect of liquefaction and allows clear depth-of-sinkingmeasurements. In the
simulations, a micromechanical model simulates grains using molecular
dynamicswith friction between neighbors. The effect of the fluid is captured by
taking into account buoyancy effects onthe grains when they are immersed. We
show that the motion of an intruder inside a granular medium is mainlydependent
on the peak acceleration of the ground motion and establish a phase diagram for
the conditions underwhich liquefaction happens, depending on the soil bulk
density, friction properties, presence of water, and peak acceleration of the
imposed large-scale soil vibrations.We establish that in liquefaction
conditions, most cases relaxtoward an equilibrium position following an
exponential in time.We also show that the equilibrium position itself,for most
liquefaction regimes, corresponds to the isostatic equilibrium of the intruder
inside a medium of effectivedensity. The characteristic time to relaxation is
shown to be essentially a function of the peak ground velocity.

baseline, our approach simplifies existing methods that binarize weights by
applying the sign function in training; we apply scaling factors for each layer
with constant unlearned values equal to the layer-specific standard deviations
used for initialization. For CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, and models with
1-bit-per-weight requiring less than 10 MB of parameter memory, we achieve
error rates of 3.9%, 18.5% and 26.0% / 8.5% (Top-1 / Top-5) respectively. We
also considered MNIST, SVHN and ImageNet32, achieving 1-bit-per-weight test

rates halve previously reported values, and are within about 1% of our
error-rates for the same network with full-precision weights. For networks that
overfit, we also show significant improvements in error rate by not learning
batch normalization scale and offset parameters. This applies to both full
precision and 1-bit-per-weight networks. Using a warm-restart learning-rate
schedule, we found that training for 1-bit-per-weight is just as fast as

achieve 100% statement, branch, MC/DC coverage, more than 80% of functions in
SQLite achieve 100% MC/DC coverage, and more than 60% of functions in

analyze the reasons of low coverage in automated unit testing in our setting

construct a many-body coarse-grained potential. The network is trained with
full atomistic data in a way that preserves the natural symmetries of the
system. The resulting model is very accurate and can be used to sample the
configurations of the coarse-grained variables in a much faster way than with
the original atomistic model. As an application we consider liquid water and
use the oxygen coordinates as the coarse-grained variables, starting from a
full atomistic simulation of this system at the ab-initio molecular dynamics

model transportation networks. For the problem, a graph $G=(V,E)$ with edge
lengths and an integer $k$ are given and a center set $C\subseteq V$ needs to
be chosen such that $|C|\leq k$. The aim is to minimize the maximum distance of
any vertex in the graph to the closest center. This problem arises in many
applications of logistics, and thus it is natural to consider inputs that model
transportation networks. Such inputs are often assumed to be planar graphs, low
doubling metrics, or bounded highway dimension graphs. For each of these
models, parameterized approximation algorithms have been shown to exist. We
complement these results by proving that the $k$-Center problem is W[1]-hard on
planar graphs of constant doubling dimension, where the parameter is the
combination of the number of centers $k$, the highway dimension $h$, and the
pathwidth $p$. Moreover, under the Exponential Time Hypothesis there is no
$f(k,p,h)\cdot n^{o(p+\sqrt{k+h})}$ time algorithm for any computable function
$f$. Thus it is unlikely that the optimum solution to $k$-Center can be found
efficiently, even when assuming that the input graph abides to all of the above
models for transportation networks at once!
  Additionally we give a simple parameterized $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for inputs of doubling dimension $d$ with runtime
$(k^k/\varepsilon^{O(kd)})\cdot n^{O(1)}$. This generalizes a previous result,
which considered inputs in $D$-dimensional $L_q$ metrics.

advantages of using character level data for training have been outlined in

from both the modalities jointly for script identification task. We take
handwritten data in either modality as input and the opposite modality is
generated through intermodality conversion. Thereafter, we feed this
offline-online modality pair to our network. Hence, along with the advantage of
utilizing information from both the modalities, it can work as a single
framework for both offline and online script identification simultaneously
which alleviates the need for designing two separate script identification
modules for individual modality. One more major contribution is that we propose
a novel conditional multimodal fusion scheme to combine the information from
offline and online modality which takes into account the real origin of the
data being fed to our network and thus it combines adaptively. An exhaustive
experiment has been done on a data set consisting of English and six Indic
scripts. Our proposed framework clearly outperforms different frameworks based
on traditional classifiers along with handcrafted features and deep learning
based methods with a clear margin. Extensive experiments show that using only

adiabaticity (STA), but different definitions of ""cost"" have been used. We
demonstrate the importance of taking into account the Control System (CS) for a
fair assessment of energy flows and consumptions. We model the energy
consumption and power to transport an ion by a STA protocol in a multisegmented
Paul trap. The ion is driven by an externally controlled, moving harmonic
oscillator. Even if no net ion- energy is gained at destination, setting the
time-dependent control parameters is a macroscopic operation that costs energy
and results in energy dissipation for the short time scales implied by the
intrinsically fast STA processes. The potential minimum is displaced by
modulating the voltages on control (dc) electrodes. A secondary effect of the
modulation, usually ignored as it does not affect the ion dynamics, is the
time- dependent energy shift of the potential minimum. The non trivial part of
the energy consumption is due to the electromotive forces to set the electrode
voltages through the low-pass filters required to preserve the electronic noise
from decohering the ion's motion. The results for the macroscopic CS (the Paul
trap) are compared to the microscopic power and energy of the ion alone.
Similarities are found -and may be used quantitatively to minimize costs- only
when the CS-dependent energy shift of the harmonic oscillator is included in
the ion energy.

regularized by performing an integral average of the distributional terms over
some finite volume; I argue that such a regularization is appropriate if one
regards quantum general relativity (from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation may
be derived) to be the low-energy effective field theory of a full theory of
quantum gravity. I also show that a volume average regularization can be viewed
as a natural generalization of the same-variable second partial derivative for
an ordinary multivariable function. Using the regularized second functional

The analysis reveals that in a given isocrater impact, asteroidal impactors
produce anomalies in the interior of smaller spatial extent than cometary or
similar impactors. The differences in the interior could be useful for
characterizing the projectile that formed a given crater on the basis of
geophysical observations and potentially offer a possibility to help constrain
the demographics of the ancient impactor population. A series of numerical
models of basin-forming impacts on Mercury, Venus, the Moon, and Mars
illustrates the dynamical effects of the different impactor types on different

much of the anomaly merges with the growing lid. On the other hand, their
signature will long have been destroyed in Venus, whose vigorous convection and
recurring lithospheric instabilities obliterate larger coherent anomalies.

from the SDSS/NVSS/FIRST sample of Best & Heckman (2012), with redshift $\leq$
0.15, radio size $\leq$ 10 kpc and optically classified as low-excitation
galaxies (LEG). The X-ray spectra are modeled with a power-law component
absorbed by Galactic column density with, in some cases, a contribution from
thermal extended gas. The X-ray photons are likely produced by the jet as
attested by the observed correlation between X-ray (2-10 keV) and radio (5 GHz)
luminosities, similar to FRIs. The estimated Eddington-scaled luminosities
indicate a low accretion rate. Overall, we find that the X-ray properties of
FR0s are indistinguishable from those of FRIs, thus adding another similarity
between AGN associated with compact and extended radio sources. A comparison
between FR0s and low luminosity BL Lacs, rules out important beaming effects in
the X-ray emission of the compact radio galaxies. FR0s have different X-ray
properties with respect to young radio sources (e.g. GPS/CSS sources),
generally characterized by higher X-ray luminosities and more complex spectra.
In conclusion, the paucity of extended radio emission in FR0s is probably
related to the intrinsic properties of their jets that prevent the formation of
extended structures, and/or to intermittent activity of their engines.

traffic dynamics under variable speed limit control. Two different control
problems are studied: the problem with free speed limits at the inlet and the
problem with no speed limits at the inlet. Explicit formulas are provided for
respective feedback laws that guarantee stabilization of the desired
equilibrium profile. For the first problem, global asymptotic stabilization is
achieved; while for the second problem, regional exponential stabilization is
achieved. Moreover, the solutions for the corresponding closed-loop systems are
guaranteed to be classical solutions, i.e., there are no shocks. The obtained

implicit definability, tailored to the intended real-valued semantics and
referring to the elements of its domain, is introduced. Several variants of
implicitly defining each of the rational elements in the standard semantics are
explored, and based on that, a faithful interpretation of theories in Rational
Pavelka logic in theories in {\L}ukasiewicz logic is obtained. Some of these
results were already presented in H\'ajek's ""Metamathematics of Fuzzy Logic"" as
technical statements. A connection to the lack of (deductive) Beth property in
{\L}ukasiewicz logic is drawn. Moreover, while irrational elements of the
standard semantics are not implicitly definable by finitary means, a parallel
development is possible for them in the infinitary {\L}ukasiewicz logic. As an
application of definability of the rationals, it is shown how computational
complexity results for Rational Pavelka logic can be obtained from analogous
results for {\L}ukasiewicz logic. The complexity of the definability notion
itself is studied as well. Finally, we review the import of these results for
the precision/vagueness discussion for fuzzy logic, and for the general

gain of the phased antenna array in excess to the omni-directional path gain.
The total array gain circumvents the ambiguity of conventional array gain which
cannot be uniquely defined as there are multiple choices of a reference
single-element antenna in an array. Two types of 8-element patch antenna arrays
implemented on a mobile phone chassis, i.e., uniform linear array (ULA) and
distributed array (DA) both operating at 60 GHz, are studied. The gain
evaluated in a small-cell scenario in an airport shows that DA achieves higher
median and outage gain by up to 8 and 6 dB than ULA when different orientations
of the mobile phone are considered along with body torso and finger shadowing.
There are always postures of the mobile phone where ULA cannot see the
line-of-sight due to directionality of the patch antenna and of body and finger
shadowing, leading to outage gain of -15 dB in the worst case. The DA has much
smaller variation of the gain across different orientations of the phone, even
when the human torso shadowing and user's finger effects are considered.

drift between transmitter and receiver due to synchronization errors. We
determine an appropriate choice for state space limits based on the drift
probability distribution. In turn, we obtain an expression for the decoder

used. For a given state space, we also give a number of optimizations that
reduce the algorithm complexity with no further loss of decoder performance. We
also show how the MAP decoder can be used in the absence of known frame

allows the decoder to approach the performance when frame boundaries are known,
at the expense of some increase in complexity. Finally, we express some
existing constructions as TVB codes, comparing performance with published

subwavelength object exceeding the single-channel limit, has important
prospects in enhanced sensing/spectroscopy, solar cells, and biomedical
imaging. Superscattering can be typically constructed only at a single
frequency regime, and depends critically on the inescapable material losses.
Under such realistic conditions, superscattering has not been predicted nor
observed to exist simultaneously at multiple frequency regimes. Here we
introduce multifrequency superscattering in a subwavelength hyperbolic
structure, which can be made from artificial metamaterials or from
naturally-existing materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (BN), and show
the advantage of such hyperbolic materials for reducing structural complexity.
The underlying mechanism is revealed to be the multimode resonances at multiple
frequency regimes as appear in BN due to the peculiar dispersion of
phonon-polaritons. Importantly, the multifrequency superscattering has a high
tolerance to material losses and some structural variations, bringing the
concept of multifrequency superscattering closer to useful and realistic

architecture which comprises of separate units for storage and computations.
The energy expensive transfer of data from the memory units to the computing
cores results in the well-known von-Neumann bottleneck. Various approaches
aimed towards bypassing the von-Neumann bottleneck are being extensively
explored in the literature. Emerging non-volatile memristive technologies have
been shown to be very efficient in computing analog dot products in an in-situ
fashion. The memristive analog computation of the dot product results in much
faster operation as opposed to digital vector in-memory bit-wise Boolean
computations. However, challenges with respect to large scale manufacturing
coupled with the limited endurance of memristors have hindered rapid
commercialization of memristive based computing solutions. In this work, we
show that the standard 8 transistor (8T) digital SRAM array can be configured
as an analog-like in-memory multi-bit dot product engine. By applying
appropriate analog voltages to the read-ports of the 8T SRAM array, and sensing
the output current, an approximate analog-digital dot-product engine can be
implemented. We present two different configurations for enabling multi-bit dot
product computations in the 8T SRAM cell array, without modifying the standard

structure, it can be used as a storage element with standard read-write

exploitation. Evolutionary niching is implemented in GAtor by using machine
learning to cluster the dynamically updated population by structural similarity
and then employing a cluster-based fitness function. Evolutionary niching
promotes uniform sampling of the potential energy surface by evolving several
sub-populations, which helps overcome initial pool biases and selection biases
(genetic drift). The various settings offered by GAtor increase the likelihood
of locating numerous low-energy minima, including those located in
disconnected, hard to reach regions of the potential energy landscape. The best
structures generated are re-relaxed and re-ranked using a hierarchy of
increasingly accurate DFT functionals and dispersion methods. GAtor is applied
to a chemically diverse set of four past blind test targets, characterized by
different types of intermolecular interactions. The experimentally observed
structures and other low-energy structures are found for all four targets. In
particular, for Target II, 5-cyano-3-hydroxythiophene, the top ranked putative
crystal structure is a $Z^\prime$=2 structure with P$\bar{1}$ symmetry and a
scaffold packing motif, which has not been reported previously.

contrast to the often used Alternating Direction of Multipliers Method (ADMM),
ALADIN guarantees locally quadratic convergence for AC OPF. Numerical results
for 5 to 300 bus test cases indicate that ALADIN is able to outperform ADMM and
to reduce the number of iterations by about one order of magnitude. We compare
ALADIN to numerical results for ADMM documented in the literature. The improved
convergence speed comes at the cost of increasing the communication effort per
iteration. Therefore, we propose a variant of ALADIN that uses inexact Hessians
to reduce communication. Additionally, we provide a detailed comparison of
these ALADIN variants to ADMM from an algorithmic and communication

modifying consumption profile. Some of these programs are based on economic
incentives, in which, a user is paid to reduce his energy requirements
according to an estimated baseline. Literature review and practice have shown
that the counter-factual models of employing baselines are vulnerable for
gaming. Classical solutions of mechanism design require that agents communicate
their full types which result in greater difficulties for its practical
implementation. In this paper, a novel contract is developed to induce
individual rationality (voluntary participation) and asymptotic
incentive-compatibility (truthfulness) through probability of call, where an
agent does not require to report the marginal utility. In this approach, a
consumer only announces the baseline and reduction capacity, given a payment
scheme that includes cost of electricity, incentive price, and penalty caused
by any deviation between self-reported and actual energy consumption. The
aggregator decides randomly what users are called to perform the energy
reduction. As result, asymptotic truth-telling behavior in incentive-based DR
is managed by the aggregator through the probability of call for each agent.
Mathematical proofs and numerical studies are provided to demonstrate the
properties and advantages of this contract in limiting gaming opportunities and

analysis are two distinct, coarse-grained approaches to study conformational
flexibility of macromolecules. In the two decades since their introduction,
both have contributed significantly to insights into protein molecular
mechanisms and function. However, despite a shared purpose of these approaches,
the topological nature of rigidity analysis, and thereby the absence of motion
modes, has impeded a direct comparison. Here, we present an alternative,
kinematic approach to rigidity analysis, which circumvents these drawbacks. We
introduce a novel protein hydrogen bond network spectral decomposition, which
provides an orthonormal basis for collective motions modulated by non-covalent
interactions, analogous to the eigenspectrum of normal modes, and decomposes
proteins into rigid clusters identical to those from topological rigidity. Our
kinematic flexibility analysis bridges topological rigidity theory and ENM, and
enables a detailed analysis of motion modes obtained from both approaches. Our
analysis reveals that collectivity of protein motions, reported by the Shannon
entropy, is significantly lower for rigidity theory versus normal mode
approaches. Strikingly, kinematic flexibility analysis suggests that the
hydrogen bonding network encodes a protein-fold specific, spatial hierarchy of
motions, which goes nearly undetected in ENM. This hierarchy reveals distinct
motion regimes that rationalize protein stiffness changes observed from
experiment and molecular dynamics simulations. A formal expression for changes
in free energy derived from the spectral decomposition indicates that motions
across nearly 40% of modes obey enthalpy-entropy compensation. Taken together,
our analysis suggests that hydrogen bond networks have evolved to modulate
protein structure and dynamics.

have taken place. Currently, we have discovered hundreds of earth-sized
planets, several of them within the habitable zone of their star. In the coming
years, the efforts will concentrate in the characterization of these planets
and their atmospheres to try to detect the presence of biosignatures. However,
even if we discovered a second Earth, it is very unlikely that it would present
a stage of evolution similar to the present-day Earth. Our planet has been far
from static since its formation about 4.5 Ga ago; on the contrary, during this
time, it has undergone multiple changes in it's atmospheric composition, it's
temperature structure, it's continental distribution, and even changes in the
forms of life that inhabit it. All these changes have affected the global
properties of Earth as seen from an astronomical distance. Thus, it is of
interest not only to characterize the observables of the Earth as it is today,
but also at different epochs. Here we review the detectability of the Earth's
globally-averaged properties over time. This includes atmospheric composition
and biosignatures, and surface properties that can be interpreted as sings of
habitability (bioclues). The resulting picture is that truly unambiguous
biosignatures are only detectable for about 1/4 of the Earth's history. The
rest of the time we rely on detectable bioclues that can only establish an
statistical likelihood for the presence of life on a given planet.

time-consuming, which is in part evidenced by the fact that only 100 out of
over 7,000 languages spoken in the world are fully covered in WALS.
  We learn distributed language representations, which can be used to predict
typological properties on a massively multilingual scale. Additionally,
quantitative and qualitative analyses of these language embeddings can tell us
how language similarities are encoded in NLP models for tasks at different
typological levels. The representations are learned in an unsupervised manner
alongside tasks at three typological levels: phonology (grapheme-to-phoneme
prediction, and phoneme reconstruction), morphology (morphological inflection),
and syntax (part-of-speech tagging).
  We consider more than 800 languages and find significant differences in the
language representations encoded, depending on the target task. For instance,
although Norwegian Bokm{\aa}l and Danish are typologically close to one
another, they are phonologically distant, which is reflected in their language
embeddings growing relatively distant in a phonological task. We are also able
to predict typological features in WALS with high accuracies, even for unseen
language families.

software product innovation in large companies and identifies its enablers and
inhibitors. A multiple case study approach is followed in the investigation.
Two software product innovation projects from two large companies are examined,
using a conceptual framework that is based on the method-in-action framework
and extended with the previously developed Lean-Internal Corporate Venture
model. Seven face-to-face in-depth interviews of the employees with different
roles are conducted. Within-case analysis and cross-case comparison are applied
to draw the findings from the cases. A generic process flow summarises the
common key processes of Lean internal startups. The findings suggest that an
internal startup that is initiated management or employees faces different
challenges. A list of enablers of applying Lean startup in large companies are
identified, including top management support and cross-functional team. Both
cases face different inhibitors due to the different process of inception,
objective of the team and type of the product. Our contributions are threefold.
First, this study is one of the first attempt to investigate the use of Lean
startup approach in large companies empirically. Second, the study shows the
potential of the method-in-action framework to investigate the Lean startup
approach in non-startup context. The third is a general process of Lean
internal startup and the evidence of the enablers and inhibitors of
implementing it, which are both theory-informed and empirically grounded.

Therefore, the security and reliability of such programs should be guaranteed

However, programs may be developed by different high-level programming
languages, and a general, extensible, and reusable formal memory (GERM)
framework that can simultaneously support different formal verification
specifications, particularly at the code level, is presently unavailable for
verifying the properties of programs. Therefore, the present work proposes a
GERM framework to fill this gap. The framework simulates physical memory
hardware structure, including a low-level formal memory space, and provides a
set of simple, nonintrusive application programming interfaces and assistant
tools using Coq that can support different formal verification specifications
simultaneously. The proposed GERM framework is independent and customizable,
and was verified entirely in Coq. We also present an extension of Curry-Howard
isomorphism, denoted as execution-verification isomorphism (EVI), which
combines symbolic execution and theorem proving for increasing the degree of
automation in higher-order logic theorem proving assistant tools. We also
implement a toy functional programming language in a generalized algebraic
datatypes style and a formal interpreter in Coq based on the GERM framework.
These implementations are then employed to demonstrate the application of EVI
to a simple code segment.

feedback, is studied taking into account the non-linearity characteristic of
real-world transistors. This has been accomplished by employing a recently
proposed Early modeling approach, which allowed the analytical equations to be
obtained describing the current and voltage behavior in the adopted common
emitter circuit. Average and dispersion (coefficient of variation) of the
current and voltage gains can then be calculated and used to characterize the
common emitter amplification while reflecting the transistor non-linearity.
Several interesting results were obtained, including the fact that the negative
feedback provided by the emitter resistance is not capable of completely
eliminating effects of parameters differences exhibited by transistors.
Importantly, transistors with larger Early voltage $V_a$ magnitudes tended to
provide significantly enhanced linearity even when substantial negative
feedback is used. These results motivates customized design, implementation and

communication hole even in highly dense networks. These communication holes
cannot be totally eliminated even when the deployment is done in a structured
manner. In either case, the resulting inter-node distances may degrade the
performance of the network. This paper proposes an enhanced deployment
algorithm based on Artificial Bees Colony (ABC). The ABC-based deployment is
guaranteed to extend the lifetime by optimizing the network parameters and
constraining the total number of deployed relays. Simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed strategy under different cases of problem
complexity. Results show that the proposed approach improves the network
lifetime considerably when compared to solutions reported in the literature
such as Shortest Path 3-D grid Deployment (SP3D) algorithm.

oscillator (representing an elastic frame) coupled with a rocking wall. Two
types of rocking walls namely stepping rocking wall and pinned rocking wall are
presented and analyzed. For each case, full nonlinear equations of motions are
calculated. The dynamic behavior of the systems shows mixed results in
suppressing the dynamic response of the elastic oscillator. Through
comprehensive analysis, pinned rocking wall amplifies the displacement along
wide range of the spectrum, in the other hand, stepping rocking wall is the
most effective especially in relatively flexible structures and with a heavier
wall. This is mainly because of the pinned wall's mass works against its
stability. In this study, a simple, oscillator-rocking-wall model is defined
and analyzed using OpenSees and, the results from OpenSees shows a good
agreement with equation of motion solution using MATLAB.

  single-threads","28 pages; 7 figures",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computing is still based on the 70-years old paradigms introduced by von
Neumann. The need for more performant, comfortable and safe computing forced to
develop and utilize several tricks both in hardware and software. Till now
technology enabled to increase performance without changing the basic computing
paradigms. The recent stalling of single-threaded computing performance,
however, requires to redesign computing to be able to provide the expected
performance. To do so, the computing paradigms themselves must be scrutinized.
The limitations caused by the too restrictive interpretation of the computing
paradigms are demonstrated, an extended computing paradigm introduced, ideas
about changing elements of the computing stack suggested, some implementation
details of both hardware and software discussed. The resulting new computing
stack offers considerably higher computing throughput, simplified hardware
architecture, drastically improved real-time behavior and in general,
simplified and more efficient computing stack.

$1/g^{\alpha}$ in the transfer-matrix of 2d U(1) lattice gauge theory are
explored. It is seen by the $\alpha=1$ choice that the lowest energy develops a
minimum at coupling $g_*=1.125$, leading to a \textit{multi-valued} Gibbs
energy similar to the systems with the first-order phase transition. It is
argued how the $1/g$ normalization may be regarded as a lost normalization in
the commonly used change of variable to the dimensionless angle-variables.
Based on the continuum limit at the next-leading order and the Ostrogradsky
formulation of higher-order time-derivatives theories, it is argued that the
spectrum at continuum is compatible only with the $\alpha=1$ choice.

increasingly better devices to generate random numbers. Today, randomness is
fundamental to security and cryptographic systems, as well as safeguarding
privacy. A key challenge with random number generators is that it is hard to
ensure that their outputs are unpredictable. For a random number generator
based on a physical process, such as a noisy classical system or an elementary
quantum measurement, a detailed model describing the underlying physics is
required to assert unpredictability. Such a model must make a number of
assumptions that may not be valid, thereby compromising the integrity of the
device. However, it is possible to exploit the phenomenon of quantum
nonlocality with a loophole-free Bell test to build a random number generator
that can produce output that is unpredictable to any adversary limited only by
general physical principles. With recent technological developments, it is now
possible to carry out such a loophole-free Bell test. Here we present certified
randomness obtained from a photonic Bell experiment and extract 1024 random
bits uniform to within $10^{-12}$. These random bits could not have been
predicted within any physical theory that prohibits superluminal signaling and
allows one to make independent measurement choices. To certify and quantify the
randomness, we describe a new protocol that is optimized for apparatuses
characterized by a low per-trial violation of Bell inequalities. We thus
enlisted an experimental result that fundamentally challenges the notion of
determinism to build a system that can increase trust in random sources. In the
future, random number generators based on loophole-free Bell tests may play a
role in increasing the security and trust of our cryptographic systems and
infrastructure.

field (GRF) is maximum likelihood estimation combined with kriging. For massive
data sets, kriging is computationally intensive, both in terms of CPU time and
memory, and so fixed rank kriging has been proposed as a solution. The method
however still involves operations on large matrices, so we develop an
alteration to this method by utilizing the approximations made in fixed rank
kriging combined with restricted maximum likelihood estimation and sparse
matrix methodology. Experiments show that our methodology can provide
additional gains in computational efficiency over fixed-rank kriging without
loss of accuracy in prediction. The methodology is applied to climate data
archived by the United States National Climate Data Center, with very good
results.
