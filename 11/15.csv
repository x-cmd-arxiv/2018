  Glaser, Robert Zeier","Phase Spaces, Parity Operators, and the Born-Jordan Distribution","56 pages, 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phase spaces as given by the Wigner distribution function provide a natural
description of infinite-dimensional quantum systems. They are an important tool
in quantum optics and have been widely applied in the context of time-frequency
analysis and pseudo-differential operators. Phase-space distribution functions
are usually specified via integral transformations or convolutions which can be
averted and subsumed by (displaced) parity operators proposed in this work.
Building on earlier work for Wigner distribution functions [A. Grossmann, Comm.
Math. Phys. 48(3), 191 (1976)], parity operators give rise to a general class
of distribution functions in the form of quantum-mechanical expectation values.
This enables us to precisely characterize the mathematical existence of general
phase-space distribution functions. We then relate these distribution functions
to the so-called Cohen class [L. Cohen, J. Math. Phys. 7(5), 781 (1966)] and
recover various quantization schemes and distribution functions from the
literature. The parity-operator approach is also applied to the Born-Jordan
distribution which originates from the Born-Jordan quantization [M. Born, P.
Jordan, Z. Phys. 34(1), 858 (1925)]. The corresponding parity operator is
written as a weighted average of both displacements and squeezing operators and
we determine its generalized spectral decomposition. This leads to an efficient
computation of the Born-Jordan parity operator in the number-state basis and
example quantum states reveal unique features of the Born-Jordan distribution.

weak signals from distant sources received together with strong nearby
interferers. When the techniques of random modulation are used in communication
system receivers, one can design a spectrally shaped sequence that mitigates
interferer bands while preserving message bands. Common implementation
constraints require sequence quantization, which turns the design problem
formulation to an integer optimization problem solved using a semidefinite
program on a matrix that is restricted to have rank one. Common approximation
schemes for this problem are not amenable due to the distortion to the spectrum
caused by the required quantization. We propose a method that leverages a
randomized projection and quantization of the solution of a semidefinite
program, an approach that has been previously used for related integer
programs. We provide a theoretical and numerical analysis on the feasibility
and quality of the approximation provided by the proposed approach.
Furthermore, numerical simulations show that our proposed approach returns the
same sequence as an exhaustive search (when feasible), showcasing its accuracy
and efficiency. Furthermore, our proposed method succeeds in finding suitable
spectrally shaped sequences for cases where exhaustive search is not feasible,
achieving better performance than existing alternatives.

treat molecular reactions in solution. A constraint functional based on energy
conservation is introduced which ensures that the dominant paths contributing
to the reaction rate are sampled. We prove that the theory gives exact results

for anharmonic systems, and even gives good predictions for rates in the Marcus

Extremely-bright, ultrashort-pulse X-ray sources---X-ray Free Electron Lasers

identical nano-scale particles. When combined with coherent diffractive
imaging, these objects can be imaged; however, as the resolution of the images

obtain and, during an X-ray pulse, the number of photons incident on the

lead to the eventual redefinition of the second in terms of an optical atomic

microwave transition between hyperfine levels in ground-state $^{133}$Cs, it is
necessary to measure the absolute frequency of candidate standards, which is
done by comparing against a primary cesium reference. A key verification of
this process can be achieved by performing a loop closure$-$comparing frequency
ratios derived from absolute frequency measurements against ratios determined
from direct optical comparisons. We measure the $^1$S$_0\!\rightarrow^3$P$_0$
transition of $^{171}$Yb by comparing the clock frequency to an international
frequency standard with the aid of a maser ensemble serving as a flywheel
oscillator. Our measurements consist of 79 separate runs spanning eight months,
and we determine the absolute frequency to be 518 295 836 590 863.71(11) Hz,
the uncertainty of which is equivalent to a fractional frequency of
$2.1\times10^{-16}$. This absolute frequency measurement, the most accurate
reported for any transition, allows us to close the Cs-Yb-Sr-Cs frequency
measurement loop at an uncertainty of $<$3$\times10^{-16}$, limited by the
current realization of the SI second. We use these measurements to tighten the
constraints on variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio, $\mu=m_e/m_p$.

Artificial Intelligence (AI). The high demand of computational resources
required by deep neural networks may be alleviated by approximate computing
techniques, and most notably reduced-precision arithmetic with coarsely
quantized numerical representations. In this context, Bonseyes comes in as an
initiative to enable stakeholders to bring AI to low-power and autonomous
environments such as: Automotive, Medical Healthcare and Consumer Electronics.
To achieve this, we introduce LPDNN, a framework for optimized deployment of
Deep Neural Networks on heterogeneous embedded devices. In this work, we detail
the quantization engine that is integrated in LPDNN. The engine depends on a
fine-grained workflow which enables a Neural Network Design Exploration and a
sensitivity analysis of each layer for quantization. We demonstrate the engine
with a case study on Alexnet and VGG16 for three different techniques for
direct quantization: standard fixed-point, dynamic fixed-point and k-means
clustering, and demonstrate the potential of the latter. We argue that using a
Gaussian quantizer with k-means clustering can achieve better performance than
linear quantizers. Without retraining, we achieve over 55.64\% saving for
weights' storage and 69.17\% for run-time memory accesses with less than 1\%

show that the spectrum of antisymmetric (acoustic) plasma excitations contains
two modes: a weakly damped mode below the gap $2\Delta$ and a strongly damped
mode above the gap. The lower mode can be interpreted as an analog of the
Carlson-Goldman mode. This mode has an acoustic dispersion relation at small

The damping rate of this mode strongly increases under increase of temperature.
Out-of-phase oscillations of two order parameters in two spin subsystems are
also considered. This part of the spectrum contains two more modes. One of them

diagrams in massless $\phi^{3}$ theory (and its close cousin, bi-adjoint
$\phi^{3}$ theory) a polytope known as the associahedron sits inside the
kinematic space and is the amplituhedron for the theory. Precisely as in the
case of amplituhedron, it was shown that scattering amplitude is nothing but
residue of the canonical form associated to the associahedron. Combinatorial
and geometric properties of associahedron naturally encode properties like
locality and unitarity of (tree level) scattering amplitudes. In this paper we
attempt to extend this program to planar amplitudes in massless $\phi^{4}$
theory. We show that tree-level planar amplitudes in this theory can be
obtained from geometry of objects known as the Stokes polytope which sits
naturally inside the kinematic space. As in the case of associahedron we show
that residues of the canonical form on these Stokes polytopes can be used to
compute scattering amplitudes for quartic interactions. However unlike
associahedron, Stokes polytope of a given dimension is not unique and as we
show, one must sum over all of them to obtain the complete scattering
amplitude. Not all Stokes polytopes contribute equally and we argue that the
corresponding weights depend on purely combinatorial properties of the Stokes
polytopes. As in the case of $\phi^{3}$ theory, we show how factorization of
Stokes polytope implies unitarity and locality of the amplitudes.

academia and industry. AVs are a complex system composed of many subsystems,
making them a typical target for attackers. Therefore, the firmware of the
different subsystems needs to be updated to the latest version by the
manufacturer to fix bugs and introduce new features, e.g., using security
patches. In this paper, we propose a distributed firmware update scheme for the
AVs' subsystems, leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology. A
consortium blockchain made of different AVs manufacturers is used to ensure the
authenticity and integrity of firmware updates. Instead of depending on
centralized third parties to distribute the new updates, we enable AVs, namely
distributors, to participate in the distribution process and we take advantage
of their mobility to guarantee high availability and fast delivery of the
updates. To incentivize AVs to distribute the updates, a reward system is
established that maintains a credit reputation for each distributor account in
the blockchain. A zero-knowledge proof protocol is used to exchange the update
in return for a proof of distribution in a trust-less environment. Moreover, we
use attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme to ensure that only authorized AVs
will be able to download and use a new update. Our analysis indicates that the
additional cryptography primitives and exchanged transactions do not affect the
operation of the AVs network. Also, our security analysis demonstrates that our
scheme is efficient and secure against different attacks.

leading to an apparently linear description of nonlinear dynamics in which the
flow is expressed as a superposition of fixed spatial structures with
exponential time dependence. Attempting a Koopman decomposition is simple in
practice due to a connection with Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). However,
there are non-trivial requirements for the Koopman decomposition and DMD to
overlap which mean it is often difficult to establish whether the latter is
truly approximating the former. Here, we focus on nonlinear systems containing
multiple simple invariant solutions where it is unclear how to construct a
consistent Koopman decomposition, or how DMD might be applied to locate these
solutions. First, we derive a Koopman decomposition for a heteroclinic
connection in a Stuart-Landau equation revealing two possible expansions. The
expansions are centred about the two fixed points of the equation and extend
beyond their linear subspaces before breaking down at a crossover point in
state space. Well-designed DMD can extract the two expansions provided that the
time window does not contain this crossover point. We then apply DMD to the
Navier-Stokes equations near to a heteroclinic connection in low-Reynolds
number ($Re=O(100)$) plane Couette flow where there are multiple simple
invariant solutions beyond the constant shear basic state. This reveals as many
different Koopman decompositions as simple invariant solutions present and
again indicates the existence of crossover points between the expansions in
state space. Again, DMD can extract these expansions only if it does not
include a crossover point.

$\beta$-ensembles. Among the results we obtain are the Gaussian fluctuations of
single eigenvalues for Wigner matrices (without an assumption of 4 matching
moments) and classical $\beta$-ensembles ($\beta=1, 2, 4$), Gaussian
fluctuations of the eigenvalue counting function, and an asymptotic expansion
up to order $o(N^{-1})$ for the expected value of eigenvalues in the bulk of
the spectrum. The latter result solves a conjecture of Tao and Vu.

delays to reconstruct the overall time trace of the process. As a consequence,
this approach is limited to the investigation of fully reversible phenomena. We
recently introduced an off-axis zone plate based X-ray streaking technique,
which overcomes this limitation by sampling the relaxation dynamics with a
single femtosecond X-ray pulse streaked over a picosecond long time window. In
this article we show that the X-ray absorption cross section can be employed as
the contrast mechanism in this novel technique. We show that changes of the
absorption cross section on the percent level can be resolved with this method.
To this end we measure the ultrafast magnetization dynamics in CoDy alloy

fluences, we demonstrate the routine applicability of this technique. Probing
in transmission the average magnetization dynamics of the entire film, our
experimental findings indicate that the demagnetization time is independent of
the specific infrared laser pump fluence. These results pave the way for the
investigation of irreversible phenomena in a wide variety of scientific areas.

matrix completion (Recht et al., 2010) are extensions of PCA to allow for
outliers and missing entries respectively. It is well-known that solving these
problems requires a low coherence between the low-rank matrix and the canonical
basis, since in the extreme cases -- when the low-rank matrix we wish to
recover is also sparse -- there is an inherent ambiguity. However, the
well-posedness issue in both problems is an even more fundamental one: in some
cases, both Robust PCA and matrix completion can fail to have any solutions at
due to the set of low-rank plus sparse matrices not being closed, which in turn
is equivalent to the notion of the matrix rigidity function not being lower
semicontinuous (Kumar et al., 2014). By constructing infinite families of
matrices, we derive bounds on the rank and sparsity such that the set of
low-rank plus sparse matrices is not closed. We also demonstrate numerically
that a wide range of non-convex algorithms for both Robust PCA and matrix
completion have diverging components when applied to our constructed matrices.
An analogy can be drawn to the case of sets of higher order tensors not being
closed under canonical polyadic (CP) tensor rank, rendering the best low-rank
tensor approximation unsolvable (De Silva and Lim, 2008) and hence encourage
the use of multilinear tensor rank (De Lathauwer, 2000).

relatively long orbital period and the proximity of Barnard's Star to the Sun
raises the question whether the true mass of the planet can be constrained by
accurate astrometric measurements. By combining the assumption of an isotropic

find a probability of $\sim$10% to detect the astrometric signature of

would place the planet in the super-Earth mass range. In the next decade,
observations with the Wide-Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST) may increase
the prospects of measuring the true mass of the planet to $\sim$99%.

a popular approach to construct feature vectors of vertices. Due to the curse
of dimensionality and sparsity in graphical datasets, this approach has become
indispensable for machine learning tasks over large networks. The majority of
existing literature has considered this technique under the assumption that the
network is static. However, networks in many applications, nodes and edges
accrue to a growing network as a streaming. A small number of very recent
results have addressed the problem of embedding for dynamic networks. However,
they either rely on knowledge of vertex attributes, suffer high-time complexity
or need to be re-trained without closed-form expression. Thus the approach of
adapting the existing methods to the streaming environment faces non-trivial
technical challenges.
  These challenges motivate developing new approaches to the problems of
streaming network embedding. In this paper, We propose a new framework that is
able to generate latent features for new vertices with high efficiency and low
complexity under specified iteration rounds. We formulate a constrained
optimization problem for the modification of the representation resulting from
a stream arrival. We show this problem has no closed-form solution and instead
develop an online approximation solution. Our solution follows three steps: (1)
identify vertices affected by new vertices, (2) generate latent features for
new vertices, and (3) update the latent features of the most affected vertices.
The generated representations are provably feasible and not far from the
optimal ones in terms of expectation. Multi-class classification and clustering
on five real-world networks demonstrate that our model can efficiently update
vertex representations and simultaneously achieve comparable or even better
performance.

converging on the idea that ionization-driven chemistry depletes carbon
monoxide in T-Tauri disks. Yet the extent of CO depletion depends on the
incident flux of ionizing radiation, and some T-Tauri stars may have winds
strong enough to shield their disks from cosmic rays. There is also a range of
X-ray luminosities possible for a given stellar mass. Here we use a suite of
chemical models, each with a different incident X-ray or cosmic-ray flux, to
assess whether CO depletion is a typical outcome for T-Tauri disks. We find
that CO dissociation in the outer disk is a robust result for realistic
ionization rates, with abundance reductions between 70% and 99.99% over 2 Myr
of evolution. Furthermore, after the initial dissociation epoch, the inner disk
shows some recovery of the CO abundance from CO2 dissociation. In highly
ionized disks, CO recovery in the inner disk combined with depletion in the
outer disk creates a centrally peaked CO abundance distribution. The emitting
area in rare CO isotopologues may be an indirect ionization indicator: in a
cluster of disks with similar ages, those with the most compact CO isotopologue
emission see the highest ionization rates.

necessarily transonic. Since the electrons are responsible for radiative
cooling via processes like synchrotron, bremsstrahlung and inverse-Compton,
therefore the electron gas and proton gas are supposed to settle into two
separate temperature distribution. But the problem with two-temperature flow is
that, there is one more variable than the number of equations. Accretion flow
in its simplest form is radial, which has two constants of motion. While, the
flow variables are, the radial bulk three-velocity, electron and proton
temperatures. Therefore, unlike single temperature flow, in the two temperature
regime, there are multiple transonic solutions, non-unique for any given set of
constants of motion with a large variation in sonic points. We invoked the
second law of thermodynamics to find a possible way to break the degeneracy, by
showing only one of solutions among all possible, has maximum entropy and
therefore is the correct solution. By considering these correct solutions, we
showed that the accretion efficiency increase with the increase in the mass
accretion rate. We showed that radial flow onto super-massive black hole can
radiate with efficiency more than 10\%, if the accretion rate is more than 60\%
of the Eddington accretion rate, but accretion onto stellar-mass black hole
achieve the same efficiency, when it is close to the Eddington limit. We also
showed that, dissipative heat quantitatively affects the two temperature
solution. In presence of explicit heat processes the Coulomb coupling is weak.

building beyond the Standard Model. However, once coupled to gravity, any
scale-invariant microscopic model requires an explanation for the origin of the
Planck mass. In this paper, we provide a minimal example for such a mechanism
and show how the Planck mass can be dynamically generated in a strongly coupled
gauge sector. We consider the case of hidden SU(N_c) gauge interactions that
link the Planck mass to the condensation of a scalar bilinear operator that is
nonminimally coupled to curvature. The effective theory at energies below the
Planck mass contains two scalar fields: the pseudo-Nambu--Goldstone boson of
spontaneously broken scale invariance (the dilaton) and a gravitational scalar
degree of freedom that originates from the R^2 term in the effective action
(the scalaron). We compute the effective potential for the coupled
dilaton-scalaron system at one-loop order and demonstrate that it can be used
to successfully realize a stage of slow-roll inflation in the early Universe.
Remarkably enough, our predictions for the primordial scalar and tensor power
spectra interpolate between those of standard R^2 inflation and linear chaotic
inflation. For comparatively small gravitational couplings, we thus obtain a
spectral index n_s ~= 0.97 and a tensor-to-scalar ratio as large as r ~= 0.08.

nonlinearly-realized symmetries in cosmology. Utilizing the path integral, we
derive a generalized consistency relation that relates a squeezed $(N+1)$-point
correlation function to an $N$-point function, where the relevant soft mode is
at early rather than late time. This generalized (early-late-time) version has
wider applicability than the standard consistency relation where all modes are
evaluated at late times. We elucidate the conditions under which the latter
follows from the former. A key ingredient is the physical mode condition: that
the nonlinear part of the symmetry transformation must match the time
dependence of the dominant, long wavelength physical mode. This is closely
related to, but distinct from, the adiabatic mode condition. Our derivation
sheds light on a number of otherwise puzzling features of the standard
consistency relation: (1) the underlying nonlinearly-realized symmetries (such
as dilation and special conformal transformation SCT) originate as residual
gauge redundancies, yet the consistency relation has physical content---for
instance, it can be violated; (2) the standard consistency relation is known to
fail in ultra-slow-roll inflation, but since dilation and SCT remain good
symmetries, there should be a replacement for the standard relation; (3) in
large scale structure applications, it is known that the standard consistency
relation breaks down if the long wavelength power spectrum is too blue. The
early-late-time consistency relation helps address these puzzles. We introduce
a toy model where explicit checks of this generalized consistency relation are
simple to carry out. Our methodology can be adapted to cases where violations
of the standard consistency relation involve additional light degrees of
freedom beyond the inflaton.

clusters interact through the exchange of single monomers. The rate of exchange
is given by an interaction kernel $K$ which depends on the size of the two
interacting clusters. Well-posedness of the model is established for kernels
growing at most linearly and arbitrary initial data.
  The longtime behavior is established under a detailed balance condition on
the kernel. The total mass density $\varrho$, determined by the initial data,
acts as an order parameter, in which the system shows a phase transition. There
is a critical value $\varrho_c\in (0,\infty]$ characterized by the rate kernel.
For $\varrho \leq \varrho_c$, there exists a unique equilibrium state
$\omega^\varrho$ and the solution converges strongly to $\omega^\varrho$. If
$\varrho > \varrho_c$ the solution converges only weakly to
$\omega^{\varrho_c}$. In particular, the excess $\varrho - \varrho_c$ gets lost
due to the formation of larger and larger clusters. In this regard, the model
behaves similarly to the Becker-D\""oring equation.
  The main ingredient for the longtime behavior is the free energy acting as
Lyapunov function for the evolution. It is also the driving functional for a
gradient flow structure of the system under the detailed balance condition.

largest apparent motion of any known stellar object. It is the closest single
star to the Sun, second only to the alpha Centauri triple stellar system.
Barnard's star is also among the least magnetically active red dwarfs known and
has an estimated age older than our Solar System. Its properties have made it a
prime target for planet searches employing techniques such as radial velocity,
astrometry, and direct imaging, all with different sensitivity limits but
ultimately leading to disproved or null results. Here we report that the
combination of numerous measurements from high-precision radial velocity
instruments reveals the presence of a low-amplitude but significant periodic
signal at 233 days. Independent photometric and spectroscopic monitoring, as
well as the analysis of instrumental systematic effects, show that this signal
is best explained as arising from a planetary companion. The candidate planet
around Barnard's star is a cold super-Earth with a minimum mass of 3.2 Earth
masses orbiting near its snow-line. The combination of all radial velocity
datasets spanning 20 years additionally reveals a long-term modulation that
could arise from a magnetic activity cycle or from a more distant planetary
object. Because of its proximity to the Sun, the proposed planet has a maximum

over sample spaces with unbounded dimensionality, which constitute programmatic
analogues to Bayesian nonparametrics. Owing to the generality of this model
class, inference relies on `black-box' Monte Carlo methods that are often not
able to take advantage of conditional independence and exchangeability, which
have historically been the cornerstones of efficient inference. We here seek to
develop a `middle ground' between probabilistic models with fully dynamic and
fully static computation graphs. To this end, we introduce a combinator library
for the Probabilistic Torch framework. Combinators are functions that accept
models and return transformed models. We assume that models are dynamic, but
that model composition is static, in the sense that combinator application
takes place prior to evaluating the model on data. Combinators provide
primitives for both model and inference composition. Model combinators take the
form of classic functional programming constructs such as map and reduce. These
constructs define a computation graph at a coarsened level of representation,
in which nodes correspond to models, rather than individual variables.
Inference combinators implement operations such as importance resampling and
application of a transition kernel, which alter the evaluation strategy for a
model whilst preserving proper weighting. Owing to this property, models
defined using combinators can be trained using stochastic methods that optimize
either variational or wake-sleep style objectives. As a validation of this
principle, we use combinators to implement black box inference for hidden
Markov models.

detections in exoplanetary atmospheres. This approach involves monitoring
hundreds of molecular lines in the planetary spectrum doppler shifted by the
orbital motion of the planet. The molecules are detected by cross-correlating
the observed spectrum of the system with a model planetary spectrum. The method
has led to molecular detections of H2O, CO, and TiO in hot Jupiters using large
ground-based telescopes. Critical to this method, however, is the accurate
removal of the stellar and telluric features from the observed spectrum, also
known as detrending. Previous molecular detections have relied on specific
choices of detrending methods and parameters. However, the robustness of
molecular detections across the different choices has not been investigated in
detail. We conduct a systematic investigation of the effect of detrending
algorithms, parameters, and optimizations on chemical detections using
high-resolution spectroscopy. As a case study, we consider the hot Jupiter HD
189733 b. Using multiple methods, we confirm high-significance detections of
H2O (4.8$\sigma$) and CO (4.7$\sigma$). Additionally, we report evidence for
HCN at high significance (5.0$\sigma$). On the other hand, our results
highlight the need for improved metrics and extended observations for robust
confirmations of such detections. In particular, we show that detection
significances of $\gtrsim$ 4$\sigma$ can be obtained by optimizing detrending
at incorrect locations in the planetary velocity space; such false positives
can occur in nearly 30\% of cases. We discuss approaches to help distinguish

secular effect due to gravitational-wave radiation reaction. The spins of these
binaries, therefore, flip repeatedly as one of these special configurations is
entered. Binaries with total mass $M$, mass ratio $q$, and dimensionless spin
$\chi_1$ ($\chi_2$) of the more (less) massive black hole are allowed to
undergo wide nutation at binary separations $r \leq r_{\rm wide} \equiv [(q
\chi_2 - \chi_1)/(1-q)]^2 M$. Sources that are more likely to nutate widely
have similar masses and effective spins close to zero.

AGNs have SFRs that are more consistent with that of MS galaxies compared to
lower Lx AGNs. Despite this, the mean SFRs (as opposed to RMS) measured from
these distributions are consistent with the previously observed flat

at the orbital period. The detailed $\mathit{K2}$ light curve reveals that the
amplitude of the double-humps increases during the brightenings and that their

intervals. The $\mathit{HST}$ data unambiguously demonstrate that these
phenomena both arise from the heating and cooling of two relatively large
regions on the white dwarf. We suggest that the double-hump modulation is
related to spiral shocks in the accretion disc resulting in an enhanced
accretion rate heating two localised regions on the white dwarf, with the
structure of the shocks fixed in the binary frame explaining the period of the
double humps. The physical origin of the 8.5 h brightenings is less clear.
However, the correlation between the observed variations of the amplitude and
phase of the double-humps with the occurrence of the brightenings is supportive
of an origin in thermal instabilities in the accretion disc.

with average HI rotation curves for local systems, we investigate how the

higher surface density systems exhibiting flatter rotation curves. Drawing
comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations, we show that the average shapes of

and finite-temperature transitions of the anisotropic-exchange magnets on an
ideal nearest-neighbor triangular lattice. We investigate transitions between
five principal classical phases of the corresponding model: ferromagnetic,
N\'{e}el, its dual, and the two stripe phases. Transitions are identified by
the spin-wave instabilities and by the Luttinger-Tisza approach. Some of the
transitions are direct and others occur via intermediate phases with more
complicated forms of ordering. In a portion of the N\'{e}el phase, we find
spin-wave instabilities to a long-range spiral-like state. In the stripe
phases, quantum fluctuations are mostly negligible, leaving the ordered moment
nearly saturated even for the $S=1/2$ case. However, for a two-dimensional
surface of the full 3D parameter space, the spin-wave spectrum in one of the
stripe phases exhibits an enigmatic accidental degeneracy manifested by
pseudo-Goldstone modes. As a result, despite the nearly classical ground state,
the ordering transition temperature in a wide region of the phase diagram is
significantly suppressed from the mean-field expectation. We identify this
accidental degeneracy as due to an exact correspondence to an extended
Kitaev-Heisenberg model with emergent symmetries that naturally lead to the
pseudo-Goldstone modes. There are previously studied dualities within the
Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice that are exposed here in a
wider parameter space. One important implication of this correspondence for the
$S=1/2$ case is the existence of a region of the spin-liquid phase that is dual
to the spin-liquid phase discovered recently by us. We complement our studies
by the density-matrix renormalization group of the $S=1/2$ model to confirm
some of the duality relations and to verify the existence of the dual
spin-liquid phase.

The corresponding predictions depend only on two dimensionless parameters,
which characterize the curvature of the field--manifold and the leading order
behavior of the inflationary potential. For $\Lambda_0=0$ the scale symmetry is
unbroken and the dilaton admits only derivative couplings to matter, evading
all fifth force constraints. For $\Lambda_0\neq 0$ the field acquires a
run-away potential that can support a dark energy dominated era at late times.

data sets. The impact of possible consistency relations among the early and
late Universe dynamics that could appear within this setting is also discussed.

physical parameters for the SO$_2$ gas in the massive YSO MonR2 IRS3. This
yields a SO$_2$/$\mathrm{H}$ abundance lower limit of $5.6\pm0.5\times10^{-7}$,

have evaporated. This sublimation unlocks a volatile sulfur reservoir (e.g.,
sulfur allotropes as detected abundantly in comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko),

average temperature of the system in agreement with previous results. However,
we identify the cause of this mild dependence to be due to relaxed systems
only; disturbed systems do not show this trend, on average. The large scatter
observed in this relation is strongly associated with the dynamical state of
the systems: relaxed systems have on average a higher metallicity in the core
than disturbed objects. The radial profiles of relaxed systems are centrally
peaked and show a steep decrease with radius, flattening beyond
0.3-0.4R$_{500}$. The metallicity of disturbed systems is also higher in the
center but at much lower values than what is observed for relaxed objects. This
finding is consistent with the picture that cluster mergers mix the abundance
distribution by inducing large scale motions. The scatter of the radial
profiles is quite large, but while for relaxed systems it decreases almost
monotonically as function of the radius, for disturbed systems it shows a
significant boost at large radii. Systems with a central radio source have a
flatter profile indicating that central AGNs are an efficient mechanism to
uplift and redistribute the metals in the ICM.

of 12000, the atmosphere of SW Vir has been spatially resolved not only in
strong CO first overtone lines but also in weak molecular and atomic lines of
H2O, CN, HF, Ti, Fe, Mg, and Ca. Comparison with the MARCS photospheric models
reveals that the star appears larger than predicted by the hydrostatic models
not only in the CO lines but also even in the weak molecular and atomic lines.
We found that this is primarily due to the H2O lines (but also possibly due to
the HF and Ti lines) originating in the extended outer atmosphere. Although the
H2O lines manifest themselves very little in the spatially unresolved spectrum,
the individual rovibrational H2O lines from the outer atmosphere can be
identified in the spectro-interferometric data. Our modeling suggests an H2O

with stream predictions from models of the LMC/SMC interaction and infall into

last disk midplane passage. Most details of this idea remain a puzzle: the
Magellanic stream has low column density, the Milky Way disk at this large

cluster in the Milky Way halo presents an interesting opportunity for study.

analysis of astronomical data. However, since most ML algorithms are not
designed to take data uncertainties into account, ML based studies are mostly
restricted to data with high signal-to-noise ratio. Astronomical datasets of
such high-quality are uncommon. In this work we modify the long-established
Random Forest (RF) algorithm to take into account uncertainties in the
measurements (i.e., features) as well as in the assigned classes (i.e.,
labels). To do so, the Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF) algorithm treats the
features and labels as probability distribution functions, rather than
deterministic quantities. We perform a variety of experiments where we inject
different types of noise to a dataset, and compare the accuracy of the PRF to
that of RF. The PRF outperforms RF in all cases, with a moderate increase in
running time. We find an improvement in classification accuracy of up to 10% in
the case of noisy features, and up to 30% in the case of noisy labels. The PRF
accuracy decreased by less then 5% for a dataset with as many as 45%
misclassified objects, compared to a clean dataset. Apart from improving the
prediction accuracy in noisy datasets, the PRF naturally copes with missing
values in the data, and outperforms RF when applied to a dataset with different
noise characteristics in the training and test sets, suggesting that it can be
used for Transfer Learning.

computed from the linear response of the stress tensor. As an illustration we
compute it for a holographic CFT finding that at any temperature, and for any
perturbation, the free energy decreases. Similar behaviour was previously found
for free scalars and fermions, and for unitary CFTs at zero temperature,
suggesting (2+1)-QFT may generally energetically favour a crumpled spatial

expansion relative to the thermal scale. Then the free energy variation is
determined by a curvature correction to the stress tensor and for these
theories is negative for small curvature deformations of flat space.

the strip is closest to the line of sight. Across the strip, the integral leads
to a 1D Fourier transform. In the limit of narrow bandwidth and short
integration time, the integral reproduces the observed scintillation arcs and
secondary arclets. The set of scattered paths follows the pulsar as it moves.
Cohorts of noodles parallel to different axes produce multiple arcs, as often
observed. A single strip canted with respect to the rest produces features off
the main arc. I present calculations for unrestricted frequency ranges and
integration times; behavior of the arcs matches that observed, and can blur the
arcs. Physically, the noodles may correspond to filaments or sheets of over- or
under-dense plasma, with a normal perpendicular to the line of sight. The

residents suspect that the cancer cases could be caused by a known source of
hazard. In response, the CDC recommends that departments of health perform a
standardized incidence ratio (SIR) analysis to determine whether the observed
cancer incidence is higher than expected. This approach has several limitations
that are well documented in the literature. In this paper we propose a novel
causal inference approach to cancer cluster investigations, rooted in the
potential outcomes framework. Assuming that a source of hazard representing a
potential cause of increased cancer rates in the community is identified a
priori, we introduce a new estimand called the causal SIR (cSIR). The cSIR is a
ratio defined as the expected cancer incidence in the exposed population
divided by the expected cancer incidence under the (counterfactual) scenario of
no exposure. To estimate the cSIR we need to overcome two main challenges: 1)
identify unexposed populations that are as similar as possible to the exposed
one to inform estimation under the counterfactual scenario of no exposure, and
2) make inference on cancer incidence in these unexposed populations using
publicly available data that are often available at a much higher level of
spatial aggregation than what is desired. We overcome the first challenge by
relying on matching. We overcome the second challenge by developing a Bayesian
hierarchical model that borrows information from other sources to impute cancer
incidence at the desired finer level of spatial aggregation. We apply our
proposed approach to determine whether trichloroethylene vapor exposure has
caused increased cancer incidence in Endicott, NY.

reconstruction procedure which consists in looking for all tracks that
elementary particles leave when they pass through a detector among a huge
number of points, so-called hits, produced when flying particles fire detector
coordinate planes. Unfortunately, the tracking is seriously impeded by the
famous shortcoming of multiwired, strip and GEM detectors due to appearance in
them a lot of fake hits caused by extra spurious crossings of fired strips.
Since the number of those fakes is several orders of magnitude greater than for
true hits, one faces with the quite serious difficulty to unravel possible
track-candidates via true hits ignoring fakes. We introduce a renewed method
that is a significant improvement of our previous two-stage approach based on
hit preprocessing using directed K-d tree search followed a deep neural
classifier. We combine these two stages in one by applying recurrent neural
network that simultaneously determines whether a set of points belongs to a
true track or not and predicts where to look for the next point of track on the
next coordinate plane of the detector. We show that proposed deep network is
more accurate, faster and does not require any special preprocessing stage.
Preliminary results of our approach for simulated events of the BM@N GEM

we exploit the multi-functionality, post-fabrication reconfigurability, and
run-time polymorphism of spin-based devices, specifically the magneto-electric

camouflaging is shown to be resilient against state-of-the-art analytical

is not afforded in CMOS owing to fundamental differences in operation. For such
MESO-based camouflaging, we also anticipate massive savings in power,

energy-efficient electric-field driven reversal of the MESO device. Based on

of the measurement in the weak measurement regime and displays a singular,
extremely sensitive dependence for strong measurements. We finally relate this
behavior to that of the measurement disturbance defined in terms of the
fidelity between pre-measurement and post-measurement states.

further observe lifetimes under laser cooling of more than seven minutes, an
order of magnitude longer than in previous tweezer studies. Experiments are
performed with strontium atoms in $813.4~\text{nm}$ tweezer arrays, which is at
a magic wavelength for the clock transition. Tuning to this wavelength is
enabled by off-magic Sisyphus cooling on the intercombination line, which lets
us choose the tweezer wavelength almost arbitrarily. We find that a single not
retro-reflected cooling beam in the radial direction is sufficient for
mitigating recoil heating during imaging. Moreover, this cooling technique
yields temperatures below $5~\mu$K, as measured by release and recapture.
Finally, we demonstrate clock-state resolved detection with average survival
probability of $0.996(1)$ and average state detection fidelity of $0.981(1)$.
Our work paves the way for atom-by-atom assembly of large defect-free arrays of

mass, i.e. the mass-metallicity relation, but also to the star formation rate
(SFR) through the so-called fundamental metallicity relation (FMR); more active
galaxies show lower metallicities at fixed mass. Interestingly, high-z galaxies
up to z~2.5 follow the same relation defined by SDSS locally. However,
different shapes have been proposed for local galaxies, and the existence of a
FMR and the role of the SFR has been recently questioned by some authors. In
this paper we first discuss the various parametrizations of this
mass-metallicity-SFR relation that has appeared in the literature to understand
the origin of their different shapes. We then reanalysed data from CALIFA and
SDSS-IV MaNGA surveys, which were used to suggest no dependency of metallicity
on the SFR in local galaxies. Contrary to those claims, we find that those
datasets are instead fully consistent with the predictions, showing the
expected dependency on the SFR at fixed mass. Finally, we analysed those high-z
data whose consistency with the local relation was questioned. While an
internal dependency on the SFR among the subsamples is difficult to detect at
high-z because of the limited dynamic range sampled in the three parameters and
the intrinsic scatter and uncertainties of such small samples, all these
datasets are compatible with the relation defined locally by SDSS galaxies.
This confirms the lack of evolution of the FMR in these data up to z~2.3.

WASP-18b measured by the TESS Mission. The phase curve includes the transit,
secondary eclipse, and sinusoidal modulations across the orbital phase shaped
by the planet's atmospheric characteristics and the star-planet gravitational
interaction. We measure the beaming (Doppler boosting) and tidal ellipsoidal
distortion phase modulations and show that the amplitudes of both agree with
theoretical expectations. We find that the light from the planet's day-side
hemisphere occulted during secondary eclipse, with a relative brightness of
$341_{-18}^{+17}$ ppm, is dominated by thermal emission, leading to an upper
limit on the geometric albedo in the TESS band of 0.048 (2$\sigma$). We also
detect the phase modulation due to the planet's atmosphere longitudinal
brightness distribution. We find that its maximum is well-aligned with the
sub-stellar point, to within 2.9 deg (2$\sigma$). We do not detect light from
the planet's night-side hemisphere, with an upper limit of 43 ppm (2$\sigma$),
which is 13 % of the day-side brightness. The low albedo, lack of atmospheric
phase shift, and inefficient heat distribution from the day to night
hemispheres that we deduce from our analysis are consistent with theoretical
expectations and similar findings for other strongly irradiated gas giant
planets. This work demonstrates the potential of TESS data for studying full
orbital phase curves of transiting systems. Finally, we complement our study by
looking for transit timing variations (TTVs) in the TESS data and combined with
previously published transit times, although we do not find a statistically

these cascades is deflected by IGMFs, thereby reducing the observed point-like

potentially be detected with $\gamma$-ray telescopes (Fermi-LAT, HESS, CTA).

is split into two azimuthal angle bins: major axis ($\Phi<25^{\circ}$) and
minor axis ($\Phi>33^{\circ}$). OVI absorption along the galaxy major axis is
not correlated with galaxy rotation kinematics, with only 1/10 systems that
could be explained with rotation/accretion models. This is in contrast to
co-rotation commonly observed for MgII absorption. OVI along the minor axis
could be modeled by accelerating outflows but only for small opening angles,
while the majority of the OVI is decelerating. Along both axes, stacked OVI
profiles reside at the galaxy systemic velocity with the absorption kinematics
spanning the entire dynamical range of their galaxies. The OVI found in AMR
cosmological simulations exists within filaments and in halos of ~50 kpc
surrounding galaxies. Simulations show that major axis OVI gas inflows along
filaments and decelerates as it approaches the galaxy while increasing in its
level of co-rotation. Minor axis outflows in the simulations are effective
within 50-75 kpc beyond that they decelerate and fall back onto the galaxy.
Although the simulations show clear OVI kinematic signatures they are not
directly comparable to observations. When we compare kinematic signatures
integrated through the entire simulated galaxy halo we find that these
signatures are washed out due to full velocity distribution of OVI throughout
the halo. We conclude that OVI alone does not serve as a useful kinematic
indicator of gas accretion, outflows or star-formation and likely best probes
the halo virial temperature.

network will suffer from adversarial samples, or approximating the maximal
allowed scale of adversarial perturbation that can be endured. While most prior
work contributes to verifying feed-forward networks, little has been explored
for verifying recurrent networks. This is due to the existence of a more
rigorous constraint on the perturbation space for sequential data, and the lack
of a proper metric for measuring the perturbation. In this work, we address
these challenges by proposing a metric which measures the distance between
strings, and use deterministic finite automata (DFA) to represent a rigorous
oracle which examines if the generated adversarial samples violate certain
constraints on a perturbation. More specifically, we empirically show that
certain recurrent networks allow relatively stable DFA extraction. As such,
DFAs extracted from these recurrent networks can serve as a surrogate oracle
for when the ground truth DFA is unknown. We apply our verification mechanism
to several widely used recurrent networks on a set of the Tomita grammars. The
results demonstrate that only a few models remain robust against adversarial
samples. In addition, we show that for grammars with different levels of
complexity, there is also a difference in the difficulty of robust learning of

reliability theory and in risk analysis, where it is used to model the

induced by ""shocks"" that hit one or more components at a time. Of particular
interest is the L\'evy-frailty subfamily of the Marshall-Olkin (LFMO)
distribution, since it has few parameters and because the nontrivial dependency
structure is driven by an underlying L\'evy subordinator process. The main
contribution of our work is that we derive the precise asymptotic behavior of
the upper order statistics of the LFMO distribution. More specifically, we
consider a sequence of $n$ univariate random variables jointly distributed as a
multivariate LFMO distribution and analyze the order statistics of the sequence
as $n$ grows. Our main result states that if the underlying L\'evy subordinator
is in the normal domain of attraction of a stable distribution with index of
stability $\alpha$ then, after certain logarithmic centering and scaling, the
upper order statistics converge in distribution to a stable distribution if
$\alpha>1$ or a simple transformation of it if $\alpha\leq1$. Our result is
especially useful in network reliability and systemic risk, when modeling the
lifetimes of components in a system using the LFMO distribution, as it allows
to understand the behavior of systems that rely on its last working components.
Our result can also give easily computable confidence intervals for these
components, provided that a proper convergence analysis is carried out first.

clinical use is the need for automated quality control. As the scanners
sometimes determine focus inaccurately, the resultant image blur deteriorates
the scanned slide to the point of being unusable. Also, the scanned slide
images tend to be extremely large when scanned at greater or equal 20X image
resolution. Hence, for digital pathology to be clinically useful, it is
necessary to use computational tools to quickly and accurately quantify the
image focus quality and determine whether an image needs to be re-scanned. We
propose a no-reference focus quality assessment metric specifically for digital
pathology images, that operates by using a sum of even-derivative filter bases
to synthesize a human visual system-like kernel, which is modeled as the
inverse of the lens' point spread function. This kernel is then applied to a
digital pathology image to modify high-frequency image information deteriorated
by the scanner's optics and quantify the focus quality at the patch level. We
show in several experiments that our method correlates better with ground-truth
$z$-level data than other methods, and is more computationally efficient. We
also extend our method to generate a local slide-level focus quality heatmap,
which can be used for automated slide quality control, and demonstrate the
utility of our method for clinical scan quality control by comparison with
subjective slide quality scores.

correlations as a function of the signal to noise ratio and to define the
minimum bandwidth around the corner frequency for consistent parameter
resolution. As an application, we finally estimate the source parameters for

scaling between the seismic moment and the corner frequency holds, with an
average stress drop of $\Delta\sigma$ = 2.1 +- 0.3 MPa. However, the main

is unexpected from the lensing solution and has been interpreted as possible
evidence for secondary, small-scale lensing (millilensing) by a compact object
with a mass of $~10^5$-$10^7\ M_\odot$ located close to the curved image. The
probability for such a superposition is extremely low unless the millilens
population has very high surface number density. Here, we revisit the case for
millilensing in B1152+199 by combining new global-VLBI data at 8.4GHz with two
datasets from the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 5GHz (archival) and at 22GHz
(new dataset), and the previously published 5GHz Very Long Baseline Array
(VLBA) data.
  We find that the new data with a more circular synthesized beam, exhibits no
apparent milliarcsecond-scale curvature in image B. Various observations of the
object spanning $\sim$15 years apart enable us to improve the constraints on
lens system (thanks also to the improved astrometry resulting from 22GHz
observations) to the point that the only plausible explanation left for the
apparent curvature is the artifact due to the shape of the synthesized beam.

into solids, explaining the abundances of these species in comets and planetary

been used to estimate the abundances of each species in primitive ices after
they formed. However, these experiments have been carried out at deposition
rates which exceed those expected in a molecular cloud or solar nebula by many
orders of magnitude. Here we develop a numerical model which reproduces the
experimental results and apply it to those conditions expected in molecular
clouds and protoplanetary disks. We find that two regimes of ice trapping
exist: `burial trapping' where the ratio of trapped species to water in the ice
reflects that same ratio in the gas and `equilibrium trapping' where the ratio
in the ice depends only on the partial pressure of the trapped species in the
gas. The boundary between these two regimes is set by both the temperature and
rate of ice deposition. Such effects must be accounted for when determining the
source of trapped volatiles during planet formation.

Participants were initially unaware of the study. Experiment 1 claimed to bill
students; Experiment 2 enticed users with monetary rewards; and Experiment 3
threatened users with account cancellation. We found correlations resulting in
lowered susceptibility based on college affiliation, academic year progression,
cyber training, involvement in cyber clubs or cyber scholarship programs, time
spent on the computer, and age demographics. We found no significant
correlation between gender and susceptibility. Contrary to our expectations, we
observed greater user susceptibility with greater phishing knowledge and
awareness. Students who identified themselves as understanding the definition
of phishing had a higher susceptibility than did their peers who were merely
aware of phishing attacks, with both groups having a higher susceptibility than
those with no knowledge of phishing. Approximately 59% of subjects who opened
the phishing email clicked on its phishing link, and approximately 70% of those

(electrolyte gating) has recently been a topic of much interest. It is clear
that the metallization takes place electrochemically and there has previously
been extensive evidence for the removal of small amounts of oxygen during ionic
liquid gating. Hydrogen intercalation has also been proposed, but the source of
the hydrogen has remained unclear. In this work, solid-state magic angle
spinning NMR spectroscopy is used to investigate the thermal metal-insulator
transition in VO2, before progressing to catalytically hydrogenated and
electrochemically metallized VO2. Electrochemical metallization of bulk VO2
particles is shown to be associated with intercalation of hydrogen, the degree
of which can be measured with quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy. Possible
sources of the hydrogen are explored, and by using a selectively deuterated
ionic liquid, it is revealed that the hydrogenation is due to deprotonation of
the ionic liquid; specifically, for the commonly used dialkylimidazolium based
ionic liquids, it is the ""carbene"" proton that is responsible. Increasing the
temperature of the electrochemistry is shown to increase the degree of
hydrogenation, forming first a less hydrogenated metallic phase then a more
hydrogenated insulating Curie-Weiss paramagnetic phase, both of which were also
observed for catalytically hydrogenated VO2. The NMR results are supported by
magnetic susceptibility measurements, which corroborate the degree of Pauli and
Curie-Weiss paramagnetism. NMR spectroscopy is used to identify the presence of
hydrogen in an electrolyte gated thin film of VO2, suggesting that electrolyte
breakdown, proton intercalation and reactions with decomposition products
within the electrolyte should not be ignored when interpreting the electronic
and structural changes observed in electrochemical gating experiments.

selected using their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal. Recent measurements of the
splashback feature around optically selected galaxy clusters have found that
the splashback radius, $r_{\rm sp}$, is smaller than predicted by N-body
simulations. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that $r_{\rm sp}$
inferred from the observed radial distribution of galaxies is affected by
selection effects related to the optical cluster-finding algorithms. We test
this possibility by measuring the splashback feature in clusters selected via
the SZ effect in data from the South Pole Telescope SZ survey and the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter survey. The measurement is accomplished by
correlating these clusters with galaxies detected in the Dark Energy Survey
Year 3 data. The SZ observable used to select clusters in this analysis is
expected to have a tighter correlation with halo mass and to be more immune to
projection effects and aperture-induced biases than optically selected
clusters. We find that the measured $r_{\rm sp}$ for SZ-selected clusters is
consistent with the expectations from simulations, although the small number of
SZ-selected clusters makes a precise comparison difficult. In agreement with
previous work, when using optically selected redMaPPer clusters, $r_{\rm sp}$
is $\sim$ $2\sigma$ smaller than in the simulations. These results motivate
detailed investigations of selection biases in optically selected cluster
catalogs and exploration of the splashback feature around larger samples of
SZ-selected clusters. Additionally, we investigate trends in the galaxy profile
and splashback feature as a function of galaxy color, finding that blue
galaxies have profiles close to a power law with no discernible splashback
feature, which is consistent with them being on their first infall into the
cluster.

indicate that cylinder alignment orthogonal to substrate undulation is promoted
at low barrier height when substrate is preferential to minority block,
independent of barrier spacing. Commensurability is shown to play a limited
role in the assembly of orthogonal meshes. Parallel alignment is readily
achieved at larger barrier height, near condition of commensuration between

the existence of a well-defined expansion parameter, $k/k_{\rm NL}$, with

non-linearities in the system. Cosmologies beyond the {\Lambda}CDM model often
come with additional degree(s) of freedom. The scale $k_{\rm V}$ at which
non-linearities become important in the additional sector(s) can be rather
different from $k_{\rm NL}$. For theories endowed with a Vainshtein-type
screening mechanism, $k_{\rm V}$ sets the scale where screening becomes
efficient and restores continuity with the predictions of general relativity.
This is precisely the dynamics that allows such theories to pass existing
observational tests at scales where general relativity has been tested with
exquisite precision (e.g. solar system scales). We consider here the
mildly-non-linear scales of a dark matter component coupled to a galileon-type

identifying the geometrical arrangements of atoms in complex materials systems
are lacking. To address this challenge, we present a point-pattern matching
algorithm that can detect instances of a `template' structure in a given set of
atom coordinates. To our knowledge this is the first geometrical comparison
technique for atomistic configurations with very different number of atoms, and
when the optimal rotations and translations required to align the
configurations are unknown. The pattern matching algorithm can be combined with
an appropriate set of metrics to quantify the similarity or dissimilarity
between configurations of atoms. We demonstrate the unique capabilities of the
point-pattern matching algorithm using two examples where the automated
analysis of local atomistic structure can help advance the understanding of
structure-property relationships in material science: (a) identifying local
three-dimensional polyhedral units along interfacial defects, and (b) the
analysis of quasi-icosahedral topologies in the atomistic structure of metallic
glasses. We anticipate that the pattern matching algorithm will be applicable
in the analysis of atomistic structures in broad areas of condensed matter
systems, including biological molecules, polymers and disordered metallic
systems. An online implementation of the algorithm is provided via the open
source code hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/spatala/ppm3d).

multi-party transactions without the use of trusted intermediaries, which
currently underpin many commercial transactions. However, they do so by
transferring trust to computer systems, raising the question of whether code
can be trusted. Experience with high value losses resulting from incorrect code
has already shown that formal verification of smart contracts is likely to be
beneficial. This note investigates the specification and verification of a
simple form of multi-party transaction, atomic swaps. It is argued that logics
with the ability to express properties of strategies of players in a
multi-agent setting are conceptually useful for this purpose, although
ultimately, for our specific examples, the less expressive setting of temporal
logic suffices for verification of concrete implementations. This is
illustrated through a number of examples of the use of a model checker to
verify atomic swap smart contracts in on-chain and cross-chain settings.

inequality for independent, identically distributed random variables: Given a
sequence of random variables $X_1,\dots,X_n$ drawn independently from a
distribution $F$, the goal is to choose a stopping time $\tau$ so as to
maximize $\alpha$ such that for all distributions $F$ we have
$\mathbb{E}[X_\tau] \geq \alpha \cdot \mathbb{E}[\max_tX_t]$. What makes this
problem challenging is that the decision whether $\tau=t$ may only depend on
the values of the random variables $X_1,\dots,X_t$ and on the distribution $F$.
For quite some time the best known bound for the problem was
$\alpha\geq1-1/e\approx0.632$ [Hill and Kertz, 1982]. Only recently this bound
was improved by Abolhassani et al. [2017], and a tight bound of
$\alpha\approx0.745$ was obtained by Correa et al. [2017]. The case where $F$
is unknown, such that the decision whether $\tau=t$ may depend only on the
values of the first $t$ random variables but not on $F$, is equally well
motivated (e.g., [Azar et al., 2014]) but has received much less attention. A
straightforward guarantee for this case of $\alpha\geq1/e\approx0.368$ can be
derived from the solution to the secretary problem. Our main result is that
this bound is tight. Motivated by this impossibility result we investigate the
case where the stopping time may additionally depend on a limited number of
samples from~$F$. An extension of our main result shows that even with $o(n)$
samples $\alpha\leq 1/e$, so that the interesting case is the one with
$\Omega(n)$ samples. Here we show that $n$ samples allow for a significant
improvement over the secretary problem, while $O(n^2)$ samples are equivalent
to knowledge of the distribution: specifically, with $n$ samples
$\alpha\geq1-1/e\approx0.632$ and $\alpha\leq\ln(2)\approx0.693$, and with

its inability to learn in between scattering orders, and any Fourier domain
filtering is limited by the large number of filter parameters needed to get

learnable filters. The wavelet space allows us to have local, smooth filters
with far fewer parameters, and learnability can give us flexibility. We present

$k\in W^{m,1}\left( I\times I\right) $, $m$ is a positive integer with $m\geq

$L^{1}$-Carath\'{e}odory function.
  The existence of solutions for these Hammerstein equations is obtained by
fixed point index theory on new type of cones. Therefore some assumptions must
hold only for, at least, one of the derivatives of the kernel or, even, for the
kernel, on a subset of the domain. Assuming some asymptotic conditions on the
nonlinearity $f$, we get sufficient conditions for multiplicity of solutions.
  Two examples will illustrate the potentialities of the main results, namely
the fact that the kernel function and/or some derivatives may only be positive
on some subintervals, which can degenerate to a point. Moreover, an application
of our method to general Lidstone problems improves the existent results on the
literature in this field.

show that such strategies do exist. Under the conventional repeated public

wall. Specifically, the probability density $P(x)$ develops a power-law
singularity $P \sim x^\kappa$ with $\kappa < 0$ if the correlations are
positive (persistent) and $\kappa > 0$ if the correlations are negative
(antipersistent). We also analyze the behavior of the large-$x$ tail of the

the promising candidates for topological quantum computing. Recently, in
islands of nanowires, subgap-state energies have been experimentally observed
to oscillate as a function of the magnetic field, showing a signature of
overlapped Majorana bound states. However, the oscillation amplitude either
dies away after an overshoot or decays, sharply opposite to the theoretically
predicted enhanced oscillations for Majorana bound states. We reveal that a
steplike distribution of spin-orbit coupling in realistic devices can induce
the decaying Majorana oscillations, resulting from the coupling-induced energy
repulsion between the quasiparticle spectra on the two sides of the step. This
steplike spin-orbit coupling can also lead to decaying oscillations in the
spectrum of the Andreev bound states. For Coulomb-blockade peaks mediated by
the Majorana bound states, the peak spacings have been predicted to correlate
with peak heights by a $\pi/2$ phase shift, which was ambiguous in recent
experiments and may be explained by the steplike spin-orbit coupling. Our work
will inspire more works to reexamine effects of the nonuniform spin-orbit
coupling, which is generally present in experimental devices.

environment. The blockages have widespread consequences throughout the protocol
stack including beam tracking, link adaptation, cell selection, handover and
congestion control. Accurately modeling these blockage dynamics is therefore
critical for the development and evaluation of potential mmWave systems. In
this work, we present a novel spatial dynamic channel sounding system based on
phased array transmitters and receivers operating at 60 GHz. Importantly, the
sounder can measure multiple directions rapidly at high speed to provide
detailed spatial dynamic measurements of complex scenarios. The system is
demonstrated in an indoor home-entertainment type setting with multiple moving
blockers. Preliminary results are presented on analyzing this data with a
discussion of the open issues towards developing statistical dynamic models.

reduced by $60$ times in magnetic fields ($\vec{H}$'s), thus yielding the GMR
of about $-98\%$. The GMR changes systematically along with the Pn elements,
hinting that its origin is the spin orbit coupling (SOC) and/or $d$-$p$ orbital
hybridization. A positive MR component emerging on top of the negative GMR at
low temperatures suggests an orbital-sensitive magnetotransport as $\vec{H}$
suppresses the conduction of the electron-like carriers in the $d$-like band
but enhances those of hole-like ones in the $d$-$p$ hybridized band. The
anisotropy of the GMR reveals that the electrical conductivity is extremely
sensitive to the minute changes in the direction of the antiferromagnetic
moments induced by the parity-time breaking $\vec{H}$, which seems to be
associated with a magnetoelectric effect in the dynamic regime of conduction
electrons. We attribute the observed GMR to the non-trivial low energy band of
BMPn's, which is governed by the parity-time symmetry and an magnetic
hexadecapole ordering.

$p= c^2_s \rho$, and the 1st-order velocity is assumed to be curlless. We
analyze the solutions of 1st-order perturbations, upon which the solutions of
2nd-order perturbation are based. We show that the 1st-order tensor modes
propagate at the speed of light and are truly radiative, but the scalar and
vector modes do not. The 2nd-order perturbed Einstein equation contains various
couplings of 1st-order metric perturbations, and the scalar-scalar coupling is
considered in this paper. We decompose the 2nd-order Einstein equation into the
evolution equations of 2nd-order scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations, and
the energy and momentum constraints. The coupling terms and the stress tensor
of the fluid together serve as the effective source for the 2nd-order metric
perturbations. The equation of covariant conservation of stress tensor is also
needed to determine $\rho$ and $U^\mu$. By solving this set of equations up to
2nd order analytically, we obtain the 2nd-order integral solutions of all the

perform the residual gauge transformations between synchronous coordinates up

radiates jamming signals to confuse eavesdroppers when receiving the desired

assume the FD jamming receiver always improves the secrecy performance compared
with the half-duplex (HD) receiver, we show that this assumption highly depends

secrecy throughput. Most of the optimization operations are taken off-line and
only very limited on-line calculations are required to make the scheme with low

secrecy throughput is a quasi-concave function. Numerical results are
demonstrated to verify our theoretical findings, and to show its superiority

result, the observational spin parameter, $\lambda_R$, has become one of the
most popular methods of quantifying the relative importance of velocity
dispersion and rotation in supporting a galaxy's inner structure. The goal of
this paper is to examine the relationship between the observationally deduced
$\lambda_R$ and one of the most commonly used theoretical spin parameters in
the literature, the Bullock et al. (2001) $\lambda'$. Using a set of $N$-body
realisations of galaxies from which we construct mock IFS observations, we
measure $\lambda_R$ as an observer would, incorporating the effects of beam
smearing and seeing conditions. Assuming parameters typical of current IFS
surveys, we confirm that there are strong positive correlations between
$\lambda_R$ and measurement radius, and strong negative correlations between
$\lambda_R$ and size of the PSF, for late-type galaxies; these biases can be
reduced using a recently proposed empirical correction. Once observational
biases are corrected for, we find that $\lambda_R$ provides a good
approximation to $\sim \sqrt{3}/2 \; \lambda'(\rm R_{\rm eff})$, where
$\lambda'$ is evaluated for the galactic stellar component within 1 R$_{\rm

  Previous work in unsupervised image-to-depth learning has established strong

quality results, is able to model moving objects and is shown to transfer
across data domains, e.g. from outdoors to indoor scenes. The main idea is to
introduce geometric structure in the learning process, by modeling the scene

from monocular videos as input. Furthermore an online refinement method is
introduced to adapt learning on the fly to unknown domains.
  The proposed approach outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches, including
those that handle motion e.g. through learned flow. Our results are comparable
in quality to the ones which used stereo as supervision and significantly
improve depth prediction on scenes and datasets which contain a lot of object

factor of four. To address this controversy, and to connect the resolution to
the underlying physical processes, we build an independent simulation pipeline
for neutrino events in liquid argon, combining the public tools GENIE and
FLUKA. Using this pipeline, we first characterize the channels of
non-hermeticity of DUNE, including subthreshold particles, charge
recombination, and nuclear breakup. Particular attention is paid to the role of
neutrons, which are responsible for a large fraction of missing energy in all
channels. Next, we determine energy resolution, by quantifying event-to-event
stochastic fluctuations in missing energy. This is done for several sets of
assumptions about the reconstruction performance, including those available in
the literature. The resulting migration matrices, connecting true and
reconstructed neutrino energies, are presented. Finally, we quantify the impact
of different improvements on the experimental performance. For example, we show
that dropping particle identification information degrades the resolution by a
factor of two, while omitting charge deposits from de-excitation gammas worsens
it by about 25%. In the future, this framework can be used to assess the impact
of cross section uncertainties on the oscillation sensitivity.

be greatly enhanced with more loose cavity decay rate and is more resistant to

three-dimensional imaging of atomic lattice distortion fields within individual
crystallites in bulk polycrystalline materials through Bragg coherent
diffraction imaging (BCDI). However, the undersampling of the diffraction
signal due to Fourier space compression at high X-ray energies renders
conventional phase retrieval algorithms unsuitable for three-dimensional
reconstruction. To address this problem we utilize a phase retrieval method
with a Fourier constraint specifically tailored for undersampled diffraction
data measured with coarse-pitched detector pixels that bin the underlying
signal. With our approach, we show that it is possible to reconstruct
three-dimensional strained crystallites from an undersampled Bragg diffraction
data set subject to pixel-area integration without having to physically
upsample the diffraction signal. Using simulations and experimental results, we
demonstrate that explicit modeling of Fourier space compression during phase
retrieval provides a viable means by which to invert high-energy BCDI data,
which is otherwise intractable.

  conference on high energy physics, 4-11 July 2018",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph.CO hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent gamma-ray observations of TeV blazars exhibits the deficits of the
secondary GeV cascade photons. This suggests the existence of the intergalactic
magnetic fields, which may have a primordial origin. One of the mechanisms that
can produce primordial magnetic fields is so-called the chiral plasma
instability, where the (hyper) magnetic fields are destabilized when a large
chiral asymmetry exists in the high-temperature plasma in the early Universe.
We argue that such a large chiral asymmetry can be produced through the GUT
baryogenesis. Note that the chiral asymmetry is a good conserved quantity at
high temperature when the Yukawa interaction is weak enough. We also point out
that the generated hypermagnetic fields are maximally helical, and hence baryon
and lepton asymmetry is inevitably produced through the chiral anomaly in the
Standard Model through $U(1)_Y$ gauge interaction at the electroweak symmetry
breaking. Consequently, the magnetic fields suggested by the blazar
observations over-produce baryon asymmetry. Thus the chiral plasma instability
alone cannot be responsible for the intergalactic magnetic fields but can be
responsible for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In other words, GUT
baryogenesis without $B$-$L$ asymmetry generation is revived as a viable
baryogenesis scenario, which otherwise has been thought to suffer from $B$+$L$
washout by sphalerons. This presentation is based on the work [1].

broad applications in crime prevention, forensic identification and social

where a gait is regarded as a set consisting of independent frames. We propose
a new network named GaitSet to learn identity information from the set. Based
on the set perspective, our method is immune to permutation of frames, and can
naturally integrate frames from different videos which have been filmed under
different scenarios, such as diverse viewing angles, different clothes/carrying
conditions. Experiments show that under normal walking conditions, our
single-model method achieves an average rank-1 accuracy of 95.0% on the CASIA-B

represent new state-of-the-art recognition accuracy. On various complex

accuracies of 87.2% and 70.4% on CASIA-B under bag-carrying and coat-wearing

trained on labeled source data can be nicely transferred to the target domain.
This idea is certainly intuitive and powerful, however, limited theoretical
understandings have been developed to support its underpinning principle. In
this paper, we have provided a rigorous framework to explain why it is possible
to close the gap of the target and source domains in the joint space. More
specifically, we first study the loss incurred when performing transfer

explains and generalizes existing work in deep domain adaptation which was
mainly empirical. This enables us to further explain why closing the gap in the

result that characterizes a direct bound on the joint space and the gain of

massive Dirac fermion gas. This can be used as a simple model for gapped Dirac
materials. In the zero-mass limit, the case of gapless Dirac semimetals is also
studied. In the case of Weyl semimetals, to reproduce the nonsaturating linear
magnetoresistance seen in experiments, the use of screened charged impurities
is inevitable. In this paper, these are included using the first Born
approximation for the self-energy. The screening wave number is calculated
using the random phase approximation with the polarization function taking into
account the electron-electron interaction. The Hall conductivity is calculated
analytically in the case of no impurities and is shown to be perfectly
inversely proportional to the magnetic field. Thus the magnetic field
dependence of the magnetoresistance is mainly determined by $\sigma_{xx}$. We
show that in the extreme quantum limit at very high magnetic fields the gapped
Dirac materials are expected to have $\sigma_{xx}\propto B^{-3}$ leading to
$\varrho_{xx}\propto B^{-1}$, in contrast with the gapless case where
$\sigma_{xx}\propto B^{-1}$ and $\varrho_{xx}\propto B$. At lower fields, we
find that the effect of the mass term is negligible and in the region of the
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations the two systems behave almost identically. We
suggest a phenomenological scattering rate that is able to reproduce the linear
behavior at the oscillating region. We show that in the case of the scattering
rate calculated using the Born approximation, the strength of the relative
permittivity and the density of impurities affects the magnetic field

process within a femtosecond laser pulse in non-centrosymmetric materials.
Here, we report a new generation mechanism of terahertz lights based upon a
photoinduced phase transition (PIPT), in which an electronic structure is
rapidly changed by a photoirradiation. When a ferroelectric organic molecular
compound, tetrathiafulvalene-p-chloranil, is excited by a femtosecond laser
pulse, the ionic-to-neutral transition is driven and simultaneously a strong
terahertz radiation is produced. By analyzing the terahertz electric-field
waveforms and their dependence on the polarization direction of the incident
laser pulse, we demonstrate that the terahertz radiation originates from the
ultrafast decrease of the spontaneous polarization in the photoinduced
ionic-to-neutral transition. The efficiency of the observed terahertz radiation
via the PIPT mechanism is found to be much higher than that via the optical
rectification in the same material and in a typical terahertz emitter, ZnTe.

eruption upward. While the eruptive stage was studied in sufficient detail, a
quantitative theory of formation of the initial multi-ribbon structure remains
undeveloped until now. Aims: We construct a sufficiently simple but general
model of the magnetic field sources that is able to reproduce all the observed
types of luminous ribbons by varying only a single parameter. Methods: As a
working tool, we employed the Gorbachev-Kel'ner-Somov-Shvarts (GKSS) model of
the magnetic field, which was originally suggested about three decades ago to
explain fast ignition of the magnetic reconnection over considerable spatial
scales by tiny displacements of the magnetic sources. Quite unexpectedly, this
model turns out to be efficient for the description of generic multi-ribbon
structures in the anemone flares as well. Results: As follows from our
numerical simulation, displacement of a single magnetic source (sunspot) with
respect to three other sources results in a complex transformation from three
to four ribbons and then again to three ribbons, but with an absolutely
different arrangement. Such structures closely resemble the observed patterns
of emission in the anemone microflares.

measurement in a ground-based laboratory with existing techniques unfeasible.
Up until now, the cross-sections at lower energies can only be extrapolated
from the data at higher energies. However, two subthreshold resonances, located
at $E_x$ = 7.117 MeV and $E_x$ = 6.917 MeV, make this extrapolation more
complicated. In this work, the 6.917 MeV subthreshold resonance in the

via the

we derived the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) of the 6.917 MeV

which the reduced $\alpha$ width was computed to be $18.0\pm4.7$ keV at the

obtained in various direct and indirect measurements and presents an

equivalent to the equally famous suggestion of Thouless' that an integer number
of electrons are pumped between two ends of a one-dimensional quantum wire upon
sliding a charge-density wave over a single wave length. We use the
correspondence between these descriptions to visualise the detailed dynamics of
the electron flow during a single pumping cycle, which is difficult to do

its description. We find a close correspondence between topological edge states

community has been working on different techniques for Approximate Query
Processing (AQP) that aim to deliver an approximate query result given a fixed
time bound to support interactive visualizations better. However, classical AQP
approaches suffer from various problems that limit the applicability to support
the ad-hoc exploration of a new data set: (1) Classical AQP approaches that
perform online sampling can support ad-hoc exploration queries but yield low
quality if executed over rare subpopulations. (2) Classical AQP approaches that
rely on offline sampling can use some form of biased sampling to mitigate these
problems but require a priori knowledge of the workload, which is often not
realistic if users want to explore a new database. In this paper, we present a
new approach to AQP called Model-based AQP that leverages generative models
learned over the complete database to answer SQL queries at interactive speeds.
Different from classical AQP approaches, generative models allow us to compute
responses to ad-hoc queries and deliver high-quality estimates also over rare
subpopulations at the same time. In our experiments with real and synthetic
data sets, we show that Model-based AQP can in many scenarios return more
accurate results in a shorter runtime. Furthermore, we think that our

their model-free nature and convergence guarantees. These methods, however,
suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, resulting in poor sample
efficiency. To mitigate this issue, a number of variance-reduction approaches
have been proposed. Unfortunately, in the challenging problems with delayed
rewards, these approaches either bring a relatively modest improvement or do
reduce variance at expense of introducing a bias and undermining convergence.
The unbiased methods of gradient estimation, in general, only partially reduce
variance, without eliminating it completely even in the limit of exact
knowledge of the value functions and problem dynamics, as one might have
wished. In this work we propose an unbiased method that does completely
eliminate variance under some, commonly encountered, conditions. Of practical
interest is the limit of deterministic dynamics and small policy stochasticity.
In the case of a quadratic value function, as in linear quadratic Gaussian
models, the policy randomness need not be small. We use such a model to analyze
performance of the proposed variance-elimination approach and compare it with
standard variance-reduction methods. The core idea behind the approach is to
use control variates at all future times down the trajectory. We present both a
model-based and model-free formulations.

In this context, biomolecules have been modeled as Rouse chains in Gaussian

are non-Gaussian. This motivates us to take a Rouse chain subjected to a series
of pulses of force with finite duration, mimicking run and tumble motion of a
class of micro-organisms. Thus by construction, this active force is
non-Gaussian. Our analytical calculations show that the mean square
displacement (MSD) of center of mass (COM) grows faster and even shows
superdiffusive behavior at higher activity, supporting recent experimental
observation on active enzymes (A.-Y. Jee, Y.-K. Cho, S. Granick, and T. Tlusty,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 115, 10812 (2018)), but chain reconfiguration is slower.
The reconfiguration time of a chain with N monomers scales as N^sigma, where
the exponent sigma=2. In addition, the chain swells. We compare this
activity-induced swelling with that of a Rouse chain in a Gaussian active bath.
In principle, our predictions can be verified by future single molecule

predictions to the 12CO(1--0) and 13CO(1--0) velocity patterns. We also
examined the spatial distributions of Halpha, 857 GHz continuum, and HI
emission to search for evidence of large-scale external effects. We estimated
the depth of the cloud around the B211/B213 filament to be 0.3--0.7 pc under
the assumption that the density of the gas is the same as the 13CO critical
density. Compared to a linear extent of >10 pc in the plane of the sky, this
suggests that the 3D morphology of the cloud is sheet-like. 12CO and 13CO PV
diagrams perpendicular to the filament axis show that the emission from the gas
surrounding B211/B213 is redshifted to the northeast of the filament and
blueshifted to the southwest, respectively, and that the velocities of both
components approach the filament velocity as the line of sight approaches the
filament crest. The PV diagrams predicted by our accretion model are in good
agreement with the observed 12CO and 13CO PV diagrams, supporting the scenario
of mass accretion into the filament proposed by Palmeirim et al. Moreover,
inspection of the distribution of the Halpha and 857 GHz emission in the
Taurus-California-Perseus region suggests that the B211/B213 filament may have
formed as a result of an expanding supershell generated by the Per OB2
association. Based on these results, we propose a scenario in which the
B211/B213 filament was initially formed by large-scale compression of HI gas
and then is now growing in mass due to the gravitational accretion of ambient
cloud molecular gas.

a particular spatial discretization. We only require it to be inf-sup stable.
The convergence proof applies also to low-compressible or incompressible fluids

phylogenetic trees on the same set of $n$ leaves, defined as the number of
subsets of four leaves related by a different topology in both trees. After a
series of previous results, Brodal et al. [SODA 2013] presented an algorithm
that computes this number in $\mathcal{O}(nd\log n)$ time, where $d$ is the
maximum degree of a node. Our main contribution is a two-way reduction
establishing that the complexity of computing the quartet distance between two
trees on $n$ leaves is the same, up to polylogarithmic factors, as the
complexity of counting 4-cycles in an undirected simple graph with $m$ edges.
The latter problem has been extensively studied, and the fastest known
algorithm by Vassilevska Williams [SODA 2015] works in $\mathcal{O}(m^{1.48})$
time. In fact, even for the seemingly simpler problem of detecting a 4-cycle,
the best known algorithm works in $\mathcal{O}(m^{4/3})$ time, and a conjecture
of Yuster and Zwick implies that this might be optimal. In particular, an
almost-linear time for computing the quartet distance would imply a
surprisingly efficient algorithm for counting 4-cycles. In the other direction,
by plugging in the state-of-the-art algorithms for counting 4-cycles, our
reduction allows us to significantly decrease the complexity of computing the
quartet distance. For trees with unbounded degrees we obtain an
$\mathcal{O}(n^{1.48})$ time algorithm, which is a substantial improvement on
the previous bound of $\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\log n)$. For trees with degrees
bounded by $d$, by analysing the reduction more carefully, we are able to
obtain an $\mathcal{\tilde O}(nd^{0.77})$ time algorithm, which is again a
nontrivial improvement on the previous bound of $\mathcal{O}(nd\log n)$.

the electric field--current density characteristics and a sheet current
approximation. First, the Maxwell equation in a helicoidal coordinate system is
derived to model a twisted SC tape, taking account of the response to the
perpendicular field component in the steady state. We show that a loosely
twisted tape can be viewed as the sum of a portion of tilted flat tapes of
infinite length by examining the perpendicular field distribution on a twisted
tape. The analytic formulae for both magnetization and loss power in the tilted
flat tape approximation are verified based on the analytic solution of the
reduced Maxwell equation in the loosely twisted tape limit of $L_{\rm
p}\rightarrow \infty$ with the twist pitch length $L_{\rm p}$. These analytic
formulae show that both magnetization and loss power decrease by a factor of
$B(1+1/2n,1/2)/\pi$ (where $B$ is the beta function) for an arbitrary power of
SC nonlinear resistivity $n$, compared with those in a flat tape of infinite
length. Finally, the effect of the field-angle dependence of the critical
current density $J_{\rm c}$ on the loss power is investigated, and we
demonstrate that it is possible to obtain an approximate estimate of the loss
power value via $J_{\rm c}$ in an applied magnetic field perpendicular to the

arbitrary number of users. Under the assumption of uncoded cache placement, the
work derives the exact optimal worst-case delay and DoF, for a broad range of
user-to-cache association profiles where each such profile describes how many
users are helped by each cache. This is achieved by presenting an
information-theoretic converse based on index coding that succinctly captures
the impact of the user-to-cache association, as well as by presenting a coded
caching scheme that optimally adapts to the association profile by exploiting
the benefits of encoding across users that share the same cache. The work
reveals a powerful interplay between shared caches and multiple
senders/antennas, where we can now draw the striking conclusion that, as long
as each cache serves at least $N_0$ users, adding a single degree of
cache-redundancy can yield a DoF increase equal to $N_0$, while at the same

the delivery time by a factor of $N_0$. Finally some conclusions are also drawn

two physically motivated models for the source spectrum: Non-thermal accretion
column emission modeled by a power law with high-energy exponential roll-off
(AC model) vs multicolor thermal emission from an optically thick accretion
envelope plus a hard power-law tail (MCAE model). We combine the findings of
our Bayesian analysis with qualitative physical considerations to evaluate the
suitability of each model.
  Results. The low-energy part (<2 keV) of the source spectrum is dominated by
non-pulsating, multicolor thermal emission. The (pulsating) high energy
continuum is more ambiguous. If modelled with the AC model a residual structure
is detected, that can be modeled using a broad Gaussian absorption line
centered at ~12 keV. However, the same residuals can be successfully modeled
using the MCAE model, without the need for the absorption-like feature. Model
comparison, using the Bayesian approach strongly indicates that the MCAE model
-- without the absorption line -- is the preferred model.
  Conclusions. All models considered strongly indicate the presence of an
accretion disk truncated at a large distance from the central object, as has
been recently suggested for a large fraction of both pulsating and
non-pulsating ULXs. The hard, pulsed emission is not described by a smooth
spectral continuum. If modelled by a broad Gaussian absorption line, the fit
residuals can be interpreted as a cyclotron scattering feature (CRSF)
compatible with a ~10^12 G magnetic field. However, the MCAE model describes
the spectral and temporal characteristics of the source emission, without the
need for an absorption feature and yields physically meaningful parameter
values. Therefore strong doubts are cast on the presence of a CRSF in NGC 300

Uspensky formulates three ""axioms"" called ""axiom of computation records"",
""axiom of programs'"" and ""arithmeticity axiom"". Then, using these axioms (more
precisely, two first ones) he proves basic results of the recursion theory.
These two axioms are true also for the class of functions that are partial
recursive relative to some fixed oracle set. Also this class is closed under
substitution, primitive recursion and minimization ($\mu$-operator); these
(intuitively obvious) closure properties are also used in the proofs. This
observation made by Uspensky explains why many theorems of recursion theory can
be relativized. It turns out that the reverse statement is also true: all
relativizable results follow from the first two axioms and closure properties.
Indeed, \emph{every class of partial functions that is closed under
substitution, primitive recursion and minimization that satisfies the first two
axioms is the class of functions that are partial recursive relative to some
oracle set $A$}. This is the main result of the present article.

Most
of the real world networks follow the heterogeneous structure and exhibit

hub nodes and the network capacity is curtailed by smaller degree nodes.
Therefore, we propose rewiring a fraction of links in the network, to improve
the network transport efficiency. In this paper, we discuss some efficient link
rewiring strategies and perform simulations on scale-free networks, confirming
the effectiveness of these strategies. The rewiring strategies actually reduce
the centrality of the nodes having higher betweenness centrality. After the

`therapy species', which is a population of heterogeneous elementary therapies,
and propose a way how to turn the toxicity of the elementary therapy into its
fitness in a way conforming to evolutionary causation. As a result, not only
the therapies govern the evolution of different cell phenotypes, but the cells'
resistances govern the evolution of the therapies as well. We illustrate the
approach by the minimalistic ad hoc evolutionary model. Its results indicate
that the resistant cells could bias the evolution towards more toxic elementary
therapies by inhibiting the less toxic ones. As the evolutionary causation of
cancer drug resistance has been intensively studied for a few decades, we refer
to cancer as a special case to illustrate purely theoretical analysis.

the RM of the hotspot increases in magnitude towards the leading edge, as well
as changing sign (compared to the rest of the lobe). The Faraday depolarization
is also ~3 times larger at the hotspot than elsewhere. A plausible explanation
for this is significant compression of ambient magnetised gas by the bow shock
produced by the advancing hotspot. The western FRI lobe also exhibits some
evidence of interaction with local magnetised gas, as a transverse band of high
RM coincides with a distinct bend in the lobe. Previous observations of NGC 612
revealed an HI bridge of tidal debris along the direction of the eastern lobe
towards the gas-rich companion NGC 619. We find no clear evidence that ionised
gas associated with this bridge is either mixing with or lies in the foreground

against the hotspot, and indicates that the tidal debris must lie mostly behind

constant proper $n$-acceleration and of vanishing $(n+1)$-acceleration. By
$n$-acceleration we essentially mean the higher order time derivatives of the
position vector of the trajectory of a point particle, adapted to Minkowski
spacetime or eventually to curved spacetime. The $2$-acceleration is known as
the Jerk, the $3$-acceleration as the Snap, etc. As for the concept of {\sl
proper} $n$-acceleration we give a specific definition involving the
instantaneous comoving frame of the observer and we discuss, in such framework,
the difficulties in finding a characterization of this notion as a Lorentz
invariant statement. We show how the Frenet-Serret formalism helps to address
the problem. In particular we find that our definition of an observer with
constant proper acceleration corresponds to the vanishing of the third
curvature invariant $\kappa_3$ (thus the motion is three dimensional in
Minkowski spacetime) together with the constancy of the first and second
curvature invariants and the restriction $\kappa_2 < \kappa_1$, the particular
case $\kappa_2=0$ being the one commonly referred to in the literature. We
generalize these concepts to curved spacetime, in which the notion of
trajectory in a plane is replaced by the vanishing of the second curvature
invariant $\kappa_2$. Under this condition, the concept of constant proper
$n$-acceleration coincides with that of the vanising of the
$(n+1)$-acceleration and is characterized by the fact that the first curvature
invariant $\kappa_1$ is a $(n-1)$-degree polynomial of proper time. We
illustrate some of our results with examples in Minkowski, de Sitter and
Schwarzschild spacetimes.

thirst of reinforcement learning algorithms for large amounts of real

resulting in biases for model-based policy evaluation and search. Instead of de
novo synthesis of data, here we assume logged, real experience and model
alternative outcomes of this experience under counterfactual actions, actions
that were not actually taken. Based on this, we propose the
Counterfactually-Guided Policy Search (CF-GPS) algorithm for learning policies
in POMDPs from off-policy experience. It leverages structural causal models for
counterfactual evaluation of arbitrary policies on individual off-policy
episodes. CF-GPS can improve on vanilla model-based RL algorithms by making use
of available logged data to de-bias model predictions. In contrast to
off-policy algorithms based on Importance Sampling which re-weight data, CF-GPS
leverages a model to explicitly consider alternative outcomes, allowing the
algorithm to make better use of experience data. We find empirically that these
advantages translate into improved policy evaluation and search results on a
non-trivial grid-world task. Finally, we show that CF-GPS generalizes the
previously proposed Guided Policy Search and that reparameterization-based
algorithms such Stochastic Value Gradient can be interpreted as counterfactual

disassortativity with its neighbors. Betweenness centrality (BC) plays an
important role to find the influential node and user's shortest route in the
network. As shortest route comprised of hub nodes and chances of congestion is
more on these nodes. Hence, BC-BC correlation is used to find user's route. A
connection between two hub nodes reduces the data forwarding capacity of
connecting link with higher probability. If a node shows disassortativity with

Furthermore, user's optimal data sending rate as well as critical packet

Volume Scenario in AdS space solely in terms of $R_{AdS}$, in a form suitable
for holographic analysis. This rewritten EFT takes a remarkably universal (and
previously unnoticed) form, which is uniquely determined in the large-volume
limit up to terms suppressed by $\mathcal{O} \left( 1/\ln R_{AdS} \right)$,
with no reference to any of the fluxes, brane or instanton configurations that
enter the microphysics of moduli stabilisation. The putative dual 3d CFT will
have two low-lying single trace scalars, an even-parity scalar $\Phi$ dual to
the volume modulus with $\Delta_{\Phi} = \frac{3}{2}\left( 1 + \sqrt{19}

`bootland' --- a map between swampland constraints on the AdS side and
bootstrap constraints on the CFT side. We motivate this with a discussion of
swampland quantum gravity constraints on the axion decay constant in the

nonlinear-optical mechanism that couples between two co-propagating optical

nonlinear wave mixing along optical fibers, which adds up with four-wave mixing
induced by the Kerr effect. In this work, we report the distributed mapping of
nonlinear wave mixing processes involving both mechanisms along standard
single-mode fiber, in analysis, simulation and experiment. Measurements are
based on a multi-tone, optical time-domain reflectometry setup, which is highly
frequency-selective. The results show that F-SBS leads to nonlinear wave mixing
processes that are more complex than those that are driven by the Kerr effect
alone. The dynamics are strongly dependent on the exact frequency detuning
between optical field components. When the detuning is chosen near an F-SBS
resonance, the process becomes asymmetric. Power is coupled from an
upper-frequency input pump wave to a lower-frequency one, and the amplification
of Stokes-wave sidebands is more pronounced than that of anti-Stokes-wave
sidebands. The results are applicable to a new class of distributed fiber-optic
sensors, based on F-SBS.

in micro- or nano-structured media. Demonstrations in bulk crystals required
cryogenic temperatures. In this work, stimulated emission of highly-coherent
acoustic waves is achieved in a commercially-available multi-core fiber, at
room temperature. The fiber is connected within an opto-electronic cavity loop.
Pump light in one core is driving acoustic waves via electrostriction, whereas
an optical probe wave at a different physical core undergoes photo-elastic
modulation by the stimulated acoustic waves. Coupling between pump and probe is
based entirely on inter-core, opto-mechanical cross-phase modulation: no direct
optical feedback is provided. Single-frequency mechanical oscillations at
hundreds of MHz frequencies are obtained, with side-mode suppression that is
better than 55 dB. A sharp threshold and rapid collapse of the linewidth above
threshold are observed. The linewidths of the acoustic oscillations are on the
order of 100 Hz, orders of magnitude narrower than those of the pump and probe
light sources. The relative Allan's deviation of the frequency is between 0.1-1
ppm. The frequency may be switched among several values by propagating the pump
or probe waves in different cores. The results may be used in sensing,
metrology and microwave-photonic information processing applications.

previously for multidimensional quantum dynamics of distinguishable particles
can be used to study indistinguishable bosons in the second quantisation
formalism. To prove its validity, the technique termed here coupled coherent
states for indistinguishable bosons (CCSB) is tested on two model problems. The
first is a system-bath problem consisting of a tunnelling mode coupled to a
harmonic bath, previously studied by CCS and other methods in distinguishable
representation in 20 dimensions. The harmonic bath is comprised of identical
oscillators, and may be second quantised for use with CCSB, so that this
problem may be thought of as a bosonic bath with an impurity. The
cross-correlation function for the dynamics of the system and Fourier transform
spectrum compare extremely well with a benchmark calculation, which none of the
prior methods of studying the problem achieved. The second model problem
involves 100 bosons in a shifted harmonic trap. Breathing oscillations in the

demonstrating the applicability of the method as a new formally exact way to

10^{14}$ GeV leaving only a pair of Higgs doublets, their superpartners
(Higgsinos) and a gauge singlet fermion (singlino) besides the standard model
fermions and gauge bosons at low energy. The Higgsino-singlino mixing induces
small splitting between the masses of electrically neutral components of
Higgsinos which otherwise remain almost degenerate in GUT scale supersymmetry.
The lightest combination of them provides a viable thermal dark matter if the
Higgsino mass scale is close to $1$ TeV. The small mass splitting induced by
singlino turns the neutral components of Higgsinos into pseudo-Dirac fermions
which successfully evade the constraints from the direct detection experiments
if the singlino mass is $\lesssim 10^8$ GeV. We analyse the constraints on the
effective framework, arising from the stability of electroweak vacuum, observed
mass and couplings of Higgs, and the limits on the masses of the other scalars,
by matching it with the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model at $M_S$.
It is found that the presence of singlino at intermediate scale significantly
improves the stability of electroweak vacuum and allows a stable or metastable
vacuum for almost all the values of $\tan\beta$ while the observed Higgs mass
together with the limit on the charged Higgs mass favours $\tan\beta \lesssim

allows us to gain net work from thermal energy, although this seems to be in
contradiction to the Second Law of thermodynamics. Any manipulation, however,
causes some memory records somewhere in the system's surroundings. To complete
the thermodynamic cycle, these records must be reset, which costs energy that
cancels the previous gain. The question is, what happens when this memory
(information) is recorded only in the work reservoir? Then it cannot be reset
because the record means nothing but the work gain itself (e.g., the result
position of a weight in the gravity field). Is this a violation of the Second
Law? To answer the question, we study in this theoretical work an exchange of
energy between a physical (possibly microscopic) system that is thermalized at
the beginning and another (possibly microscopic) system -- the work reservoir
-- during a deterministic process in an autonomous arrangement, including also
an auxiliary device controlling the process. This arrangement is suitable for
deriving some equalities which express the Second Law in a form incorporating
explicitly relevant memory records (and related information). We use these
equalities in studying a hypothetical process including many cycles in which
the only non-reset memory record is that in the work reservoir during each
cycle. The results show that either the work gain is canceled in following
cycles (and the work reservoir fluctuates and cannot accumulate energy), or
there exists an information flow from the system (an information engine), or
the system cannot work in an expected way for a purely dynamic reason (this
reveals a deeper connection of the studied questions with the concept of
adiabatic accessibility).

to analyze the reverberation mapping dataset of Mrk 142 observed in the first

using a damped random walk process, and BLR structure is delineated using a
flexible disk-like geometry, in which BLR clouds move around the central BH
with Keplerian orbits or inflow/outflow motion. The approach also includes the
possibilities of anisotropic emission of BLR clouds, non-linear response of the
line emission to the continuum, and different long-term trends in the continuum

that is apt for parallel computation and use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
technique to recover the parameters and uncertainties for the modeling,
including mass of the central BH. We apply three BLR models with different
prescriptions of BLR clouds distributions and find that the best model for
fitting the data of Mrk 142 is a two-zone BLR model, consistent with the
theoretical BLR model surrounding slim accretion disks. The best model yields a

hypothesized to be responsible of several visual processing mechanisms such as
brightness induction, chromatic induction, visual discomfort and bottom-up
visual attention (also named saliency). Many computational models have been
developed to independently predict these and other visual processes, but no
computational model has been able to reproduce all of them simultaneously. In
this work we show that a biologically plausible computational model of lateral
interactions of V1 is able to simultaneously predict saliency and all the
aforementioned visual processes. Our model's (NSWAM) architecture is based on
Pennachio's neurodynamic model of lateral connections of V1. It is defined as a
network of firing rate neurons, sensitive to visual features such as
brightness, color, orientation and scale. We tested NSWAM saliency predictions
using images from several eye tracking datasets. We show that accuracy of
predictions, using shuffled metrics, obtained by our architecture is similar to
other state-of-the-art computational methods, particularly with synthetic
images (CAT2000-Pattern & SID4VAM) which mainly contain low level features.
Moreover, we outperform other biologically-inspired saliency models that are
specifically designed to exclusively reproduce saliency. Hence, we show that
our biologically plausible model of lateral connections can simultaneously
explain different visual proceses present in V1 (without applying any type of
training or optimization and keeping the same parametrization for all the
visual processes). This can be useful for the definition of a unified
architecture of the primary visual cortex.

response times in parallel-server systems. The key feature in redundancy
scheduling is replication of a job upon arrival by dispatching replicas to
different servers. Redundant copies are abandoned as soon as the first of these
replicas finishes service. By creating multiple service opportunities,
redundancy scheduling increases the chance of a fast response from a server
that is quick to provide service, and mitigates the risk of a long delay
incurred when a single selected server turns out to be slow.
  The diversity enabled by redundant requests has been found to strongly
improve the response time performance, especially in case of highly variable
service requirements. Analytical results for redundancy scheduling are
unfortunately scarce however, and even the stability condition has largely
remained elusive so far, except for exponentially distributed service
requirements. In order to gain further insight in the role of the service
requirement distribution, we explore the behavior of redundancy scheduling for
scaled Bernoulli service requirements. We establish a sufficient stability
condition for generally distributed service requirements and we show that, for
scaled Bernoulli service requirements, this condition is also asymptotically
nearly necessary. This stability condition differs drastically from the
exponential case, indicating that the stability condition depends on the
service requirements in a sensitive and intricate manner.

this characterization hides the irreversible character of the dynamics as well

revealed to be an important concept for filling this gap since it vanishes
identically for equilibrium systems and is positive for the nonequilibrium
case. Based on distinct and general arguments, the characterization of phase
transitions in terms of the entropy production is presented. Analysis for
discontinuous and continuous phase transitions has been undertaken by taking
regular and complex topologies within the framework of mean field theory (MFT)

$Z_2$ (``up-down'') symmetry systems under the MFT is presented. Our main
result is that a given phase transition, whether continuous or discontinuous

an icon system, perhaps the simplest nonequilibrium model presenting an
order-disorder phase transition and spontaneous symmetry breaking: the majority
vote model. Our work paves the way to a systematic description and

hydrodynamic suction forces due to the liquid inertia are the most relevant
ones. Besides the force, we measure as well the acceleration at the center of
the plate and the time evolution of the wetted area. The results of this study
show that, at very early stages, the hydrodynamic force can be estimated by a
simple extension to the linear exit theory by Korobkin (2013), which
incorporates an added mass to the body dynamics. However, at longer times, the
measured acceleration decays even though the applied external force continues
to increase. Moreover, high-speed recordings of the disc displacement and the
radius of the wetted area reveal that the latter does not change before the
disc acceleration reaches its maximum value. We show in this paper that these
phenomena are caused by the elastic deflection of the disc during the initial
transient stage of water exit. We present a linearised model of water exit that

space is an exceptional model of mathematical physics. Even more so in the
planar limit, where the theory is believed to be integrable. In particular, the
tree-level scattering amplitudes were shown to be invariant under the Yangian
of the superconformal algebra psu(2,2|4). This infinite-dimensional symmetry is
a hallmark of integrability. In this dissertation we explore connections
between these amplitudes and integrable models. Our aim is to lay foundations
for an efficient integrability-based computation of amplitudes. To this end, we
characterize Yangian invariants within the quantum inverse scattering method,
which is an extensive toolbox for integrable spin chains. Making use of this
setup, we develop methods for the construction of Yangian invariants. We show
that the algebraic Bethe ansatz can be specialized to yield Yangian invariants
for u(2). Our approach also allows to interpret these Yangian invariants as
partition functions of vertex models. What is more, we establish a unitary
Gra{\ss}mannian matrix model for the construction of u(p,q|m) Yangian
invariants with oscillator representations. In a special case our formula
reduces to the Brezin-Gross-Witten model. We apply an integral transformation
due to Bargmann to our unitary Gra{\ss}mannian matrix model, which turns the
oscillators into spinor helicity-like variables. Thereby we are led to a
refined version of the Gra{\ss}mannian integral formula for certain amplitudes.
The most decisive differences are that we work in Minkowski signature and that
the integration contour is fixed to be a unitary group manifold. We compare
Yangian invariants defined by our integral to amplitudes and recently
introduced deformations thereof.

geometrically induced error from grid Jacobian and metrics evaluation can
pollute the flow field, and degrade the accuracy or cause the simulation
failure even when uniform flow imposed, i.e. free-stream preserving problem. In
order to address this issue, a method for general linear-upwind and WENO
schemes preserving free-stream on stationary curvilinear grids is proposed.
Following Lax-Friedrichs splitting, this method rewrites the numerical flux
into a central term, which achieves free-stream preserving by using symmetrical
conservative metric method, and a numerical dissipative term with a local
difference form of conservative variables for neighboring grid-point pairs. In
order to achieve free-stream preservation for the latter term, the local
difference are modified to share the same Jacobian and metric terms evaluated
by high order schemes. In addition, a simple hybrid scheme switching between
linear-upwind and WENO schemes is proposed of improving computational
efficiency and reducing numerical dissipation. A number of testing cases
including free-stream, isentropic vortex convection, double Mach reflection and
flow past a cylinder are computed to verify the effectiveness of this method.

careful attention should be paid when making this association since the

impedances using basic circuit laws, a unified reference has to be defined.

the Impedance Operator (IO) and associated properties to the development of

time-discretization, we use the implicit Euler scheme. The second spatial
derivative of the temperature is a nonlinear function of the temperature and
the temperature gradient. We derive expressions for the partial derivatives of
this nonlinear function. They are needed for the implementation of the Newton
method. Then, we apply the finite difference method and solve the obtained
nonlinear systems by Newton method. The approach is tested on real physical
data for the dependence of the thermal conductivity on temperature in
semiconductors. A MATLAB code is presented.

to the solution of the Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko (GLM) integral equations with
a kernel that is bandlimited. By adopting a sampling theory approach to the
associated Hankel operators in the Bernstein spaces, a constructive proof of
existence of a solution of the GLM equations is obtained under various
restrictions on the nonlinear impulse response (NIR). The formalism developed
in this article also lends itself well to numerical computations yielding
algorithms that are shown to have algebraic rates of convergence. In
particular, the use Whittaker-Kotelnikov-Shannon sampling series yields an
algorithm that converges as $\mathscr{O}\left(N^{-1/2}\right)$ whereas the use
of Helms and Thomas (HT) version of the sampling expansion yields an algorithm
that converges as $\mathscr{O}\left(N^{-m-1/2}\right)$ for any $m>0$ provided
the regularity conditions are fulfilled. The complexity of the algorithms
depend on the linear solver used. The use of conjugate-gradient (CG) method
yields an algorithm of complexity $\mathscr{O}\left(N_{\text{iter.}}N^2\right)$
per sample of the signal where $N$ is the number of sampling basis functions
used and $N_{\text{iter.}}$ is the number of CG iterations involved. The HT
version of the sampling expansions facilitates the development of algorithms of
complexity $\mathscr{O}\left(N_{\text{iter.}}N\log N\right)$ (per sample of the

methodology, has traditionally been carried out under the assumption of
complete observation of the constituent series of curves, assumed stationary.
Nevertheless, as is often the case with independent functional data, it may
well happen that the data available to the analyst are not the actual sequence
of curves, but relatively few and noisy measurements per curve, potentially at
different locations in each curve's domain. Under this sparse sampling regime,
neither the established estimators of the time series' dynamics, nor their
corresponding theoretical analysis will apply. The subject of this paper is to
tackle the problem of estimating the dynamics and of recovering the latent
process of smooth curves in the sparse regime. Assuming smoothness of the
latent curves, we construct a consistent nonparametric estimator of the series'
spectral density operator and use it develop a frequency-domain recovery
approach, that predicts the latent curve at a given time by borrowing strength
from the (estimated) dynamic correlations in the series across time. Further to
predicting the latent curves from their noisy point samples, the method fills
in gaps in the sequence (curves nowhere sampled), denoises the data, and serves
as a basis for forecasting. Means of providing corresponding confidence bands
are also investigated. A simulation study interestingly suggests that sparse
observation for a longer time period, may be provide better performance than
dense observation for a shorter period, in the presence of smoothness. The
methodology is further illustrated by application to an environmental data set
on fair-weather atmospheric electricity, which naturally leads to a sparse
functional time-series.

systems formed by a solar-like star and a close-in planet. We focus on the
stellar wind spinning down the star along its main sequence phase and tidal
interaction causing orbital evolution of the systems. Despite recent
significant advances in these fields, all current models use parametric
descriptions to study at least one of these effects. Our objective is to
introduce simultaneously ab-initio prescriptions of the tidal and braking
torques, so as to improve our understanding of the underlying physics. We
develop a 1D numerical model of coplanar circular star-planet systems taking
into account stellar structural changes, wind braking and tidal interaction and
implement it in a code called ESPEM. We follow the secular evolution of the
stellar rotation assuming a bi-layer internal structure, and of the semi-major
axis of the orbit. After comparing our predictions to recent observations and
models, we perform tests to emphasize the contribution of ab-initio
prescriptions. Our secular model of stellar wind braking reproduces well the
recent observations of stellar rotation in open clusters. Our results show that
a planet can affect the rotation of its host star and that the resulting
spin-up or spin-down depends on the orbital semi-major axis and on the joint
influence of magnetic and tidal effects. The ab-initio prescription for tidal
dissipation that we used predicts fast outward migration of massive planet
orbiting fast-rotating young stars. Finally, we provide the reader with a
criterion based on the system's characteristics that allows us to assess
whether or not the planet will undergo orbital decay due to tidal interaction.

morphisms of motivic dga's is a certain limit of such spectra; we give an
explicit formula for this limit --- a possible first step towards explicit
computations or dimension bounds. We also consider commutative comonoids in
Chow motives, which we call ``motivic Chow coalgebras''. We discuss the
relationship between motivic Chow coalgebras and motivic dga's of smooth proper
schemes.
  As a small first application of our results, we show that among schemes which
are finite \'etale over a number field, morphisms of associated motivic dga's
are no different than morphisms of schemes. This may be regarded as a small
consequence of a plausible generalization of Kim's relative unipotent section
conjecture, hence as an ounce of evidence for the latter.

approximation (LDA) and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof implementation of the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Both functionals are shown to give
results in good agreement with experimental measurements. Such a consistency
between the two functionals may seem a bit surprising, as the LDA is known to
overbind and the GGA to soften the interatomic bonds. Such features ought to
greatly affect the value of the system interatomic force constants (IFCs) which
are necessary for the first-principle prediction of the lattice thermal
conductivity. In this study we show that the errors introduced by such
approximations tend to cancel themselves. In the case of LDA, the overbinding
generates larger absolute third-order IFCs, which tend to increase the
three-phonon scattering rates. On the other hand, larger absolute second-order
IFCs lead to a a larger acoustic-optical phonon band gap which in turns
decrease the available phase space for three-phonon scattering, compensating
the increase in the scattering rates due to stiffer IFCs.

compact objects for which SPI provides spectral information of prime interest.
Recently, two transient sources reached very unusual flux levels and have been
detected up to a few hundreds of keV with a high significance level. A drastic
reduction of the systematic errors is thus required to obtain reliable spectra.
This objective is achieved through an analysis including a detailed
understanding of the instrument behavior. This paper presents both aspects of
the data analysis: we first give a basic description of the instrumental
issues, then we present the solution to be implemented in the SPI data analysis
(at the event selection stage) and illustrate with a few examples the
reliability of the SPI results in the high-energy domain when the data analysis
is performed properly. We take benefit from this refined analysis procedure to

comes out as a result of its scattering with the particles of the plasma,
mediated by the exchange of Landau damped photons. In particular, we find that
the chiral imbalance is responsible for a different propagation of the left and

spontaneous radiation of energetic fermions is kinematically forbidden, and
discuss the time regime where our computation is valid.

reionization of the universe, is currently a hotly debated subject with
conflicting results. Studies of faint, high-redshift star-forming galaxies, in
most cases, fail to detect enough escaping ionizing radiation to sustain the
process. Recently, the capacity of bright quasi-stellar objects to ionize their
surrounding medium has been confirmed also for faint active galactic nuclei
(AGNs), which were found to display an escaping fraction of ~74% at z~4. Such
levels of escaping radiation could sustain the required UV background, given
the number density of faint AGNs is adequate. Thus, it is mandatory to
accurately measure the luminosity function of faint AGNs (L~L*) in the same
redshift range. For this reason we have conducted a spectroscopic survey, using
the wide field spectrograph IMACS at the 6.5m Baade Telescope, to determine the
nature of our sample of faint AGN candidates in the COSMOS field. This sample
was assembled using photometric redshifts, color, and X-ray information. We
ended up with 16 spectroscopically confirmed AGNs at 3.6<z<4.2 down to a
magnitude of i$_{AB}$=23.0 for an area of 1.73 deg$^{2}$. This leads to an AGN
space density of ~1.6$\times10^{-6} Mpc^{-3}$ (corrected) at z~4 for an
absolute magnitude of M$_{1450}$=-23.5. This is higher than previous
measurements and seems to indicate that AGNs could make a substantial
contribution to the ionizing background at z~4. Assuming that AGN physical
parameters remain unchanged at higher redshifts and fainter luminosities, these
sources could be regarded as the main drivers of cosmic reionization.

representation of environments with partial or noisy observations. In partially

state, a sufficient statistic of the observations seen so far. In this paper,
we investigate whether it is possible to learn such a belief representation
using modern neural architectures. Specifically, we focus on one-step frame

objective functions to learn the representations. To evaluate these learned
representations, we test how well they can predict various pieces of
information about the underlying state of the environment, e.g., position of
the agent in a 3D maze. We show that all three methods are able to learn belief
representations of the environment, they encode not only the state information,
but also its uncertainty, a crucial aspect of belief states. We also find that
for CPC multi-step predictions and action-conditioning are critical for
accurate belief representations in visually complex environments. The ability
of neural representations to capture the belief information has the potential
to spur new advances for learning and planning in partially observable domains,
where leveraging uncertainty is essential for optimal decision making.

the social-engineering campaigns of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks.
Behavioral decision theory fares better, but still falls short of capturing
social-engineering attack vectors, which operate through emotions and
peripheral-route persuasion. We introduce a generalized decision theory, under
which any decision will be made according to one of multiple coexisting choice
criteria. We denote the set of possible choice criteria by $\mathcal{C}$. Thus
the proposed model reduces to conventional Expected Utility theory when
$|\,\mathcal{C}_{\text{EU}}|=1$, whilst Dual-Process (thinking fast vs.
thinking slow) decision making corresponds to a model with
$|\,\mathcal{C}_{\text{DP}}|=2$. We consider a more general case with
$|\,\mathcal{C}|\geq 2$, which necessitates careful consideration of _how_, for
a particular choice-task instance, one criterion comes to prevail over others.
We operationalize this with a probability distribution that is conditional upon
traits of the decision maker as well as upon the context and the framing of
choice options. Whereas existing Signal Detection Theory (SDT) models of
phishing detection commingle the different peripheral-route persuasion
pathways, in the present descriptive generalization the different pathways are
explicitly identified and represented. A number of implications follow
immediately from this formulation, ranging from the conditional nature of
security-breach risk to delineation of the prerequisites for valid tests of
security training. Moreover, the model explains the `stepping-stone'
penetration pattern of APT attacks, which has confounded modeling approaches

population in Wisconsin based on age-at-harvest data and improves on previous
models by using little demographic data, no auxiliary data, and not being
sensitive to initial population size. The increased accuracy of the AAH
state-space models should allow for better management by being able to set
accurate quotas to ensure a sustainable harvest for the black bear population

bobcats in Wisconsin to determine trends in harvest, method, and hunter

computationally complex estimation procedures. In this paper, we present a

which situations such latecomers can enable gathering? To answer this question

density. Resulting superluminal oscillations of electric current in a
finite-size plasma channel radiate electromagnetic waves via the same mechanism

is prominent in the 4-6 keV range. Instead, two peaks of similar intensity,
separated by ~36 pc in projection on the plane of the sky are detected in the

heavily obscured hard continuum source. We discuss four possible
interpretations of the nuclear morphology. (1) Given the bolometric luminosity
and likely black hole (BH) mass of ESO 428-G014, we may be imaging two clumps
of the CT obscuring torus in the Fe K{\alpha} line. (2) The Fe K{\alpha} knots
may be connected with the fluorescent emission from the dusty bicone, or (3)
with the light echo of a nuclear outburst. (4) We also explore the less likely

11, natural) and their impact on thermal and charge transport characteristics
of the crystals have been first discovered. Atomic displacement parameters
(ADPs) of Lu and B atoms are described in terms of the Einstein and Debye
models, respectively. Characteristic Einstein and Debye temperatures are
calculated directly from the x-ray data and corresponding ADPs are separated
into temperature dependent and temperature independent components. The first
component is a measure of thermal atomic vibrations whereas the second one is a
sum of zero vibrations and static shifts of some atoms from their
crystallographic positions. Such a local disordering is more expressed in
LunatB12 with 10B : 11B = 1 : 4 judging both from the large static ADP
components and the Schottky anomalies in the heat capacity. Crystal structures
are refined in Fm3-m group but certain distortions of the ideal cubic unit-cell
values are observed in all three crystals under study due to cooperative
Jahn-Teller effect. The distortions are mainly trigonal or mainly tetragonal
depending on the isotope composition. Low symmetry distribution of electron
density reveals itself in LunatB12 in the form of the dynamic charge stripes
oriented in selected directions close to some of <110>. The large static ADP
components of LunatB12 are surprisingly combined with high conductivity of the
crystal. One may suppose the static shifts (defects) are centers of pinning
facilitating formation of additional conductive channels.

secretary ranking problem: elements from an ordered set arrive in random order
and instead of picking the maximum element, the algorithm is asked to assign a
rank, or position, to each of the elements. The rank assigned is irrevocable
and is given knowing only the pairwise comparisons with elements previously
arrived. The goal is to minimize the distance of the rank produced to the true
rank of the elements measured by the Kendall-Tau distance, which corresponds to
the number of pairs that are inverted with respect to the true order.
  Our main result is a matching upper and lower bound for the secretary ranking
problem. We present an algorithm that ranks $n$ elements with only $O(n^{3/2})$
inversions in expectation, and show that any algorithm necessarily suffers
$\Omega(n^{3/2})$ inversions when there are $n$ available positions. In terms
of techniques, the analysis of our algorithm draws connections to linear
probing in the hashing literature, while our lower bound result relies on a
general anti-concentration bound for a generic balls and bins sampling process.
We also consider the case where the number of positions $m$ can be larger than
the number of secretaries $n$ and provide an improved bound by showing a
connection of this problem with random binary trees.

  background material is covered in both papers",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Support vector data description (SVDD) is a popular anomaly detection
technique. The SVDD classifier partitions the whole data space into an inlier
region, which consists of the region near the training data, and an outlier
region, which consists of points away from the training data. The computation
of the SVDD classifier requires a kernel function, for which the Gaussian
kernel is a common choice. The Gaussian kernel has a bandwidth parameter, and
it is important to set the value of this parameter correctly for good results.
A small bandwidth leads to overfitting such that the resulting SVDD classifier
overestimates the number of anomalies, whereas a large bandwidth leads to
underfitting and an inability to detect many anomalies. In this paper, we
present a new unsupervised method for selecting the Gaussian kernel bandwidth.
Our method exploits a low-rank representation of the kernel matrix to suggest a
kernel bandwidth value. Our new technique is competitive with the current state
of the art for low-dimensional data and performs extremely well for many
classes of high-dimensional data. Because the mathematical formulation of SVDD
is identical with the mathematical formulation of one-class support vector
machines (OCSVM) when the Gaussian kernel is used, our method is equally
applicable to Gaussian kernel bandwidth tuning for OCSVM.

Recently, we demonstrated that linearly polarized driving pulses lead to

combination of intraband motion and interband transition [Higuchi $\textit{et
al.}$, Nature $\textbf{550}$, 224 (2017)]. Here we introduce a pulsed control
laser beam, orthogonally polarized to the driving pulses, and observe the
ensuing electron dynamics. The relative delay between the two pulses is a
tuning parameter to control the electron trajectory, now in a complex fashion
exploring the full two-dimensional reciprocal space in graphene. Depending on
the relative phase, the electron trajectory in the reciprocal space can, for
example, be deformed to suppress the quantum path interference resulting from
the driving laser pulse. Intriguingly, this strong-field-based complex matter
wave manipulation in a two-dimensional conductor is driven by a high repetition
rate \textit{laser oscillator}, rendering unnecessary complex and expensive
amplified laser systems.

the last decade in HPC has been the General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit
(GPGPU), a class of massively parallel devices that now contributes the
majority of computational power in the top 500 supercomputers. As these systems
grow, small costs such as latency---due to the fixed cost of memory accesses
and communication---accumulate in a large simulation and become a significant
barrier to performance. The swept time-space decomposition rule is a
communication-avoiding technique for time-stepping stencil update formulas that
attempts to reduce latency costs. This work extends the swept rule by targeting
heterogeneous, CPU/GPU architectures representing current and future HPC
systems. We compare our approach to a naive decomposition scheme with two test
equations using an MPI+CUDA pattern on 40 processes over two nodes containing
one GPU. The swept rule produces a factor of 1.9 to 23 speedup for the heat
equation and a factor of 1.1 to 2.0 speedup for the Euler equations, using the
same processors and work distribution, and with the best possible
configurations. These results show the potential effectiveness of the swept

to build predictive models that can leverage both these molecular

In this paper, we present an effective time-series segmentation technique that
extracts optimal time segments of individual's similar behavioral
characteristics utilizing their mobile phone data. One of the determinants of
an individual's behavior is the various activities undertaken at various
times-of-the-day and days-of-the-week. In many cases, such behavior will follow
temporal patterns. Currently, researchers use either equal or unequal
interval-based segmentation of time for mining mobile phone users' behavior.
Most of them take into account static temporal coverage of 24-h-a-day and few
of them take into account the number of incidences in time-series data.
However, such segmentations do not necessarily map to the patterns of
individual user activity and subsequent behavior because of not taking into
account the diverse behaviors of individuals over time-of-the-week. Therefore,
we propose a behavior-oriented time segmentation (BOTS) technique that takes
into account not only the temporal coverage of the week but also the number of
incidences of diverse behaviors dynamically for producing similar behavioral
time segments over the week utilizing time-series data. Experiments on the real
mobile phone datasets show that our proposed segmentation technique better
captures the user's dominant behavior at various times-of-the-day and
days-of-the-week enabling the generation of high confidence temporal rules in
order to mine individual mobile phone users' behavior.

hyperelasticity and the kinematics of the continuum is described by both a
position vector and by a remodelling tensor which, in the present context, is
an orthogonal tensor representing the fibre reorientation process. By imposing
suitable thermodynamical restrictions on the constitutive equation, we obtain
an evolution equation of the remodelling tensor governed by the Eshelby torque,
whose stationary solutions are studied in absence of any external source terms.
It is shown that the fibres reorient themselves in a configuration that
minimises the elastic energy and get aligned along a direction that may or may
not be of principal strain. The explicit analysis of the Hessian of the strain
energy density allows us to discriminate among the stationary solutions, which
ones are stable. Examples are given for passive reorientation processes driven

large device lengths limiting electro-optic performance. In contrast, here we
demonstrate a plasmonic slot graphene photodetector on silicon-on-insulator
platform with high-responsivity given the 5 um-short device length. We observe
that the maximum photocurrent, and hence the highest responsivity, scales
inversely with the slot gap width. Using a dual-lithography step, we realize 15
nm narrow slots that show a 15-times higher responsivity per unit device-length
compared to photonic graphene photodetectors. Furthermore, we reveal that the
back-gated electrostatics is overshadowed by channel-doping contributions
induced by the contacts of this ultra-short channel graphene photodetector.
This leads to quasi charge neutrality, which explains both the
previously-unseen offset between the maximum photovoltaic-based photocurrent
relative to graphenes Dirac point and the observed non-ambipolar transport.
Such micrometer compact and absorption-efficient photodetectors allow for
short-carrier pathways in next-generation photonic components, while being an
