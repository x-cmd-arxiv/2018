invariants for one-dimensional four-band insulators in AIII class whose
topological invariant is the winding number, and two-dimensional two-band
insulators in A class whose topological invariant is the Chern number. Given
Hamiltonians in the momentum space as the input, neural networks can predict
topological invariants for both classes with accuracy close to or higher than
90%, even for Hamiltonians whose invariants are beyond the training data set.
Despite the complexity of the neural network, we find that the output of
certain intermediate hidden layers resembles either the winding angle for
models in AIII class or the solid angle (Berry curvature) for models in A
class, indicating that neural networks essentially capture the mathematical
formula of topological invariants. Our work demonstrates the ability of neural
networks to predict topological invariants for complicated models with local
Hamiltonians as the only input, and offers an example that even a deep neural
network is understandable.

allows to study the electromagnetic excitation spectrum of the neutron and the
isospin structure of the excitation of nucleon resonances. The database for
such reactions is much more sparse than for free proton targets. Single $\pi^0$
photoproduction off quasi-free nucleons from the deuteron was experimentally
studied. Nuclear effects were investigated by a comparison of the results for
free protons and quasi-free protons and used as a correction for the quasi-free
neutron data. The experiment was performed at the tagged photon beam of the
Mainz MAMI accelerator for photon energies between 0.45~GeV and 1.4~GeV, using
an almost $4\pi$ electromagnetic calorimeter composed of the Crystal Ball and
TAPS detectors. A complete kinematic reconstruction of the final state removed
the effects of Fermi motion. Reaction model predictions and PWA for $\gamma
n\rightarrow n\pi^{0}$, based on fits to data for the other isospin channels,
disagreed between themselves and no model provided a good description of the
new data. The results demonstrate clearly the importance of a measurement of
the fully neutral final state for the isospin decomposition of the cross
section. Model refits, for example from the Bonn-Gatchina analysis, show that
the new and the previous data for the other three isospin channels can be
simultaneously described when the contributions of several partial waves are
modified. The results are also relevant for the suppression of the higher
resonance bumps in total photoabsorption on nuclei, which are not well
understood.

be correlated or controlled by an attacker, can be generated based on quantum
measurement of vacuum state and universal-hashing randomness extraction.
Quantum entropy in the measurements decides the quality and security of the
random number generator. At the same time, it directly determine the extraction
ratio of true randomness from the raw data, in other words, it affects quantum
random numbers generating rate obviously. In this work, considering the effects
of classical noise, the best way to enhance quantum entropy in the vacuum-based
quantum random number generator is explored in the optimum dynamical
analog-digital converter (ADC) range scenario. The influence of classical noise
excursion, which may be intrinsic to a system or deliberately induced by an
eavesdropper, on the quantum entropy is derived. We propose enhancing local
oscillator intensity rather than electrical gain for noise-independent
amplification of quadrature fluctuation of vacuum state. Abundant quantum
entropy is extractable from the raw data even when classical noise excursion is
large. Experimentally, an extraction ratio of true randomness of 85.3% is
achieved by finite enhancement of the local oscillator power when classical
noise excursions of the raw data is obvious.

discretisation of inviscid and viscous terms in energy stable discontinuous
Galerkin methods. First, we analyse these methods using a linear von Neumann
analysis (for a linear advection-diffusion equation) to characterise their
properties in wave-number space. Second, we validate these observations using
the 3D Taylor-Green Vortex Navier-Stokes problem to assess
transitional/turbulent flows. We show that the dissipation introduced by upwind
Riemann solvers affects primarily high wave-numbers. This dissipation may be
increased, through a penalty parameter, until a critical value. However,
further augmentation of this parameter leads to a decrease of dissipation,
reaching zero for very large values. Regarding the dissipation introduced by
second order derivatives, we show that this dissipa- tion acts at low and
medium wave-numbers (lower wave-numbers compared to upwind Riemann solvers). In
addition, we analyse the Spectral Vanishing Viscosity (SVV) technique,
previously used in continuous discretisations (e.g. Fourier), to find that with
an appropriate kernel (which damps selected modes) it is possible to control
the amount of dissipation introduced in the low and medium wave-number range.
Combining these ideas, we finally propose a DG-SVV approach that uses a
Smagorinsky model to compute the numerical viscosity. This DG-SVV approach is
tested in an isotropic laminar/turbulent under-resolved scenario. Combining the
SVV technique with a low dissipation Riemann solver, we obtain a scheme capable
of maintaining low dissipation levels for laminar flows, whilst providing the
correct dissipation for all wave-number ranges in turbulent regimes.

to compute the expected value of an n-authors publication that takes into
consideration the added value induced by collaboration in contexts in which
there is no prior or ex-ante information about the publication's potential
merits or scientific impact. The only information required is the number of
authors. We compared the obtained theoretical values with the empirical values
based on a large dataset from the Web of Science database. We found that the

but not for all. This observation provides support in favor of the method

to a bound on the mass of a hypothetical massive carrier of the gravitational

on radius (1-2 $R_{\bigoplus}$) and mass (< 10 $M_{\bigoplus}$). Here we model
mass-radius relations based on silicate mantle and iron core equations of state
to infer to first order the structure and composition range of rocky
super-Earths assuming insignificant gas envelopes. We develop a new equation of
state of hexagonal close packed (hcp) iron for super-Earth conditions (SEOS)
based on density functional theory results for pressures up to 137~TPa. A
comparison of SEOS and extrapolated equations of state for iron from the
literature reveals differences in density of up to 4% at 1~TPa and up to 20% at
10~TPa. Such density differences change the derived mass by up to 10\% for
Earth-like super-Earths (core radius fraction of 0.5) and 20% for Mercury-like
super-Earths (core radius fraction of 0.8). We find that the effect of
temperature on mass (< 5%) is smaller than that resulting from the
extrapolation of the equations of state of iron and lower mantle temperatures
are too low to allow for rock and iron miscibility for R<1.75 $R_{\bigoplus}$.
We find that modeling uncertainties dominate over observational uncertainties
for many observed super-Earths. We illustrate these uncertainties explicitly
for Kepler-36b with well-constrained mass and radius. Assuming a core
composition of 0.8$\rho$ Fe (equivalent to 50 mol% S) instead of pure Fe leads
to an increase of the core radius fraction from 0.53 to 0.64. Using a mantle
composition of Mg$_{0.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$SiO$_3$ instead of MgSiO$_3$ leads to a
decrease of the core radius fraction to 0.33. Effects of thermal structure and
the choice of equation of state for the core material on the core radius of
Kepler-36b are small but non-negligible, reaching 2% and 5%, respectively.

machine learning. As such, it has seen a flurry of research with new ideas
proposed continuously. In this work, we revisit a classical idea: Stein's
Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE). We show that, in the context of image recovery,
SURE and its generalizations can be used to train convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for a range of image denoising and recovery problems without any ground
truth data.
  Specifically, our goal is to reconstruct an image $x$ from a noisy linear
transformation (measurement) of the image. We consider two scenarios: one where
no additional data is available and one where we have measurements of other
images that are drawn from the same noisy distribution as $x$, but have no
access to the clean images. Such is the case, for instance, in the context of
medical imaging, microscopy, and astronomy, where noise-less ground truth data
is rarely available.
  We show that in this situation, SURE can be used to estimate the
mean-squared-error loss associated with an estimate of $x$. Using this estimate
of the loss, we train networks to perform denoising and compressed sensing
recovery. In addition, we also use the SURE framework to partially explain and
improve upon an intriguing results presented by Ulyanov et al. in ""Deep Image
Prior"": that a network initialized with random weights and fit to a single
noisy image can effectively denoise that image.

in a gapped chiral spin liquid with Ising anyons (e.g., Kitaev's non-Abelian
spin liquid on the honeycomb lattice). This is especially important in the
regime in which the longitudinal bulk heat conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$ due to
phonons is much larger than the expected quantized thermal Hall conductance
$\kappa_{xy}^{\rm q}=\frac{\pi T}{12} \frac{k_B^2}{\hbar}$ of the ideal
isolated edge mode, so that the thermal Hall angle, i.e., the angle between the
thermal current and the temperature gradient, is small. By modeling the
interaction between a Majorana edge and bulk phonons, we show that the exchange
of energy between the two subsystems leads to a transverse component of the
bulk current and thereby an {\em effective} Hall conductivity. Remarkably, the
latter is equal to the quantized value when the edge and bulk can thermalize,
which occurs for a Hall bar of length $L \gg \ell$, where $\ell$ is a
thermalization length. We obtain $\ell \sim T^{-5}$ for a model of the
Majorana-phonon coupling. We also find that the quality of the quantization
depends on the means of measuring the temperature and, surprisingly, a more
robust quantization is obtained when the lattice, not the spin, temperature is
measured. We present general hydrodynamic equations for the system, detailed
results for the temperature and current profiles, and an estimate for the
coupling strength and its temperature dependence based on a microscopic model
Hamiltonian. Our results may explain recent experiments observing a quantized
thermal Hall conductivity in the regime of small Hall angle,
$\kappa_{xy}/\kappa_{xx} \sim 10^{-3}$, in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

actually connected by the hidden gauge symmetry, which makes the axionic string
unstable and separate into two Alice strings. The Alice string is attached to a
single domain wall due to the QCD instanton effect, solving the domain-wall
problem. This is in the same spirit of the Lazarides-Shafi mechanism, although
the discrete Peccei-Quinn symmetry is not embedded into the center of the
original gauge symmetry. In the DFSZ-type axion model, the domain-wall problem
is avoided by the Witten effect. If the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is explicitly
broken by a small amount, monopoles acquire a tiny electric charge and become
mini-charged dark matter. Interestingly, the quality of the Peccei-Quinn

  Matrix",,,,,"q-bio.CB math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ability to locally degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and interact
with the tumour microenvironment is a key process distinguishing cancer from
normal cells, and is a critical step in the metastatic spread of the tumour.
The invasion of the surrounding tissue involves the coordinated action between
cancer cells, the ECM, the matrix degrading enzymes, and the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This is a regulatory process
through which epithelial cells (ECs) acquire mesenchymal characteristics and
transform to mesenchymal-like cells (MCs). In this paper, we present a new
mathematical model which describes the transition from a collective invasion
strategy for the ECs to an individual invasion strategy for the MCs. We achieve
this by formulating a coupled hybrid system consisting of partial and
stochastic differential equations that describe the evolution of the ECs and
the MCs, respectively. This approach allows one to reproduce in a very natural
way fundamental qualitative features of the current biomedical understanding of
cancer invasion that are not easily captured by classical modelling approaches,
for example, the invasion of the ECM by self-generated gradients and the
appearance of EC invasion islands outside of the main body of the tumour.

interaction. Despite the success of this theory in the description of several
hadronic processes, the elastic scattering is still a theoretical challenge.
This process is characterized by a small transferred momentum and the
perturbative techniques are not applicable. Although nonperturbative results
have been obtained in recent years, we still do not have a full description
within QCD of the quantities related to the elastic scattering, for example,
$\sigma_{tot}$, the $\rho$ parameter and $\sigma_{el}$. In this thesis, the
main interest is in the energy dependence of the ratio
$X=\sigma_{el}/\sigma_{tot}$, $\sigma_{tot}$ and $\rho$. These topics are
divided into three different studies. In the first topic, we develop an
empirical analysis on the ratio $X$. By means of parameterizations with a small
number of free parameters, we have obtained good descriptions of the data on
$pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ scattering. We conclude that the asymptotic black-disk
scenario is not a unique solution and the results favour a grey-disk scenario.
In the second topic, we study the rise of $\sigma_{tot}$ with the energy
through parameterizations based on the Regge-Gribov formalism and we consider
two options for the leading term: a log-square and a log-raised-to-$\gamma$,
with $\gamma$ a free fit parameter. We discuss two analytic methods to connect
the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude: Derivative Dispersion Relations
(DDR) and Asymptotic Uniqueness, which lead to different parameterizations for
$\sigma_{tot}$ and $\rho$. The results favour the DDR method in both formal and
practical contexts. In the third topic, two sub-leading terms for
$\sigma_{tot}$, obtained in a nonperturbative QCD approach, are considered in
fits to $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ data and also in fits to data from meson-baryon and
other baryon-baryon scattering.

frequency and scene heterogeneity, ensuring proper denoising of interferograms
with considerable underlying topography as well as urban areas. A comparison
using synthetic and TanDEM-X bistatic strip map datasets with existing InSAR

readily be integrated into existing nonlocal filters. The resulting digital

is the scarcity of labeled data. Small training sets are in fact of no use to
deep networks as, due to the large number of trainable parameters, they will
very likely be subject to overfitting phenomena. On the other hand, the
increment of the training set size through further manual or semi-automatic
labellings can be costly, if not possible at times. Thus, the standard
techniques to address this issue are transfer learning and data augmentation,
which consists of applying some sort of ""transformation"" to existing labeled
instances to let the training set grow in size. Although this approach works
well in applications such as image classification, where it is relatively
simple to design suitable transformation operators, it is not obvious how to
apply it in more structured scenarios. Motivated by the observation that in
virtually all application domains it is easy to obtain unlabeled data, in this
paper we take a different perspective and propose a \emph{label augmentation}
approach. We start from a small, curated labeled dataset and let the labels
propagate through a larger set of unlabeled data using graph transduction
techniques. This allows us to naturally use (second-order) similarity
information which resides in the data, a source of information which is
typically neglected by standard augmentation techniques. In particular, we show
that by using known game theoretic transductive processes we can create larger
and accurate enough labeled datasets which use results in better trained neural
networks. Preliminary experiments are reported which demonstrate a consistent
improvement over standard image classification datasets.

users specify general properties of structured outputs, such as constraints
imposed by physical laws. We propose a novel framework for simultaneously
learning these constraints and using them for supervision, bypassing the
difficulty of using domain expertise to manually specify constraints. Learning
requires a black-box simulator of structured outputs, which generates valid
labels, but need not model their corresponding inputs or the input-label
relationship. At training time, we constrain the model to produce outputs that
cannot be distinguished from simulated labels by adversarial training.
Providing our framework with a small number of labeled inputs gives rise to a
new semi-supervised structured prediction model; we evaluate this model on
multiple tasks --- tracking, pose estimation and time series prediction --- and
find that it achieves high accuracy with only a small number of labeled inputs.
In some cases, no labels are required at all.

corrections (VCs) for the Coulomb interaction $U$ ($U$-VCs), which are totally
dropped in conventional Migdal-Eliashberg formalism. The $U$-VC in the charge
susceptibility induces strong orbital fluctuations, and the $U$-VC also
enlarges the orbital-fluctuation-mediated attractive interaction. By analyzing
the effective multiorbital Hubbard model for Ba122 pnictides, we find that the
orbital fluctuations develop in all four $d$-orbitals ($t_{2g}$- and
$z^2$-orbitals), by which the FSs are composed. For this reason, nearly
isotropic gap function appears on all the hole-type FSs, including the outer
hole-FS around Z-point composed of $z^2$-orbital. In contrast, nodal gap
structure appears on the electron-type FSs for wide parameter range. The
obtained nodal $s$-wave state changes to fully-gapped $s$-wave state without
sign-reversal ($s_{++}$-wave state) by introducing small amount of impurities,
accompanied by small reduction in $T_c$. The present microscopic theory

errors in designing a first-order algorithm. We focus on gradient descent (GD)
and accelerated gradient (AG) methods for minimizing strongly convex functions
when the gradient has random errors in the form of additive white noise. With
gradient errors, the function values of the iterates need not converge to the
optimal value; hence, we define the robustness of an algorithm to noise as the
asymptotic expected suboptimality of the iterate sequence to input noise power.
For this robustness measure, we provide exact expressions for the quadratic
case using tools from robust control theory and tight upper bounds for the
smooth strongly convex case using Lyapunov functions certified through matrix
inequalities. We use these characterizations within an optimization problem
which selects parameters of each algorithm to achieve a particular trade-off
between rate and robustness. Our results show that AG can achieve acceleration
while being more robust to random gradient errors. This behavior is quite
different than previously reported in the deterministic gradient noise setting.
We also establish some connections between the robustness of an algorithm and
how quickly it can converge back to the optimal solution if it is perturbed
from the optimal point with deterministic noise. Our framework also leads to
practical algorithms that can perform better than other state-of-the-art
methods in the presence of random gradient noise.

For this, we consider the gravitational field produced by a static mass
monopole within the first post-Newtonian approximation of the general theory of
relativity. We study the propagation of a monochromatic electromagnetic wave in
the vicinity of a large, opaque, gravitating sphere. To treat the opaque nature
of the body and its physical size, we implement fully absorbing boundary
conditions and develop a wave-optical treatment of the shadow formed by this
object. Based on this approach, we demonstrate that the structure of the shadow
is determined by the Schwarzschild radius of the body and its physical size.
The shadow's boundary has the shape of a concave rotational hyperboloid bent
inward due to the refractive properties of the curved spacetime. We show that
there is no light in the shadow. However, even in the presence of gravity and
related gravitational bending of photon trajectories there is the bright spot
of Arago that is formed behind a perfectly spherical obscuration.

challenging task. In this paper, we propose a weakly semi-supervised method,
termed as Dual Swap Disentangling (DSD), for disentangling using both labeled
and unlabeled data. Unlike conventional weakly supervised methods that rely on
full annotations on the group of samples, we require only limited annotations
on paired samples that indicate their shared attribute like the color. Our
model takes the form of a dual autoencoder structure. To achieve disentangling
using the labeled pairs, we follow a ""encoding-swap-decoding"" process, where we
first swap the parts of their encodings corresponding to the shared attribute
and then decode the obtained hybrid codes to reconstruct the original input
pairs. For unlabeled pairs, we follow the ""encoding-swap-decoding"" process
twice on designated encoding parts and enforce the final outputs to approximate
the input pairs. By isolating parts of the encoding and swapping them back and
forth, we impose the dimension-wise modularity and portability of the encodings
of the unlabeled samples, which implicitly encourages disentangling under the
guidance of labeled pairs. This dual swap mechanism, tailored for
semi-supervised setting, turns out to be very effective. Experiments on image
datasets from a wide domain show that our model yields state-of-the-art
disentangling performances.

this is the case, there is the possibility that there might be three body bound
states with two charmed mesons and a charmed antimeson. Here we argue that the
theoretical existence of this type of three body molecules is expected from
heavy quark spin symmetry. If applied to the two body sector, this symmetry
implies that the interaction of the $D^{*0} \bar{D}^{*0}$ meson-antimeson pair
in the $J^{PC} = 2^{++}$ channel is the same as in the $J^{PC} = 1^{++}$
$D^{*0} \bar{D}^0$ case. From this we can infer that the $J^P = 3^{-}$ $D^{*0}
D^{*0} \bar{D}^{*0}$ molecule will be able to display the Efimov effect if the
scattering length of the $2^{++}$ channel is close enough to the unitary limit.
Heavy quark spin symmetry also indicates that the $J^P = 2^{-}$ $D^{*0} D^{*0}
\bar{D}^0$ molecule is analogous to the $J^P = 3^{-}$ $D^{*0} D^{*0}
\bar{D}^{*0}$ one. That is, it can also have a geometric spectrum. If we
consider these triply heavy trimers in the isospin symmetric limit, the Efimov
effect disappears and we can in principle predict the fundamental state of the
$2^-$ $D^*D^*\bar{D}$ and $3^-$ $D^* D^* \bar{D}^*$ systems. The same applies
to the $B^*B^* \bar{B}^*$ system: if the $Z_b(10650)$ is an isovector $B^*
\bar{B}^*$ molecule then the $0^-$ isodoublet and the $1^-$, $2^-$ isoquartet
$B^* B^* \bar{B}^*$ trimers might bind, but do not display Efimov physics.
Finally from heavy flavour symmetry it can be argued that scattering in the $B
D$ two-body system might be resonant. This would in turn imply the possibility
of Efimov physics in the $B B D$ three body system.

kinds of microscopic disorders, namely energetic disorder related to the
distribution of localized states and the spatial disorder related to the
morphological features of the material. From a semi-classical picture, the
charge transport properties are crucially determined by both the carrier
mobility and the electrostatic field distribution in the material. Although the
effect of disorders on carrier mobility has been widely studied, how
electrostatic field distribution is distorted by the presence of disorders and
its effect on charge transport remain unanswered. In this paper, we present a
modified space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model for spatially disordered
organic semiconductors based on the fractional-dimensional electrostatic
framework. We show that the thickness dependence of SCLC is related to the
spatial disorder in organic semiconductors. For trap-free transport, the SCLC
exhibits a modified thickness scaling of $J\propto L^{-3\alpha}$, where the
fractional-dimension parameter $\alpha$ accounts for the spatial disorder in
organic semiconductors. The trap-limited and field-dependent mobility are also
shown to obey an $\alpha$-dependent thickness scaling. The modified SCLC model
shows a good agreement with several experiments on spatially disordered organic
semiconductors. By applying this model to the experimental data, the standard
charge transport parameters can be deduced with better accuracy than by using

the Calkin algebra $B(H)/K(H)$. We prove that $W_{ess}^q(A) =W^q(\pi(A) $,

of Narcowich-Ward and Smith-Ward, obtained in the $m=1$ case, and also
generalize a result of M\""{u}ller obtained in case $m \ge 1$ and $q=1$.

prove that there are self-adjoint $K_1, \dots, K_m \in K(H)$ such that ${\bf

fermions commonly consist of networks of Majorana wires and tunnel junctions.
We study a key ingredient of these networks - a topological Josephson junction
with charging energy - and pinpoint crucial features for device implementation.
The phase dependent tunneling term contains both the usual 2pi-periodic
Josephson term and a 4pi-periodic Majorana tunneling term representing the
coupling between Majoranas on both sides of the junction. In non-topological
junctions when the charging energy is small compared to the Josephson tunneling
scale the low energy physics is described by 2pi phase slips. By contrast, in a
topological junction, due to the 4pi periodicity of the tunneling term it is
usually expected that only 4pi phase slips are possible while 2pi phase slips
are suppressed. However, we find that if the ratio between the strengths of the
Majorana assisted tunneling and the Josephson tunneling is small, as is likely
to be the case for many setups, 2pi phase slips occur and may even dominate the
low energy physics. In this limit one can view the 4pi phase slips as a pair of
2pi phase slips with arbitrarily large separation. We provide an effective
descriptions of the system in terms of 2pi and 4pi phase slips valid for all
values of the tunneling ratio. Comparing the spectrum of the effective models
with numerical simulations we determine the cross-over between the 4pi phase
slip regime to 2pi phase slip dominated regime. We also discuss the role of the
charging energy as well as the implications of our results on the dissipative
phase transitions expected in such a system.

adversarial network (DTLC-GAN), an extension of a GAN that can learn
hierarchically interpretable representations without relying on detailed
supervision. To impose a hierarchical inclusion structure on latent variables,
we incorporate a new architecture called the DTLC into the generator input. The
DTLC has a multiple-layer tree structure in which the ON or OFF of the child
node codes is controlled by the parent node codes. By using this architecture
hierarchically, we can obtain the latent space in which the lower layer codes
are selectively used depending on the higher layer ones. To make the latent
codes capture salient semantic features of images in a hierarchically
disentangled manner in the DTLC, we also propose a hierarchical conditional
mutual information regularization and optimize it with a newly defined
curriculum learning method that we propose as well. This makes it possible to
discover hierarchically interpretable representations in a layer-by-layer
manner on the basis of information gain by only using a single DTLC-GAN model.
We evaluated the DTLC-GAN on various datasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, Tiny
ImageNet, 3D Faces, and CelebA, and confirmed that the DTLC-GAN can learn
hierarchically interpretable representations with either unsupervised or weakly
supervised settings. Furthermore, we applied the DTLC-GAN to image-retrieval

analyzing a large amount of human trafficking related information. Existing
supervised learning methods cannot be directly applied to this problem due to
the distinct characteristics of the social media data. First, the short, noisy,

effective in detecting human trafficking related tweets. Second, complex social
interactions lead to a high-dimensional feature space and thus present great
computational challenges. In the meanwhile, social sciences theories such as
homophily have been well established and achieved success in various social

bottom layers. We find that this layer localization and the energy spectrum
itself are tunable by a global electrostatic gate and that the latter also
coincides with the electronic modes in a graphene disk. Curiously, states with
energy close to the continuum exist primarily in the classically forbidden
region outside the domain defining the blister. The results are robust against
variations in size and shape of the blister which shows that it is a versatile
system to achieve tunable electrostatic confinement in graphene.

challenging in that high-density people make object segmentation and tracking

descriptor referred to as shape contexts to describe such short-term
trajectories. Furthermore, we propose a K-NN similarity-based statistical model
to detect anomalies over time and space, which is an unsupervised one-class
learning algorithm requiring no clustering nor any prior assumption. Firstly,
we retrieve the K-NN samples from the training set in regard to the testing
sample, and then use the similarities between every pair of the K-NN samples to
construct a Gaussian model. Finally, the probabilities of the similarities from
the testing sample to the K-NN samples under the Gaussian model are calculated
in the form of a joint probability. Abnormal events can be detected by judging
whether the joint probability is below predefined thresholds in terms of time
and space, separately. Such a scheme can adapt to the whole scene, since the
probability computed as such is not affected by motion distortions arising from
perspective distortion. We conduct experiments on real-world surveillance
videos, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can reliably
detect and locate the abnormal events in the video sequences, outperforming the
state-of-the-art approaches.

sector. However, when coupled minimally to a symmetry breaking sector that

small neutrino mass scale, or to non-perturbative values of the gauge

breaking sector, the successful predictions of these models for fermion masses
and mixings can be maintained. The $54_H$ enables a reduction of the $B-L$
symmetry breaking scale to an intermediate value of order $10^{12}$ GeV,
consistent with the observed neutrino mass spectrum, while preserving
perturbative gauge coupling unification. We obtain an excellent fit to all
fermion masses and mixings in this framework. We analyze carefully the
prediction of the model for CP violation in neutrino oscillations. Consistency
with proton lifetime, however, requires a mini-split SUSY spectrum with the
squarks and sleptons having masses of order 100 TeV, accompanied by TeV scale
gauginos and Higgsinos. Such a spectrum may arise from pure gravity mediation,

reducing the number of iterations required for convergence. This is achieved by
treating the assignment step and the update step of Lloyd's algorithm as a
fixed-point iteration, and applying Anderson acceleration, a well-established
technique for accelerating fixed-point solvers. Classical Anderson acceleration
utilizes m previous iterates to find an accelerated iterate, and its
performance on K-Means clustering can be sensitive to choice of m and the
distribution of samples. We propose a new strategy to dynamically adjust the
value of m, which achieves robust and consistent speedups across different
problem instances. Our method complements existing acceleration techniques, and
can be combined with them to achieve state-of-the-art performance. We perform
extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, where
it outperforms other algorithms in 106 out of 120 test cases, and the mean
decrease ratio of computational time is more than 33%.

used tools for model comparison in social science research. The BIC however is
not suitable for evaluating models with order constraints on the parameters of
interest. This paper explores two extensions of the BIC for evaluating order
constrained models, one where a truncated unit information prior is used under
the order-constrained model, and the other where a truncated local unit
information prior is used. The first prior is centered around the maximum
likelihood estimate and the latter prior is centered around a null value.
Several analyses show that the order-constrained BIC based on the local unit
information prior works better as an Occam's razor for evaluating
order-constrained models and results in lower error probabilities. The
methodology based on the local unit information prior is implemented in the R
package `BICpack' which allows researchers to easily apply the method for
order-constrained model selection. The usefulness of the methodology is
illustrated using data from the European Values Study.

the numerical relativity to solve the Einstein equations. As the third major
category method to solve partial differential equations, finite element method
is much less used in numerical relativity. In this paper we design a finite
element algorithm to solve the evolution part of the Einstein equations. This
paper is the second one of a systematic investigation of applying adaptive
finite element method to the Einstein equations, especially aim for binary
compact objects simulations. The first paper of this series has been
contributed to the constrained part of the Einstein equations for initial data.
Since applying finite element method to the Einstein equations is a big
project, we mainly propose the theoretical framework of a finite element
algorithm together with local discontinuous Galerkin method for the Einstein
equations in the current work. In addition, we have tested our algorithm based
on the spherical symmetric spacetime evolution. In order to simplify our
numerical tests, we have reduced the problem to a one-dimensional space problem
by taking the advantage of the spherical symmetry. Our reduced equation system
is a new formalism for spherical symmetric spacetime simulation. Based on our
test results, we find that our finite element method can capture the shock
formation which is introduced by numerical error. In contrast, such shock is
smoothed out by numerical dissipation within the finite difference method. We
suspect this is the part reason for that the accuracy of finite element method
is higher than finite difference method. At the same time kinds of formulation
parameters setting are also discussed.

conventional radar due to its antenna and waveform diversity. Although higher
angular resolution, improved parameter identifiability, and better target
detection are achieved, the hardware costs (due to multiple transmitters and
multiple receivers) and high energy consumption (multiple pulses) limit the
usage of MIMO radars in large scale networks. On one hand, higher angle and
velocity estimation accuracy is required, but on the other hand, a lower number
of antennas/pulses is desirable. To achieve such a compromise, in this work,
the Cram'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the angle and velocity estimator is
employed as a performance metric to design the antenna and pulse placement. It
is shown that the CRLB derived for two targets is a more appropriate criterion
in comparison with the single-target CRLB since the two-target CRLB takes into
account both the mainlobe width and sidelobe level of the ambiguity function.
In this paper, several algorithms for antenna and pulse selection based on
convex and submodular optimization are proposed. Numerical experiments are

spinning. Given how small the electron is generally taken to be, it would have
to rotate superluminally to have the right angular momentum and magnetic
moment. Also, the electron's gyromagnetic ratio is twice the value one would
expect for an ordinary classical rotating charged body. These obstacles can be
overcome by examining the flow of mass and charge in the Dirac field
(interpreted as giving the classical state of the electron). Superluminal
velocities are avoided because the electron's mass and charge are spread over
sufficiently large distances that neither the velocity of mass flow nor the
velocity of charge flow need to exceed the speed of light. The electron's
gyromagnetic ratio is twice the expected value because its charge rotates twice
as fast as its mass.

  Heterogeneous Latency Requirements",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In light of the quick proliferation of Internet of things (IoT) devices and
applications, fog radio access network (Fog-RAN) has been recently proposed for
fifth generation (5G) wireless communications to assure the requirements of
ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for the IoT applications which
cannot accommodate large delays. Hence, fog nodes (FNs) are equipped with
computing, signal processing and storage capabilities to extend the inherent
operations and services of the cloud to the edge. We consider the problem of
sequentially allocating the FN's limited resources to the IoT applications of
heterogeneous latency requirements. For each access request from an IoT user,
the FN needs to decide whether to serve it locally utilizing its own resources
or to refer it to the cloud to conserve its valuable resources for future users
of potentially higher utility to the system (i.e., lower latency requirement).
We formulate the Fog-RAN resource allocation problem in the form of a Markov
decision process (MDP), and employ several reinforcement learning (RL) methods,
namely Q-learning, SARSA, Expected SARSA, and Monte Carlo, for solving the MDP
problem by learning the optimum decision-making policies. We verify the
performance and adaptivity of the RL methods and compare it with the
performance of a fixed-threshold-based algorithm. Extensive simulation results
considering 19 IoT environments of heterogeneous latency requirements
corroborate that RL methods always achieve the best possible performance
regardless of the IoT environment.

effort for decades. Modeling the noise performance plays a crucial role in
isolating the noise sources and reducing them. Modeling to date has either used
analytical or semi-analytical implementation of dynamical methods or Monte
Carlo simulations. The former approach is too simplified to accurately assess
the noise performance in real laser systems, while the latter approach is too
computationally slow to optimize the performance as parameters vary over a wide
range. Here, we describe a computational implementation of dynamical methods
that allows us to determine the noise performance of a passively modelocked
laser within minutes on a desktop computer and is faster than Monte Carlo
methods by a factor on the order of 1000. We apply this method to characterize
a laser that is locked using a fast saturable absorber---for example, a
fiber-based nonlinear polarization rotation---and a laser that is locked using
a slow saturable absorber---for example, a semiconductor saturable absorbing
mirror.

fundamental in the design of regenerative devices. Crosslinking of electrospun
fibres from gelatin is required to prevent dissolution in water, to retain the
original nanofibre morphology after immersion in water, and to improve the
thermal and mechanical properties, although this is still challenging to
accomplish in a controlled fashion. In this study, we have investigated the
scalable manufacture and structural stability in aqueous environment of a
UV-cured nanofibrous membrane fabricated by free surface electrospinning (FSES)
of aqueous solutions containing vinylbenzylated gelatin and
poly(epsilon-caprolactone) dimethacrylate (PCL-DMA). Vinylbenzylated gelatin
was obtained via chemical functionalisation with photopolymerisable
4-vinylbenzyl chloride (4VBC) groups, so that the gelatin and PCL phase in
electrospun fibres were integrated in a covalent UV-cured co-network at the
molecular scale, rather than being simply physically mixed. UV-cured
nanofibrous membranes did not dissolve in water and showed enhanced thermal and
mechanical properties, with respect to as-spun samples, indicating the
effectiveness of the photo-crosslinking reaction. In addition, UV-cured
gelatin/PCL membranes displayed increased structural stability in water with
respect to PCL-free samples and were highly tolerated by G292 osteosarcoma
cells. These results therefore support the use of PCL DMA as hydrophobic,
biodegradable crosslinker and provide new insight on the scalable design of
water insoluble, mechanical competent gelatin membranes for healthcare
applications.
