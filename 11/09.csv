Cartesian coordinates on an oblate spheroid, presented by Panou and Korakitis
(2017), are generalized on a triaxial ellipsoid. A new exact analytical method
and a new numerical method of converting Cartesian to ellipsoidal coordinates
of a point on a triaxial ellipsoid are presented. An extensive test set for the
coordinate conversion is used, in order to evaluate the performance of the two
methods. The direct geodesic problem on a triaxial ellipsoid is described as an
initial value problem and is solved numerically in Cartesian coordinates. The
solution provides the Cartesian coordinates and the angle between the line of
constant {\lambda} and the geodesic, at any point along the geodesic. Also, the
Liouville constant is computed at any point along the geodesic, allowing to
check the precision of the method. An extensive data set of geodesics is used,
in order to demonstrate the validity of the numerical method for the geodesic
problem. We conclude that a complete, stable and precise solution of the
problem is accomplished.

technological applications. Their dissolution or growth dynamics is complex.
Differences in solubility between the drop components combined with the solutal
Marangoni effect and natural convections contribute to this complexity, which
can be even further increased in combination with the ouzo effect, i.e., the
spontaneous nucleation of microdroplets due to composition-dependent
miscibilities in a ternary system. The quantitive understanding of this
combined process is important for applications in industry, particularly for
modern liquid-liquid microextraction processes. In this work, as a model
system, we experimentally and theoretically explore water/ethanol drops
dissolving in anethole oil. During the dissolution, we observed two types of
microdroplets nucleation, namely water microdroplet nucleation in the
surrounding oil at drop midheight and oil microdroplet nucleation in the
aqueous drop, again at midheight. The nucleated oil microdroplets are driven by
Marangoni flows inside the aqueous drop and evolve into microdroplets rings. A
one-dimensional multiphase and multicomponent diffusion model in combination
with thermodynamical equilibrium theory is proposed to predict the behavior of
spontaneous emulsification, i.e. the microdroplet nucleation, that is triggered
by diffusion. A scale analysis together with experimental investigations of the
fluid dynamics of the system reveals that both the solutal Marangoni flow
inside the drop and the buoyancy-driven flow in the host liquid influence the
diffusion-triggered emulsification process. Our work provides a physical
understanding of the microdroplet nucleation by dissolution of a multicomponent
drop in a host liquid.

use of cryptographic techniques, such as message authentication codes that
provide data integrity guarantees. However, such mechanisms require significant
resources, which prevents their continuous use in resource-constrained
cyber-physical systems. Recently, it was shown how physical properties of
plants can be exploited to relax these requirements for systems where sensor
measurements and actuator commands are transmitted over a compromised network;
specifically, intermittent use of data authentication, can still provide
Quality-of-Control (QoC) guarantees even in the presence of false-data
injection attacks. Consequently, in this work we focus on integrating security
into existing systems, in order to protect against these attacks. We introduce
a design-time methodology that incorporates requirements for QoC in the
presence of attacks into end-to-end timing constraints for real-time control
transactions, which include data acquisition and authentication, communication,
and control. This allows us to formulate a mixed integer linear
programming-based method for synthesis of schedulable task and message
parameters (i.e., deadlines and offsets) that maintain timing requirements of
deployed controllers, while adding a sufficient level of protection against
attacks; specifically, this method provides suitable intermittent
authentication policies that ensure the desired QoC levels under attack. To
additionally reduce the security-related bandwidth overhead, we propose the use
of cumulative message authentication. Furthermore, we introduce a method for
opportunistic use of remaining resources to further improve the overall QoC
guarantees while ensuring system schedulability. Finally, we demonstrate
applicability of our methodology on synthetic automotive systems as well as an
automotive case-study.

in different forms of digital contents. People share digital life records
during collocated events, such as sharing blogs they wrote, Twitter posts they
forwarded, and books they have read. However, connecting experiences during
collocated events are challenging. Not only one is blind to the large contents
of others, identifying related experiential items depends on how well
experiences are retrieved. The collection of personal contents from all
participants forms a valuable group repository, from which connections between
experiences can be mined. Visualizing same or related experiences inspire
conversations and support social exchange. Common topics in group content also
help participants generate new perspectives about the collocated group.
Advances in machine learning and data visualization provide automated
approaches to process large data and enable interactions with data

utilize state-of-the-art data processing and visualization techniques to design
event mining systems for connecting experiences during collocated activities.

finite collections of arithmetic progressions that cover the integers) have
been extensively studied, and numerous questions and conjectures have been
posed regarding the existence of covering systems with various properties. In
particular, Erd\H{o}s asked if the moduli can be distinct and all arbitrarily
large, Erd\H{o}s and Selfridge asked if the moduli can be distinct and all odd,
and Schinzel conjectured that in any covering system there exists a pair of
moduli, one of which divides the other.
  Another beautiful conjecture, proposed by Erd\H{o}s and Graham in 1980,
states that if the moduli are distinct elements of the interval $[n,Cn]$, and
$n$ is sufficiently large, then the density of integers uncovered by the union
is bounded below by a constant (depending only on $C$). This conjecture was
confirmed (in a strong form) by Filaseta, Ford, Konyagin, Pomerance and Yu in
2007, who moreover asked whether the same conclusion holds if the moduli are
distinct and sufficiently large, and $\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{d_i} < C$. Although
this condition turns out not to be sufficiently strong to imply the desired
conclusion, as the main result of this paper we will give an essentially best
possible condition which is sufficient.
  Our method has a number of further applications. Most importantly, we prove
the conjecture of Schinzel stated above, which was made in 1967. We moreover
give an alternative (somewhat simpler) proof of a breakthrough result of Hough,
who resolved Erd\H{o}s' minimum modulus problem, with an improved bound on the
smallest difference. Finally, we make further progress on the problem of
Erd\H{o}s and Selfridge.

topological string theory on a class of toric Calabi-Yau manifolds without
compact four-cycles, also referred to as strip geometries. We show that various
quantities that characterize open topological string theory on these manifolds,
such as partition functions, Gromov-Witten invariants, or open BPS invariants,
can be expressed in terms of characteristics of the moduli space of
representations of the corresponding quiver. This has various deep
consequences; in particular, expressing open BPS invariants in terms of motivic
Donaldson-Thomas invariants, immediately proves integrality of the former ones.
Taking advantage of the relation to quivers we also derive explicit expressions
for classical open BPS invariants for an arbitrary strip geometry, which lead
to a large set of number theoretic integrality statements. Furthermore, for a
specific framing, open topological string partition functions for strip
geometries take form of generalized $q$-hypergeometric functions, which leads
to a novel representation of these functions in terms of quantum dilogarithms
and integral invariants. We also study quantum curves and A-polynomials
associated to quivers, various limits thereof, and their specializations
relevant for strip geometries. The relation between toric manifolds and quivers
can be regarded as a generalization of the knots-quivers correspondence to more
general Calabi-Yau geometries.

events that produced these clouds. Our methods utilize magnetograms from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument on the Solar Dynamics

flux tube has two magnetic origination points at the positions of the strongest
radial magnetic field regions of opposite polarity near the places where the
ejected arches end at the solar surface. We were unable to find events for the
remaining 29 cases: lack of a halo or partial halo CME in an appropriate time
window, lack of magnetic and/or filament activity in the proper part of the
solar disk, or the event was too far from disk center. The occurrence of a

recast the latest $\tau\tau$ and $\tau\nu$ resonance search data to obtain new

in setting the exclusion limits. To obtain precise limits, we include
non-negligible effects coming from the subdominant (resonant) pair and
inclusive single leptoquark productions systematically in our analysis. To deal
with large destructive interference, we make use of the transverse mass
distributions from the experiments in our statistical analysis. In addition, we
also recast the relevant direct search results to obtain the most stringent
collider bounds on these scenarios to date. These are independent bounds and
are competitive to other known bounds. Finally, we indicate how one can adopt

stars in the chemically evolving Universe. In particular, this requires
knowledge of the distribution of cosmic star formation rate at different
metallicities and times, probed by redshift (SFR(Z,z)). We investigate the

reported tension between the merger rates of different types of double compact

SFR(Z,z) closer to that expected based on observations of local star-forming
galaxies is used, without the need for changing the assumptions about the
evolution of progenitor stars of different masses. This highlights the
importance of finding tighter constraints on SFR(Z,z) and understanding the

this deficiency by using approaches such as incorporating dependencies between
query terms, using bi-gram representations of documents, proximity heuristics,
and passage retrieval. While some of these previous works have implicitly
accounted for term order, to the best of our knowledge, term order has not been

two query terms in the same order as in the query have a higher probability of
being relevant than documents that have two query terms in the reverse order.
Using the axiomatic framework for information retrieval, we introduce a
constraint that retrieval models must adhere to in order to effectively utilize
term order dependency among query terms. We modify existing retrieval models
based on this constraint so that if the order of a pair of query terms is
semantically important, a document that includes these query terms in the same
order as the query should receive a higher score compared to a document that
includes them in the reverse order. Our empirical evaluation using both TREC

crucial. In this paper, we introduce Deep Probabilistic Ensembles (DPEs), a
scalable technique that uses a regularized ensemble to approximate a deep BNN.
We conduct a series of large-scale visual active learning experiments to
evaluate DPEs on classification with the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet
datasets, and semantic segmentation with the BDD100k dataset. Our models
require significantly less training data to achieve competitive performances,
and steadily improve upon strong active learning baselines as the annotation
budget is increased.

been shown that the response of the atomic medium can be tunned from highly

with the partial dressed state approach which makes the backbone of the

The population dynamics and the coherence contribution in each case has been
analyzed by the time dependent solutions. The experimentally observed steady

independent from labeling errors and requires knowledge about the intrinsic

relative comparison of label bias for different low redshift galaxy morphology
data sets. We show our metric is able to recover previous de-biasing procedures
based on redshift as biasing parameter. By using the image resolution instead,
we find biases that have not been addressed. We find that the morphologies
based on supervised machine-learning trained over features such as colors,
shape, and concentration show significantly less bias than morphologies based
on expert or citizen-science classifiers. This result holds even when there is
underlying bias present in the training sets used in the supervised machine
learning process. We use catalog simulations to validate our bias metric, and
show how to bin the multidimensional intrinsic and observed galaxy properties
used in the bias quantification. Our approach is designed to work on any other

advances coming from both research and industry. A major challenge in quantum
programming is dealing with errors (quantum noise) during execution. Because
quantum resources (e.g., qubits) are scarce, classical error correction
techniques applied at the level of the architecture are currently
cost-prohibitive. But while this reality means that quantum programs are almost
certain to have errors, there as yet exists no principled means to reason about
erroneous behavior. This paper attempts to fill this gap by developing a
semantics for erroneous quantum while-programs, as well as a logic for
reasoning about them. This logic permits proving a property we have identified,
called $\epsilon$-robustness, which characterizes possible ""distance"" between
an ideal program and an erroneous one. We have proved the logic sound, and
showed its utility on several case studies, notably: (1) analyzing the
robustness of noisy versions of the quantum Bernoulli factory (QBF) and quantum

correction schemes on single-qubit errors; and (3) analyzing the robustness of
a fault-tolerant version of QBF.

counterpart of the classic Kirszbraun theorem for outer bi-Lipschitz
extensions. We also study outer bi-Lipschitz extensions of near-isometric maps
and show upper and lower bounds for them. Then, we present applications of our
results to prioritized and terminal dimension reduction problems.
  * We prove a prioritized variant of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma: given a
set of points $X\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of size $N$ and a permutation (""priority
ranking"") of $X$, there exists an embedding $f$ of $X$ into $\mathbb{R}^{O(\log

$O(\log^{3 + \varepsilon} j)$ non-zero coordinates - more specifically, all but
the first $O(\log^{3+\varepsilon} j)$ coordinates are equal to $0$; the
distortion of $f$ restricted to the first $j$ points (according to the ranking)
is at most $O(\log\log j)$. The result makes a progress towards answering an
open question by Elkin, Filtser, and Neiman about prioritized dimension
reductions.
  * We prove that given a set $X$ of $N$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists
a terminal dimension reduction embedding of $\mathbb{R}^d$ into
$\mathbb{R}^{d'}$, where $d' = O\left(\frac{\log N}{\varepsilon^4}\right)$,
which preserves distances $\|x-y\|$ between points $x\in X$ and $y \in

Conservative Reproducing Kernel Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (CRK-SPH). We

non-radiative hydrodynamics. Each contains 2x2304^3 cold dark matter plus
baryon particles in an 800 Mpc/h box. We compare statistics to previous
non-radiative simulations including power spectra, mass functions, baryon

Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7. We employ an updated analysis framework that
includes detailed mock catalogues to model observational effects in SDSS. Our
results constrain the colour-dependent conditional luminosity function (CLF) of
dark matter haloes, as well as the radial profile of satellite galaxies.
Confirming previous results, we find that red central galaxies live in more
massive haloes than blue galaxies at fixed luminosity. Additionally, our
results suggest that satellite galaxies have a radial profile less centrally
concentrated than dark matter but not as cored as resolved subhaloes in dark
matter-only simulations. Compared to previous works using satellite kinematics
by More et al., we find much more competitive constraints on the galaxy-halo
connection, on par with those derived from a combination of galaxy clustering
and galaxy-galaxy lensing. We compare our results on the galaxy-halo connection
to other studies using galaxy clustering and group catalogues, showing very
good agreement between these different techniques. We discuss future
applications of satellite kinematics in the context of constraining cosmology
and the relationship between galaxies and dark matter haloes.

scale disasters for effective first response and disaster relief, our general
understanding of evacuation behavior remains limited because of the lack of
empirical evidence on the evacuation movement of individuals across multiple
disaster instances. Here we investigate the GPS trajectories of a total of more
than 1 million anonymized mobile phone users whose positions are tracked for a
period of 2 months before and after four of the major earthquakes that occurred
in Japan. Through a cross comparative analysis between the four disaster
instances, we find that in contrast with the assumed complexity of evacuation
decision making mechanisms in crisis situations, the individuals' evacuation
probability is strongly dependent on the seismic intensity that they
experience. In fact, we show that the evacuation probabilities in all
earthquakes collapse into a similar pattern, with a critical threshold at
around seismic intensity 5.5. This indicates that despite the diversity in the
earthquakes profiles and urban characteristics, evacuation behavior is
similarly dependent on seismic intensity. Moreover, we found that probability
density functions of the distances that individuals evacuate are not dependent
on seismic intensities that individuals experience. These insights from
empirical analysis on evacuation from multiple earthquake instances using large
scale mobility data contributes to a deeper understanding of how people react
to earthquakes, and can potentially assist decision makers to simulate and
predict the number of evacuees in urban areas with little computational time
and cost, by using population density information and seismic intensity which
can be observed instantaneously after the shock.

that the structural information of the tree can be uniquely extracted by
measuring the MFPT for two randomly chosen types of tracer particles with

problem: for finite chemical potentials, the QCD action becomes complex and the
Boltzmann weight $e^{-S}$ cannot be interpreted as a probability distribution
to determine expectation values by Monte Carlo techniques. Different
workarounds have been devised to study the QCD phase diagram, but their
application is mostly limited to the region of small chemical potentials. The
Lefschetz thimbles method takes a new approach in which one complexifies the
theory and deforms the integration paths. By integrating over Lefschetz
thimbles, the imaginary part of the action is kept constant and can be factored
out, while $e^{-Re(S)}$ can be interpreted as a probability measure. The method
has been applied in recent years to more or less difficult problems. Here we
report preliminary results on Lefschetz thimbles regularization of heavy-dense
QCD. While still simple, this is a very interesting problem. It is a first look
at thimbles for QCD, although in a simplified, effective version. From an
algorithmic point of view, it is a nice ground to test effectiveness of
techniques we developed for multi thimbles simulations.

is well-suited for such non-Hermitian problems, and its stochastic nature can
handle the 3-body interactions exactly without undue increase in computational
cost. The highly compact nature of the right eigenvectors means that the
initiator approximation in FCIQMC is not severe, and that large lattices can be
simulated, well beyond the reach of the method applied to the original Hubbard
Hamiltonian. Results are provided in lattice sizes upto 50 sites and compared

individual bullet-like features; some of these bullets subscribe to a `Hubble
Law' velocity relation, and others are manifest as `Hubble wedges'. In order to
explore the origin of these features, we have developed a new episodic outflow
model for the SPH code {\sc gandalf}, which mimics the accretion and ejection
behaviour of FU Ori type stars. We apply this model to simulations of star
formation, invoking two types of initial conditions: spherically symmetric
cores in solid-body rotation with $\rho\propto r^{-2}$, and spherically
symmetric turbulent cores with density proportional to the density of a
Bonnor-Ebert sphere. For a wide range of model parameters, we find that
episodic outflows lead to self-regulation of the ejected mass and momentum, and
we achieve acceptable results, even with relatively low resolution. Using this
model, we find that recently ejected outflow bullets produce a `Hubble wedge'
in the position-velocity relation. However, once such a bullet hits the leading
shock front, it decelerates and aligns with older bullets to form a
`Hubble-law'. Bullets can be identified as bumps in the mass-velocity relation,
which can be fit with a power-law, $dM/d\upsilon_{_{\rm

techniques have been developed to compress the gradients. But these techniques
could perform poorly when used together with decentralized aggregation
protocols like ring all-reduce (RAR), mainly due to their inability to directly
aggregate compressed gradients. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate the
strong linear correlations between CNN gradients, and propose a gradient vector
quantization technique, named GradiVeQ, to exploit these correlations through
principal component analysis (PCA) for substantial gradient dimension
reduction. GradiVeQ enables direct aggregation of compressed gradients, hence
allows us to build a distributed learning system that parallelizes GradiVeQ
gradient compression and RAR communications. Extensive experiments on popular
CNNs demonstrate that applying GradiVeQ slashes the wall-clock gradient
aggregation time of the original RAR by more than 5X without noticeable
accuracy loss, and reduces the end-to-end training time by almost 50%. The
results also show that GradiVeQ is compatible with scalar quantization
techniques such as QSGD (Quantized SGD), and achieves a much higher speed-up
gain under the same compression ratio.

Compared to an equivalent simulation using state-of-the-art software, the

estimate biases of $b_{early} \approx 4.06 \pm 0.67$ and $b_{late} \approx 2.98

function at the 10-$\sigma$ level, we have calculated the predicted number of
detectable cold dark matter (CDM) line-of-sight haloes to be $\mu_{l} =

sensitivity that improved to the level implied by a 5-$\sigma$ threshold, the

by a fast encounter, after which the stream grows a loop of stars at different
orbital energies. At specific viewing angles, this loop appears offset from the
stream track. A quantitative comparison of the spur and gap features prefers
models where the perturber is in the mass range of $10^6\,\rm M_\odot$ to

consequences for measurements of the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF),
star-formation-rate density (SFRD) and star-forming main sequence (SFMS). We
investigate the effects of the exponentially declining, delayed exponentially
declining, lognormal and double power law SFH models using BAGPIPES. We
demonstrate that each of these models imposes strong priors on specific
star-formation rates (sSFRs), potentially biasing the SFMS, and also imposes a
strong prior preference for young stellar populations. We show that stellar
mass, SFR and mass-weighted age inferences from high-quality mock photometry
vary with the choice of SFH model by at least 0.1, 0.3 and 0.2 dex
respectively. However the biases with respect to the true values depend more on
the true SFH shape than the choice of model. We also demonstrate that
photometric data cannot discriminate between SFH models, meaning it is
important to perform independent tests to find well-motivated priors. We
finally fit a low-redshift, volume-complete sample of galaxies from the Galaxy

stellar masses and SFRs at redshift, $z\sim0.05$ are consistent with other
analyses. However, our inferred cosmic SFRDs peak at $z\sim0.4$, approximately

dust thermal emission, CO emission and scattered light observations. We find
that the dust gaps observed at 24 au and 41 au can be explained by two
super-Earths ($\sim 4 \mathrm{M}_{\oplus}$). A planet of approximately
Saturn-mass can explain the CO emission and the depth and width of the gap seen
in scattered light at 94 au. Our model produces a prominent spiral arm while
there are only hints of this in the data. To avoid runaway growth and migration
of the planets we require a disc mass of $\lesssim 10^{-2}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$
in agreement with CO observations but 10$-$100 times lower than the estimate
from HD line emission.

`gold standard' for galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling as they
are flexible enough to describe the full diversity of SFH shapes, whereas
parametric models rule out a significant fraction of these shapes {\it a
priori}. However, this flexibility is not fully constrained even with
high-quality observations, making it critical to choose a well-motivated prior.
Here, we use the SED-fitting code \texttt{Prospector} to explore the effect of
different nonparametric priors by fitting SFHs to mock UV-IR photometry
generated from a diverse set of input SFHs. First, we confirm that
nonparametric SFHs recover input SFHs with less bias and return more accurate
errors than do parametric SFHs. We further find that, while nonparametric SFHs
robustly recover the overall shape of the input SFH, the primary determinant of
the size and shape of the posterior star formation rate (SFR) as a function of
time is the choice of prior, rather than the photometric noise. As a practical
demonstration, we fit the UV-IR photometry of $\sim$6000 galaxies from the GAMA
survey and measure inter-prior scatters in mass (0.1 dex), SFR$_{100\;
\mathrm{Myr}}$ (0.8 dex), and mass-weighted ages (0.2 dex), with the bluest
star-forming galaxies showing the most sensitivity. An important distinguishing
characteristic for nonparametric models is the characteristic timescale for
changes in SFR(t). This difference controls whether galaxies are assembled in
bursts or in steady-state star formation, corresponding respectively to
(feedback-dominated/accretion-dominated) models of galaxy formation and to
(larger/smaller) confidence intervals derived from SED-fitting. High-quality
spectroscopy has the potential to further distinguish between these proposed
models of SFR(t).

from continuum reverberation mapping with data from the Dark Energy Survey

lightcurves with the \textit{griz} photometry that span five seasons of DES
observations. These data sample the time variability of the quasars with a
cadence as short as one day, which corresponds to a rest frame cadence that is
a factor of a few higher than most previous work. We derive time lags between
bands with both JAVELIN and the interpolated cross-correlation function method,
and fit for accretion disk sizes using the JAVELIN Thin Disk model. These new
measurements include disks around black holes with masses as small as
$\sim10^7$ $M_{\odot}$, which have equivalent sizes at 2500\AA \, as small as
$\sim 0.1$ light days in the rest frame. We find that most objects have
accretion disk sizes consistent with the prediction of the standard thin disk
model when we take disk variability into account. We have also simulated the
expected yield of accretion disk measurements under various observational
scenarios for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Deep Drilling Fields. We find
that the number of disk measurements would increase significantly if the

(BHs) that are produced by BH mergers can be retained, dynamically form new BH
binaries, and merge again. This process can repeat several times and lead to
significant mass growth. In this paper, we calculate the mass of the largest BH
that can be formed through repeated mergers of stellar seed BHs and determine
how its value depends on the physical properties of the host cluster. We adopt
an analytical model in which the energy generated by the black hole binaries in
the cluster core is assumed to be regulated by the process of two-body
relaxation in the bulk of the system. This principle is used to compute the
hardening rate of the binaries and to relate this to the time-dependent global
properties of the parent cluster. We demonstrate that in clusters with initial
escape velocity $\gtrsim 300\rm km\ s^{-1}$ in the core and density $\gtrsim
10^5\ M_\odot\rm pc^{-3}$, repeated mergers lead to the formation of BHs in the
mass range $100-10^5 \,M_\odot$, populating any upper mass gap created by
pair-instability supernovae. This result is independent of cluster metallicity
and the initial BH spin distribution. We show that about $10\%$ of the
present-day nuclear star clusters meet these extreme conditions, and estimate
that BH binary mergers with total mass $\gtrsim 100\,M _\odot$ should be
produced in these systems at a maximum rate $\approx 0.05 \,\rm Gpc^{-3}
yr^{-1}$, corresponding to one detectable event every few years with Advanced
LIGO/VIRGO at design sensitivity. The contribution of globular clusters is
likely to be negligible instead because the first BH merger remnant escapes
following the relativistic kick. A possible connection of our results to the
formation of massive BH seeds in galaxy nuclei and globular clusters is
discussed.

growth of supermassive black holes. However, observational support for this
hypothesis is mixed, with some studies showing a correlation between merging
galaxies and luminous quasars and others showing no such association. Recent
observations have shown that a black hole is likely to become heavily obscured
behind merger-driven gas and dust, even in the early stages of the merger, when
the galaxies are well separated (5 to 40 kiloparsecs). Merger simulations
further suggest that such obscuration and black-hole accretion peaks in the
final merger stage, when the two galactic nuclei are closely separated (less
than 3 kiloparsecs). Resolving this final stage requires a combination of
high-spatial-resolution infrared imaging and high-sensitivity hard-X-ray
observations to detect highly obscured sources. However, large numbers of
obscured luminous accreting supermassive black holes have been recently
detected nearby (distances below 250 megaparsecs) in X-ray observations. Here
we report high-resolution infrared observations of hard-X-ray-selected black
holes and the discovery of obscured nuclear mergers, the parent populations of
supermassive-black-hole mergers. We find that obscured luminous black holes
(bolometric luminosity higher than 2x10^44 ergs per second) show a significant
(P<0.001) excess of late-stage nuclear mergers (17.6 per cent) compared to a
sample of inactive galaxies with matching stellar masses and star formation
rates (1.1 per cent), in agreement with theoretical predictions. Using
hydrodynamic simulations, we confirm that the excess of nuclear mergers is
indeed strongest for gas-rich major-merger hosts of obscured luminous black
holes in this final stage.

correctness of basic broadcast abstractions over federated quorum systems and
establish their relationship to the classical Byzantine quorum systems. In

the proposed lower bound can be used to satisfy a prescribed probabilistic

Voronoi partition-based to check the reach-avoid constraints at representative
partitions (cells), instead of the original scenarios. The state constraints
arising from the safe and target sets are tightened appropriately so that the

of resolution of identify techniques, the code is designed specifically for
non-periodic systems. Application to the small molecule reference set
successfully validates the methodology and its implementation for a variety of
excitation types covering an energy range from 2-8 eV in single molecules.
Further, embedding each GW-BSE calculation into an atomistically resolved
surrounding, typically obtained from Molecular Dynamics, accounts for effects
originating from local fields and polarization. Using aqueous DNA as a
prototypical system, different levels of electrostatic coupling between the
regions in this GW-BSE/MM setup are demonstrated. Particular attention is paid
to charge-transfer (CT) excitations in adenine base pairs. It is found that
their energy is extremely sensitive to the specific environment and to
polarization effects. The calculated redshift of the CT excitation energy
compared to a nucelobase dimer treated in vacuum is of the order of 1 eV, which
matches expectations from experimental data. Predicted lowest CT energies are
below that of a single nucleobase excitation, indicating the possibility of an
initial (fast) decay of such an UV excited state into a bi-nucleobase CT
exciton. The results show that VOTCA-XTP's GW-BSE/MM is a powerful tool to

$\pi,K,N$ in central PbPb LHC collisions in this extended region. We further
suggest that ""the outer edge"" has very small azimuthal asymmetry even for

so that looking for suboptimal solutions is of interest. To achieve this goal,
the presence of a linear coupling calls for tailored decomposition approaches.
We propose a fully distributed algorithm based on a primal decomposition
approach and a suitable tightening of the coupling constraints. Agents
repeatedly update local allocation vectors, which converge to an optimal
resource allocation of an approximate version of the original problem. Based on
such allocation vectors, agents are able to (locally) compute a mixed-integer

an alternative multistep pipeline that is part of the rendering pipeline. Once
the tool decides during the initial phase of a page load that a page is
suitable for reader mode use, it directly applies document tree translation
before the page is rendered.

are calculated before the start of treatment, anatomical deviations can result
in poor dose conformity. To overcome these limitations, we present a simulation
study on a fully dynamic real-time adaptive radiation therapy (RT-ART)
optimization approach that uses ultra-fast beamlet control to dynamically adapt
to patient motion in real-time.
  A virtual RT-ART machine was simulated with a rapidly rotating linear
accelerator (LINAC) source (60 RPM) and a binary 1D multi-leaf collimator (MLC)
operating at 100 Hz. If the real-time tracked target motion exceeded a
predefined threshold, a time dependent objective function was solved using fast
optimization methods to calculate new beamlet intensities that were then
delivered to the patient.
  To evaluate the approach, system response was analyzed for patient derived
continuous drift, step-like, and periodic intra-fractional motion. For each
motion type investigated, the RT-ART method was compared against the ideal case
with no patient motion (static case) as well as to the case without the use
RT-ART. In all cases, isodose lines and dose-volume-histograms (DVH) showed
that RT-ART plan quality was approximately the same as the static case, and
considerably better than the no RT-ART case.
  The RT-ART optimization framework has the potential to optimally deliver dose
to a patient in a way that fully accounts for anatomical changes due to motion.
With continued advances in real-time patient motion tracking and fast
computational processes, there is significant potential for the RT-ART
optimization process to be realized on next generation RT machines.

Minkowski spacetime satisfy thermodynamical relations which are the analog of
those satisfied by stationary black holes coupled to standard matter fields.
These properties stem from the fact that light cones are conformal Killing
horizons stationary with respect to observers following the radial conformal
Killing fields in flat spacetime. The four laws of light cone thermodynamics
relate notions such as (conformal) temperature, (conformal) surface gravity,
(conformal) energy and a conformally invariant notion related to area change.
These quantities do not admit a direct physical interpretation in flat
spacetime. However, they become the usual thermodynamical quantities when
Minkowski is mapped, via a Weyl transformation, to a target spacetime where the
conformal Killing field becomes a proper Killing field. In this paper we study
the properties of such spacetimes. The simplest realisation turns out to be the
Bertotti-Robinson solution, which is known to encode the near horizon geometry
of near extremal and extremal charged black holes. The analogy between light
cones in flat space and black hole horizons is therefore strengthened. The
construction works in arbitrary dimensions; in two dimensions one recovers the

such techniques -- for example in the unique coloring of butterfly wings -- to
manipulate photons as they propagate through nanoscale periodic assemblies. In

atomically layered heterostructures -- e.g., mechanical pick-up/transfer

distances smaller than characteristic electronic length-scales (such as
electron wavelength, screening length, and electron mean free path). Yet
electronic metamaterials promise far richer categories of behavior than those
found in conventional optical metamaterial technologies. This is because unlike
photons that scarcely interact with each other, electrons in subwavelength
structured metamaterials are charged, and strongly interact. As a result, an
enormous variety of emergent phenomena can be expected, and radically new

rates are usually based on rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) data. A correction for
dust attenuation, A_UV, is needed for these measurements. This correction is
typically inferred from UV spectral slopes (beta) using an equation known as
""Meurer's Relation."" In this paper, we study this relation at a redshift of 1.5
using images and photometric measurements in the rest-frame UV (HST) through
mid-infrared (Spitzer). It is shown that massive star-forming galaxies (above
10^10 Msun) have dust corrections that are dependent on their inclination to
the line-of-sight. Edge-on galaxies have higher A_UV and infrared excess
(IRX=L(IR)/L(UV)) than face-on galaxies at a given beta. Interestingly, dust
corrections for low-mass star-forming galaxies do not depend on inclination.
This is likely because more massive galaxies have more disk-like
shapes/kinematics, while low-mass galaxies are more prolate and have more
disturbed kinematics. To account for an inclination-dependent dust correction,
a modified Meurer's Relation is derived: A_UV=4.43+1.99 beta - 1.73 (b/a-0.67),
where b/a is the galaxy axis ratio. This inclination-dependence of A_UV can be
explained by a two-component model of the dust distribution inside galaxies. In
such a model, the dust attenuation of edge-on galaxies has a higher
contribution from a ""mixture"" component (dust uniformly mixed with stars in the
diffuse interstellar medium), and a lower contribution from a ""birth cloud""
component (near-spherical dust shells surrounding young stars in H II regions)
than that of face-on galaxies. The difference is caused by the larger
path-lengths through disks at higher inclinations.

fundamental assumptions about which primitive operations are realizable. The
consensus is that these include logical operations like conjunction,
disjunction and negation, as well as reading and writing to memory locations.
This perspective conforms to a macro-level view of physics and indeed these
operations are realizable using macro-level devices involving thousands of
electrons. This point of view is however incompatible with quantum mechanics,
or even elementary thermodynamics, as both imply that information is a
conserved quantity of physical processes, and hence of primitive computational
operations.
  Our aim is to re-develop foundational computational models that embraces the
principle of conservation of information. We first define what conservation of
information means in a computational setting. We emphasize that computations
must be reversible transformations on data. One can think of data as modeled
using topological spaces and programs as modeled by reversible deformations. We
illustrate this idea using three notions of data. The first assumes
unstructured finite data, i.e., discrete topological spaces. The corresponding
notion of reversible computation is that of permutations. We then consider a
structured notion of data based on the Curry-Howard correspondence; here
reversible deformations, as a programming language for witnessing type
isomorphisms, comes from proof terms for commutative semirings. We then ""move
up a level"" to treat programs as data. The corresponding notion of reversible
programs equivalences comes from the ""higher dimensional"" analog to commutative
semirings: symmetric rig groupoids. The coherence laws for these are exactly
the program equivalences we seek.
  We conclude with some generalizations inspired by homotopy type theory and
survey directions for further research.

of error rates corresponding to different attack algorithms. A common approach
is to take the maximum across this list and compare defenses against that error
rate. We argue that a better approach is to use attack bundling: the max should
be taken across many examples at the level of individual examples, then the
error rate should be calculated by averaging after this maximization operation.
Reporting the bundled attacker error rate provides a lower bound on the true
worst-case error rate. The traditional approach of reporting the maximum error
rate across attacks can underestimate the true worst-case error rate by an
amount approaching 100\% as the number of attacks approaches infinity. Attack
bundling can be used with different prioritization schemes to optimize
quantities such as error rate on adversarial examples, perturbation size needed
to cause misclassification, or failure rate when using a specific confidence

popular neural networks are trained for end-to-end mapping, driven by big data,
our novel neural network is intended for end-to-process mapping so that

$d=2,3$ from a system of $N$ extended charges. Secondly, we prove a rigorous
quasineutral limit for initial data that are perturbations of analytic data,
deriving the Kinetic Isothermal Euler (KIE) system from the VPME system in

the Pan-STARRS1 survey in 2013. The outburst occurred in the nucleus of the
galaxy SDSS J222153.87+003054.2 at $z = 0.12355$, which was classified as a
Seyfert 2 in a pre-outburst archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectrum.
PS1-13cbe showed the appearance of strong broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission
lines and a non-stellar continuum in a Magellan spectrum taken 57 days after
the peak of the outburst that resembled the characteristics of a Seyfert 1.
These broad lines were not present in the SDSS spectrum taken a decade earlier
and faded away within two years, as observed in several late-time MDM spectra.
We argue that the dramatic appearance and disappearance of the broad lines and
factor of $\sim 8$ increase in the optical continuum is most likely caused by
variability in the pre-existing accretion disk than a tidal disruption event,
supernova, or variable obscuration. The timescale for the turn-on of the
optical emission of $\sim 70$ days observed in this transient is among the
shortest observed in a ""changing look"" active galactic nucleus.

Hip fractures are also the most commonly missed diagnosis on pelvic
radiographs. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) algorithms have shown promise for
helping radiologists detect fractures, but the image features underpinning
their predictions are notoriously difficult to understand. In this study, we
trained deep learning models on 17,587 radiographs to classify fracture, five
patient traits, and 14 hospital process variables. All 20 variables could be
predicted from a radiograph (p < 0.05), with the best performances on scanner
model (AUC=1.00), scanner brand (AUC=0.98), and whether the order was marked
""priority"" (AUC=0.79). Fracture was predicted moderately well from the image
(AUC=0.78) and better when combining image features with patient data
(AUC=0.86, p=2e-9) or patient data plus hospital process features (AUC=0.91,
p=1e-21). The model performance on a test set with matched patient variables
was significantly lower than a random test set (AUC=0.67, p=0.003); and when
the test set was matched on patient and image acquisition variables, the model
performed randomly (AUC=0.52, 95% CI 0.46-0.58), indicating that these
variables were the main source of the model's predictive ability overall. We
also used Naive Bayes to combine evidence from image models with patient and
hospital data and found their inclusion improved performance, but that this
approach was nevertheless inferior to directly modeling all variables. If CAD
algorithms are inexplicably leveraging patient and process variables in their
predictions, it is unclear how radiologists should interpret their predictions
in the context of other known patient data. Further research is needed to
illuminate deep learning decision processes so that computers and clinicians

relativistic effect, i.e., the Doppler factor due to the fast spin of the

the travel times depending on the position of the spots. For this purpose,
first we derive the basic equations with the general expression of the metric
for the static, spherically symmetric spacetime, where for simplicity we adopt
the pointlike spot approximation for the antipodal spots associated with the
magnetic polar cap model. Then, we calculate the light curves from the neutron
star models in general relativity, with various angle between rotational and
magnetic axes and the inclination angle. As the results, unlike the case for a
slowly rotating stellar model, we find that the light curve from a fast
rotating stellar model depends not only the stellar compactness but also the
stellar radius. We also find that the amplitude of the light curve becomes
larger as the stellar radius increases and as the stellar compactness
decreases. Thus, via careful observations of the light curves from the rotating
neutron star, one would determine the stellar compactness together with the
stellar radius, if it rotates fast enough.

the reconstructed field properties is still not fully understood. To quantify
this, we use 3D non-potential magnetic field simulations for slowly rotating
solar-like stars as inputs to test the capabilities of ZDI. These simulations
are based on a flux transport model connected to a non-potential coronal
evolution model using the observed solar flux emergence pattern. We first
compare four field prescriptions regarding their reconstruction capabilities
and investigate the influence of the spatial resolution of the input maps on
the corresponding circularly polarised profiles. We then generate circularly
polarised spectra based on our high resolution simulations of three stellar
models with different activity levels, and reconstruct their large-scale
magnetic fields using a non-potential ZDI code assuming two different stellar
inclination angles. Our results show that the ZDI technique reconstructs the
main features of slowly rotating solar-like stars but with $\sim\,$one order of
magnitude less magnetic energy. The large-scale field morphologies are
recovered up to harmonic modes $\ell \sim 5$, especially after averaging over
several maps for each stellar model. While ZDI is not able to reproduce the
input magnetic energy distributions across individual harmonic modes, the
fractional energies across the modes are generally within $20\,\%$ agreement.
The fraction of axisymmetric and toroidal field tends to be overestimated for
stars with solar flux emergence patterns for more pole-on inclination angles.

scatter at low and high stellar masses to stellar and active galactic nuclei
feed-back respectively. However, measuring $\sigma_{\mathrm{sSFR}}$ and the
shape of the $\sigma_{\mathrm{sSFR}}$-M$_{*}$ relation is problematic and can
vary dramatically depending on the sample selected, chosen separation of
passive/star-forming systems, and method of deriving star-formation rates
($i.e.$ H$\alpha$ emission vs spectral energy distribution fitting). As such,
any astrophysical conclusions drawn from measurements of
$\sigma_{\mathrm{sSFR}}$ must consider these dependencies. Here we use the
Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey to explore how $\sigma_{\mathrm{sSFR}}$ varies
with SFR indicator for a variety of selections for disc-like `main sequence'
star-forming galaxies including colour, star-formation rate, visual morphology,
bulge-to-total mass ratio, S\'{e}rsic index and mixture modelling. We find that
irrespective of sample selection and/or SFR indicator, the dispersion along the
sSFR-M$_{*}$ relation does follow a 'U'-shaped distribution. This suggests that
the shape is physical and not an artefact of sample selection or method. We
then compare the $\sigma_{\mathrm{sSFR}}$-M$_{*}$ relation to state-of-the-art
hydrodynamical and semi-analytic models and find good agreement with our
observed results. Finally, we find that for group satellites this 'U'-shaped

vaporization is a mixing-controlled equilibrium process. A liquid-jet model and
a gas-jet model are also intro-duced to improve grid-independency. In the
current study, the EP model is applied in simulations of multi-hole gasoline
direct injection (GDI). The model is validated at ambient densities from 3 to 9
kg/m3 and ambient temperatures from 400 K to 900 K, for two different GDI
injectors, i.e. the Engine Combustion Network (ECN) Spray G injector and a GM
injector. Iso-octane is used as the surrogate in consistency with available
experi-ments. The results show good agreement in terms of liquid/vapor
penetration, shape of the vapor envelope, and the velocity evolution along the
injector centerline. Then, a 10-component gasoline surrogate fuel is used to
demonstrate the capability of this model for multi-component spray simulations,
which is essential for engine combustion and emission predictions.

the past two decades of distributed systems security research. However, the
converse is increasingly true. Routing and path decisions are now important for
the security properties of systems built on top of the Internet. In particular,
BGP poisoning leverages the de facto routing protocol between Autonomous
Systems (ASes) to maneuver the return paths of upstream networks onto
previously unusable, new paths. These new paths can be used to avoid
congestion, censors, geo-political boundaries, or any feature of the topology
which can be expressed at an AS-level. Given the increase in BGP poisoning
usage as a security primitive, we set out to evaluate poisoning feasibility in
practice beyond simulation.
  To that end, using an Internet-scale measurement infrastructure, we capture
and analyze over 1,400 instances of BGP poisoning across thousands of ASes as a
mechanism to maneuver return paths of traffic. We analyze in detail the
performance of steering paths, the graph-theoretic aspects of available paths,
and re-evaluate simulated systems with this data. We find that the real-world
evidence does not completely support the findings from simulated systems
published in the literature. We also analyze filtering of BGP poisoning across
types of ASes and ISP working groups. We explore the connectivity concerns when
poisoning by reproducing a decade old experiment to uncover the current state
of an Internet triple the size. We build predictive models for understanding an
ASes' vulnerability to poisoning. Finally, an exhaustive measurement of an
upper bound on the maximum path length of the Internet is presented, detailing
how security research should react to ASes leveraging poisoned long paths. In
total, our results and analysis expose the real-world impact of BGP poisoning
on past and future security research.

  sampling",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a fixed $n\times d$ matrix $\mathbf{X}$, where $n\gg d$, we study the
complexity of sampling from a distribution over all subsets of rows where the
probability of a subset is proportional to the squared volume of the
parallelepiped spanned by the rows (a.k.a. a determinantal point process). In
this task, it is important to minimize the preprocessing cost of the procedure
(performed once) as well as the sampling cost (performed repeatedly). To that
end, we propose a new determinantal point process algorithm which has the
following two properties, both of which are novel: (1) a preprocessing step
which runs in time $O(\text{number-of-non-zeros}(\mathbf{X})\cdot\log
n)+\text{poly}(d)$, and (2) a sampling step which runs in $\text{poly}(d)$
time, independent of the number of rows $n$. We achieve this by introducing a
new regularized determinantal point process (R-DPP), which serves as an
intermediate distribution in the sampling procedure by reducing the number of
rows from $n$ to $\text{poly}(d)$. Crucially, this intermediate distribution
does not distort the probabilities of the target sample. Our key novelty in
defining the R-DPP is the use of a Poisson random variable for controlling the
probabilities of different subset sizes, leading to new determinantal formulas
such as the normalization constant for this distribution. Our algorithm has
applications in many diverse areas where determinantal point processes have
been used, such as machine learning, stochastic optimization, data
summarization and low-rank matrix reconstruction.

define two types of non-Markovian processes, depending on the required memory
being classical or quantum. We formalise this distinction using the process
matrix formalism, through which a process is represented as a multipartite

to a test for quantum memory in the corresponding process. This allows us to
apply separability criteria and entanglement witnesses to the detection of

the H$\alpha$ velocity, which lasts for 12 minutes and is associated with the
H$\alpha$ line wing enhancements. Two mini jets appear upon the bright fronts
of the fan shape jets visible in the AIA 171 {\AA} and 193 {\AA} channels, with
a time interval as short as 1 minute. Two kinds of small scale convective

convection cell and the other manifests as the motion of a dark lane passing
through the convection cell. The finding of three lobes Stokes V profiles and
their inversion with NICOLE code indicates that there is magnetic field lines

  Security-Through-Obscurity Defenses",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of finding a universal (image-agnostic) perturbation to
fool machine learning (ML) classifiers (e.g., neural nets, decision tress) in
the hard-label black-box setting. Recent work in adversarial ML in the
white-box setting (model parameters are known) has shown that many
state-of-the-art image classifiers are vulnerable to universal adversarial
perturbations: a fixed human-imperceptible perturbation that, when added to any
image, causes it to be misclassified with high probability Kurakin et al.
[2016], Szegedy et al. [2013], Chen et al. [2017a], Carlini and Wagner [2017].
This paper considers a more practical and challenging problem of finding such
universal perturbations in an obscure (or black-box) setting. More
specifically, we use zeroth order optimization algorithms to find such a
universal adversarial perturbation when no model information is revealed-except
that the attacker can make queries to probe the classifier. We further relax
the assumption that the output of a query is continuous valued confidence
scores for all the classes and consider the case where the output is a
hard-label decision. Surprisingly, we found that even in these extremely
obscure regimes, state-of-the-art ML classifiers can be fooled with a very high
probability just by adding a single human-imperceptible image perturbation to
any natural image. The surprising existence of universal perturbations in a
hard-label black-box setting raises serious security concerns with the
existence of a universal noise vector that adversaries can possibly exploit to
break a classifier on most natural images.

quantitatively the role of social contacts in contagion dynamics. In general,
there are two types of contacts: close ones among friends, colleagues and
family members, etc., and ordinary contacts from encounters with strangers.
Typically, social reinforcement occurs for close contacts. Taking into account
both types of contacts, we develop a contact-based model for social contagion.
We find that, associated with the spreading dynamics, for random networks there
is coexistence of continuous and discontinuous phase transitions, but for
heterogeneous networks the transition is continuous. We also find that ordinary
contacts play a crucial role in promoting large scale spreading, and the number
of close contacts determines not only the nature of the phase transitions but
also the value of the outbreak threshold in random networks. For heterogeneous
networks from the real world, the abundance of close contacts affects the
epidemic threshold, while its role in facilitating the spreading depends on the
adoption threshold assigned to it. We uncover two striking phenomena. First, a
strong interplay between ordinary and close contacts is necessary for
generating prevalent spreading. In fact, only when there are propagation paths
of reasonable length which involve both close and ordinary contacts are large
scale outbreaks of social contagions possible. Second, abundant close contacts
in heterogeneous networks promote both outbreak and spreading of the contagion
through the transmission channels among the hubs, when both values of the
threshold and transmission rate among ordinary contacts are small. We develop a
theoretical framework to obtain an analytic understanding of the main findings
on random networks, with support from extensive numerical computations.

attention to evasion against text and graph-based detectors, but evasions
against behavior-based detectors are largely ignored, leading to
vulnerabilities in spam detection systems. Since real evasion data are scarce,
we first propose EMERAL (Evasion via Maximum Entropy and Rating sAmpLing) to
generate evasive spams to certain existing detectors. EMERAL can simulate
spammers with different goals and levels of knowledge about the detectors,
targeting at different stages of the life cycle of target products. We show
that in the evasion-defense dynamic, only a few evasion types are meaningful to
the spammers, and any spammer will not be able to evade too many detection
signals at the same time. We reveal that some evasions are quite insidious and
can fail all detection signals. We then propose DETER (Defense via Evasion

generated by EMERAL. Experiments confirm that DETER is more accurate in
detecting both suspicious time window and individual spamming reviews. In terms

imitate decision making process during fleet operation, which combines
real-time optimization with artificial intelligence. The agents are capable of
inferring enemy's future move based on historical data and optimize

utility in many modern HPC applications including scientific simulations, data

traditional benchmarking tools like STREAM, STRIDE, and GUPS focus on
characterizing only uniform stride or fully random accesses despite evidence
that modern applications use varied sets of more complex access patterns.
  Spatter is an open-source benchmark that provides a tunable and configurable
framework to benchmark a variety of indexed access patterns, including
variations of gather/scatter that are seen in HPC mini-apps evaluated in this

experiments show how it can be used to evaluate 1) uniform access patterns for

roughly speaking, it is close in total variation distance to a small shift of
it in any direction. Shift-invariance relaxes smoothness assumptions commonly
used in non-parametric density estimation to allow jump discontinuities. The
different classes of distributions that we consider correspond to different
rates of tail decay.
  For each such class we give an efficient algorithm that learns any
distribution in the class from independent samples with respect to total
variation distance. As a special case of our general result, we show that
$d$-dimensional shift-invariant distributions which satisfy an exponential tail
bound can be learned to total variation distance error $\epsilon$ using
$\tilde{O}_d(1/ \epsilon^{d+2})$ examples and $\tilde{O}_d(1/ \epsilon^{2d+2})$
time. This implies that, for constant $d$, multivariate log-concave
distributions can be learned in $\tilde{O}_d(1/\epsilon^{2d+2})$ time using
$\tilde{O}_d(1/\epsilon^{d+2})$ samples, answering a question of [Diakonikolas,
Kane and Stewart, 2016] All of our results extend to a model of noise-tolerant
density estimation using Huber's contamination model, in which the target
distribution to be learned is a $(1-\epsilon,\epsilon)$ mixture of some unknown
distribution in the class with some other arbitrary and unknown distribution,
and the learning algorithm must output a hypothesis distribution with total
variation distance error $O(\epsilon)$ from the target distribution. We show
that our general results are close to best possible by proving a simple
$\Omega\left(1/\epsilon^d\right)$ information-theoretic lower bound on sample
complexity even for learning bounded distributions that are shift-invariant.

zero degrees. A sliding mode controller was used as a position controller. We
found it possible to control multiple degrees of freedom; however, we found

therefore the position of the motor point of the middle finger deviates from

Because the approaches of the methods differ and have their own limitations, we
think that a number of verification methods should be applied to a developed
DNN. To apply a number of methods to the DNN, it is necessary to translate
either the implementation of the DNN or the verification method so that one
runs in the same environment as the other. Since those translations are
time-consuming, a utility tool, named DeepSaucer, which helps to retain and
reuse implementations of DNNs, verification methods, and their environments, is
proposed. In DeepSaucer, code snippets of loading DNNs, running verification
methods, and creating their environments are retained and reused as software
assets in order to reduce cost of verifying DNNs. The feasibility of DeepSaucer
is confirmed by implementing it on the basis of Anaconda, which provides
virtual environment for loading a DNN and running a verification method. In
addition, the effectiveness of DeepSaucer is demonstrated by usecase examples.

function $c_b(a)$ describing the problem of symplectically embedding an

determined for all integers $b \geq 2.$ As in McDuff's work,
Cristofaro-Gardiner, Frenkel, and Schlenk found staircases associated with the
embedding function. More recently, Usher's work shows that the appearance of
infinite staircases as $b$ varies is hard to predict. The intricate structure
found there suggests that determining the entirety of the graph of $c_b(a)$ for
all $b$ is intractable.
  In contrast with this result, we show that for every polydisc $P(1,b)$ with
$b>2$, there is an explicit formula for the minimum $a$ such that the embedding
problem is determined only by volume. That is, when the ellipsoid is
sufficiently stretched, there is a symplectic embedding of $E(1,a)$ fully
filling an appropriately scaled polydisc $P(\lambda,\lambda b)$. We call this
value of $a$ the rigid-flexible value at $b$, or the RF-value. This formula is
piecewise smooth in $b$.
  To further describe the function $RF(b)$, we investigate its behavior as
$b\to 1$. Frenkel and M\""{u}ller showed that the $RF$-value at $b=1$ is $7
\frac{1}{32}$ and Cristofaro-Gardiner, Frenkel, and Schlenk showed that the

importance-based attention sampling can be confirmed during temporal

process, may send arbitrary incorrect messages to the master due to data
corruptions, communication failures or malicious attacks, and consequently bias
the learned model. The key to the proposed methods is a regularization term
incorporated with the objective function so as to robustify the learning task
and mitigate the negative effects of Byzantine attacks. The resultant
subgradient-based algorithms are termed Byzantine-Robust Stochastic Aggregation

existing algorithms, RSA does not rely on the assumption that the data are
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) on the workers, and hence fits
for a wider class of applications. Theoretically, we show that: i) RSA
converges to a near-optimal solution with the learning error dependent on the
number of Byzantine workers; ii) the convergence rate of RSA under Byzantine
attacks is the same as that of the stochastic gradient descent method, which is
free of Byzantine attacks. Numerically, experiments on real dataset corroborate
the competitive performance of RSA and a complexity reduction compared to the
state-of-the-art alternatives.

pruning modules derived from the approximation of bias and variance. These rule
adaptation methods have no reliance on user-defined thresholds, thereby
increasing the PAC's autonomy for real-time deployment. PAC adapts the
consequent parameters with the sliding mode control (SMC) theory in the
single-pass fashion. The boundedness and convergence of the closed-loop control
system's tracking error and the controller's consequent parameters are
confirmed by utilizing the LaSalle-Yoshizawa theorem. Lastly, the controller's
efficacy is evaluated by observing various trajectory tracking performance from
a bio-inspired flapping-wing micro aerial vehicle (BI-FWMAV) and a rotary wing
micro aerial vehicle called hexacopter. Furthermore, it is compared to three
distinctive controllers. Our PAC outperforms the linear PID controller and
feed-forward neural network (FFNN) based nonlinear adaptive controller.
Compared to its predecessor, G-controller, the tracking accuracy is comparable,

performance than the G-controller.

credence as a Dark Matter (DM) candidate that explains the dark cores of dwarf

generic in String Theory, with multiple light axions predicted in this context.
We examine the possibility of soliton structures over a wide range of scales,
accounting for galaxy core masses and the common presence of nuclear star
clusters. We present a diagnostic soliton core mass-radius plot that provides a

  Analysis","This paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nonlinear modal decoupling (NMD) was recently proposed to nonlinearly
transform a multi-oscillator system into a number of decoupled oscillators
which together behave the same as the original system in an extended
neighborhood of the equilibrium. Each oscillator has just one degree of freedom
and hence can easily be analyzed to infer the stability of the original system
associated with one electromechanical mode. As the first attempt of applying
the NMD methodology to realistic power system models, this paper proposes an
NMD-based transient stability analysis approach. For a multi-machine power
system, the approach first derives decoupled nonlinear oscillators by a
coordinates transformation, and then applies Lyapunov stability analysis to
oscillators to assess the stability of the original system. Nonlinear modal
interaction is also considered. The approach can be efficiently applied to a
large-scale power grid by conducting NMD regarding only selected modes. Case
studies on a 3-machine 9-bus system and an NPCC 48-machine 140-bus system show
the potentials of the approach in transient stability analysis for

Compressive Sensing (CS) has proven to be an efficient technique for

premise of reconstructing an image from an incompletely filled k-space, leads
to an ill-posed inverse problem. In the past years, lots of efforts have been
made to efficiently optimize the CS-MRI model. Inspired by deep learning
techniques, some preliminary works have tried to incorporate deep architectures
into CS-MRI process. Unfortunately, the convergence issues (due to the
experience-based networks) and the robustness (i.e., lack real-world noise
modeling) of these deeply trained optimization methods are still missing. In
this work, we develop a new paradigm to integrate designed numerical solvers

condition checking mechanism, we can successfully prove the convergence of our
established deep CS-MRI optimization scheme. Furthermore, we explicitly
formulate the Rician noise distributions within our framework and obtain an

Extensive experimental results verify that the proposed paradigm outperforms

efficiency as well as robustness to noises in real scene.

by the norm-conserving pseudopotential and GGA are in excellent agreement with
experimental data. Our studies reveal that norm-conserving pseudopotentials
with GGA exchange-correlations provide much improvement for the prediction of
the electronic properties of TiO2. We observed that, using LDA and ultrasoft
pseudopotential is an excellent combination to describe the vibrational

exploring the resultant modulation of novel properties on solid surfaces.
However, the mechanism, especially its effect on the oxygen migration and
electrostatic charging at the oxide heterostructures, is still unclear. Here we
explore the electrolyte gating on oxygen-deficient interfaces between SrTiO3
(STO) crystals and LaAlO3 (LAO) overlayer through the measurements of
electrical transport, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and photoluminescence
(PL) spectra. We found that oxygen vacancies (Ovac) were filled selectively and
irreversibly after gating due to oxygen electromigration at the amorphous
LAO/STO interface, resulting in a reconstruction of its interfacial band
structure. Because of the filling of Ovac, the amorphous interface also showed
an enhanced electron mobility and quantum oscillation of the conductance.
Further, the filling effect could be controlled by the degree of the
crystallinity of the LAO overlayer by varying the growth temperatures. Our
results reveal the different effects induced by electrolyte gating, providing
further clues to understand the mechanism of electrolyte gating on buried
interfaces and also opening a new avenue for constructing high-mobility oxide
interfaces.

between entities, and plays an essential role in information extraction,

individually, while ignoring implicit global clues available across different
entity pairs and in the knowledge base, which often leads to conflicts among
local predictions from different entity pairs. This paper proposes a joint
inference framework that employs such global clues to resolve disagreements
among local predictions. We exploit two kinds of clues to generate constraints
which can capture the implicit type and cardinality requirements of a relation.
Those constraints can be examined in either hard style or soft style, both of
which can be effectively explored in an integer linear program formulation.
Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets show that our
proposed framework can effectively utilize those two categories of global clues
and resolve the disagreements among local predictions, thus improve various
relation extractors when such clues are applicable to the datasets. Our
experiments also indicate that the clues learnt automatically from existing
knowledge bases perform comparably to or better than those refined by human.

it can be found that the structural parameters have greater effects on thermal

parameters are selected to optimize the thermal performance of the heat sink,

of the Lorentz symmetry is actually present in the theory, and that the choice
of an Erhesmann connection to describe the gauge field makes the translations
difficult to implement (mainly because there is in general no principal

numerous physical phenomena. We seek to understand macroscopically observed
static and sliding contact behavior as the collective response of a large
number of microscopic asperities. We develop an efficient numerical framework
that can be used to investigate how the macroscopic response of multiple
frictional contacts depends on long-range elastic interactions, different
constitutive assumptions about the deforming contacts and their local shear
resistance, and surface roughness. We approximate the contact between two rough
surfaces as that between a regular array of discrete deformable elements
attached to a elastic block and a rigid rough surface. The deformable elements
are viscoelastic or elasto/viscoplastic with a range of relaxation times, and
the elastic interaction between contacts is long-range. We find that the model
reproduces main macroscopic features of evolution of contact and friction for a
range of constitutive models of the elements, suggesting that macroscopic
frictional response is robust with respect to the microscopic behavior.
Viscoelasticity/viscoplasticity contributes to the increase of friction with
contact time and leads to a subtle history dependence. Interestingly,
long-range elastic interactions only change the results quantitatively compared
to the meanfield response. We find that sustained increase in the static
friction coefficient during long hold times suggests viscoelastic response of
the underlying material with multiple relaxation time scales. We also find that
the experimentally observed proportionality of the direct effect in velocity
jump experiments to the logarithm of the velocity jump points to a complex
material-dependent shear resistance at the microscale.

3C~273 are still poorly understood. We report a new, high signal-to-noise,
reverberation mapping campaign carried out from November 2008 to March 2018
that allows the determination of time lags between emission lines and the
variable continuum with high precision. The time lag of variations in H$\beta$
relative to those of the 5100 Angstrom continuum is $146.8_{-12.1}^{+8.3}$ days
in the rest frame, which agrees very well with the Paschen-$\alpha$ region
measured by the GRAVITY at The Very Large Telescope Interferometer. The time
lag of the H$\gamma$ emission line is found to be nearly the same as for
H$\beta$. The lag of the Fe II emission is $322.0_{-57.9}^{+55.5}$ days, longer
by a factor of $\sim$2 than that of the Balmer lines. The velocity-resolved lag
measurements of the H$\beta$ line show a complex structure which can be
possibly explained by a rotation-dominated disk with some inflowing radial
velocity in the H$\beta$-emitting region. Taking the virial factor of $f_{\rm
BLR} = 1.3$, we derive a BH mass of $M_{\bullet} = 4.1_{-0.4}^{+0.3} \times
10^8 M_{\odot}$ and an accretion rate of $9.3\,L_{\rm Edd}\,c^{-2}$ from the
H$\beta$ line. The decomposition of its $HST$ images yields a host stellar mass
of $M_* = 10^{11.3 \pm 0.7} M_\odot$, and a ratio of $M_{\bullet}/M_*\approx
2.0\times 10^{-3}$ in agreement with the Magorrian relation. In the near
future, it is expected to compare the geometrically-thick BLR discovered by the
GRAVITY in 3C 273 with its spatially-resolved torus in order to understand the
potential connection between the BLR and the torus.

tensors that are interconnected through the summation of auxiliary indices. The
decomposition is stable, has a well-defined notion of rank and enables the user
to perform various linear algebra operations on vectors and matrices of
exponential size in a computationally efficient manner. The tensor ring
decomposition replaces the train by a ring through the introduction of one
additional auxiliary variable. This article discusses a major issue with the
tensor ring decomposition: its inability to compute an exact minimal-rank
decomposition from a decomposition with sub-optimal ranks. Both the contraction
operation and Hadamard product are motivated from applications and it is shown
through simple examples how the tensor ring-rounding procedure fails to
retrieve minimal-rank decompositions with these operations. These observations,
together with the already known issue of not being able to find a best low-rank
tensor ring approximation to a given tensor indicate that the applicability of
tensor rings is severely limited.

estimates the 3D poses of objects from a monocular image, which approximates
where to examine further, and derives multiple candidates that are
geometrically feasible. This step significantly narrows down feasible 3D
regions, which otherwise requires demanding processing of 3D point clouds in a
huge search space. Then the second part, RoarNet_3D, takes the candidate
regions and conducts in-depth inferences to conclude final poses in a recursive
manner. Inspired by PointNet, RoarNet_3D processes 3D point clouds directly
without any loss of data, leading to precise detection. We evaluate our method
in KITTI, a 3D object detection benchmark. Our result shows that RoarNet has
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods that are publicly available.
Remarkably, RoarNet also outperforms state-of-the-art methods even in settings
where Lidar and camera are not time synchronized, which is practically
important for actual driving environments. RoarNet is implemented in Tensorflow

achieved by assuming that the price of crude oil reacts to stock market

Stackelberg security games. As opposed to the weak Stackelberg equilibrium
(WSE), the SSE assumes that the follower breaks ties in favor of the leader and
this is widely acknowledged and justified by the assertion that the defender
can often induce the attacker to choose a preferred action by making an
infinitesimal adjustment to her strategy. Unfortunately, in security games with
resource assignment constraints, the assertion might not be valid; it is
possible that the defender cannot induce the desired outcome. As a result, many
results claimed in the literature may be overly optimistic. To remedy, we first
formally define the utility guarantee of a defender strategy and provide
examples to show that the utility of SSE can be higher than its utility
guarantee. Second, inspired by the analysis of leader's payoff by Von Stengel
and Zamir (2004), we provide the solution concept called the inducible
Stackelberg equilibrium (ISE), which owns the highest utility guarantee and
always exists. Third, we show the conditions when ISE coincides with SSE and
the fact that in general case, SSE can be extremely worse with respect to
utility guarantee. Moreover, introducing the ISE does not invalidate existing
algorithmic results as the problem of computing an ISE polynomially reduces to
that of computing an SSE. We also provide an algorithmic implementation for
computing ISE, with which our experiments unveil the empirical advantage of the
ISE over the SSE.

operator insertion, the path integral reduces to a finite-dimensional residue
integral. The operator insertion automatically determines a choice of integral
contours, leading to the Jeffrey-Kirwan residue formula. This result ensures
the existence of the solution to the BPS vortex equation and explains the
Bradlow bounds of the BPS vortex. We also discuss a generating function of the
volume of the vortex moduli space and show a reduction of the moduli space from

content, whereas for advertisement and educational purposes it is often
crucial. Despite numerous studies on understanding and predicting image
memorability, there are almost no achievements in memorability modification. In
this work, we study two approaches to image editing - GAN and classical image
processing - and show their impact on memorability. The visual features which
influence memorability directly stay unknown till now, hence it is impossible
to control it manually. As a solution, we let GAN learn it deeply using labeled
data, and then use it for conditional generation of new images. By analogy with
algorithms which edit facial attributes, we consider memorability as yet
another attribute and operate with it in the same way. Obtained data is also
interesting for analysis, simply because there are no real-world examples of
successful change of image memorability while preserving its other attributes.
We believe this may give many new answers to the question ""what makes an image
memorable?"" Apart from that we also study the influence of conventional
photo-editing tools (Photoshop, Instagram, etc.) used daily by a wide audience
on memorability. In this case, we start from real practical methods and study
it using statistics and recent advances in memorability prediction.
Photographers, designers, and advertisers will benefit from the results of this
study directly.

is applicable to unconstrained problems and to problems with inexpensive
constraints (that is constraints whose evaluation and enforcement has
negligible cost) under the assumption that the derivative of highest degree is
$\beta$-H\""{o}lder continuous. It features a very flexible adaptive mechanism
for determining the inexactness which is allowed, at each iteration, when
computing objective function values and derivatives. The complexity analysis
covers arbitrary optimality order and arbitrary degree of available approximate
derivatives. It extends results of Cartis, Gould and Toint (2018) on the
evaluation complexity to the inexact case: if a $q$th order minimizer is sought
using approximations to the first $p$ derivatives, it is proved that a suitable
approximate minimizer within $\epsilon$ is computed by the proposed algorithm
in at most $O(\epsilon^{-\frac{p+\beta}{p-q+\beta}})$ iterations and at most
$O(|\log(\epsilon)|\epsilon^{-\frac{p+\beta}{p-q+\beta}})$ approximate
evaluations. An algorithmic variant, although more rigid in practice, can be
proved to find such an approximate minimizer in
$O(|\log(\epsilon)|+\epsilon^{-\frac{p+\beta}{p-q+\beta}})$ evaluations.While
the proposed framework remains so far conceptual for high degrees and orders,
it is shown to yield simple and computationally realistic inexact methods when
specialized to the unconstrained and bound-constrained first- and second-order
cases. The deterministic complexity results are finally extended to the
stochastic context, yielding adaptive sample-size rules for subsampling methods

is defined as follows: given a graph $G$, an integer $k$, and a target $\tau$,
is there a set $S$ of $k$ vertices that can be deleted, so that $H(G - S)$ is
at most $\tau$? In this paper, we consider the MinH problem on trees.
  We call $H$ ""balanced on trees"" if, whenever $G$ is a tree, there is an
optimal choice of $S$ such that the components of $G-S$ have sizes bounded by a
polynomial in $n/k$. We show that MinH on trees is FPT for parameter $n/k$, and
furthermore, can be solved in subexponential time, and polynomial space, if $H$
is additive, balanced on trees, and computable in polynomial time.
  A measure of interest is the Inverse Geodesic Length (IGL), which is used to
gauge the connectedness of a graph. It is defined as the sum of inverse
distances between every two vertices: $IGL(G)=\sum_{\{u,v\} \subseteq V}
\frac{1}{d_G(u,v)}$. While MinIGL is W[1]-hard for parameter treewidth, and
cannot be solved in $2^{o(k+n+m)}$ time, even on bipartite graphs with $n$

trees. We show that IGL is balanced on trees, to give a $2^{O((n\log

  The distance distribution of $G$ is the sequence $\{a_i\}$ describing the
number of vertex pairs distance $i$ apart in $G$: $a_i=|\{\{u, v\}: d_G(u,
v)=i\}|$. We show that the distance distribution of a tree can be computed in
$O(n\log^2 n)$ time by reduction to polynomial multiplication. We extend our
result to graphs with small treewidth by showing that the first $p$ values of
the distance distribution can be computed in $2^{O(tw(G))} n^{1+\varepsilon}

electron-transfer (ET) processes in condensed media. It establishes the
simplest conceptual test bed to study the influence of the medium's dynamics on
ET kinetics both on the ensemble level, and on the level of single particles.
Single electron description is particularly important for nanoscale systems.
Slow medium's dynamics is capable to enslave ET and bring it on the ensemble
level from a quantum regime of non-adiabatic tunneling to the classical
adiabatic regime, where electrons just follow the nuclei rearrangements. This
classical adiabatic textbook picture contradicts, however, in a very
spectacular fashion to the statistics of single electron transitions, even in
the Debye, memoryless media, named also Ohmic in the parlance of the famed
spin-boson model. On the single particle level, ET remains always quantum and
this was named a quantum breaking of ergodicity in the adiabatic ET regime.
What happens in the case of subdiffusive, fractional, or sub-Ohmic medium's
dynamics, which is featured by power-law decaying dynamical memory effects
pertinent e.g. for protein macromolecules, and other viscoelastic media? Such a
memory is vividly manifested by anomalous Cole-Cole dielectric response typical
for such media. This is the question which is addressed in this work based both
on precise numerics and analytical semi-classical theory. The ensemble theory
remarkably agrees with the numerical dynamics of electronic populations,
revealing a power law relaxation tail even in a deeply non-adiabatic electron
transfer regime. However, a profound difference with the numerically accurate
results emerges for the distribution of residence times in the electronic
states, both on the ensemble level and on the level of single trajectories.
Ergodicity is broken dynamically even in a more spectacular way than in the
memoryless case.

be reduced to End-of-Potential-Line. This problem merges the canonical
PPAD-complete problem End-of-Line, with the canonical PLS-complete problem
Sink-of-Dag, and so EOPL captures problems that can be solved by a
line-following algorithm that also simultaneously decreases a potential
function.
  Promise-UEOPL is a promise-subclass of EOPL in which the line in the
End-of-Potential-Line instance is guaranteed to be unique via a promise. We
turn this into a non-promise class UEOPL, by adding an extra solution type to
EOPL that captures any pair of points that are provably on two different lines.
  We show that UEOPL $\subseteq$ EOPL $\subseteq$ CLS, and that all of our

finding a fixpoint of a Piecewise-Linear Contraction under an $\ell_p$-norm all
lie in UEOPL. Our results also imply that parity games, mean-payoff games,
discounted games, and simple-stochastic games lie in UEOPL.
  All of our containment results are proved via a reduction to a problem that
we call One-Permutation Discrete Contraction (OPDC). This problem is motivated
by a discretized version of contraction, but it is also closely related to the

and coworkers to evaluate the $_\Lambda^3$H lifetime, using $_\Lambda^3$H

disregarding pion final-state interaction (FSI), is $\tau({_\Lambda^3}{\rm

found attractive, reducing further $\tau({_\Lambda^3}{\rm H})$ to
$\tau({_\Lambda^3}{\rm H})$=(0.81$\pm$0.02)$\tau_\Lambda$. We also evaluate for
the first time $\tau({_\Lambda^3}{\rm n})$, finding it considerably longer than
$\tau_\Lambda$, contrary to the shorter lifetime values suggested by the GSI

become more and more severe in the last decades. As an effective approach,
Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been applied to urban traffic signal control
system. However, the potentially high online computation burden may limit its
further application for real scenarios. In this paper, a new approach based on
online active set strategy is proposed to improve the real-time performance of
MPC-based traffic controller by reducing the online computing time. This
approach divides one control cycle into several sequential sampling intervals.
In each interval, online active set method is applied to solve quadratic
programming (QP) of traffic signal control model, by searching the optimal
solution starting at the optimal solution of previous interval in the feasible
region. The most appealing property of this approach lies in that it can
distribute the computational complexity into several sample intervals, instead
of imposing heavy computation burden at each end of control cycle. The
simulation experiments show that this breakthrough approach can obviously
reduce the online computational complexity, and increase the applicability of
the MPC in real-life traffic networks.

Laser-induced fluorescence is used to visualize the oxygen concentration in the

The ruthenium-based fluorescent dye seems to be surface active, such that the
rise velocity is reduced by up to 50 % compared to the experiment without
fluorescent dye and a recirculation zone forms in the bubble wake. To access
the local mass transfer at the interface, we perform complementary numerical
simulations. Since the fluorescence tracer is essential for the experimental

simulation. We employ several improvements in the experimental and numerical
procedures which allow for a quantitative comparison (locally and globally).
Rise velocity and mass transfer coefficient agree within a few percents between

population synthesis models struggle to reproduce. Here we explore the effects
of the assumed stellar initial mass function (IMF) on the ionizing photon
output of young populations at wavelengths below key ionization energy
thresholds. We use a custom set of binary population and spectral synthesis
(BPASS) models to explore the effects of IMF assumptions as a function of
metallicity, IMF slope, upper mass limit, IMF power law break mass and
sampling. We find that while the flux capable of ionizing hydrogen is only
weakly dependent on IMF parameters, the photon flux responsible for the He II
and O VI lines is far more sensitive to assumptions. In our current models this
flux arises primarily from helium and Wolf-Rayet stars which have partially or
fully lost their hydrogen envelopes. The timescales for formation and evolution
of both Wolf Rayet stars and helium dwarfs, and hence inferred population age,
are affected by choice of model IMF. Even the most extreme IMFs cannot
reproduce the He II ionizing flux observed in some high redshift galaxies,
suggesting a source other than stellar photospheres. We caution that detailed
interpretation of features in an individual galaxy spectrum is inevitably going
to be subject to uncertainties in the IMF of its contributing starbursts. We
remind the community that the initial mass function is fundamentally a
statistical construct, and that stellar population synthesis models are most
effective when considering entire galaxy populations rather than individual
objects.

wave approach based on an integro-differential formulation of the

density that disentangles the geometric and material properties of the body the
integro-differential equation for the induced surface (free or polarization)
current density field is solved. The current modes and the corresponding
resonant values of the surface conductivity (eigen-conductivities) are
evaluated by solving a linear eigenvalue problem with a non-Hermitian operator.
They are inherent properties of the body geometry and do not depend on the body
material. The material only determines the coefficients of the modal expansion
and hence the frequencies at which their amplitudes are maximum (resonance
frequencies). The eigen-conductivities and the current modes are studied in
detail as the frequency, the shape and the size of the body vary. Open and
closed surfaces are considered. The presence of vortex current modes, in
addition to the source-sink current modes (no whirling modes), which
characterize plasmonic oscillations, is shown. Important topological features
of the current modes, such as the number of sources and sinks, the number of
vortexes, the direction of the vortexes are preserved as the size of the body
and the frequency vary. Unlike the source-sink current modes, in open surfaces
the vortex current modes can be resonantly excited only in materials with
positive imaginary part of the surface conductivity. Eventually, as examples,
the scattering by two-dimensional bodies with either positive or negative

energy, without assuming any specific form for the potential. By allowing the
Gaussian process to reconstruct the form of the potential from $H(z)$ data,
upper bounds on the second Swampland criterion (involving $|V^{\prime}|/V$) for
two different kernel functions (the squared exponential and Matern~($\nu =

since the upper bound of the second Swampland criterion is derived in a
thoroughly model-independent way, without resorting to a model-to-model
comparison strategy. The analysis is performed using the latest values of
$H_{0}$ reported by the Planck and Hubble missions. Results for the estimation
of the constant of $SC2$ hint towards the possibility of getting upper bounds
well behind the estimations for the dark energy dominated universe as reported
in previous studies, which involved model-to-model comparison. Estimations from
this new approach turn to be quite sensitive and just depend on the quality of
the data and on the kernel employed. This study is a first attempt towards the
exploitation of the Swampland criteria in a model-independent way and may be
extended to involve other datasets and, also, in trying to understand what is

sparse signal recovery: the problem of sparse signals that stem from finite
alphabets and the techniques that introduce concave penalties. Specifically, we
show that using a minimax concave penalty (MCP) the recovery of finite-valued
sparse signals is enhanced with respect to classical Lasso, in terms of
estimation accuracy, number of necessary measurements, and run time. We focus
on problems where sparse signals can be recovered from few linear measurements,
as stated in compressed sensing theory. We start by proposing a Lasso-kind
functional with MCP, whose minimum is the desired signal in the noise-free
case, under null space conditions. We analyze its robustness to noise as well.
We then propose an efficient ADMM-based algorithm to search the minimum. The
algorithm is proved to converge to the set of stationary points, and its
performance is evaluated through numerical experiments, both on randomly
generated data and on a real localization problem. Furthermore, in the
noise-free case, it is possible to check the exactness of the solution, and we
test a version of the algorithm that exploits this fact to look for the right

in the training data. The general problem setting is that word embeddings are
induced on an unlabeled training corpus and then a model is trained that embeds
novel words into this induced embedding space. Currently, two approaches for
learning embeddings of novel words exist: (i) learning an embedding from the
novel word's surface-form (e.g., subword n-grams) and (ii) learning an
embedding from the context in which it occurs. In this paper, we propose an
architecture that leverages both sources of information - surface-form and

an unlabeled corpus for training our architecture to produce embeddings

not taken into account in the evaluation procedure. We suggest a method to
construct prior distributions for model defects for reaction models using
neighboring isotopes of $^{56}$Fe as an example. A model defect is usually a
function of energy and describes the difference between the model prediction
and the truth. Of course, neither the truth nor the model defect are
accessible. A Gaussian process (GP) enables to define a probability
distribution on possible shapes of a model defect by referring to intuitively
understandable concepts such as smoothness and the expected magnitude of the
defect. Standard specifications of GPs impose a typical length-scale and
amplitude valid for the whole energy range, which is often not justified, e.g.,
when the model covers both the resonance and statistical range. In this
contribution, we show how a GP with energy-dependent length-scales and
amplitudes can be constructed from available experimental data. The proposed
construction is inspired by a technique called dynamic time warping used, e.g.,
for speech recognition. We demonstrate the feasibility of the data-driven
determination of model defects by inferring a model defect of the nuclear
models code TALYS for (n,p) reactions of isotopes with charge number between 20
and 30. The newly introduced GP parametrization besides its potential to
improve evaluations for reactor relevant isotopes, such as $^{56}$Fe, may also
help to better understand the performance of nuclear models in the future.

  Algorithms Combined with Dimensionality Reduction",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Exploiting capacity of sewer system using decentralized control is a cost
effective mean of minimizing the overflow. Given the size of the real sewer
system, exploiting all the installed control structures in the sewer pipes can
be challenging. This paper presents a divide and conquer solution to implement
decentralized control measures based on unsupervised learning algorithms. A
sewer system is first divided into a number of subcatchments. A series of
natural and built factors that have the impact on sewer system performance is
then collected. Clustering algorithms are then applied to grouping
subcatchments with similar hydraulic hydrologic characteristics. Following
which, principal component analysis is performed to interpret the main features
of sub-catchment groups and identify priority control locations. Overflows
under different control scenarios are compared based on the hydraulic model.
Simulation results indicate that priority control applied to the most suitable
cluster could bring the most profitable result.

algorithm had to assume that the spectral parameters are uniform over the full
sky (or some significant fraction of the sky), it resulted in a bias in the
tensor-to-scalar ratio parameter $r$ estimated from foreground-cleaned
polarization maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The new algorithm,
""Delta-map method"", accounts for spatially varying spectra to first order in

$r$ and the sky-averaged foreground parameters. We show that a cleaned CMB map
is the maximum likelihood solution to first order in perturbation, and derive
the posterior distribution of $r$ and the sky-averaged foreground parameters
using Bayesian statistics. Applying this to realistic simulated sky maps
including polarized CMB, synchrotron and thermal dust emission, we find that
the new algorithm removes the bias in $r$ down to undetected level in our
noiseless simulation ($r\lesssim 4\times 10^{-4}$). We show that the frequency
decorrelation of polarized foregrounds due to averaging of spatially varying
spectra can be accounted for to first order in perturbation by using slightly
different spectral parameters for the Stokes $Q$ and $U$ maps. Finally, we show

Tristan Rivi\`ere in the framework of half-harmonic maps defined either on $R$
or on the sphere $S^1$ with values into a closed manifold $N^n\subset R^m$.
Weak half-harmonic maps are critical points of the following nonlocal energy
$$\int_{R}|(-\Delta)^{1/4}u|^2 dx~~\mbox{or}~~\int_{S^1}|(-\Delta)^{1/4}u|^2\
d\theta.$$
  If $u$ is a sufficiently smooth critical point of the above energy then it
satisfies the following equation of stationarity $$\frac{du}{dx}\cdot
(-\Delta)^{1/2} u=0~~\mbox{a.e in $R$}~~\mbox{or}~~\frac{\partial u}{\partial

derive a countable family of relations involving the Fourier coefficients of

operations below the (kBT ln 2) energy limit. Landauer discussed that it is
impossible to break this limit as long as the computations are performed in the
conventional, non-reversible way. But even if reversible computations were
performed, the basic energy needed for operating circuits realized in
conventional technologies is still far above the (kBT ln 2) energy limit, i.e.
the circuits do not operate physically reversible. In contrast, novel
nanotechnologies like Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) allow for
computations with very low energy dissipation and, hence, are promising
candidates for breaking this limit. Accordingly, the design of reversible QCA
circuits is an active field of research. But whether QCA in general (and the
proposed circuits in particular) are indeed able to operate in a logically and
physically reversible fashion is unknown thus far, because neither physical
realizations nor appropriate simulation approaches were available yet. In this
work, we address this gap by utilizing an established theoretical model that
has been implemented in a physics simulator enabling a precise consideration of
how energy is dissipated in QCA designs. Our results provide strong evidence

Woods-Saxon potential of spheroidal shape and at different deformations. This
model potential is chosen to have a large depth and a small surface diffuseness
which makes it resemble the analytically solved spheroidal cavity in the
semiclassical approximation. For the consistent statistical-equilibrium
collective rotations, the MI is obtained within the cranking model in an
approach which goes beyond the quantum perturbation approximation based on the
non perturbative energy spectrum. For the calculation of the MI shell
corrections $\delta \Theta$, the Strutinsky smoothing procedure is used to
obtain the average occupation numbers of the particle density generated by the
resolution of the Woods-Saxon eigenvalue problem. One finds that the
major-shell structure of $\delta \Theta$, as determined in the adiabatic
approximation, is rooted, for large as well as for small surface deformations,
in the same inhomogenuity of the distribution of single-particle states near
the Fermi surface as the energy shell corrections $\delta E$. This fundamental
property is in agreement with the semiclassical results $\delta \Theta \propto
\delta E$ obtained analytically within the non perturbative periodic orbit
theory for any potential well, in particular for the spheroidal cavity, and for
any deformation, even for large deformations where bifurcations of the
equatorial orbits play a substantial role. Since the adiabatic approximation,
$\omega \ll \Omega$, with $\hbar \Omega $ the distance between major nuclear
shells, is easily obeyed even for large angular momenta typical for high-spin
physics at large particle numbers, our model approach seems to represent a tool
that could be useful for the description of such nuclear systems.

geometries and low tolerances. Ideally, they plan the required motions
autonomously. This poses a substantial challenge due to high-dimensional state
spaces and non-linear contact-dynamics. Furthermore, object poses and model
parameters, such as friction, are not exactly known and a source of
uncertainty. The method proposed in this paper models the task of parts
assembly as a belief space planning problem over an underlying
impedance-controlled, compliant system. To solve this planning problem we
introduce an asymptotically optimal belief space planner by extending an
optimal, randomized, kinodynamic motion planner to non-deterministic domains.
Under an expansiveness assumption we establish probabilistic completeness and
asymptotic optimality. We validate our approach in thorough, simulated and
real-world experiments of multiple assembly tasks. The experiments demonstrate
our planner's ability to reliably assemble objects, solely based on CAD models
as input.

where inference and search are interleaved to find feasible and optimal

connectors with constructive information in CP is notoriously difficult. This
paper presents If Then Else (ITE), a lightweight implementation of stratified
constructive reasoning for logical connectives. Stratification is introduced to
cope with the risk of combinatorial explosion of constructing information from
nested and combined logical operators. ITE is an open-source library built on
top of SICStus Prolog clp(fd), which proposes various operators, including
constructive disjunction and negation, constructive implication and
conditional. These operators can be used to express global constraints and to
benefit from constructive reasoning for more domain pruning during constraint
filtering. Even though ITE is not competitive with specialized filtering
algorithms available in some global constraints implementations, its
expressiveness allows users to easily define well-tuned constraints with
powerful deduction capabilities. Our extended experimental results show that
ITE is more efficient than available generic approaches that handle logical
constraint systems over finite domains.

approach to the problem is an iterative reconstruction algorithm with
regularization term, which can suppress artifacts and improve image quality,
but requires high computational cost.
  The starting point of this paper is the proof of inpainting function for
limited-angle sinogram is continuous, which can be approached by neural
networks in a data-driven method, granted by the universal approximation
theorem. Based on this, we propose SIN as the fitting function -- a
convolutional neural network trained to generate missing sinogram data
conditioned on scanned data. Besides CNN module, we design two differentiable
and rapid modules, Radon and Inverse Radon Transformer network, to encapsulate
the physical model in the training procedure. They enable new joint loss
functions to optimize both sinogram and reconstructed image in sync, which
improved the image quality significantly. To tackle the labeled data bottleneck
in clinical research, we form a sinogram-image-sinogram closed loop, and the
difference between sinograms can be used as training loss. In this way, the
proposed network can be self-trained, with only limited-angle data for
unsupervised domain adaptation.
  We demonstrate the performance of our proposed network on parallel beam X-ray
CT in lung CT datasets from Data Science Bowl 2017 and the ability of
unsupervised transfer learning in Zubal's phantom. The proposed method performs
better than state-of-art method SART-TV in PSNR and SSIM metrics, with
noticeable visual improvements in reconstructions.

First, the hardware, software architecture and state estimation methods are
detailed. All the mechanical designs are fully provided as open-source hardware

Next, a novel detection approach called Rotation-SqueezeDet is proposed to
enable rotation-aware grasping, which can give the target position and rotation

in pillars induces a transmission dip that occurs at a frequency located in the

constructed by removing lines of holes in the holey phononic crystal and
results in a transmission peak that matches the dip. The optimal geometrical
parameters enable us to create a coupling of the cavity mode and the localized

significantly improved the efficiency of the cavity without increasing the

standard mechanism produces high number of packet collisions, which may hinder

uncertainties in the choice of the resource to use for SPS, we can
significantly reduce the message collisions in the C-V2X sidelink Mode 4.
Specifically, we propose the use of the ""lookahead,"" which contains the next
starting resource location in the time-frequency plane. By exchanging the
lookahead information piggybacked on the periodic safety message, vehicular
user equipments (UEs) can eliminate most message collisions arising from the
ignorance of other UEs' internal decisions. Although the proposed scheme would
require the inclusion of the lookahead in the control part of the packet, the
benefit may outweigh the bandwidth cost, considering the stringent reliability

symmetry attract ever-increasing attention and are now a subject for intensive
investigations. One of the commonly used methods providing information about
the optical response of artificial nanostructural media is a so-called
effective medium theory. Here we examine the possibility of utilizing the
effective medium theory for a comprehensive analysis of PT-symmetric
multilayered systems composed of alternating loss and gain slabs. We show that
applicability of local effective material parameters (or Maxwell Garnett
approximation) is very limited and cannot be exploited for a prediction of
exceptional points marking a PT symmetry breaking. On the other hand, nonlocal
bianisotropic effective medium parameters can be reliably used, if the
thickness of a unit cell is much smaller than the radiation wavelength. In the
case of obliquely incident plane waves, we reveal the limitation on the
loss-gain coefficient, which should not be too large compared with the real
part of the permittivity. We believe that our findings can improve the
fundamental understanding of physics behind PT-symmetric systems and advance
the development of auxiliary tools for analyzing their peculiar optical

the finding that immune response markers strongly correlated with infection in
vaccine recipients generated the hypothesis that a qualitative interaction
occurred. This hypothesis can be assessed with statistical methods for studying
treatment effect modification by an intermediate response variable (i.e.,
principal stratification effect modification (PSEM) methods). However,
available PSEM methods make untestable structural risk assumptions, such that
assumption-lean versions of PSEM methods are needed in order to surpass the
high bar of evidence to demonstrate a qualitative interaction. Fortunately, the
survivor average causal effect (SACE) literature is replete with
assumption-lean methods that can be readily adapted to the PSEM application for
the special case of a binary intermediate response variable. We map this
adaptation, opening up a host of new PSEM methods for a binary intermediate

final outcome and including or excluding the SACE monotonicity assumption. The
new methods support that the vaccine partially protected vaccine recipients

independently corrupted Gaussian noisy versions of a remote vector Gaussian
source, and communicate independently with a decoder or CEO over
rate-constrained noise-free links. The CEO also has its own Gaussian noisy
observation of the source and wants to reconstruct the remote source to within
some prescribed distortion level where the incurred distortion is measured
under the logarithmic loss penalty criterion. We find an explicit
characterization of the rate-distortion region of this model. The result can be
seen as the counterpart to the vector Gaussian setting of that by
Courtade-Weissman which provides the rate-distortion region of the model in the
discrete memoryless setting. For the proof of this result, we obtain an outer
bound by means of a technique that relies on the de Bruijn identity and the
properties of Fisher information. The approach is similar to Ekrem-Ulukus outer
bounding technique for the vector Gaussian CEO problem under quadratic
distortion measure, for which it was there found generally non-tight; but it is
shown here to yield a complete characterization of the region for the case of
logarithmic loss measure. Also, we show that Gaussian test channels with
time-sharing exhaust the Berger-Tung inner bound, which is optimal.
Furthermore, application of our results allows us to find the complete
solutions of two related problems: a quadratic vector Gaussian CEO problem with
determinant constraint and the vector Gaussian distributed Information
Bottleneck problem. Finally, we develop Blahut-Arimoto type algorithms that
allow to compute numerically the regions provided in this paper, for both
discrete and Gaussian models. We illustrate the efficiency of our algorithms

severe feedback bottleneck, where achieving the maximal Degrees-of-Freedom
(DoF) performance required feedback from all served users. These costs matched
the caching gains and thus scaled with the number of users. In the context of
the $L$-antenna MISO broadcast channel with $K$ receivers having normalized
cache size $\gamma$, we pair a fundamentally novel algorithm together with a
new information-theoretic converse, and identify the optimal tradeoff between
feedback costs and DoF performance, by showing that having CSIT from only $C<L$
served users implies an optimal one-shot linear DoF of $C+K\gamma$. As a side
consequence of this, we also now understand that the well known DoF performance
$L+K\gamma$ is in fact exactly optimal. In practice, the above means that we
are now able to disentangle caching gains from feedback costs, thus achieving
unbounded caching gains at the mere feedback cost of the multiplexing gain.
This further solidifies the role of caching in boosting multi-antenna systems;
caching now can provide unbounded DoF gains over multi-antenna downlink
systems, at no additional feedback costs. The above results are extended to
also include the corresponding multiple transmitter scenario with caches at
both ends.

a target matrix of authentic samples from grossly corrupted observations. Most
of the existing methods, such as the well-known Robust Principal Component
Analysis (RPCA), assume that the target matrix we wish to recover is low-rank.
However, the underlying data structure is often non-linear in practice,
therefore the low-rankness assumption could be violated. To tackle this issue,
we propose a novel method for matrix recovery in this paper, which could well
handle the case where the target matrix is low-rank in an implicit feature
space but high-rank or even full-rank in its original form. Namely, our method
pursues the low-rank structure of the target matrix in an implicit feature
space. By making use of the specifics of an accelerated proximal gradient based
optimization algorithm, the proposed method could recover the target matrix
with non-linear structures from its corrupted version. Comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of
our method.

methylation is strictly required for the process of imprinting and has to be
faithfully maintained during the entire lifespan. While the regulation of DNA
methylation itself is well understood, the mechanisms whereby the opposite
allele remains unmethylated are unclear. Here, we show that in the mouse, at
maternally methylated ICRs, the paternal allele, which is constitutively
associated with H3K4me2/3, is marked by default by H3K27me3 when these ICRs are
transcriptionally inactive, leading to the formation of a bivalent chromatin
signature. Our data suggest that at ICRs, chromatin bivalency has a protective
role by ensuring that DNA on the paternal allele remains unmethylated and
protected against spurious and unscheduled gene expression. Moreover , they
provide the proof of concept that, beside pluripotent cells, chromatin
bivalency is the default state of transcriptionally inactive CpG island
promoters , regardless of the developmental stage, thereby contributing to
protect cell identity.

to be determined. To address this issue we developed a user-friendly approach
to integrate the stem cell chromatin signature in customized DNA methylation
analyses. We used publicly available ChIP-sequencing datasets of several human
embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines to determine the extent of bivalent chromatin
genome-wide. We then created annotated lists of high-confidence bivalent,
H3K4me3-only and H3K27me3-only chromatin regions. The main features of bivalent
regions included localization in CGI/promoters, depletion in retroelements and
enrichment in specific histone modifications, including the poorly
characterized H3K23me2 mark. Moreover, bivalent promoters could be classified
in three clusters based on PRC2 and PolII complexes occupancy. Genes with
bivalent promoters of the PRC2-defined cluster displayed the lowest expression
upon differentiation. As proof-of-concept, we assessed the DNA methylation
pattern of eight types of tumors and confirmed that aberrant cancer-associated
DNA hypermethylation preferentially targets CGI characterized by bivalent
chromatin in hESCs. We also found that such aberrant DNA hypermethylation
affected particularly bivalent CGI/promoters associated with genes that tend to
remain repressed upon differentiation. Strikingly, bivalent CGI were the most
affected by aberrant DNA hypermethylation in both CpG Island Methylator

transcriptional silencing in the pre-tumorigenic cells, the bivalent chromatin

Trap Trace Analysis, an application of techniques from quantum physics such as
laser cooling and trapping, allows to reduce the sample volume by several
orders of magnitude, compared to conventional techniques. Here we show that the

at Chli Titlis glacier in 3030 m all (Swiss Alps) have been dated by

fields; since AlexNet, networks used in practice are going wider and deeper. On
the theoretical side, a long line of works has been focusing on training neural
networks with one hidden layer. The theory of multi-layer networks remains
largely unsettled.
  In this work, we prove why stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can find
$\textit{global minima}$ on the training objective of DNNs in
$\textit{polynomial time}$. We only make two assumptions: the inputs are
non-degenerate and the network is over-parameterized. The latter means the
network width is sufficiently large: $\textit{polynomial}$ in $L$, the number
of layers and in $n$, the number of samples.
  Our key technique is to derive that, in a sufficiently large neighborhood of
the random initialization, the optimization landscape is almost-convex and
semi-smooth even with ReLU activations. This implies an equivalence between
over-parameterized neural networks and neural tangent kernel (NTK) in the
finite (and polynomial) width setting.
  As concrete examples, starting from randomly initialized weights, we prove
that SGD can attain 100% training accuracy in classification tasks, or minimize
regression loss in linear convergence speed, with running time polynomial in
$n,L$. Our theory applies to the widely-used but non-smooth ReLU activation,
and to any smooth and possibly non-convex loss functions. In terms of network
architectures, our theory at least applies to fully-connected neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (CNN), and residual neural networks (ResNet).

that the disks are either optically thick at 1.1 mm, or that significant grain
growth has already occurred. We identify, for the first time, a single compact
continuum source ($R \sim 100$ au) toward N6 embedded within a larger continuum

concentrated, with a density profile that follows a $r^{-1.3}$ power law within

important concept for analyzing ultra-reliable low-latency communications

measure. However, an average AoI based design falls short in properly
characterizing the performance of URLLC systems as it cannot account for
extreme events that occur with very low probabilities. In contrast, in this
paper, the main objective is to go beyond the traditional notion of average AoI
by characterizing and optimizing a URLLC system while capturing the AoI tail
distribution. In particular, the problem of vehicles' power minimization while
ensuring stringent latency and reliability constraints in terms of
probabilistic AoI is studied. To this end, a novel and efficient mapping
between both AoI and queue length distributions is proposed. Subsequently,
extreme value theory (EVT) and Lyapunov optimization techniques are adopted to
formulate and solve the problem. Simulation results shows a nearly two-fold
improvement in terms of shortening the tail of the AoI distribution compared to
a baseline whose design is based on the maximum queue length among vehicles,
when the number of vehicular user equipment (VUE) pairs is 80. The results also
show that this performance gain increases significantly as the number of VUE
pairs increases.

of bipedal walking that is composed of three pendulums to simulate falling,
swing and torso dynamics. Taking advantage of linear equations and closed-form
solutions of the 3LP model, our proposed controller projects intermediate
states of the biped back to the beginning of the phase for which a discrete LQR
controller is designed. After the projection, a proper control policy is
generated by this LQR controller and used at the intermediate time. This
control paradigm reacts to disturbances immediately and includes rules to
account for swing dynamics and leg-retraction. We apply it to a simulated Atlas
robot in position-control, always commanded to perform in-place walking. The
stance hip joint in our robot keeps the torso upright to let the robot
naturally fall, and the swing hip joint tracks the desired footstep location.
Combined with simple Center of Pressure (CoP) damping rules in the low-level
controller, our foot-placement enables the robot to recover from strong pushes
and produce periodic walking gaits when subject to persistent sources of
disturbance, externally or internally. These gaits are imprecise, i.e.,
emergent from asymmetry sources rather than precisely imposing a desired
velocity to the robot. Also in extreme conditions, restricting linearity
assumptions of the 3LP model are often violated, but the system remains robust
in our simulations. An extensive analysis of closed-loop eigenvalues, viable
regions and sensitivity to push timings further demonstrate the strengths of
our simple controller.

we focus on the surrogate modeling of a particular type of computational models

yield a unique output for each set of input parameters, stochastic simulators
inherently contain some sources of randomness and the output at a given point
is a probability density function. Characterizing the stochastic simulators is
even more time consuming. This paper represents stochastic simulators as a
stochastic process and describes a metamodeling approach based on the

waveforms through an auto-regressive framework. However, they often suffer from
noisy outputs because of the difficulties in capturing the complicated
time-varying nature of speech signals. To improve modeling efficiency, the
proposed ExcitNet vocoder employs an adaptive inverse filter to decouple
spectral components from the speech signal. The residual component, i.e.

In this way, the quality of the synthesized speech signal can be further
improved since the spectral component is well represented by a deep learning
framework and, moreover, the residual component is efficiently generated by the
WaveNet framework. Experimental results show that the proposed ExcitNet
vocoder, trained both speaker-dependently and speaker-independently,
outperforms traditional linear prediction vocoders and similarly configured

an omni-directional antenna or an antenna array is used at the receiver (i.e.

alignment problem is formulated as a sparse encoding and phaseless decoding
problem. More specifically, the problem of interest involves finding a sparse
sensing matrix and an efficient recovery algorithm to recover the support and
magnitude of the sparse signal from compressive phaseless measurements. A
sparse bipartite graph coding (SBG-Coding) algorithm is developed for sparse

from $\mathcal{O}(K^2)$ measurements, where $K$ is the number of nonzero

paper, we propose dense RNNs for scene labeling by exploring various long-range
semantic dependencies among image units. Different from existing RNN based
approaches, our dense RNNs are able to capture richer contextual dependencies
for each image unit by enabling immediate connections between each pair of
image units, which significantly enhances their discriminative power. Besides,
to select relevant dependencies and meanwhile to restrain irrelevant ones for
each unit from dense connections, we introduce an attention model into dense
RNNs. The attention model allows automatically assigning more importance to
helpful dependencies while less weight to unconcerned dependencies. Integrating
with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we develop an end-to-end scene

demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the baselines by large

clearing of mechanisms of this reaction. Furthermore, we have considered the
3He(2H,{\gamma})5Li reaction in the low energy range in the modified potential
cluster model with splitting of orbital states according to Young tableaux and,
in some cases, with forbidden states. These reaction also form part of the
nucleosynthesis chain of the processes occurring in the early stages of
formation of stable stars, and are possible candidates for overcoming the
well-known problem of the A = 5 gap in the synthesis of light elements in the
primordial Universe. Continuing study we have considered the radiative capture
4He(3He, {\gamma})7Be at superlow energies, which has a undeniable interest for
nuclear astrophysics, since it takes part in the proton-proton fusion chain,
and new experimental data on the astrophysical S-factors of this process at
energies down to 90 keV and 23 keV and data on the radiative capture reaction
4He(3H,{\gamma})7Li down to 50 keV appeared recently. Moreover, radiative
capture reactions 4He(3He,{\gamma})7Be and 4He(2H,{\gamma})6Li may have played
a certain role in prestellar nucleosynthesis after the Big Bang, when the
temperature of the Universe decreased to the value of 0.3 T9.

Theoretical justifications for the effectiveness of the SML algorithms are

  This paper provides a review of SML from a Bayesian decision theoretic point

important SML techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning, deep

illustrate the SML techniques with three moderately large data sets where we
also discuss many practical implementation issues. Thus the review is
especially targeted at statisticians and computer scientists who are aspiring
to understand and apply SML for moderately large to big data sets.

A good representation should capture phonetic content and abstract away from
other types of variability, such as speaker differences and channel noise.
Previous work in this area has primarily focused unsupervised learning from
target language data only, and has been evaluated only intrinsically. Here we
directly compare multiple methods, including some that use only target language
speech data and some that use transcribed speech from other (non-target)

downstream unsupervised word segmentation and clustering task. We find that
combining two existing target-language-only methods yields better features than
either method alone. Nevertheless, even better results are obtained by
extracting target language bottleneck features using a model trained on other

provide this benefit, but multilingual training helps even more. In addition to
these results, which hold across both intrinsic measures and the extrinsic

attainable accuracy as a function of lag and time spent observing, and
identifies simple modifications to improve the observability of a given graph.
We show that one form of the graph modification problem is in NP-Complete. The

We report the results from the determination of stellar masses,
carbon and oxygen abundances in the atmospheres of 107 stars from the CHEPS
program. Our stars are drawn from a population with a significantly super-solar
metallicity. At least 10 of these stars are known to host orbiting planets.
  Aims. In this work, we set out to understand the behavior of carbon and
oxygen abundance in stars with different spectral classes, metallicities and V
sin i , within the metal-rich stellar population.
  Methods. Masses of these stars were determined using the data from Gaia DR2
release. The oxygen and carbon abundances were determined by fitting the
absorption lines. Oxygen abundances were determined by fits to the 6300.304 A O
I line and for the determination of the carbon abundances we used 3 lines of
the C I atom and 12 lines of C2 molecule.
  Results. We determine masses and abundances of 107 CHEPS stars. There is no
evidence that the [C/O] ratio depends on V sin i or the mass of the star,
within our constrained range of masses, i.e. 0.82 < Mstar/Msun < 1.5 and
metallicities -0.27 < [Fe=H] < +0.39 and we confirm that metal-rich dwarf stars
with planets are more carbon-rich in comparison with non-planet host stars,
with a statistical signifcance of 96%.
  Conclusions. We find tentative evidence that there is a slight offset to
lower abundance and a greater dispersion in oxygen abundances relative to
carbon, and interpret this as potentially arising from the production of the
oxygen being more effective at more metal-poor epochs. We also find evidence
that for lower mass star's the angular momentum loss in star's with planets as
measured by V sin i is steeper than star's without planets. In general, we find
that the fast rotators (V sin i > 5 km/s) are massive stars.

model, the effectiveness of ICWT is investigated in a sewer system in Drammen,
Norway. Concerning the whole system performance, we found that the S{\o}ren
Lemmich pump station plays a vital role in the ICWT framework. To enhance the
operation of this pump station, it is imperative to construct a multi-step
ahead water level prediction model. Hence, one of the most promising artificial
intelligence techniques, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), is employed to
undertake this task. Experiments demonstrated that LSTM is superior to Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Feed-forward Neural

cities. Understanding the behavior of sewer system through proper urban
hydrological models is an effective method of enhancing sewer system
management. Conventional deterministic methods, which heavily rely on physical
principles, is inappropriate for real-time purpose due to their expensive
computation. On the other hand, data-driven methods have gained huge interests,
but most studies only focus on modeling a single component of the sewer system
and supply information at a very abstract level. In this paper, we proposed the
DeepCSO model, which aims at forecasting CSO events from multiple CSO
structures simultaneously in near real time at a citywide level. The proposed
model provided an intermediate methodology that combines the flexibility of
data-driven methods and the rich information contained in deterministic methods
while avoiding the drawbacks of these two methods. A comparison of the results
demonstrated that the deep learning based multi-task model is superior to the
traditional methods.

pulsations of a cluster of encapsulated microbubbles under the action of an
ultrasound field are complex and highly nonlinear, particularly for drug and

paper, based on Qin-Ferrara's model [S.P. Qin, K.W. Ferrara, J. Acoust. Soc.
Am. 128 (2010) 1511], the complete synchronization and cluster formation in
targeted microbubbles network are studied. Also, association schemes as a novel
approach are suggested for finding a relationship between coupled microbubbles
elements which are immersed in blood or surrounding soft tissue. { A
significant advantage of this method is that the stability of the synchronized
state (or symmetric eigenmode of mutual bubble oscillation) with respect to
another state (another eigenmode) can now predict.} More interestingly, we find
a significant relationship between an isolated and multiple microbubbles. The
results show that the problem of studying the dynamics of encapsulated
microbubble cluster at synchronization state is dependent on the dynamical
characteristics of isolated cases, shell thickness, density. Also, the distance
between microbubbles has an important role in their synchronous modes.

networks) are too slow for real-time application despite the excellent tracking
precision compared with the traditional ones. Moreover, neural networks are
memory intensive which will take up lots of hardware resources. In this paper,
a feature selection visual tracking algorithm combining CNN based
MDNet(Multi-Domain Network) and RoIAlign was developed. We find that there is a
lot of redundancy in feature maps from convolutional layers. So valid feature
maps are selected by mutual information and others are abandoned which can
reduce the complexity and computation of the network and do not affect the
precision. The major problem of MDNet also lies in the time efficiency.
Considering the computational complexity of MDNet is mainly caused by the large
amount of convolution operations and fine-tuning of the network during
tracking, a RoIAlign layer which could conduct the convolution over the whole
image instead of each RoI is added to accelerate the convolution and a new
strategy of fine-tuning the fully-connected layers is used to accelerate the
update. With RoIAlign employed, the computation speed has been increased and it
shows greater precision than RoIPool. Because RoIAlign can process float number
coordinates by bilinear interpolation. These strategies can accelerate the
processing, reduce the complexity with very low impact on precision and it can
run at around 10 fps(while the speed of MDNet is about 1 fps). The proposed
algorithm has been evaluated on a benchmark: OTB100, on which high precision
and speed have been obtained.

dynamical setting, also distinguishing between entropic contributions of the
signal and the error. Furthermore, it provides a suitable approximation of
standard GME problems when the exacted solutions are hard to evaluate. We test
this method by performing numerical simulations at various sample sizes and
batch dimensions. Moreover, we extend this analysis exploring intermediate
cases between streaming GCE and standard GCE, i.e. considering blocks of
observations of different sizes to update the estimates, and incorporating
collinearity effects as well. The role of time in the balance between entropic
contributions of signal and errors is further explored considering a variation

which has shown remarkable successes in processing sequential data. The typical
architecture of an LSTM involves a set of states and gates: the states retain
information over arbitrary time intervals and the gates regulate the flow of
information. Due to the recursive nature of LSTMs, they are computationally
intensive to deploy on edge devices with limited hardware resources. To reduce
the computational complexity of LSTMs, we first introduce a method that learns
to retain only the important information in the states by pruning redundant
information. We then show that our method can prune over 90% of information in
the states without incurring any accuracy degradation over a set of temporal
tasks. This observation suggests that a large fraction of the recurrent
computations are ineffectual and can be avoided to speed up the process during
the inference as they involve noncontributory multiplications/accumulations
with zero-valued states. Finally, we introduce a custom hardware accelerator
that can perform the recurrent computations using both sparse and dense states.
Experimental measurements show that performing the computations using the
sparse states speeds up the process and improves energy efficiency by up to
5.2x when compared to implementation results of the accelerator performing the
computations using dense states.

control and functional abilities in children with cerebral palsy (CP). The
purpose of this study was to determine the extent of functional change in
children with CP who participated in specific trunk and head postural control
training combined with physical therapy treatment as usual (TAU).
  Methods This study included 140 consecutive referrals to a centre
specialising in head and trunk postural control (Targeted Training (TT))
between 2009 and 2016. Twenty-five children discontinued therapy due to
surgery, health, family issues or poor attendance. The remaining 115 children
(46 girls, 69 boys) had a mean age of 6 y 6 mo (SD 2 y 8 mo) with participants
from all GMFCS levels. The intervention was a program of TT and ongoing TAU
with a mean duration of 11 months. Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM),
Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory functional skills, Chailey Levels
of Ability and Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control were administered before
and after the intervention.
  Results There were significant improvements in all outcomes. GMFM
improvements exceeded those predicted from the published reference curves,
especially for the children with more severe cerebral palsy.
  Conclusions Functional improvement exceeded the expected norm, especially in
those children with more severe gross motor function disability. The other
outcomes also showed significant improvements. These findings support the case
for further studies and, if needed, tool development to facilitate
determination of the critical elements in a combined therapy approach of TT
with TAU.

according to the needs of its users. This, in fact, can be regarded as one of
the highest forthcoming priorities of future networks. In this paper, we
propose a system for Out-Patient (OP) centric Long Term Evolution-Advanced

along with current readings from their body sensors are processed and analyzed
to predict the likelihood of a life-threatening medical condition, for
instance, an imminent stroke. This prediction is used to ensure that the OP is
assigned an optimal LTE-A Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) to transmit their
critical data to their healthcare provider with minimal delay. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time big data analytics are utilized to
optimize a cellular network in an OP-conscious manner. The PRBs assignment is
optimized using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and a real-time
heuristic. Two approaches are proposed, the Weighted Sum Rate Maximization
(WSRMax) approach and the Proportional Fairness (PF) approach. The approaches
increased the OPs' average SINR by 26.6% and 40.5%, respectively. The WSRMax
approach increased the system's total SINR to a level higher than that of the
PF approach, however, the PF approach reported higher SINRs for the OPs, better
fairness and a lower margin of error.

mathematical morphology is implemented to automatically label the

then validated by comparing to agglomerative hierarchical clustering.
Experimental results demonstrate that the developed kMC-KNN method, in
comparison to the traditional KNN, can shorten the recognition time by over
72.67% with recognition accuracy of 90%-98%. In addition, our developed kMC-KNN
