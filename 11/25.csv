  arXiv:1811.07216",,,,"q-bio.QM physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Melanoma is a type of skin cancer developed from melanocytes. It is one of
the most lethal types of cancer, accounting for approximately 75% of skin
cancer deaths. Late stage melanoma is very difficult to treat, since the cancer
cells are deranged, may be genetically linked and can be unresponsive to
therapy. Therefore, determining how to effectively make use of different
treatment regimens is of vital importance to survival. In this analysis, we
propose an adaptive treatment recommendation system based on a hybrid
cluster-classification (CC) structure. Our proposed system consists of two
parts,1) distribution based clustering and 2) classification. Our
recommendation system can help to identify high-risk melanoma patients and
suggest the best approach to treatment, which enables clinicians and patients
to make decisions on the basis of real-world data. Our data came from the
Canadian Melanoma Research Network (CMRN) database, a pan-Canadian multi-year
observational database, which is part of Global Melanoma Registry Network
(GMRN). Training/testing sets are generated based on data from different
sources, leading to cross cohort analysis tasks. Experimental results show that
our proposed system achieves very promising results with an overall accuracy of
up to 80%.

Unlike existing RGBT trackers, our FANet aggregates hierarchical deep features
within each modality to handle the challenge of significant appearance changes
caused by deformation, low illumination, background clutter and occlusion. In
particular, we employ the operations of max pooling to transform these
hierarchical and multi-resolution features into uniform space with the same
resolution, and use 1x1 convolution operation to compress feature dimensions to
achieve more effective hierarchical feature aggregation. To model the
interactions between RGB and thermal modalities, we elaborately design an
adaptive aggregation subnetwork to integrate features from different modalities
based on their reliabilities and thus are able to alleviate noise effects
introduced by low-quality sources. The whole FANet is trained in an end-to-end
manner. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate the
high-accurate performance against other state-of-the-art RGBT tracking methods.

properties of materials. Although many previous studies investigated the
mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement at high hydrogen concentration, few studies
concentrate on the mechanism at low hydrogen concentration which is before the
formation of hydrides (only in the hydrogen complex state). The purpose of this
study is to illuminate the formation mechanism of hydrogen complex. We
calculate the formation energy Evac binding energy EH, EH-vac using ABINIT
software package. For hydrogen atom at different states in lattice, we obtained
Evac increased from 26.3% to 84.6% and EH-vac increased from 40.6% to 119.3%.
This indicates that the bond between the original Zr atoms is weakened by
hydrogen atoms entering the lattice and formation of vacancy is more possible.
In addition, vacancies make hydrogen atoms and Zr atoms more closely connected
and further increases the vacancies formation. Therefore, hydrogen complexes
tend to expand in lattice, the brittleness of hydrogen complex becomes the main
cause of hydrogen embrittlement.

depends on convexity properties of Grassmannians which come into play as the
targets of the (harmonic) Gauss maps of our minimal submanifolds. In fact, we
develop a general method to construct subsets of complete Riemannian manifolds

manifolds. When applied to Grassmannians, for codimension 2, it yields an
appropriate domain that cannot contain nontrivial images of such harmonic maps.

trend observed in the world of deep learning is the rise of distributed

in several new innovations in training on low powered devices including a fault

Euclidean plane.
  Deciding whether there exists an embedding of a given unit disk graph, i.e.
unit disk graph recognition, is an important geometric problem, and has many
application areas.
  In general, this problem is known to be $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete.
  In some applications, the objects that correspond to unit disks, have
predefined (geometrical) structures to be placed on.
  Hence, many researchers attacked this problem by restricting the domain of
the disk centers.
  One example to such applications is wireless sensor networks, where each disk
corresponds to a wireless sensor node, and a pair of intersecting disks
corresponds to a pair of sensors being able to communicate with one another.
  It is usually assumed that the nodes have identical sensing ranges, and thus
a unit disk graph model is used to model problems concerning wireless sensor
networks.
  We consider the unit disk graph realization problem on a restricted domain,
by assuming a scenario where the wireless sensor nodes are deployed on the
corridors of a building.
  Based on this scenario, we impose a geometric constraint such that the unit
disks must be centered onto given straight lines.
  In this paper, we first describe a polynomial-time reduction which shows that
deciding whether a graph can be realized as unit disks onto given straight
lines is NP-hard, when the given lines are parallel to either $x$-axis or
$y$-axis.
  Using the reduction we described, we also show that this problem is
NP-complete when the given lines are only parallel to $x$-axis (and one
another).
  We obtain those results using the idea of the logic engine introduced by
Bhatt and Cosmadakis in 1987.

criterion for binning parcels inside and outside the vortex according to their
values of the Lagrangian descriptor and associated PDF. This definition is
justified by using arguments that go beyond heuristic considerations based on
the potential vorticity. Next, we turn to the filamentation proceses along this

Disparate image pairs are deemed those that exhibit strong affine variations in
scale, viewpoint and projection parameters accompanied by the presence of
partial or complete occlusion of objects and extreme variations in ambient
illumination. Under these challenging conditions, neither local nor global
feature-based image matching methods, when used in isolation, have been
observed to be effective. The proposed correspondence determination scheme for
matching disparate images exploits high-level shape cues that are derived from
low-level local feature descriptors, thus combining the best of both worlds. A
graph-based representation for the disparate image pair is generated by
constructing an affinity matrix that embeds the distances between feature
points in two images, thus modeling the correspondence determination problem as
one of graph matching. The eigenspectrum of the affinity matrix, i.e., the
learned global shape representation, is then used to further regress the
transformation or homography that defines the correspondence between the source
image and target image. The proposed scheme is shown to yield state-of-the-art
results for both, coarse-level shape matching as well as fine point-wise
correspondence determination.

exploited to confine plasma in magnetic confinement fusion devices. Typically,
the gyroradius is small compared to the system size and thus the gyromotion can
be averaged out. The resulting charged particle motion closely follows a
magnetic field line. At the edge of fusion devices, the magnetic field usually
impinges on a wall at a shallow angle. A boundary layer forms in which the
plasma density changes over a characteristic distance from the wall of the
order of the ion gyroradius, as ions are absorbed during their gyromotion. This
boundary layer is called magnetic presheath, and is typically collisionless and
quasineutral. Importantly, the electric field in this region distorts the ion
gyro-orbits, making them non-circular and thus affecting the ion density
profile. Solving the magnetic presheath amounts to obtaining the
self-consistent electric field for which the net charge density is zero.
  In this thesis, I assume a small magnetic field angle and small gradients
parallel to the wall to develop an asymptotic theory for the magnetic
presheath, which is used to obtain the ion density. The small, yet crucial,
contribution of the part of the orbit near the wall is included. To demonstrate
the theory for a case without any gradients parallel to the wall, I calculate
numerically the self-consistent electrostatic potential by assuming the

dependence of magnetic presheath characteristics on magnetic field angle and
ion temperature. The distribution function of ions that have traversed the

or the large-scale distribution of matter, have long been used as clean probes
of dark matter (DM) interactions with baryons. It is standard to model the DM
as an ideal fluid with a thermal Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) velocity distribution,
in order to compute the heat and momentum-exchange rates relevant to these
probes. This approximation only applies in the limit where DM self-interactions
are frequent enough to efficiently redistribute DM velocities. It does not
accurately describe weakly self-interacting particles, whose velocity
distribution unavoidably departs from MB once they decouple from baryons. This
article lays out a new formalism required to accurately model DM-baryon
scattering, even when DM self-interactions are negligible. The ideal fluid
equations are replaced by the collisional Boltzmann equation for the DM
phase-space distribution. The collision operator is approximated by a
Fokker-Planck operator, constructed to recover the exact heat and momentum
exchange rates, and allowing for an efficient numerical implementation.
Numerical solutions to the background evolution are presented, which show that
the MB approximation can over-estimate the heat-exchange rate by factors of ~
2-3, especially for light DM particles. A Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck hierarchy for
perturbations is derived. This new formalism allows to explore a wider range of
DM models, and will be especially relevant for upcoming ultra-high-sensitivity

is less constrained, currently the upper bounds on the respective integrality
gaps for the two problems are the same.
  An approach to proving integrality gaps for both of these problems is to
consider fundamental classes of extreme points. For 2EC, better bounds on the
integrality gap are known for certain important special cases of these
fundamental points. For example, for half-integer square points, the
integrality gap is between $\frac{6}{5}$ and $\frac{4}{3}$. Our main result is
to improve the approximation factor to $\frac{9}{7}$ for 2EC for these points.
Our approach is based on constructing convex combinations and our key tool is
the top-down coloring framework for tree augmentation, whose flexibility we
employ to exploit beneficial properties in both the initial spanning tree and
in the input graph. We also show how these tools can be tailored to the closely
related problem of uniform covers for which the proofs of the best-known bounds

coastal and to some extent, inland areas. A detailed understanding of
evacuation behavior is fundamental to the development of efficient emergency
plans. Once a household decides to evacuate, a key behavioral issue is the time
at which individuals depart to reach their destination. An accurate estimation
of evacuation departure time is useful to predict evacuation demand over time
and develop effective evacuation strategies. In addition, the time it takes for
evacuees to reach their preferred destinations is important. A holistic
understanding of the factors that affect travel time is useful to emergency
officials in controlling road traffic and helps in preventing adverse
conditions like traffic jams. Past studies suggest that departure time and
travel time can be related. Hence, an important question arises whether there
is an interdependence between evacuation departure time and travel time? Does
departing close to the landfall increases the possibility of traveling short
distances? Are people more likely to depart early when destined to longer
distances? In this study, we present a model to jointly estimate departure and
travel times during hurricane evacuations. Empirical results underscore the
importance of accommodating an inter-relationship among these dimensions of
evacuation behavior. This paper also attempts to empirically investigate the
influence of social ties of individuals on joint estimation of evacuation
departure and travel times. Survey data from Hurricane Sandy is used for
computing empirical results. Results indicate significant role of social
networks in addition to other key factors on evacuation departure and travel

the fission of even-even isotopes of superheavy elements from Hs (Z=108) to Og
(Z=118) are estimated using a pre-scission point model. We restrict to nuclei
for which spontaneous fission has been experimentally observed. The potential
energy surfaces are calculated with Strutinsky's shell correction procedure.
The parametrization of the nuclear shapes is based on Cassini ovals. For the
just before scission configuration we fix $\alpha$=0.98, what corresponds to
$r_{neck}\approx 2$ fm, and take into account another four deformation
parameters: $\alpha_1,\alpha_3,\alpha_4,\alpha_6$. The fragment-mass
distributions are estimated supposing they are due to thermal fluctuations in
the mass asymmetry degree of freedom just before scission. The influence of the
excitation energy of the fissioning system on these distributions is studied.
The distributions of the total kinetic energy (TKE) of the fragments are also
calculated (in the point-charge approximation). In Hs, Ds and Cn isotopes a
transition from symmetric to asymmetric fission is predicted with increasing
neutron number N (at N$\approx$168). Super-symmetric fission ocurs at
N$\approx$160. When the excitation energy increases from 0 to 30 MeV, the peaks
(one or two) of the mass distributions become only slightly wider. The first
two moments of the TKE distributions are displayed as a function of the mass
number A of the fissioning nucleus. A slow decrease of the average energy and a
minimum of the width (at N$\approx$162) is found.

multi-vehicle systems in applications like transportation, search and rescue,
and robotic exploration. Chance-constrained methods like Iterative Risk
Allocation (IRA)\cite{IRA} have been developed for situations where
environmental disturbances are unbounded. However, chance-constrained methods
for the multi-vehicle case generally use centralized strategies where the
vehicle set is planned with couplings between all vehicle pairs. This approach
is intractable as fleet size increases because computation time is exponential
with respect to the number of vehicles being planned over due to a polynomial
increase in coupling constraints between vehicle pairs. We present a faster
approach for chance-constrained multi-vehicle path-planning that relies upon a
decentralized path-planning method called Risk-Aware Decentralized Model
Predictive Control (RADMPC) to rapidly approximate a centralized IRA approach.
The RADMPC approximation is evaluated for vehicle interactions to determine the
vehicle sets that should be planned in a coupled manner. Applying IRA to the
smaller vehicle sets determined from the RADMPC approximation rapidly plans
safe paths for the entire fleet. A Monte Carlo simulation analysis demonstrates
the correctness of our approach and a significant improvement in computation
time compared to a centralized IRA approach.

and thermal transport of borophane layer, a two-dimensional anisotropic Dirac
semi-metal with two tilted and anisotropic Dirac cones. In a systematic
framework, we have calculated exactly the electrical conductivity and
thermoelectric coefficients of borophane in the presence of the short-range,
long-range charged impurity and the short-range electro-magnetic (SREM)
scatterers, by using the exact solution of the Boltzmann transport equation
within the linear-response theory. Contrary to the large electron-hole
asymmetry in borophane, its electron-hole conductivity is nearly symmetric.
Interestingly, for the short-range scatters, just like graphene, the
short-range conductivities of borophane have the constant values, independent
of the chemical potential, while the conductivities of the SREM scatterers are
linearly dependent on the chemical potential. Regardless of the impurity type,
the electric conductivity of borophane is highly anisotropic, while the Seebeck
coefficient and figure of merit (${\it ZT}$) are isotropic. Along with the
ambipolar nature of the borophane thermopower, a very high value of ${\it ZT}$
around unity is obtained at room temperature, due to the large asymmetry
between electrons and holes in borophane. More importantly, borophane attains
its maximum value of ${\it ZT}$ at very low chemical potentials, in the
vicinity of the charge neutrality point. In comparison to phosphorene, a highly
unique anisotropic 2D material, borophane with a higher anisotropy ratio
($\sigma_{xx}/\sigma_{yy}\sim10$), is an unprecedented anisotropic material.
This high anisotropy ratio together with the large figure of merit, suggest
that borophane is promising for the thermoelectric applications and transport
switching in the Dirac transport channels.

challenging task. The main factor affecting its performance is the lack of a
sufficiently large training dataset with accurate hand-keypoint annotations. In
this work, we circumvent this problem by proposing an effective method for
generating realistic hand poses and show that state-of-the-art algorithms for
hand pose estimation can be greatly improved by utilizing the generated hand
poses as training data. Specifically, we first adopt an augmented reality (AR)
simulator to synthesize hand poses with accurate hand-keypoint labels. Although
the synthetic hand poses come with precise joint labels, eliminating the need
of manual annotations, they look unnatural and are not the ideal training data.
To produce more realistic hand poses, we propose to blend a synthetic hand pose
with a real background, such as arms and sleeves. To this end, we develop
tonality-alignment generative adversarial networks (TAGANs), which align the
tonality and color distributions between synthetic hand poses and real
backgrounds, and can generate high quality hand poses. We evaluate TAGAN on
three benchmarks, including the RHP, STB, and CMU-PS hand pose datasets. With
the aid of the synthesized poses, our method performs favorably against the
state-of-the-arts in both 2D and 3D hand pose estimations.

  Firstly, the environment is modelled as the generic communication channel
between agents. Secondly, the UIC model adopts a learning-agent model for
unifying several well-adopted agent architecture, e.g. rule-based agent model
in complex adaptive systems, layered model for describing human-level
intelligence, world-model based agent model. The model may also provide an
unified approach to investigate a multi-agent system (MAS) having multiple
action-perception modalities, e.g. explicitly information transfer and implicit
information transfer.
  This treatise would be divided into three parts, and this first part provides
an overview of the UIC model without introducing cumbersome mathematical
analysis and optimizations. In the second part of this treatise, case studies
with quantitative analysis driven by the UIC model would be provided,
exemplifying the adoption of the UIC model in multi-agent system. Specifically,
two representative cases would be studied, namely the analysis of a natural
multi-agent system, as well as the co-design of communication, perception and
action in an artificial multi-agent system. In the third part of this treatise,
the paper provides further insights and future research directions motivated by
the UIC model, such as unification of single intelligence and collective
intelligence, a possible explanation of intelligence emergence and a dual model
for agent-environment intelligence hypothesis.

move backwards. In other words, biological age could actually decline. Our
paper is inspired by the growing body of medical literature that has identified
biomarkers which indicate how people age at different rates. This offers better
estimates of expected remaining lifetime and future mortality rates. It isn't
farfetched to argue that in the not-too-distant future personal age will be
more closely associated with biological vs. calendar age. Thus, after
introducing our stochastic mortality model we derive optimal consumption rates
in a classic Yaari (1965) framework adjusted to our proper clock time. In
addition to the normative implications of having access to biological age, our
positive objective is to partially explain the cross-sectional heterogeneity in
retirement spending rates at any given chronological age. In sum, we argue that
neither biological nor chronological age alone is a sufficient statistic for
making economic decisions. Rather, both ages are required to behave rationally.

$\partial\Omega$ vanishes. Such a solution is called a Meissner solution.
Various properties of the Meissner solutions are examined, including
regularity, classification and asymptotic behavior for large value of the
Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa$. It is shown that the Meissner solution is
smooth in $\Omega$, however the regularity of the magnetic potential outside
$\Omega$ can be rather poor. This observation leads to the ides of
decomposition of the Meissner system into two problems, a boundary value
problem in $\Omega$ and an exterior problem outside of $\Omega$. We show that
the solutions of the boundary value problem with fixed boundary data converges
uniformly on $\Omega$ as $\kappa$ tends to $\infty$, where the limit field of
the magnetic potential is a solution of a nonlinear curl system. This indicates
that, the magnetic potential part $\mathbf A$ of the solution $(f,\mathbf A)$
of the Meissner system, which has same tangential component of $curl \mathbf A$
on $\partial\Omega$, converges to a solution of the curl system as $\kappa$
increases to infinity, which verifies that the curl system is indeed the
correct limit of the Meissner system in the case of three dimensions.

weeks per year for males and 1-3 weeks for females. In the year 2004 market
prices implied a $40.1\%$ probability of survival to the age 90 for a 75-year
old male ($51.2\%$ for a female) annuitant. By the year 2013 the implied
survival probability had increased to $46.1\%$ (and $53.1\%$). The
corresponding implied life expectancy has increased (at the age of 75) from
13.09 years for males (15.08 years for females) to 14.28 years (and 15.61
years.) Although these values are implied directly from markets, they are
consistent with demographic projections. Similar to implied volatility in
option pricing, we believe that our implied survival probabilities (ISP) and
implied life expectancy (ILE) are relevant for the financial management of
assets post-retirement and very important for the optimal timing and allocation
to annuities; procrastinators are swimming against an uncertain but rather
strong longevity trend.

structure we derive a general description for breathing dynamics of
(anti-)skyrmions in the limit of radius much larger than the domain wall width.
The effective energy landscape reveals two qualitatively different types of
breathing behavior. For small energy perturbations we reproduce the well-known
small breathing mode excitations, where the magnetic moments of the skyrmion
oscillate around their equilibrium solution. At higher energies we find a
breathing behavior where the in-plane angle of the skyrmion continuously
precesses, transforming N\'eel to Bloch skyrmions and vice versa. For a damped
system we observe the transition from the continuously rotating and breathing
skyrmion into the oscillatory one. We analyze the characteristic frequencies of
both breathing types, as well as their amplitudes and distinct energy

problem where an online learner receives partial feedback information from the
environment in the course of learning. Under this setting, Flaxman et al.[8]
extended Zinkevich's classical Online Gradient Descent (OGD) algorithm [29] by
proposing the Online Gradient Descent with Expected Gradient (OGDEG) algorithm.
Specifically, it uses a simple trick to approximate the gradient of the loss
function $f_t$ by evaluating it at a single point and bounds the expected
regret as $\mathcal{O}(T^{5/6})$ [8], where the number of rounds is $T$.
Meanwhile, past research efforts have shown that compared with the first-order
algorithms, second-order online learning algorithms such as Online Newton Step
(ONS) [11] can significantly accelerate the convergence rate of traditional
online learning algorithms. Motivated by this, this paper aims to exploit the
second-order information to speed up the convergence of the OGDEG algorithm. In
particular, we extend the ONS algorithm with the trick of expected gradient and
develop a novel second-order online learning algorithm, i.e., Online Newton
Step with Expected Gradient (ONSEG). Theoretically, we show that the proposed
ONSEG algorithm significantly reduces the expected regret of OGDEG algorithm
from $\mathcal{O}(T^{5/6})$ to $\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ in the bandit feedback
scenario. Empirically, we further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
algorithm on multiple real-world datasets.

along the sequence (temporal direction) and along depth (spatial representation
direction), making it easier to train when building deep by balancing these two
directions; the other is the Overlap Coherence Training Scheme that reduces the
training complexity for long visual sequential tasks on account of the

  We provide empirical evidence to show that our deep RNN framework is easy to

develop a K-lines clustering algorithm, where K, the number of lines, can be

autoencoders by exploiting the rich information present in the past preference
history. We introduce a recurrent version of the VAE, where instead of passing
a subset of the whole history regardless of temporal dependencies, we rather
pass the consumption sequence subset through a recurrent neural network. At
each time-step of the RNN, the sequence is fed through a series of
fully-connected layers, the output of which models the probability distribution
of the most likely future preferences. We show that handling temporal
information is crucial for improving the accuracy of the VAE: In fact, our
model beats the current state-of-the-art by valuable margins because of its
ability to capture temporal dependencies among the user-consumption sequence
using the recurrent encoder still keeping the fundamentals of variational
autoencoders intact.

Action videos acquired in uncontrolled environments often contain corrupt
frames, which make actions partially observed. Furthermore, these frames can
last for arbitrary lengths of time and appear irregularly. They are
inconsistent with training data and degrade the performance of pre-trained
action recognition systems. We present an approach to address this issue. For
each training and testing actions, we divide it into segments and explore the
mutual dependency between temporal segments. This property states that the
similarity of two actions at one segment often implies their similarity at
another. We augment each segment with extra alternatives retrieved from
training data. The augmentation algorithm is designed in a way where a few
alternatives are good enough to replace the original segment where corrupt
frames occur. Our approach is developed upon hidden conditional random fields
and leverages the flexibility of hidden variables for uncertainty handling. It
turns out that our approach integrates corrupt segment detection and
alternative selection into the process of prediction, and can recognize
partially observed actions more accurately. It is evaluated on both fully
observed actions and partially observed ones with either synthetic or real
corrupt frames. The experimental results manifest its general applicability and
superior performance, especially when corrupt frames are present in the action
videos.

1 AU is presented. De-magnetised ions in the ion-inertial range of
quasi-neutral plasmas respond to Kolmogorov (K) or Iroshnikov-Kraichnan (IK)
inertial-range velocity turbulence power spectra via the spectrum of the
velocity-turbulence-related random-mean-square induction-electric field.
Maintenance of electrical quasi-neutrality by the ions causes deformations in
the power spectral density of the turbulent density fluctuations. Kolmogorov
inertial range spectra in solar wind velocity turbulence and observations of
density power spectra suggest that the occasionally observed scale-limited
bumps in the density-power spectrum may be traced back to the electric ion
response. Magnetic power spectra react passively to the density spectrum by
warranting pressure balance. This approach still neglects contribution of Hall
currents and is restricted to the ion-inertial range scale. While both density
and magnetic turbulence spectra in the affected range of ion-inertial scales
deviate from Kolmogorov or Iroshnikov-Kraichnan, the velocity turbulence
preserves its inertial range shape in this process to which spectral advection
turns out to be secondary but may become observable under special external
conditions. One such case observed by WIND is analysed. We discuss various
aspects of this effect including the affected wavenumber scale range,
dependence on angle between mean flow velocity and wavenumber and, for a
radially expanding solar wind flow when assuming adiabatic expansion at fast
solar wind speeds and a Parker dependence of the solar wind magnetic field on
radius, also the presumable limitations on the radial location of the turbulent
source region.

identify low-resolution faces with extremely low computational cost. To address
this problem, a feasible solution is compressing a complex face model to
achieve higher speed and lower memory at the cost of minimal performance drop.
Inspired by that, this paper proposes a learning approach to recognize
low-resolution faces via selective knowledge distillation. In this approach, a
two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) is first initialized to recognize
high-resolution faces and resolution-degraded faces with a teacher stream and a
student stream, respectively. The teacher stream is represented by a complex
CNN for high-accuracy recognition, and the student stream is represented by a
much simpler CNN for low-complexity recognition. To avoid significant
performance drop at the student stream, we then selectively distil the most
informative facial features from the teacher stream by solving a sparse graph
optimization problem, which are then used to regularize the fine-tuning process
of the student stream. In this way, the student stream is actually trained by
simultaneously handling two tasks with limited computational resources:
approximating the most informative facial cues via feature regression, and
recovering the missing facial cues via low-resolution face classification.
Experimental results show that the student stream performs impressively in
recognizing low-resolution faces and costs only 0.15MB memory and runs at 418
faces per second on CPU and 9,433 faces per second on GPU.

propose HashKV, which aims for high update performance atop KV separation under

deterministically maps values to storage space so as to make both updates and
GC efficient. We further relax the restriction of such deterministic mappings
via simple but useful design extensions. We extensively evaluate various design
aspects of HashKV. We show that HashKV achieves 4.6x update throughput and
53.4% less write traffic compared to the current KV separation design. In

addressed in the deep learning era. One compelling concern, however, gradually
arise along with the rapidly growing performance scores over existing visual
attention datasets: do existing deep models really capture the inherent
mechanism of human visual attention? To address this concern, this paper
proposes a new dataset, named VASUN, that records the free-viewing human
attention on solar images. Different from previous datasets, images in VASUN
contain many irregular visual patterns that existing deep models have never
seen. By benchmarking existing models on VASUN, we find the performances of
many state-of-the-art deep models drop remarkably, while many classic shallow
models perform impressively. From these results, we find that the significant
performance advance of existing deep attention models may come from their
capabilities of memorizing and predicting the occurrence of some specific
visual patterns other than learning the inherent mechanism of human visual
attention. In addition, we also train several baseline models on VASUN to
demonstrate the feasibility and key issues of predicting visual attention on
the sun. These baseline models, together with the proposed dataset, can be used
to revisit the problem of visual attention prediction from a novel perspective
that are complementary to existing ones.

training samples are annotated using only image-level labels that indicate the
presence or absence of an object category. In order to model the uncertainty in
the location of the objects, we employ a dissimilarity coefficient based
probabilistic learning objective. The learning objective minimizes the
difference between an annotation agnostic prediction distribution and an
annotation aware conditional distribution. The main computational challenge is
the complex nature of the conditional distribution, which consists of terms
over hundreds or thousands of variables. The complexity of the conditional
distribution rules out the possibility of explicitly modeling it. Instead, we
exploit the fact that deep learning frameworks rely on stochastic optimization.
This allows us to use a state of the art discrete generative model that can
provide annotation consistent samples from the conditional distribution.
Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 data sets demonstrate the
efficacy of our proposed approach.

turbulence only when the turbulent velocity fluctuations can practically be
completely neglected against the bulk flow speed. For low flow speeds the
transformation becomes rather involved. This account makes even no use of the
additional scale dependence of the turbulent frequency, viz. the existence of a

tracking and recognition in video surveillance. Although many background
subtraction (BGS) methods have been proposed in the recent past, it is still
regarded as a tough problem due to the variety of challenging situations that
occur in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we explore this problem from a
new perspective and propose a novel background subtraction framework with
real-time semantic segmentation (RTSS). Our proposed framework consists of two
components, a traditional BGS segmenter $\mathcal{B}$ and a real-time semantic
segmenter $\mathcal{S}$. The BGS segmenter $\mathcal{B}$ aims to construct
background models and segments foreground objects. The real-time semantic
segmenter $\mathcal{S}$ is used to refine the foreground segmentation outputs
as feedbacks for improving the model updating accuracy. $\mathcal{B}$ and
$\mathcal{S}$ work in parallel on two threads. For each input frame $I_t$, the
BGS segmenter $\mathcal{B}$ computes a preliminary foreground/background
(FG/BG) mask $B_t$. At the same time, the real-time semantic segmenter
$\mathcal{S}$ extracts the object-level semantics ${S}_t$. Then, some specific
rules are applied on ${B}_t$ and ${S}_t$ to generate the final detection
${D}_t$. Finally, the refined FG/BG mask ${D}_t$ is fed back to update the
background model. Comprehensive experiments evaluated on the CDnet 2014 dataset
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance
among all unsupervised background subtraction methods while operating at
real-time, and even performs better than some deep learning based supervised
algorithms. In addition, our proposed framework is very flexible and has the
potential for generalization.

different regions of phase space, under variation of parameters or initial
states. In this work we exploit this feature to obtain reliable logic
operations. With logic output 0 or 1 mapped to dynamical attractors bounded in
distinct regions of phase space, and logic inputs encoded by a very small bias
parameter, we explicitly demonstrate that the system hops consistently in
response to an external input stream, operating effectively as a reliable logic
gate. This system offers the advantage that very low-amplitude inputs yield
highly amplified outputs. Additionally, different dynamical variables in the
system yield complementary logic operations in parallel. Further, we show that
in certain parameter regions noise aids the reliability of logic operations,
and is actually necessary for obtaining consistent outputs. This leads us to a
generalization of the concept of Logical Stochastic Resonance to attractors
more complex than fixed point states, such as periodic or chaotic attractors.
Lastly, the results are verified in electronic circuit experiments,
demonstrating the robustness of the phenomena. So we have combined the research
directions of Chaos Computing and Logical Stochastic Resonance here, and this
approach has the potential to be realized in wide-ranging systems.

cumbersome, time-consuming and error-prone task. Believable crowds require the
effort of storytellers and programming experts working together for long
periods of time. In this work, we present a new framework to allow users to
generate populated environments in an easier and faster way, by relying on the
use of procedural techniques. Our framework consists of the procedural
generation of semantically-augmented virtual cities to drive the procedural
generation and simulation of crowds. The main novelty lies in the generation of
agendas for each individual inhabitant (alone or as part of a family) by using
a rule-based grammar that combines city semantics with the autonomous persons'
characteristics. Real-world data can be used to accommodate the generation of a
virtual population, thus enabling the recreation of more realistic scenarios.
Users can author a new population or city by editing rule files with the
flexibility of re-using, combining or extending the rules of previous
populations. The results show how logical and consistent behaviors can be
easily generated for a large crowd providing a good starting point to bring
virtual cities to life.

particularly easy to perform and its results have an important interpretation
with respect to quantum computation. The aim of the benchmark is to provide a
simple, useful parameter describing the quality of quantum control with an
experiment that can be performed in a standard way on any prospective quantum
computer. This parameter can be used to fairly compare different experiments or
to mark improvement in a single experiment.
  In this thesis I discuss first the original randomized-benchmarking procedure
and the importance of the Clifford operators for its implementation. I develop
the statistical analysis of the results and the physical assumptions that are
required for the simplest analysis to apply. The original procedure does not
extend in an obvious way to benchmarking of more than one qubit, so I introduce
a standardized procedure for randomized benchmarking that applies to any number
of qubits. This new procedure also enables the benchmarking of an individual
control operation. I describe two randomized-benchmarking experiments I helped
to design: one involved a single qubit and utilized a variation of the original
procedure and the second involved two qubits and demonstrated the new
procedure. I conclude with several potential extensions to the original and new
procedures that give them reduced experimental overhead, the ability to
describe encoded operations, and fairer comparisons between experiments.

for addressing the grand energy challenges of the 21st century. We fabricate
and characterize 75 unique halide perovskite-inspired solution-based thin-film
materials within a two-month period, with 87% exhibiting band gaps between 1.2
eV and 2.4 eV that are of interest for energy-harvesting applications. This
increased throughput is enabled by streamlining experimental workflows,
developing a set of precursors amenable to high-throughput synthesis, and
developing machine-learning assisted diagnosis. We utilize a deep neural
network to classify compounds based on experimental X-ray diffraction data into
0D, 2D, and 3D structures more than 10 times faster than human analysis and
with 90% accuracy. We validate our methods using lead-halide perovskites and
extend the application to novel lead-free compositions. The wider synthesis
window and faster cycle of learning enables three noteworthy scientific
findings: (1) we realize four inorganic layered perovskites, A3B2Br9 (A = Cs,
Rb; B = Bi, Sb) in thin-film form via one-step liquid deposition; (2) we report
a multi-site lead-free alloy series that was not previously described in
literature, Cs3(Bi1-xSbx)2(I1-xBrx)9; and (3) we reveal the effect on bandgap
(reduction to <2 eV) and structure upon simultaneous alloying on the B-site and
X-site of Cs3Bi2I9 with Sb and Br. This study demonstrates that combining an
accelerated experimental cycle of learning and machine-learning based diagnosis
represents an important step toward realizing fully-automated laboratories for
materials discovery and development.

  to Neutrosophic Hyperreals","19 pages",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  O the third version of this response-paper to Imamura criticism, we recall
that NonStandard Neutrosophic Logic was never used by neutrosophic community in
no application, that the quarter of century old neutrosophic operators (1995)
criticized by Imamura were never utilized since they were improved shortly
after but he omits to tell their development, and that in real world
applications we need to convert/approximate the NonStandard Analysis
hyperreals, monads and binads to tiny intervals with the desired accuracy,
otherwise they would be inapplicable. We point out several errors and false
statements by Imamura with respect to the inf/sup of nonstandard subsets, also
Imamura 'rigorous definition of neutrosophic logic' is wrong and the same for
his definition of nonstandard unit interval, and we prove that there is not a
total order on the set of hyperreals (because of the newly introduced
Neutrosophic Hyperreals that are indeterminate), whence the transfer principle
is questionable.

  Poverty Research for Small Areas",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Poverty mapping that displays spatial distribution of various poverty indices
is most useful to policymakers and researchers when they are disaggregated into
small geographic units, such as cities, municipalities or other administrative
partitions of a country. Typically, national household surveys that contain
welfare variables such as income and expenditures provide limited or no data
for small areas. It is well-known that while direct survey-weighted estimates
are quite reliable for national or large geographical areas they are unreliable
for small geographic areas. If the objective is to find areas with extreme
poverty, these direct estimates will often select small areas due to the high
variabilities in the estimates. Empirical best prediction and Bayesian methods
have been proposed to improve on the direct point estimates. However, these
estimates are not appropriate for different inferential purposes. For example,
for identifying areas with extreme poverty, these estimates would often select
areas with large sample sizes. In this paper, using databases used by the
Chilean Ministry for their Small Area Estimation production, we illustrate how
appropriate Bayesian methodology can be developed to address different
inferential problems.

  acoustic waves in standard single-mode fiber",,"Applied Physics Letters - Photonics 2, 041303 (2017)",,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An opto-electronic radio-frequency oscillator that is based on forward
scattering by the guided acoustic modes of a standard single-mode optical fiber
is proposed and demonstrated. An optical pump wave is used to stimulate
narrowband, resonant guided acoustic modes, which introduce phase modulation to
a co-propagating optical probe wave. The phase modulation is converted to an
intensity signal at the output of a Sagnac interferometer loop. The intensity
waveform is detected, amplified and driven back to modulate the optical pump.
Oscillations are achieved at a frequency of 319 MHz, which matches the
resonance of the acoustic mode that provides the largest phase modulation of
the probe wave. Oscillations at the frequencies of competing acoustic modes are
suppressed by at least 40 dB. The linewidth of the acoustic resonance is
sufficiently narrow to provide oscillations at a single longitudinal mode of
the hybrid cavity. Competing longitudinal modes are suppressed by at least 38
dB as well. Unlike other opto-electronic oscillators, no radio-frequency
filtering is required within the hybrid cavity. The frequency of oscillations
is entirely determined by the fiber opto-mechanics.
