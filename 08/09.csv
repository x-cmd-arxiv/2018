Phelps on
the G\^ateaux differentiability of Lipschitz functions on separable Banach
spaces to the non-separable case. The extension of the theorem is not possible
for general non-separable Banach spaces, as shown by Larman. Therefore, we will
work on some important non-separable spaces. We consider a norm of the
non-separable space $\ell^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$, showing that it complies with
the aforementioned theorem thesis. We also consider other examples as
$L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$ and $NBV[a,b]$, showing in all cases their sets of
$G$-differentiability and some properties of these sets. All of the above,
closely following the assumptions in Phelps Theorem, which will extend in the
case separable to functions with rank over the Asplund spaces and in the
non-separable case for projective limits and locally-Lipschitz cylindrical
functions.

galaxy surveys to interpret their data and constrain cosmological parameters.
While the increased depth of future surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope (LSST) will produce higher precision constraints, it will also
increase the fraction of sources that are blended. In this paper, we present a
Bayesian photometric redshift method for blended sources with an arbitrary
number of intrinsic components. This method generalises existing template-based
Bayesian photometric redshift (BPZ) methods, and produces joint posterior
distributions for the component redshifts that allow uncertainties to be
propagated in a principled way. Using Bayesian model comparison, we infer the
probability that a source is blended and the number of components that it
contains. We extend our formalism to the case where sources are blended in some
bands and resolved in others. Applying this to the combination of LSST- and
Euclid-like surveys, we find that the addition of resolved photometry results
in a significant improvement in the reduction of outliers over the
fully-blended case. We make available blendz, a Python implementation of our
method.

samples collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage
ring.
  Two enhancements are clearly visible in the cross section around 4.23 and
4.40~GeV.
  Using several models to describe the dressed cross section yields stable
parameters for the first enhancement, which has a mass of $4228.6 \pm 4.1 \pm
6.3 \un{MeV}/c^2$ and a width of $77.0 \pm 6.8 \pm 6.3 \un{MeV}$, where the
first uncertainties are statistical and the second ones are systematic.
  Our resonant mass is consistent with previous observations of the $Y(4220)$
state and the theoretical prediction of a $D\bar{D}_1(2420)$ molecule.
  This result is the first observation of $Y(4220)$ associated with an
open-charm final state.
  Fits with three resonance functions with additional $Y(4260)$, $Y(4320)$,
$Y(4360)$, $\psi(4415)$, or a new resonance, do not show significant
contributions from either of these resonances. The second enhancement is not
from a single known resonance. It could contain contributions from $\psi(4415)$
and other resonances, and a detailed amplitude analysis is required to better
understand this enhancement.

relevant geometrical features of the instruments. The application of Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) uncovered similarities between violin makers and their
respective copyists, as well as among luthiers belonging to the same family

approach, thin plate splines visualizations revealed that the average violin
outline has remained mostly stable over time, not adhering to any particular

employed for querying possibly unstructured and incomplete data. In this paper,
we advocate using ontologies not only to formulate queries and compute their
answers, but also for modifying queries by relaxing or restraining them, so
that they can retrieve either more or less answers over a given dataset.
Towards this goal, we first illustrate that some domain knowledge that could be
naturally leveraged in OBDA can be expressed using complex role inclusions
(CRI). Queries over ontologies with CRI are not first-order (FO) rewritable in
general. We propose an extension of DL-Lite with CRI, and show that conjunctive
queries over ontologies in this extension are FO rewritable. Our main
contribution is a set of rules to relax and restrain conjunctive queries (CQs).
Firstly, we define rules that use the ontology to produce CQs that are
relaxations/restrictions over any dataset. Secondly, we introduce a set of
data-driven rules, that leverage patterns in the current dataset, to obtain
more fine-grained relaxations and restrictions.

quantify the large-scale structure of interstellar clouds. In this paper, the
typical tools of multifractal analysis are applied to Herschel far-infrared
(70-500 $\mu$m) dust continuum maps, which represent an ideal case of study.
This dust component is a relatively optically thin tracer at these wavelengths
and the size in pixel of the maps is well suitable for this statistical
analysis. We investigate the so-called multifractal spectrum and generalised
fractal dimension of six Hi-GAL regions in the third Galactic quadrant. We
measure systematic variations of the spectrum at increasing wavelength, which
generally correspond to an increasing complexity of the image, and we observe
peculiar behaviours of the investigated fields, strictly related to the
presence of high-emission regions, which in turn are connected to star
formation activity. The same analysis is applied to synthetic column density
maps, generated from numerical turbulent molecular cloud models and from
fractal Brownian motion (fBm), allowing for the confrontation of the
observations with models with well controlled physical parameters. This
comparison shows that, in terms of multifractal descriptors of the structure,
fBm images exhibit a very different, quite unrealistic behaviour when compared
with Hi-GAL observations, whereas the numerical simulations appear in some
cases (depending on the specific model) more similar to the observations.
Finally, the link between mono-fractal parameters (commonly found in the
literature) and multifractal indicators is investigated: the former appear to
be only partially connected with the latter, with the multifractal analysis
offering a more extended and complete characterization of the cloud structure.

of the given object and the spring constant and was measured by measuring the
change in the induced voltage in secondary coils. The proposed sensor was
capable of measuring two contact parameters namely the applied force and the
stiffness of the object. Using the data of this sensor, three different

stronger than is possible with Nb-Ti and Nb3Sn, but two key limiting factors
have so far been the difficulty of achieving high critical current density in

quenches out of the superconducting into the normal state. Here we demonstrate
stable, reliable and training-quench-free performance of Bi-2212 racetrack
coils wound with a 17-strand Rutherford cable fabricated from wires made with
nanospray Bi-2212 powder. These multifilament wires are now being delivered in
single lengths of more than 1 km with a new record whole-wire critical current
density up to 950 A/mm2 at 30 T at 4.2 K. These coils carried up to 8.6 kA
while generating a peak field of 3.5 T at 4.2 K, at a wire current density of
1020 A/mm2. Quite different from the unpredictable training performance of
Nb-Ti and Nb3Sn magnets, these Bi-2212 magnets showed no training quenches and
entered the flux flow state in a stable manner before thermal runaway and
quench occurred. Also quite different from Nb-Ti, Nb3Sn, and REBCO magnets for
which localized thermal runaways occur at unpredictable locations, the quenches
of Bi-2212 magnets consistently occurred in the high field regions over a
conductor length greater than one meter. These characteristics make quench
detection rather simple, enabling safe protection, and suggest a new paradigm
of constructing quench-predictable superconducting magnets from Bi-2212, which
is, like Nb-Ti and Nb3Sn, isotropic, round, multifilament, uniform over km
lengths and suitable for Rutherford cable use but, unlike them, much more
tolerant of the energy disturbances that often lead Nb-based superconducting
magnets to premature quench and long training cycles.

gas in circumstellar disks are tested. The gas and dust are treated like
interpenetrating continuous media that can exchange momentum. A stiff coupling
between the gas and dust phases is typical for such disks, with the dust
stopping time much less than the characteristic dynamical time scale. This
imposes high demands on the methods used to simulate the dust dynamics. A grid,
piecewise-parabolic method is used as the basic algorithm for solving the
gas-dynamical equations. Numerical solutions obtained using various methods to
compute the momentum exchanges are presented for the case of monodisperse dust.
Numerical solutions are obtained for shock tube problem and the propagation of
sound waves in a gas-dust medium. The studied methods are compared in terms of
their ability to model media with (a) an arbitrary (short or long) dust
stopping time, and (b) an arbitrary dust concentration in the gas (varying the
dust to gas mass ratio from 0.01 to 1). A method for computing the momentum
exchange with infinite-order accuracy in time is identified, which makes it
possible to satisfy the conditions (a) and (b) with minimal computational
costs. A first-order method that shows similar results in the test computations
is also presented. It is shown that the proposed first-order method for
monodisperse dust can be extended to a regime when the dust is polydisperse;
i.e., a regime represented by several fractions with different stopping times.
Formulas for computing the gas and dust velocities for polydisperse dust with
each fraction exchanging momentum with the gas are presented.

classification techniques discard a large portion of the collected SAS

parts. For human consumption, the SLC is converted to a magnitude-phase
representation and the phase information is discarded. Even more problematic,
the magnitude information usually exhibits a large dynamic range (>80dB) and
must be dynamic range compressed for human display. Often it is this dynamic
range compressed representation, originally designed for human consumption,
which is fed into a classifier. Consequently, the classification process is
completely void of the phase information. In this work, we show improvements in
classification performance using the phase information from the SLC as well as
information from an alternate source: photographs. We perform statistical

formation (AGN feedback) in the centers of cool core clusters. The Phoenix
cluster is among the most massive clusters of galaxies known in the Universe.
It hosts a powerful starburst of several hundreds of Solar masses per year and
a large amount of molecular gas in the center. In this work we use the
high-resolution Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) on board XMM-Newton to
study the X-ray emitting cool gas in the Phoenix cluster and heating-cooling
balance. We detect for the first time evidence of O VIII and Fe XXI-XXII
emission lines, the latter demonstrating the presence of gas below 2 keV. We
find a cooling rate of 350 (-200,+250) Msun/year below 2 keV (at the 90%
confidence level), which is consistent with the star formation rate in this
object. This cooling rate is high enough to produce the molecular gas found in
the filaments via instabilities during the buoyant rising time. The line
broadening indicates that the turbulence (~ 300 km/s or less) is below the
level required to produce and propagate the heat throughout the cool core. This
provides a natural explanation to the coexistence of large amounts of cool gas,
star formation and a powerful AGN in the core. The AGN activity may be either
at a young stage or in a different feedback mode, due to a high accretion rate.

shows plateau behaviors at both short and long interval regions. This indicates
that the black hole microstates are indistinguishable from the thermal state by
measuring over a small region, and perfectly distinguishable over a region with
its size comparable to the whole system. In this letter, we demonstrate that
the plateaus are lifted by including the $1/c$ corrections from both the vacuum

dark energy in view of ongoing and future cosmological observations. If string
theory should be the ultimate quantum gravity theory, there is evidence that
exact de Sitter solutions with a positive cosmological constant cannot describe
the fate of the late-time universe. Even though cosmological models with dark
energy given by a scalar field $\pi$ evolving in time are not in direct tension
with string theory, they have to satisfy the Swampland criteria
$|\Delta\pi|<d\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $|V'|/V>c\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$, where $V$
is the scalar field potential. In view of the restrictive implications that the
Swampland criteria have on dark energy, we investigate the accuracy needed for
future observations to tightly constrain standard dark-energy models. We find
that current 3-$\sigma$ constraints with $c \lesssim 1.35$ are still well in
agreement with the string Swampland criteria. However, Stage-4 surveys such as
Euclid, LSST and DESI, tightly constraining the equation of state $w(z)$, will
start putting surviving quintessence models into tensions with the string
Swampland criteria by demanding $c<0.4$. We further investigate whether any
idealised futuristic survey will ever be able to give a decisive answer to the
question whether the cosmological constant would be preferred over a
time-evolving dark-energy model within the Swampland criteria. Hypothetical
surveys with a reduction in the uncertainties by a factor of $\sim20$ compared
to Euclid would be necessary to reveal strong tension between quintessence
models obeying the string Swampland criteria and observations by pushing the
allowed values down to $c<0.1$. In view of such perspectives, there will be
fundamental observational limitations with future surveys.

leading merging subclusters. While the Mach number of a shock can be estimated
from the observed density jump using Rankine-Hugoniot condition, it reflects
only the velocity of the shock itself and is generally not equal to the
velocity of the infalling subcluster dark matter halo or to the velocity of the
contact discontinuity separating gaseous atmospheres of the two subclusters.
Here we systematically analyze additional information that can be obtained by
measuring the standoff distance, i.e. the distance between the leading edge of
the shock and the contact discontinuity that drives this shock. The standoff
distance is influenced by a number of additional effects, e.g. (1) the
gravitational pull of the main cluster (causing acceleration/deceleration of
the infalling subcluster), (2) the density and pressure gradients of the
atmosphere in the main cluster, (3) the non-spherical shape of the subcluster,
and (4) projection effects. The first two effects tend to bias the standoff
distance in the same direction, pushing the bow shock closer to (farther away
from) the subcluster during the pre- (post-)merger stages. Particularly, in the
post-merger stage, the shock could be much farther away from the subcluster
than predicted by a model of a body moving at a constant speed in a uniform
medium. This implies that a combination of the standoff distance with
measurements of the Mach number from density/temperature jumps can provide
important information on the merger, e.g. differentiating between the pre- and
post-merger stages.

Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) as well as high-cadence,
multi-wavelength follow-up data from ground-based telescopes and Swift,
spanning from 56 days before peak light until 75 days after. The optical/UV
emission from PS18kh is well-fit as a blackbody with temperatures ranging from
$T\simeq12000$ K to $T\simeq25000$ K and it peaked at a luminosity of
$L\simeq8.8\times10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. PS18kh radiated
$E=(3.45\pm0.22)\times10^{50}$ ergs over the period of observation, with
$(1.42\pm0.20)\times10^{50}$ ergs being released during the rise to peak.
Spectra of PS18kh show a changing, boxy/double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission
feature, which becomes more prominent over time. We use models of
non-axisymmetric accretion disks to describe the profile of the H$\alpha$ line
and its evolution. We find that at early times the high accretion rate leads
the disk to emit a wind which modifies the shape of the line profile and makes
it bell-shaped. At late times, the wind becomes optically thin, allowing the
non-axisymmetric perturbations to show up in the line profile. The
line-emitting portion of the disk extends from $r_{\rm in}\sim60r_{\rm g}$ to
an outer radius of $r_{\rm out}\sim1400r_{\rm g}$ and the perturbations can be
represented either as an eccentricity in the outer rings of the disk or as a
spiral arm in the inner disk.

warm ionized gas showing line ratios similar to low-ionization nuclear emission

unsettled puzzle. Despite the uncertainty in the ionization mechanism, we argue
that we can still infer certain gas phase abundance pattern from first
principles. We show that the relative trend in N/O abundance can still be
reliably measured based on [NII]6548,6583/[OII]3726,3729 and a direct
measurement of the electron temperature. We construct a composite direct
temperature tracer that is independent of extinction correction, by combining
[OII] 3726,3729/[OII] 7320,7330 and [SII] 6716,6730/[SII] 4068,4076 and
canceling out the effect of extinction, as these involve the easiest-to-detect
auroral lines in quiescent galaxies. With theoretical modeling, we establish
the calibration for N/O based on [NII]/[OII] and a temperature tracer. We apply
this technique to quiescent galaxies in the nearby Universe and find they span
a range of 0.35 dex in N/O ratio from 17-percentile to 83-percentiles of the
whole distribution. These measurements can shed light on the chemical
enrichment history of the warm ionized gas in quiescent galaxies.

generic scalar field perturbations arising from smooth initial data have finite
energy at the Cauchy horizon even though they are not continuously
differentiable there. In this paper, we consider the analogous problem for
coupled gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations. We find that such
perturbations exhibit a much worse violation of strong cosmic censorship: for a
sufficiently large near-extremal black hole, perturbations arising from smooth
initial data can be extended through the Cauchy horizon in an arbitrarily
smooth way. This is in apparent contradiction with an old argument in favour of
strong cosmic censorship. We resolve this contradiction by showing that this
old argument is valid only for initial data that is not smooth. This is in
agreement with the recent proposal that, to recover strong cosmic censorship,
one must allow rough initial data.

galaxy formation implemented in the Millennium-WMAP7 N-body simulation. We
consider fixed number density galaxy samples ranked by stellar mass or star
formation rate. We investigate how the clustering of haloes and their galaxy
content depend on halo formation time and concentration, and how these
relationships evolve with redshift. At $z=0$ the dependences of halo clustering
on halo concentration and formation time are similar. However, at higher
redshift, halo assembly bias weakens for haloes selected by age, and reverses
and increases for haloes selected by concentration. The variation of the halo
occupation with concentration and formation time is also similar at $z=0$ and
changes at higher redshifts. In this case, the occupancy variation with halo
age stays mostly constant with redshift but decreases for concentration.
Finally, we look at the evolution of assembly bias reflected in the galaxy
distribution by examining the galaxy correlation functions relative to those of
shuffled galaxy samples which remove the occupancy variation. This correlation
functions ratio monotonically decreases with larger redshift and for lower
number density samples, going below unity in some cases, leading to reduced
galaxy clustering. While the halo occupation functions themselves vary, the
assembly bias trends are similar whether selecting galaxies by stellar mass or
star formation rate. Our results provide further insight into the origin and
evolution of assembly bias. Our extensive occupation function measurements and

of the injected energy is dissipated as heat in the baryon-photon plasma,
giving rise to the $y$-type, $i$-type, and $\mu$-type distortions in the CMB
spectrum. We show that this assumption is incorrect when the energy is injected
in the form of energetic (i.e. energy much greater than the background CMB
temperature) particles. We evolve the electromagnetic cascades, from the
injection of high energy particles, in the expanding Universe and follow the
non-thermal component of CMB spectral distortions resulting from the
interaction of the electromagnetic shower with the background photons,
electrons, and ions. The electromagnetic shower loses a substantial fraction of
its energy to the CMB spectral distortions before the energy of the particles
in the shower has degraded to low enough energies that they can thermalize with
the background plasma. This spectral distortion is the result of the
interaction of non-thermal energetic electrons in the shower with the CMB and
thus has a shape that is substantially different from the $y$-type or $i$-type
distortions. The shape of the final \emph{non-thermal relativistic}
($ntr$-type) CMB spectral distortion depends upon the initial energy spectrum
of the injected electrons, positrons, and photons and thus has information
about the energy injection mechanism e.g. the decay or annihilation channel of
the decaying or annihilating dark matter particles. The shape of the spectral
distortion is also sensitive to the redshift of energy injection. Our
calculations open up a new window into the energy injection at $z\lesssim
2\times 10^5$ which is not degenerate with, and can be distinguished from the
low redshift thermal $y$-type distortions.

known as Repeat-Until-Success. Differently from other non-deterministic quantum
operations, this procedure provides a classical flag which certifies the
success or failure of the procedure and, in the latter case, a recovery step
allows the restoration of the quantum state to its original condition. The
procedure can then be repeated until success is achieved. After success is
certified, the RUS procedure can be equated to a coherent gate. However, this
is not the case when the operation needs to be conditioned on the state of
other qubits, possibly being in a superposition state. In this situation, the
final operation depends on the failure and success history and introduces a
""distortion"" that, even after the final success, depends on the past outcomes.
We quantify the distortion and show that it can be reduced by increasing the
probability of success towards unity. While this can be achieved via oblivious
amplitude amplification when the initial success probability is known, we
propose the use of fixed-point oblivious amplitude amplification to reduce this
unwanted distortions below any given threshold even without knowing the initial

  bilinear saddle-point problems","submitted for publication",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  On solving a convex-concave bilinear saddle-point problem (SPP), there have
been many works studying the complexity results of first-order methods. These
results are all about upper complexity bounds, which can determine at most how
many efforts would guarantee a solution of desired accuracy. In this paper, we
pursue the opposite direction by deriving lower complexity bounds of
first-order methods on large-scale SPPs. Our results apply to the methods whose
iterates are in the linear span of past first-order information, as well as
more general methods that produce their iterates in an arbitrary manner based
on first-order information. We first work on the affinely constrained smooth
convex optimization that is a special case of SPP. Different from gradient
method on unconstrained problems, we show that first-order methods on affinely
constrained problems generally cannot be accelerated from the known convergence
rate $O(1/t)$ to $O(1/t^2)$, and in addition, $O(1/t)$ is optimal for convex
problems. Moreover, we prove that for strongly convex problems, $O(1/t^2)$ is
the best possible convergence rate, while it is known that gradient methods can
have linear convergence on unconstrained problems. Then we extend these results
to general SPPs. It turns out that our lower complexity bounds match with
several established upper complexity bounds in the literature, and thus they
are tight and indicate the optimality of several existing first-order methods.

  Our experiments on real world and synthetic networks highlight the

core-periphery structure of the network is such that each shell is an expander

  The main contributions of our paper are: (i) we demonstrate that the
formation of RCC is related to the core-periphery structure and particularly
the expander like properties of each shell, (ii) we show that the RCC property
can be used to find effective seed nodes for spreading information and for
improving the resilience of the network under perturbation and, finally, (iii)
we present a modification algorithm that can insert RCC within networks, while
not affecting their other structural properties. Taken together, these

rotating hairs. These black hole hairs could originate from the superradiant
growth of a light axion field around the rotating black holes. If a test
particle rotates around the black hole, its tidal field may resonantly trigger
the dynamical transition between a co-rotating state and a dissipative state of
the axion cloud. A tidal bulge is generated by the beating of modes, which
feeds angular momentum back to the test particle. Following this mechanism, an
extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral (EMRI) system, as a source for LISA, may face
delayed merger as the EMRI orbit stalls by the tidal response of the cloud,
until the cloud being almost fully dissipated. If the cloud depletes slower
than the average time separation between EMRI mergers, it may lead to
interesting interaction between multiple EMRI objects at comparable radii.
Inclined EMRIs are also expected to migrate towards the black hole equatorial
plane due to the tidal coupling and gravitational-wave dissipation. Floating
stellar-mass back holes or stars around the nearby intermediate-mass black
holes may generate strong gravitational-wave emission detectable by LISA.

Engineering (SE) tasks, e.g., bug localization and triaging, code retrieval,
requirements analysis, etc. The choice of similarity measure is the core
component of an IR technique. The performance of any IR method critically
depends on selecting an appropriate similarity measure for the given
application domain. Since different SE tasks operate on different document
types like bug reports, software descriptions, source code, etc. that often
contain non-standard domain-specific vocabulary, it is essential to understand
which similarity measures work best for different SE documents.
  This paper presents two case studies on the effect of different similarity
measure on various SE documents w.r.t. two tasks: (i) project recommendation:
finding similar GitHub projects and (ii) bug localization: retrieving buggy
source file(s) correspond to a bug report. These tasks contain a diverse
combination of textual (i.e. description, readme) and code (i.e. source code,
API, import package) artifacts. We observe that the performance of IR models
varies when applied to different artifact types. We find that, in general, the
context-aware models achieve better performance on textual artifacts. In
contrast, simple keyword-based bag-of-words models perform better on code
artifacts. On the other hand, the probabilistic ranking model BM25 performs
better on a mixture of text and code artifacts.
  We further investigate how such an informed choice of similarity measure
impacts the performance of SE tools. In particular, we analyze two previously
proposed tools for project recommendation and bug localization tasks, which
leverage diverse software artifacts, and observe that an informed choice of
similarity measure indeed leads to improved performance of the existing SE
tools.

further confirmation recently with a reanalysis using newly collected data,
with the anomaly now at the $4.8\sigma$ level. In this letter we propose a
novel explanation which advocates a low-energy sector containing $Z^\prime$
bosons with GeV-scale masses and sterile neutrinos with masses around
$100$-$500$ MeV. We show that this scenario can provide an excellent spectral
agreement with the MiniBooNE low-energy excess in the form of
$Z^\prime$-mediated neutral current production of heavy sterile states, a
fraction of whose subsequent decay to $e^+e^-$ pairs are misidentified as
single electron-like electromagnetic showers. Our model inscribes itself in the
broad class of models in which sterile neutrinos are charged under novel
interactions, allowing new couplings to hidden-sector physics. Alongside the
electron-like MiniBooNE signature this model also predicts a novel,
low-background, signal in LArTPC detectors such as MicroBooNE consisting of two
distinguishable electron-like electromagnetic showers originating from a single
vertex with no associated hadronic activity.

segmentation of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. The retinal layer
boundary model consists of 9 open parametric contours representing the 9
retinal layers in OCT images. An intensity-based Mumford-Shah (MS) variational
functional is first defined to evolve the retinal layer boundary model to
segment the 9 layers simultaneously. By making use of the normals of open
parametric contours, we construct equal sized adjacent narrowbands that are
divided by each contour. Regional information in each narrowband can thus be
integrated into the MS energy functional such that its optimisation is robust
against different initialisations. A statistical prior is also imposed on the
shape of the segmented parametric contours for the functional. As such, by
minimising the MS energy functional the parametric contours can be driven
towards the true boundaries of retinal layers, while the similarity of the
contours with respect to training OCT shapes is preserved. Experimental results
on real OCT images demonstrate that the method is accurate and robust to low
quality OCT images with low contrast and high-level speckle noise, and it
outperforms the recent geodesic distance based method for segmenting 9 layers
of the retina in OCT images.

between the motion of the gas and the deformation of the material. This process
is relevant to a variety of natural phenomena, such as gas venting from
sediments and gas exsolution from magma. Here, we study this process
experimentally by injecting air into a quasi-2D packing of soft particles and
measuring the morphology of the air as it invades and then rises due to
buoyancy. We systematically increase the confining pre-stress in the packing by
compressing it with a fluid-permeable piston, leading to a gradual transition
in migration regime from fluidization to pathway opening to pore invasion. We
find that mixed migration regimes emerge at intermediate confinement due to the
spontaneous formation of a compaction layer at the top of the flow cell. By
connecting these migration mechanisms with macroscopic invasion, trapping, and
venting, we show that mixed regimes enable a sharp increase in the average
amount of gas trapped within the packing, as well as much larger venting
events. Our results suggest that the relationship between invasion, trapping,
and venting could be controlled by modulating the confining stress.

existing and emerging solutions towards addressing RAN congestion problem, and
then identify potential advantages, challenges and use cases for the

decomposition method, which reduces the computational cost to $O(R^2 N_d
\log^2N) +O(R^3 N_d \log N)$, where $R$ it is the rank of submatrices of the
H-matrix approximation, $N_d$ is the total number of degrees of freedom and $N$
is the number of elements. However, we lose the high accuracy of the SEM. Thus,
we solve the corresponding preconditioned system by using the H-matrix
approximation problem as a preconditioner, recovering the high order accuracy
of the SEM. The condition number of the preconditioned system is independent of
the polynomial degree $P$ and grows with the number of elements, but at modest
values of the rank $R$ is below order 10 in our experiments, which represents a
reduction of more than 11 orders of magnitude from the unpreconditioned system;
this reduction is higher in the two-sided fractional derivative compared to
one-sided fractional derivative. The corresponding cost is $O(R^2 N_d \log^2
N)+O(R^3 N_d \log N)+O(N_d^2)$. Moreover, by using a structured mesh (uniform
or geometric mesh), we can further reduce the computational cost to $O(R^2
N_d\log^2 N) +O(R^3 N_d \log N)+ O(P^2 N\log N)$ for the preconditioned system.
We present several numerical tests to illustrate the proposed algorithm using
$h$ and $p$ refinements.

  electronic structure of GaAs and GaP: from bulk to nanowires",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we show how to link the electronic structures of two III-V
systems, one a direct gap material, GaAs, and the other an indirect gap
material, GaP, from their bulks right down to the shape of thin nanowires. GaAs
and GaP bulk and nanowire systems are studied in the zincblende and wurtzite
structures both free of strain and subjected to biaxial strains perpendicular
to the [111]/[0001] direction. We provide an interpretation of the band
structure of nanowires, grown along the [111] (zinc-blende structure) and the
[0001] (wurtzite structure) directions, in terms of the bulk band structures of
the corresponding binary compounds. The procedure reveals the origin of the
valence and conduction valleys relevant to determine the nature (direct or
indirect) of the band gaps and the kind (direct and pseudodirect) of the
valence to conduction transitions. Thus, by calculating only the bulk bands it
is possible to describe the behavior of the nanowire bands even for very thin
nanowires. The effects on the band structures due to biaxial strain are
analogously analyzed, providing for bulk GaP the first results in literature.
The role of confinement, and surface relaxation, in determining the nanowire
electronic structure of thin nanowires are analyzed separately revealing that
the change in the nature of the band gap is due mainly to surface relaxation
effects, not confinement. We show that the change for indirect/direct of the
gap from the bulk to the 1D systems is mainly due to the competition between
the energies of bulk conduction valleys which are differently inuenced by
confinement and strain. While the main effect of confinement is to open all
gaps it is not necessarily the main cause of the direct/indirect change in the
nature of the electronic gap as instead is usually claimed in the literature.

sum of smooth and strongly-convex local cost functions. Recently, several
algorithms over undirected and directed graphs have been proposed that use a
gradient tracking method to achieve linear convergence to the global minimizer.
However, a connection between these different approaches has been unclear. In
this paper, we first show that many of the existing first-order algorithms are
in fact related with a simple state transformation, at the heart of which lies
the $\mathcal{AB}$ algorithm. We then describe \textit{distributed heavy-ball},
denoted as $\mathcal{AB}m$, i.e., $\mathcal{AB}$ with momentum, that combines
gradient tracking with a momentum term and uses nonidentical local step-sizes.
By simultaneously implementing both row- and column-stochastic weights,
$\mathcal{AB}m$ removes the conservatism in the related work due to
doubly-stochastic weights or eigenvector estimation. $\mathcal{AB}m$ thus
naturally leads to optimization and average-consensus over both undirected and
directed graphs, casting a unifying framework over several well-known consensus
algorithms over arbitrary strongly-connected graphs. We show that
$\mathcal{AB}m$ has a global $R$-linear rate when the largest step-size is
positive and sufficiently small. Following the standard practice in the
heavy-ball literature, we numerically show that $\mathcal{AB}m$ achieves
accelerated convergence especially when the objective function is
ill-conditioned.

the small change in reprocessing efficiency as the source flux decreases by a

component in the gamma-ray spectra of TeV-blazars. A robustly predicted
consequence of the presence of such a field is the existence of degree-scale
GeV-energy gamma-ray halos -- gamma-ray bow ties -- about TeV-bright active
galactic nuclei, corresponding to more than half of all radio galaxies.
However, the emitting regions of these halos are confined to and aligned with
the direction of the relativistic jets associated with gamma-ray sources. Based
on the orientation of radio jets, we align and stack corresponding degree-scale
gamma-ray images of isolated Fanaroff-Riley class I and II objects and exclude
the existence of these halos at overwhelming confidence, limiting the
intergalactic field strength to $<10^{-15}$~G for large-scale fields and
progressively larger in the diffusive regime when the correlation length of the
field becomes small in comparison to 1 Mpc. When combined with prior limits on
the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field, this excludes a purely
magnetic explanation for the absence of halos. Thus, it requires the existence
of novel physical processes that preempt the creation of halos, e.g., the
presence of beam-plasma instabilities in the intergalactic medium or a drastic
cutoff of the very high energy spectrum of these sources.

and spread to other areas of research, including anthropology, biology,
information science, organizational studies, political science, and computer
science. Being it's objective the investigation of social structures through
the use of networks and graph theory, Social Network Analysis is, nowadays, an
important research area in several domains. Social Network Analysis cope with
different problems namely network metrics, models, visualization and
information spreading, each one with several approaches, methods and
algorithms. One of the critical areas of Social Network Analysis involves the
calculation of different centrality measures (i.e.: the most important vertices
within a graph). Today, the challenge is how to do this fast and efficiently,
as many increasingly larger datasets are available. Recently, the need to apply
such centrality algorithms to non static networks (i.e.: networks that evolve
over time) is also a new challenge. Incremental and dynamic versions of
centrality measures are starting to emerge (betweenness, closeness, etc). Our
contribution is the proposal of two incremental versions of the Laplacian
Centrality measure, that can be applied not only to large graphs but also to,
weighted or unweighted, dynamically changing networks. The experimental
evaluation was performed with several tests in different types of evolving
networks, incremental or fully dynamic. Results have shown that our incremental
versions of the algorithm can calculate node centralities in large networks,
faster and efficiently than the corresponding batch version in both incremental
and full dynamic network setups.

by measuring changes in the components of a gyroscopic spin axis. Although such
changes are of course small, they are large enough (\D S \sim 10^{-7}) that
they could conceivably be measured if the real universe behaved like the
McVittie spacetime. The real problem is that virialization will lead to domains
decoupled from the global expansion on a scale much larger than that of the

achieved using a custom-designed system-on-a-chip ASIC (LArPix) to uniquely
instrument each pad in a pixelated array of charge-collection pads. The LArPix
ASIC, manufactured in 180 nm bulk CMOS, provides 32 channels of
charge-sensitive amplification with self-triggered digitization and multiplexed
readout at temperatures from 80 K to 300 K. Using an 832-channel LArPix-based
readout system with 3 mm spacing between pads, we demonstrated low-noise
($<$500 e$^-$ RMS equivalent noise charge) and very low-power ($<$100
$\mu$W/channel) ionization signal detection and readout. The readout was used
to successfully measure the three-dimensional ionization distributions of
cosmic rays passing through a LArTPC, free from the ambiguities of existing
projective techniques. The system design relies on standard printed circuit
board manufacturing techniques, enabling scalable and low-cost production of
large-area readout systems using common commercial facilities. This
demonstration overcomes a critical technical obstacle for operation of LArTPCs

of rare events and is usually equal to the reciprocal of the mean of the
limiting cluster size distribution. We show how to build dynamically generated
stochastic processes with an Extremal Index for which that equality does not
hold. The mechanism used to build such counterexamples is based on considering
observable functions maximised at at least two points of the phase space, where
one of them is an indifferent periodic point and another one is either a
repelling periodic point or a non periodic point. The occurrence of extreme
events is then tied to the entrance and recurrence to the vicinities of those
points. This enables to mix the behaviour of an Extremal Index equal to $0$
with that of an Extremal Index larger than $0$. Using bi-dimensional point
processes we explain how mass escapes in order to destroy the usual relation.
We also perform a study about the formulae to compute the limiting cluster size
distribution introduced in \cite{FFT13,AFV15} and prove that ergodicity is
enough to establish that the reciprocal of the Extremal Index is equal to the
limit of the mean of the finite time cluster size distribution, which, in the
case of the counterexamples given, does not coincide with the mean of the limit

encoding a secret of arbitrary length $\ell$ among any $N \leq 2^\ell$ players
such that for a threshold parameter $t$, (i) the knowledge of any $t$ shares
does not reveal any information about the secret and, (ii) any choice of $t+1$
shares fully reveals the secret. It is known that any such threshold secret
sharing scheme necessarily requires shares of length $\ell$, and in this sense
Shamir's scheme is optimal. The more general notion of ramp schemes requires
the reconstruction of secret from any $t+g$ shares, for a positive integer gap
parameter $g$. Ramp secret sharing scheme necessarily requires shares of length
$\ell/g$. Other than the bound related to secret length $\ell$, the share
lengths of ramp schemes can not go below a quantity that depends only on the
gap ratio $g/N$. In this work, we study secret sharing in the extremal case of
bit-long shares and arbitrarily small gap ratio $g/N$, where standard ramp
secret sharing becomes impossible. We show, however, that a slightly relaxed
but equally effective notion of semantic security for the secret, and
negligible reconstruction error probability, eliminate the impossibility.
Moreover, we provide explicit constructions of such schemes. One of the
consequences of our relaxation is that, unlike standard ramp schemes with
perfect secrecy, adaptive and non-adaptive adversaries need different analysis
and construction. For non-adaptive adversaries, we explicitly construct secret
sharing schemes that provide secrecy against any $\tau$ fraction of observed
shares, and reconstruction from any $\rho$ fraction of shares, for any choices
of $0 \leq \tau < \rho \leq 1$. Our construction achieves secret length
$N(\rho-\tau-o(1))$, which we show to be optimal. For adaptive adversaries, we
construct explicit schemes attaining a secret length $\Omega(N(\rho-\tau))$.

deploy, update, monitor, and manage. The number of VNF instances, similar to
generic computing resources in cloud, can be easily scaled based on load.
Hence, auto-scaling (of resources without human intervention) has been
receiving attention. Prior studies on auto-scaling use measured network traffic
load to dynamically react to traffic changes. In this study, we propose a
proactive Machine Learning (ML) based approach to perform auto-scaling of VNFs
in response to dynamic traffic changes. Our proposed ML classifier learns from
past VNF scaling decisions and seasonal/spatial behavior of network traffic
load to generate scaling decisions ahead of time. Compared to existing
approaches for ML-based auto-scaling, our study explores how the properties
(e.g., start-up time) of underlying virtualization technology impacts Quality
of Service (QoS) and cost savings. We consider four different virtualization
technologies: Xen and KVM, based on hypervisor virtualization, and Docker and
LXC, based on container virtualization. Our results show promising accuracy of
the ML classifier using real data collected from a private ISP. We report
in-depth analysis of the learning process (learning-curve analysis), feature
ranking (feature selection, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), etc.), impact
of different sets of features, training time, and testing time. Our results
show how the proposed methods improve QoS and reduce operational cost for
network owners. We also demonstrate a practical use-case example

thorough exploration is lacking. Two representative burn resistant alloys are
considered, including Ti14(Ti-13Cu-1Al-0.2Si) and
Ti40(Ti-25V-15Cr-0.2Si)alloys. Compared with the commercial non-burn resistant

burning product zone and heat affected zone, which consumes oxygen by producing
Cu-O compounds and impedes the reaction with Ti-matrix. This work has
established a fundamental understanding of burning resistant mechanisms for
titanium alloys. Importantly, it is found that Cu could endow titanium alloys

cost-effective avenue to design burn resistant titanium alloys.

The Ricci curvature is defined by localizing heat traces suitably.
Equivalerntly, it can be defined through special values of localized spectral

attention both in experiments and calculations. Obviously, new feature in
thermal properties is of primary importance for application of graphene-based
materials in thermal management in nanoscale. Here, we studied the thermal
conductivity of graphene helicoid, a newly reported graphene-related
nanostructure, using molecular dynamics simulation. Interestingly, in contrast
to the converged cross-plane thermal conductivity in multi-layer graphene,
axial thermal conductivity of graphene helicoid keeps increasing with thickness
with a power law scaling relationship, which is a consequence of the divergent
in-plane thermal conductivity of two-dimensional graphene. Moreover, the large
overlap between adjacent layers in graphene helicoid also promotes higher
thermal conductivity than multi-layer graphene. Furthermore, in the small
strain regime (< 10%), compressive strain can effectively increase the thermal
conductivity of graphene helicoid, while in the ultra large strain regime
(~100% to 500%), tensile strain does not decrease the heat current, unlike that
in generic solid-state materials. Our results reveal that the divergence in
thermal conductivity, associated with the anomalous strain dependence and the
unique structural flexibility, make graphene helicoid a new platform for
studying fascinating phenomena of key relevance to the scientific understanding
and technological applications of graphene-related materials.

map between inputs given by stencils of the vorticity and the streamfunction
along with information from two well-known eddy-viscosity kernels. Through this
we predict the sub-grid vorticity forcing in a temporally and spatially dynamic

we present an extensive hyper-parameter optimization analysis in addition to
learning quantification through probability density function based validation

framework for flow evolution in a classical decaying two-dimensional turbulence
test case in the presence of errors related to temporal and spatial
discretization. Statistical assessments in the form of angle-averaged kinetic
energy spectra demonstrate the promise of the proposed methodology for sub-grid
quantity inference. In addition, it is also observed that some measure of
a-posteriori error must be considered during optimal model selection for
greater accuracy. The results in this article thus represent a promising
development in the formalization of a framework for generation of

show the H$\alpha$-like emission in their nebular spectra. The luminosity of
the H$\alpha$-like emission shows a tight correlation with the light curve peak
magnitude, sharing the same behavior with other nebular lines. This result
indicates that the H$\alpha$-like emission is powered by the radiative decay of
$^{56}$Co. The line flux is then expected to roughly follow the mass of the
emitting layer. The variation expected from the diversity of the H-rich
envelope mass among SNe IIb (reaching nearly to an order of magnitude) is
however not seen, suggesting that it is most likely contributed predominantly
by [N II], not by H$\alpha$. While further analysis is limited by the available
sample size, we find a hint that SNe IIb with a double-peak light curve, which
is interpreted as an outcome of the more extended and massive hydrogen
envelope, tend to show excess in the luminosity of the H$\alpha$-like feature
than those with a single-peak light curve. This behavior indicates possible
additional contribution from H$\alpha$. Additionally, we also find a
correlation between the [Ca II]/[O I] ratio and the post-maximum decline rate,

as a Gaussian stochastic background from output signals of future space-borne
interferometers, like LISA and ASTROD. As the target of detection, the
analytical spectrum of RGWs generated during inflation is described by three
parameters: the tensor-scalar ratio, the spectral index and the running index.
For RGW detection, we analyze the auto-correlated signals for a single
interferometer, and the cross-correlated, integrated as well as un-integrated
signals for a pair of interferometers, and give SNR for RGW, and obtain lower
limits of the RGW parameters that can be detected. By suppressing noise level,
a pair has a sensitivity 2 orders better than a single for one year
observation. SNR of LISA will be 4-5 orders higher than that of Advanced LIGO
for the default RGW. To estimate the spectrum, we adopt the maximum likelihood
(ML) estimation, calculate the mean and covariance of signals, obtain the
Gaussian probability density function (PDF) and the likelihood function, and
derive the expressions for the Fisher matrix and the equation of the ML
estimate for the spectrum. The Newton-Raphson method is used to solve the
equation by iteration. When the noise is dominantly large, a single LISA is not
effective for estimating the RGW spectrum as the actual noise in signals is not
known accurately. For cross-correlating a pair, the spectrum can not be
estimated from the integrated output signals either, and only one parameter can
be estimated with the other two being either fixed or marginalized. We use the
ensemble averaging method to estimate the RGW spectrum from the un-integrated
output signals. We also adopt a correlation of un-integrated signals to
estimate the spectrum and three parameters of RGW in a Bayesian approach. For
all methods, we provide simulations to illustrate their feasibility.

values that can be manipulated via callback functions. Stream-based programming
is exploding in popularity, as it provides a powerful and expressive paradigm
for handling asynchronous data sources in interactive software. However,
high-level stream abstractions can also make it difficult for developers to
reason about control- and data-flow relationships in their programs. This is
particularly impactful when asynchronous stream-based code interacts with
thread-limited features such as UI frameworks that restrict UI access to a
single thread, since the threading behavior of streaming constructs is often
non-intuitive and insufficiently documented.
  In this paper, we present a type-based approach that can statically prove the
thread-safety of UI accesses in stream-based software. Our key insight is that
the fluent APIs of stream-processing frameworks enable the tracking of threads
via type-refinement, making it possible to reason automatically about what
thread a piece of code runs on -- a difficult problem in general.
  We implement the system as an annotation-based Java typechecker for Android
programs built upon the popular ReactiveX framework and evaluate its efficacy
by annotating and analyzing 8 open-source apps, where we find 33 instances of
unsafe UI access while incurring an annotation burden of only one annotation
per 186 source lines of code. We also report on our experience applying the
typechecker to two much larger apps from the Uber Technologies Inc. codebase,
where it currently runs on every code change and blocks changes that introduce
potential threading bugs.

establish sufficient conditions for a column-regular binary matrix to satisfy

Next we derive universal \textit{lower} bounds on the number of measurements

optimal. Then we display two classes of binary matrices, namely parity check

optimal in the sense of almost satisfying the lower bound. In principle,
randomly generated Gaussian measurement matrices are ""order-optimal"". So we
compare the phase transition behavior of the basis pursuit formulation using
binary array codes and Gaussian matrices and show that (i) there is essentially
no difference between the phase transition boundaries in the two cases and (ii)
the CPU time of basis pursuit with binary matrices is hundreds of times faster

major applications is the X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT), which is
significant in modern health examination. The Radon inversion or image
reconstruction is challenging due to the potentially defective radon
projections. Conventionally, the reconstruction process contains several ad hoc
stages to approximate the corresponding Radon inversion. Each of the stages is
highly dependent on the results of the previous stage. In this paper, we
propose a novel unified framework for Radon inversion via deep learning (DL).
The Radon inversion can be approximated by the proposed framework with an
end-to-end fashion instead of processing step-by-step with multiple stages. For
simplicity, the proposed framework is short as iRadonMap (inverse Radon
transform approximation). Specifically, we implement the iRadonMap as an
appropriative neural network, of which the architecture can be divided into two
segments. In the first segment, a learnable fully-connected filtering layer is
used to filter the radon projections along the view-angle direction, which is
followed by a learnable sinusoidal back-projection layer to transfer the
filtered radon projections into an image. The second segment is a common neural
network architecture to further improve the reconstruction performance in the

dust affects the disk temperature by controlling absorption of starlight. As
grains grow from their initial ISM-like size distribution, settling depletes
the disk's upper layers of dust and decreases the optical depth, cooling the
interior. Here we investigate the effect of collisional growth of dust grains
and their dynamics on the thermal and optical profile of the disk, and explore
the possibility that cooling induced by grain growth and settling could lead to
gravitational instability. We develop a Monte Carlo dust collision model with a
weighting technique and allow particles to collisionally evolve through
sticking and fragmentation, along with vertical settling and turbulent mixing.
We explore two disk models, the MMEN (minimum-mass extrasolar nebula), and a
""heavy"" disk with higher surface density than the MMEN, and perform simulations
for both constant and spatially variable turbulence efficiency profile
$\alpha(R,z)$. We then calculate mean wavelength-dependent opacities for the
evolving disks and perform radiative transfer to calculate the temperature
profile $T(R,z)$. Finally, we calculate the Toomre Q parameter, a measure of
the disk's stability against self-gravity, for each disk model after it reaches
a steady state dust-size distribution. We find that even weak turbulence can
keep sub-micron sized particles stirred in the disk's upper layer, affecting
its optical and thermal profiles, and the growth of large particles in the
midplane can make a massive disk optically thick at millimeter wavelengths,
making it difficult to calculate the surface density of dust available for
planet formation in the inner disk. Also, for an initially massive disk, grain
settling and growth can produce a drop in the Toomre Q parameter, driving the
disk to $Q < 1.4$ and possibly triggering spiral instabilities.

embedding (amalgamation) in all cardinals $\ge \mu$. The question was raised if
the strongly compact upper bound was optimal.
  In this paper we prove the existence of an AEC $K$ that can be axiomatized by
an $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1,\omega}$-sentence in a countable vocabulary, so that
if $\mu$ is the first measurable cardinal, then
  (1) $K$ satisfies joint embedding cofinally below $\mu$ ;
  (2) $K$ fails joint embedding cofinally below $\mu$; and
  (3) $K$ satisfies joint embedding above $\mu$.
  Moreover, the example can be generalized to an AEC $K^\chi$ axiomatized in
$\mathcal{L}_{\chi^+, \omega}$, in a vocabulary of size $\chi$, such that
(1)-(3) hold with $\mu$ being the first measurable above $\chi$.
  This proves that the Hanf number for joint embedding is contained in the
interval between the first measurable and the first strongly compact. Since
these two cardinals can consistently coincide, the upper bound from [13] is
consistently optimal.
  This is also the first example of a sentence whose joint embedding spectrum
is (consistently) neither an initial nor an eventual interval of cardinals. By
Theorem 3.26, it is consistent that for any club $C$ on the first measurable

In this paper, we study the dynamics of capillary rise between two poroelastic

their order, relevant quantities and discarding irrelevant quantities. In this
paper, we present a novel approach for automatic arithmetic word problem
solving. Our approach starts with frame identification. Each frame can either
be classified as a state or an action frame. The frame identification is
dependent on the verb in a sentence. Every frame is unique and is identified by
its slots. The slots are filled using dependency parsed output of a sentence.
The slots are entity holder, entity, quantity of the entity, recipient,
additional information like place, time. The slots and frames helps to identify
the type of question asked and the entity referred. Action frames act on state
frame(s) which causes a change in quantities of the state frames. The frames
are then used to build a graph where any change in quantities can be propagated
to the neighboring nodes. Most of the current solvers can only answer questions
related to the quantity, while our system can answer different kinds of
questions like `who', `what' other than the quantity related questions `how
many'.

variation. The onset of instability and its physical mechanism are captured in
terms of the singular values of the propagator matrix corresponding to the
non-autonomous linear equations. We discuss two types of non-monotonic
viscosity profiles, namely, with unfavorable (when a less viscous fluid
displaces a high viscous fluid) and with favorable (when a more viscous fluid
displaces a less viscous fluid) end-point viscosities. A linear stability
analysis yields instabilities for such viscosity variations. In addition, we
also show that to understand the spatiotemporal evolution of the perturbations
it is necessary to analyse the viscosity gradient with respect to the
concentration and the location of the maximum concentration $c_m$. For the
favorable end-point viscosities, a weak transient instability is observed when
the viscosity maximum moves close to the pure invading or defending fluid. This
instability is attributed to an interplay between the sharp viscosity gradient
and the favorable end-point viscosity contrast. We demonstrate the
dissimilarity between the quasi-steady-state approach and NMA in finding the
correct perturbation structure and the onset, for both the favorable and
unfavorable viscosity profiles. The correctness of the linear perturbation
structure obtained from the non-modal stability analysis is validated through
nonlinear simulations. We have found that the nonlinear simulations and NMA
results are in good agreement. In summary, a non-monotonic variation of the
viscosity of a miscible fluid pair is seen to have a larger influence on the
onset of fingering instabilities, than the corresponding Arrhenius type

heterostructures have been intensively discussed. However, the role of these
phenomena in shaping the electronic properties in van der Waals
heterointerfaces has hitherto not been established. By reducing the material
thickness and forming a heterointerface, we find two types of charge-ordering
transitions in monolayer VSe2 on graphene substrates. Angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) uncovers that Fermi-surface nesting becomes
perfect in ML VSe2. Renormalization group analysis confirms that imperfect
nesting in three dimensions universally flows into perfect nesting in two
dimensions. As a result, the charge density wave transition temperature is
dramatically enhanced to a value of 350 K compared to the 105 K in bulk VSe2.
More interestingly, ARPES and scanning tunneling microscopy measurements
confirm an unexpected metal-insulator transition at 135 K, driven by lattice
distortions. The heterointerface plays an important role in driving this novel
metal-insulator transition in the family of monolayered transition metal
dichalcogenides.

pulsations in the Fe Ka emission appeared only in the first 7 ks of the

The presence of pulsed fluorescent lines is an unusual property in HMXBs. After
7 ks, the continuum flux increased by a factor of three, the Fe Ka flux
increased only by about 10\%, and the pulsating signal in the line disappeared.
Finally, in the second half of the observation, both the continuum and the line
flux dropped by a similar factor of 2. We suggest that the pulsating component
of the Fe Ka line is coming from a transient non-isotropic distribution of
dense gas around the neutron star, for example an accretion stream induced by
periastron passage, or from the illuminated surface of the donor star.

considers a convex relaxed $\ell_1$ minimization and is solved by a single

reduction results in a significant speedup of the new algorithms. Further, the

homogeneous isotropic body with a seismic-moment source of tensorial forces,
the source being localized both in space and time. The far-field waves provide
three equations for the sixth unknown parameters of the general tensor of the
seismic moment. Second, the Kostrov vectorial (dyadic) representation of the
seismic moment is used. Third, the fourth missing equation is derived from the
energy conservation and the covariance condition. The four equations derived
here are solved, and the seismic moment is determined, thus solving the inverse
problem in the conditions described above. It is shown that a useful picture of

seismic waves allow an estimation of the volume of the focal region, focal

the success of crowdfunding depends on network externalities, our research aims
to utilize them to provide an applicable referral mechanism in a

measuring the value of leading customers is chosen as the key to coping with
the research problem by considering that leading customers take a critical
stance in forming a referral network. Accordingly, two sequential-move game
models (i.e., basic model and extended model) were established to measure the
value of leading customers, and a skill of matrix transformation was adopted to
solve the model by transforming a complicated multi-sequence game into a simple
simultaneous-move game. Based on the defined value of leading customers, a
network-based referral mechanism was proposed by exploring exactly how many
awards are allocated along the customer sequence to encourage the leading
customers' actions of successful recommendation and by demonstrating two
general rules of awarding the referrals in our model setting. Moreover, the
proposed solution approach helps deepen an understanding of the effect of the
leading position, which is meaningful for designing more numerous referral
approaches.

pulses with vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting lasers. In our work, a
strong Kerr nonlinearity that is so far assumed to give rise to mode-locked
operation is evidenced and a strong nonlinearity enhancement by the microcavity
is revealed. We present wavelength-dependent measurements of the nonlinear
absorption and nonlinear-refractive-index change in a gain chip using the
Z-scan technique. We report negative nonlinear refraction up to 1.5E-11 cm2/W
in magnitude in the (InGa)As/Ga(AsP) material system close to the laser design
wavelength, which can lead to Kerr lensing. We show that by changing the angle
of incidence of the probe beam with respect to the gain chip, the Kerr
nonlinearity can be wavelength-tuned, shifting with the microcavity resonance.
Such findings may ultimately lead to novel concepts with regard to tailored
self-mode-locking behavior achievable by peculiar Kerr-lens chip designs for
cost-effective, robust and compact fs-pulsed semiconductor lasers.

coverage problem. We are given a ground set of elements and a set of bins. The
goal is to find a subset of elements along with an associated set of bins, such
that the overall cost is at most a given budget, and the profit is maximized.
Each bin has its own cost and the cost of each element depends on its
associated bin. The profit is measured by a monotone submodular function over
the elements. We first present an algorithm that guarantees an approximation
factor of $\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{e^\alpha}\right)$, where $\alpha \leq 1$
is the approximation factor of an algorithm for a sub-problem. We give two
polynomial-time algorithms to solve this sub-problem. The first one gives us
$\alpha=1- \epsilon$ if the costs satisfies a specific condition, which is
fulfilled in several relevant cases, including the unitary costs case and the
problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a knapsack
constraint. The second one guarantees $\alpha=1-\frac{1}{e}-\epsilon$ for the
general case. The gap between our approximation guarantees and the known
inapproximability bounds is $\frac{1}{2}$.
  We extend our algorithm to a bi-criterion approximation algorithm in which we
are allowed to spend an extra budget up to a factor $\beta\geq 1$ to guarantee
a $\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{e^{\alpha\beta}}\right)$-approximation. If we
set $\beta=\frac{1}{\alpha}\ln \left(\frac{1}{2\epsilon}\right)$, the algorithm
achieves an approximation factor of $\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon$, for any arbitrarily

survey. In particular we study ratios of auto and cross-correlations between
the two tracers as estimators of the ratio of their biases, a quantity that
should benefit considerably from the cosmic variance cancellation of the
multi-tracer approach. We show how well we should be able to measure the bias
ratio on very large scales (down to $\ell \sim 3$), which is crucial to measure
primordial non-Gaussianity and general relativistic effects on large scale
structure. We find that, in the absence of foregrounds but with realistic noise
levels of such surveys, the multi-tracer estimators are able to improve on the
sensitivity of a cosmic-variance contaminated measurement by a factor of $2-4$.
When foregrounds are included, estimators using the 21cm auto-correlation
become biased. However, we show that cross-correlation estimators are immune to
this and do not incur in any significant penalty in terms of sensitivity from
discarding the auto-correlation data. However, the loss of long-wavelength
radial modes caused by foreground removal in combination with the low redshift
resolution of photometric surveys, reduces the sensitivity of the multi-tracer
estimator, albeit still better than the cosmic variance contaminated scenario
even in the noise free case. Finally we explore different alternative avenues

completely-positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map is implemented. Finally, the

nearby, low-inclination, morphologically non-disturbed and unbarred Sa-Sc

core-collapse (CC) SNe, a significant difference appears when comparing their
R25-normalized radial distributions in long-armed grand-design (LGD) versus
non-GD (NGD) hosts, with that in LGD galaxies being marginally inconsistent
with an exponential profile, while SNe Ia exhibit exponential surface density
profiles regardless of the arm class. Using a smaller sample of LGD galaxies
with estimated corotation radii (Rc), we show that the Rc-normalized surface
density distribution of CC SNe indicates a dip at corotation. Although not
statistically significant, the high CC SNe surface density just inside and
outside corotation may be the sign of triggered massive star formation by the
DWs. Our results may, if confirmed with larger samples, support the large-scale
shock scenario induced by spiral DWs in LGD galaxies, which predicts a higher
star formation efficiency around the shock fronts, avoiding the corotation
region.

limited-capacity fronthaul we consider the problem of RRH-user association to
select a subset of users that can be served by each RRH. Moreover, different to
the conventional power consumption models, we take into account the dependence
of baseband signal processing power on the data rate, as well as the dynamics
of the efficiency of power amplifiers. The considered problem leads to a mixed
binary integer program (MBIP) which is difficult to solve. Our first
contribution is to derive a globally optimal solution for the considered
problem by customizing a discrete branch-reduce-and-bound (DBRB) approach.
Since the global optimization method requires a high computational effort, we
further propose two suboptimal solutions able to achieve the near optimal
performance but with much reduced complexity. To this end, we transform the
design problem into continuous (but inherently nonconvex) programs by two
approaches: penalty and \ell_{0}-approximation methods. These resulting
continuous nonconvex problems are then solved by the successive convex
approximation framework. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the

due to the unobserved individual effects bias. As a consequence, existing
methods remove the individual effects before change point estimation through
data transformations such as first-differencing. We prove that under reasonable
assumptions, the unobserved individual effects bias has no impact on the
consistent estimation of change points. Our simulations show that since our
method does not remove any variation in the dataset before change point
estimation, it performs better in small samples compared to first-differencing
methods. We focus on short panels because they are commonly used in practice,
and allow for the unobserved individual effects to vary over time. Our method
is illustrated via two applications: the environmental Kuznets curve and the
U.S. house price expectations after the financial crisis.

Models like cycle-consistent adversarial network (Cycle-GAN) and variational

without parallel data. However, due to the neural network architectures and
feature vectors chosen for these approaches, the length of the predicted
utterance has to be fixed to that of the input utterance, which limits the
flexibility in mimicking the speaking rates and rhythmic patterns for the

The obtained inequality is suitable for test of realism not only in quantum
mechanical systems, but also in quantum field systems.
  Also we propose a mathematically consistent derivation of the Leggett--Garg
inequality in Wigner form, which was recently presented in the literature, for
three and $n$ distinct moments of time. Contrary to these works, our rigor
derivation uses Kolmogorov axiomatics of probability theory. We pay special
attention to the construction and studies of the spaces of elementary outcomes.
Basing on the the Leggett--Garg inequality in Wigner form for $n$ distinct
moments of time we prove that any unitary evolution of a quantum system
contradicts the concept of macroscopic realism. We show that application of the
concept of macroscopic realism to any quantum system leads to ``freezing'' of
the system in the initial state.
  It is shown that for a particle with an infinite number of observables the
probability to find a pair of the observables in some defined state is zero,
even if the operators of these observables commute. This fact might serve as an
additional logical argument for the contradiction between quantum theory and
classical realism.

often host large internal electric dipoles and can accommodate heavy elements,
they also emerge as prime candidates to display Rashba spin-orbit coupling,
through which charge and spin currents may be efficiently interconverted.
However, despite a few experimental reports in SrTiO3-based interface systems,
the Rashba interaction has been little studied in these materials, and its
interplay with structural distortions remain unknown. In this Letter, we
identify a bismuth-based perovskite with a giant, electrically-switchable
Rashba interaction whose amplitude can be controlled by both the ferroelectric
polarization and the breathing mode of oxygen octahedra. This particular
structural parameter arises from the strongly covalent nature of the Bi-O

they provide complementary information on the epidemiology of a disease under
investigation. Existing statistical methods to combine prevalence data from
multiple diagnostics ignore the potential over-dispersion induced by the
spatial correlations in the data. To address this issue, we develop a
geostatistical framework that allows for joint modelling of data from multiple
diagnostics by considering two main classes of inferential problems: (1) to
predict prevalence for a gold-standard diagnostic using low-cost and
potentially biased alternative tests; (2) to carry out joint prediction of
prevalence from multiple tests. We apply the proposed framework to two case
studies: mapping Loa loa prevalence in Central and West Africa, using
miscroscopy and a questionnaire-based test called RAPLOA; mapping Plasmodium
falciparum malaria prevalence in the highlands of Western Kenya using
polymerase chain reaction and a rapid diagnostic test. We also develop a Monte
Carlo procedure based on the variogram in order to identify parsimonious
geostatistical models that are compatible with the data. Our study highlights
(i) the importance of accounting for diagnostic-specific residual spatial

the states with spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in a homogenous
manner. In this work, we consider a toy model of such category by adding a
special gauge-axion coupling to the bulk action. Firstly, we identify the
existence of spontaneous breaking of translations by the UV analysis. In the
absence of explicit breaking, the black hole solution is simply the same as the
Reissner-Nodstrom(RN) black holes, regardless of the non-trivial profile of the
bulk axions. The associated Goldstone modes exist only when the charge density
is non-zero. Then, we investigate the optical conductivity both analytically as
well as numercially. Our numerical result perfectly agrees with that for a
clean system, while the incoherent part gets modified due to the symmetry
breaking. The transverse Goldstone modes are dispersionless, which reflects the
fact that the solution is dual to a liquid state. Finally, the effect of
momentum relaxation to the transverse modes is also considered. In this case,
the would-be massless modes are pinned at certain frequency, which is another
key difference from unbroken phases.

[OIII] line luminosity, ionized gas excitation mechanism, ionization state and
electron density. We show that the radio-detected, mid-IR excess AGN constitute
the most luminous and highly ionized AGN in the local Universe and they
contribute primarily to the growth of black holes in the most massive galaxies.
At least half of this black hole growth is occurring in galaxies with recent
starbursts. The morphologies of these systems indicate that the starbursts have
probably been triggered by galaxy-galaxy mergers and interactions. The most
luminous AGN in our mid-IR excess sample have properties that are similar to
the Type II quasars studied at higher redshifts. In contrast, the control
sample constitute a class of lower ionization, less luminous AGN in more
quiescent galaxies that contribute primarily to the growth of low mass black

mass flux in the wall-normal direction is determined by the combination of
turbulent-diffusiophoretic diffusion due to composition gradients, and
diffusion due to gradients in other scalar fields (e.g. thermophoresis,
barophoresis, and forced diffusion). For inert mixtures, a balance must exist
between all the diffusive transport mechanisms so that the net diffusive mass
flux normal to the wall is zero everywhere. This paper discusses under which
conditions non-constant composition profiles are necessary to obtain
physico-chemical equilibrium, hence vanishing transport, in the wall-normal
direction. Mathematical modeling is employed to demonstrate how this may affect
fluid property profiles, wall heat flux, and wall shear stress in an ideal,
ternary gas mixture ($H_2 + N_2 + CO_2$) subject to a temperature gradient. It
is concluded that competing diffusive transport mechanisms, under certain
circumstances, may result in non-constant composition profiles and
significantly different wall and bulk compositions, for inert multicomponent
mixtures. Hence, wall-normal diffusion in the boundary layer must be accounted
for to correctly describe or interpret multicomponent flow systems sensitive to
wall friction and heat exchange.

methodology for identifying the nature of localised deviations from single-lens
point-source light curves, which ensures that 1) the claimed signal is
substantially above the noise floor, 2) the inferred properties are robustly

in the photometry, 3) there are no alternative viable solutions within the

be separated and robustly measured from the wing and the peak data,
respectively. We find matching model light curves that involve either a binary
lens or a binary source. Our binary-lens models indicate a planet of mass $M_2$
= (45 $\pm$ 9) $M_\oplus$, orbiting a star of mass $M_1$ = (0.35 $\pm$ 0.06)
$M_\odot$, located at a distance $D_\mathrm{L}$ = (1.7 $\pm$ 0.3) kpc from

(0.046 $\pm$ 0.007) $M_\odot$, located at a distance $D_\mathrm{L}$ = (5.7
$\pm$ 0.9) kpc, with the source potentially being a (partially) eclipsing
binary involving stars predicted to be of similar colour given the ratios
between the luminosities and radii. The ambiguity in the interpretation would
be resolved in favour of a lens binary by observing the luminous lens star
separating from the source at the predicted proper motion of $\mu$ = (1.6 $\pm$
0.3) mas yr$^{-1}$, whereas it would be resolved in favour of a source binary
if the source could be shown to be a (partially) eclipsing binary matching the
obtained model parameters. We experienced that close binary source stars pose a
challenge for claiming the detection of planets by microlensing in events where
the source passes very close to the lens star hosting the planet.

behavioural controllers that are capable of socially interact with animals.
Designing such behavioural bio-mimetic controllers remains an important
challenge as they have to reproduce the animal behaviours and have to be
calibrated on experimental data. Most animal collective behavioural models are
designed by modellers based on experimental data. This process is long and
costly because it is difficult to identify the relevant behavioural features
that are then used as a priori knowledge in model building. Here, we want to
model the fish individual and collective behaviours in order to develop robot
controllers. We explore the use of optimised black-box models based on
artificial neural networks (ANN) to model fish behaviours. While the ANN may
not be biomimetic but rather bio-inspired, they can be used to link perception
to motor responses. These models are designed to be implementable as robot
controllers to form mixed-groups of fish and robots, using few a priori
knowledge of the fish behaviours. We present a methodology with multilayer
perceptron or echo state networks that are optimised through evolutionary
algorithms to model accurately the fish individual and collective behaviours in
a bounded rectangular arena. We assess the biomimetism of the generated models

in which a single UI thread manages GUI rendering and event dispatching. Due to
this model, it is vital to avoid blocking the UI thread for responsiveness. One
common practice is to offload long-running tasks into async threads. To achieve
this, Android provides various async programming constructs, and leaves
developers themselves to obey the rules implied by the model. However, as our
study reveals, more than 25% apps violate these rules and introduce
hard-to-detect, fail-stop errors, which we term as aysnc programming errors
(APEs). To this end, this paper introduces APEChecker, a technique to
automatically and efficiently manifest APEs. The key idea is to characterize
APEs as specific fault patterns, and synergistically combine static analysis
and dynamic UI exploration to detect and verify such errors. Among the 40
real-world Android apps, APEChecker unveils and processes 61 APEs, of which 51
are confirmed (83.6% hit rate). Specifically, APEChecker detects 3X more APEs

testing time from half an hour to a few minutes. On a specific type of APEs,
APEChecker confirms 5X more errors than the data race detection tool,

topological invariants are manifested in robustness against perturbations.
Their most prominent feature is the emergence of topological edge states with
reduced dimension at the boundary between areas with distinct topological
invariants. The observable physical effect is unidirectional robust transport,
unaffected by defects or disorder. TIs were originally observed in the integer
quantum Hall effect for fermionic systems of correlated electrons. However,
during the past decade the concepts of topological physics have been introduced
into numerous fields beyond condensed matter, ranging from microwaves and
photonic systems to cold atoms, acoustics and even mechanics. Recently, TIs
were proposed in exciton-polariton systems organized as honeycomb lattices,
under the influence of a magnetic field. Topological phenomena in polaritons
are fundamentally different from all topological effects demonstrated
experimentally thus far: exciton-polaritons are part-light part-matter
quasiparticles emerging from the strong coupling of quantum well excitons and
cavity photons. Here, we demonstrate experimentally the first exciton-polariton
TI. This constitutes the first symbiotic light-matter TIs. Our polariton
lattice is excited non-resonantly, and the chiral topological polariton edge
mode is populated by a polariton condensation mechanism. We image real- and
Fourier-space to measure photoluminescence, and demonstrate that the
topological edge mode avoids defects, and that the propagation direction of the
mode can be reversed by inverting the applied magnetic field. Our
exciton-polariton TI paves the way for a variety of new topological phenomena,
as they involve light-matter interaction, gain, and perhaps most importantly -
exciton-polaritons interact with one another as a nonlinear many-body system.

technique is intrinsically limited by the stellar jitter due to the activity of
the star, because stellar surface inhomogeneities, including spots, plages and
convective granules, induce perturbations hiding or even mimicking the
planetary signal. This kind of noise is poorly understood in all the stars, but
the Sun, due to their unresolved surfaces. For these reasons, the effects of
the surface inhomogeneities on the measurement of the RV are very difficult to
characterize. On the other hand, a better knowledge of these phenomena can
allow us a step forward in our understanding of solar and stellar RV noise
sources. This will allow to develop more tools for an optimal activity
correction leading to more precise stellar RVs. Due to the high spatial
resolution with which the Sun is observed, this noise is well known for it.
Despite this, a link is lacking between the single observed photospheric
phenomena and the behavior of the Sun observed as a star. LOCNES (Low Cost NIR
Extended Solar Telescope) will allow to gather time series of RVs in order to
disentangle the different contributions to the stellar (i.e., solar) RV jitter.

response functions as in earlier treatments (G. Diezemann, Phys. Rev. E{\bf

reorientational motion of isolated molecules and extend the existing
calculations for the model of isotropic rotational diffusion to the model of
anisotropic rotational diffusion and to the model of rotational random jumps.
Depending on the values of some model parameters, we observe a hump in the
modulus of the nonlinear susceptibility for either of these models.
Interestingly, for the model of rotational random jumps, the appearance of this
hump depends on the way the coupling to the external field is modelled in the
master equation approach. If the model of anisotropic rotational diffusion is
considered, the orientation of the diffusion tensor relative to the molecular
dipole moment and additionally the amount of anisotropy in the rotational
diffusion constants determine the detailed shape of the nonlinear response. In
this case, the height of the observed hump is found to increase with increasing
'diffusional anisotropy'. We discuss our results in relation to the features
observed experimentally in supercooled liquids.

not aligned, some of the light will be coupled into the outer sensing fibers,
providing the position of the beam for tip-tilt correction. For this design we
show that there is a linear response in the sensing fibers when the beam is

underwater vehicles. Localization entails the determination of position of the
center of mass and orientation of a vehicle from the available measurements. In
this paper, we focus on localization by using One-Way Travel Time (OWTT)
measurements available to a vehicle from the communication of its multiple
on-board receivers with acoustic beacons, more specifically, long baseline
(LBL) beacons. Range can be inferred by multiplying the OWTT with speed of
sound; however, water conditions can change spatially and temporally resulting
in uncertainty in range measurement. The farther a beacon is from a receiver,
the larger is the uncertainty. The proposed method for localization accounts
captures this uncertainty by bounding the true distance with an increasing
(calibrating) function of the range measurement. Determination of this
calibration function is formulated as polynomial optimization problem and is a
crucial step for localization. The proposed two-step procedure for localization
is as follows: based on the range measurements specific to a receiver from the
beacons, a convex optimization problem is proposed to estimate the location of
the receiver. The estimate is essentially a center of the set of possible
locations of the receiver. In the second step, the location estimates of the
vehicle are corrected using rigid body motion constraints and the orientation
of the rigid body is thus determined. Numerical examples and experimental
results provided at the end corroborate the procedures developed in this paper.

communications with a finite data rate, where each node is associated with one
equation from a system of linear equations. Each node holds a dynamic state and
interacts with its neighbors through an undirected connected graph, where along
each link the pair of nodes share information. Due to the data-rate constraint,
each node builds an encoder-decoder pair, with which it produces transmitted
message with a zooming-in finite-level uniform quantizer and also generates
estimates of its neighbors' states from the received signals. We then propose a
distributed quantized algorithm and show that when the network linear equations
admit a unique solution, each node's state is driven to that solution
exponentially. We further establish the asymptotic rate of convergence, which
shows that a larger number of quantization levels leads to a faster convergence
rate but is still fundamentally bounded by the inherent network structure and
the linear equations. When a unique least-squares solution exists, we show that
the algorithm can compute such a solution with a suitably selected time-varying
step size inherited from the encoder and zooming-in quantizer dynamics. In both
cases, a minimal data rate is shown to be enough for guaranteeing the desired
convergence when the step sizes are properly chosen. These results assure the
applicability of various network linear equation solvers in the literature when
peer-to-peer communication is digital.

blob-based models can equilibrate melts of high-molecular-weight polymers,
described with chemically specific, atomistic, models. The central idea behind
these strategies, is first to represent polymers by chains of large soft blobs
(spheres) and efficiently equilibrate the melt on mesoscopic scale. Then, the
degrees of freedom of more detailed models are reinserted step by step. The
procedure terminates when the atomistic description is reached. Reinsertions
are feasible computationally because the fine-grained melt must be
re-equilibrated only locally. To develop the method, we choose a polymer with
sufficient complexity. We consider polystyrene (PS), characterized by
stereochemistry and bulky side groups. Our backmapping strategy bridges
mesoscopic and atomistic scales by incorporating a blob-based, a moderately CG,
and a united-atom model of PS. We demonstrate that the generic blob-based model
can be parameterized to reproduce the mesoscale properties of a specific
polymer -- here PS. The moderately CG model captures stereochemistry. To
perform backmapping we improve and adjust several fine-graining techniques. We
prove equilibration of backmapped PS melts by comparing their structural and
conformational properties with reference data from smaller systems,
equilibrated with less efficient methods.

mechanical master equation for the electronic and nuclear spin density
operator. The electron spin state selective (singlet and triplet) recombination
processes are described with a Haberkorn reaction term in this master equation.
Here we consider a general spin state selective electron transfer reaction of a
radical pair and use Nakajima-Zwanzig theory to derive the master equation for
the spin density operator, thereby elucidating the relationship between
non-adiabatic reaction rate theory and the Haberkorn reaction term. A second
order perturbation theory treatment of the diabatic coupling naturally results
in the Haberkorn master equation with an additional reactive scalar electron
spin coupling term. This term has been neglected in previous spin chemistry
calculations, but we show that it will often be quite significant. We also show
that beyond second order in perturbation theory, i.e., beyond the Fermi golden
rule limit, an additional reactive singlet-triplet dephasing term appears in
the master equation. A closed form expression for the reactive scalar electron
spin coupling in terms of the Marcus theory parameters that determine the
singlet and triplet recombination rates is presented. By performing simulations
of radical pair reactions with the exact Hierarchical Equations of Motion
(HEOM) method, we demonstrate that our master equations provide a very accurate
description of radical pairs undergoing spin-selective non-adiabatic electron
transfer reactions. The existence of a reactive electron spin coupling may well
have implications for biologically relevant radical pair reactions such as
those which have been suggested to play a role in avian magnetoreception.

dispersion relations for conformal partial waves in the complex $\Delta$ plane,
the Lorentzian inversion formula and complex tauberian theorems to derive this
result. We check our formulas in a few examples (for CFTs and scattering
amplitudes) and find perfect agreement. Moreover, in these examples we observe
that the large $\Delta$ expansion works very well already for small $\Delta
\sim 1$. We make predictions for the 3d Ising model. Our analysis of dispersion
relations via complex tauberian theorems is very general and could be useful in
many other contexts.

two different points in space. In quantum mechanics the waves correspond to a
single quantum object, even as complex as a big molecule. An interference is
present as long as one cannot tell for sure which slit is chosen by the object.
The more we know about the path, the worse the interference. In the paper we
show that quantum mechanics allows for a dual version of the phenomenon:
self-interference of waves propagating through a single slit but at different
moments of time. The effect occurs for time-independent Hamiltonians and thus
should not be confused with Moshinsky-type time-domain interference, a
consequence of active modulation of parameters of the system (oscillating
mirrors, chopped beams, time-dependent apertures, moving gratings, etc.). The
discussed phenomenon is counterintuitive even for those who are trained in
quantum interferometry. For example, the more we know about the trajectory in
space, the better the interference. Exactly solvable models lead to formulas
deceptively similar to those from a Youngian analysis. There are reasons to
believe that this new type of quantum interference was already observed in
atomic interferometry almost three decades ago, but was misinterpreted and thus
rejected as an artifact of unknown origin.

PTF12glz. The SN was discovered and monitored in near-UV and R bands as part of
a joint GALEX and Palomar Transient Factory campaign. It is among the most
energetic Type IIn supernovae observed to date (~10^{51} erg). If the radiated
energy mainly came from the thermalization of the shock kinetic energy, we show
that PTF12glz was surrounded by ~1 solar mass of circumstellar material (CSM)
prior to its explosive death. PTF12glz shows a puzzling peculiarity: at early
times, while the freely expanding ejecta are presumably masked by the optically
thick CSM, the radius of the blackbody that best fits the observations grows at
~7000 km/s. Such a velocity is characteristic of fast moving ejecta rather than
optically thick CSM. This phase of radial expansion takes place before any
spectroscopic signature of expanding ejecta appears in the spectrum and while
both the spectroscopic data and the bolometric luminosity seem to indicate that
the CSM is optically thick. We propose a geometrical solution to this puzzle,
involving an aspherical structure of the CSM around PTF12glz. By modelling
radiative diffusion through a slab of CSM, we show that an aspherical geometry
of the CSM can result in a growing effective radius. This simple model also
allows us to recover the decreasing blackbody temperature of PTF12glz.
SLAB-Diffusion, the code we wrote to model the radiative diffusion of photons
through a slab of CSM and evaluate the observed radius and temperature, is made
available on-line.

costly and time-consuming, as affects are intrinsically subjective, subtle and

affective sample. Particularly, for affect estimation in the 3D space of
valence, arousal and dominance, each assessor has to perform the evaluations in
three dimensions, which makes the labeling problem even more challenging. Many
sophisticated machine learning approaches have been proposed to reduce the data
labeling requirement in various other domains, but so far few have considered
affective computing. This paper proposes two multi-task active learning for
regression approaches, which select the most beneficial samples to label, by
considering the three affect primitives simultaneously. Experimental results on
the VAM corpus demonstrated that our optimal sample selection approaches can
result in better estimation performance than random selection and several
traditional single-task active learning approaches. Thus, they can help
alleviate the data labeling problem in affective computing, i.e., better

novel approach to align EEG trials from different subjects in the Euclidean

a new subject. Our approach has three desirable properties: 1) it aligns the
EEG trials directly in the Euclidean space, and any signal processing, feature

In binary classification, CSP seeks a set of filters to maximize the variance

traditional solution, and then a new solution based on a slightly different
objective function. We performed comprehensive experiments on motor imagery to
compare the two approaches, and found that generally the traditional CSP
