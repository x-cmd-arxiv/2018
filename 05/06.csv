and any putative underlying model of it satisfying the constraint of
KS-noncontextuality. A logical proof of the KS theorem is one that relies only
on the compatibility relations amongst a set of projectors (a KS set) to
witness this inconsistency. These compatibility relations can be represented by
a hypergraph, referred to as a contextuality scenario. Here we consider
contextuality scenarios that we term KS-uncolourable, e.g., those which appear
in logical proofs of the KS theorem. We introduce a hypergraph framework to
obtain noise-robust witnesses of contextuality from such scenarios.
  Our approach builds on the results of R. Kunjwal and R. W. Spekkens, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 115, 110403 (2015), by providing new insights into the relationship
between the structure of a contextuality scenario and the associated
noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities that witness contextuality. The
present work also forms a necessary counterpart to the framework presented in
R. Kunjwal, Quantum 3, 184 (2019), which only applies to KS-colourable
contextuality scenarios, i.e., those which do not admit logical proofs of the
KS theorem but do admit statistical proofs.
  We rely on a single hypergraph invariant, defined in R. Kunjwal, Quantum 3,
184 (2019), that appears in our contextuality witnesses, namely, the weighted
max-predictability. The present work can also be viewed as a study of this
invariant. Significantly, unlike the case of R. Kunjwal, Quantum 3, 184 (2019),
none of the graph invariants from the graph-theoretic framework for
KS-contextuality due to Cabello, Severini, and Winter (the ""CSW framework"",

Second, the skin color is far from faithful to the original one which is

In this work we address the following question: can we count the copies of $H$
faster if $G$ is sparse? We answer in the affirmative by introducing a novel
tree-like decomposition for directed acyclic graphs, inspired by the classic
tree decomposition for undirected graphs. This decomposition gives a dynamic
program for counting the homomorphisms of $H$ in $G$ by exploiting the
degeneracy of $G$, which allows us to beat the state-of-the-art subgraph
counting algorithms when $G$ is sparse enough. For example, we can count the
induced copies of any $k$-node pattern $H$ in time $2^{O(k^2)} O(n^{0.25k + 2}
\log n)$ if $G$ has bounded degeneracy, and in time $2^{O(k^2)} O(n^{0.625k +
1} \log n)$ if $G$ has bounded average degree. These bounds are instantiations
of a more general result, parameterized by the degeneracy of $G$ and the
structure of $H$, which generalizes classic bounds on counting cliques and
complete bipartite graphs. We also give lower bounds based on the Exponential
Time Hypothesis, showing that our results are actually a characterization of

fundamental and challenging task. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as
fully convolutional network (FCN) and SegNet, have shown outstanding
performance in many segmentation tasks. One key pillar of these successes is
mining useful information from features in convolutional layers for producing
high resolution segmentation maps. For example, FCN nonlinearly combines
high-level features extracted from last convolutional layers; whereas SegNet
utilizes a deconvolutional network which takes as input only coarse, high-level
feature maps of the last convolutional layer. However, how to better fuse
multi-level convolutional feature maps for semantic segmentation of remote
sensing images is underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel bidirectional
network called recurrent network in fully convolutional network (RiFCN), which
is end-to-end trainable. It has a forward stream and a backward stream. The
former is a classification CNN architecture for feature extraction, which takes
an input image and produces multi-level convolutional feature maps from shallow
to deep; while in the later, to achieve accurate boundary inference and
semantic segmentation, boundary-aware high resolution feature maps in shallower
layers and high-level but low-resolution features are recursively embedded into
the learning framework (from deep to shallow) to generate a fused feature
representation that draws a holistic picture of not only high-level semantic
information but also low-level fine-grained details. Experimental results on
two widely-used high resolution remote sensing data sets for semantic
segmentation tasks, ISPRS Potsdam and Inria Aerial Image Labeling Data Set,
demonstrate competitive performance obtained by the proposed methodology

unconventional and consistent with a sign-changing order parameter, such as a

shows a dip at zero externally applied magnetic field, which is an
incontrovertible signature of the simultaneous existence of 0 and $\pi$

consistency strength. However, it is possible to construct descending chains of
artificial theories with respect to consistency strength. We provide an
explanation of this well-orderness phenomenon by studying a coarsening of the
consistency strength order, namely, the $\Pi^1_1$ reflection strength order. We
prove that there are no descending sequences of $\Pi^1_1$ sound extensions of
$\mathsf{ACA}_0$ in this order. Accordingly, we can attach a rank in this
order, which we call reflection rank, to any $\Pi^1_1$ sound extension of
$\mathsf{ACA}_0$. We prove that for any $\Pi^1_1$ sound theory $T$ extending
$\mathsf{ACA}_0^+$, the reflection rank of $T$ equals the proof-theoretic
ordinal of $T$. We also prove that the proof-theoretic ordinal of $\alpha$
iterated $\Pi^1_1$ reflection is $\varepsilon_\alpha$. Finally, we use our
results to provide straightforward well-foundedness proofs of ordinal notation

platform released to open-source and hosted by the Linux Foundation. The

applications like supply-chains, financial transactions, asset management, food
safety, and many more. For that end HLF introduces several innovations, two of
which are smart contracts in general purpose languages (\emph{chaincode} in
HLF), and flexible endorsement policies, which govern whether a transaction is
considered valid.
  Typical blockchain applications are comprised of two tiers: the first tier
focuses on the modelling of the data schema and embedding of business rules
into the blockchain by means of smart contracts (\emph{chaincode}) and
endorsment policies; and the second tier uses the SDK (Software Development
Kit) provided by HLF to implement client side application logic.
  However there is a gap between the two tiers that hinders the rapid adoption
of changes in the chaincode and endorsement policies within the client SDK.
Currently, the chaincode location and endorsement policies are statically
configured into the client SDK. This limits the reliability and availability of
the client in the event of changes in the platform, and makes the platform more
difficult to use. In this work we address and bridge the gap by describing the
design and implementation of \emph{Service Discovery}.
  \emph{Service Discovery} provides APIs which allow dynamic discovery of the
configuration required for the client SDK to interact with the platform,
alleviating the client from the burden of maintaining it. This enables the
client to rapidly adapt to changes in the platform, thus significantly
improving the reliability of the application layer. It also makes the HLF
platform more consumable, simplifying the job of creating blockchain
applications.

of batch arrivals on infinite server queues. We assume that the arrival epochs
occur according to a Poisson process, with treatment of both stationary and
non-stationary arrival rates. We consider both exponentially and generally
distributed service durations and we analyze both fixed and random arrival
batch sizes. In addition to deriving the transient mean, variance, and moment
generating function for time-varying arrival rates, we also find that the
steady-state distribution of the queue is equivalent to the sum of scaled
Poisson random variables with rates proportional to the order statistics of its
service distribution. We do so through viewing the batch arrival system as a
collection of correlated sub-queues. Furthermore, we investigate the limiting
behavior of the process through a batch scaling of the queue and through fluid
and diffusion limits of the arrival rate. In the course of our analysis, we
make important connections between our model and the harmonic numbers,

Spanwise-periodic flows over the airfoil at a chord-based Reynolds number of

post-stall angles of attack of $6^\circ$ and $9^\circ$. Near the leading edge,
localized unsteady thermal actuation is introduced in an open-loop manner with
two tunable parameters of actuation frequency and spanwise wavelength. For the
most successful control case that achieves full reattachment, we observe a
reduction in drag by up to $49\%$ and increase in lift by up to $54\%$. To
provide physics-based guidance for the effective choice of these control input
parameters, we conduct global resolvent analysis on the baseline turbulent mean
flows to identify the actuation frequency and wavenumber that provide high
energy amplification. The present analysis also considers the use of a temporal
filter to limit the time horizon for assessing the energy amplification to
extend resolvent analysis to unstable base flows. We incorporate the
amplification and response mode from resolvent analysis to provide a metric
that quantifies momentum mixing associated with the modal structure. By
comparing this metric from resolvent analysis and the LES results of controlled
flows, we demonstrate that resolvent analysis can predict the effective range
of actuation frequency as well as the global response to the actuation input.
Supported by the agreements between the results from resolvent analysis and
LES, we believe that this study provides insights for the use of resolvent

robust biomimetic materials. While many deterministic studies clarified these
advantageous features in the mean sense, a closed-form statistical model is
indispensable for determining the tail probability of failure in the range of 1
in a million, which is what is demanded for most engineering applications. In
the authors' preceding study, the so-called `fishnet' statistics, exemplified
by a diagonally pulled fishnet, was conceived to describe the probability
distribution. The fishnet links, representing interlaminar bonds, were
considered to be elastic perfectly-brittle. However, the links may be
quasibrittle or almost ductile, exhibiting gradual postpeak softening in their
stress-strain relation. This paper extends the fishnet statistics to links with
post-peak softening slope of arbitrary steepness. Probabilistic analysis is
enabled by assuming the postpeak softening of a link to occur as a series of
finite drops of stress and stiffness. The maximum load of the structure is
approximated by the strength of the k-th weakest link (k >= 1), and the
distribution of structure strength is expressed as a weighted sum of the
distributions of order statistics. The analytically obtained probabilities are
compared and verified by histograms of strength data obtained by millions of
Monte Carlo simulations for each of many nacreous bodies with different link
softening steepness and with various overall shapes.

Ohmic-like spectrum. It is found that the high temperature not only leads to
the speed-up but also speed-down processes in the weak-coupling regime, which
is different from the strong-coupling case where only exhibits speed-up
process, and the effects of Ohmicity parameter of the bath on the quantum
evolution speed are also different in the strong-coupling and weak-coupling

evolution speed by applying the bang-bang pulse. For the second nonlinear bath,
we study the quantum evolution speed of a qubit by resorting to the
hierarchical equations of motion method beyond the Born-Markov approximation.
It is shown that the performances of quantum evolution speed in weak-coupling

To the best of our knowledge, our method, called Quantization Mimic, is the
first one focusing on very tiny networks. We utilize two types of acceleration
methods: mimic and quantization. Mimic improves the performance of a student
network by transfering knowledge from a teacher network. Quantization converts
a full-precision network to a quantized one without large degradation of
performance. If the teacher network is quantized, the search scope of the
student network will be smaller. Using this feature of the quantization, we
propose Quantization Mimic. It first quantizes the large network, then mimic a
quantized small network. The quantization operation can help student network to
better match the feature maps from teacher network. To evaluate our approach,
we carry out experiments on various popular CNNs including VGG and Resnet, as
well as different detection frameworks including Faster R-CNN and R-FCN.
Experiments on Pascal VOC and WIDER FACE verify that our Quantization Mimic

Ensemble Network (SGEN) for multi-scale face restoration issue. We first employ
the principle of ensemble learning into SGEN architecture design to reinforce
predictive performance of the network. The SGEN aggregates multi-level
base-encoders and base-decoders into the network, which enables the network to
contain multiple scales of receptive field. Instead of combining these
base-en/decoders directly with non-sequential operations, the SGEN takes
base-en/decoders from different levels as sequential data. Specifically, the
SGEN learns to sequentially extract high level information from base-encoders
in bottom-up manner and restore low level information from base-decoders in
top-down manner. Besides, we propose to realize bottom-up and top-down
information combination and selection with Sequential Gating Unit (SGU). The
SGU sequentially takes two inputs from different levels and decides the output
based on one active input. Experiment results demonstrate that our SGEN is more
effective at multi-scale human face restoration with more image details and
less noise than state-of-the-art image restoration models. By using adversarial
training, SGEN also produces more visually preferred results than other models

only unanimous group exerts peer pressure on individuals. The novelty, in
relation to previous versions of the $q$-voter model, is memory possessed by
each agent and external noise $T$, which plays the role of social temperature.
Each agent has its own memories of past experiences related to the social costs
and benefits of being independent or conformist. If an agent was awarded in
past more for being independent, it will have a greater tendency to be
independent than conformist and vice versa. We will show that depending on the
social temperature $T$ the system spontaneously organizes into one of two
regimes. Below a certain critical social temperature $T_c$, all agents in the
society acquire personal traits (so called person state). Some of them become
permanent conformists and others start to behave forever independently. This
means that initially homogeneous population becomes heterogeneous, and agents
respond differently to social influence. For $T>T_c$, all agents with equal
probabilities behave independently or conform to peer pressure (so called
situation state). This regime change between person and situation state, which
reminds the idea of an annealed vs. quenched disorder, affects also public
opinion. Particularly interesting results are obtained for individualistic
societies, in which public opinion is non-monotonic function of $T$, which
means that there is an optimal social temperature for which an agreement in the
society is the highest.

Dissociation occurs either in the initially excited singlet manifold or, via
intersystem crossing, in the triplet manifold. Both product channels are
monitored and show that, despite being more rapid, the singlet dissociation is
the minor product and that triplet state products dominate the final yield. We
explain this by a consideration of accurate potential energy curves for both
the singlet and triplet states. We propose that rapid internal conversion
stabilizes the singlet population dynamically, allowing for singlet-triplet
relaxation via intersystem crossing and the efficient formation of

enhancement. Experimental validity of the methods used is illustrated by
qualitative and quantitative analysis on several images using the image quality
index - Average Information Content (AIC) or Entropy, and by comparison with
the commonly used algorithms such as Histogram Equalization (HE), Recursive
Mean-Separate Histogram Equalization (RMSHE) and Brightness Preserving Fuzzy

They are manifested by the excitation probability $\mathcal{P}$ and the excess

kinds of nodes: the so-called 'spider' associated with the computational basis,
as well as a new arity-N generalisation of the Hadamard gate, which satisfies a
variation of the spider fusion law. Unlike previous graphical calculi, this
admits compact encodings of non-linear classical functions. For example, the

substitution occurring in the coding region of a gene and leads to a change in
amino-acid sequence of protein. The studies have shown these variations may be
associated with disease. Thus, investigating the effects of nsSNPs on protein
function will give a greater insight on how nsSNPs can lead into disease.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women causing highest cancer
death every year. BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes are two main
candidates of which, mutations in them can increase the risk of developing
breast cancer. For prediction and detection of the cancer one can use
experimental or computational methods, but the experimental method is very
costly and time consuming in comparison with the computational method. The
computer and computational methods have been used for more than 30 years. Here
we try to predict the clinical significance of BRCA1 and BRCA2 nsSNPs as well
as the unknown clinical significances. Nearly 500 BRCA1 and BRCA2 nsSNPs with
known clinical significances retrieved from NCBI database. Based on
hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity and their role in proteins' second structure,
they are divided into 6 groups, each assigned with scores. The data are
prepared in the acceptable form to the automated prediction mechanisms,
Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Deep Neural NetworkStacked AutoEncoder
(DNN). With Jackknife cross validation we show that the prediction accuracy
achieved for BRCA1 and BRCA2 using PNN are 87.97% and 82.17% respectively,
while 95.41% and 92.80% accuracies achieved using DNN. The total required
processing time for the training and testing the PNN is 0.9 second and DNN
requires about 7 hours of training and it can predict instantly. both methods
show great improvement in accuracy and speed compared to previous attempts.

restricted but very expressive class of disjunctive temporal problems (DTPs).
It was shown that that RDTPs are solvable in deterministic strongly-polynomial
time by reducing them to the Connected Row-Convex (CRC) constraints problem;
plus, Kumar devised a randomized algorithm whose expected running time is less
than that of the deterministic one. Instead, the most general form of DTPs
allows for multi-variable disjunctions of many interval constraints and it is
NP-complete.
  This work offers a deeper comprehension on the tractability of RDTPs, leading
to an elementary deterministic strongly-polynomial time algorithm for them,
significantly improving the asymptotic running times of both the deterministic
and randomized algorithms of Kumar. The result is obtained by reducing RDTPs to
the Single-Source Shortest-Paths (SSSP) and the 2-SAT problem (jointly),
instead of reducing to CRCs. In passing, we obtain a faster (quadratic-time)

solving temporal problems having only Type-2 constraints and either only

log$g_1\sim8.7$ (which implies a mass of $M_1\sim1.06~{\rm M_\odot}$) and an
effective temperature $T_1\sim13000$ K, while the effective temperature of the
low-mass WD ($M_2<0.24$ {\rm M$_\odot$}) is $T_2\sim6400K$. Therefore, the
massive and the low-mass WDs have a cooling age $\tau_1\sim1$ {\rm Gyr} and
$\tau_2\geq5$ {\rm Gyr}, respectively. This is in contradiction with
traditional binary evolution theory. In this Letter, we propose a strange dwarf

Their heterogeneity is related mainly to different configurations of the

environments. We present photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2010bt, which was
classified as a Type IIn SN from a spectrum obtained soon after discovery and
was observed extensively for about two months. After the seasonal interruption
owing to its proximity to the Sun, the SN was below the detection threshold,
indicative of a rapid luminosity decline. We can identify the likely progenitor
with a very luminous star (log L/L_sun ~ 7) through comparison of Hubble Space
Telescope images of the host galaxy prior to explosion with those of the SN
obtained after maximum light. Such a luminosity is not expected for a quiescent
star, but rather for a massive star in an active phase. This progenitor
candidate was later confirmed via images taken in 2015 (~ 5 yr post-discovery),
in which no bright point source was detected at the SN position. Given these
results and the SN behavior, we conclude that SN 2010bt was likely a Type IIn
SN and that its progenitor was a massive star that experienced an outburst
shortly before the final explosion, leading to a dense H-rich circumstellar
environment around the SN progenitor.

stationary and dynamical bound states, with oscillating separation between the

state with the smallest separation gives rise the oscillatory state through the
Hopf bifurcation. Further growth of TOD leads to a bifurcation transforming the
oscillatory limit cycle into a strange attractor, which represents a
chaotically oscillating dynamical bound state. Families of multistable three-

already identified in DR2, we estimate the global offsets of parallaxes and
proper motions of different quasar subsets to check their astrometric
consistency. The features of the proper motion field are analyzed by means of
vectorial spherical harmonics (VSH); the scalar field of parallaxes is expanded
into spherical harmonics to investigate their spatial correlation. We find a
bias of $\sim$ $-0.030$ $mas$ in KQCG parallaxes, and a bias of $-9.1$ $\mu
as/yr$ in $\mu_{\alpha\ast}$; a $\sim$ +10 $\mu as/yr$ bias in $\mu_{\delta}$
consistently found in the entire quasar sample. The results of the VSH analysis
on different subsets indicate good agreement between them. The proper motion
field exhibits a ((-6,-5,-5) $\pm$ 1) $\mu as/yr$ rotation in the northern
hemisphere and a rotation of ((0,+1,+3) $\pm$ 1 ) $\mu as /yr$ in the southern
one. The spherical harmonics expansion of the parallax field reveals an angular
scale of systematics of $\approx$ 18 degrees with a RMS amplitude of 13
$\mu$as. The positional comparison shows that the axes of the current Gaia
Celestial Reference Frame and the ICRF2 are aligned within 30 $\mu$as.

essential infrastructure in today's big-data processing and cloud computing.
They rely on efficient index structures to access data. While unordered
indexes, such as hash tables, can perform point search with O(1) time, they
cannot be used in many scenarios where range queries must be supported. Many
ordered indexes, such as B+ tree and skip list, have a O(log N) lookup cost,
where N is number of keys in an index. For an ordered index hosting billions of
keys, it may take more than 30 key-comparisons in a lookup, which is an order
of magnitude more expensive than that on a hash table. With availability of
large memory and fast network in today's data centers, this O(log N) time is
taking a heavy toll on applications that rely on ordered indexes.
  In this paper we introduce a new ordered index structure, named Wormhole,
that takes O(log L) worst-case time for looking up a key with a length of L.
The low cost is achieved by simultaneously leveraging strengths of three
indexing structures, namely hash table, prefix tree, and B+ tree, to
orchestrate a single fast ordered index. Wormhole's range operations can be
performed by a linear scan of a list after an initial lookup. This improvement
of access efficiency does not come at a price of compromised space efficiency.
Instead, Wormhole's index space is comparable to those of B+ tree and skip
list. Experiment results show that Wormhole outperforms skip list, B+ tree,
ART, and Masstree by up to 8.4x, 4.9x, 4.3x, and 6.6x in terms of key lookup

evidences that liquid water was abundant at the surface. Among them, one of the
best evidence is that the ancient terrains of Mars are covered with fluvial and
lacustrine features such as valley networks, longitudinal valleys and basin
lakes. In addition, spectroscopic data have shown the widespread presence of
aqueous alteration minerals on the Martian surface, including clays composed by
phyllosilicates and hydrated salts. The main subject of my PhD is the study of
these specific features (such as valley networks and paleolakes) on Mars
surface, both from the geological and spectroscopic point of view through
mapping, sediment transport modelling and CRISM spectra analyses. There are, in
fact, no doubts that these structures were carved by liquid water, but several
questions remain about the mechanisms of their formation and the climatic
conditions under which this formation occurred. In this context, the study of
these structures along with the identification of hydrated minerals, are a key
in the investigation of the past climatic conditions of the planet which can
have, in turn, important astrobiological implications. I updated previous
global maps of Martian valleys using a new photomosaic of the Martian surface
and data at higher resolution with respect to those used in the previous works.
Furthermore, I selected a subset of the mapped valleys which includes 63 large
fluvial systems and evaluated their formation timescales on the basis of
sediment transport modelling. In addition, analyses of CRISM spectral data were
performed on a sample of open/closed basin lakes (associated with the mapped
valleys) detecting the possible presence of hydrated minerals, in particular
(Fe/Mg-smectite), sometimes in association with mafic materials (olivine).

double directional (DD) channel model for downlink channel estimation. This
combination strikes a good balance between high-capacity communications and
parsimonious channel modeling, and also brings limited feedback schemes for
downlink channel state information within reach---since such channel can be
fully characterized by several key parameters. However, most existing channel
estimation work under the DD model has not yet considered DP arrays, perhaps
because of the complex array manifold and the resulting difficulty in algorithm
design. In this paper, we first reveal that the DD channel with DP arrays at
the transmitter and receiver can be naturally modeled as a low-rank tensor, and
thus the key parameters of the channel can be effectively estimated via tensor
decomposition algorithms.
  On the theory side, we show that the DD-DP parameters are identifiable under
very mild conditions, by leveraging identifiability of low-rank tensors.
Furthermore, a compressed tensor decomposition algorithm is developed for
alleviating the downlink training overhead. We show that, by using judiciously
designed pilot structure, the channel parameters are still guaranteed to be
identified via the compressed tensor decomposition formulation even when the
size of the pilot sequence is much smaller than what is needed for conventional
channel identification methods, such as linear least squares and matched
filtering.
  Numerical simulations are presented to showcase the effectiveness of the
proposed methods.

vary between consensus and fragmentation. At the macroscopic population level,
analysis has been limited due to the lack of an analytically tractable
governing macro-equation for the continuous population state. We use the
integro-differential equation that governs opinion dynamics for the continuous
probability distribution function of agent opinions to develop a novel
nonlinear partial differential equation for the evolution of opinion
distributions. The highly nonlinear equation allows for the generation of a
system of approximations. We consider three initial population distributions
and determine their small-time behavior. Our analysis reveals how the
generation of clusters results from the interplay of diffusion and
anti-diffusion and how initial instabilities arise in different regions of the
population distribution.

we study the growth of dark matter perturbations in the both linear and

factor $f(\phi)=f_0\, \phi^{-4}$ with constant $f_0>0$ and assume the DBI dark
energy to be clustered and its sound speed $c_s$ to be constant. For a
spatially flat FRW universe filled with pressureless dark matter and DBI dark
energy, we first obtain the evolutionary behaviors of the background
quantities. Our results show that in our DBI model, the universe starts from a
matter dominated epoch and approaches to the de Sitter universe at late times,
as expected. Also the DBI potential behaves like the power law one
$V(\phi)\propto \phi^n$.
  In addition, we use the Pseudo-Newtonian formalism to obtain the growth
factor of dark matter perturbations in the linear regime. We conclude that for
smaller $c_s$ (or $f_0$), the growth factor of dark matter is smaller for
clustering DBI model compared to the homogeneous one. In the following, in the
non-linear regime based on the spherical collapse model, we obtain the linear
overdensity $\delta_c(z_c)$, the virial overdensity $\Delta_{\rm vir}(z_c)$,
overdensity at the turn around $\zeta(z_c)$ and the rate of expansion of
collapsed region $h_{\rm ta}(z)$. We point out that for the smaller $c_s$ (or
$\tilde{f}_0$), the values of $\delta_c(z_c)$, $\Delta_{\rm vir}(z_c)$,
$\zeta(z_c)$ and $h_{\rm ta}(z)$ in non-clustering DBI models deviate more than
the $\Lambda$CDM compared to the clustering DBI. Finally, with the help of
spherical collapse parameters we calculated the relative number density of halo
objects above a given mass and conclude that the differences between clustering

lipid-DNA complexes. Here we report an observation of a dynamical sliding phase
superfluid that emerges in a nonequilibrium setting from the quantum dynamics
of a three-dimensional ultracold atomic gas loaded into the P-band of a
one-dimensional optical lattice. A shortcut loading method is used to transfer
atoms into the P-band at zero quasimomentum within a very short time duration.
The system can be viewed as a series of ""pancake""-shaped atomic samples. For
this far-out-of-equilibrium system, we find an intermediate time window with a
lifetime around tens of milliseconds, where the atomic ensemble exhibits robust
superfluid phase coherence in the pancake directions, but no coherence in the
lattice direction, which implies a dynamical sliding phase superfluid. The
emergence of the sliding phase is attributed to a mechanism of
cross-dimensional energy transfer in our proposed phenomenological theory,
which is consistent with experimental measurements. This experiment potentially
opens up a novel venue to search for exotic dynamical phases by creating
high-band excitations in optical lattices.

that a displacement component spontaneously cycles around a null value, thus
