and $N$ is an exponential solvable Lie group which is normal in $G.$ Suppose
furthermore that $N$ admits a unitary character $\chi_{\lambda}$ corresponding
to a linear functional $\lambda$ of its Lie algebra. We assume that the map
$h\mapsto Ad\left( h^{-1}\right) ^{\ast}\lambda$ defines an immersion at the
identity of $H$. Fixing a Haar measure on $H,$ we consider the unitary
representation $\pi$ of $G$ obtained by inducing $\chi_{\lambda}.$ This
representation which is realized as acting in $L^{2}\left( H,d\mu_{H}\right) $
is generally not irreducible, and we do not assume that it satisfies any
integrability condition. One of our main results establishes the existence of a
countable set $\Gamma\subset G$ and a function $\mathbf{f}\in L^{2}\left(
H,d\mu_{H}\right) $ which is compactly supported and bounded such that $\left\{
\pi\left( \gamma\right) \mathbf{f}:\gamma\in\Gamma\right\} $ is a frame.
Additionally, we prove that $\mathbf{f}$ can be constructed to be continuous.
In fact, $\mathbf{f}$ can be taken to be as smooth as desired. Our findings
extend the work started in \cite{oussa2018frames} to the more general case
where $H$ is any connected Lie group. We also solve a problem left open in
\cite{oussa2018frames}. Precisely, we prove that in the case where $H$ is an
exponential solvable group, there exist a continuous (or smooth) function
$\mathbf{f}$ and a countable set $\Gamma$ such that $\left\{ \pi\left(
\gamma\right) \mathbf{f}:\gamma\in\Gamma\right\} $ is a Parseval frame. Since
the concept of well-localized frames is central to time-frequency analysis,
wavelet, shearlet and generalized shearlet theories, our results are relevant
to these topics and our approach leads to new constructions which bear
potential for applications.

set of objects (for us, words forming a sentence) in terms of representations
of pairs of objects. We propose two extensions to the basic RN model for
natural language. First, building on the intuition that not all word pairs are
equally informative about the meaning of a sentence, we use constraints based
on both supervised and unsupervised dependency syntax to control which
relations influence the representation. Second, since higher-order relations
are poorly captured by a sum of pairwise relations, we use a recurrent
extension of RNs to propagate information so as to form representations of
higher order relations. Experiments on sentence classification, sentence pair
classification, and machine translation reveal that, while basic RNs are only
modestly effective for sentence representation, recurrent RNs with latent
syntax are a reliably powerful representational device.

allosteric material is evolved in silico to perform a mechanical task. We find
in our model the four types of epistasis (Synergistic, Sign, Antagonistic,
Saturation), which can be both short or long-range and have a simple mechanical
interpretation. We perform a Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) and find that DCA
predicts well the cost of point mutations but is a rather poor generative
model. Strikingly, it can predict short-range epistasis but fails to capture
long-range epistasis, in consistence with empirical findings. We propose that
such failure is generic when function requires subparts to work in concert. We
illustrate this idea with a simple model, which suggests that other methods may
be better suited to capture long-range effects.

5d-5s states at the bottom of the valence band are shifted by 0.75 eV towards
higher binding energy in Beta-Ta compared to alfa-Ta. This is a consequence of
the lower number of nearest neighbors with four in Beta-Ta compared to eight in
the alfa-Ta phase. The difference in the electronic structures, spectral line
shapes of the valence band and the energy positions of the Ta 4f, 5p
core-levels of Beta-Ta versus alfa-Ta are discussed in relation to calculated

Fermi level of Beta-Ta (0.557 states/eV/atom) versus alfa-Ta (1.032

by two transfer functions: the first-order Sears function and the second-order
Atassi function, albeit leading to different results under certain conditions.
Previous studies have shown that the Sears function holds in experiments, but
recently Cordes et al. (2017) reported experimental data that corresponded to
the Atassi function rather than the Sears function. In order to clarify the
observed discrepancy, the specific differences between these models are
isolated analytically in this study and are related to physical gust
parameters. Gusts with these parameters are then produced in wind-tunnel
experiments using an active-grid gust generator. Measurements of the unsteady
gust loads on an airfoil in the wind tunnel at Reynolds numbers ($Re_c$) of
$2.0\times 10^5$ and $2.6\times 10^5$ and reduced frequencies between 0.09 and
0.42 confirm that the decisive difference between the Sears and Atassi
functions lies in the character of the gust and not in the characteristics of
the airfoil. The differences in the gust-response data between Sears and Atassi
gust conditions are shown to be significant only at low reduced frequencies.
These findings are supported by numerical simulations of the experimental
setup. Finally, the influence of boundary-layer turbulence on experimental
convergence with model predictions is investigated. These results serve to
clarify the conditions under which the Sears and Atassi functions can be
applied, and they establish the validity of both in an experimental context.

better or worse to an experimental treatment. Identifying predictive
covariates, which influence the treatment effect and can be used to define
subgroups of patients, is a key aspect of this task. Analyses of treatment
effect heterogeneity are however known to be challenging, since the number of
possible covariates or subgroups is often large, while samples sizes in earlier
phases of drug development are often small. In addition, distinguishing
predictive covariates from prognostic covariates, which influence the response
independent of the given treatment, can often be difficult. While many
approaches for these types of problems have been proposed, most of them focus
on the two-arm clinical trial setting, where patients are given either the
treatment or a control. In this paper we consider parallel groups dose-finding
trials, in which patients are administered different doses of the same
treatment. To investigate treatment effect heterogeneity in this setting we
propose a Bayesian hierarchical dose-response model with covariate effects on
dose-response parameters. We make use of shrinkage priors to prevent
overfitting, which can easily occur, when the number of considered covariates
is large and sample sizes are small. We compare several such priors in
simulations and also investigate dependent modeling of prognostic and
predictive effects to better distinguish these two types of effects. We
illustrate the use of our proposed approach using a Phase II dose-finding trial
and show how it can be used to identify predictive covariates and subgroups of
patients with increased treatment effects.

polarization applicable to quantum dots and other interacting spin systems. The
exact steady state of the optically driven coupled electron-nuclear system is
calculated under the assumption of uniform hyperfine coupling strengths (box
model) for an arbitrary number of nuclear spins. This steady state is given by
a tractable expression that allows for an intuitive interpretation in terms of
spin-flip rates. Based on this result, we investigate the nuclear spin
behaviour for different experimental parameter regimes and find that our model
reproduces the flat-top and triangular absorption line shapes seen in various
experiments (line dragging) under the assumption of fast electron spin
dephasing due to phonons and co-tunneling. The mechanism responsible for line
dragging has been a matter of controversy so far; in contrast with previous
works, we show that the effect can be explained solely in terms of the contact
hyperfine interaction, without the need to introduce non-collinear terms or
other types of electron-nuclear interactions. Furthermore we predict a novel
nuclear spin polarization effect: under particular, experimentally realistic
conditions, the nuclear spin system tends to become sharply polarized in such a
way as to cancel the effect of the external magnetic field. This effect can
therefore suppress electron spin dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening,
which could have important repercussions for quantum technological
applications.

  Existing works on gait recognition are far from enough to provide satisfying
performances because of such view changes. Furthermore, very few works have

today's AC power grids, necessitating optimal power flow (OPF) tools for the
analysis, planning, and operation of such hybrid systems. To this end, we
introduce hynet, a Python-based open-source OPF framework for hybrid AC/DC
grids with point-to-point and radial multi-terminal HVDC systems. hynet's
design promotes ease of use and extensibility, which is supported by the
particular mathematical model and software design presented in this paper. The
system model features a unified representation of AC and DC subgrids as well as
a concise and flexible converter model, which enable the compact description of
a hybrid AC/DC power system and its OPF problem. To support convex relaxation
based OPF solution techniques, a state space relaxation is introduced to obtain
a unified OPF formulation that is analogous to the OPF of AC power systems.
This enables the direct generalization of relaxation-related results for AC
grids to hybrid AC/DC grids, which is shown for the semidefinite and
second-order cone relaxation as well as associated results on exactness and
locational marginal prices. Finally, hynet's object-oriented software design is
discussed, which provides extensibility via inheritance and standard design
patterns, and its robust and competitive performance is illustrated with case
studies.

phases, which are invisible to conventional diffraction techniques. The
multipolar moments of the $f$-electrons in their specific crystal field
environment play a decisive role in the formation of these phases. Such
hidden-order phases have been observed in a variety of compounds containing
$4f$ and $5f$ elements, like URu$_2$Si$_2$, NpO$_2$, YbRu$_2$Ge$_2$, and
CeB$_6$. The competition or coexistence of multipolar ordering with more
conventional magnetic order parameters, such as ferro- or antiferromagnetism,
gives rise to complex magnetic-field$-$temperature phase diagrams in these
compounds that provide a rich playground for experimental and theoretical
investigations. Here I examine the pure and La-doped $f$-electron system
CeB$_6$, as well as Ce$_{3}$Pd$_{20}$Si$_{6}$, by means of neutron scattering.
The magnetic field dependence of the zone center exciton mode in CeB$_6$ was
studied in fields up to 14.5 T and compared with the existing theory. A long
standing question of the applicability of the phenomenological temperature
dependence $\Gamma=k_{\text B}T_{\text K}+A \sqrt{T}$, where $T_{\text K}$ is

constructs a basis of modes of the field associated to each Cauchy
hypersurface, by means of an eigenvalue problem posed in the hypersurface. The
Bogoliubov transformation between bases associated to different times can be
computed through a differential equation, which coefficients have simple
expressions in terms of the solutions to the eigenvalue problem. This
transformation can be interpreted physically when it connects two regions of
the spacetime where the metric is static. Conceptually, the method is a
generalisation of Parker's early work on cosmological particle creation. It
proves especially useful in the regime of small perturbations, where it allows
one to easily make quantitative predictions on the amplitude of the resonances
of the field, providing an important tool in the growing research area of
confined quantum fields in table-top experiments. We give examples within the
perturbative regime (gravitational waves) and the non-perturbative regime

the method, dedicated to spacetimes without boundaries or which boundaries

collection of images. Previous work achieved this capability by exploiting
additional manual annotation, such as object pose, 3D surface templates,
temporal continuity of videos, manually selected landmarks, and
foreground/background masks. In contrast, our method does not make use of any
such annotation. Rather, it builds a generative model, a convolutional neural
network, which, given a noise vector sample, outputs the 3D surface and texture
of an object and a background image. These 3 components combined with an
additional random viewpoint vector are then fed to a differential renderer to
produce a view of the sampled object and background. Our general principle is
that if the output of the renderer, the generated image, is realistic, then its
input, the generated 3D and texture, should also be realistic. To achieve
realism, the generative model is trained adversarially against a discriminator
that tries to distinguish between the output of the renderer and real images
from the given data set. Moreover, our generative model can be paired with an
encoder and trained as an autoencoder, to automatically extract the 3D shape,
texture and pose of the object in an image. Our trained generative model and
encoder show promising results both on real and synthetic data, which
demonstrate for the first time that fully unsupervised 3D learning from image
collections is possible.

they have a large number of parameters. But the models themselves actually
depend on (i.e. are sensitive to) only a subset of those parameters. Rigorously
identifying this subset of ""stiff"" parameters has been made possible by the
development of parameter space compression (PSC). However, PSC has only been
applied to analytically-solvable physical models. We have generalized this
powerful method by developing a numerical approach to PSC that can be applied
to any computational model. We validated our method against
analytically-solvable models of random walk with drift and protein production
and degradation. We then applied our method to an active area of biophysics
research, namely to a simple computational model of microtubule dynamic
instability. Such models have become increasingly complex, perhaps
unnecessarily. By adding two new parameters that account for prominent
structural features of microtubules, we identify one that can be ""compressed
away"" (the ""seam"" in the microtubule) and another that is essential to model
performance (the ""tapering"" of microtubule ends). Furthermore, we show that the
microtubule model has an underlying, low-dimensional structure that explains
the vast majority of our experimental data. We argue that numerical PSC can
identify the low-dimensional structure of any computational model in
biophysics. The low-dimensional structure of a model is easier to interpret and
identifies the mechanisms and experiments that best characterize the system.

off-the-shelf pre-trained CNNs to perform scene classification given only
contour information as input and find performance levels well above chance. We
also show that medial-axis based contour salience methods can be used to select
more informative subsets of contour pixels and that the variation in CNN
classification performance on various choices for these subsets is
qualitatively similar to that observed in human performance. Moreover, when the
salience measures are used to weight the contours, as opposed to pruning them,
we find that these weights boost our CNN performance above that for unweighted

terms of infinite dimensional block diagonal Lie algebras while the other part
breaks this symmetry to achieve controllability. An induction on the number of
cavities extends this result to the general case. Individual control of the
qubit and collective control of the hopping between cavities is sufficient for
both pure state and strong operator controllability. We additionally establish
new criteria for the controllability of infinite dimensional quantum systems

(called ""named entities"": names, places, locations, ...) when they appear in
natural language. The second subproblem, named entity linking/identification
(NEL), considers these entity mentions as queries to be identified in a
pre-existing database. In this paper, we consider the NEL problem, and assume a
set of queries (or mentions) that have to be identified within a knowledge
base. This knowledge base is represented by a text database paired with a
semantic graph. We present state-of-the-art methods in NEL, and propose a
2-step method for individual identification of named entities. Our approach is
well-motivated by the limitations brought by recent deep learning approaches
that lack interpratability, and require lots of parameter tuning along with
large volume of annotated data.
  First of all, we propose a filtering algorithm designed with information
retrieval and text mining techniques, aiming to maximize precision at K
(typically for 5 <= K <=20). Then, we introduce two graph-based methods for
named entity identification to maximize precision at 1 by re-ranking the
remaining top entity candidates. The first identification method is using
parametrized graph mining, and the second similarity with graph kernels. Our
approach capitalizes on a fine-grained classification of entities from
annotated web data. We present our algorithms in details, and show
experimentally on standard datasets (NIST TAC-KBP, CONLL/AIDA) their
performance in terms of precision are better than any graph-based method
reported, and competitive with state-of-the-art systems. Finally, we conclude
on the advantages of our graph-based approach compared to recent deep learning
methods.

propose a similarity preserving generative adversarial network (SPGAN) and its

SPGAN enforces this property by heuristic constraints, while eSPGAN does so by
optimally facilitating the re-ID model learning. More specifically, SPGAN
separately undertakes the two components in the ""learning via translation""
framework. It first preserves two types of unsupervised similarity, namely,
self-similarity of an image before and after translation, and
domain-dissimilarity of a translated source image and a target image. It then
learns a re-ID model using existing networks. In comparison, eSPGAN seamlessly
integrates image translation and re-ID model learning. During the end-to-end
training of eSPGAN, re-ID learning guides image translation to preserve the
underlying identity information of an image. Meanwhile, image translation
improves re-ID learning by providing identity-preserving training samples of
the target domain style. In the experiment, we show that identities of the fake

For the most distant $\gamma$-ray NLSy1, PKS J1222$+$0413, Intra-Night Optical
Variability (INOV) characterisation is presented for the first time. The
blazar-like behaviour of the nearest $\gamma$-ray NLSy1 1H 0323$+$342, which
showed strong INOV on 4 of the 5 nights, was unexpected in view of its recent
reclassification as `radio intermediate' (R$_{5 GHz}$ $\lesssim$ 25). Its
particularly violent INOV is manifested by two optical outbursts lasting $\sim$
1 hour, whose rapid brightening phase is shown to imply a doubling time of
$\sim$ 1 hour for the optical synchrotron flux, after (conservatively)
deducting the thermal optical emission contributed by the host galaxy and the
Seyfert nucleus. A more realistic `decontamination' could well reduce
substantially the flux doubling time, bringing it still closer in rapidity to
the ultra-fast VHE ($>$ 100 GeV) flares reported for the blazars PKS 1222$+$216
and PKS 2155$-$304. A large contamination by thermal optical emission may, in
fact, be common for NLSy1s as they are high Eddington rate accretors. The
present study further suggests that superluminal motion in the radio jet could
be a robust diagnostic of INOV.

higher-order squeezing (both Hong Mandel type and Hillery type). A set of other

present in essential and parkinsonian tremor. Other applications, such as the
beating of the heart and insulin secretion, require synchronization, and
recently there has been interest in forming clusters within an oscillator
population as well. In this article, we use a formulation that allows us to
devise control frameworks to achieve all of these distinct collective behaviors
observed in biological oscillators. This is based on the Fourier decomposition
of the partial differential equation governing the evolution of the phase
distribution of a population of identical, uncoupled oscillators. Our first two
control algorithms are Lyapunov-based, which work by decreasing a positive
definite Lyapunov function towards zero. Our third control is an optimal
control algorithm, which minimizes the control energy consumption while
achieving the desired collective behavior of an oscillator population.
Motivated by pathological neural synchrony, we apply our control to
desynchronize an initially synchronized neural population. Given the proposed
importance of enhancing spike time dependent plasticity to stabilize neural
clusters and counteract pathological neural synchronization, we formulate the
phase difference distribution in terms of the phase distribution, and prove
some of its fundamental properties, and in turn apply our control to transform
the neural phase distribution to form clusters. Finally, motivated by
eliminating cardiac alternans, we apply our control to phase shift a
synchronous cardiac pacemaker cell population.

represented in the physical world. Its special nature make them a fascinating
tool to test and validate any new vision model proposed. In general, current
vision models are based on the concatenation of linear convolutions and
non-linear operations. In this paper we get inspiration from the similarity of
this structure with the operations present in Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs). This motivated us to study if CNNs trained for low-level visual tasks
are deceived by visual illusions. In particular, we show that CNNs trained for
image denoising, image deblurring, and computational color constancy are able
to replicate the human response to visual illusions, and that the extent of
this replication varies with respect to variation in architecture and spatial
pattern size. We believe that this CNNs behaviour appears as a by-product of
the training for the low level vision tasks of denoising, color constancy or
deblurring. Our work opens a new bridge between human perception and CNNs: in
order to obtain CNNs that better replicate human behaviour, we may need to
start aiming for them to better replicate visual illusions.

workloads of real-world distributed storage systems. The SNOW Theorem stated
that ideal READ transactions that have optimal latency and the strongest
guarantees, i.e. ""SNOW"" READ transactions, are impossible in one specific
setting that requires three or more clients: at least two readers and one
writer. However, it left many open questions. We close all of these open
questions with new impossibility results and new algorithms. First, we prove
rigorously the result from the The SNOW Theorem paper saying that it is
impossible to have a READ transactions system that satisfies SNOW properties
with three or more clients. The insight we gained from this proof led to
teasing out the implicit assumptions that are required to state the results and
also, resolving the open question regarding the possibility of SNOW with two
clients. We show that it is possible to design an algorithm, where SNOW is
possible in a multi-writer, single-reader (MWSR) setting when a client can send
messages to other clients; on the other hand, we prove it is impossible to
implement SNOW in a multi-writer, single-reader (MWSR) setting, which is more
general than the two-client setting, when client-to-client communication is
disallowed. We also correct the previous claim in The SNOW Theorem paper that
incorrectly identified one existing system, Eiger, as supporting the strongest
guarantees (SW) and whose read-only transactions had bounded latency. Thus,
there were no previous algorithms that provided the strongest guarantees and
had bounded latency. Finally, we introduce the first two algorithms to provide
the strongest guarantees with bounded latency.

changes of the input. Even in a simple setting, e.g., when the costs come from
the metric on the line, adding two nodes to the input might change the optimal
solution completely. On the other hand, one expects that small changes in the
input should incur only small changes on the constructed solutions, measured as
the number of modified edges. We introduce a two-stage model where we study the
trade-off between quality and robustness of solutions. In the first stage we
are given a set of nodes in a metric space and we must compute a perfect
matching. In the second stage $2k$ new nodes appear and we must adapt the
solution to a perfect matching for the new instance.
  We say that an algorithm is $(\alpha,\beta)$-robust if the solutions
constructed in both stages are $\alpha$-approximate with respect to min-cost
perfect matchings, and if the number of edges deleted from the first stage
matching is at most $\beta k$. Hence, $\alpha$ measures the quality of the
algorithm and $\beta$ its robustness. In this setting we aim to balance both
measures by deriving algorithms for constant $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We show that
there exists an algorithm that is $(3,1)$-robust for any metric if one knows

the situation is significantly more involved. We study this setting under the

estimate expectations of functions of {\em all the variables} of the model.
Under the same condition, we show that the synchronous (sequential) and
asynchronous Gibbs samplers can be coupled so that the expected Hamming
distance between their (multivariate) samples remains bounded by $O(\tau \log
n),$ where $n$ is the number of variables in the graphical model, and $\tau$ is
a measure of the asynchronicity. A similar bound holds for any constant power
of the Hamming distance. Hence, the expectation of any function that is
Lipschitz with respect to a power of the Hamming distance, can be estimated
with a bias that grows logarithmically in $n$. Going beyond Lipschitz
functions, we consider the bias arising from asynchronicity in estimating the
expectation of polynomial functions of all variables in the model. Using recent
concentration of measure results, we show that the bias introduced by the
asynchronicity is of smaller order than the standard deviation of the function

a Lindblad master equation with multimode nonlinear Lindblad operators

users' SE. From the free-space path-loss channel model, a data-rate gradient is
calculated and used to direct the UAVs in a long-term perspective towards the
local optimal solution on the two-dimensional spatial grid. Therefore, a
control system implementation is designed. Thereby, the UAVs follow the

with a gradient method. The system can react to changes of the user locations
online; this system design captures the interaction between multiple UAV

apparently not fully following the logic in our paper. Thus, as an example,
while criticizing our parallel curves, they claim in several places that it is
not possible to construct any parallel curves with an arbitrary angle between

of the centre of the giant elliptical galaxy M86 (NGC 4406) in the Virgo
Cluster. The spectrum of M86 tULX-1 can be fit by a power-law plus
multicolour-disc model with a 1.0 [+0.8 -2.6] index and an 0.66 [+0.17 -0.11]

an isotropically emitting source at the distance of M86, the luminosity based
on the superposition of spectral models is (5 +/- 1) x 10^39 erg/s. Its
relatively hard spectrum places M86 tULX-1 in a hitherto unpopulated region in
the luminosity-disc temperature diagram, between other ULXs and the
(sub-Eddington) black-hole X-ray binaries. We discovered M86 tULX-1 in an
archival 148-ks 2013 July Chandra observation, and it was not detected in a
20-ks 2016 May Chandra observation, meaning it faded by a factor of at least 30
in three years. Based on our analysis of deep optical imaging of M86, it is
probably not located in a globular cluster. It is the brightest ULX found in an
old field environment unaffected by recent galaxy interaction. We conclude that
M86 tULX-1 may be a stellar-mass black hole of ~30 - 100 M_Sun with a low-mass
giant companion, or a transitional object in a state between the normal
stellar-mass black holes and the ultraluminous state.

enable us to develop new insights and better models.
  In this work, we present an analytic framework to visualize and understand

interpretable units that are closely related to object concepts using a
segmentation-based network dissection method. Then, we quantify the causal
effect of interpretable units by measuring the ability of interventions to
control objects in the output. We examine the contextual relationship between
these units and their surroundings by inserting the discovered object concepts
into new images. We show several practical applications enabled by our
framework, from comparing internal representations across different layers,
models, and datasets, to improving GANs by locating and removing
artifact-causing units, to interactively manipulating objects in a scene. We
provide open source interpretation tools to help researchers and practitioners

that the entanglement of the emitters has on the correlations in the signal and

entanglement of the emitters, the flow of information in the shockwave can be
modulated and spatially shaped to some extent independently of the flow of

coupling between the receiver and the quantum field which optimizes the channel

while field UDGs arise from dwarfs in a characteristic mass range by multiple
episodes of supernova feedback (Di Cintio et al. 2017), group UDGs may also
form by tidal puffing up and they become quiescent by ram-pressure stripping.
The field and group UDGs share similar properties, independent of distance from
the group centre. Their dark-matter haloes have ordinary spin parameters and
centrally dominant dark-matter cores. Their stellar components tend to have a
prolate shape with a Sersic index n~1 but no significant rotation. Ram pressure
removes the gas from the group UDGs when they are at pericentre, quenching star
formation in them and making them redder. This generates a
colour/star-formation-rate gradient with distance from the centre, as observed
in clusters. We find that ~20 per cent of the field UDGs that fall into a
massive halo survive as satellite UDGs. In addition, normal field dwarfs on
highly eccentric orbits can become UDGs near pericentre due to tidal puffing
up, contributing about half of the group-UDG population. We interpret our
findings using simple toy models, showing that gas stripping is mostly due to
ram pressure rather than tides. We estimate that the energy deposited by tides
in the bound component of a satellite over one orbit can cause significant
puffing up provided that the orbit is sufficiently eccentric.

the form of a topological $BF$ theory coupled to NG bosons, and fractional

redshift during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) through line-intensity mapping.
A number of ongoing and planned surveys are using the 21 cm line to trace
neutral hydrogen fluctuations in the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the EoR.
These may be fruitfully combined with separate efforts to measure large-scale
emission fluctuations from galactic lines such as [CII], CO, H-$\alpha$, and
Ly-$\alpha$ during the same epoch. The large scale power spectrum of each line
encodes important information about reionization, with the 21 cm power spectrum
providing a relatively direct tracer of the ionization history. Here we show
that the large scale 21 cm power spectrum can be extracted using only
cross-power spectra between the 21 cm fluctuations and each of two separate
line-intensity mapping data cubes. This technique is more robust to residual
foregrounds than the usual 21 cm auto-power spectrum measurements and so can
help in verifying auto-spectrum detections. We characterize the accuracy of
this method using numerical simulations and find that the large-scale 21 cm
power spectrum can be inferred to an accuracy of within 5% for most of the EoR,
reaching 0.6% accuracy on a scale of $k\sim0.1\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ at $\left< x_i

clues about the assembly histories of galaxies. To date, studies of these

morphological classification which leaves their interpretation significantly
uncertain. In this work we present a new machine-vision technique based on the
Subspace-Constrained Mean Shift (SCMS) algorithm which can perform these tasks
automatically. SCMS finds the location of the high-density `ridges' that define
substructure morphology. After identification, the coefficients of an
orthogonal series density estimator are used to classify points on the ridges
as part of a continuum between shell-like or stream-like debris, from which a
global morphological classification can be determined. We dub this procedure
Subspace Constrained Unsupervised Detection of Structure (SCUDS). By applying
this tool to controlled N--body simulations of minor mergers we demonstrate
that the extracted classifications correspond to the well--understood
underlying physics of phase mixing. The application of SCUDS to resolved
stellar population data from near-future surveys will inform our understanding
of the buildup of galaxies stellar halos.

multiple images of FRBs could be more numerous than those of gamma ray bursts

between the multiple images of an FRB break degeneracies in model-based and
model-independent lens reconstructions as other time-varying sources do, yet
without a microlensing bias as FRBs are more point-like and have shorter

galaxy-cluster scale lenses, yielding more precise (local) lens properties than
time delays from the other time-varying sources. Using the lens modelling

the presence of rotating shadows in the disk, caused by mutual occultations of
the central binary. Shadow-like features are often observed in

We calculate a distance that is in very good agreement with the value obtained

NIHAO project to investigate the impact of the threshold for star formation on
the response of the dark matter (DM) halo to baryonic processes. The fiducial
NIHAO threshold, $n=10\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$, results in strong expansion of the DM
halo in galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^{7.5} < M_{star} <
10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$. We find that lower thresholds such as $n=0.1$ (as employed
by the EAGLE/APOSTLE and Illustris/AURIGA projects) do not result in
significant halo expansion at any mass scale. Halo expansion driven by
supernova feedback requires significant fluctuations in the local gas fraction
on sub-dynamical times (i.e., < 50 Myr at galaxy half-light radii), which are
themselves caused by variability in the star formation rate. At one per cent of
the virial radius, simulations with $n=10$ have gas fractions of $\simeq 0.2$
and variations of $\simeq 0.1$, while $n=0.1$ simulations have order of
magnitude lower gas fractions and hence do not expand the halo. The observed DM
circular velocities of nearby dwarf galaxies are inconsistent with CDM
simulations with $n=0.1$ and $n=1$, but in reasonable agreement with $n=10$.
Star formation rates are more variable for higher $n$, lower galaxy masses, and
when star formation is measured on shorter time scales. For example,
simulations with $n=10$ have up to 0.4 dex higher scatter in specific star
formation rates than simulations with $n=0.1$. Thus observationally
constraining the sub-grid model for star formation, and hence the nature of DM,
should be possible in the near future.

found to exhibit some chemical peculiarities with respect to the red giant
branch (RGB) stars. A discrepancy between [FeI/H] and [FeII/H] (not observed in
RGB stars) has been detected adopting spectroscopic temperatures. Moreover, a
possible lack of second-population stars along the AGB was claimed. The use of
photometric temperatures based on (V-K) colors was proposed to erase this iron
discrepancy. Also, ad hoc scenarios have been proposed to explain the absence
of second-population AGB stars. Here we analyzed a sample of 19 AGB and 14 RGB
stars of NGC6752 observed with the spectrographs UVES. The two temperature
scales agree very well for the RGB stars while for the AGB stars there is a
systematic offset of ~100 K. We found that even if the photometric temperatures
alleviate the iron discrepancy with respect to the spectroscopic ones, a
systematic difference between [FeI/H] and [FeII/H] is still found among the AGB
stars. An unexpected result is that the photometric temperatures do not satisfy
the excitation equilibrium in the AGB stars. This suggests that standard 1D-LTE
model atmospheres are unable to properly describe the thermal structure of AGB
stars, at variance with the RGB stars. The use of photometric temperatures
confirms the previous detection of second-population AGB stars in this cluster,
with the presence of clear correlations/anticorrelations among the light

galactic nuclei contain large numbers of stars, black holes (BHs) and neutron
stars (NSs), a fraction of which are likely to form binaries. These binaries
were suggested to form a triple system with the SMBH, which acts as a perturber
and may enhance BH and NS mergers via the Lidov-Kozai mechanism. We follow-up
previous studies, but for the first time perform an extensive statistical study
of BH-BH, NS-NS and BH-NS binary mergers by means of direct high-precision
regularized $N$-body simulations, including Post-Newtonian (PN) terms up to
order PN2.5. We consider different SMBH masses, slopes for the BH mass
function, binary semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions, and different
spatial distributions for the binaries. We find that the merger rates are a
decreasing function of the SMBH mass and are in the ranges $\sim 0.17$-$0.52 \
\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, $\sim 0.06$-$0.10 \ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\
\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and $\sim 0.04$-$0.16 \ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$
for BH-BH, BH-NS and NS-NS binaries, respectively. However, the rate estimate
from this channel remains highly uncertain and depends on the specific
assumptions regarding the star-formation history in galactic nuclei and the
supply rate of compact objects. We find that $\sim 10\%$--$20\%$ of the mergers
enter the LIGO band with eccentricities $\gtrsim 0.1$. We also compare our
results to the secular approximation, and show that $N$-body simulations
generally predict a larger number of mergers. Finally, these events can also be
observable via their electromagnetic counterparts, thus making these compact
object mergers especially valuable for cosmological and astrophysical purposes.

The BHBs have masses in the range of the first LIGO/Virgo detections. Some of
our models show a significant hardening of the BHB in a relatively short time.
Some of them merge within the cluster, while ejected binaries, typically, have
exceedingly long merger timescales. The perturbation of stars around BHB
systems is key to induce their coalescence. The BHBs which merge in the cluster
could be detected with a delay of a few years between space detectors, as
future LISA, and ground-based ones, due to their relatively high eccentricity.
Under our assumptions, we estimate a BHB merger rate of $R_{\rm mrg} \sim 2$
yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$. We see that in many cases the BHB triggers tidal
disruption events which, however, are not linked to the GW emission. Open
cluster-like systems are, hence, a promising environment for GWs from BHBs and

sub-dwarf scales. While the primordial cutoff delays the formation of the first

to CDM. We show that although DAOs are quickly washed away in the non-linear

implications for particle physics and cosmology. Fifth force bounds impose
stringent constraints on the interactions of such moduli with the visible
sector. To be consistent with the bounds, they need to be part of hidden
sectors which interact with the Standard Model with weaker-than-Planck
suppressed interactions. We consider scenarios in which the visible sector
degrees of freedom are localised in the compactification and light moduli arise
as closed string degrees of freedom associated with hidden sectors which are
geometrically separated (in the extra-dimensions) from the Standard Model.
Kinetic mixings lead to interactions between the moduli and the visible sector
- we compute these using Kaehler potentials of string/M-theory
compactifications. We argue that in general these interactions provide a lower
bound on the strength of the interactions between the moduli and the visible
sector. The interactions scale with inverse powers of the volume of the
compactification, thus fifth force bounds can be translated to lower bounds on
the volume of the extra-dimensions. We find that compactification volumes have
to be large to evade the bounds. This imposes interesting constraints on
quintessence model building in string theory. Our results for the strength of
the interactions can also be used to quantify the fine-tuning necessary for the
stability of the potential of a light modulus against quantum corrections
involving visible sector loops.

fields turns the chiral magnetic wave into a diffusive mode. While the

emergence of our macroscopic Universe from physics at the Planck scale. In the
group field theory (GFT) approach to quantum gravity, such a macroscopic
universe results from the formation of a ""condensate"" of fundamentally discrete
degrees of freedom. It has been shown that the effective dynamics of such GFT
condensates follows the classical Friedmann dynamics at late times, while
avoiding the classical singularity by a bounce akin to the one of loop quantum
cosmology (LQC). It was also shown how quantum fluctuations in a GFT condensate
provide an initial power spectrum of volume fluctuations around exact
homogeneity. Here we connect the results for quantum fluctuations in GFT to the
usual formalism for cosmological perturbations within quantum field theory in
curved spacetime. We consider a bouncing universe filled with a massless scalar
field, in which perturbations are generated by vacuum fluctuations in the
contracting phase. Matching conditions at the bounce are provided by working
within LQC. We then compare the results to the GFT condensate scenario for
quantum gravity with massless scalar matter. Here, instead, an initial quantum
phase described by a GFT condensate generates initial scalar perturbations
through quantum fluctuations. We show general agreement in the predictions of
both approaches, suggesting that GFT condensates can provide a physical

The advantage of this approach is that any analysis can be done without sample
variance if the same initial conditions are used in simulations and
perturbation theory calculations. We write the bias expansion in terms of
modified bias operators in Eulerian space, designed such that the large bulk
flows are automatically resummed and not treated perturbatively. Using these
operators, the bias model accurately matches the Eulerian density of halos in
N-body simulations. The mean-square model error is close to the Poisson shot
noise for a wide range of halo masses and it is rather scale-independent, with
scale-dependent corrections becoming relevant at the nonlinear scale. In
contrast, for linear bias the mean-square model error can be higher than the
Poisson prediction by factors of up to a few on large scales, and it becomes
scale dependent already in the linear regime. We show that by weighting
simulated halos by their mass, the mean-square error of the model can be
further reduced by up to an order of magnitude, or by a factor of two when
including $60\%$ mass scatter. We also test the Standard Eulerian bias model
using the nonlinear matter field measured from simulations and show that it
leads to a larger and more scale-dependent model error than the bias expansion
based on perturbation theory. These results may be of particular relevance for
cosmological inference methods that use a likelihood of the biased tracer at
the field level, or for initial condition and BAO reconstruction that requires
a precise estimate of the large-scale potential from the biased tracer density.

apply the appropriate cosmological corrections to the spectrum and rate in

responsible for the optimal bounds of the numerical bootstrap. We explain in
detail that the extremal functionals probe the Regge limit. We construct two
complete sets of extremal functionals for the crossing equation specialized to
$z=\bar{z}$, associated to the generalized free boson and fermion theories.
These functionals lead to non-perturbative sum rules on the CFT data which
automatically incorporate Regge boundedness of physical correlators. The sum
rules imply universal properties of the OPE at large $\Delta$ in every unitary
solution of SL(2) crossing. In particular, we prove an upper and lower bound on
a weighted sum of OPE coefficients present between consecutive generalized free
field dimensions. The lower bound implies the $\phi\times\phi$ OPE must contain
at least one primary in the interval $[2\Delta_{\phi}+2n,2\Delta_{\phi}+2n+4]$

OPE decomposition of crossing-symmetrized Witten exchange diagrams in $AdS_2$.

The first aspect
is how to mitigate their side effects for naturally trained deep learning
systems. One of the motivations for looking into this problem is to reduce the
high power cost of conventional computing of neural networks through the use of
analog neuromorphic circuits. Traditional GPU/CPU-centered deep learning
architectures exhibit bottlenecks in power-restricted applications (e.g.,
embedded systems). The use of specialized neuromorphic circuits, where analog
signals passed through memory-cell arrays are sensed to accomplish
matrix-vector multiplications, promises large power savings and speed gains but
brings with it the problems of limited precision of computations and
unavoidable analog noise. We manage to improve inference accuracy from 21.1% to
99.5% for MNIST images, from 29.9% to 89.1% for CIFAR10, and from 15.5% to
89.6% for MNIST stroke sequences with the presence of strong noise (with
signal-to-noise power ratio being 0 dB) by noise-injected training and a voting
method. This observation promises neural networks that are insensitive to
inference noise, which reduces the quality requirements on neuromorphic
circuits and is crucial for their practical usage. The second aspect is how to
utilize the noisy inference as a defensive architecture against black-box
adversarial attacks. During inference, by injecting proper noise to signals in
the neural networks, the robustness of adversarially-trained neural networks
against black-box attacks has been further enhanced by 0.5% and 1.13% for two

persistent challenge for ultrasound due to the imaging degradation effects from

morphology and they have high variability across individuals. Here we
demonstrate the feasibility of human transcranial super-resolution imaging
using a geometrical focusing approach to concentrate energy at the region of
interest, and a phase correction focusing approach that takes the skull
morphology into account. It is shown that using the proposed focused method, we
can image a 208$\mu$m microtube behind a human skull phantom in both an
out-of-plane and an in-plane configuration. Individual phase correction
profiles for the temporal region of the human skull were calculated and applied
to transmit-receive a custom-focused super-resolution imaging sequence through
a human skull phantom, targeting the microtube, at 68.5mm in depth, at 2.5 MHz.
Microbubble contrast agents were diluted to a concentration of
1.6$\times$10$^6$ bubbles/mL and perfused through the microtube. It is shown
that by correcting for the skull aberration, the RF signal amplitude from the
tube improved by a factor of 1.6 in the out-of-plane focused emission case. The
lateral registration error of the tube's position, which in the uncorrected
case was 990 $\mu$m, was reduced to 50$\mu$m in the corrected case as measured
in the B-mode images. Sensitivity in microbubble detection for the phase
corrected case increased by a factor of 1.5 in the out-of-plane imaging case,
while in the in-plane case it improved by a factor of 1.3 while achieving an
axial registration correction from an initial 1885$\mu$m error for the
uncorrected emission, to a 284$\mu$m error for the corrected counterpart. These
findings suggest that super-resolution may be used more generally as a clinical
imaging modality in the brain.

Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling of a grid of photoionization models, we

unimodal or bimodal distribution. The pLLSs and LLSs probe a similar range of
metallicities -3<[X/H]<+0.4, but the fraction of very metal-poor absorbers with
[X/H]<-1.4 is much larger for the pLLSs than the LLSs. In contrast, absorbers

abundant metal-poor CGM gas (41-59% of the pLLSs have [X/H]<-1.4), representing

scenario, the observed baryon asymmetry is produced through spontaneous
baryogenesis---driven by the early evolution of the axion---while its late-time
coherent oscillations explain the observed DM abundance. Typically, spontaneous
baryogenesis via axions is only successful in regions of parameter space where
the axion is relatively heavy, rendering it highly unstable and unfit as a dark
matter candidate. However, we show that a field-dependent wavefunction
renormalization can arise which effectively ""deforms"" the axion potential,
allowing for efficient generation of baryon asymmetry while maintaining a light
and stable axion. Meanwhile, such deformations of the potential induce
non-trivial axion dynamics, including a tracking behavior during its
intermediate phase of evolution. This attractor-like dynamics dramatically
reduces the sensitivity of the axion relic abundance to initial conditions and
naturally suppresses DM isocurvature perturbations. Finally, we construct an
explicit model realization, using a continuum-clockwork axion, and survey the
details of its phenomenological viability.

new devices. Perhaps this is most evident in the push to develop quantum
information and spintronic technologies. On the side of quantum information,
engineered light-matter interactions offer a powerful means to access and
control quantum states, while at the same time new insights into spin-photon
manipulation will benefit the development of spintronic technologies. In this
context the recent discovery of hybridization between ferromagnets and cavity
photons has ushered in a new era of light-matter exploration at the crossroads
of quantum information and spintronics. The key player in this rapidly
developing field of cavity spintronics is a quasiparticle, the
cavity-magnon-polariton. In this early review of recent work, the fundamental
behaviour of the cavity-magnon-polariton is summarized and related to the
development of new spintronic applications. In the last few years a
comprehensive theoretical framework of spin-photon hybridization has been
developed. On an intuitive level many features can be described by a model of
coupled oscillators, however the origin of hybridization is only revealed by
considering a comprehensive electrodynamic framework. Here both approaches are
summarized and a quantum description using the input-output formalism is
outlined. Based on this foundation, in depth experimental investigations of the
coupled spin-photon system have been performed. For example, the influence of
hybridization on spin current generation has been revealed and several in-situ
coupling control mechanisms have been developed. The many recent developments
within this field represent only the first steps in what appears to be a bright
future for cavity spintronics.

acceptance bypasses small gains to identify significantly-improved stepping
stone programs that tend to generalize and enable further progress. The method
performs well on a set of established benchmarks, and succeeds on the
previously unsolved ""Collatz Numbers"" program synthesis problem. Additional

extensively studied, with the purpose of capturing latent semantic relations

typically model the inherent uncertainty of relations facts with a confidence
score, and embedding such uncertain knowledge represents an unresolved

knowledge-driven applications such as question answering and semantic search by
providing more natural characterization of the knowledge. In this paper, we
propose a novel uncertain KG embedding model UKGE, which aims to preserve both
structural and uncertainty information of relation facts in the embedding
space. Unlike previous models that characterize relation facts with binary
classification techniques, UKGE learns embeddings according to the confidence
scores of uncertain relation facts. To further enhance the precision of UKGE,
we also introduce probabilistic soft logic to infer confidence scores for
unseen relation facts during training. We propose and evaluate two variants of
UKGE based on different learning objectives. Experiments are conducted on three
real-world uncertain KGs via three tasks, i.e. confidence prediction, relation
fact ranking, and relation fact classification. UKGE shows effectiveness in
capturing uncertain knowledge by achieving promising results on these tasks,
and consistently outperforms baselines on these tasks.

redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements from future spectroscopic emission
line galaxy (ELG) surveys such as Euclid are degraded in the presence of
spectral line misidentification. Using analytic calculations verified with mock
galaxy catalogs from log-normal simulations we find that constraints are
degraded in two ways, even when the interloper power spectrum is modeled
correctly in the likelihood. Firstly, there is a loss of signal-to-noise ratio
for the power spectrum of the target galaxies, which propagates to all
cosmological constraints and increases with contamination fraction, $f_c$.
Secondly, degeneracies can open up between $f_c$ and cosmological parameters.
In our calculations this typically increases BAO scale uncertainties at the
10-20% level when marginalizing over parameters determining the broadband power
spectrum shape. External constraints on $f_c$, or parameters determining the
shape of the power spectrum, for example from cosmic microwave background (CMB)
measurements, can remove this effect. There is a near-perfect degeneracy
between $f_c$ and the power spectrum amplitude for low $f_c$ values, where
$f_c$ is not well determined from the contaminated sample alone. This has the
potential to strongly degrade RSD constraints. The degeneracy can be broken
with an external constraint on $f_c$, for example from cross-correlation with a
separate galaxy sample containing the misidentified line, or deeper
sub-surveys.

Existing methods for BAT estimation are tailored to tissue concentration curves
which have a fast upslope to the peak as frequently observed in patient data.
However, they may give poor results for curves that do not have this
characteristic shape such as tissue concentration curves of small animals. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for BAT estimation of signals that do not

to adapt to a large variety of concentration curves. Furthermore, the method
estimates BATs on a continuous time scale. All relevant model parameters are
automatically determined by generalized cross validation. We use simulated
concentration curves of small animal and patient settings to assess the
accuracy and robustness of our approach. The proposed method outperforms a
state-of-the-art method for small animal data and it gives competitive results

Observations of Cool, Low-Gravity Stars'; the last several have compared
empirical measurements of spectral emission lines with models of the winds and
mass-loss of K-giant and supergiants. We have used the Sobolev with Exact

outer atmosphere and wind, to determine and compare the wind characteristics of
the two M-giant stars, $\gamma$~Cru (M3.5III) and $\mu$~Gem (M3IIIab), with
previously derived values for low-gravity K-stars. The analysis specifies the
wind parameters and calculates line profiles for the \ion{Mg}{2} resonance
lines, in addition to a range of unblended \ion{Fe}{2} lines. Our line sample
covers a large range of wind opacities and, therefore, probes a range of
heights in the atmosphere.
  Our results show that $\mu$~Gem has a slower and more turbulent wind then
$\gamma$~Cru. Also, $\mu$~Gem has weaker chromosphere, in terms of surface
flux, with respect to $\gamma$~Cru. This suggests that $\mu$~Gem is more
evolved than $\gamma$~Cru. Comparing the two M-giants in this work with
previously studied K-giant and supergiant stars ($\alpha$~Tau, $\gamma$~Dra,
$\lambda$~Vel) reveals that the M-giants have slower winds than the earlier

geometric computer vision problems. Traditionally, matching has been achieved
by assigning descriptors to interest points and matching points that have
similar descriptors. In this paper, we propose a method by which interest
points are instead already implicitly matched at detection time. With this,
descriptors do not need to be calculated, stored, communicated, or matched any
more. This is achieved by a convolutional neural network with multiple output
channels and can be thought of as a collection of a variety of detectors, each
specialized to specific visual features. This paper describes how to design and
train such a network in a way that results in successful relative pose
estimation performance despite the limitation on interest point count. While
the overall matching score is slightly lower than with traditional methods, the
approach is descriptor free and thus enables localization systems with a
significantly smaller memory footprint and multi-agent localization systems
with lower bandwidth requirements. The network also outputs the confidence for
a specific interest point resulting in a valid match. We evaluate performance
relative to state-of-the-art alternatives.

of the young HIP 79124 triple system. HIP 79124 is a member of the
Scorpius-Centaurus association, consisting of an A0V primary with two low-mass
companions at a projected separation of <1 arcsecond. Thanks to the high
quality wavefront corrections provided by SCExAO, both companions are
decisively detected without the employment of any PSF-subtraction algorithm to
eliminate quasi-static noise. The spectrum of the outer C object is very well
matched by Upper Scorpius M4 pm 0.5 standard spectra, with a Teff = 2945 pm 100
and a mass of 350 MJup. HIP 79124 B is detected at a separation of only 180 mas
in a highly-correlated noise regime, and it falls in the spectral range M6 pm
0.5 with Teff = 2840 pm 190 and 100 MJup. Previous studies of stellar
populations in Sco-Cen have highlighted a discrepancy in isochronal ages
between the lower-mass and higher-mass populations. This could be explained
either by an age spread in the region, or by conventional isochronal models
failing to reproduce the evolution of low-mass stars. The HIP 79124 system
should be coeval, and therefore it provides an ideal laboratory to test these
scenarios. We place the three components in a color-magnitude diagram and find
that the models predict a younger age for the two low-mass companions (3 Myr)
than for the primary star (6 Myr). These results imply that the omission of
magnetic effects in conventional isochronal models inhibit them from
reproducing early low-mass stellar evolution, which is further supported by the
fact that new models that include such effects provide more consistent ages in
the HIP 79124 system.

offering coherent and broadband optical frequency combs, whose bandwidth can be
extended exploiting soliton induced broadening phenomena. Combined with the
ability to miniaturize and integrate on chip, microresonator based soliton Kerr

not rule out the presence of an embedded compact object. We suggest that, in
general, high opacity WR winds could prevent X-ray detections of embedded NS,

intermediate range periodicity in solar activity, in particular the ~155 day
Rieger periodicity in flare activity. It is shown that periodicity at half
integer multiples of the period of Mercury occurs consistently in indices of
solar activity. For this reason the planetary model is based on the triggering
of sunspot emergence when planetary tides peak at times of conjunction of
Mercury with Venus, Earth and/or Jupiter. The periodicity of components in the
planetary model match reasonably well the observed intermediate periodicity in
sunspot and flare activity with the strongest model component occurring at 155
day period. A comparison of filtered versions of the model and the N.O.A.A.
flare index at 155 day periodicity demonstrates the potential for both short
term, (within a solar cycle), and longer term, (over several solar cycles),
predictive capability of the model. However, this assessment finds that
prediction of 155 day periodicity in flare activity is effective only when the
north and south hemispheric components of flare activity are in-phase.

plausibly result from condensation from a corona, the low-metallicity gas is

benefits of image-based rendering and GAN-based image synthesis. The goal of
our method is to generate photo-realistic re-renderings of reconstructed
objects for virtual and augmented reality applications (e.g., virtual
showrooms, virtual tours \& sightseeing, the digital inspection of historical
artifacts). A core component of our work is the handling of view-dependent
effects. Specifically, we directly train an object-specific deep neural network
to synthesize the view-dependent appearance of an object. As input data we are
using an RGB video of the object. This video is used to reconstruct a proxy
geometry of the object via multi-view stereo. Based on this 3D proxy, the
appearance of a captured view can be warped into a new target view as in
classical image-based rendering. This warping assumes diffuse surfaces, in case
of view-dependent effects, such as specular highlights, it leads to artifacts.
To this end, we propose EffectsNet, a deep neural network that predicts
view-dependent effects. Based on these estimations, we are able to convert
observed images to diffuse images. These diffuse images can be projected into
other views. In the target view, our pipeline reinserts the new view-dependent
effects. To composite multiple reprojected images to a final output, we learn a
composition network that outputs photo-realistic results. Using this
image-guided approach, the network does not have to allocate capacity on
``remembering'' object appearance, instead it learns how to combine the
appearance of captured images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
both qualitatively and quantitatively on synthetic as well as on real data.

consisting of an arbitrary number of fluid layers with interfaces separating
fluids of constant viscosity and with positive viscosity jump at each interface
in the direction of flow. Several different time-dependent injection strategies
are analyzed including the maximal injection rate that maintains a stable flow.
We find numerically that flows with more fluid layers can be stable with faster
time-dependent injection rates than comparable flows with fewer fluid layers.
In particular, the injection rate for a stable flow increases at a rate that is
proportional to the number of interfaces to the two-thirds power for large
times. Additionally, we show that in any multi-layer radial Hele-Shaw flow, if
all of the interfaces are circular except for one perturbed interface then
there exists a time-dependent injection rate such that the circular interfaces
remain circular as they propagate and the disturbance on the perturbed
interface decays.
  The motion of the interfaces within linear theory is also investigated
numerically for the case of constant injection rates. It is found that: (i) A
disturbance of one interface can be transferred to the other interface(s); (ii)
The disturbances on the interfaces can develop either in phase or out of phase
from any arbitrary initial disturbance; and (iii) The dynamics of the flow can
change dramatically with the addition of more interfaces.

$\epsilon$-approximations to various properties of random walks on directed

  To achieve our results, we provide a structural result that we believe is of

such directed Laplacian $ {\mathbf{L}}$, there is a lower triangular matrix
$\boldsymbol{\mathit{{\mathfrak{L}}}}$ and an upper triangular matrix
$\boldsymbol{\mathit{{\mathfrak{U}}}}$, each with at most $\tilde{O}(n)$
nonzero entries, such that their product $\boldsymbol{\mathit{{\mathfrak{L}}}}
\boldsymbol{\mathit{{\mathfrak{U}}}}$ spectrally approximates $ {\mathbf{L}}$

utilized to transfer quantum information between the communication and memory
ions and to achieve entanglement swapping between two memory ions. We describe
simple modular quantum repeater architectures realizable with the ion-trap
modules and numerically study the dependence of the quantum key distribution
rate on various experimental parameters, including coupling efficiency, gate
infidelity, operation time and length of the elementary links. Our analysis
suggests crucial improvements necessary in a physical implementation for

access the history and evolution of the outer solar system. However, observing
these faint objects is a difficult task. As a consequence, important properties
such as size and albedo are known for only a small fraction of them. Now, with
the results from deep sky surveys and the Gaia space mission, a new exciting
era is within reach as accurate predictions of stellar occultations by numerous
distant small solar system bodies become available. From them, diameters with
kilometer accuracies can be determined. Albedos, in turn, can be obtained from
diameters and absolute magnitudes. We use observations from the Dark Energy
Survey (DES) from November 2012 until February 2016, amounting to 4292847 CCD
frames. We searched them for all known small solar system bodies and recovered
a total of 202 TNOs and Centaurs, 63 of which have been discovered by the DES
collaboration until the date of this writing. Their positions were determined
using the Gaia Data Release 2 as reference and their orbits were refined.
Stellar occultations were then predicted using these refined orbits plus
stellar positions from Gaia. These predictions are maintained, and updated, in
a dedicated web service. The techniques developed here are also part of an
ambitious preparation to use the data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST), that expects to obtain accurate positions and multifilter photometry
for tens of thousands of TNOs.

through dialogue, have been widely researched. It is required that these
systems have sufficient supporting information to argue their claims
rationally; however, the systems often do not have enough of such information
in realistic situations. One way to fill in the gap is acquiring such missing
information from dialogue partners (information-seeking dialogue). Existing
information-seeking dialogue systems are based on handcrafted dialogue
strategies that exhaustively examine missing information. However, the proposed
strategies are not specialized in collecting information for constructing
rational arguments. Moreover, the number of system's inquiry candidates grows
in accordance with the size of the argument set that the system deal with. In
this paper, we formalize the process of information-seeking dialogue as Markov
decision processes (MDPs) and apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for
automatically optimizing a dialogue strategy. By utilizing DRL, our dialogue
strategy can successfully minimize objective functions, the number of turns it
takes for our system to collect necessary information in a dialogue. We
conducted dialogue experiments using two datasets from different domains of
argumentative dialogue. Experimental results show that the proposed
formalization based on MDP works well, and the policy optimized by DRL
outperformed existing heuristic dialogue strategies.

sequential, mixed multinomial/nested Logit model. These two variants, serving
as based models, are further extended with two features: bounded rationality
(BR) and information sharing. BR is considered by incorporating the
indifference band into the random utility component of the MNL model, forming a
BR-based DTD stochastic model. A macroscopic model of travel information
sharing is integrated into the DTD dynamics to account for the impact of
incomplete information on travelers' SRDT choices. These DTD choice models are
combined with within-day dynamics following the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards

help urban managers to monitor a city's health. Recently, a `drive-by' paradigm
has been proposed in which sensors are deployed on third-party vehicles,
enabling wide coverage at low cost} Research on drive-by sensing has mostly
focused on sensor engineering, but a key question remains unexplored: How many
vehicles would be required to adequately scan a city? Here, we address this
question by analyzing the sensing power of a taxi fleet. Taxis, being numerous
in cities and typically equipped with some sensing technology (e.g. GPS), are
natural hosts for the sensors. Our strategy is to view drive-by sensing as a
spreading process, in which the area of sensed terrain expands as
sensor-equipped taxis diffuse through a city's streets. In tandem with a simple
model for the movements of the taxis, this analogy lets us analytically
determine the fraction of a city's street network sensed by a fleet of taxis
during a day. Our results agree with taxi data obtained from nine major cities,
and reveal that a remarkably small number of taxis can scan a large number of
streets. This finding appears to be universal, indicating its applicability to
cities beyond those analyzed here. Moreover, because taxi motions combine
randomness and regularity (passengers' destinations being random, but the
routes to them being deterministic), the spreading properties of taxi fleets
are unusual; in stark contrast to random walks, the stationary densities of our
taxi model obey Zipf's law, consistent with the empirical taxi data. Our
results have direct utility for town councilors, smart-city designers, and
other urban decision makers.

framework to robustly train deep neural nets (DNNs) that are resistant to

control of transport equations with the practice of training and testing of

ResNets ensemble algorithm to boost the accuracy of the robustly trained model
on both clean and adversarial images. The proposed algorithm consists of two
components: First, we modify the base ResNets by injecting a variance specified
Gaussian noise to the output of each residual mapping. Second, we average over
the production of multiple jointly trained modified ResNets to get the final
prediction. These two steps give an approximation to the Feynman-Kac formula
for representing the solution of a transport equation with viscosity, or a
convection-diffusion equation. For the CIFAR10 benchmark, this simple algorithm
leads to a robust model with a natural accuracy of {\bf 85.62}\% on clean
images and a robust accuracy of ${\bf 57.94 \%}$ under the 20 iterations of the
IFGSM attack, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art in defending
against IFGSM attack on the CIFAR10. Both natural and robust accuracies of the

Here we
analyze a wide-frequency-range (1-8 GHz) sample of high-signal-to-noise,
coherently dedispersed bursts detected using the Arecibo and Green Bank
telescopes. These bursts reveal complex time-frequency structures that include
sub-bursts with finite bandwidths. The frequency-dependent burst structure
complicates the determination of a dispersion measure (DM); we argue that it is
appropriate to use a DM metric that maximizes frequency-averaged pulse
structure, as opposed to peak signal-to-noise, and find DM = 560.57 +/- 0.07
pc/cc at MJD 57644. After correcting for dispersive delay, we find that the
sub-bursts have characteristic frequencies that typically drift lower at later
times in the total burst envelope. In the 1.1-1.7 GHz band, the ~ 0.5-1-ms
sub-bursts have typical bandwidths ranging from 100-400 MHz, and a
characteristic drift rate of ~ 200 MHz/ms towards lower frequencies. At higher
radio frequencies, the sub-burst bandwidths and drift rate are larger, on
average. While these features could be intrinsic to the burst emission
mechanism, they could also be imparted by propagation effects in the medium
local to the source. Comparison of the burst DMs with previous values in the
literature suggests an increase of Delta(DM) ~ 1-3 pc/cc in 4 years, though
this could be a stochastic variation as opposed to a secular trend. This
implies changes in the local medium or an additional source of
frequency-dependent delay. Overall, the results are consistent with previously
proposed scenarios in which FRB 121102 is embedded in a dense nebula.

multiplication technique called Generalized PolyDot codes that advances on
existing methods for coded matrix multiplication under storage and
communication constraints. This technique uses ""garbage alignment,"" i.e.,
aligning computations in coded computing that are not a part of the desired
output. Generalized PolyDot codes bridge between Polynomial codes and MatDot
codes, trading off between recovery threshold and communication costs. Second,
we demonstrate that Generalized PolyDot can be used for training large Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) on unreliable nodes prone to soft-errors. This requires
us to address three additional challenges: (i) prohibitively large overhead of
coding the weight matrices in each layer of the DNN at each iteration; (ii)
nonlinear operations during training, which are incompatible with linear
coding; and (iii) not assuming presence of an error-free master node, requiring
us to architect a fully decentralized implementation without any ""single point
of failure."" We allow all primary DNN training steps, namely, matrix
multiplication, nonlinear activation, Hadamard product, and update steps as
well as the encoding/decoding to be error-prone. We consider the case of
mini-batch size $B=1$, as well as $B>1$, leveraging coded matrix-vector
products, and matrix-matrix products respectively. The problem of DNN training
under soft-errors also motivates an interesting, probabilistic error model
under which a real number $(P,Q)$ MDS code is shown to correct $P-Q-1$ errors
with probability $1$ as compared to $\lfloor \frac{P-Q}{2} \rfloor$ for the
more conventional, adversarial error model. We also demonstrate that our
proposed strategy can provide unbounded gains in error tolerance over a
competing replication strategy and a preliminary MDS-code-based strategy for
both these error models.

This suggests the two types differ qualitatively, rather than in repetition
rate, and are produced by distinct kinds of sources. The absence of periodicity
in repeating FRB argues that they are not produced by neutron stars. They may
originate in dilute relativistic jets produced by low luminosity black hole
accretion. Non-repeating FRB may be produced by catastrophic events such as the
collapse of an accreting magnetic neutron star to a black hole or of an
accreting magnetic white dwarf to a neutron star, during which a disappearing

into a solid angle $\sim \gamma^{-2}$ sterad, reducing the energy requirement.
If powered by magnetic reconnection, a pulse of length $\Delta t$ may draw on

large number of runs in a short period of time to explore a wide parameter
space. Exploring parameter space is particularly important for predicting the
observable properties of exoplanets, for which few parameters are known with
certainty. Therefore, 1D climate models are still very useful tools for
planetary studies. In most of these 1D models, clouds are not physically
represented in the atmosphere, despite having a well-known, significant impact
on a planetary radiative budget. This impact is simulated by artificially
raising surface albedo, in order to reproduce the observed-averaged surface
temperature (i.e. 288 K for modern Earth) and a radiative balance at the top of
the atmosphere. This non-physical representation of clouds, causes atmospheric
longwave and shortwaves fluxes to not match observational data. Additionally,
this technique represents a parameter that is highly-tuned to modern Earth's
climate, and may not be appropriate for planets that deviate from modern
Earth's climate conditions. In this paper, we present an update to the climate
model within the Atmos 1D atmospheric modeling package with a physical
representation of clouds. We show that this physical representation of clouds
in the atmosphere allows both longwave and shortwave fluxes to match

In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework based on deep
Convolutional Neural Networks to automatically detect and localize such frame
duplication. First, an I3D network finds coarse-level matches between candidate
duplicated frame sequences and the corresponding selected original frame
sequences. Then a Siamese network based on ResNet architecture identifies
fine-level correspondences between an individual duplicated frame and the
corresponding selected frame. We also propose a robust statistical approach to
compute a video-level score indicating the likelihood of manipulation or
forgery. Additionally, for providing manipulation localization information we
develop an inconsistency detector based on the I3D network to distinguish the
duplicated frames from the selected original frames. Quantified evaluation on
two challenging video forgery datasets clearly demonstrates that this approach
performs significantly better than four recent state-of-the-art methods.

concatenate features from each domain to represent the input data. Seldom of
them take the quality of data into consideration which is a key issue in
related multimodal problems. In this paper, we propose an efficient
quality-aware deep neural network to model the weight of data from each domain

each domain as a decision-making problem and teach an agent learn to interact
with the environment. The agent can tune the weight of each domain through
discrete action selection and obtain a positive reward if the saliency results
are improved. The target of the agent is to achieve maximum rewards after
finished its sequential action selection. We validate the proposed algorithms
on multimodal saliency detection in a coarse-to-fine way. The coarse saliency
maps are generated from an encoder-decoder framework which is trained with
content loss and adversarial loss. The final results can be obtained via
adaptive weighting of maps from each domain. Experiments conducted on two kinds

discrepancy between the dynamical properties of synaptic plasticity and the
requirements for gradient backpropagation. Learning algorithms that approximate
gradient backpropagation using locally synthesized gradients can overcome this
challenge. Here, we show that synthetic gradients enable the derivation of Deep
Continuous Local Learning (DECOLLE) in spiking neural networks. DECOLLE is
capable of learning deep spatio-temporal representations from spikes relying

systematically from user-defined cost functions and neural dynamics by
leveraging existing autodifferentiation methods of machine learning frameworks.
We benchmark our approach on the MNIST and the event-based neuromorphic

online set cover problem. In this problem, the elements of the ground set that
need to be covered arrive in batches. Our main technical contribution is a
tight $\Omega(H_{m - 2^z + 1})$ lower bound on the competitive ratio of any
fractional batched algorithm given an adversary that is required to produce
batches of VC-dimension at least $z$, for some $z \in \mathbb{N}^0$. This
restriction on the adversary is motivated by the fact that, in some real world
applications, decisions are made after collecting batches of data of
non-trivial VC-dimension. In particular, ridesharing systems rely on the batch
assignment of trip requests to vehicles, and some related problems such as that
of optimal congregation points for passenger pickups and dropoffs can be
modeled as a batched set cover problem with VC-dimension greater than or equal
to two. Furthermore, we note that while any online algorithm may be used to
solve the batched set cover problem by artificially sequencing the elements in
a batch, this procedure may neglect the rich information encoded in the complex
interactions between the elements of a batch and the sets that contain them.
Therefore, we propose a minor modification to an online algorithm found in [8]
to obtain an algorithm that attempts to exploit such information.
Unfortunately, we are unable to improve its analysis in a way that reflects
this intuition. However, we present computational experiments that provide
empirical evidence of a constant factor improvement in the competitive ratio.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use the VC-dimension in the

caused by stellar rotations with star spots, and the amplitude changes as the
spots emerge and decay. The Kepler data are suitable for investigations on the
emergence and decay processes of star spots, which are important to understand
underlying stellar dynamo and stellar flares. In this study, we measured
temporal evolutions of star spot area with Kepler data by tracing local minima
of the light curves. In this analysis, we extracted temporal evolutions of star
spots showing clear emergence and decay without being disturbed by stellar
differential rotations. We applied this method to 5356 active solar-type stars
observed by Kepler and obtained temporal evolutions of 56 individual star
spots. We calculated lifetimes, emergence and decay rates of the star spots
from the obtained temporal evolutions of spot area. As a result, we found that
lifetimes ($T$) of star spots are ranging from 10 to 350 days when spot areas
($A$) are 0.1-2.3 percent of the solar hemisphere. We also compared them with
sunspot lifetimes, and found that the lifetimes of star spots are much shorter
than those extrapolated from an empirical relation of sunspots ($T\propto A$),
while being consistent with other researches on star spot lifetimes. The
emerging and decay rates of star spots are typically $5 \times 10^{20}$ $\rm
Mx\cdot h^{-1}$ ($8$ $\rm MSH\cdot h^{-1}$) with the area of 0.1-2.3 percent of
the solar hemisphere and are mostly consistent with those expected from
sunspots, which may indicate the same underlying processes.

$SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ symmetry of two-massless-quark QCD. For ground-state
nuclei, SU(2) chiral perturbation theory (XPT) enables perturbation in inverse
powers of $\Lambda_{XSB}\simeq 1 GeV$, with analytic operators renormalized to
all loop orders. We show that pion-less ""Static Chiral Nucleon Liquids"" (SXNL)
emerge as a liquid phase of SU(2) XPT of protons, neutrons and 3
Nambu-Goldstone boson pions. Far-IR pions decouple from SXNL, simplifying the
derivation of saturated nuclear matter and microscopic liquid drops

two-massless-quark QCD the power of pion-less SU(2) XPT to capture experimental
ground-state properties of certain nuclides with even parity, spin zero, even

  We derive the SXNL effective SU(2) XPT Lagrangian, including all order

the image and caption are projected into a common latent space so that they can

UV/visible and secondary radiation due to dust (PAHs (polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons), small and large grains) at IR due to partial absorption of the
stellar component. The relative contribution of each grain type to the total
EBL energy density was determined from a combined fit to the Markarian 501
($z\sim 0.034$) SED in flare state, where both the parameters of the intrinsic
source spectrum and the dust fractions were allowed to vary. By separating the
attenuation due to each EBL component, the importance of individual grain types
to the opacity of the extragalactic medium for the TeV emission of a blazar
like Markarian 501 could be better understood. Using a nested log-likelihood
ratio test, we compared null hypotheses represented by effective 1- and 2-grain
models against a 3-grain alternative scenario. When the temperatures of the
grains are fixed a priori, the 1-grain scenario with only PAHs can be excluded
at more than 5$\sigma$, irrespective of the curvature in the intrinsic
spectrum. The 3-grain EBL model with the tuned fractions was finally used to
fit the SEDs of a sample of extragalactic gamma-ray sources. Such a sample is
still dominated by starlight attenuation, therefore, no statistically
significant improvement in the quality of fits was observed when the tuned
fractions are used to account for the EBL attenuation and the intrinsic
spectrum parameters were allowed to vary during the fit. The potential of this

  arXiv:1811.07216",,,"ML4H/2018/28","cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent efforts in Machine Learning (ML) interpretability have focused on
creating methods for explaining black-box ML models. However, these methods
rely on the assumption that simple approximations, such as linear models or
decision-trees, are inherently human-interpretable, which has not been
empirically tested. Additionally, past efforts have focused exclusively on
comprehension, neglecting to explore the trust component necessary to convince
non-technical experts, such as clinicians, to utilize ML models in practice. In
this paper, we posit that reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to learn what
is interpretable to different users and, consequently, build their trust in ML
models. To validate this idea, we first train a neural network to provide risk
assessments for heart failure patients. We then design a RL-based clinical
decision-support system (DSS) around the neural network model, which can learn
from its interactions with users. We conduct an experiment involving a diverse
set of clinicians from multiple institutions in three different countries. Our
results demonstrate that ML experts cannot accurately predict which system
outputs will maximize clinicians' confidence in the underlying neural network
model, and suggest additional findings that have broad implications to the
future of research into ML interpretability and the use of ML in medicine.

measure (PDQ).Unlike AP-based measures, PDQ has no arbitrary thresholds and
rewards spatial and label quality, and foreground/background separation quality
while explicitly penalising false positive and false negative detections. We
contrast PDQ with existing mAP and moLRP measures by evaluating
state-of-the-art detectors and a Bayesian object detector based on Monte Carlo
Dropout. Our experiments indicate that conventional object detectors tend to be
spatially overconfident and thus perform poorly on the task of probabilistic
object detection. Our paper aims to encourage the development of new object
detection approaches that provide detections with accurately estimated spatial
and label uncertainties and are of critical importance for deployment on robots
and embodied AI systems in the real world.

state-triggered constraint formulation that emulates conditionally enforced

to be enabled or disabled by if-statements conditioned on the solution

knowledge, this represents a novel formulation in the optimal control

velocity-triggered angle of attack constraints and range-triggered line of

subproblems. With the aid of virtual control and trust region modifications,
these subproblems are solved in succession until convergence is attained.

high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional binary space is a popular strategy
to learn binary codes. One simiple and intutive method is to utilize two
identical code matrices produced by hash functions to approximate a pairwise
real label matrix. However, the resulting quartic problem is difficult to
directly solve due to the non-convex and non-smooth nature of the objective. In
this paper, unlike previous optimization methods using various relaxation
strategies, we aim to directly solve the original quartic problem using a novel
alternative optimization mechanism to linearize the quartic problem by
introducing a linear regression model. Additionally, we find that gradually
learning each batch of binary codes in a sequential mode, i.e. batch by batch,
is greatly beneficial to the convergence of binary code learning. Based on this
significant discovery and the proposed strategy, we introduce a scalable
symmetric discrete hashing algorithm that gradually and smoothly updates each
batch of binary codes. To further improve the smoothness, we also propose a
greedy symmetric discrete hashing algorithm to update each bit of batch binary
codes. Moreover, we extend the proposed optimization mechanism to solve the
non-convex optimization problems for binary code learning in many other
pairwise based hashing algorithms. Extensive experiments on benchmark
single-label and multi-label databases demonstrate the superior performance of
the proposed mechanism over recent state-of-the-art methods.

and verifying software systems, aiming at making formal verification tools
applicable for mainstream software development. To help the developers of KeY,
its users, and the deductive verification community, we summarize our
experiences with KeY 2.6.1 in specifying and verifying real-world Java code
from a users perspective. To this end, we concentrate on parts of the
Collections-API of OpenJDK 6, where an informal specification exists. While we
describe how we bridged informal and formal specification, we also exhibit
accompanied challenges that we encountered. Our experiences are that (a) in
principle, deductive verification for API-like code bases is feasible, but
requires high expertise, (b) developing formal specifications for existing code
bases is still notoriously hard, and (c) the under-specification of certain
language constructs in Java is challenging for tool builders. Our initial
effort in specifying parts of OpenJDK 6 constitutes a stepping stone towards a
case study for future research.

experiment using a collection of entanglement measures. This includes:
logarithmic negativity, entanglement of formation, distillable entanglement,
relative entropy of entanglement, and squashed entanglement. By considering the
distilled entanglement as a function of the success probability of the

bound on deterministic entanglement distribution at a relatively large

only be able to do so at much lower probabilities, hence demonstrating that
logarithmic negativity alone is inadequate for assessing the performance of the

Under symmetric channel conditions, we have proved that the UCB-Deadline policy

converge to $\delta$-distributions. We relate $T_E \sim

$\sigma_\tau^+$ dominating the means $\mu_\tau^+$. The Lyapunov time

  To better approximate the relaxation time of a graph, we consider a more

Combinatorially, these Schur complements describe random walks in $G$

the divergence of specific heat against entropy, which shows a second-order
phase transition. Moreover, we observe that the quintessence state parameter
$\omega$ shifts the transition point to lower entropy values. Using the concept
of thermodynamic Ruppeiner and Weinhold geometry, we calculated the
thermodynamic curvature scalar $R_R$ and $R_W$ in the quintessence dark energy
regime ($\omega =-2/3$). While these curvature scalars enable us to identify
the critical behavior, they do not show divergence at the phase transition
points observed in specific heat studies. To resolve this puzzle, we have
adopted the method of geometrothermodynamics proposed by Hernando Quevedo.
Choosing a Legendre invariant Quevedo metric, the curvature scalar $R_Q$ shows
singularity at the same point as seen in the specific heat divergence.

hence may not survive in a UV completed theory of gravity. So far, these

consider them in the context of solitonic compact objects made up of scalar

be faithful black hole mimickers, in the sense they possess a light ring, the
criteria fail (are obeyed) for static (rotating) ultracompact boson stars,

by three parameters, the break energy ($E_B$), the power-law indices below

addition of the $\delta_2$ component of the electron spectra, the total flux
density can increase by several times in the optically-thick regime, and by
orders of magnitude in the optically-thin regime; the peak frequency ($\nu_p$)
also increases and can reach up to tens of GHz; and the degree of polarization
($r_c$) decreases in general. We also find that (1) the variation of the flux
density is much larger in the optically-thin regime, and the microwave spectra
around the peak frequency manifest various profiles with the softening or
soft-hard pattern; (2) the parameters $\delta_1$ and $E_B$ affect the microwave
spectral index ($\alpha$) and the degree of polarization ($r_c$) mainly in the
optically-thick regime, while $\delta_2$ mainly affects the optically-thin

This paper respectively addresses fair division of rent, cake, and indivisible
goods among agents with cardinal preferences. We will show that, for all of
these settings and under appropriate valuations, a fair (or an approximately
fair) division among n agents can be efficiently computed using only the
valuations of n-1 agents. The nth (secretive) agent can make an arbitrary
selection after the division has been proposed and, irrespective of her choice,
the computed division will admit an overall fair allocation.
  For the rent-division setting we prove that the (well-behaved) utilities of
n-1 agents suffice to find a rent division among n rooms such that, for every
possible room selection of the secretive agent, there exists an allocation (of
the remaining n-1 rooms among the n-1 agents) which ensures overall envy
freeness (fairness). We complement this existential result by developing a
polynomial-time algorithm that finds such a fair rent division under
quasilinear utilities.
  In this partial information setting, we also develop efficient algorithms to
compute allocations that are envy-free up to one good (EF1) and
epsilon-approximate envy free. These two notions of fairness are applicable in
the context of indivisible goods and divisible goods (cake cutting),
respectively. This work also addresses fairness in terms of proportionality and
maximin shares. Our key result here is an efficient algorithm that, even with a
secretive agent, finds a 1/19-approximate maximin fair allocation (of
indivisible goods) under submodular valuations of the non-secretive agents.
  One of the main technical contributions of this paper is the development of
novel connections between different fair-division paradigms, e.g., we use our
existential results for envy-free rent-division to develop an efficient EF1
algorithm.

survey is the latest way of sky observation. Compared to traditional sky survey
who can only find astronomical phenomena, STLF sky survey can even reveal how
short astronomical phenomena evolve. The difference does not only lead the new
survey data but also the new analysis style. It requires that database behind
STLF sky survey should support continuous analysis on data streaming, real-time
analysis on short-term data and complex analysis on long-term historical data.
In addition, both insertion and query latencies have strict requirements to
ensure that scientific phenomena can be discovered. However, the existing
databases cannot support our scenario. In this paper, we propose AstroServ, a
distributed system for analysis and management of large-scale and full
life-cycle astronomical data. AstroServ's core components include three data
service layers and a query engine. Each data service layer serves for a
specific time period of data and query engine can provide the uniform analysis
interface on different data. In addition, we also provide many applications
including interactive analysis interface and data mining tool to help
scientists efficiently use data. The experimental results show that AstroServ
can meet the strict performance requirements and the good recognition accuracy.

nanomodification for plasmonic or sensoric applications. There are many papers
devoted to this problem. But all of them are concentrated on dynamics of a
film, paying small attention to substrate. In these papers the substrate is
just an object absorbing the first shock. Here we present another point of view
directed onto dynamics of a substrate. We consider (i) generation of a shock
wave (SW) in a support by impact of a contact; (ii) transition from
one-dimensional to two-dimensional (2D) propagation of SW; (iii) we analyze
lateral propagation of the SW along a film-support contact; and (iv) we
calculate pressure in the compressed layer behind the decaying SW. This
positive pressure acting from substrate to the film accelerates the film in
direction to vacuum. Above some threshold, velocity of accelerated film is
enough to separate the film from support. In these cases the circle of
separation is significantly wider than the circle of the focal laser spot on
film surface. Absorbed laser heat exponentially decays around an irradiated
spot $F=F_{\rm c} \exp(-r^2/R_{\rm L}^2)$, where $R_{\rm L}$ is radius of a
Gaussian beam, $F$ and $F_{\rm c}$ are local and central fluences, $r$ is a
radius from the axis. While the law of decay for the 2D SW in substrate is the
power law. Therefore in our case of powerful laser action the edge of a
separation circle is defined by propagation of the SW in the support.

observation infrastructures are developed, the sky survey cycles have been
shortened from a few days to a few seconds, causing data processing pressure to
shift from offline to online. However, existing scientific databases focus on
offline analysis of long-term historical data, not real-time and low latency
analysis of large-scale newly arriving data.
  In this paper, a cloud based method is proposed to efficiently analyze
scientific events on large-scale newly arriving data. The solution is
implemented as a highly efficient system, namely Aserv. A set of compact data
store and index structures are proposed to describe the proposed scientific
events and a typical analysis pattern is formulized as a set of query
operations. Domain aware filter, accuracy aware data partition, highly
efficient index and frequently used statistical data designs are four key
methods to optimize the performance of Aserv. Experimental results under the
typical cloud environment show that the presented optimization mechanism can
meet the low latency demand for both large data insertion and scientific event
analysis. Aserv can insert 3.5 million rows of data within 3 seconds and
perform the heaviest query on 6.7 billion rows of data also within 3 seconds.
Furthermore, a performance model is given to help Aserv choose the right cloud

eigenvector computation for numerically sparse matrices. Given a data matrix $A
\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ where every row $a \in \mathbb{R}^d$ has
$\|a\|_2^2 \leq L$ and numerical sparsity at most $s$, i.e. $\|a\|_1^2 /
\|a\|_2^2 \leq s$, we provide faster algorithms for these problems in many
parameter settings.
  For top eigenvector computation, we obtain a running time of $\tilde{O}(nd +
r(s + \sqrt{r s}) / \mathrm{gap}^2)$ where $\mathrm{gap} > 0$ is the relative
gap between the top two eigenvectors of $A^\top A$ and $r$ is the stable rank
of $A$. This running time improves upon the previous best unaccelerated running
time of $O(nd + r d / \mathrm{gap}^2)$ as it is always the case that $r \leq d$
and $s \leq d$.
  For regression, we obtain a running time of $\tilde{O}(nd + (nL / \mu)
\sqrt{s nL / \mu})$ where $\mu > 0$ is the smallest eigenvalue of $A^\top A$.
This running time improves upon the previous best unaccelerated running time of
$\tilde{O}(nd + n L d / \mu)$. This result expands the regimes where regression
can be solved in nearly linear time from when $L/\mu = \tilde{O}(1)$ to when $L
/ \mu = \tilde{O}(d^{2/3} / (sn)^{1/3})$.
  Furthermore, we obtain similar improvements even when row norms and numerical
sparsities are non-uniform and we show how to achieve even faster running times
by accelerating using approximate proximal point [Frostig et. al. 2015] /
catalyst [Lin et. al. 2015]. Our running times depend only on the size of the
input and natural numerical measures of the matrix, i.e. eigenvalues and
$\ell_p$ norms, making progress on a key open problem regarding optimal running
times for efficient large-scale learning.

We have determined the band-gap value of non-doped BaCd2As2 to be 0.40 eV from
the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity. Both the electrical
resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient decrease with hole doping, leading to a
power factor value of 1.28 mW m-1 K-2 at 762 K for x = 0.04. A first-principles
band calculation shows that the relatively large power factor mainly originates
from the two-fold degeneracy of the bands comprising As px,y orbitals and from
the anisotropic band structure at the valence-band maximum. The lattice thermal
conductivity is suppressed by the K doping to 0.46 W m-1 K-1 at 773 K for x =
0.08, presumably due to randomness. The effect of randomness is compensated by
an increase in the electronic thermal conductivity, which keeps the total
thermal conductivity approximately constant. In consequence, the dimensionless

radio sources of the `fog-like' two-phase model of the circumgalactic medium
recently proposed by McCourt et al.(2018). In this model, the CGM consists of a
diffuse coronal gas ($T\gtrsim 10^6\,$K) in pressure equilibrium with numerous
$\lesssim 1\,$pc scale cool clumps or `cloudlets' formed by shattering in a
cooling instability. The areal filling factor of the cloudlets is expected to
exceed unity in $\gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_\odot$ haloes, and the ensuing radio-wave
scattering is akin to that caused by turbulence in the Galactic warm ionized
medium (WIM). If $30\,$per-cent of cosmic baryons are in the CGM, we show that
for a cool-gas volume fraction of $f_{\rm v}\sim 10^{-3}$, sources at $z_{\rm
s}\sim 1$ suffer angular broadening by $\sim 15\,\mu$as and temporal broadening
by $\sim 1\,$ms at $\lambda = 30\,$cm, due to scattering by the clumps in
intervening CGM. The former prediction will be difficult to test (the angular
broadening will suppress Galactic scintillation only for $<10\,\mu$Jy compact
synchrotron sources). However the latter prediction, of temporal broadening of
localized fast radio bursts, can constrain the size and mass fraction of cool
ionized gas clumps as function of halo mass and redshift, and thus provides a
test of the model proposed by McCourt et al.(2018).

attractive and depends on the penetration length as well as the layer spacing.
The strongest effect occurs for tightly confined fluctuations, in which the
surface anchoring energy is set to infinity, where the force per area scales
linearly with the thermal energy and inversely with the fourth power of the
intersubstrate separation. By reducing the strength of the surface anchoring
energy, the force first becomes weaker in magnitude but then increases in
magnitude as the surface anchoring strength is further reduced down to zero, in

size of the MAX-CUT. On the other extreme, for any fixed $\epsilon > 0$, if one
allows $\tilde{O}(n)$ space, a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution to the
MAX-CUT value can be obtained by storing an $\tilde{O}(n)$-size sparsifier that
essentially preserves MAX-CUT value.
  Our main result is that any (randomized) single pass streaming algorithm that
breaks the $2$-approximation barrier requires $\Omega(n)$-space, thus resolving
the space complexity of any non-trivial approximations of the MAX-CUT value to
within polylogarithmic factors in the single pass streaming model. We achieve
the result by presenting a tight analysis of the Implicit Hidden Partition
Problem introduced by Kapralov et al.[SODA'17] for an arbitrarily large number
of players. In this problem a number of players receive random matchings of
$\Omega(n)$ size together with random bits on the edges, and their task is to
determine whether the bits correspond to parities of some hidden bipartition,
or are just uniformly random.
  Unlike all previous Fourier analytic communication lower bounds, our analysis
does not directly use bounds on the $\ell_2$ norm of Fourier coefficients of a
typical message at any given weight level that follow from hypercontractivity.
Instead, we use the fact that graphs received by players are sparse (matchings)
to obtain strong upper bounds on the $\ell_1$ norm of the Fourier coefficients
of the messages of individual players, and then argue, using the convolution
theorem, that similar strong bounds on the $\ell_1$ norm are essentially
preserved once messages of different players are combined.

regard to the local environment is important to obtain in-depth understanding
of their behavior in the aquatic environment. In the present research, to
examine an impact of the shape and gravity on a swimming strategy, plankton is
considered as settling swimming particles of ellipsoidal shape. The Q-learning
approach is adopted to obtain swimming strategies for smart particles with a
goal of efficiently moving upwards in a two-dimensional steady flow. Strategies
obtained from reinforcement learning are compared to those of naive gyrotactic
particles that is modeled considering the behavior of realistic plankton. It is
found that elongation of particles improves the performance of upward swimming
by facilitating particles' resistance to the perturbation of vortex. In the
case when the settling velocity is included, the strategy obtained by
reinforcement learning has similar performance to that of the naive gyrotactic
one, and they both align swimmers in upward direction. The similarity between
the strategy obtained from machine learning and the biological gyrotactic
strategy indicates the relationship between the aspherical shape and settling
effect of realistic plankton and their gyrotactic feature.

engineering practice is the use of data obtained from physical structures such
as bridges, viaducts and buildings. These data can represent how the structure
responds to various stimuli over time when in operation, providing engineers
with a unique insight into how their designs are performing. With the advent of
advanced sensing technologies and the Internet of Things, the efficient
interpretation of structural health monitoring data has become a big data
challenge. Many models have been proposed in literature to represent such data,
such as linear statistical models. Based upon these models, the health of the
structure is reasoned about, e.g. through damage indices, changes in likelihood
and statistical parameter estimates. On the other hand, physics-based models
are typically used when designing structures to predict how the structure will
respond to operational stimuli. What remains unclear in the literature is how
to combine the observed data with information from the idealised physics-based
model into a model that describes the responses of the operational structure.
This paper introduces a new approach which fuses together observed data from a
physical structure during operation and information from a mathematical model.
The observed data are combined with data simulated from the physics-based model
using a multi-output Gaussian process formulation. The novelty of this method
is how the information from observed data and the physics-based model is
balanced to obtain a representative model of the structures response to
stimuli. We present our method using data obtained from a fibre-optic sensor
network installed on experimental railway sleepers. We discuss how this
approach can be used to reason about changes in the structures behaviour over
time using simulations and experimental data.

investigate the movement characteristics of elders in the straight corridor and
compare them with that of young adults. The free speeds of the elderly (about
1.28m/s) are obviously slower than that of the young people (about 1.4m/s) in
the laboratory experiments. It was found that the fundamental diagram of the
elderly shows the similar trend compared with that of young pedestrians.
However, at the same densities the speeds of the elderly are always lower than
that of the young pedestrians in the observed density range (< 3.0 m2). When
the mean velocity calculated from pedestrian movement at low densities is
considered, the two normalized fundamental diagrams agree quite well. The
reasons for the differences are explored by analyzing the border distance, the
nearest neighbors as well as the spatial distribution areas of the pedestrians.
Our findings can be useful for the improvement of the pedestrian modelling and
the design of pedestrian facilities that are much friendlier to the elderly.

combining the standard bi-linear sampler with a deep network based image
sampling model (DIS-NET) to provide better image reconstruction capabilities on

While DIS-NET provides higher order regression and larger input search space,
the bi-linear sampler provides geometric constraints necessary for reducing the
size of the solution space for an ill-posed problem of this kind. This
combination is shown to provide significant improvement in depth and pose
estimation accuracy outperforming all existing state-of-the-art methods in this

(Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) model of the Boltzmann kinetic equation to be suitable
for studying the influence of centrifugal field affected on gases mixture. The
scientific achievement of the new model is that it is a very simple model
without any mathematical complexity; but without any loss of generality. We
shed light upon that the new model is satisfied the conservation of energy,
conservation of mass, and conservation of momentum laws, the second law of
thermodynamic, and the principle of maximum entropy production that is like the
BGK model itself. Complete mathematical model for a centrifugal field, used in
Uranium enrichment process affected on gases mixture between two coaxial
circular porous rotating cylinders, is presented which is an important
application for our new model. We also, introduced the complete irreversible
thermodynamics properties of the system for the first time at all, for the best
of our knowledge. The entropy, entropy flux, entropy production, thermodynamic
forces, kinetic coefficients are presented for our model system. The ratios
between the different contributions of the internal energy changes are
predicted via the extended Gibbs equation. The main important implementation of
the model is the uranium enrichment that is used in nuclear energy generation

applications. The flow of a binary gases mixture of UF6, and N2 between

recurrent neural models. While training is restricted to a simple output
component, the recurrent connections are left untrained after initialization,
subject to stability constraints specified by the Echo State Property (ESP).
Literature conditions for the ESP typically fail to properly account for the
effects of driving input signals, often limiting the potentialities of the RC
approach. In this paper, we study the fundamental aspect of asymptotic
stability of RC models in presence of driving input, introducing an empirical
ESP index that enables to easily analyze the stability regimes of reservoirs.
Results on two benchmark datasets reveal interesting insights on the dynamical
properties of input-driven reservoirs, suggesting that the actual domain of ESP
validity is much wider than what covered by literature conditions commonly used
in RC practice.

networks to replace 2D recurrent layers with 1D, and in some cases even
completely remove the recurrent layers, relying on simple feed-forward
convolutional only architectures. The most used type of recurrent layer is the
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). The motivations to do so are many: there are few
open-source implementations of 2D-LSTM, even fewer supporting GPU
implementations (currently cuDNN only implements 1D-LSTM); 2D recurrences
reduce the amount of computations that can be parallelized, and thus possibly
increase the training/inference time; recurrences create global dependencies
with respect to the input, and sometimes this may not be desirable.
  Many recent competitions were won by systems that employed networks that use
2D-LSTM layers. Most previous work that compared 1D or pure feed-forward
architectures to 2D recurrent models have done so on simple datasets or did not
fully optimize the ""baseline"" 2D model compared to the challenger model, which
was dully optimized.
  In this work, we aim at a fair comparison between 2D and competing models and
also extensively evaluate them on more complex datasets that are more
representative of challenging ""real-world"" data, compared to ""academic""
datasets that are more restricted in their complexity. We aim at determining
when and why the 1D and 2D recurrent models have different results. We also
compare the results with a language model to assess if linguistic constraints
do level the performance of the different networks.
  Our results show that for challenging datasets, 2D-LSTM networks still seem
to provide the highest performances and we propose a visualization strategy to
explain it.

with accretion of solids followed by a buildup of a gaseous atmosphere as more
solids are accreted, and finally, by rapid accretion of gas. The interaction of
the solids with the gaseous envelope determines the subsequent planetary growth
and the final internal structure. In this work we simulate the interaction of
planetesimals with a growing giant planet (proto-Jupiter) and investigate how
different treatments of the planetesimal-envelope interaction affect the
heavy-element distribution, and the inferred core mass. We consider various
planetesimal sizes and compositions as well as different ablation and radiation
efficiencies, and fragmentation models. We find that in most cases the core
reaches a maximum mass of 2 Earth's Mass. We show that the value of the core's
mass mainly depends on the assumed size and composition of the solids, while
the heavy-element distribution is also affected by the fate of the accreted
planetesimals (ablation/fragmentation). Fragmentation, which is found to be
important for planetesimals > 1 km, typically leads to enrichment of the inner
part of the envelope while ablation results in enrichment of the outer
atmosphere. Finally, we present a semi-analytical prescription for deriving the

and efficient solutions to egocentric hand segmentation is becoming critical.
Traditional segmentation techniques typically follow a one-shot approach, where
the image is passed forward only once through a model that produces a
segmentation mask. This strategy, however, does not reflect the perception of
humans, who continuously refine their representation of the world. In this
paper, we therefore introduce a novel gated recurrent architecture. It goes
beyond both iteratively passing the predicted segmentation mask through the
network and adding a standard recurrent unit to it. Instead, it incorporates
multiple encoder-decoder layers of the segmentation network, so as to keep
track of its internal state in the refinement process. As evidenced by our
results on standard hand segmentation benchmarks and on our own dataset, our
approach outperforms these other, simpler recurrent segmentation techniques, as
well as the state-of-the-art hand segmentation one. Furthermore, we demonstrate
the generality of our approach by applying it to road segmentation, where it
also outperforms other baseline methods.

and relations between users, social network graphs have to be anonymised before
publication. Naive anonymisation of social network graphs often consists in
deleting all identifying information of the users, while maintaining the
original graph structure. Various types of attacks on naively anonymised graphs
have been developed. Active attacks form a special type of such privacy
attacks, in which the adversary enrols a number of fake users, often called
sybils, to the social network, allowing the adversary to create unique
structural patterns later used to re-identify the sybil nodes and other users
after anonymisation. Several studies have shown that adding a small amount of
noise to the published graph already suffices to mitigate such active attacks.
Consequently, active attacks have been dubbed a negligible threat to
privacy-preserving social graph publication. In this paper, we argue that these
studies unveil shortcomings of specific attacks, rather than inherent problems
of active attacks as a general strategy. In order to support this claim, we
develop the notion of a robust active attack, which is an active attack that is
resilient to small perturbations of the social network graph. We formulate the
design of robust active attacks as an optimisation problem and we give
definitions of robustness for different stages of the active attack strategy.
Moreover, we introduce various heuristics to achieve these notions of
robustness and experimentally show that the new robust attacks are considerably
more resilient than the original ones, while remaining at the same level of
feasibility.

rays is represented by a symplectic ABCD transfer matrix defined on a reduced

from simultaneously applied null geodesic actions for two curves, we obtain a
geodesic deviation action up to quadratic order. We achieve this by following a
preexisting method constructed via Synge's world function. We find the
corresponding Hamiltonian function and the reduced phase space coordinates that
are composed of the components of the Jacobi fields projected on an
observational screen. Our thin ray bundle transfer matrix is then obtained
through the matrix representation of the Lie operator associated with this
quadratic Hamiltonian. Moreover, Etherington's distance reciprocity between any
two points is shown to be equivalent to the symplecticity conditions of our ray
bundle transfer matrix. We further interpret the bundle propagation as a free
canonical transformation with a generating function that is equal to the
geodesic deviation action. We present it in the form of matrix inner products.
A phase space distribution function and the associated Liouville equation is
also provided. Finally, we briefly sketch the potential applications of our
construction. Those include reduced phase space and null bundle averaging;
factorization of light propagation in any spacetime uniquely into its thin

re-analysed the spectrum of the XMM-Newton/INTEGRAL observation of 4U 1702-429
in the 0.3-60 keV energy range and we extracted three 0.1-100 keV spectra of
the source analysing three observations collected with the BeppoSAX satellite.
We find that the XMM-Newton/INTEGRAL spectrum is well fitted using a model
composed of a disc blackbody plus a Comptonised component and a smeared
reflection component. We used the same spectral model for the BeppoSAX spectra,
finding out that the addition of a smeared reflection component is
statistically significant. The best-fit values of the parameters are compatible
to each other for the BeppoSAX spectra. We find that the reflection fraction is
$0.05^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$ for the XMM-Newton/INTEGRAL spectrum and between 0.15
and 0.4 for BeppoSAX ones. The relative reflection fraction and the ionisation
parameter are incompatible between the XMM-Newton/INTEGRAL and the BeppoSAX
observations and the characteristics of the Comptonising corona suggest that
the source was in a soft state in the former observation and in a hard state in
the latter.

Molecular dynamics simulations have been widely used to study collision

geometrical and topological histograms of its angles and distances which can
then be used as similarity metrics. The technique is demonstrated by matching
similar clusters for different cluster shapes like ring, crowdions etc. in a
database of cascade damage configurations in Fe and W at different energies. We
further use graph based dimensionality reduction techniques and unsupervised
machine learning on the features of all the clusters present in the database to
find classes of clusters. The classification successfully separates out many
already known categories of clusters such as crowdions, planar crowdion pairs,
rings and perpendicular crowdions. The dimensionality and size of different
classes provides a broad categorization of classes. The distribution of
different classes of shapes among cascades of different elements and energies
shows the exclusivity of shapes to elements and energies. We discuss the key
points and computational efficiency of the algorithms along with the various
prominent results of their application. We discuss the motivation for using
machine learning and statistics for the problems and compare different
techniques. The algorithms along with the supporting analysis and
visualizations give an unsupervised approach for classification and study of
defect clusters in cascades. The distribution of cluster shapes and structures
along with the shape properties like diffusivity, stability, etc. can be used

features of the phase transition leading twin-star configurations and, at the
same time, fulfilling the constraints coming from the maximum mass of
$2M_\odot$ and the information following gravitational-wave event GW170817. In
particular, we use a general equation of state for the neutron-star matter that
parametrizes the hadron-quark phase transition between the model describing the
hadronic phase and a constant speed of sound for the quark phase. We find that
the largest number of twin-star solutions has masses in the neutron-star branch
in the range $1-2M_\odot$ and twin-branch masses $\gtrsim 2M_\odot$. The
analysis of the masses, radii and tidal deformabilities also reveals that when
twin stars appear, the tidal deformability shows two distinct branches with the
same mass, thus differing considerably from the behaviour expected for neutron
stars. In addition, we find that the data from GW170817 is compatible with the
existence of hybrid stars and could also be interpreted as produced by the
merger of a binary system of hybrid stars or of a hybrid star with a neutron
star. The presence of a hybrid star in the inspiral phase can be established
clearly if future gravitational-wave detections measure chirp masses

relations between the droplet motions and the liquid properties have been
seldom investigated, although they are very critical for the printing accuracy.
In this study, experiments and computational simulation regarding deformation
of a single droplet driven by a piezoelectric nozzle have been conducted to
address the deformation characteristics of droplets. It is found that the
droplet deformation is influenced by the pressure wave propagation in the ink
channel related to the driven parameters and reflected in the subsequent
droplet motions. The deformation extent oscillates with a certain period of T
and a decreasing amplitude as the droplet moves downwards. The deformation
extent is found strongly dependent on the capillary number (Ca), first ascended
and then descended as the number increases. The maximum value of the
deformation extent is surprisingly found to be within range of 0.68-0.82 of the
Ca number regardless of other factors. Furthermore, the Rayleigh's linear
relation of the oscillation frequency of the droplet to the
parameter,({\sigma}/(\r{ho}r^3))^(1/2), is updated with a smaller slope shown
both by experiments and simulation.

photo-nuclear dijets in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC to further
constrain the nuclear PDFs. These events can be described as $\gamma$A
collisions where the relevant part of the flux of quasi-real photons from
heavy-ions is obtained by using the equivalent photon approximation and cutting
out impact-parameter values which would lead to hadronic interactions between
the beam particles. In particular, we quantify the small-$x$ reach with
different jet kinematics and show how well the values of $x$ derived from
reconstructed jet momenta are correlated with the actual values of partonic
momentum fractions probed in these measurements. Also the contributions from
direct and resolved photons are separately presented. To demonstrate the
potential, we compare the expected experimental uncertainties to the current
nuclear-PDF errors and discuss other theoretical uncertainties including the
uncertainty arising from poorly-constrained photon PDFs. We find that such a
measurement would potentially provide a considerable reduction of the nuclear
PDF uncertainties in a region $10^{-4} \lesssim x \lesssim 10^{-2}$.

molecular hydrogen is pressured to high pressure at low temperature about 80
years ago. Furthermore, the solid metallic hydrogen was theoretically predicted
to show superconductivity at room temperature. In addition, surprising
prediction was made that the solid metallic hydrogen is a metastable metal with
a potential barrier of 1 eV. This prediction implies that the solid metallic
hydrogen remains in the metallic solid phase state even after it is released
from high pressure. Shock compression synthesized liquid metallic hydrogen so
far. However, to obtain metallic hydrogen under ambient pressure at room
temperature, it is necessary to synthesize solid metallic hydrogen. It is
theoretically predicted that an ultrahigh pressure of ~500 GPa is required to
produce solid metallic hydrogen. This pressure is close to the limit of the
high pressure that can be generated by the diamond anvil cell (DAC). Therefore,
it is difficult to synthesize metallic hydrogen by using DAC. Shock compression
methods can generate a sufficiently high pressure to synthesize metallic
hydrogen. But it is impossible to synthesize solid metallic hydrogen by these
methods because these accompany generation of high temperature. There is
currently no definitive way to synthesize solid metallic hydrogen.
  Here we report a new dynamic high-pressure apparatus which aims for synthesis
of solid metallic hydrogen. We show that by using this apparatus, it is
possible to generate a high pressure of 1 TPa, the pressure maintaining time is
103 to 106 times longer than the conventional dynamic compression method.
Furthermore, we show that this apparatus is not accompanied by the generation
of high temperature unlike the conventional dynamic compression method and then
it is possible that solid metallic hydrogen might be synthesized by this

smaller galaxies, questioning the paradigm that dwarf galaxies do not harbour
central massive black holes. Even if such black holes exist, feeding them by
gas streams is difficult, since star formation should be more efficient than
AGN feeding in dwarf galaxies. In this paper, I investigate the possibility
that tidal disruptions of stars are responsible for the observed AGN in dwarf
galaxies. I show that the expected duty cycles of TDE-powered AGN, $f_{\rm AGN}
\geq 0.5\%$, are consistent with observed AGN fractions assuming that the
occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies is close to unity. Furthermore, I
calculate the properties of outflows driven by TDE-powered AGN under idealised
conditions and find that they might have noticeable effects on the host
galaxies. Outflows themselves might not be detectable, except in gas-poor
galaxies, where they can accelerate to $v_{\rm out} > 100$~km/s, but increased
gas turbulence, more diffuse density profile and lower star formation
efficiency can be discovered and used to constrain the black hole occupancy
fraction and more nuanced effects on dwarf galaxy evolution. If massive black
holes form from seeds that are much more massive than stellar black holes, then
their outflows should be easily detectable; this result, aided by observations
of high-redshift dwarf galaxies, provides a potential way of determining seed
masses of black holes.

train our network using two methods for two different goals. Firstly we train
our network based on mean square error (MSE) only, aiming to obtain highest
PSNR values at frame prediction and video compression. Secondly we use
adversarial training to produce visually more realistic frame predictions. For
frame prediction, we compare our method with the baseline methods of frame
difference and 16x16 block motion compensation. For video compression we
further include x264 video codec in the comparison. We show that in frame
prediction, adversarial training produces frames that look sharper and more
realistic, compared MSE based training, but in video compression it
consistently performs worse. This proves that even though adversarial training
is useful for generating video frames that are more pleasing to the human eye,
they should not be employed for video compression. Moreover, our network
trained with MSE produces accurate frame predictions, and in quantitative
results, for both tasks, it produces comparable results in all videos and
outperforms other methods on average. More specifically, learned frame
prediction outperforms other methods in terms of rate-distortion performance in

control (MAC) layer behaviors in legacy networks. In this paper, we argue that
the frequency domain can serve as a free side channel with minimal
interruptions to legacy networks. To this end, we propose DopplerFi, a
communication framework that enables a two-way communication channel between
BLE and Wi-Fi by injecting artificial Doppler shifts, which can be decoded by
sensing the patterns in the Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK) demodulator
and Channel State Information (CSI). The artificial Doppler shifts can be
compensated by the inherent frequency synchronization module and thus have a
negligible impact on legacy communications. Our evaluation using commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) BLE chips and 802.11-compliant testbeds have demonstrated
that DopplerFi can achieve throughput up to 6.5~Kbps at the cost of merely less
than 0.8% throughput loss.

the weekly incidents are available. In addition to date and hashtag count
features of online posts, we were able to utilize also the visual content of
the posted images with the help of deep convolutional neural networks. Our best
nowcasting model reached a mean absolute error of 11.33 incidents per week and
a correlation coefficient of 0.963 on the test data. Forecasting models for
predicting 1 week and 2 weeks ahead showed statistical significance as well by
reaching correlation coefficients of 0.903 and 0.862, respectively. This study
demonstrates how social media and in particular, digital photographs shared in

modeling. We also used the available astrometric observations of Phaethon,
including those obtained by the Arecibo radar and the Gaia spacecraft, to
constrain the secular drift of the orbital semimajor axis. This constraint
allowed us to estimate the bulk density by assuming that the drift is dominated
by the Yarkovsky effect. We used the convex inversion model to derive the 3D
shape model of Phaethon, and a detailed numerical approach for an accurate
analysis of the Yarkovsky effect. We obtained a unique solution for Phaethon's
pole orientation at $(318,-47)^{\circ}$ ecliptic longitude and latitude
(uncertainty of $5^{\circ}$), and confirm the previously reported
thermophysical properties ($D=5.1\pm0.2$ km, $\Gamma=600\pm200$ SI). Phaethon
has a top-like shape with possible north-south asymmetry. The characteristic
size of the regolith grains is 1-2 cm. The orbit analysis reveals a secular
drift of the semimajor axis of $-(6.9\pm1.9)\times 10^{-4}$ au Myr$^{-1}$. With
the derived volume-equivalent size of 5.1~km, the bulk density $\rho$ is
$1.67\pm0.47$ g cm$^{-3}$. If the size is slightly larger $\sim5.7$ km, as
suggested by radar data, $\rho$ would decrease to $1.48\pm0.42$ g cm$^{-3}$. We
further investigated the suggestion that Phaethon may be in a cluster with
asteroids (155140) 2005 UD and (225416) 1999 YC that was formed by rotational
fission of a critically spinning parent body. Phaethon's $\rho$ is consistent
with typical values for large ($>100$ km) C-complex asteroids and supports its
association with asteroid (2) Pallas. These findings render a cometary origin
unlikely for Phaethon.

several (weighted, smooth) empirical copula processes both in the case of

rates of acquisition and clearance of colonizing populations. Studies of
colonization dynamics have been based on assessment of whether serial samples
represent a single population or distinct colonization events. A common
solution to estimate acquisition and clearance rates is to use a fixed genetic
distance threshold. However, this approach is often inadequate to account for
the diversity of the underlying within-host evolving population, the time
intervals between consecutive measurements, and the uncertainty in the
estimated acquisition and clearance rates. Here, we summarize recently
submitted work \cite{jarvenpaa2018named} and present a Bayesian model that
provides probabilities of whether two strains should be considered the same,
allowing to determine bacterial clearance and acquisition from genomes sampled

work addresses this issue by examining the Morris-Lecar neural model driven by
symmetric \alpha-stable L\'evy motion. Two deterministic indices: the first
escape probability and the mean first exit time, are adopted to analyse the
state transition in this stochastic model. We calculate both indices in order
to understand the transition from the escape region to the target region, and
the area of higher indices in escape region. Additionally, we consider the
special case of (Gaussian) Brownian motion to compare with (non-Gaussian)
L\'evy motion case. Our main results indicate that higher first escape
probability promotes the transition, while the mean first exit time reflects
the stability of the rest state with the selected escape region. The higher
non-Gaussianity index and relatively small noise intensity are more prone to
produce spikes. Moreover, by calculating both deterministic indices as
functions of noise intensity ratio and non-Gaussianity index, we find that the
effect of ion channel noise is more pronounced on the stochastic Morris-Lecar
model than noise in the current. This work provides some mathematical
understanding about the impact of non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed, burst-like
fluctuations on excitable systems such as the Morris-Lecar system.

items and reorder the results. This regards two tasks of image search and text
matching as two different tasks. Our method, however, explore the vast data to
compute k-nearest neighbors using both image and text.
  In our experiment of similar item search, our system using multimodal data
shows better performance than single data while it only increases minute

Telescope (LAT) from the \textit{Fermi} Bubbles (FBs) at the Galactic center is
still uncertain. In a hadronic model, acceleration of protons and/or nuclei and
their subsequent interactions with gas in the bubble volume can produce the
observed gamma rays. Recently the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)
observatory reported an absence of gamma-ray excess from the Northern FB at
$b\gtrsim 6^\circ$ Galactic latitude, which resulted in flux upper limits in
the energy range of $1.2-126$ TeV. These upper limits are consistent with the
gamma-ray spectrum measured by \textit{Fermi}-LAT at $|b|\ge 10^\circ$, where
an exponential cutoff at energies $\gtrsim 100$ GeV is evident. However, the FB
gamma-ray spectrum at $|b|\le 10^\circ$, without showing any sign of cutoff up
to around 1 TeV in the latest results, remains unconstrained. The upcoming
Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will perform a Galactic center survey with
unprecedented sensitivity in the energy between 20 GeV and 300 TeV. In this
work, we perform both morphological and classic on/off analyses with planned
CTA deep central and extended survey and estimate the sensitivity of CTA to the
FB hadronic gamma-ray flux models that best fit the spectrum at $|b|\le
10^\circ$ and whose counterpart neutrino flux model best fits the optimistic
neutrino spectrum from IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We also perform
sensitivity analysis with a future ground-based Cherenkov detector the Large
High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We find that CTA will be able to
discover or constrain the FB gamma-ray flux at $|b|\le 10^\circ$ in the
$\approx$ 200 GeV -- 100 TeV range with planned observation strategy, while
LHAASO may constrain emission in the $\approx 100$~GeV -- 100~TeV range if

many scientific and engineering applications. How a material behaves when
subjected to high or fluctuating temperatures can be critical to the safety and
longevity of a system's essential components. The laser flash experiment is a
well-established technique for indirectly measuring the thermal diffusivity,
and hence the thermal conductivity, of a material. In previous works,
optimization schemes have been used to find estimates of the thermal
conductivity and other quantities of interest which best fit a given model to
experimental data. Adopting a Bayesian approach allows for prior beliefs about
uncertain model inputs to be conditioned on experimental data to determine a
posterior distribution, but probing this distribution using sampling techniques
such as Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be incredibly computationally
intensive. This difficulty is especially true for forward models consisting of
time-dependent partial differential equations. We pose the problem of
determining the thermal conductivity of a material via the laser flash
experiment as a Bayesian inverse problem in which the laser intensity is also
treated as uncertain. We introduce a parametric surrogate model that takes the
form of a stochastic Galerkin finite element approximation, also known as a
generalized polynomial chaos expansion, and show how it can be used to sample
efficiently from the approximate posterior distribution. This approach gives
access not only to the sought-after estimate of the thermal conductivity but
also important information about its relationship to the laser intensity, and
information for uncertainty quantification. We also investigate the effects of
the spatial profile of the laser on the estimated posterior distribution for
the thermal conductivity.

We showed that the COMPASS force field allows to describe with good accuracy
the frequency spectrum of atomic vibrations of graphane and fluorographene

the other hand, the force field doesn't describe very well the frequency
spectrum of graphene sheet, whose planar hexagonal lattice is formed by sp2
banding. In that case the frequency spectrum of out-of-plane vibrations differs
greatly from the experimental data - bending stiffness of a graphene sheet is
strongly over estimated. We present the correction of parameters of

achieve the coincidence of vibration frequency with experimental data. After
such corrections the COMPASS force field can be used to describe the dynamics

constrains on Higgs total width in the $\kappa$-framework and greatly improves
the constraints in the EFT framework as a distinct production mode other than

place at the classical level from the global fitting procedure where the $ZH$
process is the dominant background with its cross section around six times
larger than the $WW$-fusion signal. Despite that $ZH$ process can be measured
to great precision at future lepton colliders, failing take this interplay in
the coupling extraction will result in a 100\% too aggressive constraints on
$\kappa_W$, the Higgs coupling to $W$-boson pairs. This effect will also be

  have changed slightly",,"10.3390/e21090848",,"physics.pop-ph math.HO quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Probability theory as a physical theory is, in a sense, the most general
physics theory available, more encompassing than relativity theory and quantum
mechanics, which comply with probability theory. Taking this simple fact
seriously, I argue that probability theory points towards superdeterminism, a
principle that underlies, notably, 't Hooft's Cellular Automaton Interpretation
of quantum mechanics. Specifically, I argue that superdeterminism offers a
solution for 1) Kolmogorov's problem of probabilistic dependence; 2) the
interpretation of the Central Limit Theorem; and 3) Bell's theorem.
Superdeterminism's competitor, indeterminism ('no hidden variables'), remains
entirely silent regarding 1) and 2), and leaves 3) as an obstacle rather than a
solution for the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity. This
suggests that, if one wishes to stick to the standard position in physics and
adopt the principles with the highest explanatory power, one should adopt
superdeterminism and reject indeterminism. Throughout the article precise
questions to mathematicians are formulated to advance this research.

we show that the continuum limit of the preconditioned mass modified Langevin

the finite-dimensional counterpart has a dimension-independent convergence
rate. In addition, the preconditioning techniques can be naturally applied to
the multi-level quantum systems in the nonadiabatic regime, which are
compatible with various numerical approaches.

it frequently returns to the same tree topology. An alternative strategy would
be to explore tree space systematically, and never return to the same topology.
In this paper, we present an efficient parallelized method to map out the high
likelihood set of phylogenetic tree topologies via systematic search, which we
show to be a good approximation of the high posterior set of tree topologies.
Here `likelihood' of a topology refers to the tree likelihood for the
corresponding tree with optimized branch lengths. We call this method
`phylogenetic topographer' (PT). The PT strategy is very simple: starting in a
number of local topology maxima (obtained by hill-climbing from random starting
points), explore out using local topology rearrangements, only continuing
through topologies that are better than than some likelihood threshold below
the best observed topology. We show that the normalized topology likelihoods
are a useful proxy for the Bayesian posterior probability of those topologies.
By using a non-blocking hash table keyed on unique representations of tree
topologies, we avoid visiting topologies more than once across all concurrent
threads exploring tree space. We demonstrate that PT can be used directly to
approximate a Bayesian consensus tree topology. When combined with an accurate
means of evaluating per-topology marginal likelihoods, PT gives an alternative
procedure for obtaining Bayesian posterior distributions on phylogenetic tree
topologies.

referred to as a (generalized) shot noise or a filtered Poisson process. In
this contribution, we present a systematic study of a novel deconvolution
method to estimate the arrival times and amplitudes of the pulses from
realizations of such processes. The method shows that time-series can be
reconstructed for various pulse amplitude and waiting time distributions.
Despite a constraint on positive-definite amplitudes, it is shown that negative
amplitudes may also be reconstructed by flipping the sign of the time series.
The method performs well under moderate amounts of additive noise, both white
noise and colored noise having the same correlation function as the process
itself. The estimation of pulse shapes from the power spectrum is accurate
except for excessively broad waiting time distributions. Although the method
assumes constant pulse durations, it performs well under narrowly distributed
pulse durations. The most important constraint on the reconstruction is
information-loss, which limits the method to intermittent processes. The ratio
between the sampling time and the average waiting time between pulses must be
about 1/20 or smaller for a well sampled signal. Finally, given the system
forcing, the average pulse function may be recovered. This recovery is only
weakly constrained by the intermittency of the process.

opposed to some other ""problems"" that are sometimes described using similar
vocabulary. We then notice, following Tom Banks, that the problems become less
compelling once we recognize that the Universe contains quantum gravity, and
thus isn't fundamentally described by bulk QFT. Embracing this ""solution""
requires a reversal of the standard arrows UV->IR and past->future. The first
reversal is familiar from AdS/CFT. The second reversal refers more specifically
to our Universe's cosmology, and is clearly in potential conflict with the
Second Law of Thermodynamics. In the final part of the essay, we attempt to
defuse this conflict, suggesting that the Second Law can arise naturally from
de Sitter boundary conditions at future infinity.

defined by periods of relative stability followed by an abrupt decrease in

management and for avoiding irreversible vision loss. Based on this, we present
a unified statistical modeling framework that permits prediction of the timing

regarding disease progression. The developed method incorporates anatomical
information to create a biologically plausible data-generating model. We
accomplish this by introducing a spatially varying coefficients model that
includes spatially varying change points to detect structural shifts in both
the mean and variance process of VF data across both space and time. The VF
location-specific change point represents the underlying, and potentially
censored, timing of true change in disease trajectory while a multivariate
spatial boundary detection structure is introduced that accounts for the
complex spatial connectivity of the VF and optic disc. We show that our method
improves estimation and prediction of multiple aspects of disease management in

significant continuity improvement of the OFDM signal and its higher-order

the HDO is large. Furthermore, it was shown in the error performance analysis

orbits of geometrically finite subgroups do not necessarily equidistribute on
the whole boundary of hyperbolic space. But rather, they may equidistribute on

a mean value for the velocity ratio V/Vc=0.75, and found that rotation axes are
probably randomly distributed in the sky. Disk sizes in the line component
model are in the range of 2-13 stellar radii and do not correlate with the
effective temperature or spectral type. However, we found that the maximum size
of a stable disk correlates with the rotation velocity at the inner part of the
disk and the stellar mass. We found that, on average, the Be stars of our
combined sample do not rotate at their critical velocity. However, the
centrifugal force and mass of the star defines an upper limit size for a stable
disk configuration. For a given rotation, high-mass Be stars tend to have more
compact disks than their low-mass counterparts. It would be interesting to
follow up the evolution of the disk size in variable stars to better understand
the formation and dissipation processes of their circumstellar disks.

practical in real scenarios. Most of the deep learning methods use CNNs to
process each decoded frame in a video stream individually. However, the free of
charge yet valuable motion information already embedded in the video
compression format is usually overlooked. In this paper, we propose a fast
object detection method by taking advantage of this with a novel Motion aided
Memory Network (MMNet). The MMNet has two major advantages: 1) It significantly
accelerates the procedure of feature extraction for compressed videos. It only
need to run a complete recognition network for I-frames, i.e. a few reference
frames in a video, and it produces the features for the following P frames
(predictive frames) with a light weight memory network, which runs fast; 2)
Unlike existing methods that establish an additional network to model motion of
frames, we take full advantage of both motion vectors and residual errors that
are freely available in video streams. To our best knowledge, the MMNet is the
first work that investigates a deep convolutional detector on compressed
videos. Our method is evaluated on the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset, and
the results show that it is 3x times faster than single image detector R-FCN
and 10x times faster than high-performance detector MANet at a minor accuracy
loss.

massive galaxies with and without a model for AGN feedback. Differences in
stellar population and kinematic properties are evaluated by constructing mock
integral field unit (IFU) maps. The impact of the AGN is weak at high redshift
when all systems are mostly fast-rotating and disc-like. After $z \sim 1$ the
AGN simulations result in lower mass, older, less metal rich and slower
rotating systems with less disky isophotes - in general agreement with
observations. Two-dimensional kinematic maps of in-situ and accreted stars show
that these differences result from reduced in-situ star formation due to AGN
feedback. A full analysis of stellar orbits indicates that galaxies simulated
with AGN are typically more triaxial and have higher fractions of x-tubes and
box orbits and lower fractions of z-tubes. This trend can also be explained by
reduced late in-situ star formation. We introduce a global parameter, $\xi_3$ ,
to characterise the anti-correlation between the third-order kinematic moment
$h_3$ and the line-of-sight velocity ($v_{los}/{\sigma}$), and compare to
ATLAS$^{3D}$ observations. The kinematic asymmetry parameter $\xi_3$ might be a
useful diagnostic for large integral field surveys as it is a kinematic

to learn new concepts; conversely, human learning often requires few
examples--sometimes only one--from which the learner can abstract structural
concepts. We present a novel approach to introducing new spatial structures to
an AI agent, combining deep learning over qualitative spatial relations with
various heuristic search algorithms. The agent extracts spatial relations from
a sparse set of noisy examples of block-based structures, and trains
convolutional and sequential models of those relation sets. To create novel
examples of similar structures, the agent begins placing blocks on a virtual
table, uses a CNN to predict the most similar complete example structure after
each placement, an LSTM to predict the most likely set of remaining moves
needed to complete it, and recommends one using heuristic search. We verify
that the agent learned the concept by observing its virtual block-building
activities, wherein it ranks each potential subsequent action toward building
its learned concept. We empirically assess this approach with human
participants' ratings of the block structures. Initial results and qualitative
evaluations of structures generated by the trained agent show where it has
generalized concepts from the training data, which heuristics perform best
within the search space, and how we might improve learning and execution.

classes of nonlocal $t$-player games. Our motivating question is whether there
is a family of $t$-player XOR games for which the entangled bias is $1$ but for
which the classical bias goes down to $0$, for fixed $t$. Answering this
question would have important consequences in the study of multi-party
communication complexity, as a positive answer would imply an unbounded
separation between randomized communication complexity with and without
entanglement. Our contribution to answering the question is identifying several
general classes of games for which the classical bias can not go to zero when
the entangled bias stays above a constant threshold. This rules out the
possibility of using these games to answer our motivating question. A
previously studied set of XOR games, known not to give a positive answer to the
question, are those for which there is a quantum strategy that attains value 1
using a so-called Schmidt state. We generalize this class to mod-$m$ games and
show that their classical value is always at least $\frac{1}{m} + \frac{m-1}{m}
t^{1-t}$. Secondly, for free XOR games, in which the input distribution is of
product form, we show $\beta(G) \geq \beta^*(G)^{2^t}$ where $\beta(G)$ and
$\beta^*(G)$ are the classical and entangled biases of the game respectively.
We also introduce so-called line games, an example of which is a slight
modification of the Magic Square game, and show that they can not give a
positive answer to the question either. Finally we look at two-player unique
games and show that if the entangled value is $1-\epsilon$ then the classical
value is at least $1-\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\epsilon \log k})$ where $k$ is the
number of outputs in the game. Our proofs use semidefinite-programming
techniques, the Gowers inverse theorem and hypergraph norms.

ratio of 10 were considered in this study. The effects of buoyancy, asymmetry,
jet densities and Reynolds numbers on the resulting flow structure were studied
in both vertical and horizontal orientations. Significant discrepancies were
found between the evolution of current realistic jets issuing from curved
surfaces and those conventional high-aspect-ratio jets originating from flat
surfaces. These realistic pipeline leak-representative jets were found to
deflect along the jet streamwise axis. It was found that increases in aspect
ratio caused a reduction in the angle of deflection, jet centreline decay rates
and the width growth on both velocity and scalar fields compared to their
non-planar round jet counterparts, most notably in the far field.

stiffness feedback in a latency-prone centralized control process.
Additionally, series elastic actuators (SEAs) are becoming prevalent in
torque-controlled robots during recent years to achieve compliant interactions
with environments and humans. However, designing optimal impedance controllers
and characterizing impedance performance for SEAs with time delays and
filtering are still under-explored problems. The presented study addresses the
optimal controller design problem by devising a critically-damped gain design
method for a class of SEA cascaded control architectures, which is composed of
outer-impedance and inner-torque feedback loops. Via the proposed controller
design criterion, we adopt frequency-domain methods to thoroughly analyze the
effects of time delays, filtering and load inertia on SEA impedance
performance. These results are further validated through the analysis,

magnitude greater than the travelling speed of hydraulic information (volume
fractions.) Dynamically simulating such flows requires resolution of acoustic
and hydraulic waves existing at vastly different spatial and temporal scales.
If simulated on the same numerical grid, the need for accuracy in hydraulic
waves will necessitate an exaggerated resolution of acoustic waves. Likewise,
time steps restricted by the speed of sound are small compared to the time
scales active in hydraulic waves. This constitutes a waste of computational
potential. The method proposed herein decouples the hydraulic and acoustic
scales, greatly improving computational efficiency.
  The proposed dual grid method solves a four-equation compressible two-fluid
model on a principal grid which robustly accounts for the pressure evolution
and conserves mass and momentum. An incompressible two-equation model is at the
same time solved on a finer grid, resolving the details of the hydraulic
evolution. Information from both model formulations is coupled through the
terms of the governing transport equations, providing consistency between the
grids. Accurate and finely resolved schemes can then be employed for the
incompressible two-fluid model without suffering from the time and stability
restrictions otherwise enforced by acoustic waves. At the same time, the Hybrid
Central-Upwind flux splitting scheme of Evje and Fl{\aa}tten (2005a) allows for
an explicit and numerically robust treatment of the acoustic waves without
losing hydraulic accuracy.
  The dual grid method is tested against four dissimilar problems. In all
problems, the proposed scheme provided significant increases in computational
efficiency and accuracy as compared with a single grid arrangement.

two-phase pipe flow simulations for obtaining non-dissipative flow predictions.
A Roe scheme and several methods based on the principle of characteristics are
presented for the two-fluid model. The main focus is finding numerically
efficient ways of capturing wave dynamics and flow regime transitions through
direct simulation. Characteristic methods offer the possibility of simulating
hyperbolic systems without numerical dissipation. These methods do however lack
certain fundamental conservation properties. Challenges related to information
scattering and clustering in space and time, particularly around shocks, are
also an issue in some method variants. Hybridisations with the finite volume
method are proposed which overcome these shortcomings. All methods are
compared, evaluating predictions on the onset of linear wave growth and
simulations of non-linear, discontinuous roll-waves. The following observations
are made: 1. Characteristic methods are excellent at predicting the onset of
linear hydrodynamic instability, even with a small number of computational
nodes. 2. Dissipative errors in finite volume methods and characteristic
hybrids will be closely linked to the Courant number. The Roe scheme and the
characteristic hybrids give very little dissipation error as the Courant number
approaches unity. This then becomes a question of numerical stability. 3.
Adapting dynamic grid cells, moving along with the characteristics information
drift, greatly improves simulation efficiency by allowing for longer time
steps. Dynamic grid cells are also useful for alleviating the need for
interpolation in characteristic methods. These methods easily out-perform the
more basic upwind and Lax-Friedrich schemes.

was the existence of plane-filling curves. As is well known, the first example
of such a curve was given by the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano in 1890.
Subsequently, other examples of plane-filling curves appeared, with some of
them having $n$-dimensional analogues. However, the expressions of the
coordinates of the Peano curve are not easily extendable to arbitrary $n$
dimensions. In fact, the only known extension of the Peano curve to an
$n$-dimensional space-filling curve, made by Stephen Milne in 1982, is rather
geometric and makes it difficult to establish basic properties of these curves,
as continuity and nowhere differentiability, as well as more advanced
properties, as uniform distribution of the coordinate functions. Here, we will
introduce in a completely analytical way the $n$-dimensional version of the
Peano curve. More precisely, for a given integer $n\ge 2,$ we will define (by
means of identities) the $n$ coordinate functions of a continuous and
surjective map from a closed interval to the unit $n$-dimensional cube of
$\mathbb{R}^n,$ which, for the particular case $n=2,$ agrees with the original
Peano curve. With this description, as we shall see, one can easily establish
all the properties we mentioned above, and also calculate the Hausdorff
dimension of the graphs of the coordinate functions of this curve.

hypothesis that tides may be triggering seismic activity in these regions and
extend the analysis to two other seismic clusters in northern-central South
America, specifically in the areas of El Puyo (Ecuador) and Pucallpa (Peru).
For this purpose, we use the available focal mechanism information for seismic
events at these locations, and calculate for each event the Tidal Coulomb
Failure Stress (TCFS) as obtained from estimations of the tidal strain tensor.
Tidal strains are computed considering the Earth body tides and the effect of
the ocean tidal loading. Since our purpose is to elucidate the role of tides in
earthquake nucleation, calculations of the TCFS are conducted not only for the
time of earthquake, but also for the time of the closest maximum strain within
a window of a few hours before the events. Our results tend to support the
hypothesis that tidal stresses are contributing to earthquake generation in all
the studied areas; this trend is especially stronger when TCFS are calculated
at pre-earthquake times. The physical explanation for the positive contribution
of tides to earthquake triggering in intermediate depth clusters may lie in the
fact that a wide diversity of fault plane orientations is possible within a
relatively small volume of subducted lithosphere, so making the tides more
likely to help loosening up the blocks at the fault plane to promote slip.

the problem. In this work, we propose a novel method for constraining the

that the environment of the source domain is known (e.g. synthetically
generated), and we propose to explicitly enforce preservation of the
ground-truth labels on the translated images.
  We experiment on preserving ground-truth information such as semantic
segmentation, disparity, and instance segmentation. We show significant
evidence that our method achieves improved performance over the
state-of-the-art model of UNIT for translating images from SYNTHIA to
Cityscapes. The generated images are perceived as more realistic in human
surveys and outperforms UNIT when used in a domain adaptation scenario for
semantic segmentation.

gravitation and electromagnetism may be unified using a degenerate metric.
There are four fields (in the four-dimensional sense): a tensor field, two
vector fields and a scalar field, and they are unified with a combination of a
gauge-like invariance and a reflection symmetry which means that both vector
fields are photons. The gauge-like invariance implies that the fifth dimension
is not directly observable; it also implies that charge is a constant of
motion. The scalar field is analogous to the Brans-Dicke scalar field, and the
theory tends towards the Einstein-Maxwell theory in the limit as the coupling
constant tends to infinity. As there is some scope for fields to vary in the
fifth dimension it is possible for the photons to have wave behaviour in the
fifth dimension. The wave behaviour has two effects: it gives the photons mass,
and it prevents them from interacting directly with normal matter. These
massive photons still act as a source of gravity, however, and therefore they
are candidates for dark matter.

reformulation of the local equations of the mechanical problem in a geometric
functional setting. This relies on the definition of Hilbert spaces of
kinematically and statically admissible tensor fields, whose orthogonality and
duality properties are recalled. These are endowed with specific energetic
scalar products that make use of a reference and uniform elasticity tensor. The
corresponding strain and stress Green's operators are introduced and
interpreted as orthogonal projection operators in the admissibility spaces. In
this context and as an alternative to classical minimum energy principles, two
geometric variational principles are investigated with the introduction of
functionals that aim at measuring the discrepancy of arbitrary test fields to
the kinematic, static or material admissibility conditions of the problem. By
relaxing the corresponding local equations, this study aims in particular at
laying the groundwork for the homogenization of composites whose constitutive
properties are only partially known or uncertain. The local fields in the
composite and their macroscopic responses are computed through the minimization
of the proposed geometric functionals. To do so, their gradients are computed
using the Green's operators and gradient-based optimization schemes are
discussed. A FFT-based implementation of these schemes is proposed and they are
assessed numerically on a canonical example for which analytical solutions are
available.

heterogeneous distributions of isotropic elastic moduli from full strain field
data. This parameter identification problem exposes the need for a local
reconstruction procedure that is investigated here in the case of materials
with small contrast. To begin with the integral formulation framework for the
periodic linear elasticity problem, first- and second-order asymptotics are
retained for the strain field solution and the effective elasticity tensor.
Properties of the featured Green's tensor are investigated to characterize its
decomposition into an isotropic term and an orthogonal part. The former is then
shown to define a local contribution to the volume integral equations
considered. Based on this property, then the combination of multiple strain
field solutions corresponding to well-chosen applied macroscopic strains is
shown to lead to a set of local and uncoupled identities relating,
respectively, the bulk and shear moduli to the spherical and deviatoric
components of the strain fields. Valid at the first-order in the weak contrast
limit, such relations permit point-wise conversions of strain maps into
elasticity maps. Furthermore, it is also shown that for macroscopically
isotropic material configurations a single strain field solution is actually
sufficient to reconstruct either the bulk or the shear modulus distribution.
Those results are then revisited in the case of bounded media. Finally, some
sets of analytical and numerical examples are provided for comparison and to
illustrate the relevance of the obtained strain-modulus local equations for a
parameter identification method based on full-field data.

People's Republic of China (PRC) from the Union. The crisis stemmed from the
admission by the IAU, amidst strong protest from PRC and some other member
countries, of the Republic of China (ROC) to the Union, creating the so-called
`\textit{Two Chinas}' -- or `\textit{One China, one Taiwan}' problem. The
crisis directly led to the absence of mainland Chinese astronomers from the
stage of international collaborations and exchanges, and was only solved two
decades later. The solution, accepted by all the parties involved, is that
China is to have two adhering organizations, with mainland China astronomers
represented by the Chinese Astronomical Society located in Nanjing (China
Nanjing) and China Taiwan astronomers represented by the Academia Sinica
located in Taipei (China Taipei). The denominations `\textit{China Nanjing}'
and `\textit{China Taipei}' represent the IAU official resolution and should be
used in all IAU events.
  The China crisis, probably the most serious one in IAU history, was a painful
lesson in the 100-year development of the Union. Yet, with its eventual
solution, the Union has emerged stronger, upholding its spirit of promoting
astronomical development through international collaboration of astronomers
from all regions and countries, regardless of the political systems, religion,
ethnicity, gender or level of astronomical development.

the stability in authentication when the users rotate in their positions. This
is due to a significant change in CSI when a user rotates which mislead the
authenticator when it compares the new CSI with the previous ones. Our approach
presents a way of extracting features from raw CSI measurements which are
stable towards rotation. We extract these features by the means of a deep
neural network. We also present a scenario in which users can be {efficiently}

experimental results are presented to show the performance of the proposed

programming (GP) framework for convolutional neural network architecture

terminals) are selected residual blocks and non-leaf nodes (GP functions)
specify the block assembling procedure. Our tree-based representation enables
easy design and flexible implementation of genetic operators. Specifically, we
design a dynamic crossover operator that strikes a balance between exploration
and exploitation, which emphasizes CNN complexity at early stage and CNN
diversity at later stage. Therefore, the desired CNN architecture with balanced
depth and width can be found within limited trials. Moreover, our GP-CNAS
framework is highly compatible with other manually-designed and NAS-generated
block types as well. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset show that
GP-CNAS is competitive among the state-of-the-art automatic and semi-automatic
