connected by a partially deconfined phase (i.e. SU(M) in SU(N), where M<N, is
deconfined), which can be stable or unstable depending on the details of the
theory. When this phase is unstable, it is the gauge theory counterpart of the
small black hole phase in the dual string theory. Partial deconfinement is
closely related to the Gross-Witten-Wadia transition, and is likely to be
relevant to the QCD phase transition.
  The mechanism of partial deconfinement is related to a generic property of a
class of systems. As an instructive example, we demonstrate the similarity
between the Yang-Mills theory/string theory and a mathematical model of the
collective behavior of ants [Beekman et al., Proceedings of the National

a fundamental quantity to understand our Universe. The fragmentation of diffuse
molecular cloud into stars is subject to physical processes such as gravity,
turbulence, thermal pressure, and magnetic field. The final mass of a star is
believed to be a combined outcome of a virially unstable reservoir and
subsequent accretion. We aim to clarify the roles of different supporting
energies, notably the thermal pressure and the magnetic field, in determining
the stellar mass. Following previous studies by Lee & Hennebelle (2018a,b), we
perform a series of numerical experiments of stellar cluster formation inside
an isolated molecular clump. By changing the effective equation of state (EOS)
of the diffuse gas (that is to say gas whose density is below the critical
density at which dust becomes opaque to its radiation) and the strength of the
magnetic field, we investigate whether any characteristic mass is introduced
into the fragmentation processes. The EOS of the diffuse gas, including the
bulk temperature and the polytropic index, does not affect significantly the
shape of the stellar mass spectrum. The presence of magnetic field slightly
modifies the shape of the mass spectrum only when extreme values are applied.
This study confirms that the peak of the IMF is primarily determined by the
adiabatic high-density end of the EOS that mimics the radiation inside the
high-density gas. Furthermore, the shape of the mass spectrum is mostly
sensitive to the density PDF, and the magnetic field has likely only a
secondary role. In particular, we stress that the Jeans mass at the mean cloud
density and at the critical density are not responsible of setting the peak.

measures known as the non-linear filter (belief) process. Establishing
sufficient conditions for the weak Feller property for such processes is a

field can operate as a variety of nanoelectronic devices, such as tunable
tunnel diodes with current-voltage characteristics controlled by the transverse
field. Using the density-functional tight-binding method to address the effects
of mechanical strain induced by the twisting, we show that the electronic
transport properties remain almost unaffected by the strain in relevant cases
and propose a simplified tight-binding model which gives reliable results. The
transverse electric field creates a periodic electrostatic potential along the
nanoribbon, resulting in a formation of a superlattice-like energy band
structure and giving rise to different remarkable electronic properties. We
demonstrate that if the nanoribbon geometry and operating point are selected
appropriately, the system can function as a field-effect transistor or a device
with nonlinear current-voltage characteristic manifesting one or several
regions of negative differential resistance. The latter opens possibilities for
applications such as an active element of nanoscale amplifiers, generators, and
new class of devices with multiple logic states.

forecasting because most of the time series data are nonlinear in nature and
highly dynamic in behaviour. The time series forecasting has a great impact on
our socio-economic environment. Hence, to deal with these challenges its need
to be redefined the DNN model and keeping this in mind, data pre-processing,
network architecture and network parameters are need to be consider before
feeding the data into DNN models. Data normalization is the basic data
pre-processing technique form which learning is to be done. The effectiveness
of time series forecasting is heavily depend on the data normalization
technique. In this paper, different normalization methods are used on time
series data before feeding the data into the DNN model and we try to find out
the impact of each normalization technique on DNN to forecast the time series.

conserved CP symmetry can also stabilize DM candidates, provided it is a CP
symmetry of order higher than two. CP4 3HDM, the three-Higgs-doublet model with
CP symmetry of order 4, is the simplest example of this kind. It contains two
mass-degenerate scalar DM candidates $\varphi$ and $\bar\varphi$, each of them
being a CP4 eigenstate and, therefore, its own antiparticle. A novel
phenomenological feature of this model is the presence of $\varphi\varphi

It offers a rare example of DM models in which self-interaction in the dark

Here, we explore the thermal evolution of these DM species in the asymmetric

imbalance of the densities of $\varphi$ and $\bar\varphi$. As the Universe
cools down, we track the evolution of the asymmetry through different stages,

present a detailed qualitative description of the process, and then corroborate
it with numerical results obtained using a dedicated computer code. Finally, we

potential energy released by radiatively efficient accretion of matter onto a
BH in this mass range is expected to be emitted in the extreme UV-ultrasoft
X-ray bands. We demonstrate that such a 'miniquasar' at $z\sim 15$ should leave
a specific, localized imprint on the 21 cm cosmological signal. Namely, its
position on the sky will be surrounded by a region with a fairly sharp boundary
of several arcmin radius, within which the 21 cm brightness temperature quickly
grows inwards from the background value of $\sim -200$ mK to $\sim +30$ mK. The
size of this region is only weakly sensitive to the BH mass, so that the flux
density of the excess 21 cm signal is expected to take a nearly universal value
of $\sim 0.2[(1+z)/16]^{-2}$~mJy and should be detectable by the Square
Kilometer Array. We argue that an optimal strategy would be to search for such
signals from high-$z$ miniquasar candidates that can be found and localized
with a next-generation X-ray mission such as Lynx. A detection of the predicted
21 cm signal would provide a measurement of the growing BH's redshift to within

the lens spaces and a single other Seifert fibered space. Furthermore, we show
that all remaining orientable Seifert fibered spaces over the 2-sphere or a

networking services across multiple NFV/SDN network domains by implementing the
so-called Service Function Chain (SFC) i.e., a sequence of Virtual Network
Functions (VNF) that composes the service, is a challenging task. In this paper
we address two crucial sub-problems of this task: i) the language to formalize
the request of a given SFC to the network and ii) the solution of the SFC
design problem, once the request is received. As for i) in our solution the
request is built upon the intent-based approach, with a syntax that focuses on
asking the user ""what"" she needs and not ""how"" it should be implemented, in a
simple and high level language. Concerning ii) we define a formal model
describing network architectures and VNF properties that is then used to solve
the SFC design problem by means of Constraint Programming (CP), a programming
paradigm which is often used in Artificial Intelligence applications. We argue
that CP can be effectively used to address this kind of problems because it
provides very expressive and flexible modeling languages which come with
powerful solvers, thus providing efficient and scalable performance. We
substantiate this claim by validating our tool on some typical and non trivial

  Estimation using Moment Evolutions",,,,,"math.ST cs.CV stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modelling deformation of anatomical objects observed in medical images can
help describe disease progression patterns and variations in anatomy across
populations. We apply a stochastic generalisation of the Large Deformation
Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework to model differences in the
evolution of anatomical objects detected in populations of image data. The
computational challenges that are prevalent even in the deterministic LDDMM
setting are handled by extending the FLASH LDDMM representation to the
stochastic setting keeping a finite discretisation of the infinite dimensional
space of image deformations. In this computationally efficient setting, we
perform estimation to infer parameters for noise correlations and local
variability in datasets of images. Fundamental for the optimisation procedure
is using the finite dimensional Fourier representation to derive approximations
of the evolution of moments for the stochastic warps. Particularly, the first
moment allows us to infer deformation mean trajectories. The second moment
encodes variation around the mean, and thus provides information on the noise
correlation. We show on simulated datasets of 2D MR brain images that the
estimation algorithm can successfully recover parameters of the stochastic
model.

  in Long Videos","CVPR 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a new model to determine relative skill from long videos, through
learnable temporal attention modules. Skill determination is formulated as a
ranking problem, making it suitable for common and generic tasks. However, for
long videos, parts of the video are irrelevant for assessing skill, and there
may be variability in the skill exhibited throughout a video. We therefore
propose a method which assesses the relative overall level of skill in a long
video by attending to its skill-relevant parts. Our approach trains temporal
attention modules, learned with only video-level supervision, using a novel
rank-aware loss function. In addition to attending to task relevant video
parts, our proposed loss jointly trains two attention modules to separately
attend to video parts which are indicative of higher (pros) and lower (cons)
skill. We evaluate our approach on the EPIC-Skills dataset and additionally
annotate a larger dataset from YouTube videos for skill determination with five
previously unexplored tasks. Our method outperforms previous approaches and
classic softmax attention on both datasets by over 4% pairwise accuracy, and as
much as 12% on individual tasks. We also demonstrate our model's ability to
attend to rank-aware parts of the video.

nonnegative linearization of products, i.e., the product of any two
$P_m(x),P_n(x)$ is a conical combination of the polynomials
$P_{|m-n|}(x),\ldots,P_{m+n}(x)$. Since the coefficients in the arising
expansions are often of cumbersome structure or not explicitly available, such
considerations are generally very nontrivial. In 1970, G. Gasper was able to
determine the set $V$ of all pairs $(\alpha,\beta)\in(-1,\infty)^2$ for which
the corresponding Jacobi polynomials
$(R_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x))_{n\in\mathbb{N}_0}$, normalized by
$R_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(1)\equiv1$, satisfy nonnegative linearization of

transformations of the Jacobi polynomials and orthogonal w.r.t. the measure

we give the solution and show that
$(T_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x))_{n\in\mathbb{N}_0}$ satisfies nonnegative

diagrams of young and intermediate age (less than about 2 Gyr) massive star
clusters, where the MS turn-off is broader than can be explained by photometric
uncertainties, crowding, or binarity. Rotation is suspected to be the cause of
this feature, by accumulating fast rotating stars, strongly affected by gravity
darkening and rotation-induced mixing, near the MS turn-off. This scenario
successfully reproduces the tight relation between the age and the actual
extent in luminosity of the extended MS turn-off of observed clusters. Below a
given mass (dependent on the metallicity), stars are efficiently braked early
on the MS due to the interaction of stellar winds and the surface magnetic
field, making their tracks converge towards those of non-rotating tracks in the
HRD. When these stars are located at the turn-off of a cluster, their slow
rotation causes the extended MS turn-off feature to disappear. We investigate
the maximal mass for which this braking occurs at different metallicities, and
determine the age above which no extended MS turn-off is expected in clusters.
Our models predict that the extended MS turn-off phenomenon disappears at ages
older than about 2 Gyr. There is a trend with the metallicity, the age at which
the disappearance occurs becoming older at higher metallicity. These results
are robust between the two codes used in this work, despite some differences in
the input physics and in particular in the detailed description of
rotation-induced internal processes and of angular momentum extraction by
stellar winds. Comparing our results with clusters in the LMC and Galaxy shows
a very good fit to the observations. This strengthens the rotation scenario to
explain the cause of the extended MS turn-off phenomenon.

implications to its users. A lot of consumer IoT devices have little to no
security implementation at all, thus risking user's privacy and making them
target of mass cyber-attacks. Indeed, recent outbreak of Mirai botnet and its
variants have already proved the lack of security on the IoT world. Hence, it
is important to understand the security issues and attack vectors in the IoT
domain. Though significant research has been done to secure traditional
computing systems, little focus was given to the IoT realm. In this work, we
reduce this gap by developing a honeypot framework for IoT devices.
Specifically, we introduce U-PoT: a novel honeypot framework for capturing
attacks on IoT devices that use Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol. A
myriad of smart home devices including smart switches, smart bulbs,
surveillance cameras, smart hubs, etc. uses the UPnP protocol. Indeed, a simple
search on Shodan IoT search engine lists 1,676,591 UPnP devices that are
exposed to public network. The popularity and ubiquitous nature of UPnP-based
IoT device necessitates a full-fledged IoT honeypot system for UPnP devices.
Our novel framework automatically creates a honeypot from UPnP device
description documents and is extendable to any device types or vendors that use
UPnP for communication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
towards a flexible and configurable honeypot framework for UPnP-based IoT
devices. We released U-PoT under an open source license for further research
and created a database of UPnP device descriptions. We also evaluated our
framework on two emulated deices. Our experiments show that the emulated
devices are able to mimic the behavior of a real IoT device and trick
vendor-provided device management applications or popular IoT search engines
while having minimal performance ovherhead.

male-dominated, female developers encountering various negative workplace
experiences reported feeling like they ""do not belong"". Exposures to
discriminatory expletives or negative critiques from their male colleagues may
further exacerbate those feelings. Aims: The primary goal of this study is to
identify the differences in expressions of sentiments between male and female
developers during various software engineering tasks. Method: On this goal, we
mined the code review repositories of six popular open source projects. We used
a semi-automated approach leveraging the name as well as multiple social
networks to identify the gender of a developer. Using SentiSE, a customized and
state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool for the software engineering domain,
we classify each communication as negative, positive, or neutral. We also
compute the frequencies of sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives used by
each developer. Results: Our results suggest that the likelihood of using
sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives during code reviews varies based on
the gender of a developer, as females are significantly less likely to express
sentiments than males. Although female developers were more neutral to their
male colleagues than to another female, male developers from three out of the
six projects were not only writing more frequent negative comments but also
withholding positive encouragements from their female counterparts. Conclusion:
Our results provide empirical evidence of another factor behind the negative
work place experiences encountered by the female developers that may be
contributing to the diminishing number of females in the SE industry.

further requires that each coded symbol is uniformly accessed when we decode

capacity of perfectly smooth LDCs, maximized over all code lengths $M$, is
$C^*=N\left(1+1/N+1/N^2+\cdots+1/N^{K-1}\right)^{-1}$. Furthermore, given $K,

employ a semi-analytical approach to study the spherical collapse of dark
matter haloes in symmetron gravity and provide insights into how the
phenomenology of splashback is affected. The symmetron is a scalar-tensor
theory of gravity which exhibits a screening mechanism whereby higher-density
regions are screened from the effects of a fifth force. In this model, we find
that, as over-densities grow over cosmic time, the inner region becomes heavily
screened. In particular, we identify a sector of the parameter space for which
material currently sitting at $r_\mathrm{sp}$ has followed, during the
collapse, the formation of this screened region. As a result, we find that for
this part of the parameter space the splashback radius is maximally affected by
the symmetron force and we predict changes in $r_\mathrm{sp}$ up to around
$10\%$ compared to its General Relativity value. Because this margin is within
the precision of present splashback experiments, we expect this feature to soon
provide constraints for symmetron gravity on previously unexplored scales.

into account the detection efficiency of the Kepler and radial velocity (RV)
surveys. The giant planet occurrence rates for Kepler and RV show the same
rising trend with increasing distance from the star. We identify a break in the
RV giant planet distribution between ~2-3 au -- close to the location of the
snow line in the Solar System -- after which the occurrence rate decreases with
distance from the star. Extrapolating a broken power-law distribution to larger
semi-major axes, we find good agreement with the ~ 1% planet occurrence rates
from direct imaging surveys. Assuming a symmetric power law, we also estimate
that the occurrence of giant planets between 0.1-100 au is 26.6 +7.5 -5.4% for
planets with masses 0.1-20MJ and decreases to 6.2 +1.5 -1.2% for planets more
massive than Jupiter. This implies that only a fraction of the structures

this paper looks to compare the application of the Theory of Functional
Connections (TFC) with one based on least-squares support vector machines
(LS-SVM). The TFC method uses a constrained expression, an expression that
always satisfies the DE constraints, which transforms the process of solving a
DE into solving an unconstrained optimization problem that is ultimately solved
via least-squares (LS). In addition to individual analysis, the two methods are
merged into a new methodology, called constrained SVMs (CSVM), by incorporating
the LS-SVM method into the TFC framework to solve unconstrained problems.
Numerical tests are conducted on four sample problems: One first order linear
ordinary differential equation (ODE), one first order nonlinear ODE, one second
order linear ODE, and one two-dimensional linear partial differential equation
(PDE). Using the LS-SVM method as a benchmark, a speed comparison is made for
all the problems by timing the training period, and an accuracy comparison is
made using the maximum error and mean squared error on the training and test
sets. In general, TFC is shown to be slightly faster (by an order of magnitude
or less) and more accurate (by multiple orders of magnitude) than the LS-SVM

of internal stress in its unloaded reference configuration. Developing a sound
mathematical framework to model initially stressed solids in nonlinear
elasticity is key for many applications in engineering and biology. This work
investigates the links between the existence of elastic minimizers and the
constitutive restrictions for initially stressed materials subjected to finite
deformations. In particular, we consider a subclass of constitutive responses
in which the strain energy density is taken as a scalar valued function of both
the deformation gradient and the initial stress tensor. The main advantage of
this approach is that the initial stress tensor belongs to the group of the
divergence-free symmetric tensors satisfying the boundary condition in any
given reference configuration. However, it is still unclear which physical
restrictions must be imposed for the well-posedness of this elastic problem.
Assuming that the constitutive response depends on the choice of the reference
configuration only through the initial stress tensor, under given conditions we
prove the local existence of a relaxed state given by an implicit tensor
function of the initial stress distribution. This tensor function is generally
not unique, and can be transformed accordingly to the symmetry group of the
material at fixed initial stresses. These results allow to extend Ball's
existence theorem of elastic minimizers for the proposed constitutive choice of
initially stressed materials.

hundreds of thousands of file downloads from multiple locations. We start by
examining an OCD baseline approach: traffic from a source A to a destination B
successively passes through two cloud virtual machines operating as relays -
nearest to A and B; and the two cloud relays employ TCP split.
  We show that even this naive strategy can outperform recently proposed
improved end-to-end congestion control paradigms (BBR and PCC) by an order of

identify where today's Internet data delivery mechanisms diverge from this

changing traffic demand patterns, limited planning time and various sources of

SURTRAC (Scalable URban TRAffic Control) is a recently developed traffic signal
control approach which computes delay-minimizing and coordinated (across
neighbouring traffic lights) schedules of oncoming vehicle clusters in real
time. To ensure real-time responsiveness in the presence of turn-induced
uncertainty, SURTRAC computes schedules which minimize the delay for the
expected turn movements as opposed to minimizing the expected delay under
turn-induced uncertainty. This approximation ensures real-time tractability,
but degrades solution quality in the presence of turn-induced uncertainty. To
address this limitation, we introduce TuSeRACT (Turn Sample based Real-time

traffic signal control. Unlike SURTRAC, TuSeRACT computes schedules that
minimize expected delay over sampled turn movements of observed traffic, and
communicates samples of traffic outflows to neighbouring intersections. We
formulate this sample-based scheduling problem as a constraint program and
empirically evaluate our approach on synthetic traffic networks. Our approach

annihilation being $s$-wave or $p$-wave. We point out that thermal dark matter
particles with non-negligible interactions with both electrons and neutrinos
are more elusive to CMB observations than purely electrophilic or
neutrinophilic ones. In addition, assisted by the accuracy of our approach, we
show that CMB Stage-IV experiments will generically test thermal dark matter

low-redshift galaxies from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog 2 (GSWLC-2). For
each galaxy we derive, using CIGALE and the SED+LIR fitting technique, the
slope of the dust attenuation curve and the strength of the UV bump, plus many
other galaxy parameters. We find that the IRX-beta scatter is driven entirely
by a wide range of attenuation curves - primarily their slopes. Once the slope
and the UV bump are fixed, the scatter in the IRX-beta vanishes. The question
of the IRX-beta scatter is the direct manifestation of a more fundamental
question of the diversity of dust attenuation curves. The predominant role of
the attenuation curve is the consequence of a narrow range of intrinsic UV
slopes of star-forming galaxies. Galaxies with different specific SFRs or
population ages do not show strong trends in the IRX-beta diagram because their
attenuation curves are, on average, similar. Similarly, there is no shift in
the IRX-beta locus between starbursts and normal star-forming galaxies, both
types having, on average, steep attenuation curves. Optical opacity is
identified as the strongest determinant of the attenuation curve slope, and
consequently the IRX-beta diversity. Despite the scatter, the use of an average
IRX-beta relation is justified to correct SFRs, adding a random error of <~0.15
dex. The form of the local correspondence between IRX-beta and attenuation
curves is maintained at high redshift as long as the evolution of the intrinsic
UV slopes stays within a few tenths.

metallicities, dust, black hole activity, and more. As a result, inferring
accurate physical parameters requires high-dimensional models which capture or
marginalize over this complexity. Here we re-assess inferences of galaxy
stellar masses and SFRs using the 14-parameter physical model
Prospector-$\alpha$ built in the Prospector Bayesian inference framework. We
fit the photometry of 58,461 galaxies from the 3D-HST catalogs at $0.5 < z <
2.5$. The resulting stellar masses are $\sim0.1-0.3$ dex larger than the
fiducial masses while remaining consistent with dynamical constraints. This
change is primarily due to the systematically older SFHs inferred with
Prospector. The SFRs are $\sim0.1-1+$ dex lower than UV+IR SFRs, with the
largest offsets caused by emission from ""old"" ($t>100$ Myr) stars. These new
inferences lower the observed cosmic star formation rate density by $\sim0.2$
dex and increase the observed stellar mass growth by $\sim 0.1$ dex, finally
bringing these two quantities into agreement and implying an older, more
quiescent Universe than found by previous studies at these redshifts. We
corroborate these results by showing that the Prospector-$\alpha$ SFHs are both
more physically realistic and are much better predictors of the evolution of
the stellar mass function. Finally, we highlight examples of observational data
which can break degeneracies in the current model; these observations can be
incorporated into priors in future models to produce new & more accurate
physical parameters.

with features indicative of jellyfish morphologies have been observed. In this
paper, we propose a hydrodynamic model for the merger as a whole, compatible
with its diffuse X-ray emission, and correlate the gas properties in this model
with the locations of the jellyfish galaxy candidates in the real system. We
find that jellyfish galaxies seem to be preferentially located near a boundary
inside each subcluster where diffuse gas moving along with the subcluster and
diffuse gas from the remainder of the system meet. The velocity change in those
boundaries is such that a factor of up to $\sim$1000 increase in the ram
pressure takes place within a few hundred kpc, which could trigger the high
rate of gas loss necessary for a jellyfish morphology to emerge. A theoretical
treatment of ram pressure stripping in the environment of galaxy cluster
mergers has not been presented in the literature so far; we propose that this
could be a common scenario for the formation of jellyfish morphologies in such
systems.

parameters such as the density threshold, $n$, to localize the star-forming
gas. In this work, we investigate the possibilities to utilize the observed
clustered nature of star formation (SF) in order to refine SF prescriptions and
constrain the density threshold parameter. To this end, we measure the
clustering strength, correlation length and power-law index of the two-point
correlation function of young ($\tau<50$ Myr) stellar particles and compare our
results to observations from the HST Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS).
Our simulations reveal a clear trend of larger clustering signal and power-law
index and lower correlation length as the SF threshold increases with only mild
dependence on galaxy properties such as stellar mass or specific star formation
rate. In conclusion, we find that the observed clustering of SF is inconsistent
with a low threshold for SF ($n<1$ cm$^{-3}$) and strongly favours a high value
for the density threshold of SF ($n>10$ cm$^{-3}$), as for example employed in
the NIHAO project.

Jupiters (HJs). In particular, Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations of orbital
eccentricity/inclination induced by a distant planetary or stellar companion,
combined with tidal friction, have been shown to produce HJs on Gyr timescales,
provided that efficient tidal dissipation operates in the planet. We re-examine
this scenario with the inclusion of dynamical tides. When the planet's orbit is
in a high-eccentricity phase, the tidal force from the star excites oscillatory
f-modes and r-modes in the planet. For sufficiently large eccentricity and
small pericentre distance, the mode can grow chaotically over multiple
pericentre passages and eventually dissipate non-linearly, drawing energy from
the orbit and rapidly shrinking the semi-major axis. We study the effect of
such chaotic tides on the planet's orbital evolution. We find that this pathway
produces very eccentric ($e\gtrsim 0.9$) warm Jupiters (WJs) on short
timescales (a few to 100 Myrs). These WJs efficiently circularize to become HJs
due to their persistently small pericentre distances. Chaotic tides can also
save some planets from tidal disruption by truncating the LK eccentricity
oscillations, significantly increasing the HJ formation fraction for a range of
planet masses and radii. Using a population synthesis calculation, we determine
the characteristics of WJs and HJs produced in this scenario, including the
final period distribution, orbital inclinations and stellar obliquities.
Chaotic tides endow LK migration with several favorable features to explain
observations of HJs. We expect that chaotic tides are also important in other
flavours of high-$e$ migration.

phase transitions, dubbed deconfined thermal transitions. Constructing a $Z_2$
lattice gauge model with strong interactions between $Z_2$ gauge fluxes, we
prove the existence of a thermal phase transition between deconfined and
confined phases in two spatial dimensions in sharp contrast to its absence in
the Wegner model. Incorporating deconfined fermions, it is shown that gapless
excitations from Fermi surfaces endow line-tension to $Z_2$ gauge fluxes at
zero temperature, and we argue that a deconfined thermal transition with
deconfined fermions may be interpreted as a hidden order transition with
thermal gap-opening in Fermi surfaces. Moreover, it is shown that symmetry
breaking transitions in deconfined phases may be unconventional. Global $Z_2$
and $U(1)$ symmetry breaking transitions in deconfined phases may be in the
same universality class, which is impossible under the conventional

accelerate or slow growth, depending on the genetic background and
environmental conditions. We evolved a diverse set of Escherichia coli
single-gene deletion mutants with a spectrum of growth rates and identified
mutations that generally increase growth rate. Despite the metabolic
differences between parent strains, mutations that enhanced growth largely
mapped to the core transcription machinery, including the $\beta$ and $\beta'$
subunits of RNA polymerase (RNAP) and the transcription elongation factor,
NusA. The structural segments of RNAP that determine enhanced growth have been
previously implicated in antibiotic resistance and in the control of
transcription elongation and pausing. We further developed a computational
framework to characterize how the transcriptional changes that occur upon
acquisition of these mutations affect growth rate across strains. Our
experimental and computational results provide evidence for cases in which RNAP
mutations shift the competitive balance between active transcription and gene
silencing. This study demonstrates that mutations in specific regions of RNAP
are a convergent adaptive solution that can enhance the growth rate of cells

onset of Roche lobe overflow. However, there are theoretical and observational
indications that mass transfer could occur in eccentric orbits. In particular,
eccentricity could be produced via sudden mass loss and velocity kicks during
supernova explosions, or Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations in hierarchical triple
systems, or, more generally, secular evolution in multiple-star systems.
However, current analytic models of eccentric mass transfer are faced with the
problem that they are only well defined in the limit of very high
eccentricities, and break down for less eccentric and circular orbits. This
provides a major obstacle to implementing such models in binary and
higher-order population synthesis codes, which are useful tools for studying
the long-term evolution of a large number of systems. Here, we present a new
analytic model to describe the secular orbital evolution of binaries undergoing
conservative mass transfer. The main improvement of our model is that the mass
transfer rate is a smoothly varying function of orbital phase, rather than a
delta function centered at periapsis. Consequently, our model is in principle
valid for any eccentricity, thereby overcoming the main limitation of previous
works. We implement our model in an easy-to-use and publicly available code
that can be used as a basis for implementations of our model into population
synthesis codes. We investigate the implications of our model in a number of
applications with circular and eccentric binaries, and triples undergoing LK
oscillations.

with misaligned winding, where the effective axion is not close to any of the

only 4 being previously classified as dusty reds. The AGN activity is not
prominent in the sample and, of the few cases of galaxies hosting AGN, such
activity does not seem to be correlated to the gas stripping phenomenon. Our
jellyfish galaxy candidates do not have a preferential pattern of motion within
the multi-cluster system, although the most compelling cases appear to inhabit
the inner regions of the most massive sub-cluster centres. The sSFR of these

High resolution and high signal-to-noise spectroscopic data of one

combinations of line lists and programs to measure equivalent widths of
absorption lines to characterize systematic differences within the same

vary up to ~170 K in T_eff, ~0.4 dex in log g and ~0.25 dex in [Fe/H] between

equation, where the small parameter $\hbar$ acts as a softening scale that
regulates singularities at shell-crossing. The leading-order propagator, called
free propagator, is the semiclassical equivalent of the Zel'dovich
approximation (ZA), that describes inertial particle motion along straight
trajectories. At next-to-leading order, we solve for the propagator
perturbatively and obtain, in the classical limit the displacement field from
second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT). The associated velocity
naturally includes an additional term that would be considered as third order
in LPT. We show that this term is actually needed to preserve the underlying
Hamiltonian structure, and ignoring it could lead to the spurious excitation of
vorticity in certain implementations of second-order LPT. We show that for
sufficiently small $\hbar$ the corresponding propagator solutions closely
resemble LPT, with the additions that spurious vorticity is avoided and the
dynamics at shell-crossing is regularised. Our analytical results possess a
symplectic structure that allows us to advance numerical schemes for the

Finally, we consider the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model

high-resolution shearing-box simulations. For large enough domain sizes, $L_y
\gtrsim 60H$, the disc settles down into a quasi-steady state, showing no long
term trends in properties or variation with box size. For smaller boxes, we
find that the azimuthal wavelength of the dominant spiral modes are limited to
the domain size. This is associated with a bursty behaviour that differs from
the quasi-steady dynamics at larger sizes. We point out that a similar
transition may be expected in global simulations at the point where the range
of azimuthal wavelengths is limited by the finite disc size. This condition
(i.e. when $60 H \sim 2 \pi R$, i.e. $H/R \sim 0.1$) correctly predicts the
transition to bursty behaviour previously found in global simulations for
disc-to-star mass ratios in excess of 0.25. We recover a transition in the
dynamics from two- to three-dimensional behaviour, characterized by a
turbulence that becomes more isotropic on small scales. This turbulence likely
plays an important role in the evolution of dust in self-gravitating discs,
potentially dominating the collision velocity for particles with Stokes number
$< 1$. Finally, we consider the stability of gravito-turbulence against
fragmentation, finding that discs which cool faster than a few dynamical times
fragment immediately, supporting previous results. We also find hints of
stochastic fragmentation at marginally longer cooling times, in which a
fragment forms from a quasi-equilibrium state. However, this makes little
practical difference to region where planet formation via gravitational
instability may occur.

Recent studies have found that fixation times in such systems often have
right-skewed distributions. Little is known, however, about how these
distributions and their skew depend on mutant fitness. Here we calculate the
fitness dependence of the fixation-time distribution for the Moran Birth-death
process in populations modeled by two extreme networks: the complete graph and
the one-dimensional ring lattice, obtaining exact solutions in the limit of
large network size. We find that with non-neutral fitness, the Moran process on
the ring has normally distributed fixation times, independent of the relative
fitness of mutants and non-mutants. In contrast, on the complete graph, the
fixation-time distribution is a fitness-weighted convolution of two Gumbel
distributions. When fitness is neutral the fixation-time distribution jumps
discontinuously and becomes highly skewed on both the complete graph and the
ring. Even on these simple networks, the fixation-time distribution exhibits
rich fitness dependence, with discontinuities and regions of universality.
Extensions of our results to two-fitness Moran models, times to partial
fixation, and evolution on random networks are discussed.

SFHs, whereas brighter dwarfs ($10^{7.5}<M_{\rm star}/M_\odot<10^{9}$) show the
opposite trend. Intermediate-mass dwarfs have roughly constant SFHs. Satellites
exhibit similar average trends, but with substantially suppressed star
formation in the most recent $\sim 5$ Gyr, likely as a result of gas loss due
to tidal and ram-pressure stripping after entering the haloes of their
primaries. These simple mass and environmental trends are in good agreement
with the derived SFHs of Local Group (LG) dwarfs whose photometry reaches the
oldest main sequence turnoff. SFHs of galaxies with less deep data show
deviations from these trends, but this may be explained, at least in part, by

damping terms in the neutrino effective potential and index of refraction. We
calculate the imaginary part of the neutrino self-energy in this case, from
which the damping terms are determined. The results are useful in the context
of Dark Matter-neutrino interaction models in which the scalar and/or fermion

term may be more significant if the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry in the

changes in magnetic field line connections are frequently observed to occur on
an Alfv\'enic time scale. Since it is mathematically impossible for magnetic
field line connections to change when non-ideal effects are identically zero,
an ideal evolution must naturally lead to states of unbounded sensitivity to
non-ideal effects. That such an evolution is natural is demonstrated using
Lagrangian coordinates based on the flow velocity of the magnetic field lines.
The Lagrangian representation of an evolving magnetic field is highly
constrained when neither the magnetic field strength nor the forces exerted by
the magnetic field increase exponentially with time. The development of a state
of fast reconnection consistent with these constraints (1) requires a
three-dimensional evolution, (2) has an exponentially increasing sensitivity to
non-ideal effects, and (3) has a parallel current density, which lies in
exponentially thinning but exponentially widening ribbons, with a magnitude
that is limited to a slow growth. The implication is that exponential growth in
sensitivity is the cause of fast magnetic reconnection when non-ideal effects
are sufficiently small. The growth of the non-ideal effect of the resistivity
multiplied by the parallel current density is far too slow to be competitive.

differentiation between the bands, for system away from half-filling ($n=3$),
as the Hubbard interaction $U$ is increased. This leads to orbital selective
Mott transitions where either the higher energy band (for $4>n>3$) or the lower

However, the use of blackbox methods has been heavily criticized for
high-stakes decisions and it has been argued that there does not have to be a
trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. To combine high accuracy with
interpretability, we generalize best subset selection to best split selection.
Best split selection constructs a small number of sparse models learned jointly
from the data which are then combined in an ensemble. Best split selection
determines the models by splitting the available predictor variables among the
different models when fitting the data. The proposed methodology results in an
ensemble of sparse and diverse models that each provide a possible explanation
for the relationship between the predictors and the response. The high

from collider experiments and $K^0$, $B_d$, $B_s$ physics, we investigate
scenarios where $W_R$ is lighter, or heavier than the right handed neutrino
$\nu_R$. In these scenarios, $W_R$ mass bounds can be considerably relaxed,
while $Z_R$ mass bounds are much more stringent. In the case where $M_{W_R} \le
M_{\nu_R}$, the experimental constraints come from $W_R \to tb $ and $W_R \to
jj$ channels, while if $M_{W_R} \ge M_{\nu_R}$, the dominant constraints come
from $W_R \to \ell \ell jj $. The observed (expected) limits in the
two-dimensional ($M_{W_R}$, $M_{\nu_R}$) mass plane excluded at 95\% confidence
level extend to approximately $M_{W_R}$= 3.1 (3.3) TeV in the $ee$ channel and
3.3 (3.4) TeV in the ($\mu\mu$) channel, for a large range of right-handed
neutrino masses up to $M_{\nu_R}$= 2.1 (2.1) TeV in the $ee$ channel and 2.6
(2.5) in the ($\mu\mu$) channel, representing a significant relaxation of the
mass bounds.

capture nontrivial associations between molecular features and drug response,

various ribbon geometries with different terminations, with and without

edge Dirac point is buried in the bulk bands for most edge terminations. In the
presence of a magnetic field, an in-gap edge Dirac point leads to exponential
suppression of conductance as an edge Zeeman gap opens, whereas the conductance
stays at the quantized value when the Dirac point is buried in the bulk bands.
Finally, we find that disorder in the edge termination drastically changes this

back and forth through phase transformation many times. Repeated phase
transformation develops permanent deformations originating from the significant
distortion that phase transformation induces at the austenite-martensite
interfaces and grain boundaries. This distortion drives dislocation activity
resulting in an observable macroscopic Transformation-Induced Plastic (TRIP)
deformation, which occurs at effective stress levels much lower than the
plastic yield limit of the material. TRIP strains may accumulate up to 20%
during the lifetime of an SMA component and thus a finite strain constitutive
model is required for simulating their response. In this work, a 3-D finite
strain model is developed based on logarithmic strain which is the only strain
measure whose rate is equal to the stretching, that describes phase
transformation and TRIP deformation in a thermodynamically consistent setting.
The model is implemented in Abaqus finite element software through a
user-defined material subroutine (UMAT). Boundary value problems such as strip
and a torque tube under both pseudoelastic and actuation cyclic loadings are
performed to test the capabilities of the newly proposed model.

apparently permanent deformation under specific thermomechanical loading. The
majority of constitutive models for SMAs are developed based on the
infinitesimal strain theory. However, such assumption may not be proper in the
presence of geometric discontinuities, such as cracks, and repeated cycling
loading that has been reported to induce irrecoverable strains up to 20% due to
transformation induced plasticity. In addition to finite strains, SMA-based
devices may also undergo large rotations. Thus, it is indispensable to develop
a constitutive model based on the finite strain to provide accurate predictions
of these actuators response. A three-dimensional phenomenological constitutive
model for SMAs considering finite strains and finite rotations is proposed in
this work. This model utilizes the logarithmic strain as the strain measure
that is the strain measure whose logarithmic rate in a corotating material
frame is equal to the rate of deformation tensor. In the proposed model, the
martensitic volume fraction and the second-order logarithmic transformation
strain tensor are chosen as the internal state variables associated with the
inelastic transformation process. Numerical simulations considering basic SMAs

test the capabilities of the proposed model under both mechanically and

  Necessary to Use a Sledgehammer to Crack an Egg?","47 pages, 10 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multivariate elliptically-contoured distributions are widely used for
modeling economic and financial data. We study the problem of estimating moment
parameters of a semi-parametric elliptical model in a high-dimensional setting.
Such estimators are useful for financial data analysis and quadratic
discriminant analysis. For low-dimensional elliptical models, efficient moment
estimators can be obtained by plugging in an estimate of the precision matrix.
Natural generalizations of the plug-in estimator to high-dimensional settings
perform unsatisfactorily, due to estimating a large precision matrix. Do we
really need a sledgehammer to crack an egg? Fortunately, we discover that
moment parameters can be efficiently estimated without estimating the precision
matrix in high-dimension. We propose a marginal aggregation estimator (MAE) for
moment parameters. The MAE only requires estimating the diagonal of covariance
matrix and is convenient to implement. With mild sparsity on the covariance
structure, we prove that the asymptotic variance of MAE is the same as the
ideal plug-in estimator which knows the true precision matrix, so MAE is
asymptotically efficient. We also extend MAE to a block-wise aggregation
estimator (BAE) when estimates of diagonal blocks of covariance matrix are
available. The performance of our methods is validated by extensive simulations
and an application to financial returns.

active/smart morphing structures in the engineering industry. Because of the
high actuation energy density of SMAs, compared to other active materials,
structures integrated with SMA-based actuators has high advantage in terms of
trade-offs between overall structure weight, integrity and functionality. The
majority of available constitutive models for SMAs are developed within the
infinitesimal strain regime. However, it was reported that particular SMAs can
generate transformation strains nearly up to 8%-10%, for which the adopted
infinitesimal strain assumption is no longer appropriate. Furthermore, industry
applications may require SMA actuators undergo large rotation deformation at
work. Combining the above two facts, a constitutive model for SMAs developed on
a finite deformation framework is required. A three-dimensional constitutive
model for SMAs considering large strains with large rotations is proposed in
this work. This model utilizes the logarithmic strain as a finite strain
measure for large deformation analysis so that its rate form hypo-elastic
constitutive relation can be consistently integrated to deliver a free energy
based hyper-elastic constitutive relation. The martensitic volume fraction and
the second-order transformation strain tensor are chosen as the internal state
variables to characterize the inelastic response exhibited by polycrystalline
SMAs. The presented formulation and its numerical implementation scheme can be
extended in future work for the incorporation of other inelastic phenomena such
as transformation-induced plasticity, viscoplasticity and creep under large
deformations.

heating above ambient temperature in the range of negative differential

resistance $R_L$. Steady state I(V) is obtained for $R_L> |dV/dI|_{max}$ in the
NDR regime. For $R_L< |dV/dI|_{max}$ there is switching between initial and
final steady states associated with peaks in the Joule power, that are higher

damaging the samples. On the other hand, the large $R_L$ needed for steady
state is the main power consumer in the circuit at high currents. The present
work is motivated by the need to avoid damaging switching in the NDR regime
while reducing the power consumption in the circuit. It is shown here that
large resistance modulation can be obtained under steady state conditions with
reduced power consumption by increasing the ambient temperature of the device

systems power laws can not develop with arbitrarily steep slopes at large
scales, i.e. when $|\delta \bf{B}|$ becomes of the order of the background
field $|\bf{B}|$. In such systems there is a scale $l_0$ at which the spectrum
has to break due to the condition of weak compressibility. A very good example
of this dynamics is offered by solar wind fluctuations in Alfv\'enic fast
streams, characterised by the property of constant field magnitude. We show
here that the distribution of $\delta B=|\delta \bf{B}|$ in the fast wind
displays a strong cut-off at $\delta B/|{\bf B}|\lesssim2$, as expected for
fluctuations bounded on a sphere of radius $B=|{\bf B}|$. This is also
associated with a saturation of the rms of the fluctuations at large scales and
introduces a specific length $l_0$ above which the amplitude of the
fluctuations becomes independent on the scale $l$. Consistent with that, the
power spectrum at $l>l_0$ is characterised by a -1 spectral slope, as expected
for fluctuations that are scale-independent. Moreover, we show that the
spectral break between the 1/f and inertial range in solar wind spectra indeed
corresponds to the scale $l_0$ at which $\left<\delta B/B\right>\sim1$. Such a
simple model provides a possible alternative explanation of magnetic spectra
observed in interplanetary space, also pointing out the inconsistency for a
plasma to simultaneously maintain $|\bf{B}|\sim$const. at arbitrarily large
scales and satisfy a Kolmogorov scaling.

decentralized way, by simply choosing them randomly. Traditional network
decoding techniques apply directly when all original packets have different

methods for identifying important predictors in the high-dimensional linear
regression model, i.e. when the number of rows of the design matrix X is
smaller than the number of columns. By definition, BP uniquely recovers the
vector of regression coefficients b if there is no noise and the vector b has
the smallest L1 norm among all vectors s such that Xb=Xs (identifiability
condition). Furthermore, LASSO can recover the sign of b only under a much
stronger irrepresentability condition. Meanwhile, it is known that the model
selection properties of LASSO can be improved by hard-thresholding its
estimates. This article supports these findings by proving that thresholded
LASSO, thresholded BPDN and thresholded BP recover the sign of b in both the
noisy and noiseless cases if and only if b is identifiable and large enough. In
particular, if X has iid Gaussian entries and the number of predictors grows
linearly with the sample size, then these thresholded estimators can recover
the sign of b when the signal sparsity is asymptotically below the
Donoho-Tanner transition curve. This is in contrast to the regular LASSO, which
asymptotically recovers the sign of b only when the signal sparsity tends to 0.
Numerical experiments show that the identifiability condition, unlike the
irrepresentability condition, does not seem to be affected by the structure of
the correlations in the $X$ matrix.

melting does not occur if $\Delta \gamma$ is negative. We test this model,
which assumes the surface energies of the wire are isotropic, using molecular
dynamics simulations. For nickel, we observe the onset of anisotropic surface
melting associated with each of the two surface facets present, but this gives
way to uniform surface melting and the solid melts radially until the solid
core eventually breaks up. For aluminium, while we observe complete surface
melting of one facet, the lowest energy surface remains partially dry even up
to the point where the melt completely penetrates the solid core.

we call training set camouflage. Imagine Alice has a training set on an illicit
machine learning classification task. Alice wants Bob (a machine learning
system) to learn the task. However, sending either the training set or the
trained model to Bob can raise suspicion if the communication is monitored.
Training set camouflage allows Alice to compute a second training set on a
completely different -- and seemingly benign -- classification task. By
construction, sending the second training set will not raise suspicion. When
Bob applies his standard (public) learning algorithm to the second training
set, he approximately recovers the classifier on the original task. Training
set camouflage is a novel form of steganography in machine learning. We
formulate training set camouflage as a combinatorial bilevel optimization
problem and propose solvers based on nonlinear programming and local search.
Experiments on real classification tasks demonstrate the feasibility of such
camouflage.

diode-like to resistor-like behavior. Such phenomenon resembles the
current-density saturation effect in conventional semiconductors. In the
present paper, we adapt the formalism developed for conventional semiconductors
to study current-density saturation in (N)UNCD field emitters. We provide a
comprehensive theoretical investigation of ($i$) the influence of partial
penetration of the electric field into the material, ($ii$) transport effects

density-of-states structure (position and shape of $\pi-\pi^*$ bands,
controlling the concentration of charge carriers) on the FE characteristics of
(N)UNCD. We show that the formation of the current-density saturation plateau
can be explained by the limited supply of electrons within the impurity
$\pi-\pi^*$ bands and decreasing electron mobility in high electric field.

substantially different, the failure loads of the former configuration being
about three times lower than the latter one. To capture this interesting
behavior a two-scale cohesive model is proposed. The model is in excellent

(a) residual plastic stresses cannot explain the very high failure loads of
notched structures; (b) the strength of the polymer at the microscale can be
from six to ten times larger than the values measured from conventional tests

and some are still obtained from non-exploding models. We therefore calculate
waveforms up to 0.9\,s after bounce using the neutrino hydrodynamics code
\textsc{CoCoNuT-FMT}. We consider two models with low and normal explosion
energy, namely explosions of an ultra-stripped progenitor with an initial
helium star mass of $3.5\,M_{\odot}$, and of an $18\,M_{\odot}$ single star.
Both models show gravitational wave emission from the excitation of surface

  Collection in LoRaWAN","16 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, and 2 algorithms",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  LoRaWAN promises to provide wide-area network access to low-cost devices that
can operate for up to 10 years on a single 1000 mAh battery. This makes LoRaWAN
particularly suited to data collection applications (e.g. monitoring
applications), where device lifetime is a key performance metric. However, when
supporting a large number of devices, LoRaWAN suffers from a scalability issue
due to the high collision probability of its Aloha-based MAC layer. The
performance worsens further when using acknowledged transmissions due to the
duty cycle restriction at the gateway. For this, we propose FREE, a
fine-grained scheduling scheme for reliable and energy-efficient data
collection in LoRaWAN. FREE takes advantage of applications that do not have
hard delay requirements on data delivery by supporting synchronized bulk data
transmission. This means data is buffered for transmission in scheduled time
slots instead of transmitted straight away. FREE allocates spreading factors,
transmission powers, frequency channels, time slots, and schedules slots in
frames for LoRaWAN end-devices. As a result, FREE overcomes the scalability
problem of LoRaWAN by eliminating collisions and grouping acknowledgments. We
evaluate the performance of FREE versus different legacy LoRaWAN
configurations. The numerical results show that FREE scales well and achieves
almost 100% data delivery and the device lifetime is estimated to over 10 years
independent of traffic type and network size. Comparing to poor scalability,
low data delivery and device lifetime of fewer than 2 years for acknowledged
data traffic in the standard LoRaWAN configurations.

UPt3 with ultrasound (US) as a probe we identify clear signatures in field
sweeps demarkating new high field spin states. Magnetostriction (MS)
measurements performed up to 65 T also show signatures at the same fields
confirming these state transitions. At the very lowest temperatures (<200 mK)
we also observe magneto-acoustic quantum oscillations which for theta =

resolution magnetization measurements for this same angle reveal a continuous
variation of the magnetization implying the subtle nature of the implied
transitions. With B rotated away from the c-axis, the US signatures occur at
nearly the same field. These state transitions merge with the separate sequence
of the well known metamagnetic transition which commences at 20 T for theta =

tricritical behavior, occurs at \theta ~ 51{\deg} from the ab-plane. This is an
unique off-symmetry angle where the length change is precisely zero due to the
anisotropic nature of MS in UPt3 for all magnetic field values.

observations of the moderate-size spot on October 2011 and within 25% the data
of a similar sized spot on March 2016, but predicted too low values for the big

flux atmospheric model which, however, could not reproduce the peak brightness
temperature of $4.7\times10^6$ K and the shape of the source at the NoRH

non-thermal emission associated to a moving pore and to an opposite polarity
light bridge. We also found that the double structure of the big spot at high

wavelengths. Observations over the last ~20 years have revealed X-ray flares
that rise above a quiescent thermal background about once per day, while faint
X-ray flares from Sgr A* are undetectable below the constant thermal emission.
In contrast, the IR emission of Sgr A* is observed to be continuously variable.
Recently, simultaneous observations have indicated a rise in IR flux density
around the same time as every distinct X-ray flare, while the opposite is not
always true (peaks in the IR emission may not be coincident with an X-ray
flare). Characterizing the behaviour of these simultaneous X-ray/IR events and
measuring any time lag between them can constrain models of Sgr A*'s accretion
flow and the flare emission mechanism. Using 100+ hours of data from a

approximately 10-20 minutes with 68% confidence. However, the 99.7% confidence
interval on the time-lag also includes zero, i.e., the flaring remains

From this point of view, regular theories are certain monoidal 2-functors from

to each context the set of formulas in that context, ordered by entailment. We
refer to such a 2-functor as a regular calculus because it naturally gives rise

jets, which could expand to form radio bubbles with relativistic electrons in
the intracluster medium (ICM). It has been suggested that fossil relativistic
electrons contained in remnant bubbles from extinct radio galaxies can be
re-accelerated to radio-emitting energies by merger-driven shocks via diffusive
shock acceleration (DSA), leading to the birth of radio relics detected in
clusters. In this study we assume that such bubble consist primarily of thermal
gas entrained from the surrounding medium and dynamically-insignificant amounts
of relativistic electrons. We also consider several realistic models for
magnetic fields in the cluster outskirts, including the ICM field that scales
with the gas density as $B_{\rm ICM}\propto n_{\rm ICM}^{0.5}$. Then we perform
time-dependent DSA simulations of a spherical shock that runs into a
lower-density but higher-temperature bubble with the ratio $n_{\rm b}/n_{\rm
ICM} \approx T_{\rm ICM}/T_{\rm b}\approx 0.5$. We find that inside the bubble
the shock speed increases by about 20 \%, but the Mach number decreases by
about 15\% in the case under consideration. In this re-acceleration model, the
observed properties of a radio relic such as radio flux, spectral index, and
integrated spectrum would be governed mainly by the presence of seed
relativistic electrons and the magnetic field profile as well as shock
dynamics. Thus it is crucial to understand how fossil electrons are deposited
by AGNs in the ICM and how the downstream magnetic field evolves behind the
shock in detailed modeling of radio relics.

convergence in the median spherically-averaged circular velocity profiles for

focused on single haloes, our results suggest that cosmological simulations
yield robust halo properties for a wide range of gravitational softening
parameters, $\epsilon$, provided: 1) $\epsilon$ is not larger than a
""convergence radius"", $r_{\rm conv}$, which is dictated by 2-body relaxation
and determined by particle number, and 2) a sufficient number of timesteps are
taken to accurately resolve particle orbits with short dynamical times.
Provided these conditions are met, median circular velocity profiles converge
to within $\approx 10$ per cent for radii beyond which the local 2-body
relaxation timescale exceeds the Hubble time by a factor $\kappa\equiv t_{\rm

$\kappa$. We provide analytic estimates of $r_{\rm conv}$ that build on
previous attempts in two ways: first, by highlighting its explicit (but weak)
softening-dependence and, second, by providing a simpler criterion in which
$r_{\rm conv}$ is determined entirely by the mean inter-particle spacing, $l$;
for example, better than $10$ per cent convergence in circular velocity for
$r\gt 0.05\,l$. We show how these analytic criteria can be used to assess
convergence in structural scaling relations for dark matter haloes as a
function of their mass or maximum circular speed.

quantum mechanically and the bath is treated in a classical-like fashion. By
solving a set of coupled first-order deterministic differential equations for
the quantum and classical degrees of freedom, one can compute the QSL time. To
demonstrate the utility of the method, we study the unbiased spin-boson model

turnover of the QSL time in the strong coupling regime, which is indicative of
a speed-up in the quantum evolution. We also apply the method to the Fenna-

for the three-dimensional shape of the nucleoid, such that nucleoid-bound PomZ
dimers can diffuse past the cluster without interacting with it. Using
stochastic simulations, we find that the cluster still moves to and localizes
at midcell. Redistribution of PomZ by diffusion in the cytosol is essential for
this cluster dynamics. Our mechanism also positions two clusters equidistantly

performance is achieved while running at 62 Hz: a 2 - 4 fold runtime
improvement. A faster version of our method matches the state of the art at 105

re-identification (re-ID) dataset, which makes fully supervised methods
inapplicable to real-world deployment. How to maximally reduce the annotation
cost while retaining the re-ID performance becomes an interesting problem. In
this paper, we address this problem by integrating an active learning scheme
into a deep learning framework. Noticing that the truly matched tracklet-pairs,
also denoted as true positives (TP), are the most informative samples for our
re-ID model, we propose a sampling criterion to choose the most TP-likely
tracklet-pairs for annotation. A view-aware sampling strategy considering
view-specific biases is designed to facilitate candidate selection, followed by
an adaptive resampling step to leave out the selected candidates that are
unnecessary to annotate. Our method learns the re-ID model and updates the
annotation set iteratively. The re-ID model is supervised by the tracklets'
pesudo labels that are initialized by treating each tracklet as a distinct
class. With the gained annotations of the actively selected candidates, the
tracklets' pesudo labels are updated by label merging and further used to
re-train our re-ID model. While being simple, the proposed method demonstrates
its effectiveness on three video-based person re-ID datasets. Experimental
results show that less than 3\% pairwise annotations are needed for our method
to reach comparable performance with the fully-supervised setting.

  The FITSWebQL server enables viewing of even 100GB-large FITS files in a web

zoom-in to selected areas of interest with the corresponding frequency spectrum
being calculated on the server in near real-time. The client (a browser) is a
JavaScript application built on WebSockets, HTML5, WebGL and SVG.
  There are many challenges when providing a web browser-based real-time FITS

The upgraded version tries to overcome the latency issue by predicting user
mouse movements with a Kalman Filter in order to speculatively deliver the
real-time spectrum data at a point where the user is likely to be looking at.
The new version also allows one to view multiple FITS files simultaneously in
an RGB composite mode (NRO45M FUGIN only), where each dataset is assigned one
RGB channel to form a colour image. Spectra from multiple FITS cubes are shown
together too.
  The paper briefly describes main features of FITSWebQL. We also touch on some
of the recent developments, such as an experimental switch from C/C++ to Rust
(see https://www.rust-lang.org/) for improved stability, better memory
management and fearless concurrency, or attempts to display FITS data cubes in

AUs make subtle facial appearance change over various regions at different
scales. Current works have attempted to recognize AUs by emphasizing important
regions. However, the incorporation of expert prior knowledge into region
definition remains under-exploited, and current AU detection approaches do not
use regional convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) with expert prior knowledge
to directly focus on AU-related regions adaptively. By incorporating expert
prior knowledge, we propose a novel R-CNN based model named AU R-CNN. The
proposed solution offers two main contributions: (1) AU R-CNN directly observes
different facial regions, where various AUs are located. Specifically, we
define an AU partition rule which encodes the expert prior knowledge into the
region definition and RoI-level label definition. This design produces
considerably better detection performance than existing approaches. (2) We
integrate various dynamic models (including convolutional long short-term
memory, two stream network, conditional random field, and temporal action
localization network) into AU R-CNN and then investigate and analyze the reason
behind the performance of dynamic models. Experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{only} static RGB image information and no optical flow-based AU R-CNN
surpasses the one fused with dynamic models. AU R-CNN is also superior to
traditional CNNs that use the same backbone on varying image resolutions.
State-of-the-art recognition performance of AU detection is achieved. The
complete network is end-to-end trainable. Experiments on BP4D and DISFA
datasets show the effectiveness of our approach. The implementation code is

Multiple defense mechanisms have been proposed which aim to hinder the

samples are much more sensitive than normal samples if we impose random

empirically that normal samples and adversarial samples have distinguishable
sensitivity. We then integrate statistical hypothesis testing and model
mutation testing to check whether an input sample is likely to be normal or
adversarial at runtime by measuring its sensitivity. We evaluated our approach

The first is that $RS$ is guaranteed to find an action whose value is above the
aspiration level. The second is that the regret (expected loss) of $RS$ is
upper bounded by a finite value, given that the aspiration level is set to an
""optimal level"" so that satisficing implies optimizing. We confirm the results

that significantly differ from normal data. UAD is typically solved by using
density estimation. Recently, deep neural network (DNN)-based density
estimators, such as Normalizing Flows, have been attracting attention. However,
one of their drawbacks is the difficulty in adapting them to the change in the
normal data's distribution. To address this difficulty, we propose AdaFlow, a
new DNN-based density estimator that can be easily adapted to the change of the
distribution. AdaFlow is a unified model of a Normalizing Flow and Adaptive
Batch-Normalizations, a module that enables DNNs to adapt to new distributions.
AdaFlow can be adapted to a new distribution by just conducting forward
propagation once per sample; hence, it can be used on devices that have limited
computational resources. We have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
model through an anomaly detection in a sound task. We also propose a method of
applying AdaFlow to the unpaired cross-domain translation problem, in which one
has to train a cross-domain translation model with only unpaired samples. We
have confirmed that our model can be used for the cross-domain translation
problem through experiments on image datasets.

TTb = 15 K. The intricate temperature development of the metamagnetism along
the c-axis results in a large negative change in the magnetic entropy at low

certainties and penalize the wrong predictions on them. Finally, we devise a
competitive training scheme to further boost the generalization ability of

require 2D-3D pairs of ground-truth data for supervision. Such data is costly
to acquire, and most datasets available in the literature are restricted to
pairs for which the input 2D images depict faces in a near fronto-parallel
pose. Therefore, many data-driven methods for single-image 3D facial
reconstruction perform poorly on profile and near-profile faces. We propose a
method to improve the performance of single-image 3D facial reconstruction
networks by utilizing the network to synthesize its own training data for
fine-tuning, comprising: (i) single-image 3D reconstruction of faces in
near-frontal images without ground-truth 3D shape; (ii) application of a
rigid-body transformation to the reconstructed face model; (iii) rendering of
the face model from new viewpoints; and (iv) use of the rendered image and
corresponding 3D reconstruction as additional data for supervised fine-tuning.
The new 2D-3D pairs thus produced have the same high-quality observed for near
fronto-parallel reconstructions, thereby nudging the network towards more
uniform performance as a function of the viewing angle of input faces.
Application of the proposed technique to the fine-tuning of a state-of-the-art
single-image 3D-reconstruction network for faces demonstrates the usefulness of
the method, with particularly significant gains for profile or near-profile
views.

originates with a customized 3D deep neural network to fully explore the

network reduce the overlap between the foreground and background and thus
sharpen the predictions on boundary. We then propose a novel Focal Positive
loss to guide the learning of voxel-specific threshold and emphasize the
foreground to improve classification sensitivity. Further improvement is
obtained with an recursive training scheme. With ablation studies, all the
introduced modules prove to be effective. The proposed framework achieves an

Holes (BH's) in spherically symmetric and static spacetimes within the
framework of general relativity with matter composed by a complex-valued
scalar-field does not lead to a straightforward conclusion about the absence of
hair in the stationary and rotating (axisymmetric) scenario. We argue that such
a failure can be used to justify in a simple and heuristic way the existence of
non-trivial boson clouds or hair found numerically by Herdeiro and Radu [1,2]
and analytically by Hod in the test field limit [3-5]. This is due to the
presence of a contribution that is negative when rotation exists which allows
for an integral to vanish even when a non-trivial boson hair is present. The
presence of such a negative contribution that depends on the rotation
properties of the BH is perfectly correlated with the eigenvalue problem
associated with the boson-field equation. Conversely, when the rotation is
absent the integral turns to be composed only by non negative (i.e. positive
semidefinite) terms and thus the only way it can vanish is when the hair is
completely absent. This analysis poses serious challenges and obstructions
towards the elaboration of no-hair theorems for more general spacetimes endowed
with a BH region even when including matter fields that obey the energy
conditions. Thus rotating boson stars, if collapsed, may lead indeed to a new
type of rotating BH, like the ones found in [1,2]. In order to achieve this
analysis we solve numerically the eigenvalue problem for the boson field in the
Kerr-BH background by imposing rigorous regularity conditions at the BH horizon
for the non-extremal case ($0<a<M$) which include the near extremal one in the
limit $M\rightarrow a$, as well as the small BH limit $M\rightarrow
a\rightarrow 0$.

morphology within a core-scale ($\lesssim 1.0$ pc) hub-filament structure (HFS)
located at the end of a parsec-scale filament. To investigate whether or not
the observed polarization traces the magnetic field in the HFS, we analyze the
dependence between the observed polarization fraction and total intensity using
a Bayesian approach with the polarization fraction described by the Rice
likelihood function, which can correctly describe the probability density
function (PDF) of the observed polarization fraction for low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) data. We find a power-law dependence between the polarization
fraction and total intensity with an index of 0.56 in $A_V\sim$ 20--300 mag
regions, suggesting that the dust grains in these dense regions can still be
aligned with magnetic fields in the IC5146 regions. Our polarization maps
reveal a curved magnetic field, possibly dragged by the contraction along the
parsec-scale filament. We further obtain a magnetic field strength of
0.5$\pm$0.2 mG toward the central hub using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi
method, corresponding to a mass-to-flux criticality of $\sim$ $1.3\pm0.4$ and
an Alfv\'{e}nic Mach number of $<$0.6. These results suggest that gravity and
magnetic field is currently of comparable importance in the HFS, and turbulence
is less important.

$n$ points from a domain and a function value at each point. Our objective is
to determine if this partial function can be extended to a function defined on
the domain, that additionally satisfies a given property, such as convexity.
This basic problem underlies research questions in many areas, such as
learning, property testing, and game theory. We formally study the problem of
extending partial functions to satisfy fundamental properties in combinatorial
optimization, focusing on upper and lower bounds for extension and applications
to learning and property testing.
  (1) For subadditive functions, we show the extension problem is
coNP-complete, and we give tight bounds on the approximability. We also give an
improved lower bound for learning subadditive functions, and give the first
nontrivial testers for subadditive and XOS functions.
  (2) For submodular functions, we show that if a partial function can be
extended to a submodular function on the lattice closure (the minimal set that
contains the partial function and is closed under union and intersection) of
the partial function, it can be extended to a submodular function on the entire
domain. We obtain algorithms for determining extendibility in a number of
cases, including if $n$ is a constant, or the points are nearly the same size.
The complexity of extendibility is in general unresolved.
  (3) Lastly, for convex functions in $\mathbb{R}^m$, we show an interesting
juxtaposition: while we can determine the existence of an extension
efficiently, computing the value of a widely-studied convex extension at a
given point is strongly NP-hard.

This plate element contains only 12 degrees of freedom (DoFs) over a

  Rectification","Accepted to CVPR 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated recognition of texts in scenes has been a research challenge for
years, largely due to the arbitrary variation of text appearances in
perspective distortion, text line curvature, text styles and different types of
imaging artifacts. The recent deep networks are capable of learning robust
representations with respect to imaging artifacts and text style changes, but
still face various problems while dealing with scene texts with perspective and
curvature distortions. This paper presents an end-to-end trainable scene text
recognition system (ESIR) that iteratively removes perspective distortion and
text line curvature as driven by better scene text recognition performance. An
innovative rectification network is developed which employs a novel
line-fitting transformation to estimate the pose of text lines in scenes. In
addition, an iterative rectification pipeline is developed where scene text
distortions are corrected iteratively towards a fronto-parallel view. The ESIR
is also robust to parameter initialization and the training needs only scene
text images and word-level annotations as required by most scene text
recognition systems. Extensive experiments over a number of public datasets
show that the proposed ESIR is capable of rectifying scene text distortions
accurately, achieving superior recognition performance for both normal scene
text images and those suffering from perspective and curvature distortions.

gauge-covariant decomposition plays the dominant role in quark confinement.
This framework improves the Abelian projection in the gauge-independent manner.
For quarks in the fundamental representation, we have demonstrated some
numerical evidences for the dual superconductivity. However, it is known that
the expected behavior of the Wilson loop in higher representations cannot be
reproduced if the restricted part of the Wilson loop is extracted by adopting
the Abelian projection or the field decomposition naively in the same way as in
the fundamental representation. In this talk, therefore, we focus on
confinement of quarks in higher representations. By virtue of the non-Abelian
Stokes theorem for the Wilson loop operator, we propose suitable operators
constructed from the restricted field only in the fundamental representation to
reproduce the correct behavior of the original Wilson loop in higher
representations. Moreover, we perform lattice simulations to measure the static
potential for quarks in higher representations using the proposed operators. We
find that the proposed operators well reproduce the expected behavior of the
original Wilson loop average, which overcomes the problem that occurs in
naively applying Abelian-projection to the Wilson loop operator for higher
representations.

potentials in realistic image synthesis whereas most existing works address
synthesis realism in either appearance space or geometry space but few in both.
This paper presents an innovative Spatial Fusion GAN (SF-GAN) that combines a
geometry synthesizer and an appearance synthesizer to achieve synthesis realism
in both geometry and appearance spaces. The geometry synthesizer learns
contextual geometries of background images and transforms and places foreground
objects into the background images unanimously. The appearance synthesizer
adjusts the color, brightness and styles of the foreground objects and embeds
them into background images harmoniously, where a guided filter is introduced
for detail preserving. The two synthesizers are inter-connected as mutual
references which can be trained end-to-end without supervision. The SF-GAN has
been evaluated in two tasks: (1) realistic scene text image synthesis for
training better recognition models; (2) glass and hat wearing for realistic
matching glasses and hats with real portraits. Qualitative and quantitative
comparisons with the state-of-the-art demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed SF-GAN.

of standing accretion shocks with upstream vorticity perturbations is
investigated by linear theory analysis. The endothermic effect associated to
the nuclear dissociation, which takes place right behind the shock wave,
affects the amplitude of the perturbations amplified/generated across the
front. For upstream disturbances whose characteristic size is much larger than
the post-shock dissociation-layer thickness, the effect of nuclear dissociation
can be reduced to that of considering the global endothermic effect that scales
with the inflow energy flux. The present study focuses on perturbation fields
that are not isotropic, which mimic the perturbations in collapsing convective
shells of massive stars. The linear interaction of the shock with bidimensional
mono-frequency vorticity perturbations is theoretically addressed, with the
limit of highly-stretched vortices being analyzed in detail. The exact spatial
distribution of the rotational and acoustic perturbations generated in the
post-shock flow are provided along with the transient evolution of the shock

oscillations, but increases the amplitude of the density perturbations

stress environment or from afterslip dynamics is crucial to the understanding
of the nature of aftershocks. We build on a classical description of the fault
and creeping regions as two blocks connected elastically, subject to different
friction laws. We show analytically that, upon introduction of variability in
the fault plane's static friction threshold, a non trivial stick-slip dynamics
ensues. In particular we support the hypothesis \citep{PA04} that the
aftershock occurrence rate is proportional to the afterslip rate, up to a
corrective factor that is also computed. Thus, the Omori law originates from
the afterslip's logarithmic evolution in the velocity-strengthening region. We
confirm these analytical results with numerical simulations, generating
synthetic catalogs with statistical features in good agreement with
instrumental catalogs. In particular we recover the Gutenberg-Richter law with
a realistic $b$-value ($b\simeq 1$) when Coulomb stress thresholds obey a power
law distribution.

states of light to distribute secret encryption keys between two parties. One
of the challenges is thereby the requirement of capacity approaching error
correcting codes in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) regime (SNR < 0 dB).
Multilevel coding (MLC) combined with multistage decoding (MSD) can solve this
challenge in combination with multi-edge-type low-density parity-check

to degree-one variable nodes. However, the complexity of designing such highly

use G-EXIT charts to exemplary find codes for some given rates which provide a
better decoding threshold compared to previously reported codes. In comparison
to the traditional density evolution method, G-EXIT charts offer a simple and

pressure gradients generated by population growth. Little prior work has
explored the relation between such continuum models and related

model for the spatial dynamics of multicellular systems whereby cells undergo
pressure-driven movement and pressure-dependent proliferation.We show that
nonlinear partial differential equations commonly used to model the spatial

multiple cell populations with different biophysical properties. The outcomes
of our comparative study demonstrate that the results of computational
simulations of the individual-based model faithfully mirror the qualitative and
quantitative properties of the solutions to the corresponding nonlinear partial
differential equations. Ultimately, these results illustrate how the simple
rules governing the dynamics of single cells in our individual-based model can
lead to the emergence of complex spatial patterns of population growth observed

the new ephemeris predicts transit timings with uncertainties of less than 6

In previous numerical simulations, a formation of stable multicluster states

impossible. Integrating with various time steps reveals that clustering is a
numerical artifact, explained by the existence of higher order Fourier terms in
the errors of the employed numerical integration schemes. Monitoring the
induced change in certain integrals of motion we quantify these errors. We
support these observations by showing, on the basis of the analysis of the
corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, that two-cluster states are
non-attractive. On the other hand, in ensembles of general limit cycle
oscillators, such as Van der Pol oscillators, due to an anharmonic phase
response function, as well as additional amplitude dynamics, multiclusters can
occur naturally.

migration of hot Jupiters are two outstanding problems in planet formation. The
hot Jupiter $\tau$ Boo Ab orbits the primary star in the long-period ($P
\gtrsim 1000\,$yr), highly eccentric ($e \sim 0.9$) binary $\tau$ Bo\""otis. Due
to the long orbital period, the orbit of the stellar binary is poorly
constrained. Here we aim to constrain the orbit of the stellar binary $\tau$
Boo AB in order to investigate the formation and migration history of the
system. The mutual orbital inclination of the stellar companion and the hot
Jupiter has important implications for planet migration. The binary
eccentricity and periastron distance are important for understanding the
conditions under which $\tau$ Boo Ab formed. We combine more than 150 years of
astrometric data with twenty-five years of high precision radial velocities.
The combination of sky-projected and line-of-sight measurements places tight
constraints on the orbital inclination, eccentricity, and periastron distance
of $\tau$ Boo AB. We find an orbital inclination of $47.2^{+2.7}_{-3.7}\,$deg,
periastron distance of $28.3^{+2.3}_{-3.0}\,$au and eccentricity of
$0.87^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$. We find that the orbital inclinations of $\tau$ Boo Ab
and $\tau$ Boo B, as well as the stellar spin-axis of $\tau$ Boo A coincide at
$\sim \! 45$ degrees, a result consistent with the assumption of a
well-aligned, coplanar system. The likely aligned, coplanar configuration
suggests planetary migration within a well-aligned protoplanetary disc. Due to
the high eccentricity and small periastron distance of $\tau$ Boo B, the
protoplanetary disc was tidally truncated at $\approx \! 6\,$au. We suggest
that $\tau$ Boo Ab formed near the edge of the truncated disc and migrated
inwards with high eccentricity due to spiral waves generated by the stellar
companion.

models predict that a significant amount of magnetic energy should be released
prior to the merger, leading to electromagnetic precursor emission. In this
paper, we revisit this problem in the light of the recent progress in kinetic
modeling of pulsar magnetospheres. We limit our work to the case of aligned
magnetic moments and rotation axes, and thus neglect the orbital motion. We
perform global two-dimensional axisymmetric particle-in-cell simulations of two
pulsar magnetospheres merging at a rate consistent with the emission of
gravitational waves. Both symmetric and asymmetric systems are investigated.
Simulations show a significant enhancement of magnetic dissipation within the
magnetospheres as both stars get closer. Even though the magnetospheric
configuration depends on the relative orientations of the pulsar spins and
magnetic axes, all configurations present nearly the same radiative signature,
indicating that a common dissipation mechanism is at work. The relative motion
of both pulsars drives magnetic reconnection at the boundary between the two
magnetospheres, leading to efficient particle acceleration and high-energy
synchrotron emission. Polar-cap discharge is also strongly enhanced in
asymmetric configurations, resulting in vigorous pair production and
potentially additional high-energy radiation. We observe an increase in the
pulsar radiative efficiency by two orders of magnitude over the last orbit
before the merger exceeding the spindown power of an isolated pulsar. The
expected signal is too weak to be detected at high energies even in the nearby
universe. However, if a small fraction of this energy is channeled into radio
waves, it could be observed as a non-repeating fast radio burst.

source of buoyancy, have been described with great success using a horizontally
averaged model for the conservation of mass, momentum and buoyancy flux.
However, experimental observations of plumes with time-dependent buoyancy
fluxes has proved more challenging for quantitative models. At each level in
the plume, the horizontal variation in velocity leads to an along-axis shear
and hence dispersive transport relative to the mean. With a time-dependent
source, axial dispersion of the dynamic properties of the plume has a key role
in the evolution of the flow. Using ideas of mixing length theory, we introduce
a model for this axial dispersion, and test the model by comparison with
experimental observations of plumes in which the buoyancy flux is suddenly
decreased or suddenly increased. In both cases, we show the transition from one
buoyancy flux to another is self-similar, and using the data, we find the axial
dispersion may be expressed as \beta Ub where \beta\ lies in the range
0.70-0.88 and U and b are respectively the horizontally averaged vertical

or weight starts to decline relative to a suitable comparison population.
However, there is currently a lack of consensus on both the choice of
anthropometric indexes for characterizing growth over time and the operational
definition of faltering. Cole's classic conditional standard deviation scores
is a popular metric but can be problematic, since it only utilizes two data
points and relies on having complete data. In the existing literature,
arbitrary thresholds are often used to define faltering, which may not be
appropriate for all populations. In this article, we propose to assess
faltering via minimum random slopes (MRS) derived from a piecewise linear mixed
model. When used in conjunction with mixture model-based classification, MRS
provides a viable method for identifying children that have faltered, without
being dependent upon arbitrary standards. We illustrate our work via a
simulation study and apply it to a case study based on a birth cohort within

A
popular way to characterize a graph class is to list a minimal set of forbidden
induced subgraphs. Unfortunately this strategy usually does not lead to an
efficient recognition algorithm. On the other hand, many graph classes can be
efficiently recognized by techniques based on some interesting orderings of the
nodes, such as the ones given by traversals.
  We study specifically graph classes that have an ordering avoiding some
ordered structures. More precisely, we consider what we call patterns on three
nodes, and the recognition complexity of the associated classes. In this
domain, there are two key previous works. Damashke started the study of the
classes defined by forbidden patterns, a set that contains interval, chordal
and bipartite graphs among others. On the algorithmic side, Hell, Mohar and
Rafiey proved that any class defined by a set of forbidden patterns can be
recognized in polynomial time. We improve on these two works, by characterizing
systematically all the classes defined sets of forbidden patterns (on three
nodes), and proving that among the 23 different classes (up to complementation)
that we find, 21 can actually be recognized in linear time.
  Beyond this result, we consider that this type of characterization is very
useful, leads to a rich structure of classes, and generates a lot of open
questions worth investigating.

Exploiting this structure, several approaches have been proposed for low

the joint design is complicated and inappropriate for hardware implementation.
In this paper, we define the concept of GFDM-based linear receivers, which
first performs channel equalization (CEq) and afterwards the equalized signal
is processed with GFDM demodulator. We show that the optimal joint LMMSE
receiver is equivalent to a GFDM-based one, that applies LMMSE-CEq and
zero-forcing demodulation. For orthogonal modulation, the optimal LMMSE
receiver has an implementation-friendly structure. For the non-orthogonal case,
we propose two practical designs that approach the performance of the joint
LMMSE. Finally, we analytically prove that GFDM-based receivers achieve equal

progressively obtained by combining simpler ones. A recent trend in speech and
speaker recognition consists in discovering these representations starting from
raw audio samples directly. Differently from standard hand-crafted features
such as MFCCs or FBANK, the raw waveform can potentially help neural networks
discover better and more customized representations. The high-dimensional raw
inputs, however, can make training significantly more challenging. This paper
summarizes our recent efforts to develop a neural architecture that efficiently
processes speech from audio waveforms. In particular, we propose SincNet, a
novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that encourages the first layer to
discover meaningful filters by exploiting parametrized sinc functions. In
contrast to standard CNNs, which learn all the elements of each filter, only
low and high cutoff frequencies of band-pass filters are directly learned from
data. This inductive bias offers a very compact way to derive a customized
front-end, that only depends on some parameters with a clear physical meaning.
Our experiments, conducted on both speaker and speech recognition, show that
the proposed architecture converges faster, performs better, and is more
computationally efficient than standard CNNs.

mixture models are a popular class of clustering methods, that offers a
principled statistical approach to clustering. However, the underlying
assumption, that every mixing component is normally distributed, can often be
too rigid for several real life datasets. In order to to relax the assumption
about the normality of mixing components, a new class of parametric mixture
models that are based on Copula functions - Gaussian Mixuture Copula Models
were introduced. Estimating the parameters of the proposed Gaussian Mixture
Copula Model (GMCM) through maximum likelihood has been intractable due to the
positive semi-positive-definite constraints on the variance-covariance
matrices. Previous attempts were limited to maximizing a proxy-likelihood which
can be maximized using EM algorithm. These existing methods, even though easier
to implement, does not guarantee any convergence nor monotonic increase of the
GMCM Likelihood. In this paper, we use automatic differentiation tools to
maximize the exact likelihood of GMCM, at the same time avoiding any constraint
equations or Lagrange multipliers. We show how our method leads a monotonic
increase in likelihood and converges to a (local) optimum value of likelihood.
  In this paper, we also show how Automatic Differentiation can be used for
inference with Mixture of Factor Analyzers and advantages of doing so. We also
discuss how this method also has all the properties such as monotonic increase
in likelihood and convergence to a local optimum.

an uncommon fracture mode, is not well described in terms of either damage
percolation or crack nucleation-and-growth. We show that in these systems,
incipient failure is accompanied by an increase in eigenvector localization and
a drop in topological dimension. We propose these two novel indicators as
possible candidates to monitor a system in the approach to failure. As such,
they provide alternatives to monitoring changes in the precursory avalanche
activity, which is often invoked as a candidate for failure prediction in

the context of hierarchical materials which exhibit scale-free avalanche
statistics even very far from the critical load.

Karame, Lucas Davi","Sereum: Protecting Existing Smart Contracts Against Re-Entrancy Attacks",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, a number of existing blockchain systems have witnessed major bugs
and vulnerabilities within smart contracts. Although the literature features a
number of proposals for securing smart contracts, these proposals mostly focus
on proving the correctness or absence of a certain type of vulnerability within
a contract, but cannot protect deployed (legacy) contracts from being
exploited. In this paper, we address this problem in the context of re-entrancy
exploits and propose a novel smart contract security technology, dubbed Sereum
(Secure Ethereum), which protects existing, deployed contracts against
re-entrancy attacks in a backwards compatible way based on run-time monitoring
and validation. Sereum does neither require any modification nor any semantic
knowledge of existing contracts. By means of implementation and evaluation
using the Ethereum blockchain, we show that Sereum covers the actual execution
flow of a smart contract to accurately detect and prevent attacks with a false
positive rate as small as 0.06% and with negligible run-time overhead. As a
by-product, we develop three advanced re-entrancy attacks to demonstrate the
limitations of existing offline vulnerability analysis tools.

choice for the accurate computation of linear and non-linear response
properties of materials from first principles. A notable advantage of DFPT over
alternative approaches is the possibility of treating incommensurate lattice
distortions with an arbitrary wavevector, ${\bf q}$, at essentially the same
computational cost as the lattice-periodic case. Here we show that ${\bf q}$
can be formally treated as a perturbation parameter, and used in conjunction
with established results of perturbation theory (e.g. the ""2n+1"" theorem) to
perform a long-wave expansion of an arbitrary response function in powers of
the wavevector components. This provides a powerful, general framework to
accessing a wide range of spatial dispersion effects that were formerly
difficult to calculate by means of first-principles electronic-structure
methods. In particular, the physical response to the spatial gradient of any
external field can now be calculated at negligible cost, by using the response
functions to $\mathit{uniform}$ perturbations (electric, magnetic or strain
fields) as the only input. We demonstrate our method by calculating the
flexoelectric and dynamical quadrupole tensors of selected crystalline
insulators and model systems.

web, words are being used to denote newer meanings, causing linguistic shift.
With the recent availability of large amounts of digitized texts, an automated
analysis of the evolution of language has become possible. Our study mainly
focuses on improving the detection of new word senses. This paper presents a
unique proposal based on network features to improve the precision of new word
sense detection. For a candidate word where a new sense (birth) has been
detected by comparing the sense clusters induced at two different time points,
we further compare the network properties of the subgraphs induced from novel
sense cluster across these two time points. Using the mean fractional change in
edge density, structural similarity and average path length as features in an
SVM classifier, manual evaluation gives precision values of 0.86 and 0.74 for
the task of new sense detection, when tested on 2 distinct time-point pairs, in
comparison to the precision values in the range of 0.23-0.32, when the proposed
scheme is not used. The outlined method can therefore be used as a new post-hoc
step to improve the precision of novel word sense detection in a robust and
reliable way where the underlying framework uses a graph structure. Another
important observation is that even though our proposal is a post-hoc step, it
can be used in isolation and that itself results in a very decent performance
achieving a precision of 0.54-0.62. Finally, we show that our method is able to
detect the well-known historical shifts in 80% cases.

J. Mech. B/Fluids 28, 541-557 (2009)]. The asymptotic expansions for small
Reynolds numbers of these two models, compared to the exact solution obtained
from the lubrication approach, reveal some quantitative difference, even at
higher Reynolds numbers. Qualitatively, the two models give similar results at
least at a linear level. It is shown that for relatively low membrane tension
(T), there are distinct regions in the (T,R) parameter space where steady
bifurcating flows may occur. These flows can also be observed at vanishingly
small Reynolds numbers combined with relatively high membrane tension. At
sufficiently high T and R, the bifurcating flow is rather time periodic. A
weakly nonlinear analysis is then performed in both cases leading to the
derivation of evolution equations for the amplitudes of the bifurcating flows.
The amplitude equations show that the saddle node bifurcation has a
transcritical character while the Hopf bifurcation is either subcritical or
supercritical, depending both on the mode number and membrane tension.

While multi-wavelength data during the neutrino flare are sparse, the large

rays. We illustrate that two to five neutrino events during the flare can be
explained with leptohadronic models of different categories: a one-zone model,
a compact core model, and an external radiation field model. If, however,
significantly more events were to be accommodated, the predicted
multi-wavelength emission levels would be in conflict with observational X-ray
constraints, or with the high-energy gamma ray fluxes observed by the Fermi
LAT, depending on the model. For example, while the external radiation field
model can predict up to five neutrino events without violating X-ray
constraints, the absorption of high-energy gamma rays is in minor tension with

be derived from a variational principle. The nonlinear secular theory describes
the slow evolution of a continuous set of nested elliptical orbits as a result
of the pressure in a thin disc. In the artificial but widely considered case of
a 2D disc, the hydrodynamic Hamiltonian is just the orbit-averaged internal
energy of the disc, which can be determined from its eccentricity distribution
using the geometry of the elliptical orbits. In the realistic case of a 3D
disc, the Hamiltonian needs to be modified to take into account the dynamical
vertical structure of the disc. The simplest solutions of the theory are
uniformly precessing nonlinear eccentric modes, which make the energy
stationary subject to the angular momentum being fixed. We present numerical
examples of nonlinear eccentric modes up to their limiting amplitudes. Although
it lacks dissipation, which is important in many astrophysical contexts, this
formalism allows a simpler theoretical approach to the nonlinear dynamics of
eccentric discs than that derived from stress integrals, and also connects
better with established methods of celestial mechanics for cases in which the
disc interacts gravitationally with one or more orbital companion.

patterns are derived first, and are projected on the assumed surface to
calculate the achievable number of streams and the resulting channel capacity.

accelerated acquisitions. It operates on the complex data resulting from a
sensitivity encoding reconstruction, where asymptotically optimal signal
recovery guarantees can be attained by modeling the noise propagation in the
reconstruction and subsequently simulating or calculating the limit singular
value spectrum. Simple strategies are presented to deal with phase
inconsistencies and optimize patch construction. The pertinence of our
contributions is quantitatively validated on synthetic data, an in vivo adult
example, and challenging neonatal and fetal cohorts. Our methodology is
compared with related approaches, which generally operate on magnitude-only
data and use data-based noise level estimation and singular value truncation.
Visual examples are provided to illustrate effectiveness in generating denoised

  Architecture","8th Workshop on Irregular Applications: Architectures and Algorithms
  (IA^3) 2018",,,,"cs.DC cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Achieving high performance for sparse applications is challenging due to
irregular access patterns and weak locality. These properties preclude many
static optimizations and degrade cache performance on traditional systems. To
address these challenges, novel systems such as the Emu architecture have been
proposed. The Emu design uses light-weight migratory threads, narrow memory,
and near-memory processing capabilities to address weak locality and reduce the
total load on the memory system. Because the Emu architecture is fundamentally
different than cache based hierarchical memory systems, it is crucial to
understand the cost-benefit tradeoffs of standard sparse algorithm
optimizations on Emu hardware. In this work, we explore sparse matrix-vector
multiplication (SpMV) on the Emu architecture. We investigate the effects of
different sparse optimizations such as dense vector data layouts, work
distributions, and matrix reorderings. Our study finds that initially
distributing work evenly across the system is inadequate to maintain load
balancing over time due to the migratory nature of Emu threads. In severe
cases, matrix sparsity patterns produce hot-spots as many migratory threads
converge on a single resource. We demonstrate that known matrix reordering
techniques can improve SpMV performance on the Emu architecture by as much as
70% by encouraging more consistent load balancing. This can be compared with a
performance gain of no more than 16% on a cache-memory based system.

dimension, we focus on the two-dimensional case and obtain a perturbative

the chemical potentials of the non-equilibrium systems in contact from the
knowledge of the stationary probability distribution of the whole system

potential in non-equilibrium systems in contact--- we generically find that the
chemical potential lacks an equation of state, in the sense that it depends on
the detailed shape of the potential energy barrier separating the compartments

reminiscent of the properties of the mechanical pressure in active systems. We
also argue that the Maxwell relation is no longer valid and cannot be used to
infer the nonequilibrium chemical potential from the knowledge of the

that the (submodular) objective set-function is only partially known by agents,

amount of computation could be done in a sequential way using memristor current
spikes (d.c. response). As these spikes are found in many memristors (possibly
all), this novel approach could be highly useful for fast and reproducible
memristor circuits. However, questions were raised as to whether these spikes
were actually due to memristance or merely capacitance in the circuit. In this
longer version of the Faraday Discussion response, as much information as is
available from both published and unpublished data from my lab is marshalled
together. We find that the devices are likely imperfect memristors with some
capacitance, and that the spikes are related to the frequency effect seen in
memristor hysteresis curves, thus are an integral part of memristance.

correlations, studied with massless non-interacting biphotons emanating from
EPR-Bell-Bohm single-occupancy sources, corresponds to a distinct contribution
in the total second-order momentum correlations of the massive, interacting,
and time-evolving ultracold atoms. This single-occupancy contribution can be
extracted from the total second-order momentum correlation function measured in
time-of-flight experiments, which for the trapped atomic system contains, in
general, a double-occupancy, NOON, component. The dynamics of the two-particle
system are modeled by a Hubbard Hamiltonian. This partial coincidence spectrum
is a cosine-square quantum beating dependent on the difference of the momenta
of the two particles, while the corresponding coincidence probability proper,
familiar from its role in describing the Hong-Ou-Mandel coincidence dip of
overlapping photons, results from an integration over the particle momenta.
Because the second-order momentum correlations are mirrored in the
time-of-flight spectra in space, our theoretical findings provide impetus for
time-of-flight experimental protocols for emulating with (massive) ultracold

entangled (massless) photons or double-slit optical sources. The implementation
of such developments will facilitate testing of fundamental aspects and enable

are homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. Unfortunately,
neither of these techniques is applicable to the training of large neural
networks due to their large computational and communication overheads. As a
scalable technique for shared model governance, we propose splitting deep
learning model between multiple parties. This paper empirically investigates
the security guarantee of this technique, which is introduced as the problem of
model completion: Given the entire training data set or an environment
simulator, and a subset of the parameters of a trained deep learning model, how
much training is required to recover the model's original performance? We
define a metric for evaluating the hardness of the model completion problem and
study it empirically in both supervised learning on ImageNet and reinforcement
learning on Atari and DeepMind~Lab. Our experiments show that (1) the model
completion problem is harder in reinforcement learning than in supervised
learning because of the unavailability of the trained agent's trajectories, and
(2) its hardness depends not primarily on the number of parameters of the
missing part, but more so on their type and location. Our results suggest that
model splitting might be a feasible technique for shared model governance in
some settings where training is very expensive.

less than 0.5 at system convergence for layers that do not employ skip

single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) are examined using two
dimensional fully compressible wavelet-based direct numerical simulations. The
simulations model low Atwood number ($A=0.04$) RTI development for four
different stratification strengths, corresponding to Mach numbers from 0.3
(weakly stratified) to 1.2 (strongly stratified), and for three different
perturbation Reynolds numbers, from 5,000 to 20,000. All simulations use
adaptive wavelet-based mesh refinement to achieve very fine spatial resolutions
at relatively low computational cost. For all stratifications, the bubble and
spike go through the exponential growth regime, followed by a slowing of the
RTI evolution. For the weakest stratification, this slow-down is then followed
by a re-acceleration, while for stronger stratifications the suppression of RTI
growth continues. Bubble and spike asymmetries are observed for weak
stratifications, with bubble and spike growth rates becoming increasingly
similar as the stratification strength increases. For the range of cases
studied, there is relatively little effect of Reynolds number on bubble and
spike heights, although the formation of secondary vortices becomes more
pronounced as Reynolds number increases. The underlying dynamics are analyzed
in detail through an examination of the vorticity transport equation, revealing
that incompressible baroclinicity drives RTI growth for small and moderate
stratifications, but increasingly leads to the suppression of vorticity
production and RTI growth for stronger stratifications. These variations in
baroclinicity are used to explain the suppression of RTI growth for strong
stratifications, as well as the anomalous asymmetry in bubble and spike growth
rates for weak stratifications.

numerically solving the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation~(TDSE) of
hydrogen. It is found that the inclusion of nondipole corrections in the TDSE
can induce momentum shifts of photoelectrons in the opposite direction of the
laser propagation. The magnitude of the momentum shift is roughly proportional
to the laser peak intensity and to the momentum component of the photoelectron
along the laser propagation. By including the nondipole corrections of the
Volkov phase into a semi-analytical model previously developed under the dipole
approximation, all the main features of the momentum shifts can be nicely
reproduced. Through an analytic expression, the origin of such momentum shifts
is attributed to the nondipole phase difference between the two electron wave
packets ejected in the rising edge and the falling edge, which will interfere
with each other and result in the final fringe pattern. One important
consequence of such momentum shifts is that they can smooth out the peak
splitting induced by the dynamic interference in the photoelectron energy
spectrum. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that the dynamic interference
persists in the photoelectron momentum distributions and is not suppressed at
all for the laser parameters considered in this work.

eliminates all foundational problems of quantum mechanics. The key advance is
the completion of Hamiltonian mechanics to the universal mechanics of particles
based on action-waves, consistent with the inclusive validity of the principle
of stationary action. It is found that irreducible indeterminism is intrinsic
and universal at all scales of dynamics. The new action-wave equation is the
complete description of single dynamical histories, dissolving the
classical-quantum divide. The statistical theory of quantum mechanics emerges
as the ensemble average of modified action dynamics. The ensemble average of
the new action mechanics leads to a hybrid function consisting of the
action-waves and the probability density of the ensemble. This hybrid
wavefunction obeys the Schr\""odinger equation, which is not a single particle
dynamical equation. The reconstructed mechanics without matter waves is free of
the cardinal problem known as the collapse of the wavefunction and with that,
the vexing issue of quantum measurement is resolved. Another significant
advance is the correct decoding of quantum entanglement and purging of
nonseparability and nonlocality in quantum correlations. The action-waves do
not carry the burden of divergent zero-point energy. The reconstructed
mechanics is in complete agreement with all empirical requirements and in
harmony with credible physical ontology.

simulations, methods that are both real-time and accurate are still an open
challenge. An ideal, interactive solver would be able to provide physically and
numerically accurate results at high frame rate, which requires efficient force
computation and time integration. Towards this goal, we explore in this paper
for the first time the use of neural networks to directly learn the underlying
biomechanics. Given a 3D mesh of a soft tissue segmented from medical images,
we train a neural network to predict vertex-wise accelerations for a large time
step based on the current state of the system. The model is trained using the
deformation of a bar under torsion, and evaluated on different motions,
geometries, and hyperelastic material models. For predictions of ten times the
original time step we observed a mean error of 0.017mm $\pm$ 0.014 (0.032) at a
mesh size of 50mm x 50mm x 100mm. Predictions at 20dt yield an error of 2.10mm
$\pm$ 1.73 (4.37) and by further increasing the prediction time step the
maximum error rises to 38.3mm due to an artificial stiffening. In all
experiments our proposed method stayed stable, while the reference solver fails
to converge. Our experiments suggest that it is possible to directly learn the
mechanical simulation and open further investigations for the direct
application of machine learning to speed-up biophysics solvers.

adaptations--including behavior and technology--that are socially rather than
sexually transmitted. This chapter synthesizes research from anthropology,
psychology, archaeology, and agent-based modeling into a speculative yet
coherent account of two fundamental cognitive transitions underlying human
cultural evolution that is consistent with contemporary psychology. While the
chapter overlaps with a more technical paper on this topic (Gabora & Smith
2018), it incorporates new research and elaborates a genetic component to our
overall argument. The ideas in this chapter grew out of a non-Darwinian
framework for cultural evolution, referred to as the Self-other Reorganization
(SOR) theory of cultural evolution (Gabora, 2013, in press; Smith, 2013), which
was inspired by research on the origin and earliest stage in the evolution of
life (Cornish-Bowden & C\'ardenas 2017; Goldenfeld, Biancalani, & Jafarpour,
2017, Vetsigian, Woese, & Goldenfeld 2006; Woese, 2002). SOR bridges
psychological research on fundamental aspects of our human nature such as
creativity and our proclivity to reflect on ideas from different perspectives,
with the literature on evolutionary approaches to cultural evolution that
aspire to synthesize the behavioral sciences much as has been done for the
biological scientists. The current chapter is complementary to this effort, but
less abstract; it attempts to ground the theory of cultural evolution in terms
of cognitive transitions as suggested by archaeological evidence.

provided that the manifold is simply-connected and has dimension $n\geq 5$.
Examples of tangential structures such that the spaces of subsurface with that
tangential structure satisfy homological stability are framings or spin
structures of their tangent bundle, or $k$-frames of the normal bundle provided
that $k\leq n-2$.
  Furthermore we introduce spaces of pointedly embedded subsurfaces and
construct stabilization maps, as well as prove homological stability for these.
This is used to prove homological stability for spaces of symplectic
subsurfaces.

$m_{\eta^{\prime}}$ decreases from its vacuum value by 220 MeV near T=176 MeV
after the chiral transition ($T_{c}^{\chi}=154.9$ MeV).This is similar to the
$\eta^{\prime}$ in-medium mass drop of at least 200 MeV as reported by Csorgo

The pseudoscalar mixing angle $\theta_p$ achieves anti-ideal mixing in the
influence of c(T). The $\eta $ meson becomes light quark system ($ \eta_{NS} $)
at T=176 MeV and changes its identity with $ \eta' $ meson which becomes
strange quark system ($ \eta_{S} $). The degenerated temperature variations of
$\sigma$, $\pi$ meson masses merges with the temperature variations of the
masses of degenerated $a_{0}$, $\eta$ mesons near 275 MeV. It means that for
c(T) when $m_{\sigma}=400$ MeV, the $U_{A}(1)$ restoration takes place at 1.75

a distant observer? It depends on the black hole highlighting by the
surrounding hot matter. The black hole shadow (the photon capture
cross-section) would be viewed if there is a stationary luminous background.
The black hole event horizon is invisible directly (per se). Nevertheless, a
more compact (with respect to black hole shadow) projection of the black hole
event horizon on the celestial sphere may be reconstructed by detecting the
highly red-shifted photons emitted by the non-stationary luminous matter
plunging into the black hole and approaching to the event horizon. It is
appropriate to call this reconstructed projection of the event horizon on the
celestial sphere for a distant observer as the ``lensed event horizon image'',
or simply the ``event horizon image''. This event horizon image is placed on
the celestial sphere within the position of black hole shadow. Amazingly, the
event horizon image is a gravitationally lensed projection on the celestial
sphere of the whole surface of the event horizon globe. In result, the black
holes may be viewed at once from both the front and back sides. The lensed
event horizon image may be considered as a genuine silhouette of the black
hole. For example, a dark northern hemisphere of the event horizon image is the
simplest model for a black hole silhouette in the presence of a thin accretion
disk.

permit analytical evaluation of the scalar modes near the bounce, with the aid
of techniques which we had used in our earlier work, we compute the scalar and
the tensor power spectra numerically. For appropriate values of the additional

multi-label classification. Rules are able to expose label dependencies such as
implications, subsumptions or exclusions in a human-comprehensible and
interpretable manner. However, the induction of rules with multiple labels in
the head is particularly challenging, as the number of label combinations which
must be taken into account for each rule grows exponentially with the number of
available labels. To overcome this limitation, algorithms for exhaustive rule
mining typically use properties such as anti-monotonicity or decomposability in
order to prune the search space. In the present paper, we examine whether
commonly used multi-label evaluation metrics satisfy these properties and
therefore are suited to prune the search space for multi-label heads.

unknown, a phenomenological approach ($q$-theory) has been proposed to describe
the vacuum degrees of freedom and the dynamics of the vacuum energy after the
Big Bang. The original $q$-theory was based on a four-form field strength from
a three-form gauge potential. However, this realization of $q$-theory, just as
others suggested so far, is rather artificial and does not take into account
the fermionic nature of the vacuum. We now propose a more physical realization
of the $q$-variable. In this approach, we assume that the vacuum has the
properties of a plastic (malleable) fermionic crystalline medium. The new
approach unites general relativity and fermionic microscopic (trans-Planckian)
degrees of freedom, as the approach involves both the tetrad of standard
gravity and the elasticity tetrad of the hypothetical vacuum crystal. This
approach also allows for the description of possible topological phases of the
quantum vacuum.

gravitational mass and energy gradient of several particles in the external
ultra-strong magnetic fields. J. C. Maxwell was the first to introduce the
algebra of quaternions to study the physical properties of electromagnetic
fields. Some scholars follow up this method in the field theories. Nowadays,
they employ the complex-octonions to analyze simultaneously the physical
quantities of electromagnetic and gravitational fields, including the field
potential, field strength, field source, linear momentum, angular momentum,
torque, and force. When the octonion force is equal to zero, it is able to
deduce eight independent equilibrium equations, especially the force
equilibrium equation, precession equilibrium equation, mass continuity
equation, and current continuity equation. In the force equilibrium equation,
the gravitational mass is variable. The gravitational mass is the sum of the
inertial mass and a few tiny terms. These tiny terms will be varied with not
only the fluctuation of field strength and of potential energy, but also the
spatial dimension of velocity. The study reveals that it is comparatively
untoward to attempt to measure directly the variation of these tiny terms of
gravitational mass in the ultra-strong magnetic field. However it is not such
difficult to measure the energy gradient relevant to the variation of these
tiny terms of gravitational mass. In the complex-octonion space, the
gravitational mass is a sort of variable physical quantity, rather than an
intrinsic property of any physical object. And this inference is accordant with
the academic thought of `the mass is not an intrinsic property any more' in the
unified electro-weak theory.

thorough theoretical analysis is largely missing but desirable. We show that
the method can yield non-hyperbolic moment systems if the distribution function

restrictions with time window constraints for the latest maintenance
operations. Several constructive matheuristics and a Variable Neighborhood
Descent local search are designed. The matheuristics are shown to be accurately
effective for medium and large size instances. The matheuristics give also
results on the design of MILP formulations and neighborhoods for the problem.
Contributions for the operational applications are also discussed. It is shown
that the restriction of time windows, which was used to ease computations,
induces large over-costs and that this restriction is not required anymore with
the capabilities of matheuristics or local search to solve such size of

magnetic structure factor, $S ( k )$ at $T$ = 1.00, which appears to be the
temperature at which small jumps in the magnetization per spin and the energy
per spin occur. The magnetization jump per spin scales with size roughly as
$L^{- 3/4}$, while the energy jump per spin scales like $L^{- 3/2}$. The
results also indicate the existence of an approximately logarithmic divergence
of $S ( k )$ as $k \to 0$. The magnetic susceptibility, $\chi (\vec{\bf k} = 0
)$, on the other hand, seems to have a value of about 14.2 under these
conditions. This suggests the absence of a ferromagnetic phase, and that the
lower critical dimension for long-range order in this model is three. Similar
results are found for $L$ = 64 samples at $h_r$ = 2.0 and $T$ = 0.875. We
expect that the behavior is qualitatively similar along the entire phase

quantify as bias, this commonly-used approach can introduce non-relevant
concepts into bias measurement. We propose an alternative approach to bias
measurement utilizing the smoothed first-order co-occurrence relations between
the word and the representative concept words, which we derive by
reconstructing the co-occurrence estimates inherent in word embedding models.
We compare these approaches by conducting several experiments on the scenario
of measuring gender bias of occupational words, according to an English

gender bias with the actual gender bias statistics of the U.S. job market - on

  Considering Two-Way Shape Memory Effect and Transformation-Induced Plasticity",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shape memory alloys (SMAs) have been intensively investigated as actuators
for the past several decades. Due to their high actuation energy density
compared to other active materials, their current and potential applications in
engineering fields are expanding rapidly. Prior to being used as actuators,
SMAs are usually subjected to a training process to stabilize their behavior.
During the training process, permanent changes are introduced in the
microstructure of the material which results in the generation of internal
stresses and a large amount of irrecoverable Transformation Induced Plastic
strain (TRIP). The generated internal stresses along with a potential thermal
loading provide the driving force to induce the oriented phase transformation
so that the SMA-based actuators are able to exhibit the Two-Way Shape Memory
Effect (TWSME) without applying external bias load. To predict this intrinsic
phenomenon, a three-dimensional phenomenological constitutive model for
untrained SMAs is presented. The proposed model utilizes the martensitic volume
fraction, transformation strain, TRIP strain, and internal stress as internal
state variables so that it is able to account for the evolution of TRIP strain
and the TWSME for untrained SMAs under cyclic thermomechanical loading
conditions. In the end, boundary value problems considering an untrained SMA
material under isothermal/isobaric cyclic loading are solved and the predicted
cyclic response is compared against available experimental data to demonstrate
the proposed capabilities.

cellular structures with the grain assembly separated by a network of grain
boundaries, including metals and ceramics. However, the underlying mechanism of
grain growth has remained ambiguous for more than 60 years. The models for
grain growth, based on the classically linear relationship between the grain
boundary migration and capillary driving force, generally predict normal grain
growth. Quantitative model for abnormal grain growth is lacking despite decades
of efforts. Here, we present a unified model to reveal quantitatively how grain
growth evolves, which predicts the normal, abnormal and stagnant behaviors of
grain growth in polycrystalline materials. Our model indicates that the
relationship between grain boundary migration and capillary driving force is
generally nonlinear, but will switch to be the classically linear relationship
in a specific case. Furthermore, the grain growth experiments observed in
polycrystalline SrTiO3 demonstrates the validity of the unified model. Our
study provides a unified, quantitative model to understand and predict grain
growth in polycrystalline materials, and thus offers helpful guides for the
microstructural design to optimize the properties of polycrystalline materials.

\}_{n\geq0}$ of monic orthogonal polynomials and a fixed integer $k$, we
establish necessary and sufficient conditions so that the quasi-orthogonal
polynomials $\left \{ Q_{n}\right \}_{n\geq0}$ defined by \[ Q_{n}(x) =P_{n}(x)
+ \sum \limits_{i=1}^{k-1} b_{i,n}P_{n-i}(x), \ \ n\geq 0, \] with $b_{i,n} \in
\mathbb{R}$, and $b_{k-1,n}\neq 0$ for $n\geq k-1$, also constitute a sequence
of orthogonal polynomials. Therefore we solve the inverse problem for linearly
related orthogonal polynomials. The characterization turns out to be equivalent
to some nice recurrence formulas for the coefficients $b_{i,n}$. We employ
these results to establish explicit relations between various types of
quadrature rules from the above relations. A number of illustrative examples
are provided.

massive, customized production. They consist of a base of reusable artifacts
and points of variation that provide the system with flexibility, allowing
generating customized products. However, maintaining a system with such
complexity and flexibility could be error prone and time consuming. Indeed, any
modification (addition, deletion or update) at the level of a product or an
artifact would impact other elements. It would therefore be interesting to
adopt an efficient and organized traceability solution to maintain the Software
Product Line. Still, traceability is not systematically implemented. It is
usually set up for specific constraints (e.g. certification requirements), but
abandoned in other situations. In order to draw a picture of the actual
conditions of traceability solutions in Software Product Lines context, we
decided to address a literature review. This review as well as its findings is
detailed in the present article.

and has plagued the sensor community for many years. In this paper, we propose
a sensor drift correction method to deal with the sensor drift problem.
Specifically, we propose a discriminative subspace projection approach for
sensor drift reduction in electronic noses. The proposed method inherits the
merits of the subspace projection method called domain regularized component
analysis. Moreover, the proposed method takes the source data label information
into consideration, which minimizes the within-class variance of the projected
source samples and at the same time maximizes the between-class variance. The
label information is exploited to avoid overlapping of samples with different
labels in the subspace. Experiments on two sensor drift datasets have shown the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

parallel loops. Loop scheduling techniques aim to achieve load balanced
executions of such applications. For distributed-memory systems, existing
dynamic loop scheduling (DLS) libraries are typically MPI-based, and employ a
master-worker execution model to assign variably-sized chunks of loop
iterations. The master-worker execution model may adversely impact performance
due to the master-level contention. This work proposes a distributed
chunk-calculation approach that does not require the master-worker execution
scheme. Moreover, it considers the novel features in the latest MPI standards,
such as passive-target remote memory access, shared-memory window creation, and
atomic read-modify-write operations. To evaluate the proposed approach, five
well-known DLS techniques, two applications, and two heterogeneous hardware
setups have been considered. The DLS techniques implemented using the proposed
approach outperformed their counterparts implemented using the traditional
master-worker execution model.

building blocks towards developing a contextual dialogue system responsible for
handling certain vehicle-passenger interactions in autonomous vehicles (AV).
When the passengers give instructions to AMIE (Automated-vehicle Multimodal
In-cabin Experience), the agent should parse such commands properly and trigger
the appropriate functionality of the AV system. In our AMIE scenarios, we
describe usages and support various natural commands for interacting with the
vehicle. We collected a multimodal in-cabin data-set with multi-turn dialogues
between the passengers and AMIE using a Wizard-of-Oz scheme. We explored
various recent Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based techniques and built our
own hierarchical models to recognize passenger intents along with relevant
slots associated with the action to be performed in AV scenarios. Our
experimental results achieved F1-score of 0.91 on utterance-level intent

the initial version of the Autopilot system. This system promised to provide
semi-autonomous driving using the existing hardware already installed on Tesla
vehicles. On March 23rd, 2018, a Tesla vehicle ran into a divider at highway
speed, killing the driver. This occurred under the control of the Autopilot
system with no driver intervention. Critics argue that though Tesla gives
drivers warnings in its owner's manual, it is ultimately unethical to release a
system that is marketed as an Autopilot yet still makes grave mistakes that any
human driver would not make. Others defend Tesla by stating that their
advisories are suitable and that drivers should ultimately be at fault for any
mistakes of the Autopilot. This paper will scrutinize the ethical implications
of Tesla's choice to develop, market, and ship a beta product that requires
extensive testing. It will further analyze the implications of Tesla's
aggressive advertisement of the product under the name Autopilot along with
associated marketing materials. By applying the joint ACM/IEEE-CS Software
Engineering Code of Ethics, this paper will show that Tesla's choices and
actions during this event are inconsistent with the code and are unethical
since they are responsible for adequately testing and honestly marketing their
product.

empower type 1 diabetes (T1D) management. Most of these algorithms only account
for input such as glucose, insulin and carbohydrate, which limits their
performance. Here, we present a novel glucose prediction algorithm which, in
addition to standard inputs, accounts for meal absorption and physical exercise
information to enhance prediction accuracy. Methods: a compartmental model of
glucose-insulin dynamics combined with a deconvolution technique for state
estimation is employed for glucose prediction. In silico data corresponding
from the 10 adult subjects of UVa-Padova simulator, and clinical data from 10
adults with T1D were used. Finally, a comparison against a validated glucose
prediction algorithm based on a latent variable with exogenous input (LVX)
model is provided. Results: For a prediction horizon of 60 minutes, accounting
for meal absorption and physical exercise improved glucose forecasting
accuracy. In particular, root mean square error (mg/dL) went from 26.68 to
23.89, p<0.001 (in silico data); and from 37.02 to 35.96, p<0.001 (clinical
data - only meal information). Such improvement in accuracy was translated into
significant improvements on hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia prediction.
Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is statistically superior to
that of the LVX algorithm (26.68 vs. 32.80, p<0.001 (in silico data); 37.02 vs.
49.17, p<0.01 (clinical data). Conclusion: Taking into account meal absorption
and physical exercise information improves glucose prediction accuracy.
