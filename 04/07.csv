analysis and mathematical definition of corruption when entering into a
contract between principal agent and producers. The formulation of the problem
and the definition of concepts for the general case are considered. For
definiteness, all calculations and formulas are given for the case of three
producers, one principal agent and one intermediary. Economic analysis of
corruption allowed building a mathematical model of interaction between agents.
Financial resources distribution problem in a contract with a corrupted
intermediary is considered.Then proposed conditions for corruption emergence
and its possible consequences. Optimal non-corruption schemes of financial
resources distribution in a contract are formed, when principal agent's choice
is limited first only by asymmetrical information and then also by external
influences.Numerical examples suggesting optimal corruption-free agents'
behaviour are presented.

  Treatment Strategies",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Often in follow-up studies intermediate events occur in some patients, such
as reinterventions or adverse events. These intermediate events directly affect
the shapes of their longitudinal profiles. Our work is motivated by two studies
in which such intermediate events have been recorded during follow-up. The
first study concerns Congenital Heart Diseased patients who were followed-up
echocardiographically, with several patients undergoing reintervention. The
second study concerns patients who participated in the SPRINT study and
experienced adverse events during follow-up. We are interested in the change of
the longitudinal profiles after the occurrence of the intermediate event and in
utilizing this information to improve the accuracy of the dynamic prediction
for their risk.
  To achieve this, we propose a flexible joint modeling framework for the
longitudinal and survival data that includes the intermediate event as a
time-varying binary covariate in both the longitudinal and survival submodels.
We consider a set of joint models that postulate different effects of the
intermediate event in the longitudinal profile and the risk of the clinical
endpoint, with different formulations for their association while allowing its
parametrization to change after the occurrence of the intermediate event. Based
on these models we derive dynamic predictions of conditional survival
probabilities which are adaptive to different scenarios with respect to the
occurrence of the intermediate event. We evaluate the accuracy of these
predictions with a simulation study using the time-dependent area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve and the expected prediction error
adjusted to our setting. The results suggest that accounting for the changes in
the longitudinal profiles and the instantaneous risk for the clinical endpoint
is important, and improves the accuracy of the dynamic predictions.

a 120-meter long free-space link between the rooftops of two buildings and show
that both the rotation speed and the rotational symmetry of objects can be
identified from the detected rotational Doppler frequency shift signal at
photon count level. Effects of possible slight misalignments and atmospheric
turbulences are quantitatively analyzed in terms of mode power spreading to the
adjacent modes as well as the transfer of rotational frequency shifts.
Moreover, our results demonstrate that with the preknowledge of the object's
rotational symmetry one may always deduce the rotation speed no matter how
strong the coupling to neighboring modes is. Without any information of the
rotating object, the deduction of the object's symmetry and rotational speed
may still be obtained as long as the mode spreading efficiency does not exceed
50 %. Our work supports the feasibility of a practical sensor to remotely

consist of power series or functionals of the solution variables. Thereby, the
exploitation of symbolic algebra to express a given DGFEM approximation of a
PDE problem within a high level language, whose syntax closely resembles the
mathematical definition, is an invaluable tool. Indeed, this then facilitates
the automatic assembly of the resulting system of (nonlinear) equations, as
well as the computation of Fr\'echet derivative(s) of the DGFEM scheme, needed,
for example, within a Newton-type solver. However, even exploiting symbolic
algebra, the discretisation of coupled systems of PDEs can still be extremely
verbose and hard to debug. Thereby, in this article we develop a further layer
of abstraction by designing a class structure for the automatic computation of
DGFEM formulations. This work has been implemented within the FEniCS package,
based on exploiting the Unified Form Language. Numerical examples are presented
which highlight the simplicity of implementation of DGFEMs for the numerical

learn to communicate based on well-summarized features. In this work, we train
neural agents to simultaneously develop visual perception from raw image
pixels, and learn to communicate with a sequence of discrete symbols. The
agents play an image description game where the image contains factors such as
colors and shapes. We train the agents using the obverter technique where an
agent introspects to generate messages that maximize its own understanding.
Through qualitative analysis, visualization and a zero-shot test, we show that
the agents can develop, out of raw image pixels, a language with compositional
properties, given a proper pressure from the environment.

invariant solutions one quickly finds out how little can be done by pen and
paper. For flows on sufficiently simple domains and under sufficiently simple
boundary conditions, one may be able to predict the parameter values at which
the base flow becomes unstable and the basic properties of the secondary flow.
On more complicated domains and under more realistic boundary conditions, such
questions can usually only be addressed by numerical means. Moreover, for a
wide class of elementary parallel shear flows the base flow remains stable in
the presence of sustained turbulent motion. In such flows, secondary solutions
often appear with finite amplitude and completely unconnected to the base flow.
Only using techniques from computational dynamical systems can such behaviour
be explained. Many of these techniques, such as for the detection and
classification of bifurcations and for the continuation in parameters of
equilibria and time-periodic solutions, were developed in the late 1970s for
dynamical systems with few degrees of freedom. The application to fluid
dynamics or, to be more precise, to spatially discretized Navier-Stokes flow,
is far from straightforward. In this historical review chapter, we follow the

simulations and theories, we argue that the implosion conjecture is valid in
interpreting these events. Furthermore, distinct properties of the events allow
us to identify two physical categories of implosion. One type demonstrates a
rapid contraction at the beginning of the flare impulsive phase, as magnetic
free energy is removed rapidly by a filament eruption. The other type, which
has no visible eruption, shows a continuous loop shrinkage during the entire
flare impulsive phase which we suggest manifests the ongoing conversion of
magnetic free energy in a coronal volume. Corresponding scenarios are
described, which can provide reasonable explanations for the observations. We
also point out that implosions may be suppressed in cases when a
heavily-mass-loaded filament is involved, possibly serving as an alternative
account for their observational rarity.

disturbances, but the effects of their interaction with Earth's magnetic field
depend on their magnetic configuration and orientation. Fitting and
reconstruction techniques have been developed to determine the important
geometrical and physical CME properties. In many instances, there is
disagreement between such different methods but also between fitting from in
situ measurements and reconstruction based on remote imaging. Here, we compare
three methods based on different assumptions for measurements of thirteen CMEs
by the Wind spacecraft from 1997 to 2015. These CMEs are selected from the
interplanetary coronal mass ejections catalog on
https://wind.nasa.gov/ICMEindex.php due to their simplicity in terms of 1)
small expansion speed throughout the CME and 2) little asymmetry in the
magnetic field profile. This makes these thirteen events ideal candidates to
compare codes that do not include expansion nor distortion. We find that, for
these simple events, the codes are in relatively good agreement in terms of the
CME axis orientation for six out of the 13 events. Using the Grad-Shafranov
technique, we can determine the shape of the cross-section, which is assumed to
be circular for the other two models, a force-free fitting and a
circular-cylindrical non-force-free fitting. Five of the events are found to
have a clear circular cross-section, even when this is not a pre-condition of
the reconstruction. We make an initial attempt at evaluating the adequacy of
the different assumptions for these simple CMEs. The conclusion of this work
strongly suggests that attempts at reconciling in situ and remote-sensing views
of CMEs must take in consideration the compatibility of the different models
with specific CME structures to better reproduce flux ropes.

the radial drift of planetesimals and type I migration of planetary embryos in

performing N-body simulations of planetary embryos. We demonstrate that in the

drift in a magnetorotational instability (MRI)-inactive disk, in which the
pressure maximum is created, and accumulate in a narrow ring-like region with
an inner edge at ~ 0.7 au from the Sun. We also show that planetary embryos

I migration in the late stage of disk evolution. The origin of the localized

this correspondence is provided in the abelian case, as well as in terms of a

determining the dimensional reduction of the M5-brane theory on $S^3$. The

are necessary to explain current results, re-examine the existing data, and
propose new experiments. In this Letter, we present a modified version of the
$\mu\nu$SSM supersymmetric model where a non-Universal extra U(1) gauge
symmetry is added in order to restore an effective R-parity that ensures proton
stability. We show that anomalies equations cancel without having to add
\emph{any} exotic matter, restricting the charges of the fields under the extra
symmetry to a discrete set of values. We find that it is the viability of the
model through anomalies cancellation what defines the conditions in which
fermions interact with dark matter candidates via the exchange of $Z'$ bosons.
The strict condition of universality violation means that LHC constraints for a
$Z'$ mass do not apply directly to our model, allowing for a yet undiscovered
relatively light $Z$', as we discuss both in the phenomenological context and
in its implications for possible flavour changing neutral currents. Moreover,
we explore the possibility of isospin violating dark matter interactions; we
observe that this interaction depends, surprisingly, on the Higgs charges under
the new symmetry, both limiting the number of possible models and allowing to

light rays in space. Due to its property, one can compute the depth from light
fields in uncontrolled lighting environments, which is a big advantage over
active sensing devices. Depth computed from light fields can be used for many
applications including 3D modelling and refocusing. However, light field images
from hand-held cameras have very narrow baselines with noise, making the depth
estimation difficult. any approaches have been proposed to overcome these
limitations for the light field depth estimation, but there is a clear
trade-off between the accuracy and the speed in these methods. In this paper,
we introduce a fast and accurate light field depth estimation method based on a
fully-convolutional neural network. Our network is designed by considering the
light field geometry and we also overcome the lack of training data by
proposing light field specific data augmentation methods. We achieved the top
rank in the HCI 4D Light Field Benchmark on most metrics, and we also
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on real-world light-field
images.

as regular shapes, is a common and useful technique that helps programmers
detect incorrect program behaviors. This is specially true in dynamic languages
such as Prolog. However, such run-time checks inevitably introduce run-time
overhead (in execution time, memory, energy, etc.). Several approaches have
been proposed for reducing such overhead, such as eliminating the checks that
can statically be proved to always succeed, and/or optimizing the way in which
the (remaining) checks are performed. However, there are cases in which it is
not possible to remove all checks statically (e.g., open libraries which must
check their interfaces, complex properties, unknown code, etc.) and in which,
even after optimizations, these remaining checks still may introduce an
unacceptable level of overhead. It is thus important for programmers to be able
to determine the additional cost due to the run-time checks and compare it to
some notion of admissible cost. The common practice used for estimating
run-time checking overhead is profiling, which is not exhaustive by nature.
Instead, we propose a method that uses static analysis to estimate such
overhead, with the advantage that the estimations are functions parameterized
by input data sizes. Unlike profiling, this approach can provide guarantees for
all possible execution traces, and allows assessing how the overhead grows as
the size of the input grows. Our method also extends an existing assertion
verification framework to express ""admissible"" overheads, and statically and
automatically checks whether the instrumented program conforms with such
specifications. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of our approach
that suggests that our method is feasible and promising.

However, the experimentally measured thermal conductivity of BAs single

inconsistency, we investigated the lattice structure and potential defects in
BAs single crystals at atomic scale using aberration-corrected scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Rather than finding a large
concentration As vacancies ($V_\mathrm{As}$), as widely thought to dominate the
thermal resistance in BAs crystals, our STEM results showed enhanced intensity
of some B columns and reduced intensity of some As columns, suggesting the
presence of antisite defects with As$_\mathrm{B}$ (As-atom on B site) and
B$_\mathrm{As}$ (B-atom on As site) with significant concentrations. Further
calculations show that the antisite pair with As$_\mathrm{B}$ next to
B$_\mathrm{As}$ is preferred energetically among the different types of point
defects investigated, and confirm that such defects lower the thermal
conductivity for BAs. Using a concentration of
6.6$\pm$3$\times$10$^{20}$$\,$cm$^{-3}$ for the antisite pairs estimated from

65-100$\,$Wm$^{-1}$$\,$K$^{-1}$, in reasonable agreement with our measured

their $L$-groups. This conjecture can be seen as a special case of a more
general conjecture, which replaces reductive groups by spherical varieties and
the trace formula by its generalization, the relative trace formula.
  The goal of this article and its continuation is to demonstrate, by example,
the existence of ""transfer operators"" betweeen relative trace formulas, that
generalize the scalar transfer factors of endoscopy. These transfer operators
have all properties that one could expect from a trace formula comparison:
matching, fundamental lemma for the Hecke algebra, transfer of (relative)
characters. Most importantly, and quite surprisingly, they appear to be of
abelian nature (at least, in the low-rank examples considered in this paper),
even though they encompass functoriality relations of non-abelian harmonic
analysis. Thus, they are amenable to application of the Poisson summation
formula in order to perform the global comparison. Moreover, we show that these
abelian transforms have some structure --- which presently escapes our
understanding in its entirety --- as deformations of well-understood operators
when the spaces under consideration are replaced by their ""asymptotic cones"".
  In this first paper we study (relative) characters for the Kunzetsov formula

for $q=u,d,c,s$. This scenario is described within an effective field theory
(EFT) extension of the SM, for which a potential contribution of certain
dimension six effective operators to the light quarks Yukawa couplings is $y_q

pattern can be reconstructed within the DQCD through the non-perturbative meson
evolution from very low scales, where factorization of matrix elements is
valid, to scales of order $(1~GeV)$ with subsequent perturbative quark-gluon
evolution to $\mu=3~GeV$. This turns out to be possible in spite of a very
different pattern displayed at low scales with $B_2=1.2$, $B_3=3.0$, $B_4=1.0$

to an average of 2.7${\rm R_e}$. Combined with central stellar velocity
dispersions ($\sigma_0$) this provides the first determination of the dynamical
state of a sample selected by a lack of star formation activity at large

($M_{\star}>2\times10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$) generally show no or little rotation
measured at 5kpc ($|V_5|/\sigma_0<0.2$ in 8 of 10 cases), while ${\sim}64\%$ of
less massive galaxies show significant rotation. This is reminiscent of local
fast- and slow-rotating ellipticals and implies that low- and high-redshift
quiescent galaxies have qualitatively similar dynamical structures. We compare
$|V_5|/\sigma_0$ distributions at $z\sim0.8$ and the present day by re-binning
and smoothing the kinematic maps of 91 low-redshift quiescent galaxies from the
CALIFA survey and find evidence for a decrease in rotational support since
$z\sim1$. This result is especially strong when galaxies are compared at fixed
velocity dispersion; if velocity dispersion does not evolve for individual
galaxies then the rotational velocity at 5kpc was an average of ${94\pm22\%}$
higher in $z\sim0.8$ quiescent galaxies than today. Considering that the number
of quiescent galaxies grows with time and that new additions to the population
descend from rotationally-supported star-forming galaxies, our results imply
that quiescent galaxies must lose angular momentum between $z\sim1$ and the
present, presumably through dissipationless merging, and/or that the mechanism
that transforms star-forming galaxies also reduces their rotational support.

modelling, we show that sub-millimeter (sub-mm) luminosity and molecular ISM

molecular ISM mass even during starburst episodes as dust mass and
mass-weighted temperature evolve only moderately between $z=4$ and $z=2$,

However, compared to the latter, the magnitude of star formation in our sample

mass-to-light ratio (M/L$_{3.4 \mu m}$) with redshift which is consistent with
a passively aging stellar population. We use this to build upon Wen et al.'s

correlation between $\nu$L$_{3.4 \mu m}$ and M$_{Stellar}$ to z ~ 1. By

limits that leave the lowest-mass sources undetected, or (2) resolution limits
that cannot distinguish binaries and/or cluster members in close proximity.
Methods: Recent millimeter-wavelength interferometry observations can now
uncover faint and/or compact sources in order to study a more complete
population of protostars, especially in nearby ($D<500$ pc) clusters. Here we
present ALMA observations of 1 mm (Band 6) continuum in a $3 \times 2$
arcminutes region at the center of Serpens South. Our angular resolution of
$\sim1$ arcsec is equivalent to $\sim400$ au, corresponding to scales of
envelopes and/or disks of protostellar sources. Results: We detect 52 sources
with 1 mm continuum, and we measure masses of $0.002 - 0.9$ solar masses
corresponding to gas and dust in the disk and/or envelope of the protostellar
system. For the deeply embedded (youngest) sources with no IR counterparts, we
find evidence of mass segregation and clustering according to: the Minimum
Spanning Tree method, distribution of projected separations between unique
sources, and concentration of higher-mass sources near to the dense gas at the
cluster center. Conclusions: The mass segregation of the mm sources is likely
primordial rather than dynamical given the young age of this cluster, compared
with segregation time. This is the first case to show this for mm sources in a
low-mass protostellar cluster environment.

formation of the first stars in the universe. Motivated by recent results from
the EDGES experiment, we revisit the standard calculation of the kinetic
temperature of the neutral gas through this period. When the first ultraviolet
(UV) sources turn on, photons redshift into the Lyman lines of neutral hydrogen
and repeatedly scatter within the Lyman-$\alpha$ line. They heat the gas via
atomic recoils, and, through the Wouthuysen-Field effect, set the spin
temperature of the 21-cm hyperfine (spin-flip) line of atomic hydrogen in
competition with the resonant cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. We
show that the Lyman-$\alpha$ photons also mediate energy transfer between the
CMB photons and the thermal motions of the hydrogen atoms. In the absence of
X-ray heating, this new mechanism is the major correction to the temperature of
the adiabatically cooling gas ($\sim 10 \%$ at $z=17$), and is several times
the size of the heating rate found in previous calculations. We also find that
the effect is more dramatic in non-standard scenarios that either enhance the
radio background above the CMB or invoke new physics to cool the gas in order
to explain the EDGES results. The coupling with the radio background can reduce
the depth of the 21-cm absorption feature by almost a factor of two relative to
the case with no sources of heating, and prevent the feature from developing a
flattened bottom. As an inevitable consequence of the UV background that
generates the absorption feature, this heating should be accounted for in any
theoretical prediction.

gaseous fuel for star formation resides in low mass halos which can not cool on
their own due to their primordial composition and low virial temperatures. We
show that star formation can be triggered in these filaments by a passing shock
wave. The shells swept-up by the shock cool and fragment into cold clumps that
form massive stars via thermal instability on a timescale shorter than the
front's dynamical timescale. The shock, in turn, is self-sustained by energy
injection from supernova explosions. The star formation front is analogous to a
detonation wave, which drives exothermic reactions powering the shock. We find
that sustained star formation would typically propel the front to a speed of
$\sim 300-700\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ during the epoch of reionization. Future
observations by the $\textit{James Webb Space Telescope}$ could reveal the
illuminated regions of cosmic filaments, and constrain the initial mass

inverse Compton (IC) radiation of relativistic electrons in the jet scattering
optical-UV photons from the Broad Line Region (BLR), the so-called BLR External
Compton scenario. We test this scenario on the Fermi gamma-ray spectra of 106
broad-line blazars detected with the highest significance or largest BLR, by
looking for cut-off signatures at high energies compatible with gamma-gamma
interactions with BLR photons. We do not find evidence for the expected BLR
absorption. For 2/3 of the sources, we can exclude any significant absorption
($\tau_{max}<1$), while for the remaining 1/3 the possible absorption is
constrained to be 1.5-2 orders of magnitude lower than expected. This result
holds also dividing the spectra in high and low-flux states, and for powerful
blazars with large BLR. Only 1 object out of 10 seems compatible with
substantial attenuation ($\tau_{max}>5$). We conclude that for 9 out of 10
objects, the jet does not interact with BLR photons. Gamma-rays seem either
produced outside the BLR most of the time, or the BLR is ~100x larger than
given by reverberation mapping. This means that i) External Compton on BLR
photons is disfavoured as the main gamma-ray mechanism, vs IC on IR photons
from the torus or synchrotron self-Compton; ii) the Fermi gamma-ray spectrum is
mostly intrinsic, determined by the interaction of the particle distribution
with the seed-photons spectrum; iii) without suppression by the BLR, broad-line
blazars can become copious emitters above 100 GeV, as demonstrated by 3C454.3.
We expect the CTA sky to be much richer of broad-line blazars than previously
thought.

scatter the conduction electrons and give rise to a well defined power law
temperature dependence in the resistivity. The coefficient of this term is
related to the spin-wave stiffness and measurements of the very low temperature
resistivity allow to accompany the behavior of this quantity as the the
ferromagnetic QCP is approached. We find that the spin-wave stiffness decreases
with increasing pressure implying that the transition to the non-magnetic Fermi
liquid state is driven by the softening of the magnons. The observed quantum
critical behavior of the magnetic stiffness is consistent with the influence of
disorder in our system. At quantum criticality ($P = P_c \approx 1.7 \pm 0.02$

probably regulated by the balance between the magnetic field and the other
competitors of self-gravity, in particular turbulence and protostellar
feedback. We have observed 11 massive, dense and young star-forming clumps with
the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in the thermal dust continuum
emission at $\sim 1$~mm with an angular resolution of 0.25 arcseconds with the
aim of determining their population of fragments. We find fragments on
sub-arcsecond scales in 8 out of the 11 sources. The ALMA images indicate two
different fragmentation modes: a dominant fragment surrounded by companions
with much smaller mass and size, and many ($\geq 8$) fragments with a gradual
change in masses and sizes. On average, the largest number of fragments is
found towards the warmer and more massive clumps. Also, the warmer clumps tend
to form fragments with larger mass and size. To understand the role of the
different physical parameters to regulate the final population of the
fragments, we have simulated the collapse of a massive clump of $100$ and $300$
M$_{\odot}$ having different magnetic support. The simulations indicate that:
(1) fragmentation is inhibited when the initial turbulence is low, independent
of the other physical parameters. (2) a filamentary distribution of the
fragments is favoured in a highly magnetised clump. We conclude that the clumps
that show many fragments distributed in a filamentary-like structure are likely
characterised by a strong magnetic field, while the others are possible also in
a weaker magnetic field.

Horizons also revealed numerous N2 ice deposits, in Tombaugh Regio and at

volatile and glacial processes on different timescales. We present numerical
simulations of volatile transport on Pluto performed with a model able to
simulate the N2 cycle over millions of years (Myrs), taking into account the
changes of obliquity and orbital parameters as experienced by Pluto. Results
show that over one obliquity cycle, the latitudes of SP between
25{\deg}S-30{\deg}N are dominated by N2 condensation, while the latitudes
between 30-50{\deg}N are dominated by N2 sublimation. We find that a net amount
of 1 km of ice has sublimed at the northern edge of SP during the last 2 Myrs.
By comparing these results with the observed geology of SP, we can relate the
formation of the pits and the brightness of the ice to the ice flux occurring
at the annual timescale, while the glacial flows at its eastern edge and the
erosion of the water ice mountains all around the ice sheet are related to the
astronomical timescale. We also perform simulations with a glacial flow scheme
which shows that SP is currently at its minimum extent. We also explore the
stability of N2 ice outside SP. Results show that it is not stable at the poles
but rather in the equatorial regions, in particular in depressions, where thick
deposits may persist over tens of Myrs, before being trapped in SP. Finally,
another key result is that the minimum and maximum surface pressures obtained
over the simulated Myrs remain in the range of mm-Pa and Pa, respectively.

their source. These tasks are particularly challenging because they require the
organism to sense local flow information and respond accordingly. Details of
how these capabilities emerge from the interplay between neural control and
mechano-sensory modalities remain elusive. Inspired by these organisms, we
develop a mathematical model of a mobile sensor designed to find the source of
a periodic flow disturbance. The sensor locally extracts the direction of
propagation of the flow signal and adjusts its heading accordingly. We show, in
a simplified flow field and under certain conditions on the controller, that
the mobile sensor converges unconditionally to the source of the flow field.
Then, through carefully-conducted numerical simulations of flow past an
oscillating airfoil, we assess the behavior of the mobile sensor in complex
flows and demonstrate its efficacy in tracking the flow signal and locating the
airfoil. The proposed sensory and control strategy is relevant to the design of
bio-inspired underwater robots, but the general idea of orienting opposite to
the direction of information propagation can be applied more broadly in optimal
sensor placements and climate models.

A key research challenge is to construct locally accurate prediction models
that are informed by global characteristics and data volumes. Previous work has
tackled this problem using clustering and transfer learning approaches, which
identify locally similar characteristics. This paper applies a simpler approach
known as Bayesian hierarchical modeling. We show that hierarchical modeling
supports cross-project comparisons, while preserving local context. To
demonstrate the approach, we conduct a conceptual replication of an existing

a patient's IMD and a doctor's programmer is vulnerable since once the doctor's
programmer is compromised, all of her patients suffer; establishing a temporary
key by leveraging proximity gets rid of pre-shared keys, but as the approach
lacks real authentication, it can be exploited by nearby adversaries or through
man-in-the-middle attacks. Second, while prolonging the lifetime of IMDs is one
of the most important design goals, few schemes explore to lower the
communication and computation overhead all at once. Finally, how to safely
record the commands issued by doctors for the purpose of forensics, which can
be the last measure to protect the patients' rights, is commonly omitted in the
existing literature. Motivated by these important yet open problems, we propose
an innovative scheme e-SAFE, which significantly improves security and safety,
reduces the communication overhead and enables IMD-access forensics. We present
a novel lightweight compressive sensing based encryption algorithm to encrypt

Furthermore, we provide a suite of protocols regarding device pairing,
dual-factor authentication, and accountability-enabled access. The security

allocation and instruction scheduling, two central compiler problems.
Combinatorial optimization has the potential to solve these problems optimally
and to exploit processor-specific features readily. Our approach is the first
to leverage this potential in practice: it captures the complete set of program
transformations used in state-of-the-art compilers, scales to medium-sized
functions of up to 1000 instructions, and generates executable code. This level
of practicality is reached by using constraint programming, a particularly
suitable combinatorial optimization technique. Unison, the implementation of
our approach, is open source, used in industry, and integrated with the LLVM
toolchain.
  An extensive evaluation confirms that Unison generates better code than LLVM
while scaling to medium-sized functions. The evaluation uses systematically
selected benchmarks from MediaBench and SPEC CPU2006 and different processor
architectures (Hexagon, ARM, MIPS). Mean estimated speedup ranges from 1.1% to
10% and mean code size reduction ranges from 1.3% to 3.8% for the different
architectures. A significant part of this improvement is due to the integrated
nature of the approach. Executing the generated code on Hexagon confirms that
the estimated speedup results in actual speedup. Given a fixed time limit,
Unison solves optimally functions of up to 946 instructions, nearly an order of
magnitude larger than previous approaches.
  The results show that our combinatorial approach can be applied in practice
to trade compilation time for code quality beyond the usual compiler
optimization levels, identify improvement opportunities in heuristic
algorithms, and fully exploit processor-specific features.

analogy with Rutherford scattering, we show that a local partial depletion of

semi-classical trajectories on the hard-wall potential and strongly enhance
reflection back to the lead. Scanning gate experiments on a ballistic QR, and

connections. First, recurrent plastic networks with more than two million
parameters can be trained to memorize and reconstruct sets of novel,
high-dimensional 1000+ pixels natural images not seen during training.
Crucially, traditional non-plastic recurrent networks fail to solve this task.
Furthermore, trained plastic networks can also solve generic meta-learning
tasks such as the Omniglot task, with competitive results and little parameter
overhead. Finally, in reinforcement learning settings, plastic networks
outperform a non-plastic equivalent in a maze exploration task. We conclude
that differentiable plasticity may provide a powerful novel approach to the
learning-to-learn problem.

representing the $N$ points via an $N$-hot encoding, which is a density
supported on the discretized domain. We show how the distance distribution is
then simply a collection of quadratic functionals of this density and propose
to recover the point locations so that the estimated distance distribution
matches the measured distance distribution. This can be cast as a constrained
nonconvex optimization problem which we solve using projected gradient descent
with a suitable spectral initializer. We derive conditions under which the
proposed distance distribution matching approach locally converges to a global
optimizer at a linear rate. Compared to the conventional backtracking approach,
our method jointly reconstructs all the point locations and is robust to noise
in the measurements. We substantiate these claims with state-of-the-art
performance across a number of numerical experiments. Our method is the first
practical approach to solve the large-scale noisy beltway problem where the

rough walls, and back to the smooth one, in turbulent closed-conduit flows.
These transitions cause a shift on flow velocity profiles that changes their
parameters when compared to the flow over a smooth wall. Different water flow
rates were imposed in a closed conduit of rectangular cross section, where
rough elements consisting of cavities of d- and k-type were positioned covering
a part of the bottom wall of the test section. Reynolds numbers based on the
channel half-height were moderate, varying between 7800 and 9600, and the
regime upstream of the rough elements was hydraulically smooth. Experimental
data for this specific case remain scarce and the involved physics rests to be
understood. The flow field was measured by low frequency PIV (particle image
velocimetry) and by flow visualization, the latter using a continuous 0.1 W
laser, a high-speed camera, and scripts written by the authors. From the
instantaneous fields measured with PIV, the mean velocities, fluctuations,
shear stresses and turbulence production were computed. The results show the
presence of oscillations in Reynolds stress and turbulence production, that are
higher for the k-type roughness and were not shown in previous experimental
works. From the high-speed movies, the angular velocities and frequencies of
vortices in the cavities were computed, and the occurrence of fluid ejection
from the cavities to upper layers of the flow was observed. A relation between
the angular velocities of inner-cavities vortices and the oscillations in
Reynolds stress and turbulence production is proposed.

tracking is proposed in this paper. The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is used as
the similarity measure to search for the optimal template candidates in
feature-spatial space in a video sequence. The computation of the EMD is
formulated as the transportation problem from linear programming. The
efficiency of the EMD optimization problem limits its use for visual tracking.
To alleviate this problem, a transportation-simplex method is used for EMD
optimization and a monotonically convergent iterative optimization algorithm is
developed. The local sparse representation is used as the appearance models for
the iEMD tracker. The maximum-alignment-pooling method is used for constructing
a sparse coding histogram which reduces the computational complexity of the EMD
optimization. The template update algorithm based on the EMD is also presented.
The iEMD tracking algorithm assumes small inter-frame movement in order to
guarantee convergence. When the camera is mounted on a moving robot, e.g., a
flying quadcopter, the camera could experience a sudden and rapid motion
leading to large inter-frame movements. To ensure that the tracking algorithm
converges, a gyro-aided extension of the iEMD tracker is presented, where
synchronized gyroscope information is utilized to compensate for the rotation
of the camera. The iEMD algorithm's performance is evaluated using eight
publicly available datasets. The performance of the iEMD algorithm is compared
with seven state-of-the-art tracking algorithms based on relative percentage

framework for variational autoencoding with neural networks. The system differs
from existing variational autoencoders (VAEs) in that the prior distribution
used to model each code is conditioned on a similar code from the dataset. In
compression terms this equates to sequentially transmitting the dataset using
an ordering determined by proximity in latent space. Since the prior need only
account for local, rather than global variations in the latent space, the
coding cost is greatly reduced, leading to rich, informative codes. Crucially,
the codes remain informative when powerful, autoregressive decoders are used,
which we argue is fundamentally difficult with normal VAEs. Experimental
results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CelebA show that ACNs discover
high-level latent features such as object class, writing style, pose and facial
expression, which can be used to cluster and classify the data, as well as to
generate diverse and convincing samples. We conclude that ACNs are a promising
new direction for representation learning: one that steps away from IID
modelling, and towards learning a structured description of the dataset as a
whole.

(i) A stronger heredity condition may or may not drastically improve the
minimax rate of convergence. In fact, in some situations, the minimax rates of
convergence are the same under all three heredity conditions; (ii) The minimax
rate of convergence is determined by the maximum of the total price of
estimating the main effects and that of estimating the interaction effects,
which goes beyond purely comparing the order of the number of non-zero main
effects $r_1$ and non-zero interaction effects $r_2$; (iii) Under any of the
three heredity conditions, the estimation of the interaction terms may be the
dominant part in determining the rate of convergence for two different reasons:
1) there exist more interaction terms than main effect terms or 2) a large
ambient dimension makes it more challenging to estimate even a small number of
interaction terms. Second, we construct an adaptive estimator that achieves the
minimax rate of convergence regardless of the true heredity condition and the

hidden layers in a deep network by identifying when the hidden states are off
of the data manifold, and maps these hidden states back to parts of the data
manifold where the network performs well. Our principal contribution is to show
that fortifying these hidden states improves the robustness of deep networks
and our experiments (i) demonstrate improved robustness to standard adversarial
attacks in both black-box and white-box threat models; (ii) suggest that our
improvements are not primarily due to the gradient masking problem and (iii)
show the advantage of doing this fortification in the hidden layers instead of
the input space.

Today, many instruments produce datasets that are too big to be downloaded to a
local computer, yet many of the visualisation tools used by astronomers are
deployed only on desktop computers. Cloud computing is increasingly used to
provide a computation and simulation platform in astronomy, but it also offers
great potential as a visualisation platform. Virtual hosted desktops, with
graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration, allow interactive,
graphics-intensive desktop applications to operate co-located with astronomy
datasets stored in remote data centres. By combining benchmarking and user
experience testing, with a cohort of 20 astronomers, we investigate the
viability of replacing physical desktop computers with virtual hosted desktops.
In our work, we compare two Apple MacBook computers (one old and one new,
representing hardware and opposite ends of the useful lifetime) with two
virtual hosted desktops: one commercial (Amazon Web Services) and one in a
private research cloud (the Australian Nectar Research Cloud). For
two-dimensional image-based tasks and graphics-intensive three-dimensional
operations -- typical of astronomy visualisation workflows -- we found that
benchmarks do not necessarily provide the best indication of performance. When
compared to typical laptop computers, virtual hosted desktops can provide a
better user experience, even with lower performing graphics cards. We also
found that virtual hosted desktops are equally simple to use, provide greater
flexibility in choice of configuration, and may actually be a more
cost-effective option for typical usage profiles.

in long bunch trains, such as in high repetition rate free electron lasers. The
TESLA cavity is equipped with two higher order mode couplers and a fundamental
power coupler (FPC), which break the axial symmetry of the cavity. The passing
electrons therefore experience axially asymmetrical coupler kicks, which depend
on the transverse beam position at the couplers and the rf phase. The resulting
emittance dilution has been studied in detail in the literature. However, the
kick induced by the FPC depends explicitly on the ratio of the forward to the
backward traveling waves at the coupler, which has received little attention.
The intention of this paper is to present the concept of discrete coupler kicks
with a novel approach of separating the field disturbances related to the
standing wave and a reflection dependent part. Particular attention is directed
to the role of the penetration depth of the FPC antenna, which determines the
loaded quality factor of the cavity. The developed beam transport model is
compared to dedicated experiments at FLASH and European XFEL. Both the observed
transverse coupling and detuning related coupler kick variations are in good
agreement with the model. Finally, the expected trajectory variations due to
coupler kick variations at European XFEL are investigated and results of
numerical studies are presented.

theory of integrable systems to construct explicit sections of line bundles
over the combinatorial model of the moduli space of pointed Riemann surfaces
based on Jenkins-Strebel differentials. The line bundles are tensor products of
the determinants of the Hodge or Prym vector bundles with the standard
tautological line bundles $\mathcal L_j$ and the sections are constructed in
terms of tau functions. The combinatorial model is interpreted as the real
slice of a complex analytic moduli space of quadratic differentials where the
phase of each tau-function provides a section of a circle bundle. The phase of
the ratio of the Prym and Hodge tau functions gives a section of the
$\kappa_1$-circle bundle.
  By evaluating the increment of the phase around co-dimension $2$
sub-complexes, we identify the Poincar\'e\ dual cycles to the Chern classes of
the corresponding line bundles: they are expressed explicitly as combination of
Witten's cycle $W_5$ and Kontsevich's boundary. This provides combinatorial
analogues of Mumford's relations on $\mathcal M_{g,n}$ and Penner's relations
in the hyperbolic combinatorial model. The free homotopy classes of loops
around $W_5$ are interpreted as pentagon moves while those of loops around
Kontsevich's boundary as combinatorial Dehn twists.
  Throughout the paper we exploit the classical description of the
combinatorial model in terms of Jenkins--Strebel differentials, parametrized in
terms of {\it homological coordinates}; we also show that they provide Darboux
coordinates for the symplectic structure introduced by Kontsevich. We also
express the latter in clear geometric terms as the intersection pairing in the
odd homology of the canonical double cover.

for concurrent multipath transfer (CMT) is still prominent. Yet, multipath
transport protocols are not widely adopted and TCP-based CMT schemes will still
be in dominant position in 5G. However, the performance of TCP flow transferred
over multiple heterogeneous paths is prone to the link quality asymmetry, the
extent of which was revealed to be significant by our field investigation. In
this paper, we present a performance analysis model for TCP over multiple
heterogeneous paths in 5G scenarios, where both bandwidth and delay asymmetry
are taken into consideration. The evaluation adopting parameters from field
investigation shows that the proposed model can achieve high accuracy in
practical environments. Some interesting inferences can be drawn from the
proposed model, such as the dominant factor that affect the performance of TCP
over heterogeneous networks, and the criteria of determining the appropriate
number of links to be used under different circumstances of path heterogeneity.
Thus, the proposed model can provide a guidance to the design of TCP-based CMT
solutions for 5G mobile services.

  A decade later, Lerman and Whitehouse, and later Meurer, found
higher-dimensional geometrically motivated generalizations of Menger curvature

  In this paper, we provide an extension of Meurer's work that yields a

vehicles and places in urban VANET. As one of the basic transportation
facilities in an urban setting, buses periodically run along their fixed routes
and widely cover city streets. The trajectory of bus lines can be seen as a sub
map of a city. Based on the characters of bus networks, we propose a bus
trajectory-based street-centric routing algorithm (BTSC), which uses bus as
main relay to deliver message. In BTSC, we build a routing graph based on the
trajectories of bus lines by analyzing the probability of bus appearing on
every street. We propose two novel concepts, i.e. the probability of street
consistency (PSC) and the probability of path consistency (PPC) which is used
as metrics to determine routing paths for message delivery. This aims to choose
the best path with higher density of busses and lower probability of
transmission direction deviating from the routing path. In order to improve the
bus forwarding opportunity, we design a bus-based forwarding strategy with ant
colony optimization (FACO) to find a reliable and steady multi-hop link between
two relay buses in order to decrease end-to-end delay. BTSC makes the
improvements in the selection of routing path and the strategy of message
forwarding. Simulation results show that our proposed routing algorithm has a
better performance in transmission ratio, transmission delay and adaptability
to different networks.

regularize and regress the initial depth map, which is then refined with the
reference image to generate the final output. Our framework flexibly adapts
arbitrary N-view inputs using a variance-based cost metric that maps multiple
features into one cost feature. The proposed MVSNet is demonstrated on the
large-scale indoor DTU dataset. With simple post-processing, our method not
only significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-arts, but also is several
times faster in runtime. We also evaluate MVSNet on the complex outdoor Tanks
and Temples dataset, where our method ranks first before April 18, 2018 without
any fine-tuning, showing the strong generalization ability of MVSNet.

centered cubic/tetragonal martensite in ferrous alloys can significantly in-
fluence the microstructure and mechanical properties of the material. Inferring
possible high temperature crystal orientations from observations of ambient
temperature transformation microstructures is hindered by parent austenite-
twin interactions and scatter in the orientation relationship. This creates a
major limitation for studying variant selection phenomena and characteriz- ing
microstructural response to high temperature thermomechanical process- ing
conditions. In this work, composition tables are developed that detail the
product variant boundary misorientation relationships for parent-parent,
parent-twin and twin-twin boundary intersections for the Kurdjumov-Sachs (KS),
Nishiyama-Wassermann (NW), and an experimentally determined irra- tional
orientation relationship. The frequently referenced KS and NW ori- entation
relationships produce significantly different results from experimental
observations. Furthermore, the introduction of a twin into the parent austenite
introduces a substantially larger number of misorientation relationships when
the orientation relationship is irrational. The effects of crystal symmetry on
misorientation results are determined by considering both body centered cu- bic
and body centered tetragonal martensite structures. Lastly, it is observed that
some shared variants are found between twins and parents when assuming cubic
symmetry but not tetragonal symmetry. The results and relationships may be
useful towards accurate and consistent reconstructions of the parent austenite
microstructure from observations of martensite.

Impedance Tomography is modulated by ultrasonic waves thus giving rise to a

the inverse problem as a regularized non-linear optimization problem, show the
existence of a minimizer, and derive optimality conditions. We propose a
non-linear conjugate gradient scheme for finding a minimizer based on the
optimality conditions. All our numerical experiments are done in
two-dimensions. The experiments reveal new insight into the non-linear effects
in the reconstruction. One of the interesting features we observe is that,
depending on the choice of regularization, there is a trade-off between high
resolution and high contrast in the reconstructed images. Our proposed
non-linear optimization framework can be generalized to other hybrid imaging

any given function, which evolutionary factors lead to different circuits, and
whether the evolution of a particular circuit was due to adaptive or
non-adaptive processes. Here, we use digital experimental evolution to study
the diversity of neural circuits that encode motion detection in digital
(artificial) brains. We find that evolution leads to an enormous diversity of
potential neural architectures encoding motion detection circuits, even for
circuits encoding the exact same function. Evolved circuits vary in both
redundancy and complexity (as previously found in genetic circuits) suggesting
that similar evolutionary principles underlie circuit formation using any

is optimally-adapted gains in complexity when evolved further, and that
selection for mutational robustness led this gain in complexity.

communicating with each other. This collaborative localization approach is
built upon a distributed algorithm where individual and relative pose
estimation techniques are combined for the group to localize against
surrounding environments. The MAVs initially detect and match salient features
between each other to create a sparse reconstruction of the observed
environment, which acts as a global map. Once a map is available, each MAV
performs feature detection and tracking with a robust outlier rejection process
to estimate its own six degree-of-freedom pose. Occasionally, the MAVs can also
fuse relative measurements with individual measurements through feature
matching and multiple-view geometry based relative pose computation. We present
the implementation of this algorithm for MAVs and environments simulated within
Microsoft AirSim, and discuss the results and the advantages of collaborative
localization.

  (ICWSM), 2018",,,,"cs.SI cs.CL cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose Quootstrap, a method for extracting quotations, as well as the
names of the speakers who uttered them, from large news corpora. Whereas prior
work has addressed this problem primarily with supervised machine learning, our
approach follows a fully unsupervised bootstrapping paradigm. It leverages the
redundancy present in large news corpora, more precisely, the fact that the
same quotation often appears across multiple news articles in slightly
different contexts. Starting from a few seed patterns, such as [""Q"", said S.],
our method extracts a set of quotation-speaker pairs (Q, S), which are in turn
used for discovering new patterns expressing the same quotations; the process
is then repeated with the larger pattern set. Our algorithm is highly scalable,
which we demonstrate by running it on the large ICWSM 2011 Spinn3r corpus.
Validating our results against a crowdsourced ground truth, we obtain 90%
precision at 40% recall using a single seed pattern, with significantly higher
recall values for more frequently reported (and thus likely more interesting)
quotations. Finally, we showcase the usefulness of our algorithm's output for
computational social science by analyzing the sentiment expressed in our
extracted quotations.

  study of passenger flow in an international airport terminal",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic queueing networks (DQN) model queueing systems where demand varies
strongly with time, such as airport terminals. With rapidly rising global air
passenger traffic placing increasing pressure on airport terminals, efficient
allocation of resources is more important than ever. Parameter inference and
quantification of uncertainty are key challenges for developing decision
support tools. The DQN likelihood function is, in general, intractable and
current approaches to simulation make likelihood-free parameter inference
methods, such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), infeasible since
simulating from these models is computationally expensive. By leveraging a
recent advance in computationally efficient queueing simulation, we develop the
first parameter inference approach for DQNs. We demonstrate our approach with
data of passenger flows in a real airport terminal, and we show that our model
accurately recreates the behaviour of the system and is useful for decision
support. Special care must be taken in developing the distance for ABC since
any useful output must vary with time. We use maximum mean discrepancy, a
metric on probability measures, as the distance function for ABC. Prediction
intervals of performance measures for decision support tools are easily
constructed using draws from posterior samples, which we demonstrate with a
scenario of a delayed flight.

  Metrics","Appeared in FOCS 2018, this is the full version",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of constructing $\varepsilon$-coresets for the $(k,
z)$-clustering problem in a doubling metric $M(X, d)$. An $\varepsilon$-coreset
is a weighted subset $S\subseteq X$ with weight function $w : S \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, such that for any $k$-subset $C \in [X]^k$, it holds that
$\sum_{x \in S}{w(x) \cdot d^z(x, C)} \in (1 \pm \varepsilon) \cdot \sum_{x \in
X}{d^z(x, C)}$.
  We present an efficient algorithm that constructs an $\varepsilon$-coreset
for the $(k, z)$-clustering problem in $M(X, d)$, where the size of the coreset
only depends on the parameters $k, z, \varepsilon$ and the doubling dimension
$\mathsf{ddim}(M)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient
$\varepsilon$-coreset construction of size independent of $|X|$ for general
clustering problems in doubling metrics.
  To this end, we establish the first relation between the doubling dimension
of $M(X, d)$ and the shattering dimension (or VC-dimension) of the range space
induced by the distance $d$. Such a relation was not known before, since one
can easily construct instances in which neither one can be bounded by (some
function of) the other. Surprisingly, we show that if we allow a small
$(1\pm\epsilon)$-distortion of the distance function $d$, and consider the
notion of $\tau$-error probabilistic shattering dimension, we can prove an
upper bound of $O( \mathsf{ddim}(M)\cdot \log(1/\varepsilon)
+\log\log{\frac{1}{\tau}} )$ for the probabilistic shattering dimension for
even weighted doubling metrics. We believe this new relation is of independent
interest and may find other applications.
  We also study the robust coresets and centroid sets in doubling metrics. Our
robust coreset construction leads to new results in clustering and property
testing, and the centroid sets can be used to accelerate the local search
algorithms for clustering problems.

$m$ and $n$ are the number of edges and vertices of the input graph,
respectively. For dense graphs, this bound becomes $2^{\Theta(n^2)}$. This is a
somewhat unique situation, since most of the studied graph problems admit
algorithms running in time $2^{O(n\log n)}$. It is a notorious open problem to
either show an algorithm for edge coloring running in time $2^{o(n^2)}$ or to
refute it, assuming Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) or other well established
assumption.
  We notice that the same question can be asked for list edge coloring, a
well-studied generalization of edge coloring where every edge comes with a set
(often called a list) of allowed colors. Our main result states that list edge
coloring for simple graphs does not admit an algorithm running in time
$2^{o(n^2)}$, unless ETH fails. Interestingly, the algorithm for edge coloring
running in time $2^m n^{O(1)}$ generalizes to the list version without any
asymptotic slow-down. Thus, our lower bound is essentially tight. This also
means that in order to design an algorithm running in time $2^{o(n^2)}$ for
edge coloring, one has to exploit its special features compared to the list
version.

the polar microwave brightness at one cycle is correlated with the low latitude

state-based systems (most prominently automata) from a very abstract point of
view, mainly using tools from category theory. One of its achievements is to
give a completely generic approach of determinization, unifying in an elegant
manner non-deterministic automata, probabilistic automata or non-deterministic
pushdown automata in one and the same model. However, the case of alternating
automata fails to easily fit in this model. The aim of this internship was
therefore to tackle this problem: can alternating automata also be determinized
in the coalgebraic way? Does this give semantics that coincides with the
concretely defined one? In this report, we give a positive answer to both
questions. The main element of our construction is a distributive law, the
definition of which has been for some time an open question.

a means of providing learning depth, this paper presents a novel traffic
database that contains information on a large number of traffic near-miss

near-miss incident database (NIDB) that consists of video clip of dangerous
events captured by monocular driving recorders. (ii) To illustrate the
applicability of NIDB traffic near-miss incidents, we provide two primary
database-related improvements: parameter fine-tuning using various near-miss
scenes from NIDB, and foreground/background separation into motion
representation. Then, using our new database in conjunction with a monocular
driving recorder, we developed a near-miss recognition method that provides
automated systems with a performance level that is comparable to a human-level
understanding of near-miss incidents (64.5% vs. 68.4% at near-miss recognition,

fundamental building block of a new Identity-Based-Encryption (IBE) [GHPT17a].
This signature scheme is based on the rank metric and enjoys remarkably small
key sizes, about 10KBytes for an intended level of security of 128 bits.
Unfortunately we will show that all the parameters proposed for this scheme in
[AGHRZ17] can be broken by an algebraic attack that exploits the fact that the
augmented LRPC codes used in this scheme have very low weight codewords.
Therefore, without RankSign the IBE cannot be instantiated at this time. As a
second contribution we will show that the problem is deeper than finding a new
signature in rank-based cryptography, we also found an attack on the generic
problem upon which its security reduction relies. However, contrarily to the
RankSign scheme, it seems that the parameters of the IBE scheme could be chosen
in order to avoid our attack. Finally, we have also shown that if one replaces
the rank metric in the [GHPT17a] IBE scheme by the Hamming metric, then a
devastating attack can be found.

corresponding elastic gas in equilibrium. However, a derivation of this result
starting from a microscopic model is lacking. Here, we obtain analytical
results for a microscopic model for a granular gas where particles with
two-dimensional velocities are driven homogeneously and isotropically by
reducing the velocities by a factor and adding a stochastic noise. We find two
universal regimes. For generic physically relevant driving, we find that the
tail of the velocity distribution is a Gaussian with additional logarithmic
corrections. Thus, the velocity distribution decays faster than the
corresponding equilibrium gas. The second universal regime is less generic and
corresponds to the scenario described by kinetic theory. Here, the velocity
distribution is shown to decay as an exponential with additional logarithmic
corrections, in contradiction to the predictions of the phenomenological
kinetic theory, necessitating a re-examination of its basic assumptions.

Specifically, for an input sentence, we use a search engine to retrieve
sentence pairs whose source sides are similar with the input sentence, and then
collect $n$-grams that are both in the retrieved target sentences and aligned
with words that match in the source sentences, which we call ""translation
pieces"". We compute pseudo-probabilities for each retrieved sentence based on
similarities between the input sentence and the retrieved source sentences, and
use these to weight the retrieved translation pieces. Finally, an existing NMT
model is used to translate the input sentence, with an additional bonus given
to outputs that contain the collected translation pieces. We show our method
improves NMT translation results up to 6 BLEU points on three narrow domain
translation tasks where repetitiveness of the target sentences is particularly
salient. It also causes little increase in the translation time, and compares
favorably to another alternative retrieval-based method with respect to

the spacetime structure at small distances is given by a piecewise linear (PL)
4-manifold corresponding to a triangulation of a smooth 4-manifold. The
fundamental degrees of freedom are the edge lengths of the triangulation. One
can work with finitely many edge lengths, so that the corresponding Regge path
integral can be made finite by using an appropriate path-integral measure. The
semi-classical limit is computed by using the effective action formalism, and
the existence of a semi-classical effective action restricts the choice of the
path-integral measure. The classical limit is given by the Regge action, so
that one has a quantum gravity theory for a piecewise-flat general relativity.
By using the effective action formalism we show that the observed value of the
cosmological constant can be recovered from the effective cosmological
constant. When the number of 4-simplices in the spacetime triangulation is
large, then the PL effective action is well approximated by a quantum field
theory effective action with a physical cutoff determined by the smallest edge

problem of the linear evolution equation for the double gluon densities, and
include Bose-Einstein enhancement to these equations. We find that the
Bose-Einstein correlations lead to an increase of the anomalous dimension,
which turns out to be suppressed as $1/(N^2_c -1)^2$, in agreement with the
estimates for the twist four anomalous dimension. We believe that understanding
what happens to these contributions at ultra high energies, is a key question
for an effective theory, based on high energy QCD. We derive the evolution
equation for the scattering amplitude of two dipoles with a nucleus, taking
into account the shadowing corrections, and investigate the analytical
solutions in two distinct kinematic regions: deep in the saturation region, and
in the vicinity of the saturation scale. The suggested non-linear evolution
equation is a direct generalization of the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation, which
has to be solved with the initial condition that depends on the saturation
scale $Q_s(Y=Y_0,b)$. With the goal of finding a new small parameter, it is
instructive to compare the solution of the non-linear equation with the
qusi-classical approximation, in which in the initial condition we replace
$Q_s(Y=Y_0,b)$ by $Q_s(Y,b)$. Our final result is that the shadowing

worldwide. This work presents the first machine learning-based solution without
relying on any particular assumptions on the underlying telephony network
infrastructures. The main challenge of this decade-long problem is that it is
unclear how to construct effective features without the access to the telephony
networks' infrastructures. We solve this problem by combining several
innovations. We first develop a TouchPal user interface on top of a mobile App
to allow users tagging malicious calls. This allows us to maintain a
large-scale call log database. We then conduct a measurement study over three
months of call logs, including 9 billion records. We design 29 features based
on the results, so that machine learning algorithms can be used to predict
malicious calls. We extensively evaluate different state-of-the-art machine
learning approaches using the proposed features, and the results show that the
best approach can reduce up to 90% unblocked malicious calls while maintaining
a precision over 99.99% on the benign call traffic. The results also show the
models are efficient to implement without incurring a significant latency
overhead. We also conduct ablation analysis, which reveals that using 10 out of
the 29 features can reach a performance comparable to using all features.

directed graphs (digraphs), which decomposes graph signals into different modes
of variation with respect to the underlying network. Accordingly, to capture
low, medium and high frequencies we seek a digraph (D)GFT such that the
orthonormal frequency components are as spread as possible in the graph
spectral domain. To that end, we advocate a two-step design whereby we: (i)
find the maximum directed variation (i.e., a novel notion of frequency on a
digraph) a candidate basis vector can attain; and (ii) minimize a smooth
spectral dispersion function over the achievable frequency range to obtain the
desired spread DGFT basis. Both steps involve non-convex,
orthonormality-constrained optimization problems, which are efficiently tackled
via a provably convergent, feasible optimization method on the Stiefel
manifold. We also propose a heuristic to construct the DGFT basis from
Laplacian eigen-vectors of an undirected version of the digraph. We show that
the spectral-dispersion minimization problem can be cast as supermodular
optimization over the set of candidate frequency components, whose
orthonormality can be enforced via a matroid basis constraint. This motivates
adopting a scalable greedy algorithm to obtain an approximate solution with
quantifiable worst-case spectral dispersion. We illustrate the effectiveness of
our DGFT algorithms through numerical tests on synthetic and real-world
networks. We also carry out a graph-signal denoising task, whereby the DGFT
basis is used to decompose and then low-pass filter temperatures recorded

predicting the temporal and angular channel characteristics in mmWave bands,

of the sums of the first $2n$ consecutive primes, that is,
$S_n=\sum_{k=1}^{2n}p_k$ with $n=1,2,\ldots$. Heuristic arguments supported by
the corresponding computational results suggest that the primes are distributed
among sequence $(S_n)$ in the same way that they are distributed among positive
integers. In other words, taking into account the Prime Number Theorem, this
assertion is equivalent to
  \begin{equation*}\begin{split} &\# \{p:\, p\,\,{\rm is\,\,a\,\, prime\,\,

generalization of the prime counting function $\pi(x)$ to increasing positive
integer sequences.

mentioned sequence $(S_n)$. Namely, we propose several conjectures and we prove
their consequences concerning the distribution of primes in the sequence

is expected to increase to 400 million by 2025. Approximately 250,000 people
die prematurely each year from asthma out of which, almost all deaths are
avoidable. Most of these deaths occur because the patients are unaware of their
asthmatic morbidity. If detected early, asthmatic mortality rate can be reduced
by 78%, provided that the patients carry appropriate medication for the same
and/or are in lose vicinity to medical equipment like nebulizers. This study
focuses on the development and valuation of algorithms to diagnose asthma
through symptom intensive questionary, clinical data and medical reports.
Machine Learning Algorithms like Back-propagation model, Context Sensitive
Auto-Associative Memory Neural Network Model, C4.5 Algorithm, Bayesian Network
and Particle Swarm Optimization have been employed for the diagnosis of asthma
and later a comparison is made between their respective prospects. All
algorithms received an accuracy of over 80%. However, the use of Auto
Associative Memory Model (on a layered Artificial Neural Network) displayed
much better results. It reached to an accuracy of over 90% and an inconclusive
diagnosis rate of less than 1% when trained with adequate data. In the end,
na\""ive mobile based applications were developed on Android and iOS that made
use of the self-training auto associative memory model to achieve an accuracy
of nearly 94.2%.

behavior of matter in nanoscale. In this report we have demonstrated, through a
unique molecular simulation procedure, that properties of matter in nanosystems
do not follow the same rules as in macroscopic systems. More specifically, it
is shown that extensive properties such as internal energy and entropy are not
extensive, and intensive properties such as temperature and pressure are not
intensive in nanosystems, in contrast to macroscopic systems. Variations of the
Euler exponents for these properties as a function of the number of particles
of the system are reported. As the size of the system increases, the value of
these exponents approach integers that correspond to the macroscopic systems.

  link between a cyclic $\tau\subset U(1)$, the color-electric charge of quarks
  and the vortex mass","49 pages, 3 figures",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The model of dual superconductivity has been revisited considering the
$U(1)$-gauged Ginzburg-Landau lagrangian density on a non-commutative torus
$T^{2}_{NC}$, according to a new approach, we propose, in dealing with
non-commutative space coordinates ($[\hat{x},\hat{y}]=i\theta$). This led to
consider a different set of the twist matrices $\Omega_{\mu}$ relative to
$T^{2}_{NC}$, since the corrisponding set, adopted in previous works, has
resulted to be incompatible with the homogeneity of $T^{2}_{NC}$. We have also
found that the index labelling the twists $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ no longer has the
usual physical role. In fact, the energy, suitably rewritten, of the minimum
configurations at the point of Bogomolny and the quark color-electric charge
$q_{e}$ depend on
$r_{\theta}=\theta_{C}/\theta_{NC}\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\{0\}$, where
$\theta_{C}$ ($\theta_{NC}$) is the parameter that characterizes the
commutative torus $T^{2}_{C}$ ($T^{2}_{NC}$): here $T^{2}_{C}$ is not
characterized only by a $\theta$ null. The quantity $r_{\theta}$ was then found
to determine the order of a cyclic subgroup of $U(1)$ generated by
$e^{i\pi\theta_{NC}}$. Therefore here $q_{e}$ can also be a fraction as well as
a multiple of $g^{-1}$, where $g$ is the magnetic charge of the scalar field.
Furthermore, the above energy was calculated only considering a class of the
twisted boundary conditions solutions without solving, as usual, any system of
equations such as the BPS. Another novelty is the presence of a double Higgs
mechanism regulated by $r_{\theta}$. In this regard, it predicts, in general, a
non null mass for the usual massless Goldstone boson and establishes a relation
between the mass spectrum and $r_{\theta}$ according to which a variation over
time of $r_{\theta}$ involves a quantized variation in time of such masses that
will be null when $r_{\theta}$ assumes values outside a certain interval of
values.

potential between quarks is intrinsically relating to the bag model while
concerning the asymptotically-free nature of colours. Based on the relationship
we employ the symmetry method to analyze the quark-anti-quark system. For the
tight bound system, one of the quark and anti-quark becomes the bag itself. By
imposing the Poincare invariance on the quark-anti-quark bound-state, and
translating the chiral transformation to its spatial manifestation, we can
infer why the chiral symmetry breaking happens. Applying this knowledge to deep
inelastic scattering we reach the conclusion that the measured proton spin in
scattering experiments should be uncertain quantity.
