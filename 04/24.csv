convolutional neural network (CNN). This idea of Channel Boosting exploits both
the channel dimension of CNN (learning from multiple input channels) and
Transfer learning (TL). TL is utilized at two different stages; channel
generation and channel exploitation. In the proposed methodology, a deep CNN is
boosted by various channels available through TL from already trained Deep
Neural Networks, in addition to its original channel. The deep architecture of
CNN then exploits the original and boosted channels down the stream for
learning discriminative patterns. Churn prediction in telecom is a challenging
task due to the high dimensionality and imbalanced nature of the data.
Therefore, churn prediction data is used to evaluate the performance of the
proposed Channel Boosted CNN (CB CNN). In the first phase, informative
discriminative features are being extracted using a stacked autoencoder, and
then in the second phase, these features are combined with the original
features to form Channel Boosted images. Finally, the knowledge gained by a
pretrained CNN is exploited by employing TL. The results are promising and show
the ability of the Channel Boosting concept in learning complex classification
problems by discerning even minute differences in churners and nonchurners. The
proposed work validates the concept observed from the evolution of recent CNN
architectures that the innovative restructuring of a CNN architecture may
increase the networks representative capacity.

proposed. The dissipation level is computed locally for each cell interface. We

stochastic differential games with $n$ players interacting with one another

assumptions that guarantee uniqueness of the MFG equilibrium, a form of law of
large of numbers (LLN), also known as propagation of chaos, has been
established to show that the MFG equilibrium arises as the limit of the
sequence of empirical measures of the $n$-player game Nash equilibria,
including the case when player dynamics are driven by both idiosyncratic and
common sources of noise. The proof of convergence relies on the so-called
master equation for the value function of the MFG, a partial differential
equation on the space of probability measures. In this work, under additional
assumptions, we establish a functional central limit theorem (CLT) that
characterizes the limiting fluctuations around the LLN limit as the unique
solution of a linear stochastic PDE. The key idea is to use the solution to the
master equation to construct an associated McKean-Vlasov interacting
$n$-particle system that is sufficiently close to the Nash equilibrium dynamics
of the $n$-player game for large $n$. We then derive the CLT for the latter
from the CLT for the former. Along the way, we obtain a new multidimensional
CLT for McKean-Vlasov systems. We also illustrate the broader applicability of

compression requires encoding such grammar as a binary string; there are a few
commonly used encodings. We bound the size of practically used encodings for
several heuristical compression methods, including \RePair and \Greedy
algorithms: the standard encoding of \RePair, which combines entropy coding and
special encoding of a grammar, achieves $1.5|S|H_k(S)$, where $H_k(S)$ is
$k$-th order entropy of $S$. We also show that by stopping after some iteration
we can achieve $|S|H_k(S)$. This is particularly interesting, as it explains a
phenomenon observed in practice: introducing too many nonterminals causes the
bit-size to grow. We generalize our approach to other compression methods like
\Greedy and a wide class of irreducible grammars as well as to other

gravitational potential and information on the origin of each star. By way of
demonstration, we apply the mock catalogues to analyses of the young stellar
disc and the stellar halo. We show that: i) the young outer stellar disc
exhibits a flared distribution that is detectable in the height and vertical
velocity distribution of A- and B-dwarf stars up to radii of ~15 kpc; and ii)
the spin of the stellar halo out to 100 kpc can be accurately measured with
Gaia DR2 RR Lyrae stars. These catalogues are well suited for comparisons with

driven by both idiosyncratic and common sources of noise, in which players
interact with each other through their empirical distribution. The unique Nash
equilibrium empirical measure of the $n$-player game is known to converge, as
$n$ goes to infinity, to the unique equilibrium of an associated mean field
game. Under suitable regularity conditions, in the absence of common noise, we
complement this law of large numbers result with non-asymptotic concentration
bounds for the Wasserstein distance between the $n$-player Nash equilibrium
empirical measure and the mean field equilibrium. We also show that the
sequence of Nash equilibrium empirical measures satisfies a weak large
deviation principle, which can be strengthened to a full large deviation
principle only in the absence of common noise. For both sets of results, we
first use the master equation, an infinite-dimensional partial differential
equation that characterizes the value function of the mean field game, to
construct an associated McKean-Vlasov interacting $n$-particle system that is
exponentially close to the Nash equilibrium dynamics of the $n$-player game for
large $n$, by refining estimates obtained in our companion paper. Then we
establish a weak large deviation principle for McKean-Vlasov systems in the
presence of common noise. In the absence of common noise, we upgrade this to a
full large deviation principle and obtain new concentration estimates for
McKean-Vlasov systems. Finally, in two specific examples that do not satisfy
the assumptions of our main theorems, we show how to adapt our methodology to
establish large deviations and concentration results.

each other are the general scenarios in compared to the non-interacting models.
The interaction is usually motivated from the phenomenological ground and thus
there is no such rule to prefer a particular interaction between DM and DE.
Being motivated, in this work, allowing an exponential interaction between DM
and DE in a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic universe, we explore the
dynamics of the universe through the constraints of the free parameters where
the strength of the interaction is characterized by the dimensionless coupling
parameter $\xi$ and the equation of state (EoS) for DE, $w_x$, is supposed to
be a constant. The interaction scenario is fitted using the latest available
observational data. Our analyses report that the observational data permit a
non-zero value of $\xi$ but it is very small and consistent with $\xi =0$. From
the constraints on $w_x$, we find that both phantom ($w_x< -1$) and
quintessence ($w_x> -1$) regimes are equally allowed but $w_x$ is very close to
`$-1$'. The overall results indicate that at the background level, the
interaction model cannot be distinguished from the base $\Lambda $-cold dark
matter model while from the perturbative analyses, the interaction model mildly
deviates from the base model. We highlight that, even if we allow DM and DE to
interact in an exponential manner, but according to the observational data, the
evidence for a non-zero coupling is very small.

computational complexity doubly exponential in the number of variables. It has
long been studied by the Symbolic Computation community and is implemented in a
variety of computer algebra systems, however, it has also found recent interest
in the Satisfiability Checking community for use with SMT-solvers. The SCSC
Project seeks to build bridges between these communities.
  The present report describes progress made during a Research Internship in
Summer 2017 funded by the EU H2020 SCSC CSA. We describe a proof of concept
implementation of an Incremental CAD algorithm in Maple, where CADs are built
and refined incrementally by polynomial constraint, in contrast to the usual
approach of a single computation from a single input. This advance would make
CAD of use to SMT-solvers who search for solutions by constantly reformulating
logical formula and querying solvers like CAD for whether a logical solution is
admissible. We describe experiments for the proof of concept, which clearly
display the computational advantages when compared to iterated re-computation.
In addition, the project implemented this work under the recently verified
Lazard projection scheme (with corresponding Lazard evaluation). That is the
minimal complete CAD method in theory, and this is the first documented
implementation.

Donaldson-Sun, in which 2-sided Ricci curvature bounds were assumed. As a basic

is developed for PPTs in the present paper. The model accounts for the
secondary plasma sheets generated due to the crowbar breakdowns as well as the

the position of the plasma and neutral mass sheets, mean exit velocity, thrust

is validated and discussed for two different ablative pulsed plasma thrusters.
In the last section, the plasma sheet model and electrical circuit model are
also validated for a liquid propellant PPT developed at the University of

storing these keys securely is a challenge, especially if they are used from
multiple devices. Storing keys in a centralized location, like an
Internet-accessible server, raises serious security concerns (e.g. server
compromise). Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a
well-known solution for protecting sensitive data in untrusted environments,
and are now becoming available on commodity server platforms.
  Although the idea of protecting keys using a server-side TEE is
straight-forward, in this paper we validate this approach and show that it
enables new desirable functionality. We describe the design, implementation,
and evaluation of a TEE-based Cloud Key Store (CKS), an online service for
securely generating, storing, and using personal cryptographic keys. Using
remote attestation, users receive strong assurance about the behaviour of the
CKS, and can authenticate themselves using passwords while avoiding typical
risks of password-based authentication like password theft or phishing. In
addition, this design allows users to i) define policy-based access controls
for keys; ii) delegate keys to other CKS users for a specified time and/or a
limited number of uses; and iii) audit all key usages via a secure audit log.
We have implemented a proof of concept CKS using Intel SGX and integrated this
into GnuPG on Linux and OpenKeychain on Android. Our CKS implementation
performs approximately 6,000 signature operations per second on a single
desktop PC. The latency is in the same order of magnitude as using
locally-stored keys, and 20x faster than smart cards.

mortality rates between large groups of births, for example, comparing births

measured within-group variability in infant and child mortality have used tools
from the income inequality literature, such as Gini indices. We show that the
latter are inappropriate for infant and child mortality. We develop novel tools
that are appropriate for analyzing infant and child mortality inequality,
including inequality measures, covariate adjustments, and ANOVA methods. We
illustrate how to handle uncertainty about complex inference targets, including
ensembles of probabilities and kernel density estimates. We illustrate our
methodology using a large data set from India, where we estimate infant and
child mortality risk for over 400,000 births using a Bayesian hierarchical

of births, not between them, and thus that within-group mortality needs to be
taken into account when assessing inequality in infant and child mortality. Our
approach has broad applicability to many health indicators.

many star formation theories. Therefore it is important to know under what
conditions such a cloud will undergo homologous collapse into a single, massive
object, or will fragment into a spectrum of smaller ones. And if it fragments,
do initial conditions (e.g. Jeans mass, sonic mass) influence the mass function
of the fragments, as predicted by many theories of star formation? In this
paper we show that the relevant parameter separating homologous collapse from
fragmentation is not the Mach number of the initial turbulence (as suspected by
many), but the infall Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{\rm infall}\sim\sqrt{G M/(R
c_s^2)}$, equivalent to the number of Jeans masses in the initial cloud $N_J$.
We also show that fragmenting clouds produce a power-law mass function with
slopes close to the expected -2 (i.e. equal mass in all logarithmic mass
intervals). However, the low-mass cut-off of this mass function is entirely
numerical; the initial properties of the cloud have no effect on it. In other
words, if $\mathcal{M}_{\rm infall}\gg 1$, fragmentation proceeds without limit
to masses much smaller than the initial Jeans mass.

that the background radiation field includes a contribution from a component in

This unusual kind of crystal field splitting is likely responsible for the

kpc km/s. Even if the halo is mildly triaxial, Lz of a recently ejected nearby
HVS remains negligible, since its flight time from the Galactic Center is too

about the Solar position and velocity, such a HVS would apparently have
noticeable non-zero azimuthal angular momentum, due to the wrong reflex motion
of the Sun. Conversely, with precise astrometric data for a nearby HVS, we can
measure the Solar position and velocity by assuming that the HVS has zero
azimuthal angular momentum. Based on this idea, here we propose a method to
estimate the Galactocentric distance of the Sun R0 and the Galactocentric Solar

the equilibrium potential. The resulting dispersion relation is that the total
jetting force exerted by a perturbed hole on the particles balances the
electric restoring tension of the hole. The tension is quantitatively small and
can often be ignored. The particle force is expressed as integrals of
equilibrium parameters over the hole and is shown at low frequency to be
exactly equal to what has recently been found (by different analysis) to
express `kinematic' hole momentum conservation. The mechanism of instability
has nothing to do with the previously hypothesized transverse electron
focusing. The unmagnetized growth rate $\gamma(k)$ is found numerically and is
in excellent agreement with recent kinematic estimates. Magnetic field
stabilization of the transverse mode is also evaluated. The resulting stability
boundary for Maxwellian holes is in reasonable agreement with previously

Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). The CRLB is seen to be a function of the analog
combiner, the digital combiner, and the bit allocation matrix. We attempt to
minimize the CRLB with respect to the bit allocation matrix by making suitable

allocation design reduces to a set of simple inequalities consisting of ADC
bits, channel singular values and covariance of the quantization noise along
each RF path. This results in a simple and computationally efficient bit
allocation algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the MSE performance of
our proposed bit allocation is very close to that of the Full Search (FS) bit

assigning rewards and aggregating Q-values. Experiments reported in this paper
show that SRL+CS learns consistently faster than Q-learning and DSRL, achieving
also a higher accuracy. In the hardest case, where agents were trained in a
deterministic environment and tested in a random environment, SRL+CS achieves
nearly 100% average accuracy compared to DSRL's 70% and DQN's 50% accuracy. To

  work",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dictionary learning is a popular approach for inferring a hidden basis or
dictionary in which data has a sparse representation. Data generated from the
dictionary A (an n by m matrix, with m > n in the over-complete setting) is
given by Y = AX where X is a matrix whose columns have supports chosen from a
distribution over k-sparse vectors, and the non-zero values chosen from a
symmetric distribution. Given Y, the goal is to recover A and X in polynomial
time. Existing algorithms give polytime guarantees for recovering incoherent
dictionaries, under strong distributional assumptions both on the supports of
the columns of X, and on the values of the non-zero entries. In this work, we
study the following question: Can we design efficient algorithms for recovering
dictionaries when the supports of the columns of X are arbitrary?
  To address this question while circumventing the issue of
non-identifiability, we study a natural semirandom model for dictionary
learning where there are a large number of samples $y=Ax$ with arbitrary
k-sparse supports for x, along with a few samples where the sparse supports are
chosen uniformly at random. While the few samples with random supports ensures
identifiability, the support distribution can look almost arbitrary in
aggregate. Hence existing algorithmic techniques seem to break down as they
make strong assumptions on the supports.
  Our main contribution is a new polynomial time algorithm for learning
incoherent over-complete dictionaries that works under the semirandom model.
Additionally the same algorithm provides polynomial time guarantees in new
parameter regimes when the supports are fully random. Finally using these
techniques, we also identify a minimal set of conditions on the supports under
which the dictionary can be (information theoretically) recovered from
polynomial samples for almost linear sparsity, i.e., $k=\tilde{O}(n)$.

supervision of expert actions to learn both 'what' and 'how' to imitate. We
pursue an alternative paradigm wherein an agent first explores the world
without any expert supervision and then distills its experience into a
goal-conditioned skill policy with a novel forward consistency loss. In our
framework, the role of the expert is only to communicate the goals (i.e., what
to imitate) during inference. The learned policy is then employed to mimic the
expert (i.e., how to imitate) after seeing just a sequence of images
demonstrating the desired task. Our method is 'zero-shot' in the sense that the
agent never has access to expert actions during training or for the task
demonstration at inference. We evaluate our zero-shot imitator in two
real-world settings: complex rope manipulation with a Baxter robot and
navigation in previously unseen office environments with a TurtleBot. Through
further experiments in VizDoom simulation, we provide evidence that better
mechanisms for exploration lead to learning a more capable policy which in turn
improves end task performance. Videos, models, and more details are available

deliberation capacity that is based on episodic memory. The model has been
shown to provide a flexible framework for constructing reinforcement-learning
agents, and it allows for quantum mechanical generalization, which leads to a
speed-up in deliberation time. PS agents have been applied successfully in the
context of complex skill learning in robotics, and in the design of
state-of-the-art quantum experiments. In this paper, we study the performance
of projective simulation in two benchmarking problems in navigation, namely the
grid world and the mountain car problem. The performance of PS is compared to
standard tabular reinforcement learning approaches, Q-learning and SARSA. Our
comparison demonstrates that the performance of PS and standard learning
approaches are qualitatively and quantitatively similar, while it is much
easier to choose optimal model parameters in case of projective simulation,
with a reduced computational effort of one to two orders of magnitude. Our
results show that the projective simulation model stands out for its simplicity
in terms of the number of model parameters, which makes it simple to set up the
learning agent in unknown task environments.

investigated. Two approaches are considered for the analysis. One is based on a
semi-analytical formulation of the relevant boundary-value problem for a
no-tension material response; the other employs a plastic-damage-contact
constitutive model, the CraftS model, to capture the complex microstructural
behaviour of the material. The latter has been implemented in the finite
element program LUSAS and has been already successfully employed to describe
progressive instability in eccentrically loaded brickwork wallettes of
rectangular cross section. Equilibrium paths and limit load estimations are
computed for both analysis approaches for a range of column aspect ratios and
load eccentricities. It is shown that the type of material response becomes
less important for specimens with height-to-diameter aspect ratios greater than
7.5 and for loads applied to points in the kernel of the cross section, while
for higher eccentricities the presence of a tensile strength increases
considerably the limit load. The damage evolution predicted by the models is
also investigated for selected cases, showing that the formulation based on the
no-tension material is able to capture with good agreement the damaged zone of
the column for loads with low eccentricities. For the same type of loading, a
useful design formula is provided.

tractable. We identify a finite portion of each CFT Hilbert space relevant for
de Sitter. Its maximum energy level coincides with the transition to the
universal Cardy behavior for theories with a large central charge and a sparse
light spectrum, derived by Hartman, Keller, and Stoica. Significant
interactions between the two CFTs, derived previously for other reasons,
suggest a maximally mixed state upon tracing out one of the two sectors; we
derive this by determining the holographic Renyi entropies. The resulting

intermediate position between the loci of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters

progresses uncovered a new formulation using only IR data, without reference to
$G/H$, by imposing the Adler's zero condition, which can be seen to originate
from the superselection rule in the space of degenerate vacua. The IR
construction imposes a nonlinear shift symmetry on the Lagrangian to enforce
the correct single soft limit amid constraints of the unbroken group $H$. We
present a systematic study on the consequence of the Adler's zero condition in
correlators of nonlinear sigma model, by deriving the conserved current and the
Ward identity associated with the nonlinear shift symmetry, and demonstrate how
the old-fashioned current algebra emerges. The Ward identity leads to a new
representation of on-shell amplitudes, which amounts to bootstrapping the
higher point amplitudes from lower point amplitudes and adding new vertices to
satisfy the Adler's condition. The IR perspective allows one to extract Feynman
rules for the mysterious extended theory of biadjoint cubic scalars residing in
the subleading single soft limit, which was first discovered using the
Cachazo-He-Yuan representation of scattering amplitudes. In addition, we
present the subleading triple soft theorem in the nonlinear sigma model and
show that it is also controlled by on-shell amplitudes of the same extended
theory as in the subleading single soft limit.

for galaxies with undetected [O III]. Using a sample of ~174000 star-forming

metallicities) are comparable to those of the star-forming population,
coherently with the hypothesis of recent quenching, but preferably reside in
higher-density environments.Most candidates have morphologies similar to
star-forming galaxies, suggesting that no morphological transformation has
occurred yet. From a survival analysis we find a low fraction of candidates

galaxies (BCGs) of a sample of groups and clusters of galaxies extracted from
the Chandra archive. The exquisite angular resolution of Chandra allows us to
obtain robust photometry at the position of the BCG, and to firmly identify
unresolved X-ray emission when present, thanks to an accurate characterization
of the extended emission at the BCG position. We consider two redshift bins
(0.2<z<0.3 and 0.55<z<0.75) and analyze all the clusters observed by Chandra
with exposure time larger than 20 ks. Our samples have 81 BCGs in 73 clusters
and 51 BCGs in 49 clusters in the low- and high-redshift bin, respectively.
X-ray emission in the soft (0.5-2 keV) or hard (2-7 keV) band is detected only
in 14 and 9 BCGs ($\sim 18$% of the total samples), respectively. The X-ray
photometry shows that at least half of the BCGs have a high hardness ratio,
compatible with significant intrinsic absorption. This is confirmed by the
spectral analysis with a power law model plus intrinsic absorption. We compute
the fraction of X-ray bright BCGs above a given hard X-ray luminosity,
considering only sources with positive photometry in the hard band (12/5
sources in the low/high-z sample). In the 0.2<z<0.3 interval the hard X-ray
luminosity ranges from $10^{42}$ to $7 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with most
sources found below $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. In the $0.55<z<0.75$ range, we find
a similar distribution of luminosities below $\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, plus
two very bright sources of a few $10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ associated with two
radio galaxies. We also find that X-ray luminous BCGs tend to be hosted by
cool-core clusters, despite the majority of cool cores do not host nuclear
X-ray emission (Abridged).

case of graphene with uniform Bychkov-Rashba interaction and shown to capture
spin relaxation processes and associated charge-to-spin interconversion

fluctuations and electric fields. A controlled diagrammatic evaluation of the
generalized spin susceptibility in the diffusive regime of weak spin-orbit

standard Dyakonov-Perel relation for both weak (Gaussian) and resonant

Ongoing planet formation processes are invoked for some debris disks, such as
the continued growth of dwarf planets in an unstirred disk, or the growth of
terrestrial planets through giant impacts. Planets imprint structure on debris
disks in many ways; images of gaps, clumps, warps, eccentricities and other

of weak scale supersymmetry is higher than what was perceived in the pre-Higgs
boson discovery era and lies in the several TeV region. This makes the
discovery of supersymmetry more challenging and argues for hadron colliders
beyond LHC at $\sqrt s=14$ TeV. The Future Circular Collider (FCC) study at
CERN is considering a 100 TeV collider to be installed in a 100 km tunnel in
the Lake Geneva basin. Another 100 km collider being considered in China is the
Super proton-proton Collider (SppC). A third possibility recently proposed is
the High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC) which would use the existing CERN tunnel but
achieve a center-of-mass energy of 28 TeV by using FCC magnet technology at
significantly higher luminosity than at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). In
this work we investigate the potential of HE-LHC for the discovery of
supersymmetry. We study a class of supergravity unified models under the Higgs
boson mass and the dark matter relic density constraints and compare the
analysis with the potential reach of the HL-LHC. A set of benchmarks are
presented which are beyond the discovery potential of HL-LHC but are
discoverable at HE-LHC. For comparison, we study model points at HE-LHC which
are also discoverable at HL-LHC. For these model points, it is found that their
discovery would require a HL-LHC run between 5-8 years while the same parameter
points can be discovered in a period of few weeks to $\sim 1.5$ yr at HE-LHC
running at its optimal luminosity of $2.5\times 10^{35}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.
The analysis indicates that the HE-LHC possibility should be seriously pursued
as it would significantly increase the discovery reach for supersymmetry beyond
that of HL-LHC and decrease the run period for discovery.

three-dimensional euclidean loop quantum gravity with vanishing cosmological
constant and quantum field theory in the continuum. We will argue, in
particular, that in three spacetime dimensions the discrete spectra for the
geometric boundary observables that we find in loop quantum gravity can be
understood from the quantisation of a conformal boundary field theory in the
continuum without ever introducing spin networks or triangulations of space. At
a technical level, the starting point is the Hamiltonian formalism for general
relativity in regions with boundaries at finite distance. At these finite
boundaries, we choose specific conformal boundary conditions (the boundary is a
minimal surface) that are derived from a boundary field theory for an SU(2)
boundary spinor, which is minimally coupled to the spin connection in the bulk.
The resulting boundary equations of motion define a conformal field theory with
vanishing central charge. We will quantise this boundary field theory and show
that the length of a one-dimensional cross section of the boundary has a
discrete spectrum. In addition, we will introduce a new class of coherent
states, study the quasi-local observables that generate the quasi-local
Virasoro algebra and discuss some strategies to evaluate the partition function
of the theory.

Thermomechanical properties and composition of the following glass brands: LK5,

dependence of coefficients of thermal expansion are proposed for further use.
Residual stresses in silicon-glass bonds are estimated with these models and

as the largest marginal change in output between neighboring databases, is of
substantial significance in determining the accuracy of private data analyses.
Techniques for improving accuracy when the average sensitivity is much smaller
than the worst-case sensitivity have been developed within the differential
privacy literature, including tools such as smooth sensitivity,
Sample-and-Aggregate, Propose-Test-Release, and Lipschitz extensions.
  In this work, we provide a new and general Sensitivity-Preprocessing
framework for reducing sensitivity, where efficient application gives
state-of-the-art accuracy for privately outputting the important statistical
metrics median and mean when no underlying assumptions are made about the
database. In particular, our framework compares favorably to smooth sensitivity
for privately outputting median, in terms of both running time and accuracy.
Furthermore, because our framework is a preprocessing step, it can also be
complementary to smooth sensitivity and any other private mechanism, where
applying both can achieve further gains in accuracy.
  We additionally introduce a new notion of individual sensitivity and show
that it is an important metric in the variant definition of personalized
differential privacy. We show that our algorithm can extend to this context and
serve as a useful tool for this variant definition and its applications in
markets for privacy.

intervals, which are the range of a summary statistic one may obtain given a
class of possible endogenous manipulations of the data. Hacking intervals
require no appeal to hypothetical data sets drawn from imaginary
superpopulations. A scientific result with a small hacking interval is more
robust to researcher manipulation than one with a larger interval, and is often
easier to interpret than a classical confidence interval. Some versions of
hacking intervals turn out to be equivalent to classical confidence intervals,
which means they may also provide a more intuitive and potentially more useful
interpretation of classical confidence intervals.

of high-dimensional precision matrix. In this case, estimating the bandwidth of
the precision matrix is a crucial initial step for subsequent analysis.
Although there exist some consistent frequentist tests for the bandwidth
parameter, bandwidth selection consistency for precision matrices has not been
established in a Bayesian framework. In this paper, we propose a prior
distribution tailored to the bandwidth estimation of high-dimensional precision
matrices. The banded structure is imposed via the Cholesky factor from the
modified Cholesky decomposition. We establish the strong model selection
consistency for the bandwidth as well as the consistency of the Bayes factor.
The convergence rates for Bayes factors under both the null and alternative
hypotheses are derived which yield similar order of rates. As a by-product, we
also proposed an estimation procedure for the Cholesky factors yielding an
almost optimal order of convergence rates. Two-sample bandwidth test is also
considered, and it turns out that our method is able to consistently detect the
equality of bandwidths between two precision matrices. The simulation study
confirms that our method in general outperforms the existing frequentist and
Bayesian methods.

altered an image $\mathbf{x} \rightarrow f(\mathbf{x})$. Recover the image
$\mathbf{x}$. This black box might be any number of simple or complicated
things: a linear or non-linear filter, some app on your phone, etc. The latter
is a good canonical example for the problem we address: Given only ""the app""
and an image produced by the app, find the image that was fed to the app. You
can run the given image (or any other image) through the app as many times as
you like, but you can not look inside the (code for the) app to see how it
works. At first blush, the problem sounds a lot like a standard inverse
problem, but it is not in the following sense: While we have access to the
black box $f(\cdot)$ and can run any image through it and observe the output,
we do not know how the block box alters the image. Therefore we have no
explicit form or model of $f(\cdot)$. Nor are we necessarily interested in the
internal workings of the black box. We are simply happy to reverse its effect
on a particular image, to whatever extent possible. This is what we call the
""rendition"" (rather than restoration) problem, as it does not fit the mold of
an inverse problem (blind or otherwise). We describe general conditions under
which rendition is possible, and provide a remarkably simple algorithm that
works for both contractive and expansive black box operators. The principal and
novel take-away message from our work is this surprising fact: One simple
algorithm can reliably undo a wide class of (not too violent) image
distortions.

has been interpreted as either being fueled by fallback onto a newly formed
black hole, or by the spin-down luminosity of an ultra-magnetized millisecond
neutron star. If the latter model is assumed, GRB X-ray afterglow light curves
can be analytically reproduced. We fit a sample of GRB X-ray plateaus,
interestingly yielding a distribution in the magnetic field versus spin period
(B-P) diagram consistent with $B\propto P^{7/6}$. This is expected from the
well-established physics of the spin-up line minimum period for Galactic
millisecond pulsars. The normalisation of the relation we obtain perfectly
matches spin-up line predictions for the expected masses ($\sim 1 M_{\odot}$)
and radii ($\sim 10 {\rm ~km}$) of newly born magnetars, and mass accretion
rates consistent with GRB expectations of $10^{-4} M_{\odot}/{\rm s} <\dot{M}<
10^{-1} M_{\odot}/{\rm s}$. Short GRBs with extended emission (SEE) appear
towards the high period end of the distribution, while the long GRBs (LGRBs)
towards the short period end. This result is consistent with spin-up limit
expectations where the total accreted mass determines the position of the
neutron star in the B-P diagram. The P-B distribution for LGRBs and SEE are
statistically different, further supporting the idea that the fundamental plane
relation \citep{dainotti16c,Dainotti2017} is a powerful discriminant among
those populations. Our conclusions are robust against suppositions regarding
the GRB collimation angle and magnetar breaking index, which shifts the
resulting magnetar properties parallel to the spin-up line, and strongly
support a magnetar origin for GRBs presenting X-ray plateaus.

in the quantum chaotic system, a simple operator can become increasingly
complicated under unitary time evolution. This can be diagnosed by various
measures such as square of the commutator (out-of-time-ordered correlator),
operator entanglement entropy etc. In this paper, we discuss operator
scrambling in three representative models: a chaotic spin-$1/2$ chain with
spatially local interactions, a 2-local spin model and the quantum linear map.
In the first two examples, although the speeds of scrambling are quite
different, a simple Pauli spin operator can eventually approach a ""highly
entangled"" operator with operator entanglement entropy taking a volume law
value (close to the Page value). Meanwhile, the spectrum of the operator
reduced density matrix develops a universal spectral correlation which can be
characterized by the Wishart random matrix ensemble. In the second example, we
further connect the 2-local model into a one dimensional chain and briefly
discuss the operator scrambling there. In contrast, in the quantum linear map,
although the square of commutator can increase exponentially with time, a
simple operator does not scramble but performs chaotic motion in the operator
basis space determined by the classical linear map. We show that once we modify
the quantum linear map such that operator can mix in the operator basis, the
operator entanglement entropy can grow and eventually saturate to its Page
value, thus making it a truly quantum chaotic model.

However, the real world in which such radios operate requires them to be able

the need for selective RF filters on the front end of the receiver to block the
large, out of band RF signals so that the finite dynamic range of the SDR is
not overwhelmed and the desired nanowatt signals can be detected and digitally
processed. This is currently typically done with a number of narrow band
filters that are switched in and out under program control. What is needed is a
small, fast, wide tuning range, high Q, low loss filter that can continuously
tune over large regions of the microwave spectrum. In this paper we show how
extreme throw MEMS actuators can be used to build such filters operating up to
15 GHz and beyond. The key enabling attribute of our MEMS actuators is that
they have large, controllable, out-of-plane actuation ranges of a millimeter or
more. In a capacitance-post loaded cavity filter geometry, this gives
sufficient precisely controllable motion to produce widely tunable devices in
the 4-15 GHz regime.

a combinatorial hypothesis about the soundness of a certain ""Grassmanian
agreement tester"". In this work, we show that the hypothesis of Dinur et. al.
follows from a conjecture we call the ""Inverse Shortcode Hypothesis""
characterizing the non-expanding sets of the degree-two shortcode graph. We
also show the latter conjecture is equivalent to a characterization of the

of Dinur et. al. (2017).
  Following our work, Khot, Minzer and Safra (2018) proved the ""Inverse

of Dinur et. al. (2016), completes the proof of the 2 to 2 conjecture with
imperfect completeness. Moreover, we believe that the shortcode graph provides
a useful view of both the hypothesis and the reduction, and might be useful in
extending it further.

adapt their speech acoustics to each other in conversation. This alignment of
spoken behavior has important implications for conversational success. However,
modeling the subtle nature of entrainment in spoken dialogue continues to pose
a challenge. In this paper, we propose a straightforward definition for local
entrainment in the speech domain and operationalize an algorithm based on this:
acoustic-prosodic features that capture entrainment should be maximally
different between real conversations involving two partners and sham
conversations generated by randomly mixing the speaking turns from the original
two conversational partners. We propose an approach for measuring local
entrainment that quantifies alignment of behavior on a turn-by-turn basis,
projecting the differences between interlocutors' acoustic-prosodic features
for a given turn onto a discriminative feature subspace that maximizes the
difference between real and sham conversations. We evaluate the method using
the derived features to drive a classifier aiming to predict an objective
measure of conversational success (i.e., low versus high), on a corpus of
task-oriented conversations. The proposed entrainment approach achieves 72%
classification accuracy using a Naive Bayes classifier, outperforming three
previously established approaches evaluated on the same conversational corpus.

between individual agents that have a tendency to orient towards each other.
Flocking is common among animal groups and might also be useful in robotic
swarms. In the interest of learning how to control flocking behavior, recent
work in the multiagent systems literature has explored the use of influencing
agents for guiding flocking agents to face a target direction. The existing
work in this domain has focused on simulation settings of small areas with
toroidal shapes. In such settings, agent density is high, so interactions are
common, and flock formation occurs easily. In our work, we study new
environments with lower agent density, wherein interactions are more rare. We
study the efficacy of placement strategies and influencing agent behaviors
drawn from the literature, and find that the behaviors that have been shown to
work well in high-density conditions tend to be much less effective in lower
density environments. The source of this ineffectiveness is that the
influencing agents explored in prior work tended to face directions optimized
for maximal influence, but which actually separate the influencing agents from
the flock. We find that in low-density conditions maintaining a connection to
the flock is more important than rushing to orient towards the desired
direction. We use these insights to propose new influencing agent behaviors,
which we dub ""follow-then-influence""; agents act like normal members of the
flock to achieve positions that allow for control and then exert their
influence. This strategy overcomes the difficulties posed by low density
environments.

implemented using a generalized vehicle model and can be easily extended to
other classes of vehicles. The performance of gradient aware-shrinking domain

  These constraints are similar to those found in the Euclidean minimum
spanning tree (EMST) realization problem. A crucial difference is that the
realization map is (partially) determined by the random variable $f$.
  In this paper, we consider embeddings $f : V \rightarrow \{ x, y\}^d$ for
arbitrary $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that arbitrary trees can be realized
with high probability when $d = \Omega(n \log n)$. We prove an analogous result
for graphs parametrized by the arboricity: specifically, we show that an
arbitrary graph $G$ with arboricity $a$ can be realized with high probability
when $d = \Omega(n a^2 \log n)$. Additionally, if $r$ is the minimum effective
resistance of the edges, $G$ can be realized with high probability when
$d=\Omega\left((n/r^2)\log n\right)$. Next, we show that it is necessary to
have $d \geq \binom{n}{2}/6$ to realize random graphs, or $d \geq n/2$ to
realize random spanning trees of the complete graph. This is true even if we
permit an arbitrary embedding $f : V \rightarrow \{ x, y\}^d$ for any $x, y \in
\mathbb{R}$ or negative weights. Along the way, we prove a probabilistic analog
of Radon's theorem for convex sets in $\{0,1\}^d$.

inference for gene expression data which involves realizing a tree, such as

was used within a mean-field approach, which yields partially non-physical
results since the degeneracy between two adjacent Mott lobes is not taken into
account. In order to correct such non-physical results we apply the
Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory to the mean-field approximation of the
Bose-Hubbard model. Detailed explanations of how to use the Brillouin-Wigner
theory are presented, including a graphical approach that allows to efficiently
keep track of the respective analytic terms. To prove the validity of this
computation, the results are compared with other works. Besides the analytic
calculation of the phase boundary from Mott-insulator to superfluid phase, the
condensate density is also determined by simultaneously solving two algebraic
equations. The analytical and numerical results turn out to be physically
meaningful and can cover a region of system parameters inaccessible until now.
Our results are of particular interest provided an harmonic trap is added to
the former calculations in an homogeneous system, in view of describing an
experiment within the local density approximation. Thus, the paper represents
an essential preparatory work for determining the experimentally observed
wedding-cake structure of particle-density profile at both finite temperature

lucrative target for attackers. With possession of the private key, an attacker
virtually owns all of the currency in the compromised wallet. Managing
cryptocurrency wallets offline, in isolated ('air-gapped') computers, has been
suggested in order to secure the private keys from theft. Such air-gapped

private keys can be exfiltrated from air-gapped wallets. In the adversarial
attack model, the attacker infiltrates the offline wallet, infecting it with
malicious code. The malware can be preinstalled or pushed in during the initial
installation of the wallet, or it can infect the system when removable media
(e.g., USB flash drive) is inserted into the wallet's computer in order to sign
a transaction. These attack vectors have repeatedly been proven feasible in the
last decade (e.g., [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10]). Having obtained a
foothold in the wallet, an attacker can utilize various air-gap covert channel
techniques (bridgeware [11]) to jump the airgap and exfiltrate the wallets
private keys. We evaluate various exfiltration techniques, including physical,
electromagnetic, electric, magnetic, acoustic, optical, and thermal techniques.
This research shows that although cold wallets provide a high degree of
isolation, it is not beyond the capability of motivated attackers to compromise
such wallets and steal private keys from them. We demonstrate how a 256-bit
private key (e.g., bitcoin's private keys) can be exfiltrated from an offline,

Comparison of the recordings reveals clear recordings of teleseismic

demonstrates the deck instrument is affected by resonance frequencies of the

higher. In addition, additional decoherence is observed near 1 Hz during
periods of strong airflow due to air conditioning cycling. However, excellent
coherence and a transfer function near 1 can be observed in the important

a hazard analysis and risk assessment has to be done. The ISO 26262 standard
gives hints how to process this step and demands a systematic way to identify

identification, but lack applicability for automated vehicles due to the high
variety and number of different driving situations even with a reduced

Hazard and Operability Analysis approach is used to identify system
malfunctions. A combination of all methods results in operating scenes with
potential hazardous events. These can be assessed afterwards towards their
criticality. A use case example is taken from the current development phase of

and $T$, each of length at most $n$, and we are asked to find a longest string
occurring as a fragment of both $S$ and $T$. This is a classical and
well-studied problem in computer science with a known $\mathcal{O}(n)$-time
solution. In the fully dynamic version of the problem, edit operations are
allowed in either of the two strings, and we are asked to report an LCS after
each such operation. We present the first solution to this problem that
requires sublinear time per edit operation. In particular, we show how to
return an LCS in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{2/3})$ time (or
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{n})$ time if edits are allowed in only one of the
two strings) after each operation using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n)$ space.
  This line of research was recently initiated by the authors [SPIRE 2017] in a
somewhat restricted dynamic variant. An $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n)$-sized data
structure that returns an LCS of the two strings after a single edit operation
(that is reverted afterwards) in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$ time was presented.
At CPM 2018, three papers studied analogously restricted dynamic variants of
problems on strings. We show that our techniques can be used to obtain fully
dynamic algorithms for several classical problems on strings, namely, computing
the longest repeat, the longest palindrome and the longest Lyndon substring of
a string. The only previously known sublinear-time dynamic algorithms for
problems on strings were obtained for maintaining a dynamic collection of
strings for comparison queries and for pattern matching with the most recent

We assume that the progenitor of 67P was a binary and consider various physical

small-scale impacts and gravitational encounters with planets. We find that 67P
could be a primordial body (i.e., not a collisional fragment) if the outer

The probability of binary collapse by impact is 30% for tightly bound binaries.
Most km-class binaries become collisionally dissolved. Roughly 10% of the
surviving binaries later evolve to become contact binaries during the disk
dispersal, when bodies suffer gravitational encounters to Neptune. Overall, the
processes described in this work do not seem to be efficient enough to explain
the large fraction (~67%) of bi-lobed cometary nuclei inferred from spacecraft

capture our uncertainty about a system's behavior using probability
distributions and update this understanding as new information becomes

be made to evaluate system performance and make decisions. While Bayesian
methods are very useful, they are often computationally intensive. This
necessitates the development of more efficient algorithms. Here, we discuss a
group of population Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for Bayesian

MCMC (ST-MCMC) algorithms. These algorithms combine 1) a notion of tempering to
gradually transform a population of samples from the prior to the posterior
through a series of intermediate distributions, 2) importance resampling, and
3) MCMC. They are a form of Sequential Monte Carlo and include algorithms like
Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Subset Simulation. We also introduce
a new sampling algorithm called the Rank-One Modified Metropolis Algorithm
(ROMMA), which builds upon the Modified Metropolis Algorithm used within Subset
Simulation to improve performance in high dimensions. Finally, we formulate a
single algorithm to solve combined Bayesian updating and reliability assessment
problems to make posterior assessments of system reliability. The algorithms
are then illustrated by performing prior and posterior reliability assessment
of a water distribution system with unknown leaks and demands.

Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL) extended with reward operators. Classical
numerical algorithms for CSL model checking based on uniformisation are limited
to finite CTMCs and suffer from the state sapce explosion problem. On the other
hand, approximate techniques such as mean-field approximations and simulations
combined with statistical inference are more scalable, but can be time
consuming and do not support the full expressiveness of CSL. In this paper we
employ a continuous-space approximation of the CTMC in terms of a Gaussian
process based on the Central Limit Approximation (CLA), also known as the
Linear Noise Approximation (LNA), whose solution requires solving a number of
differential equations that is quadratic in the number of species and
independent of the population size. We then develop efficient and scalable
approximate model checking algorithms on the resulting Gaussian process, where
we restrict the target regions for probabilistic reachability to convex
polytopes. This allows us to derive an abstraction in terms of a
time-inhomogeneous discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), whose dimension is
independent of the number of species, on which model checking is performed.
Using results from probability theory, we prove the convergence in distribution
of our algorithms to the corresponding measures on the original CTMC. We
implement the techniques and, on a set of examples, demonstrate that they allow
us to overcome the state space explosion problem, while still correctly
characterizing the stochastic behaviour of the system. Our methods can be used

Consequently, a variety of data-analytic applications have become feasible that
extract valuable insights from the data. In this paper, we address the
especially challenging problem of discovering behavior-based driving patterns
from only externally observable phenomena (e.g. vehicle's speed). We present a
trajectory segmentation approach capable of discovering driving patterns as
separate segments, based on the behavior of drivers. This segmentation approach
includes a novel transformation of trajectories along with a dynamic
programming approach for segmentation. We apply the segmentation approach on a
real-word, rich dataset of personal car trajectories provided by a major
insurance company based in Columbus, Ohio. Analysis and preliminary results
show the applicability of approach for finding significant driving patterns.

  Evaluation?","1st Workshop on Linguistic and Neuro-Cognitive Resources (LiNCR)",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years a certain success in the task of modeling lexical semantics
was obtained with distributional semantic models. Nevertheless, the scientific
community is still unaware what is the most reliable evaluation method for
these models. Some researchers argue that the only possible gold standard could
be obtained from neuro-cognitive resources that store information about human
cognition. One of such resources is eye movement data on silent reading. The
goal of this work is to test the hypothesis of whether such data could be used
to evaluate distributional semantic models on different languages. We propose
experiments with English and Russian eye movement datasets (Provo Corpus, GECO
and Russian Sentence Corpus), word vectors (Skip-Gram models trained on
national corpora and Web corpora) and word similarity datasets of Russian and
English assessed by humans in order to find the existence of correlation
between embeddings and eye movement data and test the hypothesis that this
correlation is language independent. As a result, we found that the validity of
the hypothesis being tested could be questioned.

Sylvester equations that characterize the $\mathcal{H}_2$ inner product in

$\mathcal{H}_2$ pseudo-optimal rational Krylov algorithm for ordinary
differential equations to the DAE case. This algorithm computes the globally
optimal reduced-order model for a given subspace of $\mathcal{H}_2$ defined by
poles and input residual directions. Necessary and sufficient conditions for

$\mathcal{H}_2$ inner product in terms of tangential interpolation conditions.
Based on these conditions, the cumulative reduction procedure combined with the
adaptive rational Krylov algorithm, known as CUREd SPARK, is extended to DAEs.
Important properties of this procedure are that it guarantees stability
preservation and adaptively selects interpolation frequencies and reduced
order. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the theoretical discussion.
Even though the results apply in theory to general DAEs, special structures

""style energy"" of the property can be well preserved during propagation; (b)
such regularization can be achieved by the proposed switchable TPN with
bi-directional training on pairs of frames. We apply the switchable TPN to
three tasks: colorizing a gray-scale video based on a few color key-frames,
generating an HDR video from a low dynamic range (LDR) video and a few HDR
frames, and propagating a segmentation mask from the first frame in videos.
Experimental results show that our approach is significantly more accurate and

imbalances among treatment groups, and matching methodologies alleviate this
complication by finding subsets of treatment groups that exhibit covariate
balance. It is widely agreed upon that covariate balance can serve as evidence
that a matched dataset approximates a randomized experiment, but what kind of
experiment does a matched dataset approximate? In this work, we develop a
randomization test for the hypothesis that a matched dataset approximates a
particular experimental design, such as complete randomization, block
randomization, or rerandomization. Our test can incorporate any experimental
design, and it allows for a graphical display that puts several designs on the
same univariate scale, thereby allowing researchers to pinpoint which design --
if any -- is most appropriate for a matched dataset. After researchers
determine a plausible design, we recommend a randomization-based approach for
analyzing the matched data, which can incorporate any design and treatment
effect estimator. Through simulation, we find that our test can frequently
detect violations of randomized assignment that harm inferential results.
Furthermore, through simulation and a real application in political science, we
find that matched datasets with high levels of covariate balance tend to
approximate balance-constrained designs like rerandomization, and analyzing
them as such can lead to precise causal analyses. However, assuming a precise
design should be proceeded with caution, because it can harm inferential
results if there are still substantial biases due to remaining imbalances after
matching. Our approach is implemented in the randChecks R package, available on
CRAN.

mechanism based on the steady state distribution of the underlying Markov chain
is developed for planning beyond a finite horizon in the HHV energy management

merged with the statistical model of driver behavior to increase accuracy of
the horizon optimization. The characteristics of each strategy are compared and
the benefit of learning driver behavior is analyzed through simulation on three

strain-induced buckling of the transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) lateral

along the in-plane direction. The Stillinger-Weber potential is utilized to
describe both the interaction for each TMD and the coupling between different
TMDs, i.e., MX2 (with M=Mo, W and X=S, Se, Te). It is found that the misfit
strain can induce strong buckling of the free-standing TMD lateral
heterostructures of large area, resulting from the TMDs' atomic-thick nature.
The buckling phenomenon occurs in a variety of TMD lateral heterostructures of
different compositions and in various patterns. Our findings raise a
fundamental mechanical challenge for the structural stability of the
free-standing TMD lateral heterostructures.

subject of scientific interest for many decades and a source of inspiration in
the context of reducing noise in both flapping and non-flapping flight. Here,
we characterize the near wake dynamics and associated flow structures that are
produced by flying owls. The goal is to shed light on unique flow features that
result from the owls wing morphology and its motion during forward flapping
flight. We study the wake of the southern boobook owl (Ninox boobook); a
mid-sized owl, which shares the common feature of stealthy flight. Three
individual owls were flown, separately, in a climatic avian wind tunnel at
their comfortable speed. The velocity field in the wake was sampled using
long-duration highspeed Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) while the wings
kinematics were imaged simultaneously using high speed video. The time series
of velocity maps that were acquired over several consecutive wingbeat cycles
enable us to characterize the wake patterns and associate them with the various
phases of the wingbeat cycle. Results reveal that the owls wake is
significantly different compared with other birds (western sandpiper, Calidris
mauri; European starling, Strunus vulgaris). The near wake of the owl did not
exhibit any apparent shedding of organized vortices. Instead, a more chaotic
wake pattern is observed, in which the characteristic scales of vorticity
(associated with turbulence) are substantially smaller in comparison to other
birds. Estimating the pressure field developed in the wake depicts that the owl
reduces the pressure to approximately zero. It is therefore conjectured that
owls manipulate the near wake to suppress the aeroacoustic signal by
controlling the size of vortices generated in its wake, which are associated
with noise reduction through suppression of the pressure field

substantial adaptive advantages. Here, we use hydrodynamic techniques to
investigate ""blinking,"" an unusual behavioral phenomenon observed in many
invertebrate larvae in which ciliary bands across the body rapidly change
beating direction and produce transient rearrangement of the local flow field.
Using a general theoretical model combined with quantitative experiments on
starfish larvae, we find that the natural rhythm of larval blinking is
hydrodynamically optimal for inducing strong mixing of the local fluid
environment due to transient streamline crossing, thereby maximizing the
larvae's overall feeding rate. Our results are consistent with previous
hypotheses that filter feeding organisms may use chaotic mixing dynamics to
overcome circulation constraints in viscous environments, and it suggests
physical underpinnings for complex neurally-driven behaviors in early-divergent

interest in recent years. Existing works have demonstrated that vertex
representation learned through an embedding method provides superior
performance in many real-world applications, such as node classification, link
prediction, and community detection. However, most of the existing methods for
network embedding only utilize topological information of a vertex, ignoring a
rich set of nodal attributes (such as, user profiles of an online social
network, or textual contents of a citation network), which is abundant in all
real-life networks. A joint network embedding that takes into account both
attributional and relational information entails a complete network information
and could further enrich the learned vector representations. In this work, we
present Neural-Brane, a novel Neural Bayesian Personalized Ranking based
Attributed Network Embedding. For a given network, Neural-Brane extracts latent
feature representation of its vertices using a designed neural network model

are the inclusion of $K$ and $K^*$'s in the effective Lagrangian approach and
the inclusion of processes involving the new exotic charmonium states

  We conclude that the interactions between $J/\psi$ and all the considered

gaseous halos around galaxies are a major contributor. Following Qu & Bregman
(2018), we calculate the gaseous halo contribution to the observed column
density distributions for these ions by convolving the gaseous halo model with
the observed stellar mass function. The predicted column density distribution
reproduces the general shape of the observed column density distribution -- a
broken power law with the break point at $\log N=14.0$ for {\OVI}. Our modeling
suggests that the high column density systems originate from galaxies for which
the virial temperature matches the temperature of the ionization fraction peak.
Specifically, this mass range is $\log M_\star=8.5-10$ for {\OVI}, $\log
M_\star=9.5-10.5$ for {\NeVIII}, and higher for higher ionization state ions
(assuming $T_{\rm max}=2T_{\rm vir}$). A comparison with the observed {\OVI}
column density distribution prefers a large radius model, where the maximum
radius is twice the virial radius. This model may be in conflict with the more
poorly defined {\NeVIII} column density distribution, suggesting further
observations are warranted. The redshift evolution of the high column density
systems is dominated by the change of the cosmic star formation rate, which
decreases from $z=1.0$ to the local universe. Some differences at lower columns
between our models and observations indicate that absorption by the intra-group
(cluster) medium and intergalactic medium are also contributors to the total
column density distributions.

inhomogeneous linewidth broadening in macroscopic films. We observe a minimum
full-width half-maximum linewidth of 1 mT at 10 GHz resonance frequency for a
12 nm thick film. We characterize the morphology and structure of these films
as a function of seed layer combinations and find large variation of the
qualitative behavior of the in-plane linewidth vs. resonance frequency.
Finally, we use wavevector-dependent Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy to
characterize the spin-wave dispersion at wave vectors up to 23 $\mu

new paradigm in the recent few years. NFV offers a number of benefits including
significantly increased maintainability and reduced deployment overhead.
Several works have been done to optimize deployment (also called embedding) of
virtual network functions (VNFs). However, no work to date has looked into
optimizing the selection of cloud instances for a given VNF and its specific
requirements. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of VNFs when embedded
on different Amazon EC2 cloud instances. Specifically, we evaluate three VNFs
(firewall, IDS, and NAT) in terms of arrival packet rate, resources
utilization, and packet loss. Our results indicate that performance varies
across instance types, departing from the intuition of ""you get what you pay
for"" with cloud instances. We also find out that CPU is the critical resource
for the tested VNFs, although their peak packet processing capacities differ
considerably from each other. Finally, based on the obtained results, we
identify key research challenges related to VNF instance selection and service
chain provisioning.

and electron-hole compensation has been regarded as one of the main mechanisms.
Here we present a detailed study of the angle-dependent Shubnikov -de Haas
effect on large magnetoresistance material pyrite-type PtBi$_{2}$, which allows
us to experimentally reconstruct its Fermi-surface structure and extract the
physical properties of each pocket. We find its Fermi surface contains four
types of pockets in the Brillouin zone: three ellipsoid-like hole pockets
$\alpha$ with C$_4$ symmetry located on the edges (M points), one intricate
electron pocket $\beta$ merged from four ellipsoids along [111] located on the
corners (R points), two smooth and cambered octahedrons $\gamma$ (electron) and
$\delta$ (hole) on the center ($\Gamma$ point). The deduced carrier densities
of electrons and holes from the volume of pockets prove carrier compensation.
This compensation at low temperatures is also supported by fitting the field
dependence of Hall and magnetoresistance at different temperatures. We conclude
that the compensation is the main mechanism for the large non-saturating
magnetoresistance in pyrite-type PtBi$_{2}$. We found the hole pockets {\alpha}
may contribute major mobility because of their light masses and anisotropy to
relatively avoid large-angle scattering at low temperature. This may be a
common feature of semimetals with large magnetoresistance. The found
sub-quadratic magnetoresistance in high field is probably due to
field-dependent mobilities, another feature of semimetals under high magnetic
fields.

the $Z_3$-NMSSM where the singlet $S$ and Singlino $\widetilde{S}^0$ components
play important roles in the Higgs and DM sector. Guided by our analytical

numerically investigate this dissipative behavior of QAHE in MTIs with a

the detecting electrodes and the MTI sample leads to additional scattering in
the central Hall bar, which is similar to the effect of splitting gates in the
traditional Hall effect. As a result, while the Hall resistance remains
quantized, the longitudinal resistance deviates from zero due to such
additional scattering. It is also shown that external magnetic fields as well

hypothesis that mass transfer from asymptotic giant branch stars plays an
important role in the formation of young $\alpha$-rich stars. The high

simulations of multi-scale plasma dynamics based on first-principles. However,
standard algorithms currently adopted by the plasma physics community do not
possess the long-term accuracy and fidelity required in these large-scale
simulations. This is because conventional simulation algorithms are based on
numerically solving the underpinning differential (or integro-differential)
equations, and the algorithms used in general do not preserve the geometric and
physical structures of the systems, such as the local energy-momentum
conservation law, the symplectic structure, and the gauge symmetry. As a
consequence, numerical errors accumulate coherently with time and long-term

hardness the power of exascale computers, a new generation of

generation of algorithms utilizes modern mathematical techniques, such as
discrete manifolds, interpolating differential forms, and non-canonical
symplectic integrators, to ensure gauge symmetry, space-time symmetry and the
conservation of charge, energy-momentum, and the symplectic structure. These
highly desired properties are difficult to achieve using the conventional PIC

system coexists with noise and non-essential elements. In networked systems,
for instance, some edges might be non-essential or exist only by chance.
Filtering them out and extracting a set of relevant connections, the ""network
backbone"", is a non-trivial task, and methods put forward until now do not
address time-resolved networks, whose availability has strongly increased in
recent years. We develop here such a method, by defining an adequate temporal
network null model, which calculates the random chance of nodes to be connected
at any time after controlling for their activity. This allows us to identify,
at any level of statistical significance, pairs of nodes that have more
interactions than expected given their activities: These form a backbone of
significant ties. We apply our method to empirical temporal networks of
socio-economic interest and find that (i) at given level of statistical
significance, our method identifies more significant ties than methods
considering temporally aggregated networks, and (ii) when a community structure
is present, most significant ties are intra-community edges, suggesting that
the weights of inter-community edges can be explained by the null model of
random interactions. Most importantly, our filtering method can assign a
significance to more complex structures such as triads of simultaneous
interactions, while methods based on static representations are by construction
unable to do so. Strikingly, we uncover that significant triads are not
equivalent to triangles composed by three significant edges. Our results hint
at new ways to represent temporal networks for use in data-driven models and in
anonymity-preserving ways.

achieve good performance. One may intuitively use the number of parameters
required as a rough gauge of the difficulty of a problem. But how accurate are
such notions? How many parameters are really needed? In this paper we attempt
to answer this question by training networks not in their native parameter
space, but instead in a smaller, randomly oriented subspace. We slowly increase
the dimension of this subspace, note at which dimension solutions first appear,
and define this to be the intrinsic dimension of the objective landscape. The
approach is simple to implement, computationally tractable, and produces
several suggestive conclusions. Many problems have smaller intrinsic dimensions
than one might suspect, and the intrinsic dimension for a given dataset varies
little across a family of models with vastly different sizes. This latter
result has the profound implication that once a parameter space is large enough
to solve a problem, extra parameters serve directly to increase the
dimensionality of the solution manifold. Intrinsic dimension allows some
quantitative comparison of problem difficulty across supervised, reinforcement,
and other types of learning where we conclude, for example, that solving the
inverted pendulum problem is 100 times easier than classifying digits from
MNIST, and playing Atari Pong from pixels is about as hard as classifying
CIFAR-10. In addition to providing new cartography of the objective landscapes
wandered by parameterized models, the method is a simple technique for
constructively obtaining an upper bound on the minimum description length of a
solution. A byproduct of this construction is a simple approach for compressing
networks, in some cases by more than 100 times.

functionally equivalent to the Pansini-Varandas extrapolation for large L. This
naturally leads to a simple way to extend these extrapolations to n=7 and
higher. The formula is validated by comparison with newly optimized
extrapolation factors for the AV{6,7}Z basis set pairs and literature values

since the typical sub-femtosecond electron bunches from laser-plasma
interactions either carry low beam charge, or propagate for only several tens
of femtoseconds. Here we propose an all-optical scheme for generating dense
attosecond electron bunches via the interaction of an intense Laguerre-Gaussian
(LG) laser pulse with a nanofiber. The stable bunch train results from the
unique field structure of a circularly polarized LG laser pulse, enabling each
bunch to be phase-locked and accelerated forward with low divergence, high beam
charge and large beam-angular-momentum. This paves the way for wide
applications in various fields, e.g., ultrabrilliant attosecond x/$\gamma$-ray

amorphous solids is the complex pattern of phonon transport. Recent advances in
experiments and computer simulations have indicated a crossover from Rayleigh
scattering to viscous damping. A number of theories have been proposed, yet
critical tests are missing and the validity of these theories is unclear. In
particular, the precise location of the crossover frequency remains
controversial, and more critically, even the validity of the Rayleigh
scattering itself has been seriously questioned. The present work settles these
issues by using information on the underlying vibrational eigenmodes.
Vibrational eigenmodes were recently clarified over a wide frequency regime: a
mixture of phonon modes and soft localized modes in the continuum limit and
disordered and extended modes in the boson peak regime. Here, we demonstrate
that Rayleigh scattering occurs in the continuum limit and viscous damping
occurs in the boson peak regime, and these behaviors are therefore linked to
the underlying eigenmodes in the corresponding frequency regimes. Our results
unambiguously determine the crossover frequency. Furthermore, we establish
characteristic scaling laws of phonon transport, which are consistent with the
prediction of the mean-field theory at higher frequencies but inconsistent in
the low-frequency, Rayleigh scattering regime. Our results therefore reveal
crucial issues to be solved with regard to the current theory.

that there is a great difference in oxidation rate between the Si-face and
C-face, and that the quality of oxide on the Si-face is greater than that on
the C-face. However, the atomistic mechanism of the thermal oxidation of SiC
remains to be solved. In this paper, a new Si-C-O interatomic potential was
developed to reproduce the kinetics of the thermal oxidation of SiC. Using this
newly developed potential, large-scale SiC oxidation simulations at various
temperature were performed. The results showed that the activation energy of
the Si-face is much larger than that of the C-face. In the case of the Si-face,
a flat and aligned interface structure including Si${}^{1+}$ was created. Based
on the estimated activation energies of the intermediate oxide states, it is
proposed that the stability of the flat interface structure is the origin of
the high activation energy of the oxidation of the Si-face. In contrast, in the
case of the C-face, it is found that the Si atom at the interface are easily
pulled up by the O atoms. This process generates the disordered interface and
decreases the activation energy of the oxidation. It is also proposed that many
excess C atoms are created in the case of the C-face.

generally the primary choices in many applications. In spite of their merits,
those methods are not feasible due to intractable computation when the sample

Gaussian process based models, by separating the original dataset into
tractable subsets. This method consistently combines parameter estimation and
prediction by making full use of the dependence among conditional densities: a
statistically efficient composite likelihood based on joint distributions of
some well selected conditional densities is developed to estimate parameters
and then ""composite inference"" is coined to make prediction for an unknown
input point, based on its distributions conditional on each block subset. The
proposed method transforms the intractable BLUP into a tractable convex

in very large systems as the jamming transition is approached and the pressure
p vanishes. We find that these modes consist of an unstable core in which

far-field component which increases the energy and prevents the buckling of the
core. The size of the core diverges as $p^{-1/4}$ and its characteristic volume
as $p^{-1/2}$ These features are precisely those of the anomalous modes known
to cause the Boson peak in the vibrational spectrum of weakly-coordinated

in agreement with previous observations. Our analysis thus unravels the nature

vertices, is a bijection $f:E(G) \rightarrow \{1,2,\ldots , |E(G)|\}$ such that
for any two adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$, the condition $\omega _{f}(u)
\neq \omega _{f}(v)$ holds; where $\omega _{f}(u)=\sum _{x\in N(u)} f(xu)$.
Assigning $\omega _{f}(u)$ to $u$ for each vertex $u$ in $V(G)$, induces
naturally a proper vertex coloring of $G$; and $|f|$ denotes the number of
colors appearing in this proper vertex coloring. The {\it local antimagic
chromatic number} of $G$, denoted by $\chi _{la}(G)$, is defined as the minimum
of $|f|$, where $f$ ranges over all local antimagic labelings of $G$. In this
paper, we explicitely construct an infinite class of connected graphs $G$ such
that $\chi _{la}(G)$ can be arbitrarily large while $\chi _{la}(G \vee
\bar{K_{2}})=3$, where $G \vee \bar{K_{2}}$ is the join graph of $G$ and the
complement graph of $K_{2}$. This fact leads to a counterexample to a theorem

direction and offer a direct view of their central X-ray engine. If most of
X-ray photons have traveled from the primary source to the observer with
minimum light-matter interaction, a fraction of radiation is emitted at
different directions and is reprocessed by the parsec-scale equatorial
circumnuclear region or the polar outflows. It is still unclear how much the
polarization expected from type-1 AGN is affected by radiation that have
scattered on the distant AGN components. In this paper, we examine the
contribution of remote material onto the polarized X-ray spectrum of type-1
Seyfert galaxies using radiative transfer Monte Carlo codes. We find that the
observed X-ray polarization strongly depends on the initial polarization
emerging from the disk-corona system. For unpolarized and parallelly polarized
photons (parallel to the disk), the contribution is negligible below 3 keV and
tends to increase the polarization degree by up to one percentage points at
higher energies, smoothing out the energy-dependent variations of the
polarization angle. For perpendicularly polarized corona photons, the addition
of the circumnuclear scattered (parallel) component adds to the polarization
above 10 keV, decreases polarization below 10 keV and shifts the expected 90
deg rotation of the polarization angle to lower energies. In conclusion, we
found that simulations of Seyfert-1s that do not account for reprocessing on
the parsec-scale equatorial and polar material are under- or over-estimating
the X-ray polarization by 0.1 - 1 percentage points.

${\approx}300M_{\odot}$ of material in order to explain multiple populations;
over a period of $3Myr$ this corresponds to $ \sim10^{-4} M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$

under strong-coupling conditions dephasing leads to a transfer of energy
between the constituted polariton branches $|\pm\rangle$. When the polariton
dephasing is properly accounted for, the transition from the upper to the lower
polariton branch is favored and leads to a dominant population of the lower
polariton branch under coherent pumping conditions. As a result, the inelastic
light emission originates mainly from the lower polariton state regardless of
the pumping laser frequency thus producing an asymmetric emission of light.
Furthermore, we show that, when several molecules are considered,
inter-molecular coupling breaks the symmetry of the system, making the
originally dark polaritons to effectively interact with light. This effect is
revealed in the fluorescence spectrum as new emission peaks.

understanding the penetration of roots in soils and optimizing crop. Yet the
mechanical properties of plant roots depend on their water content, which can
drastically evolve with drying or flooding of the external soil. The present
work deals with the determination of the longitudinal Young's modulus of single
non-lignified plant roots, chick-peas (Cicer arietinum L.), tested in
compression along their root axis for different external environments: in
controlled conditions of natural drying in air or in a osmotic solution of
mannitol at the isotonic concentration where no water exchange occurs between
the root and the external solution. We submitted the chick-pea radicles to
successive mechanical compression cycles separated by rest periods to follow
the time evolution of the root mechanical properties in drying and non-drying
environments. Control experiments on non-drying roots placed in isotonic
osmotic solutions showed no evolution of the root's Young's modulus whose value
was around 2 MPa. On the contrary, the experiments performed in air exhibited a
dramatic increase of the root's Young's modulus with the drying time, sometimes
by a factor of 35. Moreover, the Young's modulus in these cases was observed to
scale as a decaying power-law with the root's cross section measured at
diffrent times of drying. We interpreted our results in the framework of the
mechanics of cellular foams.

finite set of connected graphs F, the F-Deletion problem is the following:
given a graph G and integer k, is it possible to delete k vertices from G to
ensure the resulting graph does not contain any graph from F as a minor?
Earlier work by Fomin, Lokshtanov, Misra, and Saurabh [FOCS'12] showed that
when F contains a planar graph, an instance (G,k) can be reduced in polynomial
time to an equivalent one of size $k^{O(1)}$. In this work we focus on
structural measures of the complexity of an instance, with the aim of giving
nontrivial preprocessing guarantees for instances whose solutions are large.
Motivated by several impossibility results, we parameterize the F-Deletion
problem by the size of a vertex modulator whose removal results in a graph of
constant treedepth $\eta$.
  We prove that for each set F of connected graphs and constant $\eta$, the
F-Deletion problem parameterized by the size of a treedepth-$\eta$ modulator
has a polynomial kernel. Our kernelization is fully explicit and does not
depend on protrusion reduction or well-quasi-ordering, which are sources of
algorithmic non-constructivity in earlier works on F-Deletion. Our main
technical contribution is to analyze how models of a forbidden minor in a graph
G with modulator X, interact with the various connected components of G-X. By
bounding the number of different types of behavior that can occur by a
polynomial in |X|, we obtain a polynomial kernel using a recursive
preprocessing strategy. Our results extend earlier work for specific instances
of F-Deletion such as Vertex Cover and Feedback Vertex Set. It also generalizes
earlier preprocessing results for F-Deletion parameterized by a vertex cover,

the ensemble may lack diversity and collapse to a low-dimensional subspace. To
still benefit from the breeding method's simplicity and its low computational

ensembles. We present here such a method tailored for multi-scale systems. We
describe how to judiciously introduce stochastic perturbations to the standard
bred vectors leading to stochastically perturbed bred vectors. The increased
diversity leads to a better forecast skill as measured by the RMS error, as
well as to more reliable ensembles quantified by the error-spread relationship,
the continuous ranked probability score and reliability diagrams. Our approach
is dynamically informed and in effect generates random draws from the fast

to functionalize surfaces chemically for a wide variety of applications.
Scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs) are important instruments in this area
used to measure the surface structure and chemistry with better than molecular
resolution. Self-assembly is frequently used to create monolayers that redefine
the surface chemistry in just a single-molecule-thick layer. Indeed, STM images
reveal rich information about the structure of self-assembled monolayers since
they convey chemical and physical properties of the studied material.
  In order to assist in and to enhance the analysis of STM and other images, we
propose and demonstrate an image-processing framework that produces two image
segmentations: one is based on intensities (apparent heights in STM images) and
the other is based on textural patterns. The proposed framework begins with a
cartoon+texture decomposition, which separates an image into its cartoon and
texture components. Afterward, the cartoon image is segmented by a modified
multiphase version of the local Chan-Vese model, while the texture image is
segmented by a combination of 2D empirical wavelet transform and a clustering
algorithm. Overall, our proposed framework contains several new features,
specifically in presenting a new application of cartoon+texture decomposition
and of the empirical wavelet transforms and in developing a specialized
framework to segment STM images and other data. To demonstrate the potential of
our approach, we apply it to actual STM images of cyanide monolayers on
Au\{111\} and present their corresponding segmentation results.

is actually a diffraction grating in which the amplitude of all the modes is
negligible except the one traveling towards the desired direction. A supercell
of drilled holes in an acoustically rigid surface is proposed as the basic unit
cell, and analytical expressions for an inverse diffraction problem are
derived. It is found that the the number of holes required for the realization
of an anomalous reflector is equal to the number of diffracted modes to cancel,

angles. Then, the ""retrorreflection"" effect is obtained by just one hole per
unit cell, also with only two holes it is possible to change the reflection
angle of a normally incident wave and five holes are enough to design a general
retroreflector changing the incident and reflected angles at oblique incidence.
Finally, the concept of Snell's law violation is extended not only to the
incident and reflected angles, but also to the plane in which it happens, and a
device based on a single hole in a square lattice is designed in such a way
that the reflection plane is rotated $\pi/4$ with respect to the plane of
incidence. Numerical simulations are performed to support the predictions of

which basically includes lowest lying scalar and pseudoscalar mesons. Our new

Performing iterative Monte Carlo simulations, it is found that among the three
candidates of scalar glueball, i.e., $f_0(1370)$, $f_0(1500)$ and $f_0(1710)$,
only $f_0(1500)$ is predominately a glueball state with the mass prediction of
$1.566 \pm 0.046$ GeV and the other two are predominately quarkonium. The
$\pi\pi$, $\pi K$ and $\pi \eta$ scatterings are reinvestigated in the presence
of scalar glueball and it is found that the overall behavior of the real part
of the K-matrix unitarized $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude is more compatible

also presented the predictions of the model for the masses and decay widths of
the scalars obtained from the poles of the K-matrix unitarized $\pi\pi$, $\pi

shift predicted by our model is compared with the prediction of generalized
linear sigma model (GLSM) which contains two nonets of scalar mesons and two
nonets of pseudoscalar mesons (a quark-antiquark nonet and a four-quark nonet).
Despite the fact that at this stage our model lacks the second meson nonet

muon pairs in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV in the
intermediate transverse momentum range $2 < p_{\rm T} < 5$ GeV/$c$ and in the
rapidity interval $2.5<y<4$. The $\phi$ yield was measured as a function of the
transverse momentum and collision centrality. The nuclear modification factor
was obtained as a function of the average number of participating nucleons.
Results were compared with the ones obtained via the kaon decay channel in the
same $p_{\rm T}$ range at midrapidity. The values of the nuclear modification
factor in the two rapidity regions are in agreement within uncertainties.

safety-critical systems. It is a highly cooperative task among multiple
functional departments due to increasingly sophisticated safety-critical
systems and close-knit development processes. Communication occurs pervasively.
Motivation: Effective communication channels among multiple functional
departments influence safety analysis, quality as well as a safe product
delivery. However, the use of communication channels during safety analysis is
sometimes arbitrary and poses challenges. Objective: Investige the existing
communication channels, their usage frequencies, their purposes and challenges
during safety analysis in industry.. Method: Multiple case study of experts
(survey: 39, interview: 21) in safety-critical companies including software
developers, quality engineers and functional safety managers. Direct
observations and documentation review were also conducted. Results: Popular
communication channels during safety analysis include formal meetings, project
coordination tools, documentation and telephone. Email, personal discussion,
training, internal communication software and boards are also in use. Training
involving safety analysis happens 1-4 times per year, while other
aforementioned communication channels happen ranges from 1-4 times per day to
1-4 times per month. We summarise 28 purposes for these communication channels.
Communication happens mostly for the purpose of clarifying safety requirements,
fixing temporary problems, conflicts and obstacles and sharing safety
knowledge. The top challenges are reported. Conclusion: During safety analysis,
to use communication channels effectively and avoid challenges, a clear purpose
of communication during safety analysis should be established at the beginning.
To derive countermeasures of fixing the top 10 challenges are potential next
steps.

verification (ASV) system. We present an evaluation of the effectiveness of age
stereotypes as a voice disguise strategy, as a follow up to our recent work
where 60 native Finnish speakers attempted to sound like an elderly and like a
child. In that study, we presented evidence that both ASV and human observers
could easily miss the target speaker but we did not address how believable the
presented vocal age stereotypes were; this study serves to fill that gap. The
interesting cases would be speakers who succeed in being missed by the ASV
system, and which a typical listener cannot detect as being a disguise. We
carry out a perceptual test to study the quality of the disguised speech
samples. The listening test was carried out both locally and with the help of
Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MT) crowd-workers. A total of 91 listeners
participated in the test and were instructed to estimate both the speaker's
chronological and intended age. The results indicate that age estimations for
the intended old and child voices for female speakers were towards the target
age groups, while for male speakers, the age estimations corresponded to the
direction of the target voice only for elderly voices. In the case of intended
child's voice, listeners estimated the age of male speakers to be older than
their chronological age for most of the speakers and not the intended target
age.

self-dual type (i.e., if $G$ is isomorphic to its dual $G^*$), the model has a

coupled to an external heat bath, are popular methods for temperature control
in molecular dynamics simulations due to their ergodicity and their ease of
implementation. Traditionally, these thermostats suffer from sluggish behaviour
in the limit of high friction, unlike thermostats of the Nos\'e-Hoover family
whose performance degrades more gently in the strong coupling regime. We
propose a simple and easy-to-implement modification to the integration scheme
of the Langevin algorithm that addresses the fundamental source of the
overdamped behaviour of high-friction Langevin dynamics: if the action of the
thermostat causes the momentum of a particle to change direction, it is flipped
back. This fast-forward Langevin equation preserves the momentum distribution,
and so guarantees the correct equilibrium sampling. It mimics the quadratic
behavior of Nos\'e-Hoover thermostats, and displays similarly good performance
in the strong coupling limit. We test the efficiency of this scheme by applying
it to a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator, as well as to water and
Lennard-Jones polymers. The sampling efficiency of the fast-forward Langevin
equation thermostat, measured by the correlation time of relevant system
variables, is at least as good as the traditional Langevin thermostat, and in
the overdamped regime the fast-forward thermostat performs much better,
improving the efficiency by an order of magnitude at the highest frictions we

that systems behave correctly and are well protected against security risks.
Runtime enforcement is a dynamic analysis technique that utilizes software
monitors to check the runtime behaviour of a software system with respect to a
correctness specification. Whenever the runtime behaviour of the monitored
system is about to deviate from the specification (either due to a programming
bug or a security hijack attack), the monitors apply enforcement techniques to
prevent this deviation.
  Current Runtime Enforcement techniques require that the correctness
specification defines the behaviour of the enforcement monitor itself. This
burdens the specifier with not only having to define property that needs to be
enforced, but also with having to specify how this should be enforced at
runtime; we thus relieve the specifier from this burden by resorting to a
highly expressive logic. Using a logic we allow the specifier to define the
correctness specification as a logic formula from which we can automatically
synthesise the appropriate enforcement monitor.
  Highly expressive logics can, however, permit for defining a wide variety of
formulae, some of which cannot actually be enforced correctly at runtime. We
thus study the enforceability of Hennessy Milner Logic with Recursion for which
we identify a subset that allows for defining enforceable formulae. This allows
us to define a synthesis function that translates enforceable formulae into
enforcement monitors. As our monitors are meant to ensure the correct behaviour
of the monitored system, it is imperative that they work correctly themselves.
We thus study formal definitions that allow us to ensure that our enforcement
monitors behave correctly.

layer of magnetically confined plasmas is desired to accurately model the
lifetime of the vacuum vessel components. Mirror Langmuir probes (MLPs) are a
novel diagnostic that uniquely allow to sample the plasma parameters on a time
scale shorter than the characteristic time scale of their fluctuations. Sudden
large-amplitude fluctuations in the plasma degrade the precision and accuracy
of the plasma parameters reported by MLPs for cases in which the probe bias
range is of insufficient amplitude. While some data samples can readily be
classified as valid and invalid, we find that such a classification may be
ambiguous for up to 40% of data sampled for the plasma parameters and bias
voltages considered in this study. In this contribution we employ an
autoencoder (AE) to learn a low-dimensional representation of valid data
samples. By definition, the coordinates in this space are the features that
mostly characterize valid data. Ambiguous data samples are classified in this
space using standard classifiers for vectorial data. This way, we avoid to
define complicate threshold rules to identify outliers, which requires strong
assumptions and introduce biases in the analysis. Instead, these rules are
learned from the data by statistical inference By removing the outliers that
are identified in the latent low-dimensional space of the AE, we find that the
average conductive and convective radial heat flux are between approximately 5
and 15% lower as when removing outliers identified by threshold values. For
contributions to the radial heat flux due to triple correlations, the
difference is up to 40%.

the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we utilize synthetic spectra of
simulated EoR galaxies from cosmological simulations together with synthetic
spectra of partially quenched mock galaxies. We find that rapid declines in the
SFR of EoR galaxies could seriously affect the applicability of methods that
utilize the equivalent width of Balmer lines and the ultraviolet spectral slope
to assess the escape fraction of EoR galaxies. In order to determine if the
aforementioned degeneracy can be avoided by using the overall shape of the

significant decrease in the SFR (by a factor 10-100) in the past 50-100 Myr

various fields including astrophysics. To date, simulation softwares have been
developed by individual researchers or research groups in each field, with a
huge amount of time and effort, even though numerical algorithms used are very
similar. To improve the situation, we have developed a framework, called FDPS,
which enables researchers to easily develop massively parallel particle
simulation codes for arbitrary particle methods. Until version 3.0, FDPS have
provided API only for C++ programing language. This limitation comes from the
fact that FDPS is developed using the template feature in C++, which is
essential to support arbitrary data types of particle. However, there are many
researchers who use Fortran to develop their codes. Thus, the previous versions
of FDPS require such people to invest much time to learn C++. This is
inefficient. To cope with this problem, we newly developed a Fortran interface
layer in FDPS, which provides API for Fortran. In order to support arbitrary
data types of particle in Fortran, we design the Fortran interface layer as
follows. Based on a given derived data type in Fortran representing particle, a
Python script provided by us automatically generates a library that manipulates
the C++ core part of FDPS. This library is seen as a Fortran module providing
API of FDPS from the Fortran side and uses C programs internally to
interoperate Fortran with C++. In this way, we have overcome several technical
issues when emulating `template' in Fortran. By using the Fortran interface,
users can develop all parts of their codes in Fortran. We show that the
overhead of the Fortran interface part is sufficiently small and a code written
in Fortran shows a performance practically identical to the one written in C++.

using local search heuristic. Obtaining a constant factor approximation for the
\ckm problem is open. All the existing solutions giving constant-factor
approximation, violate at least one of the cardinality and the capacity
constraints. All except Koruplou et al are based on LP-relaxation.
  We give $(3+\epsilon)$ factor approximation algorithm for the problem
violating the cardinality by a factor of $8/3 \approx 2.67$. There is a
trade-off between the approximation factor and the cardinality violation
between our work and the existing work. Koruplou et al gave $(1 + \alpha)$
approximation factor with $(5 + 5/\alpha)$ factor loss in cardinality using
local search paradigm. Though the approximation factor can be made arbitrarily
small, cardinality loss is at least $5$.
  On the other hand, we improve upon the results in
[capkmGijswijtL2013],[capkmshili2014], [Lisoda2016] in terms of factor-loss
though the cardinality loss is more in our case. Also, these results are
obtained using LP-rounding, some of them being strengthened, whereas local
search techniques are simple to apply and have been shown to perform well in
practice via empirical studies.
  We extend the result to hard uniform capacitated $k$-median with penalties.
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first result for the problem.

unless the parameters of the model are fine-tuned. For the XY phase, this
corresponds to a conducting fixed point where the conductance agrees with the

similarly leads to an unsuppressed spin current with a linear current-voltage

there occurs a sharp crossover to a region where a current-voltage

multiple point clouds sampled from unknown densities with support in a
d-dimensional Euclidean space. This work is motivated by applications in
bioinformatics where researchers aim to automatically homogenize large datasets
to compare and analyze characteristics within a same cell population.
Inconveniently, the information acquired is most certainly noisy due to
mis-alignment caused by technical variations of the environment. To overcome
this problem, we propose to register multiple point clouds by using the notion
of regularized barycenters (or Fr\'{e}chet mean) of a set of probability
measures with respect to the Wasserstein metric. A first approach consists in
penalizing a Wasserstein barycenter with a convex functional as recently
proposed in Bigot and al. (2018). A second strategy is to transform the
Wasserstein metric itself into an entropy regularized transportation cost
between probability measures as introduced in Cuturi (2013). The main
contribution of this work is to propose data-driven choices for the
regularization parameters involved in each approach using the
Goldenshluger-Lepski's principle. Simulated data sampled from Gaussian mixtures
are used to illustrate each method, and an application to the analysis of flow
cytometry data is finally proposed. This way of choosing of the regularization
parameter for the Sinkhorn barycenter is also analyzed through the prism of an
oracle inequality that relates the error made by such data-driven estimators to
the one of an ideal estimator.

degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel CF-based optimization
problem to jointly model the discrimination and reliability information. First,
we treat the filter as the element-wise product of a base filter and a
reliability term. The base filter is aimed to learn the discrimination
information between the target and backgrounds, and the reliability term
encourages the final filter to focus on more reliable regions. Second, we
introduce a local response consistency regular term to emphasize equal
contributions of different regions and avoid the tracker being dominated by
unreliable regions. The proposed optimization problem can be solved using the
alternating direction method and speeded up in the Fourier domain. We conduct
extensive experiments on the OTB-2013, OTB-2015 and VOT-2016 datasets to

framework, which is not limited to e.g. differential games and could
accommodate both discrete and continuous time. Assuming common dynamics, we
study two game families with total payoffs that are defined either as the
Ces\`{a}ro average (long run average game family) or Abel average (discounting
game family) of the running costs. We study a robust strategy that would
provide a near-optimal total payoff for all sufficiently small discounts and
for all sufficiently large planning horizons. Assuming merely the Dynamic
Programming Principle, we prove the following Tauberian theorem: if a strategy
is uniformly optimal for one of the families (when discount goes to zero for
discounting games, when planning horizon goes to infinity in long run average
games) and its value functions converge uniformly, then, for the other family,
this strategy is also uniformly optimal and its value functions converge
uniformly to the same limit.

become an important test case for understanding the existence and stability of
ice-rule states in general. The standard model of spin ice - the dipolar spin
ice model - predicts an ordering transition at $T\approx 0.15$ K, but recent
experiments by Pomaranski $et\ al.$ suggest an entropy recovery over long time
scales at temperatures as high as $0.5$ K, much too high to be compatible with
theory. Using neutron scattering and specific heat measurements at low
temperatures and with long time scales ($0.35$ K$/10^6$ s and $0.5$ K$/10^5$ s
respectively) on several isotopically enriched samples we find no evidence of a
reduction of ice-rule correlations or spin entropy. High-resolution simulations
of the neutron structure factor show that the spin correlations remain well
described by the dipolar spin ice model at all temperatures. Further, by
careful consideration of hyperfine contributions, we conclude that the original
entropy measurements of Ramirez $et\ al.$ are, after all, essentially correct:
the short-time relaxation method used in that study gives a reasonably accurate
estimate of the equilibrium spin ice entropy due to a cancellation of

mainly, medicine, particle physics and astrophysics. Traditionally, they are
coupled to a photo-multplier (PMT) but now silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM) are
evolving as a promising robust alternative, specially in space born experiments
since plastic scintillators may be a light option for low Earth orbit missions.
Therefore it is timely to make a new analysis of the optimal design for
experiments based on plastic scintillators in realistic conditions in such a
configuration.
  We analyze here their response to an isotropic flux of electron and proton
primaries in the energy range from 1 MeV to 1 GeV, a typical scenario for
cosmic ray or space weather experiments, through detailed GEANT4 simulations.
First, we focus on the effect of increasing the ratio between the plastic
volume and the area of the photo-detector itself and, second, on the benefits
of using a reflective coating around the plastic, the most common technique to
increase light collection efficiency. In order to achieve a general approach,
it is necessary to consider several detector setups. Therefore, we have
performed a full set of simulations using the highly tested GEANT4 simulation
tool: several parameters have been analyzed such as the energy lost in the
coating, the deposited energy in the scintillator, the optical absorption, the
fraction of scintillation photons that are not detected, the light collection
at the photo-detector, the pulse shape and its time parameters and finally,
other design parameters as the surface roughness, the coating reflectivity and
the case of a scintillator with two decay components. This work could serve as
a guide on the design of future experiments based on the use of plastic
scintillators.

$\{\ell\leq x \leq u\}$ is integer. We define principally box-integer polyhedra
to be the polyhedra $P$ such that $kP$ is box-integer whenever $kP$ is integer.
We characterize them in several ways, involving equimodular matrices and
box-total dual integral (box-TDI) systems. A rational $r\times n$ matrix is
equimodular if it has full row rank and its nonzero $r\times r$ determinants
all have the same absolute value. A face-defining matrix is a full row rank
matrix describing the affine hull of a face of the polyhedron. Box-TDI systems
are systems which yield strong min-max relations, and the underlying polyhedron
is called a box-TDI polyhedron. Our main result is that the following
statements are equivalent.
  - The polyhedron $P$ is principally box-integer.
  - The polyhedron $P$ is box-TDI.
  - Every face-defining matrix of $P$ is equimodular.
  - Every face of $P$ has an equimodular face-defining matrix.
  - Every face of $P$ has a totally unimodular face-defining matrix.
  - For every face $F$ of $P$, lin($F$) has a totally unimodular basis.
  Along our proof, we show that a cone $\{x:Ax\leq \mathbf{0}\}$ is box-TDI if
and only if it is box-integer, and that these properties are passed on to its
polar.
  We illustrate the use of these characterizations by reviewing well known
results about box-TDI polyhedra. We also provide several applications. The
first one is a new perspective on the equivalence between two results about
binary clutters. Secondly, we refute a conjecture of Ding, Zang, and Zhao about
box-perfect graphs. Thirdly, we discuss connections with an abstract class of
polyhedra having the Integer Carath\'eodory Property. Finally, we characterize
the box-TDIness of the cone of conservative functions of a graph and provide a
corresponding box-TDI system.

the running time of well-known algorithms for fundamental problems by
logarithmic factors. For example, the $O(n^2)$ dynamic programming solution to
the Longest Common Subsequence problem (LCS) was improved to $O(n^2/\log^2 n)$
in several ways and using a variety of ingenious tricks. This line of research,
also known as ""the art of shaving log factors"", lacks a tool for proving
negative results. Specifically, how can we show that it is unlikely that LCS
can be solved in time $O(n^2/\log^3 n)$?
  Perhaps the only approach for such results was suggested in a recent paper of
Abboud, Hansen, Vassilevska W. and Williams (STOC'16). The authors blame the
hardness of shaving logs on the hardness of solving satisfiability on Boolean
formulas (Formula-SAT) faster than exhaustive search. They show that an
$O(n^2/\log^{1000} n)$ algorithm for LCS would imply a major advance in circuit
lower bounds. Whether this approach can lead to tighter barriers was unclear.
  In this paper, we push this approach to its limit and, in particular, prove
that a well-known barrier from complexity theory stands in the way for shaving
five additional log factors for fundamental combinatorial problems. For LCS,
regular expression pattern matching, as well as the Fr\'echet distance problem
from Computational Geometry, we show that an $O(n^2/\log^{7+\varepsilon} n)$
runtime would imply new Formula-SAT algorithms.
  Our main result is a reduction from SAT on formulas of size $s$ over $n$
variables to LCS on sequences of length $N=2^{n/2} \cdot s^{1+o(1)}$. Our
reduction is essentially as efficient as possible, and it greatly improves the
previously known reduction for LCS with $N=2^{n/2} \cdot s^c$, for some $c \geq
100$.

while intermediate or high density tracers show (on average) a tendency for
alignment perpendicular to the magnetic field. This observation agrees with
previous studies of the change in relative orientation with column density in
Vela C, and supports a model where the magnetic field is strong enough to have
influenced the formation of dense gas structures within Vela C. The transition
from parallel to no preferred/perpendicular orientation appears to happen
between the densities traced by $^{13}$CO and by C$^{18}$O $J$ $\rightarrow$ 1

we present computational approaches for upper and lower bounds for the SSP
problem: (a)~for computing upper bounds, our method is polynomial-time in the
implicit description of the MDP; (b)~for lower bounds, we present a
polynomial-time (in the size of the implicit description) reduction to
quadratic programming. Our approach is applicable even to infinite-state MDPs.
Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach on several classical examples from the AI literature.

distributed across various heterogeneous data sources at the scale of the
Internet. An eager ETL process constructs an integrated data repository as its
first step, integrating and loading data in its entirety from the data sources.
The bootstrapping of this process is not efficient for scientific research that
requires access to data from very large and typically numerous distributed data
sources. a lazy ETL process loads only the metadata, but still eagerly. Lazy
ETL is faster in bootstrapping. However, queries on the integrated data
repository of eager ETL perform faster, due to the availability of the entire
data beforehand.
  In this paper, we propose a novel ETL approach for scientific data
integration, as a hybrid of eager and lazy ETL approaches, and applied both to
data as well as metadata. This way, Hybrid ETL supports incremental integration
and loading of metadata and data from the data sources. We incorporate a
human-in-the-loop approach, to enhance the hybrid ETL, with selective data
integration driven by the user queries and sharing of integrated data between
users. We implement our hybrid ETL approach in a prototype platform, Obidos,
and evaluate it in the context of data sharing for medical research. Obidos
outperforms both the eager ETL and lazy ETL approaches, for scientific research
data integration and sharing, through its selective loading of data and
metadata, while storing the integrated data in a scalable integrated data
repository.

a efficient operation in this fusion framework. Finally, the fused image is
obtained by combining the fused low-rank part and the fused salient part.

resource allocation process, in which each step corresponds to a different
level of allocating resources, i.e., zone and user levels. We initially define
both zones in terms of the physical area and the amount of allocated resources
and we investigate the impact of illumination requirements on defining both
zones. Through simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme
in terms of the area spectral efficiency and the fairness level between the two
zones. We show that both performance measures can be potentially enhanced by
carefully setting a certain design parameter that reflects the priority level
of the users located in the region around the cell center, denoted as Zone 0,
in terms of the achievable rate. We further eventuate the system performance in
a realistic transmission scenario using a simulation tool.

are conceived for finding more accurate data representations from the original

2) large short term memory and 3) low execution time. Echo State Network (ESN)
is a recent specific kind of Recurrent Neural Network which presents very rich
dynamics thanks to its reservoir-based hidden layer. It is widely used in
dealing with complex non-linear problems and it has outperformed classical
approaches in a number of tasks including regression, classification, etc. In
this paper, the noticeable dynamism and the large memory provided by ESN and
the strength of Autoencoders in feature extraction are gathered within an ESN
Recurrent Autoencoder (ESN-RAE). In order to bring up sturdier alternative to
conventional reservoir-based networks, not only single layer basic ESN is used
as an autoencoder, but also Multi-Layer ESN (ML-ESN-RAE). The new features,
once extracted from ESN's hidden layer, are applied to classification tasks.
The classification rates rise considerably compared to those obtained when
applying the original data features. An accuracy-based comparison is performed
between the proposed recurrent AEs and two variants of an ELM feed-forward AEs
(Basic and ML) in both of noise free and noisy environments. The empirical
study reveals the main contribution of recurrent connections in improving the
classification performance results.

considering the almost parity-degenerate vector meson final states by
exploiting the opposite relative sign of left- versus right-handed amplitudes.
For example, measuring the time-dependent rates of a pair of vector
$V(J^P=1^-)$ and axial $A(1^+)$ mesons in $B \to (V,A) \gamma$, up to an order

clean probes to null tests, from the theory side.

crystal approach for the first time. It is found that the magnetic effect plays
the role of a catalyzer for the topological phase transition (topological
deformation for the skyrmion crystal configuration from the skrymion phase to
half-skyrmion phase). Furthermore, we observe that in the presence of the
magnetic field, the inhomogeneous chiral condensate persists both in the
skyrmion and half-skyrmion phases. Explicitly, as the strength of magnetic
field gets larger, the inhomogeneous chiral condensate in the skyrmion phase
tends to be drastically localized, while in the half-skyrmion phase the
inhomogeneity configuration is hardly affected. It also turns out that a large
magnetic effect in a low density region distorts the baryon shape to an
elliptic form but the crystal structure is intact. However, in a high density
region, the crystal structure is strongly effected by the strong magnetic
field. A possible correlation between the chiral inhomogeneity and the

are perturbed by a time-dependent negative-energy perturbation, their interior
can be partially revealed. In the SYK model, a partial measurement of the state
of the Majorana fermion pairs allows one to construct a matching time-dependent
negative-energy perturbation of the BH geometry that shifts the state of the BH
away from its equilibrium state. Kourkoulou and Maldacena showed that, if the
perturbation is strong enough, the interior can be fully exposed and the BH
disappears. Here, we show that when the perturbation is weaker than the
threshold for full exposure, it effectively moves the horizon of the BH
inwards, thus partially exposing the interior of the BH and leaving behind a
smaller BH. The exposure is in proportion to the number of measured Majorana
pairs and so also in proportion to the magnitude of the energy of the
perturbation. From the boundary, the partial measurement is perceived as a
burst of radiation whose strength and duration are proportional to the number
of measured Majorana pairs.

higher rate than that by the transmitter farther from the receiver. Hence, to
induce fairness among transmitters, we consider the minimumrate maximization

induced by the accumulation of particles at the contact line plays an important
role in the formation of the deposition. In this paper, we investigate both
numerically and theoretically, the effect of friction between the particles and
the substrate on the deposition pattern. Without friction, the contact line
shows a stick-slip behaviour and a dot-like deposit is left after the droplet
is evaporated. By increasing the friction force, we observe a transition from a
dot-like to a ring-like deposit. We propose a theoretical model to predict the
effective radius of the particle deposition as a function of the friction
force. Our theoretical model predicts a critical friction force when the
self-pinning happens and the effective radius of deposit increases with
increasing friction force, confirmed by our simulation results. Our results can

function of light intensity is often used as a means to identify the dominant
recombination mechanism in solar cells. However, applying this Suns-VOC
technique to perovskite cells is problematic since the VOC evolves with time in
a way which depends on the previously applied bias (Vpre), the light intensity,
and the device architecture/processing. Here we show that the dominant
recombination mechanism in two structurally similar CH3NH3PbI3 devices
containing either mesoporous Al2O3 or TiO2 layers can be identified from the
signature of the transient ideality factor following application of a forward
bias, Vpre, to the device in the dark. The transient ideality factor, is
measured by monitoring the temporal evolution of VOC at different light
intensities. The initial values of the transient ideality were consistent with
corresponding photoluminescence vs intensity as well as electroluminescence vs
current density measurements. Time-dependent simulations of the measurement on
modelled devices, which include the effects of mobile ionic charge, show that
Shockley Read Hall (SRH) recombination through deep traps at the charge
collection interfaces is dominant in both devices. Using transient photovoltage
measurements superimposed on the evolving VOC of bifacial devices we further
show that the charge collection interface extends throughout the mesoporous
TiO2 layer, consistent with a transient ideality signature corresponding to SRH
recombination in the bulk of the film. This information could not be inferred
from an ideality factor determined from only steady-state VOC values. The
method we have developed will be useful for identifying performance bottlenecks
in new variants of perovskite devices by comparison with the transient ideality
signatures we have predicted for a range of possible recombination schemes.

representations of finite groups. In particular, we generalize the categorical
character theory of Ganter--Kapranov and Bartlett to the Real setting. Given a
Real representation of a group $\mathsf{G}$, or more generally a finite
categorical group, on a linear category, we associate a number, the modified
secondary trace, to each graded commuting pair $(g, \omega) \in \mathsf{G}

$2$-character of the Real representation. We also define various forms of
induction for Real representations of finite categorical groups and compute the
result at the level of Real $2$-characters. We interpret results in Real
categorical character theory in terms of geometric structures, namely gerbes,
vector bundles and functions on iterated unoriented loop groupoids. This
perspective naturally leads to connections with the representation theory of
unoriented versions of the twisted Drinfeld double of $\mathsf{G}$ and with
discrete torsion in $M$-theory with orientifold. We speculate on an
interpretation of our results as a generalized Hopkins--Kuhn--Ravenel-type

and quiescent radio emission. They are suggested to form Aurorae, similar to
planets in the solar system but much more energetic. All these processes
require a source gas with an appropriate degree of ionisation which, so far, is
mostly postulated to be sufficient. We aim to demonstrate that the galactic
environment influences atmospheric ionisation, and that it hence amplifies or
enables the magnetic coupling of the atmospheres of ultra-cool objects, like
brown dwarfs and free-floating planets. We consider the effect of
photoionisation by Lyman continuum radiation in three different environments:
the InterStellar Radiation Field (ISRF), O and B stars in star forming regions,
and also for white dwarf companions in binary systems. We apply our Monte Carlo
radiation transfer code to investigate the effect of Lyman continuum
photoionisation for prescribed atmosphere structures for very low-mass objects.
The external radiation environment plays an important role for the atmospheric
ionisation of very low-mass, ultra-cool objects. Lyman continuum irradiation
greatly increases the level of ionisation in the uppermost atmospheric regions.
Our results suggest that a shell of an almost fully ionised atmospheric gas
emerges for brown dwarfs in star forming regions and brown dwarfs in white
dwarf binary systems. As a consequence, brown dwarf atmospheres can be
magnetically coupled which is the presumption for chromospheric heating to
occur and for Aurorae to emerge. First tests for assumed chromosphere-like
temperature values suggest that the resulting free-free X-ray luminosities are
comparable with those observed from non-accreting brown dwarfs in star forming
regions.

and speech recognition\cite{badrinarayanan2017segnet, dong2016image,
ren2017faster, ji20133d}. However, two critical questions remain obscure: (1)
why do deep neural networks generalize better than shallow networks; and (2)
does it always hold that a deeper network leads to better performance?
Specifically, letting $L$ be the number of convolutional and pooling layers in
a deep neural network, and $n$ be the size of the training sample, we derive an
upper bound on the expected generalization error for this network, i.e.,
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  \mathbb{E}[R(W)-R_S(W)] \leq
\exp{\left(-\frac{L}{2}\log{\frac{1}{\eta}}\right)}\sqrt{\frac{2\sigma^2}{n}I(S,W)
}
  \end{eqnarray*} where $\sigma >0$ is a constant depending on the loss
function, $0<\eta<1$ is a constant depending on the information loss for each
convolutional or pooling layer, and $I(S, W)$ is the mutual information between
the training sample $S$ and the output hypothesis $W$. This upper bound shows
that as the number of convolutional and pooling layers $L$ increases in the
network, the expected generalization error will decrease exponentially to zero.
Layers with strict information loss, such as the convolutional layers, reduce
the generalization error for the whole network; this answers the first
question. However, algorithms with zero expected generalization error does not
imply a small test error or $\mathbb{E}[R(W)]$. This is because
$\mathbb{E}[R_S(W)]$ is large when the information for fitting the data is lost
as the number of layers increases. This suggests that the claim `the deeper the
better' is conditioned on a small training error or $\mathbb{E}[R_S(W)]$.
Finally, we show that deep learning satisfies a weak notion of stability and
the sample complexity of deep neural networks will decrease as $L$ increases.

this article tests for novelty and conventionality in international research

produce more novel research. Using data from Web of Science and Scopus in 2005,
we failed to show that international collaboration tends to produce more novel

communication barriers to international collaboration may suppress novelty.
Higher citations to international work may be explained by an audience effect,
where more authors from more countries results in greater access to a larger

galaxy properties for the entire sample: we use a stellar model consisting of a
S\'ersic bulge and three double-exponential discs (a superthin disc for a young
stellar population and thin and thick discs for old populations). For the dust
component, we adopt a double-exponential disc with the new THEMIS dust-grain
model. We fit oligochromatic radiative transfer (RT) models to the optical and
near-infrared images with the fitting algorithm FitSKIRT and do panchromatic
simulations with the SKIRT code at wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet to
submillimeter. We confirm the previously stated dust energy balance problem in
galaxies: for the HEROES galaxies, the dust emission derived from our RT
calculations underestimates the real observations by a factor 1.5-4 for all
galaxies except NGC 973 and NGC 5907 (apparently, the latter galaxy has a more
complex geometry than we used). The comparison between our RT simulations and
the observations at mid-infrared-submillimeter wavelengths shows that most of
our galaxies exhibit complex dust morphologies (possible spiral arms,
star-forming regions, more extended dust structure in the radial and vertical
directions). We suggest that, in agreement with the results from Saftly et al.

region at disc centre to compare their field distributions. In order to
calibrate the projection effects, we observe an additional quiet region at the

vector distributions. This means that close to a maximum, the poles look like
typical limb, quiet-Sun regions. However, the magnetic field distributions at
the limbs are different from the distribution inferred at disc centre. At the
limbs, we infer a new population of magnetic fields with relatively strong
intensities ($\sim$600-$\sim$800 G), inclined by 30 deg with respect to the
line of sight, and with an azimuth aligned with the solar disc radial
direction. We propose that this new population at the limbs is due to the
observation of unresolved magnetic loops as seen close to the limb. These loops
have typical granular sizes as measured in the disc centre. At the limbs, where
the spatial resolution decreases, we observe them spatially unresolved, which
explains the new population of magnetic fields that is inferred. This is the
first (indirect) evidence of small-scale magnetic loops outside the disc centre
and would imply that these small-scale structures are ubiquitous on the entire
solar surface. This result has profound implications for the energetics not
only of the photosphere, but also of the outer layers since these loops have
been reported to reach the chromosphere and the low corona.

of cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations based on the EAGLE model that
self-consistently adopt an IMF that respectively becomes bottom- or top-heavy
in high-pressure environments for individual star-forming gas particles. In
such models, the excess stellar mass-to-light ($M/L$) ratio with respect to a
reference IMF is increased due to an overabundance of low-mass dwarf stars or
stellar remnants, respectively. Crucially, both pressure-dependent IMFs have
been calibrated to reproduce the observed trends of increasing excess $M/L$
with central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_e$) in early-type galaxies,
while maintaining agreement with the observables used to calibrate the EAGLE
model, namely the galaxy luminosity function, half-light radii of late-type
galaxies, and black hole masses. We find that while the $M/L$ excess is a good
measure of the IMF for low-mass slope variations, it depends strongly on the
age of the stellar population for high-mass slope variations. The normalization
of the [Mg/Fe]$-\sigma_e$ relation is decreased (increased) for bottom-
(top-)heavy IMF variations, while the slope is not strongly affected.
Bottom-heavy variations have little impact on galaxy metallicities, half-light
radii of early-type galaxies, or star formation rates, while top-heavy
variations significantly increase these quantities for high-mass galaxies,
leading to tension with observations.

formation of giant planets depends not only on stellar metallicity ([Fe/H]),
but also the mass ($M_\star$). However, measuring accurate masses for subgiants
and giants is far more challenging than it is for their main-sequence
counterparts, which has led to recent concerns regarding the veracity of the
correlation between stellar mass and planet occurrence. In order to address
these concerns we use HIRES spectra to perform a spectroscopic analysis on an
sample of 245 subgiants and derive new atmospheric and physical parameters. We
also calculate the space velocities of this sample in a homogeneous manner for
the first time. When reddening corrections are considered in the calculations
of stellar masses and a -0.12 M$_{\odot}$ offset is applied to the results, the
masses of the subgiants are consistent with their space velocity distributions,
contrary to claims in the literature. Similarly, our measurements of their
rotational velocities provide additional confirmation that the masses of
subgiants with $M_\star \geq 1.6$ M$_{\odot}$ (the ""Retired A Stars"") have not
been overestimated in previous analyses. Using these new results for our sample
of evolved stars, together with an updated sample of FGKM dwarfs, we confirm
that giant planet occurrence increases with both stellar mass and metallicity
up to 2.0 M$_{\odot}$. We show that the probability of formation of a giant
planet is approximately a one-to-one function of the total amount of metals in
the protoplanetary disk $M_\star 10^{[Fe/H]}$. This correlation provides
additional support for the core accretion mechanism of planet formation.

radii). We conclude that the former paradigm is not only tractable for
large-scale analyses, but is principled and flexible from a Bayesian
perspective whilst the latter paradigm is not. The thematic problem of Bayesian
prior definition emerges as the crux of the difference between these paradigms.
The second paradigm should in general only be considered as an ill-defined
approach to the problem of utilising archival posterior constraints on exterior
spacetime parameters; we advocate for an alternative approach whereby such
information is repurposed as an approximative likelihood function. We also
discuss why conditioning on a piecewise-polytropic equation of state model -
currently standard in the field of dense matter study - can easily violate
conditions required for transformation of a probability density distribution
between spaces of exterior (spacetime) and interior (source matter) parameters.

statistically probe the Equation of State (EOS) of cold dense matter is that
originating from the near-field vicinities of compact stars. Constraining
gravitational masses and equatorial radii of rotating compact stars is a major
goal for current and future telescope missions, with a primary purpose of
constraining the EOS. From a Bayesian perspective it is necessary to carefully
discuss prior definition; in this context a complicating issue is that in
practice there exist pathologies in the general relativistic mapping between
spaces of local (interior source matter) and global (exterior spacetime)
parameters. In a companion paper, these issues were raised on a theoretical
basis. In this study we reproduce a probability transformation procedure from
the literature in order to map a joint posterior distribution of Schwarzschild
gravitational masses and radii into a joint posterior distribution of EOS
parameters. We demonstrate computationally that EOS parameter inferences are
sensitive to the choice to define a prior on a joint space of these masses and
radii, instead of on a joint space interior source matter parameters. We focus
on the piecewise-polytropic EOS model, which is currently standard in the field
of astrophysical dense matter study. We discuss the implications of this issue

leveraging a large number of labeled (fake or real) articles. In contrast, we
focus on content-based detection of fake news articles, while assuming that we
have a small amount of labels, made available by manual fact-checkers or
automated sources. We argue this is a more realistic setting in the presence of
massive amounts of content, most of which cannot be easily factchecked. To that
end, we represent collections of news articles as multi-dimensional tensors,
leverage tensor decomposition to derive concise article embeddings that capture
spatial/contextual information about each news article, and use those
embeddings to create an article-by-article graph on which we propagate limited
labels. Results on three real-world datasets show that our method performs on
par or better than existing models that are fully supervised, in that we
achieve better detection accuracy using fewer labels. In particular, our
proposed method achieves 75.43% of accuracy using only 30% of labels of a

dynamicity in a cost-efficient manner, operators need advanced service
management capabilities such as those provided by NFV. NFV enables operators to
scale network services with higher granularity and agility than today. For this
end, automation is key. In search of this automation, the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has defined a reference NFV
framework that make use of model-driven templates called Network Service
Descriptors (NSDs) to operate network services through their lifecycle. For the
scaling operation, an NSD defines a discrete set of instantiation levels among
which a network service instance can be resized throughout its lifecycle. Thus,
the design of these levels is key for ensuring an effective scaling. In this
article, we provide an overview of the automation of the network service
scaling operation in NFV, addressing the options and boundaries introduced by
ETSI normative specifications. We start by providing a description of the NSD
structure, focusing on how instantiation levels are constructed. For
illustrative purposes, we propose an NSD for a representative NS. This NSD
includes different instantiation levels that enable different ways to
automatically scale this NS. Then, we show the different scaling procedures the
NFV framework has available, and how it may automate their triggering. Finally,
we propose an ETSI-compliant workflow to describe in detail a representative
scaling procedure. This workflow clarifies the interactions and information
exchanges between the functional blocks in the NFV framework when performing

many research on this topic. Recently, Straub and Nath-Sellers obtained
formulas for the numbers of $(n, dn-1)$ and $(n, dn+1)$-core partitions with
distinct parts, respectively. Let $X_{s,t}$ be the size of a uniform random
$(s,t)$-core partition with distinct parts when $s$ and $t$ are coprime to each
other. Some explicit formulas for the $k$-th moments $\mathbb{E} [X_{n,n+1}^k]$
and $\mathbb{E} [X_{2n+1,2n+3}^k]$ were given by Zaleski and Zeilberger when
$k$ is small. Zaleski also studied the expectation and higher moments of

  Motivated by the above works, we derive several polynomiality results and
asymptotic formulas for the $k$-th moments of $X_{n,dn+1}$ and $X_{n,dn-1}$ in

show that these $k$-th moments are asymptotically some polynomials of n with
degrees at most $2k$, when $d$ is given and $n$ tends to infinity. Moreover,
when $d=1$, we derive that the $k$-th moment $\mathbb{E} [X_{n,n+1}^k]$ of
$X_{n,n+1}$ is asymptotically equal to $\left(n^2/10\right)^k$ when $n$ tends
to infinity. The explicit formulas for the expectations $\mathbb{E}

imaging noncollinear magnetic textures on surfaces with spin-polarized scanning
tunneling microscopy (SP-STM), the high-resolution tunneling electron charge
and coupled spin transport properties of a variety of N\'eel- and Bloch-type
skyrmions are investigated. Axially symmetric skyrmions are considered within
the same topology class characterized by a vorticity value of $m=1$, and their
helicities are varied by taking $\gamma=0$ and $\pi$ values for the N\'eel
skyrmions and $\gamma=-\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$ values for the Bloch skyrmions.
Depending on the orientation of the magnetization of the STM tip as well as on
the helicity and the time-reversal of the skyrmionic spin structures, several
relationships between their spin transport vector components, the in-plane and
out-of-plane spin transfer torque and the longitudinal spin current, are
identified. The magnitudes of the spin transport vector quantities show close
relation to standard charge current SP-STM images. It is also demonstrated that
the SP-STM images can be used to determine the helicity of the skyrmions.
Moreover, the modified spin polarization vectors of the conduction electrons
due to the local chirality of the complex spin texture are incorporated into
the tunneling model. It is found that this effect modifies the apparent size of
the skyrmions. These results contribute to the proper identification of
topological surface magnetic objects imaged by SP-STM, and deliver important

molecular-dynamics simulations based on ion-ion pair potentials constructed

favorable gelation windows; the first arises from bridging effects while the
second is attributed to depletion-attractions according to phase behavior
predicted by our unified theoretical model. The NCs remain discrete within the
gel network, based on X-ray scattering and high-resolution transmission

both the NC building blocks and the network architecture, being characteristic

a unique possibility to access the electronic valley degree of freedom using
polarized light, opening the way to valley information transfer between distant
systems. Excitons with a well-defined valley index (or valley pseudospin) as
well as superpositions of the exciton valley states can be created with light
having circular and linear polarization, respectively. However, the generated
excitons have short lifetimes (ps) and are also subject to the electron-hole
exchange interaction leading to fast relaxation of the valley pseudospin and
coherence. Here we show that control of these processes can be gained by
embedding a monolayer of WSe$_2$ in an optical microcavity, where
part-light-part-matter exciton-polaritons are formed in the strong light-matter
coupling regime. We demonstrate the optical initialization of the valley
coherent polariton populations, exhibiting luminescence with a linear
polarization degree up to 3 times higher than that of the excitons. We further
control the evolution of the polariton valley coherence using a Faraday
magnetic field to rotate the valley pseudospin by an angle defined by the
exciton-cavity-mode detuning, which exceeds the rotation angle in the bare
exciton. This work provides unique insight into the decoherence mechanisms in
TMDs and demonstrates the potential for engineering the valley pseudospin

the self-interference impairs the decoding of the received message at the ET,

objective functions, including convex and continuous submodular. Stochastic
proximal gradient methods have been widely used to solve such problems;
however, their applicability remains limited when the problem dimension is
large and the projection onto a convex set is costly. Instead, stochastic
conditional gradient methods are proposed as an alternative solution relying on
(i) Approximating gradients via a simple averaging technique requiring a single
stochastic gradient evaluation per iteration; (ii) Solving a linear program to
compute the descent/ascent direction. The averaging technique reduces the noise
of gradient approximations as time progresses, and replacing projection step in
proximal methods by a linear program lowers the computational complexity of
each iteration. We show that under convexity and smoothness assumptions, our
proposed method converges to the optimal objective function value at a
sublinear rate of $O(1/t^{1/3})$. Further, for a monotone and continuous
DR-submodular function and subject to a general convex body constraint, we
prove that our proposed method achieves a $((1-1/e)OPT-\eps)$ guarantee with
$O(1/\eps^3)$ stochastic gradient computations. This guarantee matches the
known hardness results and closes the gap between deterministic and stochastic
continuous submodular maximization. Additionally, we obtain $((1/e)OPT -\eps)$
guarantee after using $O(1/\eps^3)$ stochastic gradients for the case that the
objective function is continuous DR-submodular but non-monotone and the
constraint set is down-closed. By using stochastic continuous optimization as
an interface, we provide the first $(1-1/e)$ tight approximation guarantee for
maximizing a monotone but stochastic submodular set function subject to a

one of the worst factors for vision degradation. Current rain removal methods
show limitations either for complex dynamic scenes, or under torrential rain

superpixel (SP) segmentation to decompose the scene into depth consistent

robust against rain occlusion interferences and fast camera motion. Two
alignment output tensors, i.e., optimal temporal match tensor and sorted
spatial-temporal match tensor, provide informative clues for the location of
rain streaks and the occluded background contents. Different classical and
novel methods such as Robust Principle Component Analysis and Convolutional
Neural Networks are applied and compared for their respective advantages in
efficiently exploiting the rich spatial-temporal features provided by the two
tensors. Extensive evaluations show that advantage of up to 5dB is achieved on
the scene restoration PSNR over state-of-the-art methods, and the advantage is
especially obvious with highly complex and dynamic scenes. Visual evaluations
show that the proposed framework is not only able to suppress heavy and opaque

Putting aside modeling error and parametric uncertainty, this may be achieved
by combining goal-oriented error estimates and adaptive anisotropic spatial
mesh refinements. To this end, an elegant and efficient framework is the one of
(Riemannian) metric-based adaptation where a goal-based a priori error
estimation is used as indicator for adaptivity. This work proposes a novel
extension of this approach to the case of aforementioned system approximations
bearing a stochastic component. In this case, an optimisation problem leading
to the best control of the distinct sources of errors is formulated in the
continuous framework of the Riemannian metric space. Algorithmic developments
are also presented in order to quantify and adaptively adjust the error
components in the deterministic and stochastic approximation spaces. The
capability of the proposed method is tested on various problems including a
supersonic scramjet inlet subject to geometrical and operational parametric
uncertainties. It is demonstrated to accurately capture discontinuous features

an IoT objects authentication framework is proposed. The framework uses
device-specific information, called fingerprints, along with a transfer
learning tool to authenticate objects in the IoT. The framework tracks the
effect of changes in the physical environment on fingerprints and uses unique
IoT environmental effects features to detect both cyber and cyber-physical
emulation attacks. The proposed environmental effects estimation framework is
proven to improve the detection rate of attackers without increasing the false
positives rate. The proposed framework is also shown to be able to detect
cyber-physical attackers that are capable of replicating the fingerprints of
target objects which conventional methods are unable to detect. A transfer
learning approach is proposed to allow the use of objects with different types
and features in the environmental effects estimation process to enhance the
performance of the framework while capturing practical IoT deployments with
diverse object types. Simulation results using real IoT device data show that
the proposed approach can yield a 40% improvement in cyber emulation attacks
detection and is able to detect cyber-physical emulation attacks that
conventional methods cannot detect. The results also show that the proposed
framework improves the authentication accuracy while the transfer learning
approach yields up to 70% additional performance gains.

Here we outline a system of performance metrics and reporting conditions that
resolves this issue. Our proposed system is based on volumetric energy
consumption (Wh/m$^3$) and throughput productivity (L/h/m$^2$) reported for a
specific average concentration reduction, water recovery, and feed salinity. To
facilitate and rationalize comparisons between devices, materials, and

device, showing how significantly different systems can be compared in terms of
generally desirable desalination characteristics. In general, we find that
performance analysis must be considered carefully so to not allow for ambiguous
separation conditions or the maximization of one metric at the expense of
another. Additionally, for context we discuss a number of important underlying
performance indicators and cell characteristics that are not performance
measures in and of themselves but can be examined to better understand
differences in performance.
