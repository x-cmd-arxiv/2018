thermodynamics. In this model, the medium effects are taken into account by
considering quarks and gluons as quasiparticles with temperature-dependent
masses which are proportional to the plasma frequency. The present work
involves the extension of this model in the presence of magnetic fields. We
have included the effect of the magnetic field by considering relativistic
Landau Levels. The quasiparticle masses are then found to be dependent on both
temperature and magnetic field. The thermomagnetic mass thus defined allows
obtaining the thermodynamics of magnetized quark matter within the
self-consistent quasiparticle model. The model then has been applied to the
case of 2-flavor Quark-Gluon Plasma and the equation of state obtained in the
presence of magnetic fields.

prograde spinning black holes whose progenitors are powerful FRII quasars that
transitioned rapidly from cold mode into advection dominated accretion in a few
million years. The prediction is that if sufficient fuel exists, FR0 radio

dearth of FRI radio galaxies compared to FR0s at low redshift tells us about
the supply of gas in the low redshift FR0s. Given the model prescription, this

moisture maps on the fly and automatically selects the most optimal sampling

the quality of the soil moisture model which indicates areas of the field where
the information is less precise. The sensor model follows the Poisson
distribution and we demonstrate how to integrate such measurements into the
kriging framework. We also investigate a range of different exploration
strategies and assess their usefulness through a set of evaluation experiments
based on real soil moisture data collected from two different fields. We
demonstrate the benefits of using the adaptive measurement interval and
adaptive sampling strategies for building better quality soil moisture models.
The presented method is general and can be applied to other scenarios where the
measured phenomena directly affects the acquisition time and needs to be

This paper contributes a simulation module in Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) to
evaluate the limitation of LoRaWAN in various metrics. The result shows the
performance of LoRaWAN in a simulation environment and a large scale scenario,
indicating the feature of flexible propagation range on physical layer, and
limited channel capacity on the data-link layer. The feasibility of optimized
multi-hop in LoRaWAN is analyzed. Based on the simulation result, a multi-hop

to the neuron input after finite delay $\Delta$. This impulse is identical to
those delivered from the input stream. We have obtained a general relation
allowing calculating exactly the probability density function (PDF) $p(t)$ for

2D ferromagnetism, but also revealed distinct magnetic anisotropy in the two
systems, namely Ising behavior for CrI$_3$ versus Heisenberg behavior for
CrGeTe$_3$. Such magnetic difference strongly contrasts with structural and

In this article, we develop a new controller that is capable of both rhythmic
(constant-speed) walking, transitions between speeds and/or tasks, and some
common volitional leg motions. We introduce a new piecewise holonomic phase
variable, which, through a finite state machine, forms the basis of our
controller. The phase variable is constructed by measuring the thigh angle, and
the transitions in the finite state machine are formulated through sensing foot
contact along with attributes of a nominal reference gait trajectory. The
controller was implemented on a powered knee-ankle prosthesis and tested with a
transfemoral amputee subject, who successfully performed a wide range of
rhythmic and non-rhythmic tasks, including slow and fast walking, quick start
and stop, backward walking, walking over obstacles, and kicking a soccer ball.
Use of the powered leg resulted in clinically significant reductions in amputee
compensations for rhythmic tasks (including vaulting and hip circumduction)
when compared to use of the take-home passive leg. In addition, considerable
improvements were also observed in the performance for non-rhythmic tasks. The
proposed approach is expected to provide a better understanding of rhythmic and
non-rhythmic motions in a unified framework, which in turn can lead to more
reliable control of multi-joint prostheses for a wider range of real-world
tasks.

other one is called relaxed generalized Cumulative-Sum (RGCUSUM) algorithm,
which is a modified version of the GCUSUM. It can be shown that the
computational complexity of the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm scales linearly with
the number of observations. Next, considering Lordon's setup, for any given
constraint on the expected false alarm period, a lower bound on the threshold
employed in the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm is derived, which provides a
guideline for the design of the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm to achieve the
prescribed performance requirement. In addition, for any given threshold
employed in the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm, an upper bound on the expected
detection delay is also provided. The performance of the proposed RGCUSUM
algorithm is also numerically studied in the context of an IEEE standard power
system under FDIAs.

computations in Lattice Gauge Theories. We report on the determination of the
gluon condensate from lattice QCD measurements of the basic plaquette. This is
a long standing problem, which was eventually solved a few years ago in pure
gauge. In this context NSPT is crucial: it is actually the only tool enabling
the subtraction of the power divergent contribution associated to the identity
operator in the OPE for the plaquette. This subtraction is actually a delicate
issue, since the perturbative expansion of the plaquette is on general ground
expected to be an asymptotic one, due to renormalons. This in turn results in
ambiguities and the separation of scales in the OPE does not correspond to a
separation of perturbative and non-perturbative contributions. All in all, one
needs to absorb the ambiguities attached to the perturbative series into the
definition of the condensate itself, i.e. one needs a prescription. A possible
one amounts to summing the perturbative series up to its minimal term, which
means computing up to orders which only NSPT can aim at. Our computation is the
first one in QCD, with massless staggered fermions. In order to remove the
zero-mode of the gauge field, twisted boundary conditions are adopted for the
latter, consistently coupled to fermions in the fundamental representation
supplemented with smell degrees of freedom.

appearance time of its associated supernova (SN), which was later confirmed as
SN 2018fip. A BdHN II originates in a binary composed of a carbon-oxygen core
(CO$_{\rm core}$) undergoing SN, and the SN ejecta hypercritically accrete onto
a companion neutron star (NS). From the time of the SN shock breakout to the
time when the hypercritical accretion starts, we infer the binary separation
$\simeq 3 \times 10^{10}$ cm. The accretion explains the prompt emission of
isotropic energy $\simeq 3 \times 10^{51}$ erg, lasting $\sim 10$ s, and the
accompanying observed blackbody emission from a thermal convective instability
bubble. The new neutron star ($\nu$NS) originating from the SN powers the late

GRB 180728A with GRB 130427A, a type I binary-driven hypernova (BdHN I) with

closer binary separation of $\simeq 10^{10}$ cm, implying a higher accretion

formation, and a faster, $1$ ms spinning $\nu$NS. In both cases, the optical

where a scalar degree of freedom drives the late-time acceleration. In this
study, we implement a more physical prescription, the \textit{flow} condition,
to fine-tune the quintessence evolution for several field potentials. We find
that this prescription agrees well with the most recent catalogue of data,
namely supernovae type Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic clocks and
distance to last scattering surface, and it enables us to infer the initial
conditions for the field, both potential and cosmological parameters. At
$2\sigma$ we find stricter bounds on the potential parameters $f/m_{pl}>0.26$
and $n<0.15$ for the PNGB and IPL potentials, respectively, while constraints
on cosmological parameters remain extremely consistent across all assumed
potentials. By implementing information criteria to assess their ability to fit
the data, we do not find any evidence against thawing models, which in fact are
statistically equivalent to $\Lambda$CDM, and the freezing ones are moderately
disfavoured. Through our analysis we place upper bounds on the slope of
quintessence potentials, consequently revealing a strong tension with the
recently proposed swampland criterion, finding the 2$\sigma$ upper bound of
$\lambda \sim 0.31$ for the exponential potential.

sets out to address this problem, aiming to learn a good predictive model for
the target domain using labeled examples from the source domain but only
unlabeled examples from the target domain. Domain alignment approaches this
problem by matching the source and target feature distributions, and has been
used as a key component in many state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.
However, matching the marginal feature distributions does not guarantee that
the corresponding class conditional distributions will be aligned across the
two domains. We propose co-regularized domain alignment for unsupervised domain
adaptation, which constructs multiple diverse feature spaces and aligns source
and target distributions in each of them individually, while encouraging that
alignments agree with each other with regard to the class predictions on the
unlabeled target examples. The proposed method is generic and can be used to
improve any domain adaptation method which uses domain alignment. We
instantiate it in the context of a recent state-of-the-art method and observe
that it provides significant performance improvements on several domain
adaptation benchmarks.

$2$-$4\sigma$ (equivalent to a 25%-50% measurement of the Hubble constant) if

strong atmospheric escape. We review the literature showing that
X-ray-to-optical measurements indicate that for intermediate-mass stars (IMS)
cooler than $\approx$8250 K, the X-ray and EUV (XUV) fluxes are on average
significantly higher than those of solar-like stars, while for hotter IMS,
because of the lack of surface convection, it is the opposite. We construct
spectral energy distributions for prototypical IMS, comparing them to solar.
The XUV fluxes relevant for upper planet atmospheric heating are highest for
the cooler IMS and lowest for the hotter IMS, while the UV fluxes increase with
increasing stellar temperature. We quantify the influence of this
characteristic of the stellar fluxes on the mass loss of close-in planets by
simulating the atmospheres of planets orbiting EUV-bright (WASP-33) and
EUV-faint (KELT-9) A-type stars. For KELT-9b, we find that atmospheric
expansion caused by heating due to absorption of the stellar UV and optical
light drives mass-loss rates of $\approx$10$^{11}$ g s$^{-1}$, while heating
caused by absorption of the stellar XUV radiation leads to mass-loss rates of
$\approx$10$^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$, thus underestimating mass loss. For WASP-33b,
the high XUV stellar fluxes lead to mass-loss rates of $\approx$10$^{11}$ g
s$^{-1}$. Even higher mass-loss rates are possible for less massive planets
orbiting EUV-bright IMS. We argue that it is the weak XUV stellar emission,
combined with a relatively high planetary mass, which limit planetary mass-loss
rates, to allow the prolonged existence of KELT-9-like systems.

extended reconstruction incorporating B1+ inhomogeneity and T1 recovery
information was developed to mitigate slab-boundary artifacts in short-TR
gSlider acquisitions. Slab-by-slab dynamic B0 shimming using a multi-coil
integrated {\Delta}B0/Rx shim-array, and high in-plane acceleration
(Rinplane=4) achieved with virtual-coil GRAPPA were also incorporated into a 1
mm isotropic resolution gSlider acquisition/reconstruction framework to achieve
an 8-11 fold reduction in geometric distortion compared to single-shot EPI.
Results: The slab-boundary artifacts were alleviated by the proposed B1+ and T1
corrections compared to the standard gSlider reconstruction pipeline for
short-TR acquisitions. Dynamic shimming provided >50% reduction in geometric
distortion compared to conventional global 2nd order shimming. 1 mm isotropic

transfer scheme allows separation of mixing and spreading processes, among
other advantages, but it is computationally expensive because its speed depends
on the number of interacting particle pairs. This note explores methods for
relieving the computational bottleneck caused by the mass transfer step, and we
use these algorithms to develop a new parallel, interacting particle model. The
new model is a combination of a sparse search algorithm and a novel
domain-decomposition scheme, both of which offer significant speedup relative
to the reference case--even when they are executed serially. We combine the
strengths of these methods to create a parallel particle scheme that is highly
accurate and efficient with run times that scale as $1 / P$ for a fixed number
of particles, where $P$ is the number of computational cores being used. The
new parallel model is a significant advance because it enables efficient
simulation of large particle ensembles that are needed for environmental
simulations, and also because it can naturally pair with parallel geochemical
solvers to create a practical Lagrangian tool for simulating mixing and
reactions in complex chemical systems.

broad applications in biomedicine such as assigning diagnosis codes, a number
of different computational methods (e.g. training and combining binary
classifiers for each label) have been proposed in recent years. However, many
suffered from modest accuracy and efficiency, with only limited success in
practical use. We propose ML-Net, a novel deep learning framework, for
multi-label classification of biomedical texts. As an end-to-end system, ML-Net
combines a label prediction network with an automated label count prediction
mechanism to output an optimal set of labels by leveraging both predicted
confidence score of each label and the contextual information in the target
document. We evaluate ML-Net on three independent, publicly-available corpora
in two kinds of text genres: biomedical literature and clinical notes. For
evaluation, example-based measures such as precision, recall and f-measure are
used. ML-Net is compared with several competitive machine learning baseline
models. Our benchmarking results show that ML-Net compares favorably to the
state-of-the-art methods in multi-label classification of biomedical texts.
ML-NET is also shown to be robust when evaluated on different text genres in
biomedicine. Unlike traditional machine learning methods, ML-Net does not
require human efforts in feature engineering and is highly efficient and
scalable approach to tasks with a large set of labels (no need to build
individual classifiers for each separate label). Finally, ML-NET is able to
dynamically estimate the label count based on the document context in a more
systematic and accurate manner.

production, growth, supernova-shock-driven destruction, ion-collision-driven

re-radiation of collisionally deposited electron energies. Adopting a rather
low thermal sputtering rate, we find, consistent with observations, a
present-day overall dust-to-gas ratio of $\sim 2\times 10^{-5}$, a total dust
mass of $\sim 2\times 10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$, and a dust mass fraction of $\sim
3\times 10^{-6}$. The typical thermal sputtering timescales within $\sim
100\,{\rm kpc}$ are around $\sim 10\,{\rm Myr}$, and increase towards the outer
parts of the cluster to $\sim 10^3\,{\rm Myr}$ at a cluster-centric distance of
$1\,{\rm Mpc}$. The condensation of gas phase metals into dust grains reduces
high temperature metal-line cooling, but also leads to additional dust infrared
cooling. The additional infrared cooling changes the overall cooling rate in
the outer parts of the cluster, beyond $\sim 1\,{\rm Mpc}$, by factors of a
few. This results in noticeable changes of the entropy, temperature, and
density profiles of cluster gas once dust formation is included. The emitted
dust infrared emission due to dust cooling is consistent with observational
constraints.

angular momentum of the compact remnant have closely approached their final
value, barring the possibility of later fallback. While the proto-neutron star

localized ground state and the potential strength is slowly ramped down across
the transition, then -- in analogy with the Kibble-Zurek mechanism -- it enters
the delocalized phase having finite localization length

between the ground state and the lowest of those excited states that overlap

not scale with the number of users. Since then, the general topic of coded
caching has generated enormous interest both from the information theoretic and
(network) coding theoretic viewpoint, and from the viewpoint of applications.
Building on the MAN work, this paper considers a particular network topology
referred to as cache-aided Fog Radio Access Network (Fog-RAN), that includes a
Macro-cell Base Station (MBS) co-located with the content server, several
cache-equipped Small-cell Base Stations (SBSs), and many users without caches.
Some users are served directly by the MBS broadcast downlink, while other users
are served by the SBSs. The SBSs can also exchange data via rounds of direct
communication via a side channel, referred to as ""sidelink"". For this novel
Fog-RAN model, the fundamental tradeoff among (a) the amount of cache memory at
the SBSs, (b) the load on the downlink (from MBS to directly served users and
SBSs), and (c) the aggregate load on the sidelink is studied, under the
standard worst-case demand scenario. Several existing results are recovered as
special cases of this network model and byproduct results of independent
interest are given. Finally, the role of topology-aware versus
topology-agnostic caching is discussed.

fluctuating due to turbulent convections in the late stages of their lives. The
progenitor asymmetry at the pre-supernova stage has recently caught the
attention as a new ingredient to facilitate shock revival in the delayed
neutrino-heating mechanism. In this paper, we investigate the importance of the
progenitor asymmetries to shock revival with a semi-analytical approach. Free
parameters were chosen such that the time evolution of shock radii and mass
accretion rates are compatible with the results of detailed numerical
simulations of CCSNe in spherical symmetry. We first estimate the amplitude of
asymmetries required for the shock revival by the impulsive change of pre-shock
flows in the context of neutrino heating mechanism, and then convert the
amplitude to the corresponding amplitude in the pre-supernova phase by taking
into account the growth of asymmetries during infall. We apply our model to
various types of progenitors and find that the requisite amplitude of
pre-supernova asymmetry is roughly three times larger than the prediction by
current stellar evolution models unless other additional physical ingredients
such as multi-dimensional fluid instabilities and turbulent convections in
post-shock flows aid shock revival. We thus conclude that progenitor
asymmetries can not trigger the shock revival by the impulsive way but rather
play a supplementary role in reality.

of intraday volumes for the S&P500 constituent stocks illustrates that (i)
volume surprises, i.e., deviations from their respective forecasts, are
correlated across stocks, and (ii) this correlation increases during the last
few hours of the trading session. These observations could be attributed, in
part, to the prevalence of portfolio trading activity that is implicit in the
growth of ETF, passive and systematic investment strategies; and, to the
increased trading intensity of such strategies towards the end of the trading
session, e.g., due to execution of mutual fund inflows/outflows that are
benchmarked to the closing price on each day. In this paper, we investigate the
consequences of such portfolio liquidity on price impact and portfolio
execution. We derive a linear cross-asset market impact from a stylized model
that explicitly captures the fact that a certain fraction of natural liquidity
providers only trade portfolios of stocks whenever they choose to execute. We
find that due to cross-impact and its intraday variation, it is optimal for a
risk-neutral, cost minimizing liquidator to execute a portfolio of orders in a
coupled manner, as opposed to a separable VWAP-like execution that is often
assumed. The optimal schedule couples the execution of the various orders so as
to be able to take advantage of increased portfolio liquidity towards the end
of the day. A worst case analysis shows that the potential cost reduction from
this optimized execution schedule over the separable approach can be as high as
6% for plausible model parameters. Finally, we discuss how to estimate
cross-sectional price impact if one had a dataset of realized portfolio
transaction records that exploits the low-rank structure of its coefficient
matrix suggested by our analysis.

various probability measures, as in the Wasserstein barycenter problem, or to
carry out parametric inference and density fitting, where the loss is measured
in terms of an optimal transport cost to the measure of observations. Despite
being conceptually simple, such problems are computationally challenging
because they involve minimizing over quantities (Wasserstein distances) that
are themselves hard to compute. Entropic regularization has recently emerged as
an efficient tool to approximate the solution of such variational Wasserstein
problems. In this paper, we give a thorough duality tour of these
regularization techniques. In particular, we show how important concepts from
classical OT such as c-transforms and semi-discrete approaches translate into
similar ideas in a regularized setting. These dual formulations lead to smooth
variational problems, which can be solved using smooth, differentiable and
convex optimization problems that are simpler to implement and numerically more
stable that their un-regularized counterparts. We illustrate the versatility of
this approach by applying it to the computation of Wasserstein barycenters and

cross-comparing the data from the first data release (DR1) of the LOFAR
Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 main
galaxy spectroscopic sample. The LoTSS DR1 provides deep data (median rms noise
of 71 $\mathrm{\mu}$Jy at 150 MHz) over 424 square degrees of sky, which is
sufficient to detect 10615 (32 per cent) of the SDSS galaxies over this sky
area. An improved method to separate active galactic nuclei (AGN) accurately
from sources with radio emission powered by star formation (SF) is developed
and applied, leading to a sample of 2121 local ($z < 0.3$) radio AGN. The local
150 MHz luminosity function is derived for radio AGN and SF galaxies
separately, and the good agreement with previous studies at 1.4 GHz suggests
that the separation method presented is robust. The prevalence of radio AGN
activity is confirmed to show a strong dependence on both stellar and black
hole masses, remarkably reaching a fraction of 100 per cent of the most massive
galaxies ($> 10^{11} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) displaying radio-AGN activity with
$L_{\rm 150 MHz} \geq 10^{21}$W Hz$^{-1}$; thus, the most massive galaxies are
always switched on at some level. The results allow the full Eddington-scaled
accretion rate distribution (a proxy for the duty cycle) to be probed for
massive galaxies. More than 50 per cent of the energy is released during the
$\le 2$ per cent of the time spent at the highest accretion rates,
$L_{\mathrm{mech}}/L_{\mathrm{Edd}} > 10^{-2.5}$. Stellar mass is shown to be a

in particular of voting scenarios where strategic agents are trying to reach a
joint decision. The common approach to handle uncertainty is by maximizing
expected utility, which requires a cardinal utility function as well as
detailed probabilistic information. However, often such probabilities are not
easy to estimate or apply.
  To this end, we present a framework that allows ""shades of gray"" of
likelihood without probabilities. Specifically, we create a hierarchy of sets
of world states based on a prospective poll, with inner sets contain more
likely outcomes. This hierarchy of likelihoods allows us to define what we term
ordinally-dominated strategies. We use this approach to justify various known
voting heuristics as bounded-rational strategies.

complicates drawing conclusions about the general population. When learning
causal relationships between the variables is of interest, the sample may be
assumed to be from a distribution in a causal Bayesian network (BN) model under
selection. Understanding the constraints in the model under selection is the
first step towards recovering causal structure in the original model. The
conditional-independence (CI) constraints in a BN model under selection have
been already characterised; there exist, however, additional, non-CI
constraints in such models. In this work, some initial results are provided
that simplify the characterisation problem. In addition, an algorithm is
designed for identifying compelled ancestors (definite causes) from a completed

content of high-dimensional data like text, audio, images or other signals. In
order to visualize that data in 2D or 3D, usually Dimensionality Reduction (DR)
techniques are employed. Most of these techniques, e.g., PCA or t-SNE, produce
static projections without taking into account corrections from humans or other
data exploration scenarios. In this work, we propose the interactive Similarity
Projection (iSP), a novel interactive DR framework based on similarity
embeddings, where we form a differentiable objective based on the user
interactions and perform learning using gradient descent, with an end-to-end
trainable architecture. Two interaction scenarios are evaluated. First, a
common methodology in multidimensional projection is to project a subset of
data, arrange them in classes or clusters, and project the rest unseen dataset
based on that manipulation, in a kind of semi-supervised interpolation. We
report results that outperform competitive baselines in a wide range of metrics
and datasets. Second, we explore the scenario of manipulating some classes,
while enriching the optimization with high-dimensional neighbor information.
Apart from improving classification precision and clustering on images and text
documents, the new emerging structure of the projection unveils semantic
manifolds. For example, on the Head Pose dataset, by just dragging the faces
looking far left to the left and those looking far right to the right, all
faces are re-arranged on a continuum even on the vertical axis (face up and
down). This end-to-end framework can be used for fast, visual semi-supervised
learning, manifold exploration, interactive domain adaptation of neural
embeddings and transfer learning.

matter are fully asymmetric despite an exact dark matter number symmetry
$U(1)_{\chi}$. The dark matter relic abundance arises from these asymmetries,
generated in the early universe through right-handed neutrino decays. The
$U(1)_{\chi}$ is gauged by a massless dark photon, and asymmetries with
opposite signs in the different DM flavors result in the formation of bound

in the matter power spectrum for addressing the $\sigma_8$ problem. The dark
photon as a relativistic degree of freedom contributes to $\Delta N_{eff}$,
easing the tension between the CMB and late-time $H_{0}$ measurements. Finally,
scattering between the bound states after structure formation leads to a
flattening of the dark matter distribution at the cores of haloes.

are two best-performing methods that perform equally. One method is to simply
choose the tokens with the highest tf-idf scores. Another is to train a
bidirectional language model similar to ELMo and choose the tokens with the
highest loss. If we consider any subsequence of a text to be a text in a
broader sense, we conclude that language is a strong compression code of

hierarchical method, as their latent variables are nothing but natural language
summary. We also conclude that there is a hierarchy in language such that an

number of keywords, which can be easily found by classical methods as tf-idf.
We speculate that this extraction process may be useful for unsupervised

$0.065\pm0.009$, respectively) with high statistical significance, and a
majority of sources (a fraction of $0.607 \pm 0.015$ of the sample) show

also show an overall blue asymmetry for the sample, but with smaller

spotting capability (recognition of relevant surface forms in text) is
evaluated for all three tasks, whereas the disambiguation (correctly
associating an entity from Wikipedia or DBpedia to the spotted surface forms)
is evaluated only for the first two tasks. Our evaluation is twofold: First, we
compute standard precision and recall on the output of semantic annotators on
diverse datasets, each best suited for one of the identified tasks. Second, we
build a statistical model using logistic regression to identify significant
performance differences. Our results show that systems that provide full
annotation perform better than named entities annotators and keyword

improvement for the identification of the most relevant entities described in a

to the nonlinear nature of the underlying physics and intrinsic dynamics, the
FMIs can exhibit oscillatory behaviors even under a constant applied voltage.
The motion of the surface electrons of the TI, which obeys relativistic quantum
mechanics, provides a mechanism of direct coupling between the FMIs. In
particular, the spin polarized current of the TI surface electrons can affect
the magnetization of the two FMIs, which in turn modulates the electron
transport, giving rise to a hybrid relativistic quantum/classical nonlinear
dynamical system. We find robust phase and anti-phase locking between the
magnetization dynamics. As driving the surface electrons of a TI only requires
extremely low power, our finding suggests that nano FMIs coupled by a spin

small, nonzero masses, much remains unknown about their properties and decay
modes. One potential decay mode --- neutrinoless double beta decay ($0 \nu
\beta \beta$) --- is a particularly interesting target of experimental
searches, since its observation would imply that the neutrino is a Majorana
particle, demonstrate that lepton number conservation is violated in nature,
and give further constraints on the neutrino masses and mixing angles. Relating
experimental constraints on $0 \nu \beta \beta$ decay rates to the neutrino
masses, however, requires theoretical input in the form of non-perturbative
nuclear matrix elements which remain difficult to calculate reliably. In this
talk we will discuss progress towards first-principles calculations of relevant
nuclear matrix elements using lattice QCD and effective field theory
techniques, assuming neutrinoless double beta decay mediated by a light
Majorana neutrino. We will show preliminary results for the $\pi^{-}

improved methods applicable to general lattice calculations of $0 \nu \beta

waves (TSAWs) for the induction of the self-assembly of microparticles inside a
microfluidic channel. The particles are trapped above an interdigitated
transducer, placed directly beneath the microchannel, by the TSAW-based direct
acoustic radiation force (ARF). This approach was applied to 10 {\mu}m
polystyrene particles, which were pushed towards the ceiling of the
microchannel by 72 MHz TSAWs to form single- and multiple-layer colloidal
structures. The repair of cracks and defects within the crystal lattice occurs
as part of the self-assembly process. The sample flow through the first inlet
can be switched with a buffer flow through a second inlet to control the number
of particles in the crystalline structure. The constant flow-induced Stokes
drag force on the parti-cles is balanced by the opposing TSAW-based ARF. This
force balance is essential for the acoustics-based self-assembly of
microparticles inside the microchannel. Moreover, we studied the effects of
varying the input voltage and fluid flow rate on the position and shape of the
colloidal structure. The active self-assembly of microparticles into crystals
with multiple layers can be used in the bottom-up fabrication of colloidal
structures with dimensions greater than 500 {\mu}m x 500 {\mu}m, which is
expected to have important applications in various fields.

of a single spire extending approximately vertically from near the solar
surface into the corona. Recent research supports that eruption of a miniature
filament (minifilament) drives many such single-spire jets, and concurrently
generates a miniflare at the eruption site. A different type of coronal jet,
identified in X-ray images during the Yohkoh era, are two-sided-loop jets,
which extend from a central excitation location in opposite directions, along
low-lying coronal loops more-or-less horizontal to the surface. We observe such
a two-sided-loop jet from the edge of active region (AR) 12473, using data from
Hinode XRT and EIS, and SDO AIA and HMI. Similar to single-spire jets, this
two-sided-loop jet results from eruption of a minifilament, which accelerates
to over 140 km/s before abruptly stopping after striking overlying
nearly-horizontal loop field at about 30,000 km altitude and producing the
two-sided-loop jet. Analysis of EIS raster scans show that a hot brightening,
consistent with a small flare, develops in the aftermath of the eruption, and
that Doppler motions (approx 40 km/s) occur near the jet-formation region. As
with many single-spire jets, the magnetic trigger here is apparently flux
cancelation, which occurs at a rate of approx 4x10^18 Mx/hr, comparable to the
rate observed in some single-spire AR jets. An apparent increase in the
(line-of-sight) flux occurs within minutes of onset of the minifilament
eruption, consistent with the apparent increase being due to a rapid
reconfiguration of low-lying field during and soon after minifilament-eruption
onset.

but one that can only be justified with a rigorous, quantitative framework that
relates adversarial restrictions to the protocols security and performance. We
investigate the effect of limitations on the eavesdropper's (Eve's) ability to
make a coherent attack on the security of continuous-variable quantum key
distribution (CV-QKD). We consider a realistic attack, in which the total
decoherence induced during the attack is modelled by a Gaussian channel. Based
on our decoherence model we propose an optimal hybrid attack, which allows Eve
to perform a combination of both coherent and individual attacks
simultaneously. We evaluate the asymptotic and composable finite-size security
of a heterodyne CV-QKD protocol against such hybrid attacks in terms of Eve's
decoherence. We show that when the decoherence is greater than a threshold
value, Eve's most effective strategy is reduced to the individual attack. Thus,
if we are willing to assume that the decoherence caused by the memory and the
collective measurement is large enough, it is sufficient to analyse the
security of the protocol only against individual attacks, which significantly
improves the CV-QKD performance in terms of both the key rate and the maximum
secure transmission distance.

we investigate the shift-shift and tilt-tilt spatial correlations in

calculate the translation correlations in anisotropically scattering media with
spherical or cylindrical geometries and find a simple relation between them. We
show that the Fokker-Planck model can be used with the small-angle

contribution. By considering a two-dimensional scattering system, composed of
thick dielectric cylinders coated with subwavelength layers of thermally
tunable magneto-optical semiconductors, we suggest the possibility of tailoring

enhanced by increasing the temperature of the system, and it can be decreased
by applying an external magnetic field. Altogether our findings unveil the

Consensus-based ADMM has been proved to accelerate the imaging process and
sectioning-based ADMM has shown to highly reduce the amount of information to

human-robot interaction. To accomplish this objective, Cloud Robotics (CR) was
introduced to make robots enhance their capabilities. It enables robots to
perform extensive computations in the cloud by sharing their outcomes. Outcomes
include maps, images, processing power, data, activities, and other robot
resources. But due to the colossal growth of data and traffic, CR suffers from
serious latency issues. Therefore, it is unlikely to scale a large number of
robots particularly in human-robot interaction scenarios, where responsiveness
is paramount. Furthermore, other issues related to security such as privacy
breaches and ransomware attacks can increase. To address these problems, in
this paper, we have envisioned the next generation of social robotic
architectures based on Fog Robotics (FR) that inherits the strengths of Fog
Computing to augment the future social robotic systems. These new architectures
can escalate the dexterity of robots by shoving the data closer to the robot.
Additionally, they can ensure that human-robot interaction is more responsive
by resolving the problems of CR. Moreover, experimental results are further
discussed by considering a scenario of FR and latency as a primary factor

other is a free streaming regime with zero opacity. To alleviate the
restriction on time step and capture the correct front propagation in the
diffusion limit, an implicit treatment is crucial. However, this often involves
a large-scale nonlinear iterative solver as the spatial and angular dimensions
are coupled. Our idea is to introduce an auxiliary variable that leads to a
``redundant"" system, which is then solved with a three-stage update:
prediction, correction, and projection. The benefit of this approach is that
the implicit system is local to each spatial element, independent of angular
variable, and thus only requires a scalar Newton's solver. We also introduce a
spatial discretization with a compact stencil based on even-odd decomposition.
Our method preserves both the nonlinear diffusion limit with correct front
propagation speed and the free streaming limit, with a hyperbolic CFL
condition.

precision utilizing quantum properties. Unlike the typical aim, in this paper,
we use quantum properties for adding a new functionality to quantum sensors.
More concretely, we propose a delegated quantum sensor (a client-server model)
with security inbuilt. Suppose that a client wants to measure some target
fields with high precision, but he/she does not have any high-precision sensor.
This leads the client to delegate the sensing to a remote server who possesses
a high-precision sensor. The client gives the server instructions about how to
control the sensor. The server lets the sensor interact with the target fields
in accordance with the instructions, and then sends the sensing measurement
results to the client. In this case, since the server knows the control process
and readout results of the sensor, the information of the target fields is
available not only for the client but also for the server. We show that, by
using an entanglement between the client and the server, an asymmetric
information gain is possible so that only the client can obtain the sufficient
information of the target fields. In our scheme, the server generates the
entanglement between a solid state system (that can interact with the target
fields) and a photon, and sends the photon to the client. On the other hand,
the client is required to possess linear optics elements only including wave
plates, polarizing beam splitters, and single-photon detectors. Our scheme is
feasible with the current technology, and our results pave the way for a novel
application of quantum metrology.

computations. Remarkable progress in learning in structurally defined (shallow
or deep) networks has recently been achieved. Here we introduce evolutionary
exploratory search and learning method of topologically flexible networks under
the constraint of producing elementary computational steady-state input-output
operations.
  Our results include; (1) the identification of networks, over four orders of
magnitude, implementing computation of steady-state input-output functions,
such as a band-pass filter, a threshold function, and an inverse band-pass
function. Next, (2) the learned networks are technically controllable as only a
small number of driver nodes are required to move the system to a new state.
Furthermore, we find that the fraction of required driver nodes is constant
during evolutionary learning, suggesting a stable system design. (3), our
framework allows multiplexing of different computations using the same network.
For example, using a binary representation of the inputs, the network can
readily compute three different input-output functions. Finally, (4) the
proposed evolutionary learning demonstrates transfer learning. If the system
learns one function A, then learning B requires on average less number of steps
as compared to learning B from tabula rasa.
  We conclude that the constrained evolutionary learning produces large robust
controllable circuits, capable of multiplexing and transfer learning. Our study
suggests that network-based computations of steady-state functions,
representing either cellular modules of cell-to-cell communication networks or
internal molecular circuits communicating within a cell, could be a powerful
model for biologically inspired computing. This complements conceptualizations
such as attractor based models, or reservoir computing.

to observe and record human decisions and actions in high-fidelity simulations
of ethical dilemmas that occur in the context of driving. Targeting experiments
in the class of trolley problems, TrolleyMod provides a seamless approach to
creating new experimental settings and environments with the realistic
physics-engine and the high-quality graphical capabilities of CARLA and the
Unreal Engine. Also, TrolleyMod provides a straightforward interface between
the CARLA environment and Python to enable the implementation of custom
controllers, such as deep reinforcement learning agents. The results of such
experiments can be used for sociological analyses, as well as the training and

temperature and average phonon group velocity compared to the other monolayer
boron-V compounds of boron nitride (h-BN) and boron phosphide (h-BP), yet
curiously it possesses a higher thermal conductivity. Further investigation
reveals that this is due to the phonon frequency gap caused by large mass
imbalances, which results in a restricted Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering
channel and consequently a higher thermal conductivity. We determine the
intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer h-BAs to be 362.62 W/m-K at

using a large set of randomly prepared $X$ states and analytically obtained
expressions of various measures of coherence (e.g., relative entropy of

first-order coherence), it is established that these measures of quantum
coherence cannot be used to perform ordering of a set of quantum states based
on the amount of coherence present in a state. Further, it is shown that for a

maximally nonlocal mixed states of $X$ type (which are characterized by maximal

$l1$ norm of coherence. In addition, the amount of coherence measured by $l1$

is obtained for this system. The behavior of the average photon number
corresponding to the gain and loss modes for different initial states (e.g.,
vacuum, NOON, coherent, and thermal states) has also been obtained. With the
help of the number operators, quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects are studied,
and the observed behavior is compared in PT symmetric (PTS) and PT symmetry
broken (PTSB) regimes. It has been observed that the relative phase of the
input coherent fields plays a key role in the occurrence of these effects.
Further, some nonclassicality features are witnessed using criteria based on
the number operator(s). Specifically, intermodal antibunching, sum and
difference squeezing, are investigated for specific input states. It is found
that the various nonclassical features, including the observed quantum Zeno and
anti-Zeno effects, are suppressed when one goes from PTS to PTSB regime. In
other words, the dominance of the loss/gain rate in the field modes over the
coupling strength between them diminishes the nonclassical features of the

Cho-Faddeev-Niemi decomposition has been developed in order to understand
confinement from the viewpoint of the dual superconductivity. The concept of
infrared Abelian dominance plays an important role in the realization of this
concept and through numerical simulations on the lattice, evidence was found
for example in the form of the dynamical mass generation for certain gluon
degrees of freedom. A promising analytical attempt to explain the generation of
such masses is through condensates of mass dimension two. In this talk, we want
to focus on the reformulated $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in the previously
overlooked minimal option with the non-Abelian $U(N-1)$ stability group, in
contrast to the famous maximal Abelian gauge, where the decomposition
corresponds to the Abelian $U(1)^{N-1}$ stability group. We proceed with a
thorough one-loop analysis of this novel decomposition, calculating all
standard renormalization group functions at one-loop level in light of the
renormalizability of this theory. We subsequently define an appropriate mixed
gluon-ghost composite operator of mass dimension two as the candidate for the
condensate within this theory and prove its (on-shell) BRST invariance and the
multiplicative renormalizability. Finally, the existence of the condensate is
discussed within the local composite operator formalism.

designed in inseparable processes, learning embeddings for entire networks even

inconvenience, especially on super-large or dynamic networks, where these
methods become almost impossible to implement. In this paper, we formalize the
problem of separated matrix factorization, based on which we elaborate a novel
objective function that preserves both local and global information. We further
propose SepNE, a simple and flexible network embedding algorithm which
independently learns representations for different subsets of nodes in
separated processes. By implementing separability, our algorithm reduces the
redundant efforts to embed irrelevant nodes, yielding scalability to
super-large networks, automatic implementation in distributed learning and
further adaptations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on
several real-world networks with different scales and subjects. With comparable
accuracy, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
running times on large networks.

Efficient tools that help locate the program units (files and functions) within

Another added feature allows an analysis of the tradeoffs between performance

of case studies. Results on the MFEM finite-element library include
variability/performance tradeoffs, and the identification of a (hitherto

identifying a significantly divergent floating-point result-variability and

problem for image generation tasks. Current frameworks for training a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), learn to disentangle the representations
of the data in an unsupervised fashion and capture the most significant factors
of the data variations. However, these approaches ignore the principle of
content and style disentanglement in image generation, which means their
learned latent code may alter the content and style of the generated images at
the same time. This paper describes the Style and Content Disentangled GAN
(SC-GAN), a new unsupervised algorithm for training GANs that learns
disentangled style and content representations of the data. We assume that the
representation of an image can be decomposed into a content code that
represents the geometrical information of the data, and a style code that
captures textural properties. Consequently, by fixing the style portion of the
latent representation, we can generate diverse images in a particular style.
Reversely, we can set the content code and generate a specific scene in a
variety of styles. The proposed SC-GAN has two components: a content code which
is the input to the generator, and a style code which modifies the scene style
through modification of the Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) layers'
parameters. We evaluate the proposed SC-GAN framework on a set of baseline
datasets.

specifically targeted data and/or resources through a sequence of stealthy
attacks consisting of multiple stages. Dynamic information flow tracking has
been proposed to detect APTs. In this paper, we develop a dynamic information
flow tracking game for resource-efficient detection of APTs via multi-stage
dynamic games. The game evolves on an information flow graph, whose nodes are
processes and objects (e.g. file, network endpoints) in the system and the
edges capture the interaction between different processes and objects. Each
stage of the game has pre-specified targets which are characterized by a set of
nodes of the graph and the goal of the APT is to evade detection and reach a
target node of that stage. The goal of the defender is to maximize the
detection probability while minimizing performance overhead on the system. The
resource costs of the players are different and the information structure is
asymmetric resulting in a nonzero-sum imperfect information game. We first
calculate the best responses of the players and characterize the set of Nash
equilibria for single stage attacks. Subsequently, we provide a polynomial-time
algorithm to compute a correlated equilibrium for the multi-stage attack case.
Finally, we experiment our model and algorithms on real-world nation state

outstanding performance to measure the deficit or excess in the spectra caused

channels. Such an experiment will improve the constraints of the neutrino
lifetime $\tau_3$. Compared with exclusion limits in the current accelerator
neutrino experiments T2K and NOvA under the stable $\nu$ assumption, we expect
that MOMENT gives the bound of $\tau_3/m_3\ge1.46\times10^{-11}$~s/eV at
$3\sigma$ confidence level, which is better than their recent limits:
$\tau_3/m_3\ge 7\times10^{-13}$~s/eV in NOvA and $\tau_3/m_3\ge
1.41\times10^{-12}$~s/eV in T2K. The non-decay scenario is expected to be
excluded by MOMENT at the $>3\sigma$ confidence level, if the best fit results
in T2K and NOvA are confirmed. We further find that reducing systematic
uncertainties is slightly more important than the running time. Finally, we
find very little correlations between $\tau_3/m_3$ and other oscillation

$100\,{\rm pc}$ as determined using Hipparcos parallaxes. The two populations
are compared in order to determine the unique properties that allow a small
fraction of MS stars with masses $\gtrsim1.4\,M_\odot$ to host strong, large
scale magnetic fields. A total of 52 confirmed mCP stars are identified using
published magnetic, spectroscopic, and photometric observations along with
archived and newly obtained spectropolarimetric (Stokes $V$) observations. We
derive the fundamental parameters (effective temperatures, luminosities,
masses, and evolutionary states) of the mCP and non-mCP populations using
homogeneous analyses. A detailed analysis of the mCP stars is performed using
the {\sc llmodels} code, which allows observed spectral energy distributions to
be modeled while incorporating chemical peculiarities and magnetic fields. The
surface gravities and mean chemical abundances are derived by modelling
averaged spectra using the {\sc gssp} and {\sc zeeman} spectral synthesis
codes. Masses and stellar ages are derived using modern, densely calculated
evolutionary model grids. We confirm a number of previously reported
evolutionary properties associated with mCP stars including a conspicuously
high incidence of middle-aged MS stars with respect to the non-mCP subsample;
the incidence of mCP stars is found to sharply increase with mass from
$0.3$~per~cent at $1.5\,M_\odot$ to $\approx11$~per~cent at $3.8\,M_\odot$.
Finally, we identify clear trends in the mean photospheric chemical abundances
with stellar age.

sequence (MS) stars have been previously carried out. One particularly puzzling
outcome of these surveys is the identification of a dichotomy between the
strong ($\gtrsim100\,{\rm G}$), organized fields hosted by magnetic chemically
peculiar (mCP) stars and the ultra-weak ($\lesssim1\,{\rm G}$) fields
associated with a small number of non-mCP MS stars. Despite attempts to detect
intermediate strength fields (i.e. those with strengths $\gtrsim10\,{\rm G}$
and $\lesssim100\,{\rm G}$), remarkably few examples have been found. Whether
this so-called ""magnetic desert"", separating the stars hosting ultra-weak
fields from the mCP stars truly exists has not been definitively answered. In
2007, a volume-limited spectropolarimetric survey of mCP stars using the
MuSiCoS spectropolarimeter was initiated to test the existence of the magnetic
desert by attempting to reduce the biases inherent in previous surveys. Since
then, we have obtained a large number of ESPaDOnS and NARVAL Stokes $V$

of our homogeneous analysis of the rotational periods (inferred from
photometric and magnetic variability) and magnetic properties (dipole field
strengths and obliquity angles) of the 52 confirmed mCP stars located within a
heliocentric distance of $100\,{\rm pc}$. No mCP stars exhibiting field
strengths $\lesssim300\,{\rm G}$ are found within the sample, which is
consistent with the notion that the magnetic desert is a real property and not
the result of an observational bias. Additionally, we find evidence of magnetic

not only can facilitate the design of mmWave communication systems but also can
extremely diminish power consumption. The non-linear distortion effects by
one-bit quantization at the transceiver, however, change the fundamental limits
of communication rates. In this paper, the capacity of a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) fading channel with one-bit transceiver is characterized
in a closed form when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at
both a transmitter and a receiver. One major finding is that the capacity
achieving transmission strategy is to uniformly use four multi-dimensional
constellation points. The four multi-dimensional constellation points are
optimally chosen as a function of the channel and the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) among the channel input set constructed by a spatial lattice modulation
method. As a byproduct, it is shown that a few-bit CSI feedback suffices to
achieve the capacity. For the case when CSI is not perfectly known to the
receiver, practical channel training and CSI feedback methods are presented,
which effectively exploit the derived capacity-achieving transmission strategy.

formation of amorphous ice. The calculations are aided by very long computer
simulations, often more than 50 $\mu s$ long. Density fluctuations that arise
from the proximity to a putative liquid-liquid (LL) transition at 228 K, cast a
long shadow on the properties of water, both above and below the LL transition.
We carry out the calculation of the quantum mechanical static and
frequency-dependent specific heats by combining seminal works by Lebowitz,
Percus, and Verlet and Grest and Nagel with the harmonic approximation for the
density of states. The obtained values are in quantitative agreement with all
available experimental and numerical results of specific heats for both
supercooled water and ice. We calculate the entropy at all the state points by
integrating the specific heat. We find that the quantum corrected-contributions
of intermolecular vibrational entropy dominate the excess entropy of amorphous
phases over the crystal over a wide range of temperature. Interestingly, the
vibrational entropy lowers the Kauzmann temperature, $T_{\rm K}$, to 130 K,
just below the experimental glass-to-liquid water transition temperature,
$T_{\rm g}$, of 136 K and the calculated $T_{\rm g}$ of 135 K in our previous
study. A straightforward extrapolation of high temperature entropy from 250 K
to below however would give a much higher value of $T_{\rm K}$ $\sim$ 190 K.
The calculation of Lindemann ratios places the melting of amorphous ice $\sim$
135 K. The amorphous state exhibits an extremely short correlation length for
the distance dependence of orientational correlation.

propose a data-driven outage monitoring approach based on the stochastic time
series analysis from micro phasor measurement unit ($\mu$PMU). Specifically, we
prove via power flow analysis that the dependency of time-series voltage
measurements exhibits significant statistical changes after line outages. This
makes the theory on optimal change-point detection suitable to identify line
outages via $\mu$PMUs with fast and accurate sampling. However, existing change
point detection methods require post-outage voltage distribution unknown in

select a subset of size at most $k$ to maximize a monotone submodular utility
function, is the key in many data mining and machine learning applications such
as data summarization and maximum coverage problems. When data is given as a
stream, streaming submodular optimization (SSO) techniques are desired.
Existing SSO techniques can only apply to insertion-only streams where each
element has an infinite lifespan, and sliding-window streams where each element
has a same lifespan (i.e., window size). However, elements in some data streams
may have arbitrary different lifespans, and this requires addressing SSO over
streams with inhomogeneous-decays (SSO-ID). This work formulates the SSO-ID
problem and presents three algorithms: BasicStreaming is a basic streaming
algorithm that achieves an $(1/2-\epsilon)$ approximation factor; HistApprox
improves the efficiency significantly and achieves an $(1/3-\epsilon)$
approximation factor; HistStreaming is a streaming version of HistApprox and
uses heuristics to further improve the efficiency. Experiments conducted on
real data demonstrate that HistStreaming can find high quality solutions and is
up to two orders of magnitude faster than the naive Greedy algorithm.

performing extensive molecular dynamics simulations on this supercooled region,
we find that structural and dynamical instabilities are hidden in the
experimentally inaccessible region between 235 K and 150 K. We find a hitherto
undiscovered fragmentation from 220 K to 190 K, which is the break-up of large
clusters consisting of molecules with locally distorted tetrahedral structure
into small pieces with one or two isolated defects. The fragmentation leads to
considerable changes in the relaxation dynamics of water. We reveal a crucial
role of specific three-coordinated defects in slow but persistent structural
relaxation. The presence of relaxation due to these specific defects makes
water glass transition temperature $T_{\rm g}$ (= 136 K) extremely low and
explains why the $T_{\rm g}$ of water is $\sim$ 1/2 of the melting temperature
Tm, much lower than the commonly obeyed 2/3 rule of $T_{\rm g}/T_{\rm m}$.

The limited availability of materials data can be addressed through transfer
learning, while the generic representation was recently addressed by Xie and
Grossman [1], where they developed a crystal graph convolutional neural network
(CGCNN) that provides a unified representation of crystals. In this work, we
develop a new model (MT-CGCNN) by integrating CGCNN with transfer learning

by simultaneous prediction of various material properties such as Formation
Energy, Band Gap and Fermi Energy for a wide range of inorganic crystals (46774
materials). MT-CGCNN is able to reduce the test error when employed on
correlated properties by upto 8%. The model prediction has lower test error
compared to CGCNN, even when the training data is reduced by 10%. We also
demonstrate our model's better performance through prediction of end user
scenario related to metal/non-metal classification. These results encourage
further development of machine learning approaches which leverage multi-task
learning to address the aforementioned challenges in the discovery of new
materials. We make MT-CGCNN's source code available to encourage reproducible

telecommunications, signal processing, data storage, spectroscopy, sensing, and
imaging. As an independent research area, nonlinear optics began with the
invention of the laser, because practical sources of intense light needed to
generate optical nonlinearities were not previously available. However the high
power requirements of many nonlinear optical systems limit their use,
especially in portable or medical applications, and so there is a push to
develop new materials and resonant structures capable of producing nonlinear
optical phenomena with low-power light emitted by inexpensive and compact
sources. Acoustic nonlinearities, especially giant acoustic nonlinear phenomena
in gas bubbles and liquid droplets, are much stronger than their optical
counterparts. Here, we suggest employing acoustic nonlinearities to generate
new optical frequencies, thereby effectively reproducing nonlinear optical
processes without the need for laser light. We critically survey the current
literature dedicated to the interaction of light with nonlinear acoustic waves
and highly-nonlinear oscillations of gas bubbles and liquid droplets. We show
that the conversion of acoustic nonlinearities into optical signals is possible
with low-cost incoherent light sources such as light-emitting diodes, which
would usher new classes of low-power photonic devices that are more affordable
for remote communities and developing nations, or where there are demanding
requirements on size, weight and power.

times and improved noise performance. ESPIRiT is one such technique that
estimates coil sensitivity maps from the auto-calibration region using an
eigenvalue-based method. This method requires choosing several parameters for
the the map estimation. Even though ESPIRiT is fairly robust to these parameter
choices, occasionally, poor selection can result in reduced performance. The
purpose of this work is to automatically select parameters in ESPIRiT for more
robust and consistent performance across a variety of exams.
  Theory and Methods: Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) is a method of
calculating an unbiased estimate of the mean squared error of an estimator
under certain assumptions. We show that this can be used to estimate the
performance of ESPIRiT. We derive and demonstrate the use of SURE to optimize
ESPIRiT parameter selection.
  Results: Simulations show SURE to be an accurate estimator of the mean
squared error. SURE is then used to optimize ESPIRiT parameters to yield maps
that are optimal in a denoising/data-consistency sense. This improves g-factor
performance without causing undesirable attenuation. In-vivo experiments verify
the reliability of this method.
  Conclusion: Simulation experiments demonstrate that SURE is an accurate
estimate of expected mean squared error. Using SURE to determine ESPIRiT
parameters allows for automatic parameter selections.In-vivo results are
consistent with simulation and theoretical results.

truncation error of quadrature applied to inversion in a high-density region.
Owing to these properties, the proposed method is computationally stable and

a normal variance-mean mixture, and in an application of maximum likelihood

significant importance in information theory and signal processing, e.g.,
channel estimation in energy efficient massive MIMO systems and direction of

well as its corresponding parameters including the model order, frequencies and
amplitudes from heavily quantized samples. To this end, we propose an efficient
grid-less Bayesian algorithm named VALSE-EP, which is a combination of the
variational line spectral estimation (VALSE) and expectation propagation (EP).
The basic idea of VALSE-EP is to iteratively approximate the challenging
quantized model of line spectral estimation as a sequence of simple pseudo
unquantized models so that the VALSE can be applied. Note that the noise in the
pseudo linear model is heteroscedastic, i.e., different components having
different variances, and a variant of the VALSE is re-derived to obtain the
final VALSE-EP. Moreover, to obtain a benchmark performance of the proposed
algorithm, the Cram\'{e}r Rao bound (CRB) is derived. Finally, numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real data are performed, demonstrating the
near CRB performance of the proposed VALSE-EP for line spectral estimation from

The measured waveform and spectrum of the transmitted electromagnetic wave,

mixing can occur on the metasurface. The parameter dependence of the conversion
efficiency of the frequency mixing phenomenon shows that the efficiency is
determined almost entirely by the ratio of the duration of microplasma
generation to the modulation period of the incident wave amplitude. This result
implies that the frequency mixing is derived from a binary change in the

contribution to double-twist data from the Virasoro vacuum module defines a
""Virasoro Mean Field Theory"" (VMFT), its spectrum includes a finite number of
discrete Regge trajectories, whose dimensions obey a simple formula exact in

provides a baseline for large spin universality in two dimensions: in every
unitary compact CFT$_2$ with $c > 1$ and a twist gap above the vacuum, the
double-twist data approaches that of VMFT at large spin $\ell$. Corrections to
the large spin spectrum from individual non-vacuum primaries are exponentially
small in $\sqrt{\ell}$ for fixed $c$. We analyze our results in various large

require accurate covariance matrices. A covariance matrix of the 2-point
function comprises the disconnected part and the connected part. While the
connected covariance only becomes important on small scales, the disconnected
covariance is dominant on large scales, where the survey window has a
significant impact. In this work, we develop an analytical method to compute
the disconnected covariance, accounting for the window effect. Derived under
the flat-sky approximation, our formalism is applicable to wide surveys by
swapping in the curved-sky window functions. Our method works for both the
power spectrum and the correlation function, and applies to the covariances of
various probes including the multipoles and the wedges of 3D clustering, the
angular and the projected statistics of clustering and shear, as well as the
cross covariances between different probes. We verify the analytic covariance
against the sample covariance from the galaxy mock simulations in two test
cases: (1) the power spectrum multipole covariance, and (2) the joint
covariance of the projected correlation function and the correlation function
multipoles. Our method achieve good agreement with the mocks, while at a
negligible computational cost. Unlike mocks, our analytic covariance is free of
sampling noise, which often leads to numerical problems and the need to inflate
the errors. In addition, our method can use the best-fit power spectrum as
input, in contrast to the standard procedure of using a fiducial model that may
deviate significantly from the truth. We also show that a naive diagonal power
spectrum covariance underestimates the signal-to-noise ratio compared to our
analytic covariance. The code that accompanies this paper is available at

al., 2013b) use syntactic preposition patterns to calculate word relatedness.
However, such patterns only consider NPs' head nouns and hence do not fully
capture the semantics of NPs. Recently, Hou (2018) created word embeddings
(embeddings_PP) to capture associative similarity (ie, relatedness) between
nouns by exploring the syntactic structure of noun phrases. But embeddings_PP
only contains word representations for nouns. In this paper, we create new word
vectors by combining embeddings_PP with GloVe. This new word embeddings
(embeddings_bridging) are a more general lexical knowledge resource for
bridging and allow us to represent the meaning of an NP beyond its head easily.
We therefore develop a deterministic approach for bridging anaphora resolution,
which represents the semantics of an NP based on its head noun and
modifications. We show that this simple approach achieves the competitive
results compared to the best system in Hou et al.(2013b) which explores Markov
Logic Networks to model the problem. Additionally, we further improve the
results for bridging anaphora resolution reported in Hou (2018) by combining

primary may be inhibited by the X-ray irradiation. This creates the feedback
that limits the X-ray luminosity of the compact secondary. Wind inhibition
might be weakened by the effect of small-scale wind inhomogeneities (clumping)
possibly affecting the limiting X-ray luminosity. We study the influence of
X-ray irradiation on the stellar wind for different radial distributions of
clumping. We calculate hot star wind models with external irradiation and
clumping using our global wind code. The models are calculated for different
parameters of the binary. We determine the parameters for which the X-ray wind
ionization leads to a decrease of the radiative force. This causes a decrease
of the wind velocity and even of the mass-loss rate in the case of extreme
X-ray irradiation. Clumping weakens the effect of X-ray irradiation because it
favours recombination and leads to an increase of the wind mass-loss rate. The
best match between the models and observed properties of high-mass X-ray
binaries (HMXB) is derived with radially variable clumping. We describe the
influence of X-ray irradiation on the terminal velocity and on the mass-loss
rate in a parametric way. The X-ray luminosities predicted within the Bondi
theory agree nicely with observations when accounting for X-ray irradiation.
The ionizing feedback regulates the accretion onto the compact companion
resulting in a relatively stable X-ray source. The wind-powered accretion model
can account for large luminosities in HMXBs only when introducing the ionizing
feedback. There are two possible states following from the dependence of X-ray
luminosity on the wind terminal velocity and mass-loss rate. One state has low
X-ray luminosity and a nearly undisturbed wind, and the second state has high
X-ray luminosity and exhibits a strong influence of X-rays on the flow.

channel being used. The transform can be used to design a universal code for
this scenario. The code is to have vanishing error probability when used over
any channel in the set, and achieve the infimal information rate over the set.
The setting considered is, in fact, more general: we consider a set of
processes with memory. Universal polarization is established for the case where
each process in the set: (a) has memory in the form of an underlying hidden
Markov state sequence that is aperiodic and irreducible, and (b) satisfies a
`forgetfulness' property. Forgetfulness, which we believe to be of independent
interest, occurs when two hidden Markov states become approximately independent
of each other given a sufficiently long sequence of observations between them.
We show that aperiodicity and irreducibility of the underlying Markov chain is
not sufficient for forgetfulness, and develop a sufficient condition for a
hidden Markov process to be forgetful.

  The random choice of the Hessian subsample is also considered and convergence
in the mean square, both for finite and infinite sums of functions, is proved.
Finally, global convergence with asymptotic R-linear rate of IN methods is
extended to the case of sum of convex function and strongly convex objective

nature, thus, stirring disagreement between the different involved parties of a
discussion. This is due to the fact that for language and its use,
specifically, the understanding and use of phrases, the stances are cohesive
within the particular groups. However, such cohesiveness does not hold across
groups.
  In collaborative environments or environments where impartial language is
desired (e.g. Wikipedia, news media), statements and the language therein
should represent equally the involved parties and be neutrally phrased. Biased
language is introduced through the presence of inflammatory words or phrases,
or statements that may be incorrect or one-sided, thus violating such

  In this work, we focus on the specific case of phrasing bias, which may be
introduced through specific inflammatory words or phrases in a statement. For
this purpose, we propose an approach that relies on a recurrent neural networks
in order to capture the inter-dependencies between words in a phrase that
introduced bias.
  We perform a thorough experimental evaluation, where we show the advantages
of a neural based approach over competitors that rely on word lexicons and
other hand-crafted features in detecting biased language. We are able to
distinguish biased statements with a precision of P=0.92, thus significantly
outperforming baseline models with an improvement of over 30%. Finally, we
release the largest corpus of statements annotated for biased language.

derivative (aka.~sensitivity) of expectations of functions involving an

  The method is an improvement of the approach presented in [Risk Magazine
April 2018].
  The finite difference approximation of a partial derivative of a Monte-Carlo
integral of a discontinuous function is known to exhibit a high Monte-Carlo
error. The issue is evident since the Monte-Carlo approximation of a
discontinuous function is just a finite sum of discontinuous functions and as
such, not even differentiable.
  The algorithmic differentiation of a discontinuous function is problematic. A
natural approach is to replace the discontinuity by continuous functions. This
is equivalent to replacing a path-wise automatic differentiation by a (local)
finite difference approximation.
  We present an improvement (in terms of variance reduction) by decoupling the
integration of the Dirac delta and the remaining conditional expectation and
estimating the two parts by separate regressions. For the algorithmic
differentiation, we derive an operator that can be injected seamlessly - with
minimal code changes - into the algorithm resulting in the exact result.

topic in the field of urban transportation. Current research mainly uses
several statistical indicators of complex networks to analyze the road network
systems. However, these methods are essentially node-based. These node-based
methods are more concerned with the number of connections between nodes, and
lack of consideration for interactions. So, this leads to the well-known node
paradox problem, and their ability of characterizing the local and intrinsic
properties of a network is weak. From the perspective of network intrinsic
geometry, this paper proposes a method for measuring road network vulnerability
using a discrete Ricci curvature, which can identify the key sections of a road
network and indicate its fragile elements. The results show that our method
performs better than complex network statistics on measuring the vulnerability
of a road network. Additionally, it can characterize the evolution of the road
network vulnerability among different periods of time in the same city through
our method. Finally, we compare our method with the previous method of
centrality and show the different between them. This article provides a new
perspective on a geometry to analyze the vulnerability of a road network and
describes the inherent nature of the vulnerability of a road system from a new
perspective. It also contributes to enriching the analytical methods of complex
road networks.

the contrast-magnetic field dependence in active region plage observed near
disk center with Sunrise during its second flight in 2013. The wavelengths
under study range from the visible at 525\,nm to the near ultraviolet (NUV) at
300\,nm and 397\,nm. We use quasi-simultaneous spectropolarimetric and
photometric data from the Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment (IMaX) and the
Sunrise Filter Imager (SuFI), respectively. We find that in all wavelength
bands, the contrast exhibits a qualitatively similar dependence on the
line-of-sight magnetic field, $B_{\rm LOS}$, as found in the quiet Sun, with
the exception of the continuum at 525\,nm. There, the contrast of plage
magnetic elements peaks for intermediate values of $B_{\rm LOS}$ and decreases
at higher field strengths. By comparison, the contrast of magnetic elements in
the quiet Sun saturates at its maximum value at large $B_{\rm LOS}$. We find
that the explanation of the turnover in contrast in terms of the effect of
finite spatial resolution of the data is incorrect with the evidence provided
by the high-spatial resolution Sunrise data, as the plage magnetic elements are
larger than the quiet Sun magnetic elements and are well-resolved. The turnover
comes from the fact that the core pixels of these larger magnetic elements are
darker than the quiet Sun. We find that plages reach lower contrast than the
quiet Sun at disk center at wavelength bands formed deep in the photosphere,
such as the visible continuum and the 300\,nm band. This difference decreases
with formation height and disappears in the Ca\,{\sc ii} H core, in agreement

$\{e_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ form an orthonormal basis of a complex Hilbert space, by
a sequence of i.i.d. random variables $\{X_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$; that is,
$w_n=X_n$. This paper answers basic questions concerning such a model. We
propose that this model can be studied in comparison with the classical
Hardy/Bergman/Dirichlet spaces in function-theoretic operator theory.
  We calculate the spectra and determine their fine structures (Section 3). We
classify the samples up to four equivalence relationships (Section 4). We
introduce a family of random Hardy spaces and determine the growth rate of the
coefficients of analytic functions in these spaces (Section 5). We compare them
with three types of classical operators (Section 6); this is achieved in the
form of generalized von Neumann inequalities. The invariant subspaces are shown
to admit arbitrarily large indices and their semi-invariant subspaces model
arbitrary contractions almost surely. We discuss a Beurling-type theorem
(Section 7). We determine various non-selfadjoint algebras generated by $T$
(Section 8). Their dynamical properties are clarified (Section 9). Their
iterated Aluthge transforms are shown to converge (Section 10).
  In summary, they provide a new random model from the viewpoint of probability
theory, and they provide a new class of analytic functional Hilbert spaces from
the viewpoint of operator theory. The technical novelty in this paper is that
the methodology used draws from three (largely separate) sources: probability
theory, functional Hilbert spaces, and the approximation theory of bounded

law. In this work, we investigate the relevance of this scaling relation by
computing models of fast-rotating stars and their oscillation spectra. In order

Arguing that the observed large separation is systematically smaller than the

address this bottleneck by computing inside the memory units and thereby
eliminating the energy-intensive and time-consuming data movement. However,
most LIM approaches reported in literature are not truly ""simultaneous"" as
during LIM operation the bitcell can be used only as a Memory cell or only as a
Logic cell. The bitcell is not capable of storing both the Memory/Logic outputs

demonstrate the SLIM methodology using non-filamentary bilayer analog OxRAM
devices with NMOS transistors (2T-1R bitcell). Detailed programming scheme,
array level implementation and controller architecture are also proposed.
Furthermore, to study the impact of introducing SLIM array in the memory
hierarchy, a simple image processing application (edge detection) is also
investigated. It has been estimated that by performing all computations inside

to search for the evidence for additional SN II yields, which is expected as a
direct result of the possible merger-induced starburst. We reveal that, similar
to the Fe abundance, the Mg abundance also shows a high value in both the
innermost region and the southwest substructure, forming a high-abundance
plateau, meanwhile all the SN Ia and SN II yields show rather flat
distributions in $>0.1r_{200}$ in favor of an early enrichment. Then we carry
out a series of idealized numerical simulations to model the collision of two
initially isolated galaxy groups by using the TreePM-SPH GADGET-3 code. We find
that the observed X-ray emission and metal distributions, as well as the
relative positions of the two bright central galaxies with reference to the
X-ray peak, can be well reproduced in a major merger with a mass ratio of 3
when the merger-induced starburst is assumed. The `best-match' snapshot is
pinpointed after the third pericentric passage when the southwest substructure
is formed due to gas sloshing. By following the evolution of the simulated

enrichment are mostly restricted within the core region when the final relaxed

presence of extra $U(1)$ symmetries. The extra neutral currents associated to
these models have been investigated in the past in orientifold models with
intersecting branes, under the assumption that the St\""uckelberg scale was in
the multi-TeV region. Such constructions, at the field theory level, are quite
general and can be interpreted as the four-dimensional field theory realization
of the Green-Schwarz mechanism of anomaly cancellation of string theory. We
present an overview of models of this type in the TeV/multi TeV range in their
original formulation and their recent embeddings into an ordinary GUT theory,
presenting an $E_6\times U(1)_X$ model as an example. In this case the model
contains two axions, the first corresponding to a Peccei-Quinn axion, whose
misalignment takes place at the QCD phase transition, with a mass in the meV
region and which solves the strong CP problem. The second axion is ultralight,
in the $10^{-20}-10^{-22}$ eV region, due to a misalignment and a decoupling
taking place at the GUT scale. The two scales introduced by the PQ solution,
the PQ breaking scale and the misalignment scale at the QCD hadron transition,
become the Planck and the GUT scales respectively, with a global anomaly
replaced by a gauge anomaly. The periodic potential and the corresponding
oscillations are related to a particle whose De Broglie wavelength can reach 10

tight up to a factor of $2^{o(s)},$ when $G=\mathbb{Z}$ and $K=o(s/(\log

""R23"", defined as ([OII]$\lambda$$\lambda$3726, 3729 +
[OIII]$\lambda$$\lambda$4959,5007)/H$\beta$. Most calibrations for these
strong-line metallicity indicators are for continuum selected galaxies. We
report a new empirical calibration of R23 for extreme emission-line galaxies
using a large sample of about 800 star-forming green pea galaxies with reliable
T$_e$-based gas-phase metallicity measurements. This sample is assembled from
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 13 with the equivalent width of
the line [OIII]$\lambda$5007 $>$ 300 \AA\ or the equivalent width of the line
H$\beta$ $>$ 100 \AA\ in the redshift range 0.011 $<$ z $<$ 0.411. For galaxies
with strong emission lines and large ionization parameter (which manifests as
log [OIII]$\lambda$$\lambda$4959,5007/[OII]$\lambda$$\lambda$3726,3729 $\geq$
0.6), R23 monotonically increases with log(O/H) and the double-value degeneracy
is broken. Our calibration provides metallicity estimates that are accurate to
within $\sim$ 0.14 dex in this regime. Many previous R23 calibrations are found
to have bias and large scatter for extreme emission-line galaxies. We give
formulae and plots to directly convert R23 and
[OIII]$\lambda$$\lambda$4959,5007/[OII]$\lambda$$\lambda$3726,3729 to log(O/H).
Since green peas are best nearby analogs of high-redshift Lyman-$\alpha$
emitting galaxies, the new calibration offers a good way to estimate the
metallicities of both extreme emission-line galaxies and high-redshift
Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies. We also report on 15 galaxies with
metallicities less than 1/12 solar, with the lowest metallicities being
12+log(O/H) = 7.25 and 7.26.

masses moving on a circle subject to attractive cosine inter-particle
potentials. It is a simpler variant of the gravitational three-body problem and
also arises as the classical limit of a model of coupled Josephson junctions.
Unlike in the gravitational problem, there are no singularities (neither
collisional nor non-collisional), leading to global existence and uniqueness of
solutions. In appropriate units, the non-negative energy $E$ of the relative
motion is the only free parameter. We find analogues of the Euler-Lagrange
family of periodic solutions: pendulum and isosceles solutions at all energies
and choreographies up to moderate energies. The model displays
order-chaos-order behavior: it is integrable at zero and infinitely high
energies but displays a fairly sharp transition from regular to chaotic
behavior as $E$ is increased beyond $E_c \approx 4$ and a more gradual return
to regularity. The transition to chaos is manifested in a dramatic rise of the
fraction of the area of the Hill region of Poincar\'e surfaces occupied by
chaotic sections and also in the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries of
Poincar\'e sections present at lower energies. Interestingly, the above
pendulum solutions alternate between being stable and unstable, with the
transition energies cascading geometrically from either side at $E = 4$. The
transition to chaos is also reflected in the curvature of the Jacobi-Maupertuis
metric that ceases to be everywhere positive when $E$ exceeds four. Examination
of Poincar\'e sections also indicates global chaos in a band of energies $(5.33
\lesssim E \lesssim 5.6)$ slightly above this transition.

consider a random graph drawn according to the stochastic block model~: its
vertex set is partitioned into blocks, or communities, and edges are placed
randomly and independently of each other with probability depending only on the
communities of their two endpoints. In this context, our aim is to recover the
community labels better than by random guess, based only on the observation of
the graph.
  In the sparse case, where edge probabilities are in $O(1/n)$, we introduce a
new spectral method based on the distance matrix $D^{(l)}$, where $D^{(l)}_{ij}
= 1$ iff the graph distance between $i$ and $j$, noted $d(i, j)$ is equal to
$\ell$. We show that when $\ell \sim c\log(n)$ for carefully chosen $c$, the
eigenvectors associated to the largest eigenvalues of $D^{(l)}$ provide enough
information to perform non-trivial community recovery with high probability,
provided we are above the so-called Kesten-Stigum threshold. This yields an
efficient algorithm for community detection, since computation of the matrix
$D^{(l)}$ can be done in $O(n^{1+\kappa})$ operations for a small constant
$\kappa$.
  We then study the sensitivity of the eigendecomposition of $D^{(l)}$ when we
allow an adversarial perturbation of the edges of $G$. We show that when the
considered perturbation does not affect more than $O(n^\varepsilon)$ vertices
for some small $\varepsilon > 0$, the highest eigenvalues and their
corresponding eigenvectors incur negligible perturbations, which allows us to
still perform efficient recovery.

The mean projected range ($R_p$) of 350 keV C ions in MgB$_2$ is 560 nm, thus
the energetic C ions will pass through the MB400nm, whereas the ions will
remain into the MB800nm. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$),
upper critical field ($H_{c2}$), $c$-axis lattice parameter, and corrected
residual resistivity ($\rho_{corr}$) of both the films showed similar trends
with the variation of fluence. However, a disparate behavior in the
superconducting phase transition was observed in the MB800nm when the fluence
was larger than 1 x 10$^{14}$ C atoms/cm$^2$ because of the different Tcs
between the irradiated and non-irradiated parts of the film. Interestingly, the
superconducting critical properties, such as $T_c$, $H_{c2}$, and $J_c$, of the
irradiated MgB$_2$ films, as well as the lattice parameter, were almost
restored to those in the pristine state after a thermal annealing procedure.
These results demonstrate that the atomic lattice distortion induced by C-ion

interrelate with human activities at their core. While social sciences provide
angles to study such activities, e.g., within the framework of
cultural-historical activity theory, there is no formal approach to give an
account of complex human activities from a Knowledge Representation and
Reasoning (KR) perspective. Our goal is to develop a logic-based framework to
specify complex activities that is directly informed by activity theory. There,
complex activity refers to the process that mediates the relation between a
subject and some motivating object which in turn generates a hierarchy of goals
that direct actions. We introduce a new temporal logic to formalise key
concepts from activity theory and study various inference problems in our
framework. We furthermore discuss how to use Answer-Set Programming as a KR
shell for activity reasoning that allows to solve various reasoning tasks in a
uniform way.

by this, in this study we introduce ProstateGAN, a GAN-based model for

found to be vulnerable to image quality degradation. Even a small amount of
distortion such as noise or blur can severely hamper the performance of these
CNN architectures. Most of the work in the literature strives to mitigate this
problem simply by fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN on mutually exclusive or a
union set of distorted training data. This iterative fine-tuning process with
all known types of distortion is exhaustive and the network struggles to handle
unseen distortions. In this work, we propose distortion robust DCT-Net, a
Discrete Cosine Transform based module integrated into a deep network which is
built on top of VGG16. Unlike other works in the literature, DCT-Net is ""blind""
to the distortion type and level in an image both during training and testing.
As a part of the training process, the proposed DCT module discards input
information which mostly represents the contribution of high frequencies. The
DCT-Net is trained ""blindly"" only once and applied in generic situation without
further retraining. We also extend the idea of traditional dropout and present
a training adaptive version of the same. We evaluate our proposed method
against Gaussian blur, motion blur, salt and pepper noise, Gaussian noise and
speckle noise added to CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet test sets. Experimental
results demonstrate that once trained, DCT-Net not only generalizes well to a
variety of unseen image distortions but also outperforms other methods in the
literature.

this balance in the context of dual-resolution ensembles, which use members

investigates whether statistical post-processing of such dual-resolution

be less pronounced than for raw forecasts. Moreover, the ranking of the

the dust. We also constrain the presence and strength of nuclear dust heated by
active galactic nuclei. The radiation field of LIRGs tends to have much higher
intensity than in quiescent galaxies, and it increases toward advanced merger
stages as a result of central concentration of the interstellar medium and star
formation. The total gas mass is derived from the dust mass and the galaxy
stellar mass. We find that the gas fraction of LIRGs is on average ~ 0.3 dex
higher than that of main-sequence star-forming galaxies, rising moderately
toward advanced merger stages. All LIRGs have star formation rates that place
them above the galaxy star formation main sequence. Consistent with recent

  A full account of quantum effects is achieved in the anti-adiabatic limit
where the effective low-energy theory represents a massive version the N=4
Gross-Neveu model. Using Abelian bosonization we demonstrate that the
description of the SD phase, including its critical boundaries, is well
approximated by a sum of two effective double-frequency sine-Gordon (DSG)
models subject to self-consistency conditions that couple the charge and spin
sectors. Using the well-known critical properties of the DSG model we obtain
the singular parts of the dimerization order parameter and staggered charge and
spin susceptibilities near the Ising critical lines. We show that, in the
anti-adiabatic limit, on the line $m_{\downarrow} = 0$ there exists of a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical point separating a Luttinger-liquid
gapless phase from the spontaneously dimerized one. We also discuss topological
excitations of the model carrying fractional charge and spin.

omitted in the literature. The theory is combined with first-principle

their strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy. In this paper, we demonstrate that
the hexagonal ErMnO3 single crystals also unveils a giant rotating
magnetocaloric effect that can be obtained by spinning them in constant
magnetic fields around their a or b axes. When the ErMnO3 crystal is rotated
with the magnetic field initially parallel to the c-axis, the resulting entropy
change reaches maximum values of 7, 17 and 20 J/kg K under a constant magnetic
field of 2, 5 and 7 T, respectively. These values are comparable or even larger
than those shown by some of the best orthorhombic phases. More interestingly,
the generated anisotropic thermal effect is about three times larger than that
exhibited by the hexagonal HoMnO3 single crystal. The enhancement of the
rotating magnetocaloric effect in the hexagonal ErMnO3 compound arises from the
unique features of Er3+ magnetic sublattice. In fact, the Er3+ magnetic moments
located at 2a sites experience a first-order metamagnetic transition close to 3
K along the c-axis resulting in a peaked magnetocaloric effect over a narrower
temperature range. In contrast, the (paramagnetic) behaviour of Er3+ magnetic
moments within the ab-plane, produces a larger magnetocaloric effect over a
wider temperature range. Therefore, the magnetocaloric effect anisotropy is
maximized between the c and the ab-directions, leading to a giant rotating
magnetocaloric effect.

undertaking in evolutionary analysis. In the last few years, therefore,
tree-based phylogenetic networks, which are defined by a spanning tree called a
subdivision tree, have attracted attention of theoretical biologists. However,
the application of such networks is still not easy, due to many problems whose
time complexities are not clearly understood. In this paper, we provide a
general framework for solving those various old or new problems from a coherent
perspective, rather than analyzing the complexity of each individual problem or
developing an algorithm one by one. More precisely, we establish a structure
theorem that gives a way to canonically decompose any rooted binary
phylogenetic network N into maximal zig-zag trails that are uniquely
determined, and use it to characterize the set of subdivision trees of N in the
form of a direct product, in a way reminiscent of the structure theorem for
finitely generated Abelian groups. From the main results, we derive a series of
linear time and linear time delay algorithms for the following problems: given
a rooted binary phylogenetic network N, 1) determine whether or not N has a
subdivision tree and find one if there exists any; 2) measure the deviation of
N from being tree-based; 3) compute the number of subdivision trees of N; 4)
list all subdivision trees of N; and 5) find a subdivision tree to maximize or
minimize a prescribed objective function. All algorithms proposed here are
optimal in terms of time complexity. Our results do not only imply and unify
various known results, but also answer many open questions and moreover enable
novel applications, such as the estimation of a maximum likelihood tree
underlying a tree-based network. The results and algorithms in this paper still
hold true for a special class of rooted non-binary phylogenetic networks.

CIFAR-100, SVHN, EMNIST, and ImageNet show that Drop-Activation generally
improves the performance of popular neural network architectures for the image

virtually infinite range energy exchanges among atoms placed within their
field, which adds to the inherent free space dipole-dipole coupling. Typically,
the single atom free space decay rate largely surpasses the emission rate into
the guided fiber modes. However, scaling up the atom number as well as the
system size amounts to entering a collective emission regime, where
fiber-induced superradiant spontaneous emission dominates over free space
decay. We numerically study this super- and subradiant decay of highly excited
atomic states for one or several transverse fiber modes as present in hollow
core fibers. As particular excitation scenarios we compare the decay of a
totally inverted state to the case of Pi/2 pulses applied transversely or along
the fiber axis as in standard Ramsey or Rabi interferometry. While a mean field
approach fails to correctly describe the initiation of superradiance, a
second-order approximation accounting for pairwise atom-atom quantum
correlations generally proves sufficient to reliably describe superradiance of
ensembles from two to a few hundred particles. In contrast, a full account of
subradiance requires the inclusion of all higher order quantum correlations.
Considering multiple guided modes introduces a natural effective cut-off for
the interaction range emerging from the dephasing of different fiber
contributions.

matrices whose full eigenvalue decomposition can be stably computed in
quadratic computing com plexity. Recently, fast and reliable eigensolvers
dealing with low rank perturbations of unitary and Hermitian matrices were
proposed. These structured eigenvalue problems appear naturally when computing
roots, via confederate linearizations, of polynomials expressed in, e.g., the
monomial or Chebyshev basis. Often, however, it is not known beforehand whether
or not a matrix can be written as the sum of an Hermitian or unitary matrix
plus a low rank perturbation. We propose necessary and sufficient conditions
characterizing the class of Hermitian or unitary plus low rank matrices. The
number of singular values deviating from 1 determines the rank of a
perturbation to bring a matrix to unitary form. A similar condition holds for
Hermitian matrices; the eigenvalues of the skew-Hermitian part differing from 0
dictate the rank of the perturbation. We prove that these relations are linked
via the Cayley transform. Based on these conditions we are able to identify the
closest Hermitian and unitary plus low rank matrix in Frobenius and spectral
norm and a practical Lanczos iteration to detect the low rank perturbation is
presented. Numerical tests prove that this straightforward algorithm is robust

modeled by a viscous drag force term plus a stochastic Langevin-like term. Two
independent but complementary approaches are followed to achieve exact results.
First, to keep the structure of the Boltzmann collision operator, the so-called
inelastic Maxwell models (IMM) are considered. In this model, since the
collision rate is independent of the relative velocity of the two colliding
particles, the forms of the collisional moments can be obtained without the
knowledge of the velocity distribution function. As a complement of the
previous effort, a BGK-type kinetic model adapted to granular gases is solved
to get the velocity moments of the velocity distribution function. The
analytical predictions of the rheological properties (which are \emph{exactly}
obtained in terms of the coefficient of restitution $\alpha$ and the reduced
shear rate $a^*$) show in general an excellent agreement with event-driven
simulations performed for inelastic hard spheres. In particular, both
theoretical approaches show clearly that the temperature and non-Newtonian
viscosity exhibit an $S$ shape in a plane of stress-strain rate (discontinuous
shear thickening effect). With respect to the fourth-degree velocity moments,
we find that while those moments have unphysical values for IMM in a certain
region of the parameter space of the system, they are well defined functions of
both $\alpha$ and $a^*$ in the case of the BGK kinetic model. The explicit
shear-rate dependence of the fourth-degree moments beyond this critical region
is also obtained and compared against available computer simulations.

Based on measurements by the Ulysses spacecraft and high-resolution
modelling of the motion of interstellar dust (ISD) through the heliosphere we
predict the ISD flow in the inner planetary system and on to the Earth. This is
the third paper in a series of three about the flow and filtering of the ISD.
  Methods. Micrometer- and sub-micrometer-sized dust particles are subject to
solar gravity and radiation pressure as well as to interactions with the
interplanetary magnetic field that result in a complex size-dependent flow
pattern of ISD in the planetary system. With high-resolution dynamical
modelling we study the time-resolved flux and mass distribution of ISD and the
requirements for detection of ISD near the Earth.
  Results. Along the Earth orbit the density, speed, and flow direction of ISD
depend strongly on the Earth's position and the size of the interstellar
grains. A broad maximum of the ISD flux (2x10^{-4}/m^2/s of particles with
radii >~0.3\mu m) occurs in March when the Earth moves against the ISD flow.
During this time period the relative speed with respect to the Earth is highest
(~60 km/s), whereas in September when the Earth moves with the ISD flow, both
the flux and the speed are lowest (<~10 km/s). The mean ISD mass flow on to the
Earth is ~100 kg/year with the highest flux of ~3.5kg/day occurring for about 2
weeks close to the end of the year when the Earth passes near the narrow
gravitational focus region downstream from the Sun. The phase of the 22-year
solar wind cycle has a strong effect on the number density and flow of
sub-micrometer-sized ISD particles. During the years of maximum electromagnetic
focussing (year 2031 +/- 3) there is a chance that ISD particles with sizes
even below 0.1\mu m can reach the Earth.
  Conclusions. We demonstrate that ISD can be effectively detected, analysed,
and collected by space probes at 1 AU distance from the Sun.

effective metallic carrier density of the system. The main findings are: (1) a
phonon scattering induced linear-in-T resistivity could persist to arbitrarily
low T in the dilute limit independent of the Debye temperature ($T_D$) although
eventually the low-T resistivity turns over to the expected Bloch-Gruneisen
(BG) behavior with $T^5$ ($T^4$) dependence, in 3D (2D) respectively; (2)
because of low values of n, the phonon-induced resistivity could be very high
in the system; (3) the resistivity shows an intrinsic saturation effect at very
high temperatures (for $T>T_D$), and in fact, decreases with increasing T above
a high crossover temperature with this crossover being dependent on both $T_D$
and n in a non-universal manner. We also provide high-T linear-in-T resistivity
results for 2D and 3D Dirac materials. Our work brings out the universal
features of phonon-induced transport in dilute metals, and we comment on
possible implications of our results for strange metals, emphasizing that the
mere observation of a linear-in-T metallic resistivity at low temperatures or a
very high metallic resistivity at high temperatures is not necessarily a reason
to invoke an underlying quantum critical strange metal behavior. We discuss the
temperature variation of the effective transport scattering rate showing that
the scattering rate could be below or above $k_BT$, and in particular, purely

Multilinear Tensor Decomposition (MTD) model, it is essential to estimate the
rank of the underlying multilinear tensor from the noisy observation tensor. In
this paper, we propose a Robust MTD (R-MTD) method, which jointly estimates the
multilinear rank and the loading matrices. Based on the low-rank property and
an over-estimation of the core tensor, this joint estimation problem is solved
by promoting (group) sparsity of the over-estimated core tensor. Group sparsity
is promoted using mixed-norms. Then we establish a link between the mixed-norms
and the nuclear norm, showing that mixed-norms are better candidates for a
convex envelope of the rank. After several iterations of the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), the Minimum Description Length (MDL)
criterion computed from the eigenvalues of the unfolding matrices of the
estimated core tensor is minimized in order to estimate the multilinear rank.
The latter is then used to estimate more accurately the loading matrices. We
further develop another R-MTD method, called R-OMTD, by imposing an
orthonormality constraint on each loading matrix in order to decrease the
computation complexity. A series of simulated noisy tensor and real-world data
are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared with
state-of-the-art methods.

we present such a content placement strategy, UtilCache, that is both effective

When the cache replacement policy tends to maintain popular contents, UtilCache
attains low link cost. In terms of practicality, UtilCache introduces little
coordination overhead because of piggybacked collaborative messages, and its
computational complexity depends mainly on content replacement policy, which

of UtilCache, as it saves nearly 40% link cost more than current ICN design.

the problem, the possibility of interbody collisions was taken into account,
the collisions being assumed to be absolutely inelastic. Forces external to the
body cluster under consideration were ignored. Among all the internal force
factors acting within the cluster, only the gravitational interaction was taken

assumed to remain constant during the entire evolution. The Cauchy problem with
natural initial conditions was considered. To check the process of solution,
the so-called rotation curve was used which represents the current radial

The reason lies on the difficulty of extracting essential bits during operating

zero bits occupy as high as 68.9% fraction in the overall weights of modern
deep convolutional neural network models, this paper firstly proposes a weight

either zero value weights or zero bits in non-zero weights, simultaneously.
Besides, a split-and-accumulate (SAC) computing pattern in replacement of
conventional MAC, as well as the corresponding hardware accelerator design

we perform a deep analysis on the released Alibaba workload dataset, from the
perspective of anomaly analysis and diagnosis. Through data preprocessing, node
similarity analysis based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), co-located workloads
characteristics analysis and anomaly analysis based on iForest, we reveals
several insights including: (1) The performance discrepancy of machines in
Alibaba's production cluster is relatively large, for the distribution and
resource utilization of co-located workloads is not balanced. For instance, the
resource utilization (especially memory utilization) of batch jobs is
fluctuating and not as stable as that of online containers, and the reason is
that online containers are long-running jobs with more memory-demanding and
most batch jobs are short jobs, (2) Based on the distribution of co-located
workload instance numbers, the machines can be classified into 8 workload
distribution categories1. And most patterns of machine resource utilization
curves are similar in the same workload distribution category. (3) In addition
to the system failures, unreasonable scheduling and workload imbalance are the
main causes of anomalies in Alibaba's cluster.

two-photon excitation, previous studies done by using wavelength tunable pulsed

maximum time delay rather than the spectral width of the pulses. We have used
the method to investigate the vibrational levels of the S1 state. In our

measurements in the rotating frame, which require fewer data points along the
time delay thereby significantly reducing the measurement time.

advantage of POMC over generalized greedy algorithms. We also consider EAMC, a
new evolutionary algorithm with polynomial expected time guarantee to maintain
$\phi$ approximation ratio, and NSGA-II with two different population sizes as
advanced multi-objective optimization algorithm, to demonstrate their
challenges in optimizing the maximum coverage problem. Our empirical analysis

change and global population movements leading to the widespread loss of
biodiversity and the disruption of key ecological services. Ecosystems
characterized primarily by mutualistic relationships between species such as
plant-pollinator interactions may be particularly vulnerable to such
perturbations because the loss of biodiversity can cause extinction cascades
that can compromise the entire network. Here, we develop a general restoration
strategy based on network-science for degraded ecosystems. Specifically, we
show that network topology can be used to identify the optimal sequence of
species reintroductions needed to maximize biodiversity gains following partial
and full ecosystem collapse. This restoration strategy generalizes across
topologically-disparate and geographically-distributed ecosystems.
Additionally, we find that although higher connectance and diversity promote
persistence in pristine ecosystems, these attributes reduce the effectiveness
of restoration efforts in degraded networks. Hence, focusing on restoring the
factors that promote persistence in pristine ecosystems may yield suboptimal
recovery strategies for degraded ecosystems. Overall, our results have
important insights for designing effective ecosystem restoration strategies to

we observe a radially propagating wave, beyond which the sheet remains
approximately planar but is decorated by a series of radial wrinkles whose
wavelength grows in time. We develop a mathematical model to describe these
phenomena by exploiting the asymptotic limit in which the bending stiffness is
small compared to stresses in the sheet. The results of this analysis show
that, at a time $t$ after impact, the transverse wave is located at a radial
distance $r\sim t^{1/2}$ from the impactor, in contrast to the classic $r\sim
t^{2/3}$ scaling observed for capillary--inertia ripples produced by dropping a
stone into a pond. We describe the shape of this wave, starting from the
simplest case of a point impactor, but subsequently addressing a finite-radius
spherical impactor, contrasting this case with the classic Wagner theory of
impact. We show also that the coarsening of wrinkles in the flat portion of the
sheet is controlled by the inertia of the underlying liquid: short-wavelength,
small-amplitude wrinkles form at early times since they accommodate the
geometrically-imposed compression without significantly displacing the
underlying liquid. As time progresses, the liquid accelerates and the wrinkles
grow larger and coarsen. We explain this coarsening quantitatively using
numerical simulations and scaling arguments, and we compare our predictions
with experimental data.

  Initialized Caputo Derivatives","17 pages",,,,"math.GM","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Initialization of fractional differential equations remains an ongoing
problem. In recent years, the initialization function approach and the infinite
state approach provide two effective ways to deal with this problem. The
purpose of this paper is to prove the equivalence of the initialized
Riemann-Liouville derivatives and the initialized Caputo derivatives with
arbitrary orders. By synthesizing the above two initialization theories, the
diffusive representations of the two initialized derivatives with arbitrary
orders are derived. Laplace transforms of the two initialized derivatives are
shown to be equal. As a result, the two most commonly used derivatives are
proved to be equivalent when initial conditions are properly imposed.

prominence in recent years with the discovery that it unifies a rich variety of
combinatorial optimization problems. By its association with the Ising problem
in physics, the QUBO model has emerged as an underpinning of the quantum
computing area known as quantum annealing and has become a subject of study in
neuromorphic computing. Through these connections, QUBO models lie at the heart
of experimentation carried out with quantum computers developed by D-Wave
Systems and neuromorphic computers developed by IBM. Computational experience
is being amassed by both the classical and the quantum computing communities
that highlights not only the potential of the QUBO model but also its
effectiveness as an alternative to traditional modeling and solution
methodologies. This tutorial discloses the basic features of the QUBO model
that give it the power and flexibility to encompass the range of applications
that have thrust it onto center stage of the optimization field. We show how
many different types of constraining relationships arising in practice can be
embodied within the ""unconstrained"" QUBO formulation in a very natural manner
using penalty functions, yielding exact model representations in contrast to
the approximate representations produced by customary uses of penalty
functions. Each step of generating such models is illustrated in detail by
simple numerical examples, to highlight the convenience of using QUBO models in
numerous settings. We also describe recent innovations for solving QUBO models
that offer a fertile avenue for integrating classical and quantum computing and
for applying these models in machine learning.

deaths and many social problems. Accurate relapse prediction is of practical
importance for recovering patients since relapse prediction promotes timely
relapse preventions that help patients stay clean. In this paper, we introduce
a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model to predict the addiction relapses
based on sentiment images and social influences. Experimental results on real
social media data from Reddit.com demonstrate that the GAN model delivers a
better performance than comparable alternative techniques. The sentiment images
generated by the model show that relapse is closely connected with two emotions
`joy' and `negative'. This work is one of the first attempts to predict
relapses using massive social media data and generative adversarial nets. The
proposed method, combined with knowledge of social media mining, has the
potential to revolutionize the practice of opioid addiction prevention and
treatment.

animal models, and is of growing interest as an aetiological explanation in
psychopathologies. Circadian modulation of reward function has been
demonstrated in human behavioural data, but understanding at the neural level
is limited. In 2017, our group published results of a first step in addressing
this deficit, demonstrating a diurnal rhythm in fMRI-measured reward
activation. In 2018, Steel et al wrote a constructive critique of our findings,
and the aim of this paper is to outline how future research could improve on
our first proof-of-concept study. Key challenges include addressing divergent
and convergent validity (by addressing non-reward neural variation, and testing
for absence of variation in threat-related pathways), preregistration and power
analysis to protect against false positives, wider range of fMRI methods (to
directly test our post-hoc hypothesis of some form of reward prediction error,
and multiple phases of reward), the parallel collection of behavioural data
(particularly self-reported positive affect, and actigraphically measured
activity) to illuminate the nature of the reward activation across the day, and
some attempt to parse out circadian versus homeostatic/masking influences on
any observed diurnal rhythm in neural reward activation.

textual description from a given floor plan image for the visually impaired. A
visually impaired person can navigate in an indoor environment using the
textual description generated by SUGAMAN. With the help of a text reader
software, the target user can understand the rooms within the building and
arrangement of furniture to navigate. SUGAMAN is the first framework for
describing a floor plan and giving direction for obstacle-free movement within
a building. We learn $5$ classes of room categories from $1355$ room image
samples under a supervised learning paradigm. These learned annotations are fed
into a description synthesis framework to yield a holistic description of a
floor plan image. We demonstrate the performance of various supervised
classifiers on room learning. We also provide a comparative analysis of system
generated and human written descriptions. SUGAMAN gives state of the art
performance on challenging, real-world floor plan images. This work can be
applied to areas like understanding floor plans of historical monuments,
stability analysis of buildings, and retrieval.

  Crowdsensing","13 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In mobile crowdsensing, finding the best match between tasks and users is
crucial to ensure both the quality and effectiveness of a crowdsensing system.
Existing works usually assume a centralized task assignment by the crowdsensing
platform, without addressing the need of fine-grained personalized task
matching. In this paper, we argue that it is essential to match tasks to users
based on a careful characterization of both the users' preference and
reliability. To that end, we propose a personalized task recommender system for
mobile crowdsensing, which recommends tasks to users based on a recommendation
score that jointly takes each user's preference and reliability into
consideration. We first present a hybrid preference metric to characterize
users' preference by exploiting their implicit feedback. Then, to profile
users' reliability levels, we formalize the problem as a semi-supervised
learning model, and propose an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm to
solve the problem. For some tasks that lack users' historical information, we
further propose a matrix factorization method to infer the users' reliability
levels on those tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the
performance of our system, and the evaluation results demonstrate that our
system can achieve superior performance to the benchmarks in both user
profiling and personalized task recommendation.

  Feature Distribution Using Sequential Change-Point Detection Method","20 pages",,,,"stat.AP cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The high structural deficient rate poses serious risks to the operation of
many bridges and buildings. To prevent critical damage and structural collapse,
a quick structural health diagnosis tool is needed during normal operation or
immediately after extreme events. In structural health monitoring (SHM), many
existing works will have limited performance in the quick damage identification
process because 1) the damage event needs to be identified with short delay and
2) the post-damage information is usually unavailable. To address these
drawbacks, we propose a new damage detection and localization approach based on
stochastic time series analysis. Specifically, the damage sensitive features
are extracted from vibration signals and follow different distributions before
and after a damage event. Hence, we use the optimal change point detection
theory to find damage occurrence time. As the existing change point detectors
require the post-damage feature distribution, which is unavailable in SHM, we
propose a maximum likelihood method to learn the distribution parameters from
the time-series data. The proposed damage detection using estimated parameters
also achieves the optimal performance. Also, we utilize the detection results
to find damage location without any further computation. Validation results
show highly accurate damage identification in American Society of Civil
Engineers benchmark structure and two shake table experiments.

promises a wide range of impactful experiments from dark-field imaging of
material microstructure to precise measurements of fundamental constants.
However, the contrast of 3 % obtained using this moir\'e interferometer was
well below the theoretical prediction of 30 % using ideal gratings. It is
suspected that non-ideal aspects of the phase-gratings was a leading
contributor to this deficiency and that phase-gratings needed to be
quantitatively assessed and optimized. Here we characterize neutron diffraction
from phase-gratings using Bragg diffraction crystals to determine the optimal
phase-grating orientations. We show well-defined diffraction peaks and explore
perturbations to the diffraction peaks and the effects on interferometer
contrast as a function of grating alignment. This technique promises to improve
the contrast of the grating interferometers by providing in-situ aides to
grating alignment.
