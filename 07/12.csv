of the velocity components $v_x$ and $v_y$ in different points near to the jet

cross-cut at the plane $x=$0.1 Mm and find significant transverse displacements
of the jet. By analyzing temperature isosurfaces of $10^{4}$ K with the
distribution of $v_x$, we find that if the line-of-sight (LOS) is approximately
perpendicular to the jet axis then there is both motion towards and away from
the observer across the width of the jet. This red-blue shift pattern of the
jet is caused by rotational motion, initially clockwise and anti-clockwise
afterwards, which could be interpreted as torsional motion. From a nearly

well-known human IQ test. To succeed at this challenge, models must cope with
various generalisation `regimes' in which the training and test data differ in
clearly-defined ways. We show that popular models such as ResNets perform
poorly, even when the training and test sets differ only minimally, and we
present a novel architecture, with a structure designed to encourage reasoning,
that does significantly better. When we vary the way in which the test
questions and training data differ, we find that our model is notably
proficient at certain forms of generalisation, but notably weak at others. We
further show that the model's ability to generalise improves markedly if it is
trained to predict symbolic explanations for its answers. Altogether, we
introduce and explore ways to both measure and induce stronger abstract
reasoning in neural networks. Our freely-available dataset should motivate
further progress in this direction.

semi-numerical patchy reionization models, one with a fluctuating UVB and
another with a fluctuating temperature field. Our measurements show a steep
rise in opacity at $z\gtrsim5.0$ and an increased scatter and thus support the
picture of a spatially inhomogeneous reionization process, consistent with
previous work. However, we measure significantly higher optical depths at
$5.3\lesssim z\lesssim5.7$ than previous studies, which reduces the contrast

a 6H-perovskite makes the system insulating enough to carry out MD
investigation. The compound is ferromagnetically ordered below 24 K (TC),

clearly traces the magnetic ordering, manifesting a peak at the onset of TC,

results indicate the presence of MD coupling in this compound, which is further
confirmed by the H-dependence of the dielectric constant. Interestingly, a
cross-over of the sign of MD coupling is observed at T ~ T2. We conclude that
two different mechanism controls the MD coupling which yields positive and
negative coupling, respectively. Both mechanisms are competing as a function of
temperature and magnetic field. This brings us a step closer to design and

linearisation of the transient and advection terms of the governing nonlinear

expansion waves. The linearisation and iterative solution strategy applied to
discretise and solve the nonlinear governing equations is found to have a
significant influence on the performance and stability of the numerical
algorithm. The Newton linearisation of the transient terms of the momentum and
energy equations is shown to yield a significantly improved convergence of the
iterative solution algorithm compared to a fixed-coefficient linearisation,
while the linearisation of the advection terms leads to substantial differences
in performance and stability at large Mach numbers and large Courant numbers.
It is further shown that the consistent Newton linearisation of all transient

coupled pressure-based algorithms, to eliminate all forms of underrelaxation
and provides a clear performance benefit for flows in all Mach number regimes.

consistent with zero, allowing us to constrain the resolved photon contribution

investigate the fundamental qualitative and quantitative properties of these

cooperative protocols, which consist of multiple agents that are coupled
together via an undirected state-dependent graph. We develop a representation
of the system solution by decomposing the nonlinear system utilizing ideas from
the Koopman operator theory and its spectral analysis. We use recent results on
the extensions of the well-known Hartman theorem for hyperbolic systems to
establish a connection between the original nonlinear dynamics and the
linearized dynamics in terms of Koopman spectral properties. The expected value
of the output energy of the nonlinear protocol, which is related to the notions
of coherence and robustness in dynamical networks, is evaluated and
characterized in terms of Koopman eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes.
Spectral representation of the performance measure enables us to develop
algorithmic methods to assess the performance of this class of nonlinear
dynamical networks as a function of their graph topology. Finally, we propose a
scalable computational method for approximation of the components of the
Koopman mode decomposition, which is necessary to evaluate the systemic
performance measure of the nonlinear dynamic network.

over 25 years. The constraints in these models are derived from genome
annotations, measured macro-molecular composition of cells, and by measuring
the cell's growth rate and metabolism in different conditions. The cellular
goal (the optimization problem that the cell is trying to solve) can be
challenging to derive experimentally for many organisms, including human or
mammalian cells, which have complex metabolic capabilities and are not well
understood. Existing approaches to learning goals from data include (a)
estimating a linear objective function, or (b) estimating linear constraints
that model complex biochemical reactions and constrain the cell's operation.
The latter approach is important because often the known/observed biochemical
reactions are not enough to explain observations, and hence there is a need to
extend automatically the model complexity by learning new chemical reactions.
However, this leads to nonconvex optimization problems, and existing tools
cannot scale to realistically large metabolic models. Hence, constraint
estimation is still used sparingly despite its benefits for modeling cell
metabolism, which is important for developing novel antimicrobials against
pathogens, discovering cancer drug targets, and producing value-added
chemicals. Here, we develop the first approach to estimating constraint
reactions from data that can scale to realistically large metabolic models.
Previous tools have been used on problems having less than 75 biochemical
reactions and 60 metabolites, which limits real-life-size applications. We
perform extensive experiments using 75 large-scale metabolic network models for
different organisms (including bacteria, yeasts, and mammals) and show that our
algorithm can recover cellular constraint reactions, even when some
measurements are missing.

to be a metal-poor system with a significant [Fe/H] spread (median [Fe/H] =

mass. We report the presence of a mild metallicity gradient compatible with

different evolutionary phases in ancillary SuprimeCam photometric data. There
are tentative indications of two chemo-kinematically distinct sub-populations,
with the more metal-poor stars showing a hotter kinematics than the
metal-richer ones. Furthermore, the photometric dataset reveals the presence of
a foreground population that most likely belongs to the Sagittarius stream.
This study represents a first comprehensive analysis of Cetus chemo-kinematic
properties. Our results add Cetus to the growing scatter in stellar-dark matter
halo properties in low-mass galactic systems. The presence of a metallicity

which a master node is connected to a set of worker nodes, via a shared link,
in order to communicate a set of files to the worker nodes. The master node has
access to a database of files. In every shuffling iteration, each worker node
processes a new subset of files, and has excess storage to partially cache the
remaining files, assuming the cached files are uncoded. The caches of the
worker nodes are updated every iteration, and they should be designed to
satisfy any possible unknown permutation of the files in subsequent iterations.
For this problem, we characterize the exact load-memory trade-off for
worst-case shuffling by deriving the minimum communication load for a given
storage capacity per worker node. As a byproduct, the exact load-memory
trade-off for any shuffling is characterized when the number of files is equal
to the number of worker nodes. We propose a novel deterministic coded shuffling
scheme, which improves the state of the art, by exploiting the cache memories
to create coded functions that can be decoded by several worker nodes. Then, we

\mathbb{R}^n$ from $m$ quadratic observations, where $m$ is to be minimized. As
is common in many imaging problems, natural signals are considered sparse with
respect to a known basis, and the generic sparsity prior is enforced via
$\ell_1$ regularization. While successful in the realm of linear inverse
problems, such $\ell_1$ methods have encountered possibly fundamental
limitations, as no computationally efficient algorithm for phase retrieval of a
$k$-sparse signal has been proven to succeed with fewer than $O(k^2\log n)$
generic measurements, exceeding the theoretical optimum of $O(k \log n)$. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework for phase retrieval by 1) modeling
natural signals as being in the range of a deep generative neural network $G :
\mathbb{R}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and 2) enforcing this prior directly by
optimizing an empirical risk objective over the domain of the generator. Our
formulation has provably favorable global geometry for gradient methods, as
soon as $m = O(kd^2\log n)$, where $d$ is the depth of the network.
Specifically, when suitable deterministic conditions on the generator and
measurement matrix are met, we construct a descent direction for any point
outside of a small neighborhood around the unique global minimizer and its
negative multiple, and show that such conditions hold with high probability
under Gaussian ensembles of multilayer fully-connected generator networks and
measurement matrices. This formulation for structured phase retrieval thus has
two advantages over sparsity based methods: 1) deep generative priors can more
tightly represent natural signals and 2) information theoretically optimal
sample complexity. We corroborate these results with experiments showing that
exploiting generative models in phase retrieval tasks outperforms sparse phase
retrieval methods.

$\approx$ 21 keV, with a 3 to 30 keV luminosity of approximately
4.9$\times$10$^{32}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. The spectrum is also consistent with the
presence of reflection with an amplitude of 1.0, although in that case, the
best-fit plasma temperature is 20-25% lower. The UV to X-ray luminosity ratio
of SU Lyn changed significantly between 2015 and 2016. We interpret this as a
consequence of a drop by almost 90% in the accretion rate. Whereas the UV
luminosity of the disk responded linearly, the luminosity of the optically thin
(hard X-ray) emission from the boundary layer remained roughly constant because
the boundary layer changed from partially optically thick to almost completely
optically thin. Under this interpretation, we place a lower limit on the white
dwarf mass of 0.7 M$_{\odot}$ (0.8 M$_{\odot}$ if we neglect reflection).

and the star-forming galaxies in which they form. GRB 100418A, at a z = 0.6239,
had a bright optical and radio afterglow, and a luminous star-forming host
galaxy. This allowed us to study the radiation of the explosion as well as the
interstellar medium of the host both in absorption and emission. We collected
photometric data from radio to X-ray wavelengths to study the evolution of the
afterglow and the contribution of a possible supernova and three X-shooter
spectra obtained during the first 60 hr. The light curve shows a very fast
optical rebrightening, with an amplitude of 3 magnitudes, starting 2.4 hr after
the GRB onset. This cannot be explained by a standard external shock model and
requires other contributions, such as late central-engine activity. Two weeks
after the burst we detect an excess in the light curve consistent with a SN
with peak absolute magnitude M_V = -18.5 mag, among the faintest GRB-SNe
detected to date. The host galaxy shows two components in emission, with
velocities differing by 130 km s^-1, but otherwise having similar properties.
While some absorption and emission components coincide, the absorbing gas spans
much higher velocities, indicating the presence of gas beyond the star-forming
regions. The host has a star-formation rate of 12.2 M_sol yr^-1, a metallicity
of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.55 and a mass of 1.6x10^9 M_sol. GRB 100418A is a member
of a class of afterglow light curves which show a steep rebrightening in the
optical during the first day, which cannot be explained by traditional models.
Its very faint associated SN shows that GRB-SNe can have a larger dispersion in
luminosities than previously seen. Furthermore, we have obtained a complete
view of the host of GRB 100418A owing to its spectrum, which contains a
remarkable number of both emission and absorption lines.

cornerstone in the late evolution of massive stars before their core collapse.
As core-helium burning, hydrogen-free objects with huge mass-loss, they are
likely the last observable stage before collapse and thus promising progenitor
candidates for type Ib/c supernovae. Their strong mass-loss furthermore
provides challenges and constraints to the theory of radiatively driven winds.
Thus, the determination of the WC star parameters is of major importance for
several astrophysical fields. With Gaia DR2, for the first time parallaxes for
a large sample of Galactic WC stars are available, removing major uncertainties
inherent to earlier studies. In this work, we re-examine the sample from Sander
et al. (2012) to derive key properties of the Galactic WC population. All
quantities depending on the distance are updated, while the underlying spectral
analyses remain untouched. Contrasting earlier assumptions, our study yields
that WC stars of the same subtype can significantly vary in absolute magnitude.
With Gaia DR2, the picture of the Galactic WC population becomes more complex:
We obtain luminosities ranging from log L = 4.9 to 6.0 with one outlier having
log L = 4.7. This indicates that the WC stars are likely formed from a broader
initial mass range than previously assumed. We obtain mass-loss rates ranging
between log Mdot = -5.1 and -4.1, with Mdot propto L^0.68 and a linear scaling
of the modified wind momentum with luminosity. We discuss the implications for
stellar evolution, including unsolved issues regarding the need of envelope
inflation to address the WR radius problem, and the open questions in regard to
the connection of WR stars with Gamma-ray bursts. WC and WO stars are
progenitors of massive black holes, collapsing either silently or in a
supernova that most-likely has to be preceded by a WO stage.

structure evident in the $160$ $\mu$m emission. By modelling the encounter
using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) we reproduce the main features of
the observed extended structure (`V'-shaped emission pointing west of HV Tau
and a tail-like structure extending east of DO Tau). We suggest that HV Tau and
DO Tau formed together in a quadruple system on a scale of $\sim 5000$ au
($0.025$ pc).

structure, with a relativistic jet pointing to the Earth, offers a natural
accelerator of particles and for this reason a perfect birthplace of high
energy neutrinos. A good characterisation of the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of these sources can improve the understanding of the physical
composition of the source and the emission processes involved. Starting from
our previous works in which we assumed a correlation between the $\gamma$-ray
and the neutrino flux of the BL Lacs of the 2FHL catalogue (detected by Fermi
above 50GeV), we select those BL Lac in spatial correlation with the IceCube
events. We obtain a sample of 7 sources and we start an observational campaign
to have a better characterisation of the synchrotron peak. During the analysis
of the data a new source has been added because of its position inside the
angular uncertainty of a muon track event detected by IceCube. This source,
namely TXS0506+056, was in a high-state during the neutrino event and we will
consider it as benchmark to check the proprieties of the other sources of the
sample during the related neutrino detection.
  We obtain a better characterisation of the SED for the sources of our sample.
A prospective extreme Blazar, a very peculiar low synchrotron peak (LSP) source
with a large separation of the two peaks and a \textit{twin} of TXS0506+056
come up. We also provide the $\gamma$-ray light curve to check the trend of the

monitored the object in the very-high-energy (VHE) band with the MAGIC
telescopes for $\sim$41 hours from 1.3 to 40.4 days after the neutrino

quasi-simultaneous neutrino and broadband electromagnetic observations with a
novel one-zone lepto-hadronic model, based on interactions of electrons and
protons co-accelerated in the jet with external photons originating from a
slow-moving plasma sheath surrounding the faster jet spine. We can reproduce
the multiwavelength spectra of TXS 0506+056 with neutrino rate and energy
compatible with IceCube-170922A, and with plausible values for the jet power of
$\sim 10^{45} - 4 \times 10^{46} {\rm erg \ s^{-1}}$. The steep spectrum
observed by MAGIC is concordant with internal $\gamma\gamma$ absorption above a
few tens of GeV entailed by photohadronic production of a $\sim$290 TeV
neutrino, corroborating a genuine connection between the multi-messenger
signals. In contrast to previous predictions of predominantly hadronic emission
from neutrino sources, the gamma-rays can be mostly ascribed to inverse Compton
up-scattering of external photons by accelerated electrons. The X-ray and VHE
bands provide crucial constraints on the emission from both accelerated
electrons and protons. We infer that the maximum energy of protons in the jet
co-moving frame can be in the range $\sim 10^{14}$ to $10^{18}$ eV.

have measured the rotation of the host star and its solar-like magnetic cycle.
Accounting for this cycle in our velocimetric analysis of the system allows us
to revise the properties of the outermost giant planet and its four planetary
companions. The innermost planet 55 Cnc e is an unusually close-in super-Earth,
whose transits have allowed for detailed follow-up studies. Recent observations
favor the presence of a substantial atmosphere yet its composition, and the
nature of the planet, remain unknown. We combined our derived planet mass (Mp =
8.0+-0.3 Mearth) with refined measurement of its optical radius derived from
HST/STIS observations (Rp = 1.88+-0.03 Rearth over 530-750nm) to revise the
density of 55 Cnc e (rho = 6.7+-0.4 g cm-3). Based on these revised properties
we have characterized possible interiors of 55 Cnc e using a generalized
Bayesian model. We confirm that the planet is likely surrounded by a
heavyweight atmosphere, contributing a few percents of the planet radius. While
we cannot exclude the presence of a water layer underneath the atmosphere, this
scenario is unlikely given the observations of the planet across the entire
spectrum and its strong irradiation. Follow-up observations of the system in
photometry and in spectroscopy over different time-scales are needed to further
investigate the nature and origin of this iconic super-Earth.

Bayesian approach where the unknown quantity is a spatial field. A structured
Bayesian Gaussian process latent variable model is used both to construct a
low-dimensional generative model of the sample-based stochastic prior as well
as a surrogate for the forward evaluation. Its Bayesian formulation captures
epistemic uncertainty introduced by the limited number of input and output
examples, automatically selects an appropriate dimensionality for the learned
latent representation of the data, and rigorously propagates the uncertainty of
the data-driven dimensionality reduction of the stochastic space through the
forward model surrogate. The structured Gaussian process model explicitly
leverages spatial information for an informative generative prior to improve
sample efficiency while achieving computational tractability through Kronecker
product decompositions of the relevant kernel matrices. Importantly, the
Bayesian inversion is carried out by solving a variational optimization
problem, replacing traditional computationally-expensive Monte Carlo sampling.
The methodology is demonstrated on an elliptic PDE and is shown to return
well-calibrated posteriors and is tractable with latent spaces with over 100

mobile sensors can drastically alter our ability to study such complex
phenomena. Currently available observational data of atmospheric boundary layer
physics is so sparse and infrequent which significantly limits analysis. With
the quantity and resolution of the data that can be measured using a swarm of

identifying optimal trajectories to fly the UAS to obtain the relevant

"1807.04308","Amariah Becker","Amariah Becker and Alice Paul","A Framework for Vehicle Routing Approximation Schemes in Trees",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a general framework for designing polynomial-time approximation
schemes (PTASs) for various vehicle routing problems in trees. In these
problems, the goal is to optimally route a fleet of vehicles, originating at a
depot, to serve a set of clients, subject to various constraints. For example,
in Minimum Makespan Vehicle Routing, the number of vehicles is fixed, and the
objective is to minimize the longest distance traveled by a single vehicle. Our
main insight is that we can often greatly restrict the set of potential
solutions without adding too much to the optimal solution cost. This
simplification relies on partitioning the tree into clusters such that there
exists a near-optimal solution in which every vehicle that visits a given
cluster takes on one of a few forms. In particular, only a small number of
vehicles serve clients in any given cluster. By using these coarser building
blocks, a dynamic programming algorithm can find a near-optimal solution in
polynomial time. We show that the framework is flexible enough to give PTASs
for many problems, including Minimum Makespan Vehicle Routing,
Distance-Constrained Vehicle Routing, Capacitated Vehicle Routing, and School
Bus Routing, and can be extended to the multiple depot setting.

  random matrix is less than one with high probability",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by the Koml\'os conjecture in combinatorial discrepancy, we study
the discrepancy of random matrices with $m$ rows and $n$ independent columns
drawn from a bounded lattice random variable. It is known that for $n$ tending
to infinity and $m$ fixed, with high probability the $\ell_\infty$-discrepancy
is at most twice the $\ell_\infty$-covering radius of the integer span of the
support of the random variable. However, the easy argument for the above fact
gives no concrete bounds on the failure probability in terms of $n$. We prove
that the failure probability is inverse polynomial in $m, n$ and some
well-motivated parameters of the random variable. We also obtain the analogous
bounds for the discrepancy in arbitrary norms.
  We apply these results to two random models of interest. For random
$t$-sparse matrices, i.e. uniformly random matrices with $t$ ones and $m-t$
zeroes in each column, we show that the $\ell_\infty$-discrepancy is at most
$2$ with probability $1 - O(\sqrt{ \log n/n})$ for $n = \Omega(m^3 \log^2 m)$.
This improves on a bound proved by Ezra and Lovett (Ezra and Lovett,
Approx+Random, 2016) showing that the same is true for $n$ at least $m^t$. For
matrices with random unit vector columns, we show that the
$\ell_\infty$-discrepancy is $O(\exp(\sqrt{ n/m^3}))$ with probability $1 -
O(\sqrt{ \log n/n})$ for $n = \Omega(m^3 \log^2 m).$ Our approach, in the
spirit of Kuperberg, Lovett and Peled (G. Kuperberg, S. Lovett and R. Peled,
STOC 2012), uses Fourier analysis to prove that for $m \times n$ matrices $M$
with i.i.d. columns, and $m$ sufficiently large, the distribution of $My$ for
random $y \in \{-1,1\}^n$ obeys a local limit theorem.

to fully explain their dynamics under extreme conditions of high strain
gradients and small scales, which can nowadays be scrutinized. In such
conditions, corrections to the Volterra dislocation fields and to the
Peach-Koehler force, for example, become relevant. One way to go beyond the
Volterra solution is to consider other terms in the total Laurent series
solution. This is the so called core field. One of its consequences is to
predict a driving force on the dislocation due to background strain/stress
gradients, which has also been suggested by other core energy calculations.
Here we confirm its existence by presenting a direct observation of strain
gradients driving edge dislocations in 2D atomistic simulations. We show that,
in systems with scale invariance, the results for such core force can be used
to obtain the total core energy, allowing a standard value for this energy to
be compared with other classical methods of obtaining it. The force measured in
our system differs from the prediction obtained by a direct core field
analysis. Moreover, we found that higher order gradients of strains can also
act as relevant forces.

quantum information processing and spintronic devices. Such applications
require protection of the spin states against quantum decoherence due to
interactions with the environment. While a single spin is easily disrupted, a
coupled-spin system can resist decoherence by employing a subspace of states
that is immune to magnetic field fluctuations. Here, we engineered the magnetic
interactions between the electron spins of two spin-1/2 atoms to create a clock
transition and thus enhance their spin coherence. To construct and electrically
access the desired spin structures, we use atom manipulation combined with
electron spin resonance (ESR) in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). We show
that a two-level system composed of a singlet state and a triplet state is
insensitive to local and global magnetic field noise, resulting in much longer
spin coherence times compared with individual atoms. Moreover, the spin
decoherence resulting from the interaction with tunneling electrons is markedly
reduced by a homodyne readout of ESR. These results demonstrate that
atomically-precise spin structures can be designed and assembled to yield
enhanced quantum coherence.

tilt parameter can also control the amount of loss in the medium, ranging from
lossless to dissipative when transitioning from type-I to type-II. Similarly,
by tuning either the frequency of the electromagnetic field or the chemical

permittivity of the Weyl semimetal transitions between positive and negative

compact metrizable spaces, we show that the small boundary property is
equivalent to a density version of almost finiteness, which we call almost
finiteness in measure, and that under this hypothesis the properties of almost
finiteness, comparison, and $m$-comparison for some nonnegative integer $m$ are
all equivalent. The proof combines an Ornstein-Weiss tiling argument with the
use of zero-dimensional extensions which are measure-isomorphic over singleton
fibres. These kinds of extensions are also employed to show that if every free
action of a given group on a zero-dimensional space is almost finite then so
are all free actions of the group on spaces with finite covering dimension.
Combined with recent results of Downarowicz-Zhang and
Conley-Jackson-Marks-Seward-Tucker-Drob on dynamical tilings and of
Castillejos-Evington-Tikuisis-White-Winter on the Toms-Winter conjecture, this
implies that crossed product C$^*$-algebras arising from free minimal actions
of groups with local subexponential growth on finite-dimensional spaces are
classifiable in the sense of Elliott's program. We show furthermore that, for
free actions of countably infinite amenable groups, the small boundary property
implies that the crossed product has uniform property $\Gamma$, which under
minimality confirms the Toms-Winter conjecture for such crossed products by the
aforementioned work of Castillejos-Evington-Tikuisis-White-Winter.

treatment that may be further combined with the existing therapeutic modalities
to enhance their effects. To investigate how OV could enhance chemotherapy, we
propose an ODE based model describing the interactions between tumour cells,
the immune response, and a treatment combination with chemotherapy and
oncolytic viruses. Stability analysis of the model with constant chemotherapy
treatment rates shows that without any form of treatment, a tumour would grow
to its maximum size. It also demonstrates that chemotherapy alone is capable of
clearing tumour cells provided that the drug efficacy is greater than the
intrinsic tumour growth rate. Furthermore, OV alone may not be able to clear
tumour cells from body tissue but would rather enhance chemotherapy if viruses
with high viral potency are used. To assess the combined effect of OV and
chemotherapy we use the forward sensitivity index to perform a sensitivity
analysis, with respect to chemotherapy key parameters, of the virus basic
reproductive number and the tumour endemic equilibrium. The results from this
sensitivity analysis indicate the existence of a critical dose of chemotherapy
above which no further significant reduction in the tumour population can be
observed. Numerical simulations show that a successful combinational therapy of
the chemotherapeutic drugs and viruses depends mostly on the virus burst size,
infection rate, and the amount of drugs supplied. Optimal control analysis was
performed, by means of Pontryagin's principle, to further refine predictions of
the model with constant treatment rates by accounting for the treatment costs

extreme cool core clusters known. The central galaxy contains $1.9\times

and disturbed, showing no evidence for a rotationally-supported structure in
equilibrium. $80\%$ of the gas is situated within the central 5 kpc of the
galactic center, while the remaining gas is located in a 20 kpc long filament.
The cold gas has likely condensed out of the hot atmosphere. The filament is
oriented along the edge of a putative X-ray cavity, suggesting that AGN
activity has stimulated condensation. This is enegetically feasible, although
the morphology is not as conclusive as systems whose molecular filaments trail
directly behind buoyant radio bubbles. The velocity gradient along the filament
is smooth and shallow. It is only consistent with free-fall if it lies within
$20^{\circ}$ of the plane of the sky. The abundance of clusters with comparably
low velocities suggests that the filament is not free-falling. Both the central
and filamentary gas are coincident with bright UV emission from ongoing star
formation. Star formation near the cluster core is consistent with the
Kennicutt-Schmidt law. The filament exhibits increased star formation surface
densities, possibly resulting from either the consumption of a finite molecular
gas supply or spatial variations in the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor.

these displacements enhance the cross section for transitions to E$_{\rm

quantitatively predict the respective Ti 1s near-edge spectra. Properly
accounting for atomic fluctuations greatly improves the agreement between
theoretical and experimental spectra. The evolution of relative strengths of

pediatric subjects. Statistical shape models (SSMs), the workhorse of most
state-of-the-art CXR-based lung field segmentation methods, do not efficiently
accommodate shape variation of the lung field during the pediatric
developmental stages. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a generic
lung field segmentation framework from CXR accommodating large shape variation
for adult and pediatric cohorts; (2) a deep representation learning detection
mechanism, \emph{ensemble space learning}, for robust object localization; and
(3) \emph{marginal shape deep learning} for the shape deformation parameter
estimation. Unlike the iterative approach of conventional SSMs, the proposed
shape learning mechanism transforms the parameter space into marginal subspaces
that are solvable efficiently using the recursive representation learning
mechanism. Furthermore, our method is the first to include the challenging
retro-cardiac region in the CXR-based lung segmentation for accurate lung
capacity estimation. The framework is evaluated on 668 CXRs of patients between
3 month to 89 year of age. We obtain a mean Dice similarity coefficient of
$0.96\pm0.03$ (including the retro-cardiac region). For a given accuracy, the
proposed approach is also found to be faster than conventional SSM-based
iterative segmentation methods. The computational simplicity of the proposed
generic framework could be similarly applied to the fast segmentation of other
deformable objects.

known as non-common path aberrations (NCPAs), and the planet intensity signal.
Frazin (ApJ, 2013) introduced a post-processing algorithm demonstrating that
simultaneous millisecond exposures in the science camera and wavefront sensor
(WFS) can be used with a statistical inference procedure to determine both the
series expanded NCPA coefficients and the planetary signal. We demonstrate, via
simulation, that using this algorithm in a closed-loop AO system, real-time
estimation and correction of the quasi-static NCPA is possible without separate
deformable mirror (DM) probes. Thus the use of this technique allows for the
removal of the quasi-static speckles that can be mistaken for planetary signals
without the need for new optical hardware, improving the efficiency of
ground-based exoplanet detection. In our simulations, we explore the behavior
of the Frazin Algorithm (FA) and the dependence of its convergence to an
accurate estimate on factors such as Strehl ratio, NCPA strength, and number of
algorithm search basis functions. We then apply this knowledge to simulate
running the algorithm in real-time in a nearly ideal setting. We then discuss
adaptations that can be made to the algorithm to improve its real-time
performance, and show their efficacy in simulation. A final simulation tests
the technique's resilience against imperfect knowledge of the AO residual
phase, motivating an analysis of the feasibility of using this technique in a

computational complexity and the accuracy of the estimated quasi-static NCPA

drift of Si/SiO$_2$ single electron devices (SEDs) with and without an overall
poly-Si top gate. We find that SEDs with a poly-Si top gate have significantly
less charge offset drift, exhibiting fewer isolated jumps and a factor of two
reduction in fluctuations about a stable mean value. The observed reduction can
be accounted for by the electrostatic reduction in the mutual capacitance $C_m$
between defects and the quantum dot, and increase in the total defect
capacitance $C_d$ due to the top gate. These results depart from the accepted
understanding that the level of charge offset drift in SEDs is determined by
the intrinsic material properties, forcing consideration of the device design
as well. We expect these results to be of importance in developing SEDs for
applications from quantum information to metrology or wherever charge noise or
integrability of devices is a challenge.

foreseeable that IoT systems will soon be available for commercial markets,
such as in people's homes. In this paper, we present a deployment study using
sensors attached to household objects to capture the resourcefulness of three
individuals. The concept of resourcefulness highlights the ability of humans to
repurpose objects spontaneously for a different use case than was initially
intended. It is a crucial element for human health and wellbeing, which is of
great interest for various aspects of HCI and design research. Traditionally,
resourcefulness is captured through ethnographic practice. Ethnography can only
provide sparse and often short duration observations of human experience, often
relying on participants being aware of and remembering behaviours or thoughts
they need to report on. Our hypothesis is that resourcefulness can also be
captured through continuously monitoring objects being used in everyday life.
We developed a system that can record object movement continuously and deployed
them in homes of three elderly people for over two weeks. We explored the use
of probabilistic topic models to analyze the collected data and identify common
patterns.

represent a promising platform for a broad range of novel technologies, such as
spintronic applications or topological quantum computation. However,
experimental studies into the nature and the orientation of the SOI vector in
these wires remain limited despite being of upmost importance. Typical devices
feature the nanowires placed on top of a substrate which modifies the SOI
vector and spoils the intrinsic symmetries of the system. In this work, we
report experimental results on suspended InAs nanowires, in which the wire
symmetries are fully preserved and clearly visible in transport measurements.
Using a vectorial magnet, the non-trivial evolution of weak anti-localization
(WAL) is tracked through all 3D space, and both the spin-orbit length $l_{SO}$
and coherence length $l_\varphi$ are determined as a function of the magnetic
field magnitude and direction. Studying the angular maps of the WAL signal, we
demonstrate that the average SOI within the nanowire is isotropic and that our
findings are consistent with a semiclassical quasi-1D model of WAL adapted to
include the geometrical constraints of the nanostructure. Moreover, by acting
on properly designed side gates, we apply an external electric field
introducing an additional vectorial Rashba spin-orbit component whose strength
can be controlled by external means. These results give important hints on the
intrinsic nature of suspended nanowire and can be interesting for in the field
of spintronics as well as for the manipulation of Majorana bound states in

  single-algorithm multi-model strategy to account for uncertainty in
  suitability predictions",,,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aim: The Akaike information Criterion (AIC) is widely used science to make
predictions about complex phenomena based on an entire set of models weighted
by Akaike weights. This approach (AIC model averaging; hereafter AvgAICc) is
often preferable than alternatives based on the selection of a single model.
Surprisingly, AvgAICc has not yet been introduced in ecological niche modeling
(ENM). We aimed to introduce AvgAICc in the context of ENM to serve both as an
optimality criterion in analyses that tune-up model parameters and as a
multi-model prediction strategy.
  Innovation: Results from the AvgAICc approach differed from those of
alternative approaches with respect to model complexity, contribution of
environmental variables, and predicted amount and geographic location of
suitable conditions for the focal species. Two theoretical properties of the
AvgAICc approach might justify that future studies will prefer its use over
alternative approaches: (1) it is not limited to make predictions based on a
single model, but it also uses secondary models that might have important
predictive power absent in a given single model favored by alternative
optimality criteria; (2) it balances goodness of fit and model accuracy, this
being of critical importance in applications of ENM that require model
transference.
  Main conclusions: Our introduction of the AvgAICc approach in ENM; its
theoretical properties, which are expected to confer advantages over
alternatives approaches; and the differences we found when comparing the
AvgAICc approach with alternative ones; should eventually lead to a wider use
of the AvgAICc approach. Our work should also promote further methodological
research comparing properties of the AvgAICc approach with respect to those of
alternative procedures.

Pa$\beta$ and Pa$\gamma$) of 25 starburst galaxies at 0.5<z<0.9, with average
star formation rates (SFR) x7 above the Main Sequence (MS). We find that
Paschen-to-Balmer line ratios saturate around a constant value corresponding to
$A_{\rm V}\sim$2-3 mag, while line to IR luminosity ratios suggest a large
range of more extreme obscurations and appear to be uncorrelated to the former.
This behavior is not consistent with standard attenuation laws derived for
local and distant galaxies, while being remarkably consistent with observations
of starburst cores in which young stars and dust are homogeneously mixed. This
model implies $A_{\rm V}=$2-30 mag attenuation to the center of starburst
cores, with a median of ~9 mag (a factor of 4000). X-ray hardness ratios for 6
AGNs in our sample and column densities derived from observed dust masses and
radio sizes independently confirm this level of attenuation. In these
conditions observed optical/near-IR emission comes from surface regions, while
inner starburst cores are invisible. We thus attribute the high [NII]/H$\alpha$
ratios to widespread shocks from accretion, turbulence and dynamic disturbances
rather than to AGNs. The large range of optical depths demonstrates that
substantial diversity is present within the starburst population, possibly
connected to different merger phases or progenitor properties. The majority of
our targets are, in fact, morphologically classified as mergers. We argue that
the extreme obscuration provides in itself smoking gun evidence of their merger
origin, and a powerful tool for identifying mergers at even higher redshifts.

applications requires real-time reporting of fresh status information of
underlying physical processes. In this paper, a real-time IoT monitoring system
is considered, in which the IoT devices sample a physical process with a
sampling cost and send the status packet to a given destination with an
updating cost. This joint status sampling and updating process is designed to
minimize the average age of information (AoI) at the destination node under an
average energy cost constraint at each device. This is formulated as an
infinite horizon average cost constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and
transformed into an unconstrained MDP using a Lagrangian method. For the single
IoT device case, the optimal policy for the CMDP is shown to be a randomized
mixture of two deterministic policies for the unconstrained MDP, which is of
threshold type. Then, a structure-aware optimal algorithm to obtain the optimal
policy of the CMDP is proposed and the impact of the wireless channel dynamics
is studied while demonstrating that channels having a larger mean channel gain
and less scattering can achieve better AoI performance. For the case of
multiple IoT devices, a low-complexity distributed suboptimal policy is
proposed with the updating control at the destination and the sampling control
at each device. Then, an online learning algorithm is developed to obtain this
policy, which can be implemented at each IoT device and requires only the local
knowledge and small signaling from the destination. The proposed learning
algorithm is shown to converge almost surely to the suboptimal policy.
Simulation results show the structural properties of the optimal policy for the
single IoT device case; and show that the proposed policy for multiple IoT
devices outperforms a zero-wait baseline policy, with average AoI reductions
reaching up to 33%.

black holes. This led to the conjecture that black holes are the fastest
scramblers of information, and that they scramble it in time order M log M,
where M is the mass of the black hole in natural units. As stated above, the
conjecture is not completely defined, as there are several possible definitions
of scrambling times. It appears that not all papers that refer to this
conjecture interpret it the same way. We consider a definition of scrambling
time stronger than the one given in the paper that first proposed this
conjecture [Sekino and Susskind, JHEP 0810:065 (2008)], and show that this
stronger version of the conjecture appears to be incompatible with a number of
other widely-believed and reasonable-sounding properties of black holes.
  We argue that for the scrambling time of a black hole to be this fast, either
relativity is violated or non-standard physics must be occurring outside the
stretched event horizon of a black hole. More specifically, either information
is being transferred faster than relativity would permit, the information is
not carried by the Hawking radiation and thus must be carried by unknown
physics, or the Hawking radiation carries much more information than standard
thermodynamics would permit.

develop a trilateral weighted sparse coding (TWSC) scheme for robust real-world

statistics of realistic noise and image priors. TWSC can be reformulated as a
linear equality-constrained problem and can be solved by the alternating

studied for entangled, disperse melts using a coarse-grained model for

propose a framework for the implementation of quantum constraints based on the
idea of work protocols, which are dynamically engineered to enforce the
constraints. As a proof of principle, we consider the dynamical mean-field
approach of the many-body quantum spherical model, which takes the form of a
quantum harmonic oscillator plus constraints on the first and second moments of
one of its quadratures. The constraints of the model are implemented by the
combination of two work protocols, coupling together the first and second

equations of motion in a highly nontrivial way, inducing nonlinear behavior and
even classical chaos. Interestingly, Gaussianity is preserved at all times. A
discussion concerning the robustness of this approach to possible experimental

Magnetically-Assisted Slip Casting (MASC) technique with the well-established
process of Templated Grain Growth (TGG). MASC enables the local control over
the orientation of platelets dispersed among smaller isotropic particles. After
a high temperature pressure-less treatment, the grains of the final ceramic
follow the same orientation of the initial platelets. This combination allows
us to produce 95 % dense alumina part with a grain orientation following any
deliberate orientation. We successfully fabricated microstructures inspired
from biological materials with ceramics that present periodically varying
patterns with a programmable pitch of a few tens of microns. We confirmed the
capacity of the process to tailor local mechanical properties through local
grains orientation using micro-indentation. This micrometer scale control over
the local mechanical properties could be applied to adapt ceramic structures to
complex loads using this inexpensive and scalable process. In systems where
functional properties also depend on anisotropic grain orientation, the
principle presented here could enable the creation of new multifunctional

with bifurcation (two instability branches with different frequencies) or

equations in a full 3D system, coupled with equations of density and parallel
velocity moments for the energetic particles as well as the geodesic acoustic

the bifurcation case are ballooning modes driven at the plasma pedestal, while
the instability branch with higher frequencies are low n (n<4) Toroidal Alfven
Eigenmodes nearby the pedestal. The reverse shear region between the middle and
plasma periphery in the non-bifurcated case avoids the excitation of ballooning
modes at the pedestal, although Toroidal Alfven Eigenmodes and Reverse Shear
Alfven Eigenmodes are unstable in the reverse shear region. The n=1 and n=2
Alfven Eigenmode activity can be suppressed or minimized if the neutral beam
injector (NBI) intensity is lower than the experimental value (betaf < 0.03).
In addition, if the beam energy or neutral beam injector voltage is lower than
in the experiment (Vth,f / VA0 < 0.2), the resonance between beam and thermal
plasma is weaker. The n=3,4,5 and 6 AE activity can't be fully suppressed,

Here, we investigate a spin-1 Hamiltonian on the square lattice which could,
potentially, host the spin liquid analog of the (bosonic) non-Abelian
Moore-Read FQH state, as suggested by Exact Diagonalisation of small clusters.
Using families of fully SU(2)-spin symmetric and translationally invariant
chiral Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), variational energy optimization
is performed using infinite-PEPS methods, providing good agreement with Density
Matrix Renormalisation Group (DMRG) results. A careful analysis of the bulk

suggests that they exhibit long-range ""gossamer tails"". We argue these tails
are finite-$D$ artifacts of the chiral PEPS, which become irrelevant when the
PEPS bond dimension $D$ is increased. From the investigation of the
entanglement spectrum, we observe sharply defined chiral edge modes following
the prediction of the SU(2)$_2$ Wess-Zumino-Witten theory and exhibiting a
conformal field theory (CFT) central charge $c=3/2$, as expected for a

this problem is to augment the state vector to include the states of all the

filter (ASKF). In this paper, we propose a novel decoupled Kalman filtering
algorithm. The decoupled Kalman filtering first processes each target in a
separate branch, namely the single-target Kalman filtering branch, where the
single-target states and the sensor biases are estimated. Then the bias
estimate is refined by fusing the former bias estimates across all the
single-target Kalman filtering branches. Finally, the refined bias estimate is
fed back to each single-target Kalman filtering branch to improve the target
state estimation. We prove that the proposed decoupled Kalman filtering is
exactly equivalent to the ASKF in terms of the estimation results under a usual
initial condition. The equivalence is also confirmed via the numerical example.
Moreover, we further validate the proposed algorithm using the field
experimental data of a multistatic passive radar.

connect string theory to cosmology and phenomenology is how to distinguish
effective field theories belonging to the string landscape from those that are
not consistent with a quantum theory of gravity at high energies (the ""string
swampland""). It was recently proposed that potentials of the string landscape
must satisfy at least two conditions, the ""swampland criteria"", that severely
restrict the types of cosmological dynamics they can sustain. The first
criterion states that the (multi-field) effective field theory description is
only valid over a field displacement $\Delta \phi \leq \Delta \sim \mathcal
O(1)$ (in units where the Planck mass is 1), measured as a distance in the
target space geometry. A second, more recent, criterion asserts that, whenever
the potential $V$ is positive, its slope must be bounded from below, and
suggests $|\nabla V| / V \geq c \sim \mathcal O(1)$. A recent analysis
concluded that these two conditions taken together practically rule out
slow-roll models of inflation. In this note we show that the two conditions
rule out inflationary backgrounds that follow geodesic trajectories in field
space, but not those following curved, non-geodesic, trajectories (which are
parametrized by a non-vanishing bending rate $\Omega$ of the multi-field
trajectory). We derive a universal lower bound on $\Omega$ (relative to the
Hubble parameter $H$) as a function of $\Delta, c$ and the number of efolds
$N_e$, assumed to be at least of order 60. If later studies confirm $c$ and
$\Delta$ to be strictly $\mathcal O(1)$, the bound implies strong turns with
$\Omega / H \geq 3 N_e \sim 180$. Slow-roll inflation in the landscape is not
ruled out, but it is strongly multi-field.

crystal at the droplet interface and the chirality. While for low shear rate
and weak interface anchoring the system shows a non-Newtonian behavior, a
Newtonian-like response is observed at high shear rate and strong interface
anchoring. This is investigated both by estimating the secondary flow profile,

dynamics which alter significantly the rheological response of the system.

generates life-like samples of channel impulse responses (CIRs) that

channel impairments and variations for adaptive antenna algorithms or channel
state feedback, channel models should implement spatial consistency which
ensures correlated channel responses over short time and distance epochs. The
ability to incorporate spatial consistency into channel simulators will be
essential to explore the ability to train and deploy massive multiple-input and

different from that of the photosphere. Low first ionization potential (FIP)
elements are enhanced by factors of several. A similar effect is seen in the
atmospheres of some solar-like stars, while late type M stars show an inverse
FIP effect. This inverse effect was recently detected on the Sun during solar
flares, potentially allowing a very detailed look at the spatial and temporal
behavior that is not possible from stellar observations. A key question for
interpreting these measurements is whether both effects act solely on low FIP

inverse FIP effect arises because high FIP elements are enhanced. Here we
develop a new diagnostic that can discriminate between the two scenarios, based
on modeling of the radiated power loss, and applying the models to a numerical
hydrodynamic simulation of coronal loop cooling. We show that when low/high FIP
elements are depleted/enhanced, there is a significant difference in the
cooling lifetime of loops that is greatest at lower temperatures. We apply this
diagnostic to a post X1.8 flare loop arcade and inverse FIP region, and show
that for this event, low FIP elements are depleted. We discuss the results in

source domain to one in the target domain, without requiring corresponding

recent works, such as Cycle-GAN, demands this mapping to be invertible. While,
this requirement demonstrates promising results when the domains are unimodal,
its performance is unpredictable in a multi-modal scenario such as in an image
segmentation task. This is because, invertibility does not necessarily enforce
semantic correctness. To this end, we present a semantically-consistent GAN
framework, dubbed Sem-GAN, in which the semantics are defined by the class
identities of image segments in the source domain as produced by a semantic
segmentation algorithm. Our proposed framework includes consistency constraints
on the translation task that, together with the GAN loss and the
cycle-constraints, enforces that the images when translated will inherit the
appearances of the target domain, while (approximately) maintaining their
identities from the source domain. We present experiments on several
image-to-image translation tasks and demonstrate that Sem-GAN improves the

enabled the development of methods to predict the probability of generation by
V(D)J recombination of T- and B-cell receptors of any specific nucleotide
sequence. These generation probabilities are very non-homogeneous, ranging over
20 orders of magnitude in real repertoires. Since the function of a receptor
really depends on its protein sequence, it is important to be able to predict
this probability of generation at the amino acid level. However, brute-force
summation over all the nucleotide sequences with the correct amino acid
translation is computationally intractable. The purpose of this paper is to
present a solution to this problem.
  Results: We use dynamic programming to construct an efficient and flexible
algorithm, called OLGA (Optimized Likelihood estimate of immunoGlobulin
Amino-acid sequences), for calculating the probability of generating a given
CDR3 amino acid sequence or motif, with or without V/J restriction, as a result
of V(D)J recombination in B or T cells. We apply it to databases of
epitope-specific T-cell receptors to evaluate the probability that a typical
human subject will possess T cells responsive to specific disease-associated
epitopes. The model prediction shows an excellent agreement with published
data. We suggest that OLGA may be a useful tool to guide vaccine design.

present a new method, simultaneous coherent structure coloring (sCSC), which
accomplishes the task of unsupervised clustering without a priori guidance
regarding the underlying structure of the data. sCSC performs a sequence of
binary splittings on the dataset such that the most dissimilar data points are
required to be in separate clusters. To achieve this, we obtain a set of
orthogonal coordinates along which dissimilarity in the dataset is maximized
from a generalized eigenvalue problem based on the pairwise dissimilarity
between the data points to be clustered. This sequence of bifurcations produces
a binary tree representation of the system, from which the number of clusters
in the data and their interrelationships naturally emerge. To illustrate the
effectiveness of the method in the absence of a priori assumptions, we apply it
to three exemplary problems in fluid dynamics. Then, we illustrate its capacity
for interpretability using a high-dimensional protein folding simulation
dataset. While we restrict our examples to dynamical physical systems in this

interpretability of the present method, or in which the underlying processes

optimization problems, such as Max-Cut, community detection and group

polynomial time, generic convex solvers do not scale well with the dimension of
the problem. In order to address this issue, Burer and Monteiro proposed to
reduce the dimension of the problem by appealing to a low-rank factorization
and solve the subsequent non-convex problem instead. In this paper, we present
coordinate ascent based methods to solve this non-convex problem with provable
convergence guarantees. More specifically, we prove that the block-coordinate
maximization algorithm applied to the non-convex Burer-Monteiro method globally
converges to a first-order stationary point with a sublinear rate without any
assumptions on the problem. We further show that this algorithm converges
linearly around a local maximum provided that the objective function exhibits
quadratic decay. We establish that this condition generically holds when the
rank of the factorization is sufficiently large. Furthermore, incorporating
Lanczos method to the block-coordinate maximization, we propose an algorithm
that is guaranteed to return a solution that provides $1-O(1/r)$ approximation
to the original SDP without any assumptions, where $r$ is the rank of the
factorization. This approximation ratio is known to be optimal (up to
constants) under the unique games conjecture, and we can explicitly quantify
the number of iterations to obtain such a solution.

approximate the laws of ""max statistics"" in high-dimensional problems. A
leading example of such a statistic is the coordinate-wise maximum of a sample
average of $n$ random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^p$. Existing results for this
statistic show that the bootstrap can work when $n\ll p$, and rates of
approximation (in Kolmogorov distance) have been obtained with only logarithmic
dependence in $p$. Nevertheless, one of the challenging aspects of this setting
is that established rates tend to scale like $n^{-1/6}$ as a function of $n$.
  The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that improvement in rate is
possible when extra model structure is available. Specifically, we show that if
the coordinate-wise variances of the observations exhibit decay, then a nearly
$n^{-1/2}$ rate can be achieved, independent of $p$. Furthermore, a surprising
aspect of this dimension-free rate is that it holds even when the decay is very
weak. Lastly, we provide examples showing how these ideas can be applied to
inference problems dealing with functional and multinomial data.

atmospheric radiative transfer modelling code VSTAR (Versatile Software for
Transfer of Atmospheric Radiation). Using a vector discrete-ordinate radiative
transfer code we are able to generate maps of radiance and polarization across
the disc of a planet, and integrate over these to get the full-disc
polarization. In this way we are able to obtain disc-resolved, phase-resolved
and spectrally-resolved intensity and polarization for any of the wide range of
atmopsheres that can be modelled with VSTAR. We have tested the code by
reproducing a standard benchmark problem, as well as by comparing with classic
calculations of the polarization phase curves of Venus. We apply the code to
modelling the polarization phase curves of the hot Jupiter system HD 189733b.
We find that the highest polarization amplitudes are produced with optically
thick Rayleigh scattering clouds and these would result in a polarization
amplitude of 27 ppm for the planetary signal seen in the combined light of the
star and planet. A more realistic cloud model consistent with the observed
transmission spectrum results is an amplitude of ~20 ppm. Decreasing the
optical depth of the cloud, or making the cloud particles more absorbing, both
have the effect of increasing the polarization of the reflected light but
reducing the amount of reflected light and hence the observed polarization
amplitude.

dynamics of complex sequential information. However, the structures of existing
RNN neurons mainly focus on controlling the contributions of current and
historical information but do not explore the different importance levels of
different elements in an input vector of a time slot. We propose adding a
simple yet effective Element-wiseAttention Gate (EleAttG) to an RNN block
(e.g., all RNN neurons in a network layer) that empowers the RNN neurons to
have the attentiveness capability. For an RNN block, an EleAttG is added to
adaptively modulate the input by assigning different levels of importance,
i.e., attention, to each element/dimension of the input. We refer to an RNN
block equipped with an EleAttG as an EleAtt-RNN block. Specifically, the
modulation of the input is content adaptive and is performed at fine
granularity, being element-wise rather than input-wise. The proposed EleAttG,
as an additional fundamental unit, is general and can be applied to any RNN
structures, e.g., standard RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
EleAtt-RNN by applying it to the action recognition tasks on both 3D human

is a very challenging problem since the direct extension of state-of-the-art
white-box attacks (e.g., CW or PGD) to the hard-label black-box setting will
require minimizing a non-continuous step function, which is combinatorial and
cannot be solved by a gradient-based optimizer. The only current approach is
based on random walk on the boundary, which requires lots of queries and lacks
convergence guarantees. We propose a novel way to formulate the hard-label

continuous and can be solved by any zeroth order optimization algorithm. For
example, using the Randomized Gradient-Free method, we are able to bound the

during 2014 - 2015. Our study makes use of multi-wavelength archival data
accessed through Open Universe tools and includes a new analysis of Fermi-LAT
data. We find that PKS 0502+049 contaminates the $\gamma$-ray emission region
at low energies but TXS 0506+056 dominates the sky above a few GeV. TXS
0506+056, which is a very strong (top percent) radio and $\gamma$-ray source,
is in a high $\gamma$-ray state during the neutrino alert but in a low though
hard $\gamma$-ray state in coincidence with the neutrino flare. Both states can
be reconciled with the energy associated with the neutrino emission and, in
particular during the low/hard state, there is evidence that TXS 0506+056 has
undergone a hadronic flare with very important implications for blazar
modelling. All multi-messenger diagnostics reported here support a single
coherent picture in which TXS 0506+056, a very high energy $\gamma$-ray blazar,
is the only counterpart of all the neutrino emissions in the region and
therefore the most plausible first non-stellar neutrino and, hence, cosmic ray
source.

matter halo of the Milky Way, where they are observed with velocities in excess
of the Galactic escape speed. Because of their quasi-radial trajectories, they
represent a unique probe of the still poorly constrained dark matter component
of the Galactic potential. In this paper, we present a new method to produce
such constraints. Our likelihood is based on the local HVS density obtained by
back-propagating the observed phase space position and quantifies the ejection
probability along the orbit. To showcase our method, we apply it to simulated
Gaia samples of $\sim200$ stars in three realistic Galactic potentials with
dark matter components parametrized by spheroidal NFW profiles. We find that
individual HVSs exhibit a degeneracy in the scale mass-scale radius plane
($M_s-r_s$) and are able to measure only the combination $\alpha = M_s/r_s^2$.
Likewise, a degeneracy is also present between $\alpha$ and the spheroidal
axis-ratio $q$. In the absence of observational errors, we show the whole
sample can nail down both parameters with {\it sub-per cent} precision (about
$1\%$ and $0.1\%$ for $\alpha$ and $q$ respectively) with no systematic bias.
This remarkable power to constrain deviations from a symmetric halo is a
consequence of the Galactocentric origin of HVSs. To compare our results with
other probes, we break the degeneracy in the scale parameters and impose a
mass-concentration relation. The result is a competitive precision on the
virial mass $M_{200}$ of about $10\%$.

serving a much smaller number of users. This leads to large gains in spectral
and energy efficiency compared with other technologies. As the number of
antennas M grows, the performance of such systems gets limited by pilot
contamination interference. Large Scale Fading Precoding/Postcoding (LSFP) was
proposed in literature for mitigation of pilot contamination. It was shown
recently that in channels without spatial correlation (uncorrelated base
station antennas) LSFP leads to large spectral-efficiency gains. Also,
recently, it was observed that if a channel has spatial correlation, then one
can use this correlation to drastically reduce the pilot contamination
interference in the asymptotic regime as M tends to infinity. In this work, we
analyze the performance of Uplink (UL) transmission of massive MIMO systems
with finitely many antennas M for channels with spatial correlation. We extend
the idea of LSFP to correlated channel models and derive SINR expressions that
depend only on slow fading channel components for such systems with and without
LSFP. These simple expressions lead us to simple algorithms for transmit power
optimization. As a result, we obtain a multi-fold increase in data transmission

in time domain, extend the equilibrium phase transitions to
far-from-equilibrium situations. It has been predicted that DPTs can be
precisely identified by the discontinuities of the Pancharatnam geometric phase
(PGP) during the time evolution. However, PGP always mixes with dynamical phase
and the experimental observation of DPTs by PGP is still absent. Here, we
theoretically present a novel scheme for eliminating the dynamical phase by
taking advantage of chiral symmetry in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model,
and experimentally observe DPTs by directly measuring PGP in a quenched
topological nanomechanical lattice. Time-dependent topological structures of
the SSH model are configured by eight strong-coupled high-quality-factor
nanomechanical oscillators. By measuring the vibration phase and the normalized
amplitude of the edge oscillator, we show a direct classical analog of DPTs.
Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the robustness of DPTs against weak
structure disorders, and numerically explore the relation between DPTs and the
equilibrium phase boundary. This work not only establishes the quantitative
method to identify DPTs, but also opens the door for studying non-equilibrium
topological dynamics with a well-controlled nanomechanical system.

similarly to the other young objects with age 600 Myrs, displays not only an
extended MS Turn-Off (eMSTO), as observed in intermediate-age clusters (age~1-2
Gyrs), but also a split MS. The most straightforward interpretation of the
double MS is the presence of two stellar populations: a sequence of
slowly-rotating stars lying on the blue-MS and a sequence of fast rotators,
with rotation close to the breaking speed, defining a red-MS. We report the
first direct spectroscopic measurements of projected rotational velocities
vsini for the double MS, eMSTO and Be stars of a young cluster. The analysis of
line profiles includes non-LTE effects, required for correctly deriving v sini
values. Our results suggest that: (i) the mean rotation for blue- and red-MS
stars is vsini=71\pm10 km/s (sigma=37 km/s) and vsini=202\pm23 km/s (sigma=91
km/s), respectively; (ii) eMSTO stars have different vsini, which are generally
lower than those inferred for red-MS stars, and (iii) as expected, Be stars
display the highest vsini values. This analyis supports the idea that distinct
rotational velocities play an important role in the appearence of multiple
stellar populations in the color-magnitude diagrams of young clusters, and
poses new constraints to the current scenarios.

and an extrinsic inequality, which instead relates the former to the

quantum chromodynamics and the NRQCD framework for hard, heavy-quarkonium
exclusive processes. The cross sections measured at the $B$-factories Belle and
Babar at $\sqrt{s}=10.6$ GeV disagree with the pQCD leading-order predictions
by an order of magnitude. The predictions at next-to-leading order are,
however, very sensitive to the choice of the renormalization scale, resulting
in an apparent discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and the data. We
show that this discrepancy can in fact be eliminated by applying the Principle
of Maximum Conformality (PMC) to set the renormalization scale. ... By
carefully applying the PMC to different topologies of the annihilation process,
one achieves precise pQCD predictions, together with improved perturbative
convergence. We also observe that the single-photon-fragmentation QED
correction is important, an effect which increases the total cross-section by
about $10\%$. The scale-fixed, scheme-independent cross-section predicted by
the PMC is $\sigma_{\rm tot}|_{\rm PMC}=20.35 ^{+3.5}_{-3.8}$ fb, where the
uncertainties come from the squared average of the errors due to the value of
the charm mass and the uncertainty from the quarkonium wavefunctions at the
origin. We find that the typical momentum flow of the process is $2.30$ GeV,
which explains the guessed choice of $2-3$ GeV using conventional
scale-setting. The scale-fixed $e^+ e^- \to J/\psi+\eta_c$ cross-section
predicted by the PMC shows excellent agreement with the Belle and Babar
measurements, emphasizing the importance of a rigorous renormalization
scale-setting procedure.

the second component (the mouse) changes when the components meet. We obtain
new results for two generalisations of the model. Firstly, in the 2-dimensional

find a limiting law for the last component.

assign a numerical invariant, for any balanced big Cohen-Macaulay module,
called $\uh$-length. Among other results, it is proved that, for a given
balanced big Cohen-Macaulay $R$-module $M$ with an $\m$-primary cohomological
annihilator, if there is a bound on the $\uh$-length of all modules appearing
in $\CM$-support of $M$, then it is fully decomposable, i.e. it is a direct sum
of finitely generated modules. While the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture fails
in general by a counterexample of Dieterich dealing with multiplicities to
measure the size of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules, our formalism establishes
the validity of the conjecture for complete Cohen-Macaulay local rings. In
addition, the pure-semisimplicity of a subcategory of balanced big
Cohen-Macaulay modules is settled. Namely, it is shown that $R$ is of finite
$\CM$-type if and only if the category of all fully decomposable balanced big
Cohen-Macaulay modules is closed under kernels of epimorphisms. Finally, we
examine the mentioned results in the context of Cohen-Macaulay artin algebras
admitting a dualizing bimodule $\omega$, as defined by Auslander and Reiten. It
will turn out that, $\omega$-Gorenstein projective modules with bounded
$\CM$-support are fully decomposable. In particular, a Cohen-Macaulay algebra
$\Lambda$ is of finite $\CM$-type if and only if every $\omega$-Gorenstein
projective module is of finite $\CM$-type, which generalizes a result of Chen
for Gorenstein algebras. Our main tool in the proof of results is
Gabriel-Roiter (co)measure, an invariant assigned to modules of finite length,
and defined by Gabriel and Ringel. This, in fact, provides an application of
the Gabriel-Roiter (co)measure in the category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay

Matter (DM). We focus on two different models where the scalar field couples
linearly or quadratically to the standard model of matter fields. For both
these cases, we derive the solutions of the scalar field. We also derive from
first principles the expressions for two types of observables: (i) the local
comparison of two atomic sensors that are differently sensitive to the
constants of Nature and (ii) the local differential acceleration between two
test-masses with different compositions. For the linear coupling, we recover
that the signatures induced by DM on both observables are the sum of harmonic
and Yukawa terms. For the quadratic coupling on the other hand, the signatures
derived for both types of observables turn out to be a sum of a time
independent term and of an harmonic oscillation, whose amplitudes both depend
on the position. Such a behavior is new and can make experiments in space more
sensitive than terrestrial ones. Besides, the observables present some
interesting non-linear behaviors that are due to the amplification or to the
screening of the scalar-field, depending on the parameters of the theory, and
on the compactness of the source of the gravitational field. Finally, we infer
the various limits on the DM coupling parameters by using existing frequency
comparisons on the one hand and tests of the universality of free fall on the
ground (torsion balances) or in space (MICROSCOPE mission) on the other hand.
We show that in the quadratic case, so-called natural parameters are still

For example, computing the first k principal components of the reduced set will
return approximately the first k principal components of the original set or
computing the centers of a k-means clustering on the reduced set will return an
approximation for the original set. Such a reduced set is also known as a
coreset. The main new feature of our construction is that the cardinality of
the reduced set is independent of the dimension d of the input space and that
the sets are mergable. The latter property means that the union of two reduced
sets is a reduced set for the union of the two original sets (this property has
recently also been called composability, see Indyk et. al., PODS 2014). It
allows us to turn our methods into streaming or distributed algorithms using
standard approaches. For problems such as k-means and subspace approximation
the coreset sizes are also independent of the number of input points. Our
method is based on projecting the points on a low dimensional subspace and
reducing the cardinality of the points inside this subspace using known
methods. The proposed approach works for a wide range of data analysis
techniques including k-means clustering, principal component analysis and
subspace clustering. The main conceptual contribution is a new coreset
definition that allows to charge costs that appear for every solution to an

present XMMPZCAT, a catalogue of photometric redshifts (photo-z) for 3XMM

Galactic plane in the SDSS and Pan-STARRS surveys, with the addition of near-
(NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) data whenever possible (2MASS, UKIDSS, VISTA-VHS,
and AllWISE). We used this photometry data set in combination with a training
sample of 5157 X-ray selected sources and the MLZ-TPZ package, a supervised
machine learning algorithm based on decision trees and random forests for the
calculation of photo-z. We have estimated photo-z for 100,178 X-ray sources,
about 50% of the total number of 3XMM sources (205,380) in the XMM-Newton
fields selected to build this catalogue (4208 out of 9159). The accuracy of our
results highly depends on the available photometric data, with a rate of
outliers ranging from 4% for sources with data in the optical+NIR+MIR, up to
$\sim$40% for sources with only optical data. We also addressed the reliability
level of our results by studying the shape of the photo-z probability density

NuSTAR, and X-shooter data with Fermi observations and numerical models to
constrain the blazar's particle acceleration processes and multimessenger
(electromagnetic and high-energy neutrino) emissions. Accounting properly for
electromagnetic cascades in the emission region, we find a
physically-consistent picture only within a hybrid leptonic scenario, with
gamma-rays produced by external inverse-Compton processes and high-energy
neutrinos via a radiatively-subdominant hadronic component. We derive robust
constraints on the blazar's neutrino and cosmic-ray emissions and demonstrate
that, because of cascade effects, the 0.1-100keV emissions of TXS 0506+056
serve as a better probe of its hadronic acceleration and high-energy neutrino
production processes than its GeV-TeV emissions. If the IceCube neutrino
association holds, physical conditions in the TXS 0506+056 jet must be close to
optimal for high-energy neutrino production, and are not favorable for
ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray acceleration. Alternatively, the challenges we
identify in generating a significant rate of IceCube neutrino detections from
TXS 0506+056 may disfavor single-zone models. In concert with continued
operations of the high-energy neutrino observatories, we advocate regular X-ray
monitoring of TXS 0506+056 and other blazars in order to test single-zone
blazar emission models, clarify the nature and extent of their hadronic

families of compositions ABC and AB2C, usually referred to as half- and
full-Heusler compounds, respectively. Given their tunable electronic
properties, made possible by adjusting the chemical composition, these
materials are currently considered for the possible use in sustainable
technologies such as solar energy and thermoelectric conversion. According to
theoretical predictions, Sb substitution in the TiFe2Sn full-Heusler compound
is thought to yield band structure modifications that should enhance the
thermoelectric power factor. In this work we tested the phase stability and the
structural and microstructural properties of such heavily-doped compounds. We
synthesized polycrystalline TiFe2Sn1-xSbx samples (x=0,0.1,0.2 and 1.0) by arc
melting, followed annealing. The structural characterization, performed by
x-ray powder diffraction and microscopy analyses, confirmed the formation of
the Heusler AB2C structure (cF16, Fm-3m, prototype: MnCu2Al) in all samples,
with only few percent amounts of secondary phases and only slight deviations
from nominal stoichiometry. With increasing Sb substitution we found a steady
decrease of the lattice parameter, confirming that the replacement takes place
at the Sn site. Quite unusually, the as cast samples exhibited a higher lattice
contraction than the annealed ones. The fully substituted x=1.0 compound, again
adopting the MnCu2Al structure, does not form as stoichiometric phase and
turned out to be strongly Fe deficient.The physical behavior at room
temperature indicated that annealing with increasing temperature is beneficial
for electrical and thermoelectrical transport. Moreover, we measured a slight
improvement of electrical and thermoelectrical properties in the x=0.1 sample
and a suppression in the x=0.2 sample, as compared to the undoped x=0 sample.

only an infinitely repulsive NJL interaction switches off the condensation
completely. When $N_f$ changes so that the IR fixed point falls below one (the

interaction. In the conformal window, the running of $\gamma$ to a non-trivial
IR fixed point is similar to walking dynamics, although chiral symmetry
breaking is not triggered. In the ""Ideal Walking"" scenario, chiral symmetry is
broken in that IR conformal regime by the NJL interaction, but the change in
$\gamma$ enhances the UV condensate. That enhancement of the condensate is
shown in an analytic model with a sharp change in $\gamma$ and we show
equivalent numerical results for the case of the two loop running. In the model
the $\sigma$ becomes massless as the gauge theory running becomes near

interpolating between shortest-path and random-walk routing in a network, in

this constrained RSP problem using Lagrangian duality. Second, it derives a
surprisingly simple iterative procedure to compute the optimal, randomized,
routing policy generalizing the previously developed ""soft"" Bellman-Ford

exploration in an optimal way by interpolating between a pure random behavior
and the deterministic, optimal, policy (least-cost paths) while satisfying the
constraints. Finally, the two algorithms are applied to Markov decision
problems by considering the process as a constrained RSP on a bipartite
state-action graph. In this context, the derived ""soft"" value iteration
algorithm appears to be closely related to dynamic policy programming as well
as Kullback-Leibler and path integral control, and similar to a recently
introduced reinforcement learning exploration strategy. This shows that this
strategy is optimal in the RSP sense - it minimizes expected path cost subject
to relative entropy constraint. Simulation results on illustrative examples
show that the model behaves as expected.

this approach is that in each case $G/P$ is the homogeneous model for a
parabolic geometry; the theory of such geometries provides a large supply of
geometric tools and invariant differential operators that can be used for this
study. A classical theorem of J.~Wolf shows that any involutive automorphism of
a semisimple Lie group $G$ with fixed point group $H$ gives rise to a large
family of such compactifications of homogeneous spaces of $H$. Most examples of
(classical) Riemannian symmetric spaces as well as many non--symmetric examples
arise in this way. A specific feature of the approach is that any
compactification of that type comes with the notion of ""curved analog"" to which
the tools we develop also apply. The model example of this is a general
Poincar\'e--Einstein manifold forming the curved analog of the conformal

  over Networks",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In sensor networks, it is not always practical to set up a fusion center.
Therefore, there is need for fully decentralized clustering algorithms.
Decentralized clustering algorithms should minimize the amount of data
exchanged between sensors in order to reduce sensor energy consumption. In this
respect, we propose one centralized and one decentralized clustering algorithm
that work on compressed data without prior knowledge of the number of clusters.
In the standard K-means clustering algorithm, the number of clusters is
estimated by repeating the algorithm several times, which dramatically
increases the amount of exchanged data, while our algorithm can estimate this
number in one run.
  The proposed clustering algorithms derive from a theoretical framework
establishing that, under asymptotic conditions, the cluster centroids are the
only fixed-point of a cost function we introduce. This cost function depends on
a weight function which we choose as the p-value of a Wald hypothesis test.
This p-value measures the plausibility that a given measurement vector belongs
to a given cluster. Experimental results show that our two algorithms are
competitive in terms of clustering performance with respect to K-means and
DB-Scan, while lowering by a factor at least $2$ the amount of data exchanged
between sensors.

achieve this by relating second moments of relative phase fluctuations which
are measured at different evolution times through known dynamical equations
arising from unitary non-interacting multi-mode dynamics. Applying methods from
signal processing we reconstruct the full matrix of second moments, including
the relative density fluctuations. We employ the method to investigate
equilibrium states, the dynamics of phonon occupation numbers and even to
predict recurrences. The method opens a new window for quantum simulations with
one-dimensional superfluids, enabling a deeper analysis of their equilibration

oscillation (LFO), and the flow-field around a NACA-0012 aerofoil at $Re_c =
5\times 10^4$ and $M_{\infty} = 0.4$. In the range of the investigated angles
of attack, statistics of the flow-field suggest the existence of three distinct
angle-of-attack regimes: 1) the flow and aerodynamic characteristics are not
much affected by the LFO for angles of attack $\alpha < 9.25^{\circ}$; 2) the
flow-field undergoes a transition regime in which the bubble bursting and
reformation cycle, LFO, develops until it reaches a quasi-periodic switching
between separated and attached flow in the range of angles of attack
$9.25^{\circ} \leq \alpha \leq 9.6^{\circ}$; and 3) for the angles of attack
$\alpha > 9.6^{\circ}$, the flow-field and the aerodynamic characteristics are
overwhelmed by a quasi-periodic and self-sustained LFO until the aerofoil
approaches the angle of full stall. A trailing-edge bubble (TEB) forms at
$\alpha > 9.25^{\circ}$ and grows with the angle of attack. The LSB and TEB
merge and continue to deform until they form an open bubble at $\alpha =
10.5^{\circ}$. On the suction surface of the aerofoil, the pressure
distribution shows that the presence of the LSB induces a gradual and continues
adverse pressure gradient (APG) when the flow is attached. The bursting of the
bubble causes a gradual and continues favourable pressure gradient (FPG) when
the flow is separated. This is indicative that a natural forcing mechanism
keeps the flow attached against the APG and separated despite the FPG. The
present investigation suggests that most of the observations reported in the
literature about the LSB and its associated LFO are neither thresholds nor
indicators for the inception of the instability, but rather are consequences of
it.

affects the wavefront sensor response decreasing its sensitivity. On the other
hand, wavefront sensors are generally calibrated in diffraction limited
condition, and, so, the interaction matrix sensitivity differs from the closed
loop one. The ratio between the two sensitivities, that we will call the
sensitivity loss factor, has to be estimated to retrieve a well-calibrated
measurement. The spots size measurement could give a good estimation, but it is
limited to systems with spots well sampled and uniform across the pupil. We

relevant field theory Feynman diagrams which naturally give rise to both
elastic and inelastic processes. We show that in the case analysed the leading

computations mentioned above, we also present a novel method for computing the
amplitudes contributing to the leading and subleading eikonal phases, which, in
the large $b$ limit, only involves knowledge of the onshell three and
four-point vertices. The two methods are shown to give the same results.
Furthermore we derive these results in yet another way, by computing various
one-point amplitudes which allow us to extract the classical solution of the
gravitational back reaction of the target D$p$-branes. Finally we show how our
expressions for the leading and subleading eikonal agree with the calculation

the mixture reduces to a simple Markov jump process, these features are
removed, and the distributions coincide with that of given by Neuts

measured the galaxy recession velocities for a sample of 10 maser disk systems
using a combination of spatially resolved HI disk modeling, spatially
integrated HI profile fitting, and optical spectral line and continuum fitting.
In comparing the SMBH velocities to those of their host galaxies, we find two
(out of 10) systems -- J0437+2456 and NGC 6264 -- for which the SMBH and galaxy
velocities show a statistically significant ($>$3$\sigma$) difference. For NGC
6264 the apparent velocity offset can likely be explained by ionized gas motion
within the host galaxy (e.g., from AGN-driven shocks). The velocity

on the tensor ranks and the order in which they are contracted. Unfortunately,
computing optimal contraction sequences (orderings) in general is known to be a
computationally difficult (NP-complete) task. In 2005, Markov and Shi showed
that optimal contraction sequences correspond to optimal (minimum width) tree
decompositions of a tensor network's line graph, relating the contraction
sequence problem to a rich literature in structural graph theory. While
treewidth-based methods have largely been ignored in favor of dataset-specific
algorithms in the prior tensor networks literature, we demonstrate their
practical relevance for problems arising from two distinct methods used in
quantum simulation: multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA)
datasets and quantum circuits generated by the quantum approximate optimization
algorithm (QAOA). We exhibit multiple regimes where treewidth-based algorithms
outperform domain-specific algorithms, while demonstrating that the optimal
choice of algorithm has a complex dependence on the network density, expected
contraction complexity, and user run time requirements. We further provide an

  We are the first to thoroughly explore a large space of formal secure
compilation criteria based on robust property preservation, i.e., the
preservation of properties satisfied against arbitrary adversarial contexts. We
study robustly preserving various classes of trace properties such as safety,
of hyperproperties such as noninterference, and of relational hyperproperties
such as trace equivalence. This leads to many new secure compilation criteria,
some of which are easier to practically achieve and prove than full
abstraction, and some of which provide strictly stronger security guarantees.
For each of the studied criteria we propose an equivalent ""property-free""
characterization that clarifies which proof techniques apply. For relational
properties and hyperproperties, which relate the behaviors of multiple
programs, our formal definitions of the property classes themselves are novel.
We order our criteria by their relative strength and show several collapses and
separation results. Finally, we adapt existing proof techniques to show that
even the strongest of our secure compilation criteria, the robust preservation

times each cluster is represented. During subsequent global optimization
searches, accumulated structure-energy relations of relaxed structural

each cluster of local feature vectors and demanding the sum of local energies
to amount to the structural energies in the least squares sense. The usefulness
of the method is demonstrated in basin hopping searches for 19-atom structures

binaries known, with a 96\,min orbital period. The pulsar mass function
suggests a very low-mass companion, similar to that seen in so-called ""black
widow"" binaries. Unlike in most of those, however, no radio eclipses by
material driven off from the companion were seen leading to the possibility
that the companion was a degenerate remnant of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. We
report the discovery of the optical counterpart of its companion in images
taken with the Gemini North and Keck~I telescopes. The companion varies between
$r=25$ and $r=23$ on the 96\,min orbital period of the binary, caused by
irradiation from the pulsar's energetic wind. We modeled the multi-color
lightcurve using parallax constraints from pulsar timing and determine a
companion mass of $(1.71\pm0.23)\times 10^{-2}\,M_\odot$, a radius of
$(7.6\pm1.4)\times 10^{-2}\,R_\odot$, and a mean density of $54\pm26\,{\rm

makes the companion to PSR J0636+5128 one of the densest of the ""black widow""

perhaps due to an origin in an ultra-compact X-ray binary.

tree, along a random walk. Our deterministic algorithm MOVE-HALF does not
directly maintain an MRU tree, but its cost is still proportional to the cost
of an MRU tree, and also matches the working set lower bound.

  Retrieval",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE)[1] provide an unsupervised
model for learning discrete representations by combining vector quantization
and autoencoders. In this paper, we study the use of VQ-VAE for representation
learning for downstream tasks, such as image retrieval. We first describe the
VQ-VAE in the context of an information-theoretic framework. We show that the
regularization term on the learned representation is determined by the size of
the embedded codebook before the training and it affects the generalization
ability of the model. As a result, we introduce a hyperparameter to balance the
strength of the vector quantizer and the reconstruction error. By tuning the
hyperparameter, the embedded bottleneck quantizer is used as a regularizer that
forces the output of the encoder to share a constrained coding space such that
learned latent features preserve the similarity relations of the data space. In
addition, we provide a search range for finding the best hyperparameter.
Finally, we incorporate the product quantization into the bottleneck stage of
VQ-VAE and propose an end-to-end unsupervised learning model for the image
retrieval task. The product quantizer has the advantage of generating
large-size codebooks. Fast retrieval can be achieved by using the lookup tables
that store the distance between any pair of sub-codewords. State-of-the-art
retrieval results are achieved by the learned codebooks.

fluctuations due to axion-like fields can dominate over those associated with
the electron-positron fields. Considering the framework of
axion-electrodynamics, the self-energy operator for the electromagnetic field
is determined with an accuracy to second-order in the axion-diphoton coupling.
This outcome is utilized for establishing modifications to the propagation
characteristics of photons and to the Coulomb potential of a static pointlike
charge. Notably, in the magnetosphere of a neutron star, the effect of photon
capture by the magnetic field, known in QED as relating to gamma-quanta, is
extended in axion electrodynamics to include X-ray photons with the result that
a specially polarized part of the heat radiation from the surface is canalized
along the magnetic field. Besides, for field strengths larger than the critical
scale associated with this theory, the modified Coulomb potential is of
Yukawa-type in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field at distances
much smaller than the Compton wavelength of an axion, while along the field it
follows approximately the Coulomb law at any length scale. We find that at
unlimitedly large magnetic fields the longstanding problem -- overcome in QED
-- that the ground-state energy of a hydrogen atom is unbounded from below, is
reinstated. However, in axion-electrodynamics this unboundedness is cut off
because the largest magnetic field treatable within this theory is limited by
the unitarity of the associated scattering matrix.

theoretical and practical insights on how to optimally set the interference

study possible differences between the deuteration of C- and N-bearing species.
We observed the main species $c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$, the singly and doubly
deuterated species $c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}HD}$ and $c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}D_{2}}$, as
well as the isotopologue $c$-$\mathrm{{H^{13}CC_{2}H}}$ toward 10 starless
cores and 5 protostars in the Taurus and Perseus Complexes. We examined the
correlation between the
$N$($c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}HD}$)/$N$($c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$) ratio and the dust
temperature along with the $\mathrm{H_2}$ column density and the CO depletion
factor. The resulting
$N$($c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}HD}$)/$N$($c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$) ratio is within the
error bars consistent with $10\%$ in all starless cores with detected
$c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}HD}$. This also accounts for the protostars except for the
source HH211, where we measure a high deuteration level of $23\%$. The
deuteration of $\mathrm{N_{2}H^{+}}$ follows the same trend but is considerably
higher in the dynamically evolved core L1544. Toward the protostellar cores the
coolest objects show the largest deuterium fraction in
$c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$. We show that the deuteration of
$c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$ can trace the early phases of star formation and is
comparable to that of $\mathrm{N_{2}H^{+}}$. However, the largest
$c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$ deuteration level is found toward protostellar cores,
suggesting that while $c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$ is mainly frozen onto dust
grains in the central regions of starless cores, active deuteration is taking
place on ice.

separate fields of early history of life and brought new insight into origin

life. This remote and profound relationship involves the origin and evolution
of the genetic code and the diversification and expansion of genomes. Here, a
prebiotic picture of the triplex nucleic acid evolution is proposed to explain
the origin of the genetic code, where the transition from disorder to order in
the origin of life might be due to the increasing stabilities of triplex base
pairs. The codon degeneracy can be obtained in detail based on the coevolution
of the genetic code with amino acids, or equivalently, the coevolution of tRNAs
with aaRSs. This theory is based on experimental data such as the stability of
triplex base pairs and the statistical features of genomic codon distributions.
Several experimentally testable proposals have been developed. This study

to the total matter field (cold dark matter, baryons, and non-relativistic

scale-dependent even on large scales. This effect has been usually neglected
given the sensitivity of current surveys, but becomes a severe systematic for
future surveys aiming to provide the first detection of non-zero $M_{\nu}$. The
effect can be corrected for by defining the bias with respect to the density
field of cold dark matter and baryons instead of the total matter field. In
this work, we provide a simple prescription for correctly mitigating the
neutrino-induced scale-dependent bias effect in a practical way. We clarify a
number of subtleties regarding how to properly implement this correction in the
presence of redshift-space distortions and non-linear evolution of
perturbations. We perform a MCMC analysis on simulated galaxy clustering data
that match the expected sensitivity of the \textit{Euclid} survey. We find that
the neutrino-induced scale-dependent bias can lead to important shifts in both
the inferred mean value of $M_{\nu}$, as well as its uncertainty. We show how
these shifts propagate to other cosmological parameters correlated with
$M_{\nu}$, such as the cold dark matter physical density $\Omega_{cdm} h^2$ and
the scalar spectral index $n_s$. In conclusion, we find that correctly
accounting for the neutrino-induced scale-dependent bias will be of crucial
importance for future galaxy clustering analyses. We encourage the cosmology
community to correctly account for this effect using the simple prescription we
present in our work. The tools necessary to easily correct for the
neutrino-induced scale-dependent bias will be made publicly available in an

general scenarios where several noisy PR-boxes are implemented from a single

share all the properties of conventional MZMs, such as the recently observed
$2e^2/h$ conductance quantization. From this point of view, any distinction
between such ABS zero modes and conventional MZMs becomes artificial. The key
feature that underlies their common non-trivial properties is an asymmetric
coupling of Majorana components to the reservoir, which triggers the EP

networks has drawn much attention of the computer science community and
recently that of statisticians. The unseeded version of this problem, in which
we do not know any part of the true correspondence, is a long-standing
challenge. For low-rank networks, the problem can be translated into an
unsupervised point registration problem, in which two point sets generated from
the same distribution are matchable by an unknown orthonormal transformation.
Conventional methods generally lack consistency guarantee and are usually
computationally costly.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to this problem. Instead of
simultaneously estimating the unknown correspondence and orthonormal
transformation to match up the two point sets, we match their distributions via
minimizing our designed loss function capturing the discrepancy between their
Laplace transforms, thus avoiding the optimization over all possible
correspondences. This dramatically reduces the dimension of the optimization
problem from $\Omega(n^2)$ parameters to $O(d^2)$ parameters, where $d$ is the
fixed rank, and enables convenient theoretical analysis. In this paper, we
provide arguably the first consistency guarantee and explicit error rate for
general low-rank models. Our method provides control over the computational
complexity ranging from $\omega(n)$ (any growth rate faster than $n$) to
$O(n^2)$ while pertaining consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through several numerical examples.

co-transcriptional folding. It consists of a growing chain of beads which can
form bonds with each other as they are transcribed. During the transcription
process, the $\delta$ most recently produced beads dynamically fold so as to
maximize the number of bonds formed, self-assemblying into a shape
incrementally. The parameter $\delta$ is called the delay and is related to the
transcription rate in nature.
  This article initiates the study of shape self-assembly using oritatami. A
shape is a connected set of points in the triangular lattice. We first show
that oritatami systems differ fundamentally from tile-assembly systems by
exhibiting a family of infinite shapes that can be tile-assembled but cannot be
folded by any OS. As it is NP-hard in general to determine whether there is an
OS that folds into (self-assembles) a given finite shape, we explore the
folding of upscaled versions of finite shapes. We show that any shape can be
folded from a constant size seed, at any scale n >= 3, by an OS with delay 1.
We also show that any shape can be folded at the smaller scale 2 by an OS with
unbounded delay. This leads us to investigate the influence of delay and to
prove that, for all {\delta} > 2, there are shapes that can be folded (at scale
1) with delay {\delta} but not with delay {\delta}'<{\delta}. These results
serve as a foundation for the study of shape-building in this new model of
self-assembly, and have the potential to provide better understanding of
cotranscriptional folding in biology, as well as improved abilities of

filter-out signals from off-axis directions, allowing the measurement of the
direction-dependent antenna-based gains in the visibility domain; by doing this
towards multiple directions it is possible to calibrate across wide fields of

directions are independent. We use MWA results at 88 and 154 MHz under various
weather conditions to characterise the performance and applicability of the
technique. We conclude that this method is suitable to measure and correct for
temporal fluctuations and direction-dependent spatial ionospheric phase
distortions on a wide range of scales: both larger and smaller than the array
size. The latter are the most intractable and pose a major challenge for future
instruments. Moreover this scheme is an embarrassingly parallel process, as
multiple directions can be processed independently and simultaneously. This is

sequential task, where a recommender system suggests a stream of songs that

playlist, some of the playlist models proposed so far consider the current and
previous songs in the playlist (i.e., the song context) and possibly the order
of the songs in the playlist. We investigate the impact of the song context and
the song order on next-song recommendations by conducting dedicated off-line
experiments on two datasets of hand-curated music playlists. Firstly, we
compare three playlist models, each able to consider a different song context
length: a popularity-based model, a song-based Collaborative Filtering (CF)
model and a Recurrent-Neural-Network-based model (RNN). We also consider a
model that predicts next songs at random as a reference. Secondly, we challenge
the RNN model (the only model from the first experiment able to consider the
song order) by manipulating the order of songs within playlists. Our results
indicate that the song context has a positive impact on the quality of
next-song recommendations, even though this effect can be masked by the bias
towards very popular songs. Furthermore, in our experiments the song order does
not appear as a crucial variable to predict better next-song recommendations.

necessary for the further development of theories explicating circuit function.
Perhaps as a derivative of its initial application to abstract informational
systems, network science provides many methods and summary statistics that
address the network's topological characteristics with little or no thought to
its physical instantiation. Recent progress has capitalized on quantitative
tools from network science to parsimoniously describe and predict neural
activity and connectivity across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Yet, for
embedded systems, physical laws can directly constrain processes of network
growth, development, and function, and an appreciation of those physical laws
is therefore critical to an understanding of the system. Recent evidence
demonstrates that the constraints imposed by the physical shape of the brain,
and by the mechanical forces at play in its development, have marked effects on
the observed network topology and function. Here, we review the rules imposed
by space on the development of neural networks and show that these rules give
rise to a specific set of complex topologies. We present evidence that these
fundamental wiring rules affect the repertoire of neural dynamics that can
emerge from the system, and thereby inform our understanding of network
dysfunction in disease. We also discuss several computational tools,
mathematical models, and algorithms that have proven useful in delineating the
effects of spatial embedding on a given networked system and are important
considerations for addressing future problems in network neuroscience. Finally,
we outline several open questions regarding the network architectures that
support circuit function, the answers to which will require a thorough and
honest appraisal of the role of physical space in brain network anatomy and
physiology.

wormholes as an emerging class of traversable wormholes within the context,
this time cylindrically symmetric spacetimes are exploited to construct such
wormholes. Having established a generic formulation, first the Linet-Tian
metric generally, and then the cosmic string metric and a black string metric
in greater details are studied as constructing blocks of cylindrical asymmetric
thin-shell wormholes. The corresponding wormholes are investigated within the
linearized stability analysis framework to firstly, demonstrate that they can
exist from the mechanical stability point of view, and secondly, indicate the
correlation between the stability and symmetry in each case, if there is any at
all. From here, we have extracted a pattern for the way stability changes with
the asymmetry degree for the two examples; however, it was observed that the
symmetric state is not the most neither the less stable state. There are also
some side results: It was learned that any cylindrical thin-shell wormhole made
of two cosmic string universes cannot be supported by a barotropic equation of
state. Furthermore, as another side outcome, it was perceived that the radius
dependency of the so-called variable equation of state, which is used all over
this article, has a great impact on the mechanical stability of the cylindrical
asymmetric thin-shell wormholes studied in this brief.

possible risks to the technological infrastructure of a modern society, caused
by extreme space-weather events. The normal benchmark has been the great
geomagnetic storm of September 1859, the so-called ""Carrington Event"". However,
there are numerous records of another great geomagnetic storm in February 1872.
This storm, about 12 years after the Carrington Event, resulted in comparable
magnetic disturbances and auroral displays over large areas of the Earth. We
have revisited this great geomagnetic storm in terms of the auroral and sunspot
records in the historical documents from East Asia. In particular, we have
surveyed the auroral records from East Asia and estimated the equatorward
boundary of the auroral oval to be near 24.3 deg invariant latitude (ILAT), on
the basis that the aurora was seen near the zenith at Shanghai (20 deg magnetic
latitude, MLAT). These results confirm that this geomagnetic storm of February
1872 was as extreme as the Carrington Event, at least in terms of the
equatorward motion of the auroral oval. Indeed, our results support the
interpretation of the simultaneous auroral observations made at Bombay (10 deg
MLAT). The East Asian auroral records have indicated extreme brightness,
suggesting unusual precipitation of high-intensity, low-energy electrons during
this geomagnetic storm. We have compared the duration of the East Asian auroral
displays with magnetic observations in Bombay and found that the auroral
displays occurred in the initial phase, main phase, and early recovery phase of
the magnetic storm.

treated domestic wastewater (10%). The microalgal biomass produced in the PBRs
was harvested in a static lamella settling tank. Each PBR treated in average
2.3 m3/d. PBRs were submitted to strong seasonal changes regarding solar
radiation and temperature, which had a direct impact in the activity of
microalgae and the efficiency of the system. Higher mixed liquor pH values were
registered in summer (daily average> 10). Most of the influent and effluent
nitrogen content was inorganic (average of 9.0 mg N/L and 3.17 mg N/L,
respectively), and in the form of nitrate (62% and 50%, respectively). Average
nitrogen removal efficiency was 65%, with values of around 90% in summer, 80%
in autumn, 50 % in winter and 60% in spring. Most of the influent and effluent
phosphorus content was in the form of ortophosphate. Influent average was 0.62
mg P/L, but with great variations and in a considerable number of samples not
detected. Removal efficiency (when influent values were detected) was very high
during all the study, usually greater than 95%, and there were not clear
seasonal trends for efficiency as observed for TIN. Volumetric biomass
production greatly changed between seasons with much lower values in winter (7
g VSS/m3d) than in summer (43 g VSS/m3d). Biomass separation efficiency of the
settler was very good in either terms of turbidity and total suspended solids,
being most of the time lower than 5 UNT and 15 mg/L, respectively. Overall this
study demonstrated the reliable and good effectiveness of microalgae based
technologies such as the PBR to remove nutrients at a full scale size.

distribution of $e^+e^-$ pairs is studied using the quantum kinetic equation.
Two closely resembling temporal envelopes namely, Gaussian and Sauter, keeping
all the other pulse parameters the same, are considered to this end. Contrary
to the common perception which can be gauged from the interchangeable use of
these temporal profiles, the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the pairs
created by the two pulses is found to differ significantly in all the temporal
regimes. For the pulses having a few cycles of oscillations, the temporal
profile of the pulse is revealed in the oscillatory interference pattern riding
over the otherwise smooth longitudinal momentum spectrum at asymptotic times.
The onset of the oscillation due to the quantum interference of reflection
amplitudes from the scattering potential due to the pulses having a temporal
structure of multiple barriers takes place for few-cycle oscillations for the
Gaussian pulse than that for the Sauter pulse. Furthermore, the oscillation
amplitude for the same number of oscillations within the pulse duration is
larger for the Gaussian pulse. The presence of the carrier-envelope phase and
the frequency chirping is found to magnify these differences. In the absence of
any appreciable interference effect for the pulses having less than five
oscillations, the longitudinal momentum spectrum has a higher peak value for
the Sauter pulse at asymptotic times. On the hand, before the transient stage
of evolution, the peak of the spectrum shows the opposite trend.

intelligent objects which can learn and act automatically. Although AI will
bring great opportunities for mobile applications, little work has focused on

present three existing architectures of mobile intelligence in detail and
introduce its broad application prospects. Furthermore, we conduct a series of
experiments to evaluate the performance of the prevalent commercial
applications and intelligent frameworks. Our results show that there is a big
gap between Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements and the status quo. So
far, we have seen only the tip of the iceberg. We pose issues and challenges to
advance the area of mobile intelligence and hope to pave the way for the
forthcoming.

model is required to learn some group of transformations, every element of
which is well-approximated by a traditional feedforward network. Thus the group
as a whole can be represented as a hyper network. One of typical examples of
such groups is spatial transformations. We show that the proposed framework,
which we call HyperNets, is able to deal with at least two basic spatial
transformations of images: rotation and affine transformation. We show that
HyperNets are able not only to generalize rotation and affine transformation,
but also to compensate the rotation of images bringing them into canonical
forms.

multiple-output (MIMO) decode-forward (DF) relay channel with one source, one
relay, and one destination. The existing suboptimal near maximum likelihood
(NML) detector and the NML with two-level pair-wise error probability
(NMLw2PEP) detector achieve excellent performance with instantaneous channel
state information (CSI) of the source-relay (SR) link and with statistical CSI
of the SR link, respectively. However, the NML detectors require an
exponentially increasing complexity as the number of transmit antennas
increases. Using deep learning algorithms, NML-based detection networks
(NMLDNs) are proposed with and without the CSI of the SR link at the
destination. The NMLDNs detect signals in changing channels after a single
training using a large number of randomly distributed channels. The detection
networks require much lower detection complexity than the exhaustive search NML
detectors while exhibiting good performance. To evaluate the performance, we
introduce semidefinite relaxation detectors with polynomial complexity based on
the NML detectors. Additionally, new linear detectors based on the zero
gradient of the NML metrics are proposed. Applying various detection algorithms
at the relay (DetR) and detection algorithms at the destination (DetD), we
present some DetR-DetD methods in MIMO DF relay channels. An appropriate
DetR-DetD method can be employed according to the required error probability
and detection complexity. The complexity analysis and simulation results
validate the arguments of this paper.

industrial automation setting, certain areas should be off limits to an
automated vehicle for protection of people and high-valued assets. These areas
can be quarantined by mapping (e.g., GPS) or via beacons that delineate a
no-entry area. We propose a delineation method where the industrial vehicle
utilizes a LiDAR {(Light Detection and Ranging)} and a single color camera to
detect passive beacons and model-predictive control to stop the vehicle from
entering a restricted space. The beacons are standard orange traffic cones with
a highly reflective vertical pole attached. The LiDAR can readily detect these
beacons, but suffers from false positives due to other reflective surfaces such
as worker safety vests. Herein, we put forth a method for reducing false
positive detection from the LiDAR by projecting the beacons in the camera
imagery via a deep learning method and validating the detection using a neural
network-learned projection from the camera to the LiDAR space. Experimental
data collected at Mississippi State University's Center for Advanced Vehicular
Systems (CAVS) shows the effectiveness of the proposed system in keeping the
true detection while mitigating false positives.

of this method, known as control-based continuation (CBC), it is applied to a
nonlinear beam structure that exhibits a strong 3:1 modal coupling between its
first two bending modes. CBC is able to extract a range of dynamical features,
including an isola, directly from the experiment without recourse to model
fitting or other indirect data-processing methods.
  Previously, CBC has only been applied to (essentially)
single-degree-of-freedom experiments; in this paper we show that the required
feedback-control methods and path-following techniques can equally be applied
to MDOF systems. A low-level broadband excitation is initially applied to the
experiment to obtain the requisite information for controller design and,
subsequently, the physical experiment is treated as a `black box' that is
probed using CBC. The invasiveness of the controller used is analysed and
experimental results are validated with open-loop measurements. Good agreement
between open- and closed-loop results is achieved, though it is found that care
needs to be taken in dealing with the presence of higher-harmonics in the force
applied to the structure.
