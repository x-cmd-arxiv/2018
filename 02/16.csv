theory. We use constructive ordered algebra in toposes. Identity types in the
models are given by a notion of Moore path. By considering a particular gros
topos, we show that there is such a model that is non-truncated, i.e. contains
non-trivial structure at all dimensions. In other words, in this model a type
in a nested sequence of identity types can contain more than one element, no
matter how great the degree of nesting. Although inspired by existing
non-truncated models of type theory based on simplicial and cubical sets, the
notion of model presented here is notable for avoiding any form of Kan filling
condition in the semantics of types.

i.i.d. samples from each model. This is of interest for example in genomics,
where changes in the structure or edge weights of the underlying causal graphs
reflect alterations in the gene regulatory networks. We here provide the first
provably consistent method for directly estimating the differences in a pair of
causal DAGs without separately learning two possibly large and dense DAG models

tests between regression coefficients of the two data sets to estimate the

invariance tests between regression residual variances. We demonstrate the
properties of our method through a simulation study and apply it to the
analysis of gene expression data from ovarian cancer and during T-cell

Specifically, we extend gradient boosting to use piecewise linear regression

the accuracy. We also propose some optimization tricks to substantially reduce
the training time of PL Trees, with little sacrifice of accuracy. Moreover, we
propose several implementation techniques to speedup our algorithm on modern

determine what inferences, predictions, and control strategies are possible for
a given system. Parameter space reduction and parameter estimation---and, more
generally, understanding the shape of the information contained in models with
observational structure---are thus essential for many questions in mathematical
modeling and uncertainty quantification. As such, different disciplines have
developed methods in parallel for approaching the questions in their field.
Many of these approaches, including identifiability, sloppiness, and active
subspaces, use related ideas to address questions of parameter dimension
reduction, parameter estimation, and robustness of inferences and quantities of
interest.
  In this paper, we show that active subspace methods have intrinsic
connections to methods from sensitivity analysis and identifiability, and
indeed that it is possible to frame each approach in a unified framework. A
particular form of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), which we denote the
sensitivity FIM, is fundamental to all three approaches---active subspaces,
identifiability, and sloppiness. Through a series of examples and case studies,
we illustrate the properties of the sensitivity FIM in several contexts. These
initial examples show that the interplay between local and global and linear
and non-linear strongly impact the insights each approach can generate. These
observations underline that one's approach to parameter dimension reduction
should be driven by the scientific question and also open the door to using
tools from the other approaches to generate useful insights.

adversarial and multi-objective architectures proliferate. In this paper, we
develop new techniques to understand and control the dynamics in general games.
The key result is to decompose the second-order dynamics into two components.
The first is related to potential games, which reduce to gradient descent on an
implicit function; the second relates to Hamiltonian games, a new class of
games that obey a conservation law, akin to conservation laws in classical
mechanical systems. The decomposition motivates Symplectic Gradient Adjustment
(SGA), a new algorithm for finding stable fixed points in general games. Basic
experiments show SGA is competitive with recently proposed algorithms for
finding stable fixed points in GANs -- whilst at the same time being applicable

target selection need not therefore be impeded by the bottle-neck of requiring
prior follow-up observations to determine the planet mass. The decision metric
can be easily deployed within a distributed heterogeneous network of telescopes
equipped to undertake either broadband photometry or spectroscopy. We show how
the metric can be used either to optimise the observing strategy for a given
telescope (e.g. choice of filter) or to enable the selection of the best
telescope to optimise the overall sample size. Our decision metric can also
provide the basis for a selection function to help evaluate the statistical
completeness of follow-up transmission spectroscopy datasets. Finally, we
validate our metric by comparing its ranked set of targets against lists of
planets that have had their atmospheres successfully probed, and against some
existing prioritised exoplanet lists.

gravity-like inverse square distance law. Similar ""Mock Gravity"" interactions
were later introduced by Spitzer and Gamow in the context of Galaxy formation
but their actual relevance in Cosmology has never been unambiguously
established. Here we predict the existence of Mock-Gravity, inverse square
distance, attractive forces between two identical molecules or nanoparticles in
a quasi monochromatic isotropic random light field, whenever the light
frequency is tuned to an absorption line such that the real part of the
particle's electric polarizability is zero, i.e. at the so-called Froehlich
resonance. These interactions are scale independent, holding for both near and
far-field separation distances.

the machine-learning community due to their ability to elegantly and tractably
model the delicate balance between quality and diversity of sets. DPPs are
commonly learned from data using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). While
fitting observed sets well, MLE for DPPs may also assign high likelihoods to
unobserved sets that are far from the true generative distribution of the data.
To address this issue, which reduces the quality of the learned model, we
introduce a novel optimization problem, Contrastive Estimation (CE), which
encodes information about ""negative"" samples into the basic learning model. CE
is grounded in the successful use of negative information in machine-vision and
language modeling. Depending on the chosen negative distribution (which may be
static or evolve during optimization), CE assumes two different forms, which we
analyze theoretically and experimentally. We evaluate our new model on
real-world datasets; on a challenging dataset, CE learning delivers a
considerable improvement in predictive performance over a DPP learned without
using contrastive information.

when procedures relying on standard normal theory are not justifiable, for
example when data are not symmetrically distributed, contain outliers, or
responses are even measured on ordinal scales. Various specific rank-based
methods have been developed for two and more samples, and also for general
factorial designs (e.g., Kruskal-Wallis test, Jonckheere-Terpstra test). It is
the aim of the present paper (1) to demonstrate that traditional
rank-procedures for several samples or general factorial designs may lead to
paradoxical results in case of unbalanced samples, (2) to explain why this is
the case, and (3) to provide a way to overcome these disadvantages of
traditional rankbased inference. Theoretical investigations show that the
paradoxical results can be explained by carefully considering the
non-centralities of the test statistics which may be non-zero for the
traditional tests in unbalanced designs. These non-centralities may even become
arbitrarily large for increasing sample sizes in the unbalanced case. A simple
solution is the use of socalled pseudo-ranks instead of ranks. As a special
case, we illustrate the effects in sub-group analyses which are often used when
dealing with rare diseases.

calculating the minimal surfaces of the corresponding probing open string

stress and pressures outside of the host. These pressures may cause pathogen
pathovars to diverge in their environmental persistence and their infectivity
on an evolutionary time-scale. On a shorter time-scale, a single-genotype
pathogen population may display wide variation in persistence times and exhibit
biphasic decay. Using an infectious disease transmission modeling framework, we
demonstrate in both cases that fitness-preserving trade-offs have implications
for the dynamics of associated epidemics: less infectious, more persistent
pathogens cause epidemics to progress more slowly than more infectious, less
persistent (labile) pathogens, even when the overall risk is the same. Using
identifiability analysis, we show that the usual disease surveillance data does
not sufficiently inform these underlying pathogen population dynamics, even
with basic environmental monitoring. These results suggest directions for
future microbial research and environmental monitoring. In particular,
determining the relative infectivity of persistent pathogen subpopulations and
the rates of phenotypic conversion will help ascertain how much disease risk is
associated with the long tails of biphasic decay. Alternatively, risk can be
indirectly ascertained by developing methods to separately monitor labile and
persistent subpopulations. A better understanding of persistence--infectivity
trade-offs and associated dynamics can improve risk assessment and disease

incorporate 3D spatial information from adjacent slices. Based on the transfer
learning from 2D to 3D, the 3D network converges faster and achieves a better
denoising performance than that trained from scratch. By comparing the CPCE
with recently published methods based on the simulated Mayo dataset and the

characterized by intra-band carrier scattering in relatively rigid bands,
leading to a non-thermal intermediate state with separate thermal distributions
of electrons and holes. This behavior can be viewed as typical for a band
insulator with weak interactions. For larger interaction, on the other hand, we
observe a strong modification of the electronic spectrum and a filling-in of
the gap after photo-excitation, along with a rapid thermalization of the
system. The two behaviors therefore provide a dynamical distinction of a
correlated band insulator and a band-insulator, which can differ even when the
spectra of the two systems are similar in equilibrium. The crossover happens
when the interaction $U$ is comparable to $\Delta$.

evolution and breaking of a large amplitude relativistically intense electron
plasma wave has been studied, using a 1-D relativistic Particle-in-Cell (PIC)
code. We have found that for phase velocities for which $\gamma _\phi \ll 1 +
\frac{k_BT_e}{mc^2}$, the wave damps within a few plasma period and essentially
follows the relativistic Landau Damping rate predicted by Buti. In the opposite
regime (i.e. for $\gamma _\phi \gg 1 + \frac{k_BT_e}{mc^2}$) we have observed
that waves propagate through the system for a long period of time and in small
amplitude limit follow the relativistic warm plasma dispersion relation.
Further we have demonstrated that in the same regime (i.e. for $\gamma _\phi
\gg 1 + \frac{k_BT_e}{mc^2}$), for the phase velocities less than the velocity
of light $c$, like the cold plasma Akhiezer - Polovin wave, in a warm plasma
also, relativistically intense waves break via phase mixing when perturbed by
an arbitrarily small amplitude longitudinal perturbation. Using the simulation
results, we have also shown that the phase mixing time scale in a warm plasma
can be interpreted using Dawson's formula for phase mixing time for a
non-relativistic cold inhomogeneous plasma, which is based on out of phase
motion of neighbouring oscillators constituting the wave.

investigated. Then, the problem of the global representation of a fingerprint's

similarity between integral curves of smooth vector fields and flow streamline
patterns is eye-catching, the case of an oriented texture like a fingerprint's
stream of ridges proved to be a hard problem since, on the one hand, not all
fingerprint singularities and nearby orientational behaviour can be modelled by
canonical phase portraits on the plane, and on the other hand, even if it were
the case, this should lead to a perplexing geometrical problem of connecting
local phase portraits, a question which will be formulated within
Poincar\'{e}'s index theory and addressed via a normal form approach as a
bivariate Hermite interpolation problem. To a certain extent, the material
presented herein is self-contained and provides a baseline for future work
where, starting from a normal form as a source image, a transport via large
deformation flows is envisaged to match the fingerprint as a target image.

the current are applied parallel to each other.Our experimental studies on the
resistive behavior of a superconducting Mo$_{0.79}$Ge$_{0.21}$ nanostrip reveal
the emergence of a dissipative state with increasing magnetic field, followed
by a pronounced resistance drop, signifying a reentrance to the superconducting

indicate that the intermediate resistive state is due to an unwinding of
twisted vortices. When the magnetic field increases, this instability is
suppressed due to a better accommodation of the vortex lattice to the pinning

very near to the star surface and the height of this primary shock do not vary
much with either the spin period or the Bernoulli parameter of the flow,
although the strength of the shock may vary with the period. For moderately
rotating central star there are possible formation of multiple sonic points in
the flow and therefore, a second shock far away from the star surface may also
form. However, the second shock is much weaker than the primary one near the

precisely track the DW position along magnetic nanowire. We also quantify the
DW transient inertial displacement due to its acceleration and deceleration by
pulse current and the entailed spin and charge pumping. Finally, TD-NEGF+LLG as

between these two extremes: some details of the system mechanics are known but
not enough for creating simulations that can be used to make high quality
predictions. In this context we propose using approximate simulations to build
a kernel for use in kernelized machine learning methods, such as support vector
machines. The results of multiple simulations (under various uncertainty
scenarios) are used to compute similarity measures between every pair of
samples: sample pairs are given a high similarity score if they behave
similarly under a wide range of simulation parameters. These similarity values,
rather than the original high dimensional feature data, are used to build the
kernel.
  Results: We demonstrate and explore the simulation based kernel (SimKern)
concept using four synthetic complex systems--three biologically inspired
models and one network flow optimization model. We show that, when the number
of training samples is small compared to the number of features, the SimKern
approach dominates over no-prior-knowledge methods. This approach should be
applicable in all disciplines where predictive models are sought and
informative yet approximate simulations are available.

the text classification problem in this real-world multidomain setting (MDTC).
We provide theoretical justifications for the MAN framework, proving that
different instances of MANs are essentially minimizers of various f-divergence

are thus a theoretically sound generalization of traditional adversarial
networks that discriminate over two distributions. More specifically, for the
MDTC task, MAN learns features that are invariant across multiple domains by
resorting to its ability to reduce the divergence among the feature
distributions of each domain. We present experimental results showing that MANs
significantly outperform the prior art on the MDTC task. We also show that MANs
achieve state-of-the-art performance for domains with no labeled data.

The TCC method combines the single-reference coupled-cluster (CC) approach with
an approximate reference calculation in a subspace [complete active space

one-particle spectral gap assumption is introduced, separating the CAS from the
remaining Hilbert space. This replaces the nonexisting or nearly nonexisting
gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital usually encountered in standard single-reference quantum
chemistry. The analysis covers, in particular, CC methods tailored by
tensor-network states (TNS-TCC methods). The problem is formulated in a
nonlinear functional analysis framework, and, under certain conditions such as
the aforementioned gap, local uniqueness and existence are proved using
Zarantonello's lemma. From the Aubin--Nitsche-duality method, a quadratic error
bound valid for TNS-TCC methods is derived, e.g., for linear-tensor-network TCC

photons, leaving a measurable imprint on CIB maps. The resulting statistical
anisotropy can be used to reconstruct the matter distribution out to the
redshifts of CIB sources. To this end, we generalize the CMB lensing quadratic
estimator to any weakly non-Gaussian source field, by deriving the optimal
lensing weights. We point out the additional noise and bias caused by the
non-Gaussianity and the `self-lensing' of the source field. We propose methods
to reduce, subtract or model these non-Gaussianities. We show that CIB lensing
should be detectable with Planck data, and detectable at high significance for
future CMB experiments like CCAT-Prime. The CIB thus constitutes a new source
image for lensing studies, providing constraints on the amplitude of structure
at intermediate redshifts between galaxies and the CMB. CIB lensing
measurements will also give valuable information on the star formation history
in the universe, constraining CIB halo models beyond the CIB power spectrum. By
laying out a detailed treatment of lens reconstruction from a weakly
non-Gaussian source field, this work constitutes a stepping stone towards lens

will be a key ingredient for future quantum technologies that rely on
light-matter interfaces. We demonstrate that traveling-wave ""ring"" cavities can
achieve a greatly reduced mode waist $w$, leading to larger atom-cavity
coupling strength, relative to conventional standing-wave cavities for given
mirror separation and stability. Additionally, ring cavities can achieve
arbitrary transverse-mode spacing simultaneously with the large mode-waist
reductions. Following these principles, we build a parabolic atom-ring cavity
system that achieves strong collective coupling $NC = 15(1)$ between $N=10^3$
Rb atoms and a ring cavity with a single-atom cooperativity $C$ that is a
factor of $35(5)$ times greater than what could be achieved with a
near-confocal standing-wave cavity with the same mirror separation and finesse.
By using parabolic mirrors, we eliminate astigmatism--which can otherwise
preclude stable operation--and increase optical access to the atoms. Cavities
based on these principles, with enhanced coupling and large mirror separation,
will be particularly useful for achieving strong coupling with ions, Rydberg
atoms, or other strongly interacting particles, which often have undesirable
interactions with nearby surfaces.

infinite dimensions is a nontrivial task: we tackle it here by using a modified
diamond norm, suitable to quantify the distinguishability of channels in
infinite dimensions. We prove two theorems that bound the emergence of

Calzetti-like attenuation law (assuming a dust temperature of T = 40-50 K). We
find a physical offset of 3 kpc between the dust continuum emission and the
rest-frame UV light probed by Hubble Space Telescope imaging for galaxy ID65666

website with a search option via a SQL query and an online tool to re-calculate
the distance/reddening of a nova from the derived reddening-distance relations.
Using the novae in the catalogue, the existence of a maximum magnitude-rate of
decline (MMRD) relation in the Galaxy is investigated. Although an MMRD
relation was obtained, a significant scattering in the resulting MMRD
distribution still exists. We suggest that the MMRD relation likely depends on
other parameters in addition to the decline time, as FWHM H$_\alpha$, the light
curve shapes. Using two different samples depending on the distances in the

Galactic novae as a function of their spectral and speed classes were studied.

for the local outburst density are 3.6 and 4.2 $\times 10^{-10}$ pc$^{-3}$

studied both experimentally and theoretically. The absorption coefficients
pertaining to the plasma medium were obtained for different power measurements.
The results indicate that absorption coefficients decrease with the increase in
laser power. The UV-Vis spectra of mercury plasma were recorded by the
charge-coupled spectrometer device at different power levels of laser. The
linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of plasma spectra reveals the plasma ion and
electron oscillations. Fourier series modeling of electron oscillation results
the Whistler mode frequency of wpe= 0.16 kHz with a density of ne=3.9x1013
cm^(-3). 3D representation of LDA coefficients shows that the increase of laser
power leads the plasma species to form in Whistler mode structures. Plasma
electron temperatures ( e T ) was inferred from the SPARTAN non-local thermal
equilibrium (non-LTE) spectral code, and they were about 0.6 eV in the absence
of laser light. However, there was a 0.05 eV increase in electron temperature
when the laser power was absorbed by the plasma. Electron temperatures slightly
increased with the increase in the power levels, which in turn resulted in

attention for robot navigation in pedestrian crowds. In this paper, we present
empirical study of pedestrian-robot interaction in an uni-directional exit
corridor. We deploy a mobile robot moving in a direction perpendicular to that
of the pedestrian flow, and install a pedestrian motion tracking system to
record the collective motion. We analyze both individual and collective motion
of pedestrians, and measure the effect of the robot motion on the overall
pedestrian flow. The experimental results show the effect of passive HRI, where
the pedestrians' overall speed is slowed down in the presence of the robot, and
the faster the robot moves, the lower the average pedestrian velocity becomes.
Experiment results show qualitative consistency of the collective HRI effect
with simulation results that was previously reported. The study can be used to
guide future design of robot-assisted pedestrian evacuation algorithms.

This work presents a technique called IBeaconMap for creating such topological

of the indoor spaces of interest. IBeaconMap employs a combination of computer
vision and machine learning techniques to arrive at the required set of beacon

indicates that dynamical instabilities in planetary systems are common. These
instabilities can alter the orbits of gas giants as well as the orbits of
terrestrial planets and therefore eject or move a habitable planet out of the
habitable zone. In this work 423 simulations with 153 different hypothetical
planetary systems with gas giants and terrestrial planets have been modelled to
explore the orbital stability of habitable planets. The initial parameter
variations include the number, distances and masses of the giant planets and
the star type. Linear correlations between the initial number and the initial
distances of gas giants and the survival rate of habitable planets were found.
Planetary systems consisting of two giant planets are fairly benign to
terrestrial planets, whereas six giant planets very often lead to a complete
clearing of the habitable zone. Systems with initial distances of five Hill
Radii between the giant planets have a high chance to harbour a habitable
planet, although more compact systems are very destructive. The giant planet
masses have a smaller impact on the stability of habitable worlds.
Additionally, a link between the present-day orbit of an observed giant
exoplanet and the survival rate of habitable planets was established. As a rule
of thumb, observed gas giants with eccentricities higher than 0.4 and
inclinations higher than 20 degrees have experienced strong planet-planet
scatterings and are unlikely to have a habitable planet in its system.
Furthermore, it was found that habitable planets surrounding a K or M-star have
a higher survival rate than those surrounding a G-star.

first gravitational event GW150914 was discovered by the Advanced Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (AdLIGO). For all evolutionary
channels based on the evolution of isolated binaries, the immediate progenitor
of the binary black hole is a close binary system composed of a black hole and
a helium star. We perform detailed binary evolution and systematically explore
the parameter space of initial binary properties, including initial black hole
and helium star masses, initial rotation of the helium star as well as
metallicity. We argue that the spin of the first-born black hole at its birth
is negligible ($\lesssim 0.1$), hence the second-born black hole's spin
dominates the measured effective spin, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, from gravitational
wave events of double black hole mergers. We find that tides can be important
only when orbital periods are shorter than 2 days. Upon core collapse, the
helium star produces a black hole (the second-born black hole in the system)
with a spin that can span the entire range from zero to maximally spinning. We
show that the bimodal distribution of the spin of the second-born black hole
obtained in recent papers is mainly due to oversimplifying assumptions. We find
an anti-correlation between the merging timescale of the two black holes,
T$_{\rm merger}$, and the effective spin $\chi_{\rm eff}$. Finally, we provide
new prescriptions for the tidal coefficient E$_2$ for both H-rich and the
helium-rich stars. We predict that, with future improvements to AdLIGO's
sensitivity, the sample of merging binary black hole systems will show an
overdensity of sources with positive but small $\chi_{\rm eff}$. originating

membranes. In these systems, domains of the liquid-condensed phase always
present size polydispersity. However, very few theoretical works consider size
distribution effects on the monolayer properties. Because of the difference in
surface densities, domains have excess dipolar density with respect to the
surrounding liquid expanded phase, originating a dipolar inter-domain
interaction. This interaction depends on the domain area, and hence the
presence of a domain size distribution is associated with interaction
polydispersity. Inter-domain interactions are fundamental to understanding the
structure and dynamics of the monolayer. For this reason, it is expected that
polydispersity significantly alters monolayer properties. By means of Brownian
dynamics simulations, we study the radial distribution function (RDF), the
average mean square displacement and the average time-dependent self-diffusion
coefficient, D(t), of lipid monolayers with normal distributed size domains. It
was found that polydispersity strongly affects the value of the interaction
strength obtained, which is greatly underestimated if polydispersity is not
considered. However, within a certain range of parameters, the RDF obtained
from a polydisperse model can be well approximated by that of a monodisperse
model, suitably fitting the interaction strength, even for 40%
polydispersities. For small interaction strengths or small polydispersities,
the polydisperse systems obtained from fitting the experimental RDF have an
average mean square displacement and D(t) in good agreement with that of the
monodisperse system.

low-luminosity ($M_{\rm 1450} > -25$) quasars at $z \gtrsim 6$ discovered by
the Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC) survey. The [CII] line and FIR continuum
luminosities lie in the ranges $L_{\rm [CII]} = (3.8-10.2) \times 10^8~L_\odot$
and $L_{\rm FIR} = (1.2-2.0) \times 10^{11}~L_\odot$, which are at least one
order of magnitude smaller than those of optically-luminous quasars at $z

$\simeq 23-40~M_\odot ~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. Their line and continuum-emitting
regions are marginally resolved, and found to be comparable in size to those of
optically luminous quasars, indicating that their SFR or likely gas mass
surface densities (key controlling parameter of mass accretion) are accordingly
different. The $L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\rm FIR}$ ratios of the hosts, $\simeq
(2.2-8.7) \times 10^{-3}$, are fully consistent with local star-forming
galaxies. Using the [CII] dynamics, we derived their dynamical masses within a
radius of 1.5-2.5 kpc as $\simeq (1.4-8.2) \times 10^{10}~M_\odot$. By
interpreting these masses as stellar ones, we suggest that these faint quasar
hosts are on or even below the star-forming main sequence at $z \sim 6$, i.e.,
they appear to be transforming into quiescent galaxies. This is in contrast to
the optically luminous quasars at those redshifts, which show starburst-like
properties. Finally, we find that the ratios of black hole mass to host galaxy
dynamical mass of the most of low-luminosity quasars including the HSC ones are
consistent with the local value. The mass ratios of the HSC quasars can be
reproduced by a semi-analytical model that assumes merger-induced black
hole-host galaxy evolution.

known to depend strongly on both material and geometric design properties.
However, the relative importance and interplay of these two facets, and the
degree to which they can be used to ultimately control energy flow, remains an
open question. Recently derived bounds suggest that enhancements as large as
$|\chi|^4 \lambda^{2} / \left(\left(4\pi\right)^{2} \Im\left[\chi\right]^{2}

but neither geometries reaching this bound, nor designs revealing the predicted

inverse techniques, in combination with fast computational approaches enabled
by the low-rank properties of elliptic operators for disjoint bodies, we
investigate this relation between material and geometry on an enlarged space
structures. Crucially, we find that the material proportionality given above
does indeed emerge in realistic structures. In reaching this result, we also
show that (in two dimensions) lossy metals such as tungsten, typically
considered to be poor candidate materials for strongly enhancing heat transfer

come within $50\%$ of those exhibited by an ideal pair of resonant lossless

local neighborhoods we significantly increase the size of images the model can
process in practice, despite maintaining significantly larger receptive fields
per layer than typical convolutional neural networks. While conceptually
simple, our generative models significantly outperform the current state of the
art in image generation on ImageNet, improving the best published negative
log-likelihood on ImageNet from 3.83 to 3.77. We also present results on image
super-resolution with a large magnification ratio, applying an encoder-decoder

gas is the mostly likely cause of the low detection rate at high redshift, in
addition to finding that at z < 0.1 there may also be a decrease in the
detection rate, which we suggest is due to the dilution of the absorption
strength by 21-cm emission. By assuming that associated and intervening
absorbers have similar cosmological mass densities, we find evidence that the
spin temperature of the gas evolves with redshift, consistent with heating by
ultra-violet photons. From the near--infrared (3.4, 4.6 and 12 micron) colours,
we see that radio galaxies become more quasar-like in their activity with
increasing redshift. We also find that the non-detection of 21-cm absorption at
high redshift is not likely to be due to the selection of gas-poor ellipticals,
in addition to a strong correlation between the ionising photon rate and the
[3.4] - [4.6] colour, indicating that the UV photons arise from AGN activity.
Like previous studies, we find a correlation between the detection of 21-cm
absorption and the [4.6] - [12] colour, which is a tracer of star-forming

We restrict comparisons to Sp.T. kriging versus ordinary kriging for functional
data (OKFD), since the more flexible functional kriging approaches, pointwise
functional kriging (PWFK) and functional kriging total model, coincide with
OKFD in several situations. We contribute with new knowledge by proving that
OKFD and PWFK coincide under certain conditions. From the simulation study, it
is concluded that the prediction performance for the two kriging approaches in
general is rather equal for stationary Sp.T. processes, with a tendency for
functional kriging to work better for small sample sizes and Sp.T. kriging to
work better for large sample sizes. For non-stationary Sp.T. processes, with a
common deterministic time trend and/or time varying variances and dependence
structure, OKFD performs better than Sp.T. kriging irrespective of sample size.
For all simulated cases, the computational time for OKFD was considerably lower
compared to those for the Sp.T. kriging methods.

system security issue, we implemented a series of investigations on the
adversarial attack in this work: We first identify an image's pixel
vulnerability to the adversarial attack based on the adversarial saliency
analysis. By comparing the analyzed saliency map and the adversarial
perturbation distribution, we proposed a new evaluation scheme to
comprehensively assess the adversarial attack precision and efficiency. Then,
with a novel adversarial saliency prediction method, a fast adversarial example
generation framework, namely ""ASP"", is proposed with significant attack
efficiency improvement and dramatic computation cost reduction. Compared to the
previous methods, experiments show that ASP has at most 12 times speed-up for
adversarial example generation, 2 times lower perturbation rate, and high
attack success rate of 87% on both MNIST and Cifar10. ASP can be also well
utilized to support the data-hungry NN adversarial training. By reducing the
attack success rate as much as 90%, ASP can quickly and effectively enhance the
defense capability of NN based system to the adversarial attacks.

Direct magnetic
field strength observations have proven specifically challenging in the
extremely dynamic protostellar phase. Because of their occurrence in the
densest parts of star forming regions, masers, through polarization
observations, are the main source of magnetic field strength and morphology
measurements around protostars. Of all maser species, methanol is one of the
strongest and most abundant tracers of gas around high-mass protostellar disks
and in outflows. However, as experimental determination of the magnetic
characteristics of methanol has remained largely unsuccessful, a robust
magnetic field strength analysis of these regions could hitherto not be
performed. Here we report a quantitative theoretical model of the magnetic
properties of methanol, including the complicated hyperfine structure that
results from its internal rotation. We show that the large range in values of
the Land\'{e} g-factors of the hyperfine components of each maser line lead to
conclusions which differ substantially from the current interpretation based on
a single effective g-factor. These conclusions are more consistent with other
observations and confirm the presence of dynamically important magnetic fields
around protostars. Additionally, our calculations show that (non-linear) Zeeman
effects must be taken into account to further enhance the accuracy of

for stochasticity, a scenario-based approach is taken to address the
uncertainty in the population to be evacuated from a small town in Lombardy

algorithms on the classification of fossil teeth in the Family Bovidae.
Isolated bovid teeth are typically the most common fossils found in southern
Africa and they often constitute the basis for paleoenvironmental
reconstructions. Taxonomic identification of fossil bovid teeth, however, is
often imprecise and subjective. Using modern teeth with known taxons, machine
learning algorithms can be trained to classify fossils. Previous work by Brophy
et. al. 2014 uses elliptical Fourier analysis of the form (size and shape) of
the outline of the occlusal surface of each tooth as features in a linear
discriminant analysis framework. This manuscript expands on that previous work
by exploring how different machine learning approaches classify the teeth and
testing which technique is best for classification. Five different machine
learning techniques including linear discriminant analysis, neural networks,
nuclear penalized multinomial regression, random forests, and support vector
machines were used to estimate these models. Support vector machines and random
forests perform the best in terms of both log-loss and misclassification rate;
both of these methods are improvements over linear discriminant analysis. With
the identification and application of these superior methods, bovid teeth can
be classified with higher accuracy.

achieve the best performance, we first create a VAE platform with discrete
latent space generated by a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST dataset when compared
against similar approaches that only involve discrete variables in the
generative process. We consider QVAEs with a smaller number of latent units to
be able to perform QMC simulations, which are computationally expensive. We
show that QVAEs can be trained effectively in regimes where quantum effects are
relevant despite training via the quantum bound. Our findings open the way to
the use of quantum computers to train QVAEs to achieve competitive performance

sparse modeling, utilizing two regularization terms: the $\ell_1$-norm and a
new function named Total Squared Variation (TSV) of the brightness
distribution. TSV is an edge-smoothing variant of Total Variation (TV), leading
to reducing the sum of squared gradients. First, we demonstrate that our
technique may achieve super-resolution of $\sim 30$% compared to the
traditional CLEAN beam size using synthetic observations of two point sources.
Second, we present simulated observations of three physically motivated static
models of Sgr A* with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) to show the performance
of proposed techniques in greater detail. We find that $\ell_1$+TSV
regularization outperforms $\ell_1$+TV regularization with the popular
isotropic TV term and the Cotton-Schwab CLEAN algorithm, demonstrating that TSV
is well-matched to the expected physical properties of the astronomical images,
which are often nebulous. Remarkably, in both the image and gradient domains,
the optimal beam size minimizing root-mean-squared errors is $\lesssim 10$% of
the traditional CLEAN beam size for $\ell_1$+TSV regularization, and
non-convolved reconstructed images have smaller errors than beam-convolved
reconstructed images. This indicates that the traditional post-processing
technique of Gaussian convolution in interferometric imaging may not be
required for the $\ell_1$+TSV regularization. We also propose a feature
extraction method to detect circular features from the image of a black hole
shadow with the circle Hough transform (CHT) and use it to evaluate the
performance of the image reconstruction. With our imaging technique and the
CHT, the EHT can constrain the radius of the black hole shadow with an accuracy
of $\sim 10-20$% in present simulations for Sgr A*.

at high temperatures due to the limitation of mass transfer. It also results in
low direct-utilization of the fuel. To address the challenges of low carbon
oxidation activity and low carbon utilization simultaneously, a highly
efficient, 3-D solid-state architected anode has been developed to enhance the
performance of DCFCs below 600C. The cells with the 3-D textile anode,
Gd:CeO2-Li/Na2CO3 composite electrolyte, and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (SSC) cathode have
demonstrated excellent performance with maximum power densities of 143, 196,

be operated steadily with a rated power density of ~0.13 W cm-2 at a constant
current density of 0.15 A cm-2 with a carbon utilization over 86%. The
significant improvement of the cell performance at such temperatures attributes
to the high synergistic conduction of the composite electrolyte and the
superior 3-D anode structure which offers more paths for carbon catalytic

second, DG is zero for at least one realization of interval parameters (the so
called weakly zero DG). We characterize strongly and weakly zero DG and its
special case where the matrix of coefficients is real. We discuss computational
complexity of testing weakly and strongly zero DG for commonly used types of
interval linear programs and their variants with the real matrix of

stresses at the atomic scale in model two-dimensional Lennard-Jones glasses
produced via differing quench protocols. This technique allows us to sample the
plastic rearrangements in a non-perturbative manner for different loading
directions on a well-controlled length scale. Plastic activity upon shearing
correlates strongly with the locations of low yield stresses in the quenched
states. This correlation is higher in more structurally relaxed systems. The
distribution of local yield stresses is also shown to strongly depend on the
quench protocol: the more relaxed the glass, the higher the local plastic
thresholds. Analysis of the magnitude of local plastic relaxations reveals that
stress drops follow exponential distributions, justifying the hypothesis of an
average characteristic amplitude often conjectured in mesoscopic or continuum
models. The amplitude of the local plastic rearrangements increases on average
with the yield stress, regardless of the system preparation. The local yield
stress varies with the shear orientation tested and strongly correlates with
the plastic rearrangement locations when the system is sheared correspondingly.
It is thus argued that plastic rearrangements are the consequence of shear
transformation zones encoded in the glass structure that possess weak slip
planes along different orientations. Finally, we justify the length scale
employed in this work and extract the yield threshold statistics as a function
of the size of the probing zones. This method makes it possible to derive
physically grounded models of plasticity for amorphous materials by directly
revealing the relevant details of the shear transformation zones that mediate
this process.

might tell when a train driver is incapacitated by a medical event, and assist
in adopting a safe recovery strategy. These applications are demanding, because
they require accurate detection of rare anomalies that may be seen only at
runtime. Such a setting causes supervised methods to perform poorly. We
describe a method for detecting an anomalous face image that meets these
requirements. We construct a feature vector that reliably has large entries for
anomalous images, then use various simple unsupervised methods to score the
image based on the feature. Obvious constructions (autoencoder codes;
autoencoder residuals) are defeated by a 'peeking' behavior in autoencoders.
Our feature construction removes rectangular patches from the image, predicts
the likely content of the patch conditioned on the rest of the image using a
specially trained autoencoder, then compares the result to the image. High
scores suggest that the patch was difficult for an autoencoder to predict, and
so is likely anomalous. We demonstrate that our method can identify real
anomalous face images in pools of typical images, taken from celeb-A, that is
much larger than usual in state-of-the-art experiments. A control experiment
based on our method with another set of normal celebrity images - a 'typical

information to such a model presents a challenge due to complex training
issues, such as ""catastrophic forgetting"", and sensitivity to hyper-parameter
tuning. However, in this modern world, data is constantly evolving, and our
deep learning models are required to adapt to these changes. In this paper, we
propose an adaptive hierarchical network structure composed of DCNNs that can
grow and learn as new data becomes available. The network grows in a tree-like
fashion to accommodate new classes of data, while preserving the ability to
distinguish the previously trained classes. The network organizes the
incrementally available data into feature-driven super-classes and improves
upon existing hierarchical CNN models by adding the capability of self-growth.
The proposed hierarchical model, when compared against fine-tuning a deep
network, achieves significant reduction of training effort, while maintaining
competitive accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

We analyze linear regression estimators resulting from model-selection by
proving estimation error and linear representation bounds uniformly over sets

rates when applied to both independent and dependent data. These results are
useful in meaningfully interpreting the linear regression estimator obtained
after exploring and reducing the variables and also in justifying post

the end-to-end delay between sensing, processing and actuation. For example, in
a flight controller for a multirotor drone, the data from a gyro or inertial
sensor must be gathered and processed to determine the attitude of the
aircraft. Sensor data fusion is followed by control decisions that adjust the
flight of a drone by altering motor speeds. If the processing pipeline between
sensor input and actuation is not bounded, the drone will lose control and
possibly fail to maintain flight.
  Motivated by the implementation of a multithreaded drone flight controller on
the Quest RTOS, we develop a composable pipe model based on the system's task,
scheduling and communication abstractions. This pipe model is used to analyze
two semantics of end-to-end time: reaction time and freshness time. We also
argue that end-to-end timing properties should be factored in at the early
stage of application design. Thus, we provide a mathematical framework to
derive feasible task periods that satisfy both a given set of end-to-end timing
constraints and the schedulability requirement. We demonstrate the
applicability of our design approach by using it to port the Cleanflight flight
controller firmware to Quest on the Intel Aero board. Experiments show that
Cleanflight ported to Quest is able to achieve end-to-end latencies within the

two objects in Neptune's distant 9:1 mean motion resonance at semimajor axis
$a\approx~130$~au. Both objects are securely resonant on 10~Myr timescales,
with one securely in the 9:1 resonance's leading asymmetric libration island
and the other in either the symmetric or trailing asymmetric island. These
objects are the largest semimajor axis objects with secure resonant
classifications, and their detection in a carefully characterized survey allows
for the first robust resonance population estimate beyond 100~au. The detection
of these objects implies a 9:1 resonance population of $1.1\times10^4$ objects
with $H_r<8.66$ ($D~\gtrsim~100$~km) on similar orbits (95\% confidence range
of $\sim0.4-3\times10^4$). Integrations over 4~Gyr of an ensemble of clones
spanning these objects' orbit fit uncertainties reveal that they both have
median resonance occupation timescales of $\sim1$~Gyr. These timescales are
consistent with the hypothesis that these objects originate in the scattering
population but became transiently stuck to Neptune's 9:1 resonance within the
last $\sim1$~Gyr of solar system evolution. Based on simulations of a model of
the current scattering population, we estimate the expected resonance sticking
population in the 9:1 resonance to be 1000-4500 objects with $H_r<8.66$; this
is marginally consistent with the OSSOS 9:1 population estimate. We conclude
that resonance sticking is a plausible explanation for the observed 9:1
population, but we also discuss the possibility of a primordial 9:1 population,
which would have interesting implications for the Kuiper belt's dynamical
history.

in accurately determining the time since the nucleus switched-off. I resolve
this problem using a new approach that combines spectral ageing and dynamical
models to tightly constrain the energetics and duty-cycles of dying sources.
Fitting the shape of the integrated radio spectrum yields the fraction of the
source age the nucleus is active; this, in addition to the flux density, source
size, axis ratio, and properties of the host environment, provides a constraint
on dynamical models describing the remnant radio source. This technique is used
to derive the intrinsic properties of the well-studied remnant radio source B2

power of $3.6^{+3.0}_{-1.7}\times 10^{37}$ W, and a lobe magnetic field
strength below equipartition at the $8\sigma$ level. The integrated spectra of
restarted and intermittent radio sources is found to yield a 'steep-shallow'
shape when the previous outburst occurred within 100 Myr. The duty-cycle of B2
0924+30 is hence constrained to be $\delta < 0.15$ by fitting the shortest time
to the previous comparable outburst that does not appreciably modify the

this paper, we propose an efficient distributed stochastic optimization method

a linear speedup in the number of machines, constant memory footprint, and only
a logarithmic number of communication rounds. Critically, our approach is a
black-box reduction that parallelizes any serial online learning algorithm,
streamlining prior analysis and allowing us to leverage the significant
progress that has been made in designing adaptive algorithms. In particular, we
achieve optimal convergence rates without any prior knowledge of smoothness
parameters, yielding a more robust algorithm that reduces the need for
hyperparameter tuning. We implement our algorithm in the Spark distributed

Jaynes-Cummings or a dephasing coupling, while the coupling to the heat bath is
modeled by the quantum optical or the Caldeira-Leggett master equation
(neglecting any direct coupling between central system and heat bath). We then
provide ample numerical evidence, for both, model-independence and accuracy of
the depolarizing heat bath model. Alongside with our study, we investigate
different regimes, where the strong coupling condition leads to coherence

fundamental step. Image analysis based on superpixels facilitates
domain-specific applications, also speeding up the overall processing time of

adherence, usually regulating the size and shape of each superpixel in order to
mitigate the occurrence of undersegmentation failures. Superpixel regularity
and compactness sometimes imposes an excessive number of segments in the image,
which ultimately decreases the efficiency of the final segmentation, specially
in video segmentation. We propose here a novel method to generate superpixels,
called iterative over-segmentation via edge clustering (ISEC), which addresses
the over-segmentation problem from a different perspective in contrast to
recent state-of-the-art approaches. ISEC iteratively clusters edges extracted
from the image objects, providing adaptive superpixels in size, shape and
quantity, while preserving suitable adherence to the real object boundaries.
All this is achieved at a very low computational cost. Experiments show that
ISEC stands out from existing methods, meeting a favorable balance between
segmentation stability and accurate representation of motion discontinuities,
which are features specially suitable to video segmentation.

provide cooperative services, firstly to enhance information secrecy of
licensed users via adding intentional jamming to protect them from potential

The
accelerated expansion can be modelled by invoking a cosmological constant or a
dynamical model of dark energy. A key difference between these models is that
the equation of state parameter $w$ for dark energy differs from $-1$ in
dynamical dark energy (DDE) models. Further, the equation of state parameter is
not constant for a general DDE model. Such differences can be probed using the
variation of scale factor with time by measuring distances. Another significant
difference between the cosmological constant and DDE models is that the latter
must cluster. Linear perturbation analysis indicates that perturbations in
quintessence models of dark energy do not grow to have a significant amplitude
at small length scales. In this paper we study the response of quintessence
dark energy to non-linear perturbations in dark matter. We use a fully
relativistic model for spherically symmetric perturbations. In this study we
focus on thawing models. We find that in response to non-linear perturbations
in dark matter, dark energy perturbations grow at a faster rate than expected
in linear perturbation theory. We find that dark energy perturbation remains
localised and does not diffuse out to larger scales. The dominant drivers of
the evolution of dark energy perturbations are the local Hubble flow and a
supression of gradients of the scalar field. We also find that the equation of
state parameter $w$ changes in response to perturbations in dark matter such
that it also becomes a function of position. The variation of $w$ in space is
correlated with density contrast for matter. Variation of $w$ and perturbations
in dark energy are more pronounced in response to large scale perturbations in
matter while the dependence on the amplitude of matter perturbations is much
weaker.

constituting blocks exhibit microphase separation in the melt state. The phase
separated melt can successfully be exploited to control the morphology of the
final semi crystalline materials by allowing an extended thermal annealing.
Thermal annealing accelerates coalescence of microdomains, yielding a phase
separated melt that would exhibit a distinctly different crystallization
behaviour than microphase separated melt without annealing. In this paper, we
report simulation results on the crystallization behavior of A-B diblock
copolymer, wherein the melting temperature of A-block is higher than B-block,
instigated from microphase separated melt. During crystallization, the
morphological evolution of microphase separated melt is extensively driven by
thermal history. Annealing of microphase separated melt at high temperature
successfully reorients melt morphology, and remains almost unaltered during the
subsequent crystallization (isothermal and non-isothermal), which is attributed
to the hard confinement resulted during microphase separation. Annealing
induces a change in bond orientation of A-block, whereas there is no
appreciable change in bond orientation of B-block keeping crystallinity and
lamellar thickness unaffected. Isothermal crystallization confines
crystallization in phase separated microdomain whereas non-isothermal
crystallization results in morphological perturbation. The crystallization rate
of annealed melt is much faster than the non-annealed melt due to less
entanglement and more relaxed structure, achieved via annealing. At a higher
composition of B-block, A-block produces thicker crystals, which is attributed
to the dilution effect exhibited by B-block. Two-step compared to one-step
isothermal crystallization yields thicker crystals with higher crystallinity of
A-block.

isotropic interfacial tension, subsurface phase separation is observed,
independent of the reaction kinetics, but for strong anisotropy, phase
separation is controlled by surface reactions, as assumed in 1D models.

probable (but not the only) explanation is the tidal evolution of a close
binary within a primordial triple system (possibly after a period of
Kozai-Lidov oscillations), leading to merger approximately 1Gyr ago. This star

important tool in parameterized complexity. The input to an $n$-fold integer
program (IP) consists of parameter $A$, dimension $n$, and numerical data of
binary encoding length $L$. It was known for some time that such programs can
be solved in polynomial time using $O(n^{g(A)}L)$ arithmetic operations where
$g$ is an exponential function of the parameter. In 2013 it was shown that it
can be solved in fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) time using $O(f(A)n^3L)$
arithmetic operations for a single-exponential function $f$. This, and a faster
algorithm for a special case of combinatorial $n$-fold IP, have led to several
very recent breakthroughs in the parameterized complexity of scheduling,
stringology, and computational social choice. In 2015 it was shown that it can
be solved in strongly polynomial time using $O(n^{g(A)})$ arithmetic
operations.
  Here we establish a result which subsumes all three of the above results by
showing that $n$-fold IP can be solved in strongly polynomial FPT time using
$O(f(A)n^3)$ arithmetic operations. In fact, our results are much more general,
briefly outlined as follows.
  - There is a strongly polynomial algorithm for ILP whenever a so-called
Graver-best oracle is realizable for it.
  - Graver-best oracles for the large classes of multi-stage stochastic and
tree-fold ILPs can be realized in FPT time. Together with the previous oracle
algorithm, this newly shows two large classes of ILP to be strongly polynomial;
in contrast, only few classes of ILP were previously known to be strongly
polynomial.
  - We show that ILP is FPT parameterized by the largest coefficient
$\|A\|_\infty$ and the primal or dual treedepth of $A$, and that this
parameterization cannot be relaxed, signifying substantial progress in
understanding the parameterized complexity of ILP.

the gap between upper and lower bounds is still enormous. Specific values and
its asymptotic behavior are major and fascinating open problems in rigidity
theory. Our work considers the maximal number of real embeddings of minimally
rigid graphs in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We modify a commonly used parametric
semi-algebraic formulation that exploits the Cayley-Menger determinant to
minimize the {\em a priori} number of complex embeddings, where the parameters
correspond to edge lengths. To cope with the huge dimension of the parameter
space and find specializations of the parameters that maximize the number of
real embeddings, we introduce a method based on coupler curves that makes the
sampling feasible for spatial minimally rigid graphs.
  Our methodology results in the first full classification of the number of
real embeddings of graphs with 7 vertices in $\mathbb{R}^3$, which was the

scattered along their individual trajectory. In rare circumstances,
momentum-conserving collision events dominate, and thermal transport becomes
hydrodynamic. One of these cases, dubbed the Poiseuille flow of phonons, can
occur in a temperature window just below the peak temperature of thermal
conductivity. We report on a study of heat flow in bulk black phosphorus
between 0.1 and 80 K. We find a thermal conductivity showing a faster than
cubic temperature dependence between 5 and 12 K. Consequently, the effective
phonon mean free path shows a nonmonotonic temperature dependence at the onset
of the ballistic regime, with a size-dependent Knudsen minimum. These are
hallmarks of Poiseuille flow previously observed in a handful of solids.
Comparing the phonon dispersion in black phosphorus and silicon, we showthat
the phase space for normal scattering events in black phosphorus is much
larger. Our results imply that the most important requirement for the emergence
of Poiseuille flowis the facility ofmomentum exchange between acoustic phonon
branches. Proximity to a structural transition can be beneficial for the
emergence of this behavior in clean systems, even when they do not exceed

significant reduction in lattice thermal conductivity starts below the
temperature at which the average interdopant distance and the thermal
wavelength of acoustic phonons become comparable. In the high-temperature
regime, thermal diffusivity becomes proportional to the inverse of temperature,
with a prefactor set by sound velocity and Planckian time
($\tau_{p}=\frac{\hbar}{k_{B}T}$).

intriguing features that are consistent with CaRuO3 developing dual magnetic
character, with both a net moment as well as antiferromagnetic order. We argue
the ordered SrRuO3 layer induces an undulating polarization profile in the
conduction electrons of CaRuO3, by a mechanism akin to Friedel oscillations. At
low temperatures, this oscillating polarization is inherited by rigid local
moments within CaRuO3, leading to a robust exchange bias. We present ab initio

so close to each other that the loss of their identities becomes likely. In the
best case scenario, trajectories are interrupted, thus curbing the completeness
of the data-set; in the worse case scenario, identity switches arise,
potentially affecting in severe ways the very quality of the data. Here, we
present a novel tracking method that addresses the problem of occlusions within
large groups of featureless objects by means of three steps: i) it represents
each target as a cloud of points in 3D; ii) once a 3D cluster corresponding to
an occlusion occurs, it defines a partitioning problem by introducing a cost
function that uses both attractive and repulsive spatio-temporal proximity
links; iii) it minimizes the cost function through a semi-definite optimization
technique specifically designed to cope with link frustration. The algorithm is
independent of the specific experimental method used to collect the data. By
performing tests on public data-sets, we show that the new algorithm produces a
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art tracking methods, both by
reducing the number of identity switches and by increasing the accuracy of the
actual positions of the targets in real space.

with the z~7.5 quasar from Banados et al 2017, and also predicts only a few
quasars suitable for 21-cm forest observations (10mJy) in the sky. We exhibit a
new effect on the 21-cm signal observed against the CMB: a radio-loud quasar
can leave the imprint of its duty cycle on the 21-cm tomography. We apply this
effect in a cosmological simulation and conclude that the effect of typical
radio-loud quasars is most likely negligible in an SKA field of view. For a
1-10mJy quasar the effect is stronger though hardly observable at SKA
resolution. Then we study the contribution of the lyman band Ly-alpha to
Ly-beta) emission of quasars to the Wouthuisen-Field coupling. The collective
effect of quasars on the 21-cm power spectrum is larger than the thermal noise
at low k, though featureless. However, a distinctive pattern around the
brightest quasars in an SKA field of view may be observable in the tomography,
encoding the duration of their duty cycle. This pattern has a high
signal-to-noise ratio for the brightest quasar in a typical SKA shallow survey.

video coding technique for HEVC named Full Color Perceptual Quantization
(FCPQ). FCPQ is designed to adjust the Quantization Parameter (QP) at the CB
level (i.e., the luma CB and the chroma Cb and Cr CBs) according to the
variances of pixel data in each CB. FCPQ is based on the default perceptual
quantization method in HEVC called AdaptiveQP. AdaptiveQP adjusts the QP of an
entire CU based only on the spatial activity of the constituent luma CB. As
demonstrated in this paper, by not accounting for the spatial activity of the
constituent chroma CBs, as is the case with AdaptiveQP, coding performance can
be significantly affected; this is because the variance of pixel data in a luma
CB is notably different from the variances of pixel data in chroma Cb and Cr
CBs. FCPQ, therefore, addresses this problem. In terms of coding performance,
FCPQ achieves BD-Rate improvements of up to 39.5% (Y), 16% (Cb) and 29.9% (Cr)

  Model for Estimating Causal Structure from Mixed Continuous and Discrete Data",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating causal models from observational data is a crucial task in data
analysis. For continuous-valued data, Shimizu et al. have proposed a linear
acyclic non-Gaussian model to understand the data generating process, and have
shown that their model is identifiable when the number of data is sufficiently
large. However, situations in which continuous and discrete variables coexist
in the same problem are common in practice. Most existing causal discovery
methods either ignore the discrete data and apply a continuous-valued algorithm
or discretize all the continuous data and then apply a discrete Bayesian
network approach. These methods possibly loss important information when we
ignore discrete data or introduce the approximation error due to
discretization. In this paper, we define a novel hybrid causal model which
consists of both continuous and discrete variables. The model assumes: (1) the
value of a continuous variable is a linear function of its parent variables
plus a non-Gaussian noise, and (2) each discrete variable is a logistic
variable whose distribution parameters depend on the values of its parent
variables. In addition, we derive the BIC scoring function for model selection.
The new discovery algorithm can learn causal structures from mixed continuous
and discrete data without discretization. We empirically demonstrate the power
of our method through thorough simulations.

of face recognition systems. The performance and reliability of these models
depend heavily on the amount and quality of the training data. However, the
collection of annotated large datasets does not scale well and the control over
the quality of the data decreases with the size of the dataset. In this work,
we explore how synthetically generated data can be used to decrease the number
of real-world images needed for training deep face recognition systems. In
particular, we make use of a 3D morphable face model for the generation of
images with arbitrary amounts of facial identities and with full control over
image variations, such as pose, illumination, and background. In our
experiments with an off-the-shelf face recognition software we observe the
following phenomena: 1) The amount of real training data needed to train
competitive deep face recognition systems can be reduced significantly. 2)
Combining large-scale real-world data with synthetic data leads to an increased
performance. 3) Models trained only on synthetic data with strong variations in
pose, illumination, and background perform very well across different datasets
even without dataset adaptation. 4) The real-to-virtual performance gap can be
closed when using synthetic data for pre-training, followed by fine-tuning with
real-world images. 5) There are no observable negative effects of pre-training
with synthetic data. Thus, any face recognition system in our experiments
benefits from using synthetic face images. The synthetic data generator, as
well as all experiments, are publicly available.

carbonaceous chondrites, constitute a unique tool for deciphering the sources

micrometer-scale analyses of hydrogen isotopes in six CM-type carbonaceous
chondrites revealing a dominant deuterium-poor water component ({\delta}D =
-350 +/- 40 permil) mixed with deuterium-rich organic matter. We suggest that
this D-poor water corresponds to a ubiquitous water reservoir in the inner
protoplanetary disk. A deuterium-rich water signature has been preserved in the
least altered part of the Paris chondrite ({\delta}DParis > -69 +/- 163 permil)
in hydrated phases possibly present in the CM rock before alteration. The
presence of the D-enriched water signature in Paris might indicate that
transfers of ice from the outer to the inner Solar System have been significant
within the first million years of the Solar System history.

detection method. The presented approach makes use of an incremental
Bag-of-Words (BoW) scheme based on binary descriptors to retrieve previously
seen similar images, avoiding any vocabulary training stage usually required by
classic BoW models. In addition, to detect loop closures, iBoW-LCD builds on
the concept of dynamic islands, a simple but effective mechanism to group
similar images close in time, which reduces the computational times typically
associated to Bayesian frameworks. Our approach is validated using several
indoor and outdoor public datasets, taken under different environmental
conditions, achieving a high accuracy and outperforming other state-of-the-art
solutions.

patterns in a time series. In particular, the studied scenario assumes a
theoretical model is available that contains the expected locations of the
patterns. This problem is found in several contexts, and it is commonly solved
by first synthesizing a time series from the model, and then aligning it to the
true time series through dynamic time warping. We propose a technique that
increases the similarity of both time series before aligning them, by mapping
them into a latent correlation space. The mapping is learned from the data
through a machine-learning setup. Experiments on data from non-destructive
testing demonstrate that the proposed approach shows significant improvements
over the state of the art.

systems which are frequently used in production lines. With these systems that
provide contactless control and measurement, production facilities are able to
reach high production numbers without errors. Machine vision operations such as
product counting, error control, dimension measurement can be performed through
a camera. In this paper, a machine vision application is proposed, which can
perform object-independent product counting. The proposed approach is based on
Otsu thresholding and Hough transformation and performs automatic counting
independently of product type and color. Basically one camera is used in the
system. Through this camera, an image of the products passing through a
conveyor is taken and various image processing algorithms are applied to these
images. In this approach using images obtained from a real experimental setup,
a real-time machine vision application was installed. As a result of the
experimental studies performed, it has been determined that the proposed
approach gives fast, accurate and reliable results.

  equation","Uncomplete version!",,,,"math.PR cond-mat.stat-mech math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We derive the porous medium equation from an interacting particle system
which belongs to the family of exclusion processes, with nearest neighbor
exchanges. The particles follow a degenerate dynamics, in the sense that the
jump rates can vanish for certain configurations, and there exist blocked
configurations that cannot evolve. In [Gon\c{c}alves-Landim-Toninelli '09] it
was proved that the macroscopic density profile in the hydrodynamic limit is
governed by the porous medium equation (PME), for initial densities uniformly
bounded away from $0$ and $1$. In this paper we consider the more general case
where the density can take those extreme values. In this context, the PME
solutions display a richer behavior, like moving interfaces, finite speed of
propagation and breaking of regularity. As a consequence, the standard
techniques that are commonly used to prove this hydrodynamic limits cannot be
straightforwardly applied to our case. We present here a way to generalize the
\emph{relative entropy method}, by involving approximations of solutions to the
hydrodynamic equation, instead of exact solutions.

partial-wave analysis (PWA) of a large data set of diffractive-dissociation
events from the reaction $\pi^- + p \to \pi^-\pi^-\pi^+ + p_\text{recoil}$ with
a 190 GeV/$c$ pion beam. The PWA results, which were obtained in 100 bins of
three-pion mass, $0.5 < m_{3\pi} < 2.5$ GeV/$c^2$, and simultaneously in 11
bins of the reduced four-momentum transfer squared, $0.1 < t' < 1.0$
$($GeV$/c)^2$, are subjected to a resonance-model fit using Breit-Wigner
amplitudes to simultaneously describe a subset of 14 selected waves using 11
isovector light-meson states with $J^{PC} = 0^{-+}$, $1^{++}$, $2^{++}$,
$2^{-+}$, $4^{++}$, and spin-exotic $1^{-+}$ quantum numbers. The model
contains the well-known resonances $\pi(1800)$, $a_1(1260)$, $a_2(1320)$,
$\pi_2(1670)$, $\pi_2(1880)$, and $a_4(2040)$. In addition, it includes the
disputed $\pi_1(1600)$, the excited states $a_1(1640)$, $a_2(1700)$, and
$\pi_2(2005)$, as well as the resonancelike $a_1(1420)$. We measure the
resonance parameters mass and width of these objects by combining the
information from the PWA results obtained in the 11 $t'$ bins. We extract the
relative branching fractions of the $\rho(770) \pi$ and $f_2(1270) \pi$ decays
of $a_2(1320)$ and $a_4(2040)$, where the former one is measured for the first
time. In a novel approach, we extract the $t'$ dependence of the intensity of
the resonances and of their phases. The $t'$ dependence of the intensities of
most resonances differs distinctly from the $t'$ dependence of the nonresonant
components. For the first time, we determine the $t'$ dependence of the phases
of the production amplitudes and confirm that the production mechanism of the
Pomeron exchange is common to all resonances.

  Perivascular Spaces in Brain MRI",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) in the brain are an emerging imaging
marker for cerebral small vessel disease, and have been shown to be related to
increased risk of various neurological diseases, including stroke and dementia.
Automatic quantification of EPVS would greatly help to advance research into
its etiology and its potential as a risk indicator of disease. We propose a
convolutional network regression method to quantify the extent of EPVS in the
basal ganglia from 3D brain MRI. We first segment the basal ganglia and
subsequently apply a 3D convolutional regression network designed for small
object detection within this region of interest. The network takes an image as
input, and outputs a quantification score of EPVS. The network has
significantly more convolution operations than pooling ones and no final
activation, allowing it to span the space of real numbers. We validated our
approach using a dataset of 2000 brain MRI scans scored visually. Experiments
with varying sizes of training and test sets showed that a good performance can
be achieved with a training set of only 200 scans. With a training set of 1000
scans, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between our scoring method
and the expert's visual score was 0.74. Our method outperforms by a large
margin - more than 0.10 - four more conventional automated approaches based on
intensities, scale-invariant feature transform, and random forest. We show that
the network learns the structures of interest and investigate the influence of
hyper-parameters on the performance. We also evaluate the reproducibility of
our network using a set of 60 subjects scanned twice (scan-rescan
reproducibility). On this set our network achieves an ICC of 0.93, while the
intrarater agreement reaches 0.80. Furthermore, the automatic EPVS scoring
correlates similarly to age as visual scoring.

more massive than 10$^{10} \rm \, M_{\odot}$ that are divided into four groups:
cluster centrals (3%), cluster satellites (33%), group centrals (5%), and field
ETGs (59%). We find a strong mass dependence of the slow rotator fraction,
$f_{\rm SR}$, and the mean spin of massive ETGs. Although we do not find a
clear environmental dependence of $f_{\rm SR}$, a weak trend is seen in the
mean value of spin parameter driven by the satellite ETGs as they gradually
lose their spin as their environment becomes denser. Galaxy mergers appear to
be the main cause of total spin changes in 94% of central ETGs of halos with
$M_{vir} > 10^{12.5}\rm M_{\odot}$, but only 22% of satellite and field ETGs.
We find that non-merger induced tidal perturbations better correlate with the
galaxy spin-down in satellite ETGs than mergers. Given that the majority of
ETGs are not central in dense environments, we conclude that non-merger tidal
perturbation effects played a key role in the spin evolution of ETGs observed
in the local ($z < 1$) universe.

which is essential for sustainable production in the long term. A holistic
approach that considers a robotic cell as a whole toward minimizing energy
consumption is proposed. The mathematical model, which takes into account
various robot speeds, positions, power-saving modes, and alternative orders of
operations, can be transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming
formulation that is, however, suitable only for small instances. To optimize
complex robotic cells, a hybrid heuristic accelerated by using multicore
processors and the Gurobi simplex method for piecewise linear convex functions
is implemented. The experimental results showed that the heuristic solved 93 %
of instances with a solution quality close to a proven lower bound. Moreover,
compared with the existing works, which typically address problems with three
to four robots, this study solved real-size problem instances with up to 12
robots and considered more optimization aspects. The proposed algorithms were
also applied on an existing robotic cell in \v{S}koda Auto. The outcomes, based
on simulations and measurements, indicate that, compared with the previous
state (at maximal robot speeds and without deeper power-saving modes), the
energy consumption can be reduced by about 20 % merely by optimizing the robot
speeds and applying power-saving modes. All the software and generated datasets
used in this research are publicly available.

performance of these models rely heavily on the size of the dataset, i.e.,

In this work, we propose an inductive transfer learning method that can augment

representations from a source dataset, \textit{without inheriting anything}
from the source learning model. Representations of the instances of

\textit{locality sensitive hashing}, and then, augmented into the model during
training on the target dataset. Our approach simultaneously exploits the local
\textit{instance level information} as well as the macro statistical viewpoint
of the dataset. Using this approach we have shown significant improvements for
three major news classification datasets over the baseline. Experimental
evaluations also show that the proposed approach reduces dependency on labeled
data by a significant margin for comparable performance. With our proposed
cross dataset learning procedure we show that one can achieve
competitive/better performance than learning from a single dataset.

challenging, since the conclusions can vary significantly depending on the
locations of the validation set. This work proposes the use of cross-validation
techniques to assess the goodness of fit of spatial models in different regions
of the spatial domain to account for uncertainty in the choice of the
validation sets. An obvious problem with the basic cross-validation scheme is
that it is based on selecting only a few out of sample locations to validate
the model, possibily making the conclusions sensitive to which partition of the
data into training and validation cases is utilized. A possible solution to
this issue would be to consider all possible configurations of data divided
into training and validation observations. From a Bayesian point of view, this
could be computationally demanding, as estimation of parameters usually
requires Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. To deal with this problem, we
propose the use of estimated discrepancy functions considering all
configurations of data partition in a computationally efficient manner based on
sampling importance resampling. In particular, we consider uncertainty in the
locations by assigning a prior distribution to them. Furthermore, we propose a
stratified cross-validation scheme to take into account spatial heterogeneity,
reducing the total variance of estimated predictive discrepancy measures
considered for model assessment. We illustrate the advantages of our proposal
with simulated examples of homogeneous and inhomogeneous spatial processes to
investigate the effects of our proposal in scenarios of preferential sampling
designs. The methods are illustrated with an application to a rainfall dataset.

interest groups becomes pivotal in mobilizing and championing emerging research
on undone topics. Clearly money is one of the most important mediums through
which different types of actors can support and steer scientists to work on
undone topics. Yet which actors are more visible in their support for
scientific research is something which has seldom been measured. This study
delves into research funding in the context of rare diseases research, a topic
which has evolved from the margins of medical research into a priority area
articulated by many contemporary funding agencies. Rare diseases refer to
conditions affecting relatively few people in a population. Given low
incidences, interest groups have articulated a lack of attention within medical
research compared to more common conditions. The rise to prominence of rare
diseases in research funding policies is often explained in the science studies
literature in terms of effective lobbying by social movements Likewise,
innovative fundraising initiatives, infrastructure building, and close
partnerships with research groups are other means through which interested
actors have sought to build capacity for research into rare medical conditions.
To date however systematic empirical evidence to compare the relative
importance of different actors in funding rare disease research has not been
produced. Building on interest in undone science in STS and science policy
studies, our study hopes to map-out different kinds of funding actors and their
influence on leading scientific research on rare diseases, by use of
bibliometric tools. The approach we are developing relies on the use of Funding
Acknowledgement data provided in Web of Science database.

cosmological constant or effective potential for scalar fields. For a positive
effective scalar potential, one-loop perturbation theory around flat space is
divergent due to an instability of the graviton propagator. Functional
renormalization solves this problem by a flow of couplings avoiding
instabilities. This leads to a graviton barrier limiting the maximal growth of
the effective potential for large values of scalar fields. In the presence of
this barrier, variable gravity with a field dependent Planck mass can solve the
cosmological constant problem by a cosmological runaway solution. We discuss
the naturalness of tiny values of the cosmological constant and cosmon mass due
to a strong attraction towards an infrared fixed point.

research on innovation initiatives and to identify the challenges of

investigation was performed using a systematic mapping approach of published

complemented with interviews with four experts with rich industry experience.
Our study results suggest that, there is a lack of high quality empirical
studies on innovation initiative in the context of large software companies. A
total of 7 studies are conducted in such context, which reported 5 types of
initiatives: intrapreneurship, bootlegging, internal venture, spin-off and
crowdsourcing. Our study offers three contributions. First, this paper
represents the map of existing literature on innovation initiatives inside
large companies. The second contribution is to provide an innovation initiative
tree. The third contribution is to identify key challenges faced by each
initiative in large software companies. At the strategic and tactical levels,
there is no difference between large software companies and other companies. At
the operational level, large software companies are highly influenced by the
advancement of Internet technology. Large software companies use open
innovation paradigm as part of their innovation initiatives. We envision a
future work is to further empirically evaluate the innovation initiative tree
in large software companies, which involves more practitioners from different

phase via derivative of LE in equilibrium, we show that in the non-equilibrium
situation, the spin chain requires a temporal window to realize the effect of
disorder. We show that within this timescale, LE falls off exponentially and
this decay is maximally controlled by the initial states and coupling strength.
Our detail investigation suggests that there actually exist three types of
exponential decay, a Gaussian decay in ultra short time scale followed by two
exponential decay in the intermediate time with two different decay exponents.
The effect of the disorder starts appearing in the late time power law fall of
LE where the power law exponent is strongly dependent on disorder strength and
the final state but almost independent of initial states and coupling strength.
This feature allows us to indicate the presence of Griffiths phase. To be
precise, continuously varying critical exponent and wide distribution of
relaxation time imprint their effect in LE in the late time limit where the
power law fall is absent for quenching to a Griffiths phase. Here, LE vanishes
following the fast exponential fall. Interestingly, for off-critical quenching
LE attains a higher saturation value for increasing disorder strength,
otherwise vanishes for a clean spin chain, referring to the fact that disorder
prohibits the rapid decay of entanglement in long time limit. Moreover, we show
that disorder is also able to destroy the light cone like nature of post quench
quasi-particles as LE does not sense the singular time scales appearing for
clean spin chain with qubits coupled at symmetric positions.

fractured porous media, which we term the mixed-dimensional flux coupling
scheme. Our formulation is agnostic to the discretizations used to discretize
the fluid flow equations in the porous medium and in the fractures, and as such
it represents a unified approach to integrated fractured geometries into any
existing discretization framework. In particular, several existing
discretization approaches for fractured porous media can be seen as special
instances of the approach proposed herein.
  We provide an abstract stability theory for our approach, which provides
explicit guidance into the grids used to discretize the fractures and the
porous medium, as dependent on discretization methods chosen for the respective
domains. The theoretical results are sustained by numerical examples, wherein
we utilize our framework to simulate flow in 2D and 3D fractured media using
control volume methods (both two-point and multi-point flux), Lagrangian finite
element methods, mixed finite element methods, and virtual element methods. As
expected, regardless of the ambient methods chosen, our approach leads to
stable and convergent discretizations for the fractured problems considered,
within the limits of the discretization schemes.

mapped to a fixed, nominal domain. The randomness is thus transferred to the
diffusion matrix and the loading. While this domain mapping method is quite
efficient for theory and practice, since only a single domain discretisation is
needed, it also requires the knowledge of the domain mapping.
  However, in certain applications, the random domain is only described by its
random boundary, while the quantity of interest is defined on a fixed,
deterministic subdomain. In this setting, it thus becomes necessary to compute
a random domain mapping on the whole domain, such that the domain mapping is
the identity on the fixed subdomain and maps the boundary of the chosen fixed,
nominal domain on to the random boundary.
  To overcome the necessity of computing such a mapping, we therefore couple
the finite element method on the fixed subdomain with the boundary element
method on the random boundary. We verify the required regularity of the
solution with respect to the random domain mapping for the use of multilevel
quadrature, derive the coupling formulation, and show by numerical results that
the approach is feasible.

compute emergy of a system. Recently, using this max-plus algebra approach, it
has been shown that the Maximum Empower Principle can be formalized as a new
combinatorial optimization problem (called the Maximum Empower Problem).
  In this paper we show that the Maximum Empower Problem can be solved by
finding a maximum weighted clique in a cograph, which leads to an
exponential-time algorithm in the worst-case. We also provide a polynomial-time
algorithm when there is no cycle in the graph modeling the system. Finally, we
prove that the Maximum Empower Problem is #P-hard in the general case, i.e. it
is as hard as computing the permanent of a matrix.

taking into account water availability, in addition to fire, since both factors
are known to be important for shaping savanna physiognomies along a climatic
gradient. As in our previous models, we consider two nonlinear functions of
grass and tree biomasses to respectively take into account grass-fire
feedbacks, and the response of trees to fire of a given intensity. The novelty
is that rainfall is taken into account in the tree and grass growth functions
and in the biomass carrying capacities. Then, we derive a qualitative analysis
of the ODE model, showing existence of equilibria, and studying their stability
conditions. We also construct a two dimension bifurcation diagram based on
rainfall and fire frequency. This led to summarize different scenarios for the
model including multi-stabilities that are proven possible. Next, to bring more
realism in the model, pulsed fire events are modelled as part of an IDE
(Impulsive differential Equations) system analogous to the ODE system.
Numerical simulations are provided and we discuss some important ecological
outcomes that our ODE and IDE models are able to predict. Notably, the
expansion of forest into tree-poor physiognomies (grassland and savanna) is
systematically predicted when fire return period increases, especially in mesic
and humid climatic areas.

model action that can be quantized through path integrals. The latter require a
precise regularization to deal with the derivative interactions arising from
the nonlinear kinetic term. Recently, for maximally symmetric spaces,
simplified path integrals have been developed: they allow to trade the
nonlinear kinetic term with a purely quadratic kinetic term (linear sigma
model). This happens at the expense of introducing a suitable effective scalar
potential, which contains the information on the curvature of the space. The
simplified path integral provides a sensible gain in the efficiency of
perturbative calculations. Here we extend the construction to models with N = 1
supersymmetry on the worldline, which are applicable to the first quantized
description of a Dirac fermion. As an application we use the simplified
worldline path integral to compute the type-A trace anomaly of a Dirac fermion
in d dimensions up to d = 16.

models in the framework of DBI non-canonical scalar field with constant sound

density and tensor gravitational perturbations. Then, we derive different
inflationary observables including the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the running
of the scalar spectral index $dn_s/d\ln k$, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.
We show that the 95\% CL constraint of the Planck 2015 T+E data on the
non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{{\rm NL}}^{{\rm DBI}}$ leads to the sound speed
bound $c_{s}\geq0.087$ in the DBI inflation. Moreover, our results imply that,
although the predictions of the power-law, intermediate, and logamediate
inflations in the standard canonical framework ($c_s=1$) are not consistent
with the Planck 2015 data, in the DBI scenario with constant sound speed
$c_s<1$, the result of the $r-n_s$ diagram for these models can lie inside the
68\% CL region favored by the Planck 2015 TT,TE,EE+lowP data. We also specify
the parameter space of the power-law, intermediate, and logamediate inflations
for which our models are compatible with the 68\% or 95\% CL regions of the
Planck 2015 TT,TE,EE+lowP data. Using the allowed ranges of the parameter space
of the intermediate and logamediate inflationary models, we estimate the
running of the scalar spectral index and find that it is compatible with the

such studies: modern gamma multi-detectors present increasing performances in
terms of sensitivity and efficiency, allowing to extend ever more our ability
to observe and characterize abundant nuclear states. For instance, the
high-spin part of level schemes often reflects intriguing nuclear shape
phenomena: this behaviour is unveiled by high-fold experimental data analysed
through multi-coincidence spectra, in which long deexcitation cascades become
observable. Determining the intensity of newly discovered transitions is
important to characterize the nuclear structure and formation mechanism of the
emitting levels. However, it is not trivial to relate the apparent intensity
observed in multi-gated spectra to the actual transition intensity. In this

have obtained analytic expressions from which data-analysis methods can
eventually be derived to recover this link in a rigorous way.

executing in closed-loop with a vehicle simulation model. This approach enables
to move certain development tasks from road or test rigs and HiL (Hardware in
the loop) to PCs, where they can often be performed faster and cheaper. Renault
has recently established such a virtualization process for powertrain control
software based on Simulink models. If the number of runnables exceeds a
threshold (about 1500) the execution of the virtual ECU is no longer straight
forward and specific techniques are required. This paper describes the
motivation behind a Simulink model based process, the virtualization process
and applications of the resulting virtual ECUs. Domain: Critical Transportation
Systems Topic: Processes, methods and tools, in particular: virtual engineering
and simulation 1. Motivation Since 2010, Renault has established a framework to
develop engine control software for Diesel and Gasoline engines [6]. The
framework is heavily based on MATLAB/Simulink and the idea of model-based
development, which facilitates the carry-over and carry-across of application
software between software projects. In the Renault EMS architecture software is
composed in to about 20 functions, such as Air System, Combustion etc. A
function consists of modules. A module is the smallest testable software unit
and contains runnables to be scheduled and executed by the Operating System
(Os) of the ECU. The Renault EMS development process includes basically the
following steps [5]. 1. Specification of about 200 generic configurable modules
per ECU using MATLAB/Simulink. 2. Generation of C code (EMS application
software) from all module specifications using MATLAB/Simulink Embedded Coder.
3. MiL (Model in the Loop) test and validation of the resulting executable
specifications at module level in a simulated system environment, considering
only essential interactions with other modules and system environment. This is
essentially a back-to-back test to make sure that the Simulink model of a
module and the corresponding production C code show equivalent and intended
behaviour. To insure software quality, this step is repeatedly performed with
steps 1 and 2, based on the simulation capabilities of MATLAB/Simulink. 4.
Configuration of modules to fit to the specific needs of a software project,
such as absence or presence of certain components. 5. Integration of generated
configured C code and hand-coded platform software (basic software) on supplied
target hardware, a real ECU that communicates with other controllers via CAN
and other busses. 6. Validation and test of all modules on system level using
the real ECU. In contrast to step 3, the interactions of all modules and
interactions with the system environment are visible then and subject to
testing. For example, the Os runs all scheduled runnables then, not just those
of the modules considered to be 'essential' for a module under test. Critical
assessment of the above process shows that there is a considerable delay
between delivery of a set of specifications to the software project team (at
the end of step 3) and system-level tests based on an ECU that runs entire
software (step 6). Typical delays are weeks or months.

cope with unseen data, adaptation techniques are deployed. For unlabeled unseen
data, one must generate some hypothesis given an existing model, which is used
as the label for model adaptation. However, assessing the goodness of the
hypothesis can be difficult, and an erroneous hypothesis can lead to poorly
trained models. In such cases, a strategy to select data having reliable
hypothesis can ensure better model adaptation. This work proposes a
data-selection strategy for DNN model adaptation, where DNN output layer
activations are used to ascertain the goodness of a generated hypothesis. In a
DNN acoustic model, the output layer activations are used to generate target
class probabilities. Under unseen data conditions, the difference between the
most probable target and the next most probable target is decreased compared to
the same for seen data, indicating that the model may be uncertain while
generating its hypothesis. This work proposes a strategy to assess a model's
performance by analyzing the output layer activations by using a distance
measure between the most likely target and the next most likely target, which
is used for data selection for performing unsupervised adaptation.

propagator in the lowest Landau levels for quarks and the Feynman propagator
for gluons in real-time formalism, we have calculated the resummed retarded and
symmetric propagators, which in turn give the real and imaginary components of
dielectric permittivity, respectively. The magnetic field affects the
large-distance interaction more than the short-distance interaction, as a
result, the real part of potential becomes more attractive and the magnitude of
imaginary part too becomes larger, compared to the thermal medium in absence of
strong magnetic field. As a consequence the average size of $J/\psi$'s and
$\psi^\prime$'s are increased but $\chi_c$'s get shrunk. Similarly the magnetic
field affects the binding of $J/\psi$'s and $\chi_c$'s discriminately, i.e. it
decreases the binding of $J/\psi$ and increases for $\chi_c$. However, the
further increase in magnetic field results in the decrease of binding energies.
On contrary the magnetic field increases the width of the resonances, unless
the temperature is sufficiently high. We have finally studied how the presence
of magnetic field affects the dissolution of quarkonia in a thermal medium due
to the Landau damping, where the dissociation temperatures are found to
increase compared to the thermal medium in absence of magnetic field. However,
further increase of magnetic field decreases the dissociation temperatures. For
example, $J/\psi$'s and $\chi_c$'s are dissociated at higher temperatures at 2
$T_c$ and 1.1 $T_c$ at a magnetic field $eB \approx 6~{\rm{and}}~4~m_\pi^2$,

temperature transferability of the Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials used in
this work is strongly dependent on the cut-off radius and the inclusion of the
unbound 3d$^0$ state. The finite temperature indirect band gaps are highly
sensitive to the choice of cut-off radius used in the pseudopotentials. The
finite temperature band structures and density of states show that thermal
vibrations affect the electron energies throughout the valence and conduction
band. We compare our results on the band gap shifts with that due to the
Debye-Waller term in the Allen-Heine theory and discuss the observed
differences in the zero point and high temperature band gap shifts. Although,
the electron energy shifts in the highest occupied valence band and lowest
unoccupied conduction band enable to obtain the changes in the indirect and
direct band gaps at finite temperatures, the shifts in other electronic levels
with temperature enable investigations into the finite temperature valence
charge distribution in the bonding region. Thus, we demonstrate that the Allen
theory provides a simple and theoretically justified formalism to obtain finite

Reactors (SMRs) might address these issues. Megaprojects are extremely risky
and often implemented after a sub-optimal phase of project planning leading to
underestimations of the costs and overestimation of short-term benefits. When
considering adherence to schedule and budget, often megaprojects might be
considered a failure, and optimism bias, strategic mis-rapresentation,
complexity, poor planning, poor risk allocation, poor scope management are all
reasons to explain their over budget and delay. For megaprojects, especially in
the nuclear field, a key strategy to achieve good performances appears to be
the standardization. This standardization needs to be twofold: (i) technical
standardisation, i.e. the construction of very similar design over and over,
and (ii) the project delivery chain standardisation, i.e. the same stakeholders
involved in the delivery of a project that is replicable multiple times. Under
this perspective, given their size and standardisation potential, SMRs, might
be a suitable class of NPP for several countries. Yet, if the economy of scale
is the only driver considered, SMRs are hardly competitive with large NPPs (or
even with gas or coal power plants). However, a fleet of standard SMRs might
balance the lack of economy of scale with the economy of multiples, and the
delivery of several standardised SMR projects might be the key to achieve good
project management performances in the nuclear sector. However, the deployment
of SMRs faces a number of challenges from several perspectives, such as the
licencing, supply chain and financing ones. These challenges might be enormous,
but so are the potential rewards too.

interactions, which allows to investigate the underlying assumptions present in

  results from long-baseline neutrino experiments","21 pages, 5 figures. v2: matching version to be published in JHEP.
  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1705.01935",,"10.1007/JHEP05(2018)073",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We confront recent experimental results on neutrino mixing parameters with
the requirements from strong thermal $SO(10)$-inspired leptogenesis, where the
asymmetry is produced from next-to-lightest right-handed neutrinos $N_2$
independently of the initial conditions. There is a nice agreement with latest
global analyses supporting $\sin\delta < 0$ and normal ordering at $ \sim 95\%$
C.L. On the other hand, the more stringent experimental lower bound on the
atmospheric mixing angle starts to corner strong thermal $SO(10)$-inspired
leptogenesis. Prompted and encouraged by this rapid experimental advance, we
obtain a precise determination of the allowed region in the plane $\delta$
versus $\theta_{23}$. We confirm that for the benchmark case $\alpha_2 \equiv
m_{D2} / m_{\rm charm}= 5 \, $, where $m_{D2}$ is the intermediate neutrino
Dirac mass setting the $N_2$ mass, and initial pre-existing asymmetry
$N_{B-L}^{\rm p, i} = 10^{-3}$, the bulk of solutions lies in the first octant.
Though most of the solutions are found outside the $95\%$ C.L. experimental
region, there is still a big allowed fraction that does not require a too
fine-tuned choice of the Majorana phases so that the neutrinoless double beta
decay effective neutrino mass allowed range is still $m_{ee}\simeq
[10,30]\,{\rm meV}$. We also show how the constraints depend on $N_{B-L}^{\rm
p, i}$ and $\alpha_2$. In particular, we show that the current best fit,
($\theta_{23},\delta)\simeq (47^{\circ}, -130^{\circ})$, can be reproduced for
$N_{B-L}^{\rm p, i} = 10^{-3}$ and $\alpha_2 = 6$. Such large values for
$\alpha_2$ have been recently obtained in a few realistic fits within
$SO(10)$-inspired models. Finally, we also obtain that current neutrino data
rule out $N_{B-L}^{\rm p, i} \gtrsim 0.1$ for $\alpha_2 \lesssim 4.7$.

settings; prior explainable models have been unimodal, offering either
image-based visualization of attention weights or text-based generation of
post-hoc justifications. We propose a multimodal approach to explanation, and
argue that the two modalities provide complementary explanatory strengths. We
collect two new datasets to define and evaluate this task, and propose a novel
model which can provide joint textual rationale generation and attention
visualization. Our datasets define visual and textual justifications of a
classification decision for activity recognition tasks (ACT-X) and for visual
question answering tasks (VQA-X). We quantitatively show that training with the
textual explanations not only yields better textual justification models, but
also better localizes the evidence that supports the decision. We also
qualitatively show cases where visual explanation is more insightful than
textual explanation, and vice versa, supporting our thesis that multimodal
explanation models offer significant benefits over unimodal approaches.

that there occurs colour confinement in QCD but there is no confinement in QED.

demonstrated as the dynamical effect of QCD or more explicitly the dynamical

fluctuations in physical systems. RMT is capable of making predictions for the
fluctuations only after the removal of the secular properties of the spectrum.
Spectral unfolding procedure is used to separate the local level fluctuations
from overall energy dependence of the level separation. The unfolding procedure
is not unique. Several studies showed that statistics of long-term correlation
in the spectrum are very sensitive to the choice of the unfolding function in
polynomial unfolding. This can give misleading results regarding the chaoticity
of quantum systems. In this letter, we consider the spectra of ordered
eigenvalues of large random matrices. We show that the main cause behind the
reported sensitivity to the unfolding polynomial degree is the inclusion of
specific extreme eigenvalue(s) in the unfolding process.

method as well as numerical shooting method, the relation between critical
temperature and charge density, $\rho$, and disclose the effects of both
nonlinear parameter $b$ and the dimensions of spacetime, $d$, on the critical
temperature $T_c$. We find that in each dimension, $T_c/{\rho}^{1/(d-2)}$
decreases with increasing the nonlinear parameter $b$ while it increases with
increasing the dimension of spacetime for a fixed value of $b$. Then, we
calculate the condensation value and critical exponent of the system

condensation get larger with increasing the nonlinear parameter $b$. Besides,
for a fixed value of $b$, it increases with increasing the spacetime dimension.
We confirm that the results obtained from our analytical method are in
agreement with the results obtained from numerical shooting method. This fact
may support the correctness of our analytical method. Finally, we explore the
