(such as mobile nanorods) as well as the effective interaction mediated by them
between two plane-parallel surfaces that carry fixed (quenched) heterogeneous
charge distributions. The rodlike counterions are assumed to have an internal
charge distribution, specified by a multivalent monopolar moment and a finite
quadrupolar moment, and the quenched surface charge is assumed to be randomly
distributed with equal mean and variance on the two surfaces. While equally
charged surfaces are known to repel within the traditional mean-field theories,
the presence of multivalent counterions has been shown to cause attractive
interactions between uniformly charged surfaces due to the prevalence of strong
electrostatic couplings that grow rapidly with the counterion valency. We show
that the combined effects due to electrostatic correlations (caused by the
coupling between the mean surface field and the multivalent, monopolar, charge
valency of counterions) as well as the disorder-induced interactions (caused by
the coupling between the surface disorder field and the quadrupolar moment of
counterions) lead to much stronger attractive interactions between two randomly
charged surfaces. The interaction profile turns out to be a nonmonotonic
function of the intersurface separation, displaying an attractive minimum at
relatively small separations, where the ensuing attraction can exceed the
maximum strong-coupling attraction (produced by multivalent monopolar
counterions between uniformly charged surfaces) by more than an order of
magnitude.

shock transitions in the supersonic flow of a hard sphere gas. We start by
examining one-dimensional, nonlinear, nondispersive planar wave solutions of
the Enskog-Navier-Stokes equations, which move in a fixed direction at a
constant speed. By further equating the speed of the reference frame with the
speed of such a wave, we reduce the Enskog-Navier-Stokes equations into a more
simple system of two ordinary differential equations, whose solutions depend on
a single scalar spatial variable. We then observe that this system has two
fixed points, which are taken to be the states of the gas before and after the
shock, and compute the corresponding shock transition in the form of the
heteroclinic orbit connecting these two states. We find that the Enskog
correction affects both the difference between the fixed points, and the
thickness of the transition. In particular, for a given state of the gas before
the shock transition, the difference between the fixed points is reduced, while
the shock thickness is increased, with the relative impact on the properties of
transition being more prominent at low Mach numbers. We also compute the speed
of sound in the Enskog-Navier-Stokes equations, and find that, for the same
thermodynamic state, it is somewhat faster than that in the conventional
Navier-Stokes equations, with an additional dependence on the density of the
gas.

the energy transfer in the near field loses quantitative accuracy compared with

learning. Dyna is a planning paradigm that naturally interleaves learning and
planning, by simulating one-step experience to update the action-value
function. This elegant planning strategy has been mostly explored in the
tabular setting. The aim of this paper is to revisit sample-based planning, in
stochastic and continuous domains with learned models. We first highlight the
flexibility afforded by a model over Experience Replay (ER). Replay-based
methods can be seen as stochastic planning methods that repeatedly sample from
a buffer of recent agent-environment interactions and perform updates to
improve data efficiency. We show that a model, as opposed to a replay buffer,
is particularly useful for specifying which states to sample from during
planning, such as predecessor states that propagate information in reverse from
a state more quickly. We introduce a semi-parametric model learning approach,
called Reweighted Experience Models (REMs), that makes it simple to sample next
states or predecessors. We demonstrate that REM-Dyna exhibits similar
advantages over replay-based methods in learning in continuous state problems,
and that the performance gap grows when moving to stochastic domains, of
increasing size.

defined, unbounded, self-adjoint, monotone in the Hilbert space $L^2(\Omega)$,
for some bounded and smooth domain $\Omega$, and have compact resolvents. Our
definition of the fractional powers of operators uses the approach via spectral
theory. A nonlinearity of double-well type occurs in the phase equation and
either a regular or logarithmic potential, as well as a non-differentiable

general well-posedness and regularity results, extending the corresponding
results that are known for the non-fractional elliptic operators with zero
Neumann conditions or other boundary conditions like Dirichlet or Robin ones.
Then, we investigate the longtime behavior of the system, by fully
characterizing every element of the $\omega$-limit as a stationary solution. In
the final part of the paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the system as
the parameter $\sigma$ appearing in the operator $B^{2\sigma}$ that plays in
the phase equation decreasingly tends to zero. We can prove convergence to a
phase relaxation problem at the limit, in which an additional term containing
the projection of the phase variable on the kernel of $B$ appears.

requires sophisticated interrogation schemes and robust protocols handling
pulse length errors and residual frequency detuning offsets . This review
reports recent progress and perspective in such schemes, using sequences of
composite laser-pulses tailored in pulse duration, frequency and phase,
inspired by NMR techniques and quantum information processing. After a short
presentation of Rabi technique and NMR-like composite pulses allowing efficient
compensation of electromagnetic field perturbations to achieve robust
population transfers, composite laser-pulses are investigated within Ramsey's
method of separated oscillating fields in order to generate non-linear
compensation of probe-induced frequency shifts. Laser-pulses protocols such as
Hyper-Ramsey (HR), Modified Hyper-Ramsey (MHR), Generalized Hyper-Ramsey (GHR)
and hybrid schemes are reviewed. These techniques provide excellent protection
against both probe induced light-shift perturbations and laser intensity
variations. More sophisticated schemes generating synthetic frequency-shifts
are presented. They allow to reduce or completely eliminate imperfect
correction of probe-induced frequency-shifts even in presence of decoherence
due to the laser line-width. Finally, two universal protocols are presented
which provide complete elimination of probe-induced frequency shifts in the
general case where both decoherence and relaxation dissipation effects are
present by using exact analytic expressions for phase-shifts and the clock
frequency detuning. These techniques might be applied to atomic, molecular and
nuclear frequency metrology, mass spectrometry as well as precision

  Boots","Accelerating Imitation Learning with Predictive Models",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sample efficiency is critical in solving real-world reinforcement learning
problems, where agent-environment interactions can be costly. Imitation
learning from expert advice has proved to be an effective strategy for reducing
the number of interactions required to train a policy. Online imitation
learning, which interleaves policy evaluation and policy optimization, is a
particularly effective technique with provable performance guarantees. In this
work, we seek to further accelerate the convergence rate of online imitation
learning, thereby making it more sample efficient. We propose two model-based
algorithms inspired by Follow-the-Leader (FTL) with prediction: MoBIL-VI based
on solving variational inequalities and MoBIL-Prox based on stochastic
first-order updates. These two methods leverage a model to predict future
gradients to speed up policy learning. When the model oracle is learned online,
these algorithms can provably accelerate the best known convergence rate up to
an order. Our algorithms can be viewed as a generalization of stochastic
Mirror-Prox (Juditsky et al., 2011), and admit a simple constructive FTL-style
analysis of performance.

which are words over a finite alphabet $\Sigma$. One may ask whether $w$ occurs
in $t$, and if so, where? More generally, we may have a set $P$ of patterns and
a set $T$ of texts, where $P$ and $T$ are regular languages. We are interested
whether any word of $T$ begins with a word of $P$, ends with a word of $P$, has
a word of $P$ as a factor, or has a word of $P$ as a subsequence. Thus we are
interested in the languages $(P\Sigma^*)\cap T$, $(\Sigma^*P)\cap T$,
$(\Sigma^* P\Sigma^*)\cap T$, and $(\Sigma^* \mathbin{\operatorname{shu}}
P)\cap T$, where $\operatorname{shu}$ is the shuffle operation. The state
complexity $\kappa(L)$ of a regular language $L$ is the number of states in the
minimal deterministic finite automaton recognizing $L$. We derive the following
upper bounds on the state complexities of our pattern-matching languages, where
$\kappa(P)\le m$, and $\kappa(T)\le n$: $\kappa((P\Sigma^*)\cap T) \le mn$;
$\kappa((\Sigma^*P)\cap T) \le 2^{m-1}n$; $\kappa((\Sigma^*P\Sigma^*)\cap T)

the alphabet must have at least two letters in the first three cases, and at
least $m-1$ letters in the last case. We also consider the special case where
$P$ is a single word $w$, and obtain the following tight upper bounds:
$\kappa((w\Sigma^*)\cap T_n) \le m+n-1$; $\kappa((\Sigma^*w)\cap T_n) \le
(m-1)n-(m-2)$; $\kappa((\Sigma^*w\Sigma^*)\cap T_n) \le (m-1)n$; and

challenging task as it directly associates high-level semantic to low-level

optimizes segmentation network. We start from initial localization produced by
classification networks. While classification networks are only responsive to
small and coarse discriminative object regions, we argue that, these regions
contain significant common features about objects. So in the bottom-up step, we
mine common object features from the initial localization and expand object
regions with the mined features. To supplement non-discriminative regions,
saliency maps are then considered under Bayesian framework to refine the object
regions. Then in the top-down step, the refined object regions are used as
supervision to train the segmentation network and to predict object masks.
These object masks provide more accurate localization and contain more regions
of object. Further, we take these object masks as initial localization and mine
common object features from them. These processes are conducted iteratively to
progressively produce fine object masks and optimize segmentation networks.
Experimental results on Pascal VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

boundary setting. As a key ingredient to this construction, we show an energy
convexity for weakly harmonic maps with mixed Dirichlet and free boundaries
from the half unit $2$-disk in $\mathbf{R}^2$ into any closed Riemannian

with momenta of order Hubble, most of the axion energy density is contained in
axions with energy of order the string core scale, at least in the parameter
range available in the simulation. While such a spectrum would lead to a
negligible number density of relic axions from strings when extrapolated to the
physical parameter region, we show that the presence of small logarithmic
corrections to the spectrum shape could completely alter such a conclusion. A
detailed understanding of the evolution of the axion spectrum is therefore
crucial for a reliable estimate of the relic axion abundance from strings.

reproduce quantum cohomology and Coulomb branch relations in A-twisted gauge

proposal in a wide variety of examples. For instance, we construct mirrors
corresponding to Grassmannians and two-step flag manifolds, as well as complete
intersections therein, and explicitly check predictions for correlation
functions and quantum cohomology rings, as well as other properties. We also
consider mirrors to examples of gauge theories with U(k), U(k1) x U(k2), SU(k),
SO(2k), SO(2k+1), and Sp(2k) gauge groups and a variety of matter

fracton models,"" which host immobile fracton excitations in addition to
non-Abelian particles with restricted mobility. Starting from layers of
two-dimensional string-net models, whose spectrum includes non-Abelian anyons,
we condense extended one-dimensional ""flux-strings"" built out of point-like
excitations. Flux-string condensation generalizes the concept of anyon
condensation familiar from conventional topological order and allows us to
establish properties of the fracton ordered (equivalently, flux-string
condensed) phase, such as its ground state wave function and spectrum of
excitations. Through the examples of doubled Ising and SU(2)$_k$ cage-net
models, we demonstrate the existence of strictly immobile Abelian fractons and
of non-Abelian particles restricted to move only along one dimension. In the
doubled Ising cage-net model, we show that these restricted-mobility
non-Abelian excitations are a fundamentally three-dimensional phenomenon, as
they cannot be understood as bound states amongst two-dimensional non-Abelian
anyons and Abelian particles. We further show that the ground state wave
function of such phases can be understood as a fluctuating network of extended
objects -- cages -- and strings, which we dub a cage-net condensate. Besides
having implications for topological quantum computation in three dimensions,
our work may also point the way towards more general insights into quantum
phases of matter with fracton order.

mechanism of such ordering may provide routes to 3D Kitaev spin liquids. We
study a minimal 3D model including Kitaev $K$ and a symmetric off-diagonal
bond-dependent $\Gamma$ interaction on the hyperhoneycomb lattice using exact
diagonalization. We first show that a 12-site unitary transformation unveils a
Heisenberg model with hidden SU(2) symmetry when $K = \Gamma$. The magnetic
ordering in the transformed basis then generically maps to the counter-rotating
noncoplanar spiral order of the original spin. The moment direction depends on
perturbations away from the SU(2) point. When $K$ and $\Gamma$ are negative, a
positive Heisenberg interaction favors the (110)-direction reported in the
neutron scattering measurement on $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$. Our findings offer a
relevant set of microscopic parameters, which in turn guides a way to approach
possible Kitaev spin liquids.

electromagnetically neutral, can be a dark matter candidate while annihilation
and coannihilation between different $Z_2$ odd particles into standard model
leptons serve as the source of lepton asymmetry. The light neutrino masses
arise at one loop level with $Z_2$ odd fields going inside the loop. We show
that experimental data related to light neutrinos, dark matter relic abundance
and baryon asymmetry can be simultaneously satisfied in the model for two
different cases: one with fermion dark matter and the other with scalar dark
matter. In both scenarios, t-channel annihilation as well as coannihilation of
$Z_2$ odd particles play a non-trivial role in producing the non-zero CP
asymmetry. Both the scenarios remain allowed from DM direct detection while
keeping the scale of leptogenesis as low as TeV or less, lower than the one for
vanilla leptogenesis scenario in scotogenic model along with the additional
advantage of explaining the baryon-dark matter coincidence to some extent. Due
to such low scale, the model is testable through rare decay experiments looking
for charged lepton flavour violation.

(called super-Earths here, includes the so-called 'sub-Neptunes') orbit close
to their stars. As such, photoevaporation of their hydrogen envelopes etch
sharp features in an otherwise bland space spanned by planet radius and orbital
period. This, in turn, can be exploited to reveal the mass of these planets, in
addition to techniques such as radial velocity and transit-timing-variation.
Here, using updated radii for Kepler planet hosts from Gaia DR2, I show that
the photoevaporation features shift systematically to larger radius for planets
around more massive stars (ranging from M-dwarfs to F-dwarfs), corresponding to
a nearly linear scaling between planet mass and its host mass. By modelling
planet evolution under photo-evaporation, one further deduces that the masses
of super-Earths peak narrowly around $8 M_\oplus (M_*/M_\odot)$. Moreover, the
composition of their cores is likely terrestrial, and they were initially
coated with H/He envelopes a couple percent in mass. Interestingly, the masses
of these planets do not appear to depend on the metallicity values of their
host stars, while they may depend on the orbital separation weakly, possibly as
$r^{1/2}$. Taken together, the simplest interpretation of our results is that
super-Earths are at the so-called 'thermal mass', where the planet's Hill
radius is equal to the vertical scale height of the gas disk.

Our results support the conclusion that multi-jet observables can reliably
bound these anomalous interactions to the level that their impact on other key

even when a relatively small scalar field is considered, a rather strong valley
asymmetric scattering could arise as a function of the energy and angle of

two alleles. The population size and spatial structure are arbitrary, but
fixed. Genetics can be haploid, diploid, or otherwise; reproduction can be
asexual or sexual. Biological events (e.g.~births, deaths, mating, dispersal)
depend in arbitrary fashion on the current population state. Our formalism is
based on the idea of genetic sites. Each genetic site resides at a particular
locus and houses a single allele. Each individual contains a number of sites
equal to its ploidy (one for haploids, two for diploids, etc.). Selection
occurs via replacement events, in which alleles in some sites are replaced by
copies of others. Replacement events depend stochastically on the population
state, leading to a Markov chain representation of natural selection. Within
this formalism, we define reproductive value, fitness, neutral drift, and
fixation probability, and prove relationships among them. We identify four
criteria for evaluating which allele is selected and show that these become
equivalent in the limit of low mutation. We then formalize the method of weak
selection. The power of our formalism is illustrated with applications to
evolutionary games on graphs and to selection in a haplodiploid population.

lensing of both lightlike and timelike neutral rays in Reissner-Nordstr\""om
(RN) spacetimes. The exact deflection angle is found as an elliptical function
of the impact parameter $b$ and velocity $v$ of the ray, and the charge $Q$ of
the spacetime. In obtaining this angle, we found the critical impact parameter
$b_c$ and radius of particle sphere $r_c$ that are also dependent on $v$ and
$Q$. In general, both the increase of velocity and charge reduces the $b_c$ as
well as $r_c$. To study the effect of $v$ and $Q$ on the deflection angle
$\Delta\varphi$, its weak and strong deflection limits, relativistic and
non-relativistic limits, and small charge and extremal RN limits are analyzed
carefully. It is found that both the increase of velocity and charge reduces
the deflection angle. For weak deflection, the velocity and charge corrections
appear respectively in the $\mathcal{O}(1/b)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/b^2)$ orders.
For strong deflections, these two corrections appear in the same order. The
apparent angles and magnifications of weak and strong regular lensing, and
retro-lensing are studied for both lightlike and timelike rays. In general, in
all cases the increase of velocity or charge will decrease the apparent angle
of any order. We show that velocity correction is much larger than that of
charge in the weak lensing case, while their effects in the strong regular
lensing and retro-lensing are comparable. It is further shown that the apparent
angle and magnification in strong regular lensing and retro-lensing can be
effectively unified. Finally, we argue that the correction of $v$ and $Q$ on
the apparent angle can be correlated to mass or mass hierarchy of timelike
particles with certain energy. In addition, the effects of $v$ and $Q$ on
shadow size of black holes are discussed.

Cloud-resolving models better represent many of these processes and can now be

of computational limitations. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be
used to capture many advantages of cloud-resolving modeling at a fraction of
the computational cost. We train a deep neural network to represent all
atmospheric sub-grid processes in a climate model by learning from a
multi-scale model in which convection is treated explicitly. The trained neural
network then replaces the traditional sub-grid parameterizations in a global
general circulation model in which it freely interacts with the resolved
dynamics and the surface-flux scheme. The prognostic multi-year simulations are

simulation but also key aspects of variability, including precipitation
extremes and the equatorial wave spectrum. Furthermore, the neural network
approximately conserves energy despite not being explicitly instructed to.
Finally, we show that the neural network parameterization generalizes to new
surface forcing patterns but struggles to cope with temperatures far outside
its training manifold. Our results show the feasibility of using deep learning
for climate model parameterization. In a broader context, we anticipate that
data-driven Earth System Model development could play a key role in reducing

dimensional honeycomb lattice develops when driving the system with a pulsed
perturbation. A simple toy model that switches a valley Hall signal by breaking
inversion symmetry is studied in detail for slow quasi-adiabatic ramps and
sudden quenches, obtaining an oscillating dynamical response that depends
strongly on doping and time-averaged values that are determined both by the out
of equilibrium occupations and the Berry curvature of the final states. On the
other hand, the effect of irradiating the sample with a circularly-polarized
infrared pump pulse that breaks time reversal symmetry and thus ramps the
system into a non-trivial topological regime is probed. Even though there is a
non quantized average signal due to the break down of the Floquet adiabatical
picture, some features of the photon-dressed topological bands are revealed to
be present even in a few femtosecond timescale. Small frequency oscillations
during the transient response evidence the emergence of dynamical Floquet gaps
which are consistent with the instantaneous amplitude of the pump envelope. On
the other hand, a characteristic heterodyining effect is manifested in the
model. The presence of a remnant Hall response for ultra-short pulses that
contain only a few cycles of the radiation field is briefly discussed.

map confirms that [Fe/H] decreases with distance, from the inner halo to the
outer halo. We also explore the formation and chemical-evolution history of the
halo by considering the populations of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars
present in the AEGIS sample. The cumulative and differential frequencies of
CEMP-no stars (as classified by their characteristically lower levels of

distinctly different behaviors of the CEMP-no and CEMP-$s$ stars relieve the

caches to efficiently serve multiple unicast demands via common multicast
transmissions, leading to load reductions that are proportional to the
aggregate cache size. However, the increasingly dynamic, unpredictable, and
personalized nature of the content that users consume challenges the efficiency
of existing caching-based solutions in which only exact content reuse is
explored. This paper generalizes the cache-aided coded multicast problem to
specifically account for the correlation among content files, such as, for
example, the one between updated versions of dynamic data. It is shown that (i)
caching content pieces based on their correlation with the rest of the library,
and (ii) jointly compressing requested files using cached information as
references during delivery, can provide load reductions that go beyond those
achieved with existing schemes. This is accomplished via the design of a class
of correlation-aware achievable schemes, shown to significantly outperform
state-of-the-art correlation-unaware solutions. Our results show that as we
move towards real-time and/or personalized media dominated services, where
exact cache hits are almost non-existent but updates can exhibit high levels of

suitable for this purpose, which, however, remains open challenge to be

towards this direction, demonstrating 2D LN PhC slab nanoresonators with
optical Q as high as $3.51 \times 10^5$, about three orders of magnitude higher
than other 2D LN PhC structures reported to date. The high optical quality,
tight mode confinement, together with pure polarization characteristics of the
devices enable us to reveal peculiar anisotropy of photorefraction quenching
and unique anisotropic thermo-optic nonlinear response, which have never been
reported before. They also allow us to observe third harmonic generation for
the first time in on-chip LN nanophotonic devices, and strong
orientation-dependent generation of second harmonic. The demonstrated high-Q 2D
LN PhC nanoresonators not only offer an excellent device platform for the
exploration of extreme nonlinear and quantum optics at single-photon and
few-photon level, but also open up a great avenue towards future development of
large-scale integrated LN photonic circuits for energy efficient nonlinear

ionization and one intrashell transition of $d(\textrm{Co}^{2+})$ electrons.
Those optical properties are analyzed within the generalized gradient
approximation to the density functional theory. The two ionization channels
involve electron excitations from the two $\textrm{Co}^{2+}$ gap states, the
$t_{2\uparrow}$ triplet and the $e_{2\downarrow}$ doublet, to the conduction
band. The third possible ionization channel, in which an electron is excited
from the valence band to the $\textrm{Co}^{2+}$ level, requires energy in
excess of 4~eV, and cannot lead to absorption below the ZnO band gap, contrary
to earlier suggestions. We also consider two recombination channels, the direct
recombination and a two-step process, in which a photoelectron is captured by
$\textrm{Co}^{3+}$ and then recombines via the internal transition. Finally,
the observed increase the band gap with the Co concentration is well reproduced
by theory.
  The accurate description of ZnO:Co is achieved after including $+U$
corrections to the relevant orbitals of Zn, O, and Co. The $+U(\textrm{Co})$
value was calculated by the linear response approach, and independently was
obtained by fitting the calculated transition energies to the optical data. The
respective values, 3.4 and 3.0~eV, agree well. Ionization of Co induces large
energy shifts of the gap levels, driven by the varying Coulomb coupling between
the $d(\textrm{Co})$ electrons, and by large lattice relaxations around Co
ions. In turn, over $\sim 1$~eV changes of $\textrm{Co}^{2+}$ levels induced by
the internal transition are mainly caused by the occupation-dependent
$U(\textrm{Co})$ corrections.

sequences of stars of different composition (nucleonic, hyperonic, hybrid and

localize the target tissue types. When processing previously unseen cases, our
model's output is qualitatively very similar to the gold standard. In addition
to the standard metrics computed as a baseline for our approach, we asked three
additional pathologists to measure the Breslow thickness on the network's

inter-rater reliability (IRR) between the four pathologists was 75.0%. Given
the qualitative and quantitative results, it is possible to overcome the

between electromagnetic spectrum and luminosity, known as the {\em blazar

come from resolved high-luminosity BL Lacs or FSRQs, which can be directly
tested by the stacking limit. We find that the blazar TXS 0506+056 is on the

to their nonlocal curvature. More precisely, we consider a class of generalized
curvatures which correspond to the first variation of suitable nonlocal
perimeter functionals, defined in terms of an interaction kernel $K$, which is
symmetric, nonnegative, possibly singular at the origin, and satisfies
appropriate integrability conditions.
  We prove a general result about uniqueness of the geometric evolutions
starting from regular sets with positive $K$-curvature and we discuss the
fattening phenomenon for the evolution starting from the cross, showing that
this phenomenon is very sensitive to the strength of the interactions. As a
matter of fact, we show that the fattening of the cross occurs for kernels with
sufficiently large mass near the origin, while for kernels that are
sufficiently weak near the origin such a fattening phenomenon does not occur.
  We also provide some further results in the case of the fractional mean
curvature flow, showing that strictly starshaped sets have a unique geometric
evolution.
  Moreover, we exhibit two illustrative examples of closed nonregular curves,
the first with a Lipschitz-type singularity and the second with a cusp-type
singularity, given by two tangent circles of equal radius, whose evolution
develops fattening in the first case, and is uniquely defined in the second,
thus remarking the high sensitivity of the fattening phenomenon in terms of the
regularity of the initial datum. The latter example is in striking contrast to
the classical case of the (local) curvature flow, where two tangent circles
always develop fattening.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we provide also a simple proof of the fact
that the cross is not a $K$-minimal set for the nonlocal perimeter functional

correct despite loss of power. This has sparked a line of research into
algorithms that can recover from a system crash. Since caches are expected to
remain volatile, concurrent data structures and algorithms must be redesigned
to guarantee that they are left in a consistent state after a system crash, and
that the execution can be continued upon recovery. However, the prospect of
redesigning every concurrent data structure or algorithm before it can be used

  In this paper, we present a construction that takes any concurrent program
with reads, writes and CASs to shared memory and makes it persistent, i.e., can
be continued after one or more processes fault and have to restart. Importantly
the converted algorithm has constant computational delay (preserves instruction
counts on each process within a constant factor), as well as constant recovery
delay (a process can recover from a fault in a constant number of
instructions). We show this first for a simple transformation, and then present
optimizations to make it more practical, allowing for a tradeoff for better
constant factors in computational delay, for sometimes increased recovery
delay. We also provide an optimized transformation that works for any

exponential decay of the intermediate scattering functions and a
super-diffusive behavior of the mean-squared displacement. These intriguing
features are explained in terms of the complex interplay between particle
deformations and dynamic heterogeneities, which give rise to persistent motion

was also found orbiting the primary star at $\sim$14 au. This study aims to
better characterize this companion, which could help explain its impact on the
peculiar geometry of the disk. We observed the source with VLT/SINFONI in
$H$+$K$ band in pupil-tracking mode. Data were post-processed with several
algorithms based on angular differential imaging (ADI). HD 142527 B is
conspicuously re-detected in most spectral channels, which enables us to
extract the first medium-resolution spectrum of a low-mass companion within
0.1'' from its central star. Fitting our spectrum with both template and
synthetic spectra suggests that the companion is a young M2.5$\pm$1.0 star with
an effective temperature of $3500\pm100$ K, possibly surrounded with a hot
(1700 K) circum-secondary environment. Pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks
provide a mass estimate of $0.34\pm0.06 M_{\odot}$, independent of the presence
of a hot environment. However, the estimated stellar radius and age do depend
on that assumption; we find a radius of $1.37 \pm 0.05 R_{\odot}$ (resp. $1.96
\pm 0.10 R_{\odot}$) and an age of $1.8^{+1.2}_{-0.5}$ Myr (resp. $0.75 \pm
0.25$ Myr) in the case of the presence (resp. absence) of a hot environment
contributing in $H$+$K$. Our new values for the mass and radius yield a mass
accretion rate of $\sim$5 $\times 10^{-9} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (2-3% that of
the primary). Our results illustrate thus the potential for SINFONI+ADI to
characterize faint close-in companions. The new spectral type makes HD 142527 B
a twin of the well known TW Hya T-Tauri star, and the revision of its mass to
higher values further supports its role in shaping the disk.

driving tasks, it is important to encode the relevant CAN bus sensor data in a
way that captures the general state of the vehicle in a compact form. In this
paper, we develop a deep learning-based method, called Drive2Vec, for embedding
such sensor data in a low-dimensional yet actionable form. Our method is based
on stacked gated recurrent units (GRUs). It accepts a short interval of
automobile sensor data as input and computes a low-dimensional representation
of that data, which can then be used to accurately solve a range of tasks. With
this representation, we (1) predict the exact values of the sensors in the
short term (up to three seconds in the future), (2) forecast the long-term
average values of these same sensors, (3) infer additional contextual
information that is not encoded in the data, including the identity of the
driver behind the wheel, and (4) build a knowledge base that can be used to
auto-label data and identify risky states. We evaluate our approach on a
dataset collected by Audi, which equipped a fleet of test vehicles with data
loggers to store all sensor readings on 2,098 hours of driving on real roads.
We show in several experiments that our method outperforms other baselines by
up to 90%, and we further demonstrate how these embeddings of sensor data can
be used to solve a variety of real-world automotive applications.

determine the pion's $l_z=0$ and $|l_z|=1$ leading Fock-state light-front wave
functions (LFWFs) [labeled by $\psi_{l_z}(x,k_T^2)$]. The leading-twist
time-reversal even transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function
(TMD) of the pion is then directly obtained from these LFWFs. A key
characteristic of the LFWFs, which is driven by dynamical chiral symmetry
breaking, is that at typical hadronic scales they are broad functions in the
light-cone momentum fraction $x$. The LFWFs have a non-trivial $(x,k_T^2)$
dependence and in general do not factorize into separate functions of each
variable. The $l_z=0$ LFWF is concave with a maximum at $x=1/2$, whereas
orbital angular momentum effects causes the $|l_z|=1$ LFWF to have a slight
{\it double-humped} structure for quark transverse momentum in the range $0.5
\lesssim k_T^2 \lesssim 5\,$GeV$^2$. For $k_T^2 \lesssim 1\,$GeV$^2$ the
$k_T^2$ dependence of the LFWFs is well described by a Gaussian, however for
$k_T^2 \gtrsim 10\,$GeV$^2$ these LFWFs behave as $\psi_0 \propto x(1-x)/k_T^2$
and $\psi_1 \propto x(1-x)/k_T^4$, and therefore exhibit the power-law behavior
predicted by perturbative QCD. The pion's TMD inherits many features from the
LFWFs, where for $k_T^2 \lesssim 1\,$GeV$^2$ the $k_T^2$ dependence is well
described by a Gaussian, and for large $k_T^2$ the TMD behaves as $f_\pi^q
\propto x^2(1-x)^2/k_T^4$. At the model scale we find the average transverse
momentum, defined by a Bessel-weighted moment with $b_T=0.3\,$fm, to equal
$\langle k_T^2\rangle = 0.19\,$GeV$^2$. The TMD evolution of our result is
studied using both the $b^*$ and $\zeta$ prescriptions which allows a
qualitative comparison with existing Drell-Yan data.

point sources within a box due to a specific boundary condition which can be
non-periodic. The HSMA first introduces an auxiliary surface such that the
contribution of images outside the surface can be approximated by the

so-called harmonic surface mapping is the procedure to transform the
approximate solution into a surface charge and a surface dipole over the

The mapping procedure is independent of the number of the sources and is
considered to have a low complexity. The electrostatic interactions are then
among those charges within the surface and at the integration points, which are
all the form of Coulomb potential and can be accelerated straightforwardly by
the fast multipole method to achieve linear scaling. Numerical calculations of
the Madelung constant of a crystalline lattice, electrostatic energy of ions in

the HSMA is accurate and fast, and thus is attractive for many applications.

a more refined approach, in the presence of a bialgebra modality, used a
codereliction. The latter approach is particularly relevant to linear logic
settings, where the coalgebra modality is monoidal and the Seely isomorphisms
give rise to a bialgebra modality. Here, we prove that these apparently
distinct notions of differentiation, in the presence of a monoidal coalgebra
modality, are completely equivalent. Thus, for linear logic settings, there is
only one notion of differentiation.
  This paper also presents a number of separating examples for coalgebra
modalities including examples which are and are not monoidal, as well as
examples which do and do not support differential structure. Of particular
interest is the observation that -- somewhat counter-intuitively --
differential algebras never induce a differential category although they
provide a monoidal coalgebra modality. On the other hand, Rota-Baxter algebras
-- which are usually associated with integration -- provide an example of a
differential category which has a non-monoidal coalgebra modality.

enable learning methods to address the curse of dimensionality. However,
existing unsupervised representation learning methods mainly focus on
preserving the data regularity information and learning the representations
independently of subsequent outlier detection methods, which can result in
suboptimal and unstable performance of detecting irregularities (i.e.,
outliers).
  This paper introduces a ranking model-based framework, called RAMODO, to
address this issue. RAMODO unifies representation learning and outlier
detection to learn low-dimensional representations that are tailored for a
state-of-the-art outlier detection approach - the random distance-based
approach. This customized learning yields more optimal and stable
representations for the targeted outlier detectors. Additionally, RAMODO can
leverage little labeled data as prior knowledge to learn more expressive and
application-relevant representations. We instantiate RAMODO to an efficient
method called REPEN to demonstrate the performance of RAMODO.
  Extensive empirical results on eight real-world ultrahigh dimensional data
sets show that REPEN (i) enables a random distance-based detector to obtain
significantly better AUC performance and two orders of magnitude speedup; (ii)
performs substantially better and more stably than four state-of-the-art
representation learning methods; and (iii) leverages less than 1% labeled data
to achieve up to 32% AUC improvement.

homologous series of linear alkanes are used as the property of interest. The
training data are chemically accurate, i.e., they have very low uncertainty by
the standards of computational chemistry. The analysis does not find evidence
of PM7 consistency with the entire data set considered as no single set of
parameter values is found that captures the experimental uncertainties of all
training data. Nevertheless, PM7 is found to be consistent for subsets of the
training data. In such cases, uncertainty propagation from the chemically
accurate training data to the predicted values preserves error within bounds of
chemical accuracy if predictions are made for the molecules of comparable size.
Otherwise, the error grows linearly with the relative size of the molecules.

information retrieval (IR) tasks. However, neural approaches often require
large volumes of training data to perform effectively, which is not always
available. To mitigate the shortage of labeled data, training neural IR models
with weak supervision has been recently proposed and received considerable
attention in the literature. In weak supervision, an existing model
automatically generates labels for a large set of unlabeled data, and a machine
learning model is further trained on the generated ""weak"" data. Surprisingly,
it has been shown in prior art that the trained neural model can outperform the
weak labeler by a significant margin. Although these obtained improvements have
been intuitively justified in previous work, the literature still lacks
theoretical justification for the observed empirical findings. In this position
paper, we propose to theoretically study weak supervision, in particular for IR
tasks, e.g., learning to rank. We briefly review a set of our recent
theoretical findings that shed light on learning from weakly supervised data,
and provide guidelines on how train learning to rank models with weak

individual privacy. Many applications, in medical / pharmaceutical domains or
social networks, rather posit privacy at a group level, a setting we call
integral privacy. We aim for the strongest form of privacy: the group size is
in particular not known in advance. We study a problem with related
applications in domains cited above that have recently met with substantial
recent press: sampling.
  Keeping correct utility levels in such a strong model of statistical
indistinguishability looks difficult to be achieved with the usual differential
privacy toolbox because it would typically scale in the worst case the
sensitivity by the sample size and so the noise variance by up to its square.
We introduce a trick specific to sampling that bypasses the sensitivity
analysis. Privacy enforces an information theoretic barrier on approximation,
and we show how to reach this barrier with guarantees on the approximation of
the target non private density. We do so using a recent approach to non private
density estimation relying on the original boosting theory, learning the
sufficient statistics of an exponential family with classifiers. Approximation
guarantees cover the mode capture problem. In the context of learning, the
sampling problem is particularly important: because integral privacy enjoys the
same closure under post-processing as differential privacy does, any algorithm
using integrally privacy sampled data would result in an output equally
integrally private. We also show that this brings fairness guarantees on
post-processing that would eventually elude classical differential privacy: any
decision process has bounded data-dependent bias when the data is integrally
privately sampled. Experimental results against private kernel density
estimation and private GANs displays the quality of our results.

Significant progress has been made in algorithm development and resource

well-designed keyword search and rule-based systems often achieve good
performance. However, the construction of keyword and rule lists requires
significant manual effort, which is difficult to scale. Supervised machine

classification patterns and structures from data. Recently, deep learning and
unsupervised learning have received growing attention, with the former favored

Integrating heterogeneous data sources have become increasingly important and
have shown promise in improving model performance. Often better performance is
achieved by combining multiple modalities of information. Despite these many

system Terzan 5 (Ter 5) harbours multiple populations of stars. Several models
have attempted to interpret the large age difference of several Gyrs between
the dominant populations, but none have been universally accepted. We propose a
new scenario whereby a collision between a metal-poor Ter 5 and a giant
molecular cloud (GMC) serves as a catalyst for the generation of a super-solar
population of stars. Using numerical simulations of this new ""GC-GMC"" collision
scenario we demonstrate that, within a time frame of several Gyrs, our
synthetic Ter 5 was capable of interacting with a metal-rich GMC in the central
region of the Galaxy. As a consequence of this, our simulated globular cluster
(GC) is able to capture enough gas from the colliding GMC to form a new
population of metal-rich stars. Furthermore, the younger population created
from the high-density regions of the captured gas is shown to have a stronger
central mass concentration than the older metal-poor one, which is consistent
with observations. A chemical link between Ter 5 and the bulge population of
the Milky Way has long been observed and these simulations finally provide
evidence for their similarities. Our model rationalises the 5 Gyrs of
quiescence observed between the two dominant populations of Ter 5 and justifies
the existence of the young generation. We discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of the new scenario in the context of the observed physical
properties of Ter 5.

Galaxy is still under debate. We report new observational constraints on the
gaseous halo using 107 lines-of-sight of the Suzaku X-ray observations at
$75^{\circ}<l<285^{\circ}$ and $|b|>15^{\circ}$ with a total exposure of 6.4
Ms. The gaseous halo spectra are represented by a single-temperature plasma
model in collisional ionization equilibrium. The median temperature of the
observed fields is 0.26 keV ($3.0\times10^6$ K) with a typical fluctuation of
$\sim30$%. The emission measure varies by an order of magnitude and marginally
correlates with the Galactic latitude. Despite the large scatter of the data,
the emission measure distribution is roughly reproduced by a disk-like density
distribution with a scale length of $\sim7$ kpc, a scale height of $\sim2$ kpc,
and a total mass of $\sim5\times10^7$ $M_{\odot}$. In addition, we found that a
spherical hot gas with the $\beta$-model profile hardly contributes to the
observed X-rays but that its total mass might reach $\gtrsim10^9$ $M_{\odot}$.
Combined with indirect evidence of an extended gaseous halo from other
observations, the hot gaseous halo likely consists of a dense disk-like
component and a rarefied spherical component; the X-ray emissions primarily
come from the former but the mass is dominated by the latter. The disk-like
component likely originates from stellar feedback in the Galactic disk due to
the low scale height and the large scatter of the emission measures. The median
[O/Fe] of $\sim0.25$ shows the contribution of the core-collapse supernovae and
supports the stellar feedback origin.

HOIPs are smaller than that of conventional covalently bonded 2D materials.
Both the Young's modulus and breaking strength first decrease and then plateau
as the thickness increases from monolayer to 4 layers due to interlayer
slippage during deformation. Our results show that ultrathin 2D HOIPs exhibit
outstanding breaking strength/Young's Modulus ratio compared to many other
widely used engineering materials and polymeric flexible substrates, which

reallocation of existing tasks. CBBA with Partial Replanning (CBBA-PR) enables
the team to trade-off between convergence time and increased coordination by
resetting a portion of their previous allocation at every round of bidding on
tasks. By resetting the last tasks allocated by each agent, we are able to
ensure the convergence of the team to a conflict-free solution. CBBA-PR can be
further improved by reducing the team size involved in the replanning, further
reducing the communication burden of the team and runtime of CBBA-PR. Finally,
we validate the faster convergence and improved solution quality of CBBA-PR in

classification tasks, accuracy is the most commonly used as a measure of
classifier performance. In some applications such as anomaly detection and
diagnostic testing, accuracy is not an appropriate measure since prior
probabilties are often greatly biased. Although in such cases the pAUC has been
utilized as a performance measure, few methods have been proposed for directly
maximizing the pAUC. This optimization is achieved by using a scoring function.
The conventional approach utilizes a linear function as the scoring function.
In contrast we newly introduce nonlinear scoring functions for this purpose.
Specifically, we present two types of nonlinear scoring functions based on
generative models and deep neural networks. We show experimentally that
nonlinear scoring fucntions improve the conventional methods through the
application of a binary classification of real and bogus objects obtained with

realize interpretable and customized fashion outfit compositions, we propose a

an auto-encoder module, a supervised attributes module and a multi-independent

the embedding. In the supervised attributes module, multiple attributes labels
are adopted to ensure that different parts of the overall embedding correspond
to different attributes. In the multi-independent module, adversarial operation
are adopted to fulfill the mutually independent constraint. With the
interpretable and partitioned embedding, we then construct an outfit
composition graph and an attribute matching map. Given specified attributes

this paper, we propose a new Android malware detection approach based on deep
learning and static analysis. Instead of using Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs) only, we further analyze the source code of Android

harder for attackers to evade detection. In particular, we use a call graph
from method invocations in an Android application to represent the application,
and further analyze method attributes to form a structured Program

malware or not. To efficiently train such a graph convolutional network, we
propose a batch training scheme that allows multiple heterogeneous graphs to be

graph representation learning for malware detection. We conduct extensive

basic security research problem. State-of-the-art approaches rely on a large

from three key limitations: 1) it is time-consuming and costly to manually
label a large training set, 2) they cannot detect new Sybils in a timely
fashion, and 3) they are vulnerable to Sybil attacks that leverage information
of the training set. In this work, we propose SybilBlind, a structure-based
Sybil detection framework that does not rely on a manually labeled training
set. SybilBlind works under the same threat model as state-of-the-art
structure-based methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SybilBlind using
1) a social network with synthetic Sybils and 2) two Twitter datasets with real
Sybils. For instance, SybilBlind achieves an AUC of 0.98 on a Twitter dataset.

the zero temperature $\lambda-x$ phase diagram of the model. It is argued that
all underdoped cuprates are close to the quantum tricritical point $x=0$,
$\lambda=1$. The three phases ""meet"" at the tricritical point: (i) N\'eel

CNN use convolutional layers to focus on the local connectivity of the

this work we propose Double Path Networks for Sequence to Sequence learning

deeply integrating the two paths with cross attention, both types of

an inverted Y-shaped ends. The \emph{IRIS} 1400 \AA\ observations show that the
plasma blobs were ejected from the tip of the Y-shaped ends of the sheet-like
structure. Obvious photospheric magnetic flux cancellation occurred after the
first loop-loop interaction and continued until the end of the observation.
Complemented by the nonlinear force-free field extrapolation, we found that two
sets of magnetic field lines, which reveal an X-shaped configuration, align
well with the interacted coronal loops. Moreover, a magnetic null point is
found to be situated at about $0.9$ Mm height right above the flux cancellation
sites and located between the two sets of magnetic field lines. These results
suggest that the flux cancellation might be a result of submergence of magnetic
field lines following magnetic reconnection that occurs in the lower atmosphere
of the Sun, and the ejected plasma blobs should be plasmoids created in the
sheet-like structure due to the tearing-mode instability. This observation
reveals detailed magnetic field structure and dynamic process above the flux
cancellation sites and will help us to understand magnetic reconnection in the
lower atmosphere of the Sun.

stimulates an additional quantum of energy from an atom into the same
electromagnetic mode as the impinging photon. Hence, the two outgoing photons
are identical. In a waveguide or free space, this intuition is typically found
through Fermi's Golden rule, however, this does not properly account for the
wave-like nature of the photons. Here, I present an exact solution to
stimulated emission from a quantum two-level atom that properly accounts for
the incoming and outgoing electromagnetic modes. This result is valid over a
huge range of incident photon numbers. For a single incident photon, it shows
how the photon must properly mode match the two-level system to cause
stimulated emission. For a Fock state drive with large photon number, the exact
solution shows how a two-level system Rabi oscillates with the traveling Fock
mode as it passes by. I additionally use the same formalism to show that
stimulated emission by a coherent pulse cannot be understood as an additional
photon being emitted into the incident coherent state because the two-level
system's state factorizes with the electromagnetic field's coherent state.
Recent advances in superconducting circuits make them an ideal platform to test
these predictions.

Expression patterns of specific marker genes have been used to characterize

based on the whole gene expression profiles (GEPs). The accuracies of simple
classification algorithms such as linear discriminators or support vector
machines are limited due to the complexity of biological systems. We used deep
neural networks to analyze 1040 GEPs from 16 different human tissues and cell
types. After comparing different architectures, we identified a specific
structure of deep autoencoders that can encode a GEP into a vector of 30
numeric values, which we call the cell identity code (CIC). The original GEP
can be reproduced from the CIC with an accuracy comparable to technical
replicates of the same experiment. Although we use an unsupervised approach to
train the autoencoder, we show different values of the CIC are connected to
different biological aspects of the cell, such as different pathways or
biological processes. This network can use CIC to reproduce the GEP of the cell
types it has never seen during the training. It also can resist some noise in
the measurement of the GEP. Furthermore, we introduce classifier autoencoder,
an architecture that can accurately identify cell type based on the GEP or the
CIC.

molecular mesowire crystal can be utilized to systematically vary the
directionality of second harmonic generation (SHG) in the forward scattering
geometry. We demonstrate this capability on crystalline diamonoanthraquinone
(DAAQ) mesowires with subwavelength facets. We observed that the radial angles
of the SHG emission can be tuned over a range of 130 degrees. This angular
variation arises due to spatially distributed nonlinear dipoles in the focal
volume of the excitation as well as the geometrical cross-section and facet
orientation of the mesowire. Numerical simulations of the near-field excitation
profile corroborate the role of the mesowire geometry in localizing the
electric field. In addition to directional SHG from the mesowire, we
experimentally observe optical waveguiding of the nonlinear two-photon excited
fluorescence (TPEF). Interestingly, we observed that for a given pump
excitation, the TPEF signal is isotropic and delocalized, whereas the SHG
emission is directional and localized at the location of excitation. All the

  for Distant Conversational Speech Recognition","to appear in Interspeech 2018",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The current trend in automatic speech recognition is to leverage large
amounts of labeled data to train supervised neural network models.
Unfortunately, obtaining data for a wide range of domains to train robust
models can be costly. However, it is relatively inexpensive to collect large
amounts of unlabeled data from domains that we want the models to generalize
to. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised adaptation method that
learns to synthesize labeled data for the target domain from unlabeled
in-domain data and labeled out-of-domain data. We first learn without
supervision an interpretable latent representation of speech that encodes
linguistic and nuisance factors (e.g., speaker and channel) using different
latent variables. To transform a labeled out-of-domain utterance without
altering its transcript, we transform the latent nuisance variables while
maintaining the linguistic variables. To demonstrate our approach, we focus on
a channel mismatch setting, where the domain of interest is distant
conversational speech, and labels are only available for close-talking speech.
Our proposed method is evaluated on the AMI dataset, outperforming all
baselines and bridging the gap between unadapted and in-domain models by over
77% without using any parallel data.

  for IoT Networks",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimal data aggregation aimed at maximizing IoT network lifetime by
minimizing constrained on-board resource utilization continues to be a
challenging task. The existing data aggregation methods have proven that
compressed sensing is promising for data aggregation. However, they compromise
either on energy efficiency or recovery fidelity and require complex on-node
computations. In this paper, we propose a novel Light Weight Compressed Data
Aggregation (LWCDA) algorithm that randomly divides the entire network into
non-overlapping clusters for data aggregation. The random non-overlapping
clustering offers two important advantages: 1) energy efficiency, as each node
has to send its measurement only to its cluster head, 2) highly sparse
measurement matrix, which leads to a practically implementable framework with
low complexity. We analyze the properties of our measurement matrix using
restricted isometry property, the associated coherence and phase transition.
Through extensive simulations on practical data, we show that the measurement
matrix can reconstruct data with high fidelity. Further, we demonstrate that
the LWCDA algorithm reduces transmission cost significantly against baseline
approaches, implying thereby the enhancement of the network lifetime.

individuals in situations such as the cocktail party scenario. The performance
of the current hearing aid technology has been observed to be limited in these
scenarios. In this paper, we propose a binaural speech enhancement framework
that takes into consideration the speech production model. The enhancement
framework proposed here is based on the Kalman filter that allows us to take
the speech production dynamics into account during the enhancement process. The
usage of a Kalman filter requires the estimation of clean speech and noise
short term predictor (STP) parameters, and the clean speech pitch parameters.
In this work, a binaural codebook-based method is proposed for estimating the
STP parameters, and a directional pitch estimator based on the harmonic model
and maximum likelihood principle is used to estimate the pitch parameters. The
proposed method for estimating the STP and pitch parameters jointly uses the
information from left and right ears, leading to a more robust estimation of
the filter parameters. Objective measures such as PESQ and STOI have been used
to evaluate the enhancement framework in different acoustic scenarios
representative of the cocktail party scenario. We have also conducted
subjective listening tests on a set of nine normal hearing subjects, to
evaluate the performance in terms of intelligibility and quality improvement.
The listening tests show that the proposed algorithm, even with access to only
a single channel noisy observation, significantly improves the overall speech
quality, and the speech intelligibility by up to 15%.

drive powerful equatorial disc winds. A simple mechanism for driving such
outflows involves X-ray heating of the top of the disc atmosphere to the
Compton temperature. Beyond the Compton radius, the thermal speed exceeds the
escape velocity, and mass loss is inevitable. Here, we present the first
coupled radiation-hydrodynamic simulation of such thermally-driven disc winds.
The main advance over previous modelling efforts is that the
frequency-dependent attenuation of the irradiating SED is taken into account.
We can therefore relax the approximation that the wind is optically thin
throughout which is unlikely to hold in the crucial acceleration zone of the
flow. The main remaining limitations of our simulations are connected to our
treatment of optically thick regions. Adopting parameters representative of the
wind-driving LMXB GRO~J1655-40, our radiation-hydrodynamic model yields a
mass-loss rate that is $\simeq5\times$ lower than that suggested by pure
hydrodynamic, optically thin models. This outflow rate still represents more
than twice the accretion rate and agrees well with the mass-loss rate inferred
from Chandra/HETG observations of GRO~J1655-40 at a time when the system had a
similar luminosity to that adopted in our simulations. The Fe XXV and Fe XXVI
Lyman $\rm{\alpha}~$ absorption line profiles observed in this state are
slightly stronger than those predicted by our simulations but the qualitative
agreement between observed and simulated outflow properties means that thermal
driving is a viable mechanism for powering the disc winds seen in soft-state
LMXBs.

analysis, for each type of immersion, we split the supermanifold into its
Grassmannian components and study separately each manifold generated. Even
though we consider four variables in the Euclidean case, we obtain that the
structural equations of each manifold are linked with the Gauss--Codazzi
equations of a surface immersed in a Euclidean or spherical space. In the
hyperbolic and spherical superspaces, we find that the body manifolds are
linked with the classical Gauss--Codazzi equations for a surface immersed in
hyperbolic and spherical spaces, respectively. For some soul manifolds, we show
that the immersion of the manifolds must be in a hyperbolic space and that the
structural equations split into two cases. In one case, the structural
equations reduce to the Liouville equation, which can be completely solved. In
the other case, we can express the geometric quantities solely in terms of the
metric coefficients, which provide a geometric characterization of the
structural equations in terms of functions linked with the Hopf differential,
the mean curvature and a new function which does not appear in the

of complexity. The bottom level contains the basic building blocks of music,

from combining the basic blocks: tonal and rhythmic stability, harmonic and
rhythmic complexity, etc. High-level descriptors (genre, mood, expressive
style) are usually modeled using the lower level ones. The features belonging
to the middle level can both improve automatic recognition of high-level

extracted from the data of ALICE experiment and the methods used are
Multifractal-Detrended-Fluctuation-Analysis(MF-DFA), and a rigorous
chaos-based, complex-network based method - Visibility-Graph(VG) analysis. The
fractal behavior of pionisation process is studied by utilizing MF-DFA method
for extracting the Hurst exponent and Multifractal-spectrum-width to analyze
the scale-freeness and fractality inherent in the fluctuation pattern of eta.
Then VG method is used to analyze the fluctuation from a completely different
perspective of complex network. This algorithm's scale-freeness detection
mechanism to extract the Power-of-Scale-freeness-of-Visibility-Graph(PSVG),
re-establishes the scale-freeness and fractality. Earlier, it has been shown
that the scaling behavior is different from one
hadron-nucleus($\pi^{-}$-AgBr(350 GeV)) to one
nucleus-nucleus($^{32}$S-AgBr(200 A GeV)) interaction which is of comparatively
higher total energy. In this work, we have compared the fluctuation pattern in
terms of 3 rigorous parameters - Multifractal-spectrum-width, Hurst exponent
and PSVG, between Pb-Pb(2.76TeV per nucleon pair) data and either of
$\pi^{-}$-AgBr(350 GeV) or $^{32}$S-AgBr(200 A GeV) data, where both the
interaction data are of significantly less energy than the ALICE data. We found
that the values of the 3 parameters are substantially different for ALICE data
compared to the other two interaction data. As remarkably different value of
long-range-correlation indicates phase-transition, similar change in the
fluctuation pattern in terms of these parameters can be attributed to a
phase-transition and also the onset of QGP.

This provides a sound theoretical justification for describing such

the cofactor fields appearing in the homogenization integrals. Thereby, we
identify those parts of the metamaterial structures which are critical for the
observed effective metamaterial parameters, providing a unified view onto
various previously introduced single-constituent/multiple-constituent and
isotropic/anisotropic architectures, respectively. Third, we suggest a novel
three-dimensional non-magnetic metamaterial architecture exhibiting a sign
reversal of the effective isotropic Hall coefficient. It is conceptually
distinct from the original chainmail-like geometry, for which the sign reversal
is based on interlinked rings. Fourth, we discuss two examples for metamaterial

the sign of the isotropic Hall coefficient and an approach to conceptually
break previous bounds for the effective mobility.

scheme for hybrid millimeter wave (mmWave) systems and study its resource
allocation. A beam splitting technique is designed to generate multiple analog
beams to serve multiple users for NOMA transmission. Compared to conventional
mmWave orthogonal multiple access (mmWave-OMA) schemes, the proposed scheme can
serve more than one user on each radio frequency (RF) chain. Besides, in
contrast to the recently proposed single-beam mmWave-NOMA scheme which can only
serve multiple NOMA users within the same beam, the proposed scheme can perform
NOMA transmission for the users with an arbitrary angle-of-departure (AOD)
distribution. This provides a higher flexibility for applying NOMA in mmWave
communications and thus can efficiently exploit the potential multi-user
diversity. Then, we design a suboptimal two-stage resource allocation for
maximizing the system sum-rate. In the first stage, assuming that only analog
beamforming is available, a user grouping and antenna allocation algorithm is
proposed to maximize the conditional system sum-rate based on the coalition
formation game theory. In the second stage, with the zero-forcing (ZF) digital
precoder, a suboptimal solution is devised to solve a non-convex power
allocation optimization problem for the maximization of the system sum-rate
which takes into account the quality of service (QoS) constraint. Simulation
results show that our designed resource allocation can achieve a
close-to-optimal performance in each stage. In addition, we demonstrate that
the proposed multi-beam mmWave-NOMA scheme offers a higher spectral efficiency
than that of the single-beam mmWave-NOMA and the mmWave-OMA schemes.

dissipative medium to a distant perturbation, and investigate its dynamics
under delayed feedback control. The time a perturbation needs to propagate to a
measurement point is captured by an inherent delay time (or latency). A
detailed linear stability analysis demonstrates that a non-zero system delay
acts destabilizing on the otherwise stable fixed point for sufficiently large
feedback strengths. The imaginary part of the dominant eigenvalue is bounded by
twice the feedback strength. In the relevant parameter space it changes
discontinuously along specific lines when switching between branches of
eigenvalues. When the feedback control force is bounded by a sigmoid function,
a supercritical Hopf bifurcation occurs at the stability-instability
transition. The frequency and amplitude of the resulting limit cycles respond
to parameter changes like the dominant eigenvalue. In particular, they show
similar discontinuities along specific lines. These results are largely
independent of the exact shape of the sigmoid function. Our findings match well
with previously reported results on a feedback-induced instability of vortex
diffusion in a rotationally driven Newtonian fluid [M. Zeitz, P. Gurevich, and

well-established set of editing rules, called continuity editing, to create a
sense of situational continuity. Despite massive changes in visual content
across cuts, viewers in general experience no trouble perceiving the
discontinuous flow of information as a coherent set of events. However, Virtual
Reality (VR) movies are intrinsically different from traditional movies in that
the viewer controls the camera orientation at all times. As a consequence,
common editing techniques that rely on camera orientations, zooms, etc., cannot
be used. In this paper we investigate key relevant questions to understand how
well traditional movie editing carries over to VR. To do so, we rely on recent
cognition studies and the event segmentation theory, which states that our
brains segment continuous actions into a series of discrete, meaningful events.
We first replicate one of these studies to assess whether the predictions of
such theory can be applied to VR. We next gather gaze data from viewers
watching VR videos containing different edits with varying parameters, and
provide the first systematic analysis of viewers' behavior and the perception
of continuity in VR. From this analysis we make a series of relevant findings;
for instance, our data suggests that predictions from the cognitive event
segmentation theory are useful guides for VR editing; that different types of
edits are equally well understood in terms of continuity; and that spatial
misalignments between regions of interest at the edit boundaries favor a more
exploratory behavior even after viewers have fixated on a new region of
interest. In addition, we propose a number of metrics to describe viewers'
attentional behavior in VR. We believe the insights derived from our work can
be useful as guidelines for VR content creation.

resolution: when capturing videos of high temporal resolution, the spatial
resolution decreases due to bandwidth limitations in the capture system.
Achieving both high spatial and temporal resolution is only possible with
highly specialized and very expensive hardware, and even then the same basic
trade-off remains. The recent introduction of compressive sensing and sparse
reconstruction techniques allows for the capture of single-shot high-speed
video, by coding the temporal information in a single frame, and then
reconstructing the full video sequence from this single coded image and a
trained dictionary of image patches. In this paper, we first analyze this
approach, and find insights that help improve the quality of the reconstructed
videos. We then introduce a novel technique, based on convolutional sparse
coding (CSC), and show how it outperforms the state-of-the-art, patch-based
approach in terms of flexibility and efficiency, due to the convolutional
nature of its filter banks. The key idea for CSC high-speed video acquisition
is extending the basic formulation by imposing an additional constraint in the
temporal dimension, which enforces sparsity of the first-order derivatives over
time.

multiple quantities (or resources) are present, and their interplay governs the
evolution of physical systems. We derive conditions for the interconversion of
these resources, which generalise the first law of thermodynamics. We study
reversibility conditions for multi-resource theories, and find that the
relative entropy distances from the invariant sets of the theory play a
fundamental role in the quantification of the resources. The first law for
general multi-resource theories is a single relation which links the change in
the properties of the system during a state transformation and the weighted sum
of the resources exchanged. In fact, this law can be seen as relating the
change in the relative entropy from different sets of states. In contrast to
typical single-resource theories, the notion of free states and invariant sets
of states become distinct in light of multiple constraints. Additionally,
generalisations of the Helmholtz free energy, and of adiabatic and isothermal
transformations, emerge. We thus have a set of laws for general quantum
resource theories, which generalise the laws of thermodynamics. We first test
this approach on thermodynamics with multiple conservation laws, and then apply
it to the theory of local operations under energetic restrictions.

populations of disk-bearing young stellar objects. These have provided crucial
constraints, such as the timescale of dispersal of protoplanetary disks,
obtained by carefully combining infrared data with spectroscopic or X-ray data.
While observations in various regions agree with the general trend of
decreasing disk fraction with age, the Lupus V and VI regions appeared to have
been at odds, having an extremely low disk fraction. Here we show, using the
recent Gaia data release 2 (DR2), that these extremely low disk fractions are
actually due to a very high contamination by background giants. Out of the 83
candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) in these clouds observed by Gaia, only
five have distances of 150 pc, similar to YSOs in the other Lupus clouds, and
have similar proper motions to other members in this star-forming complex. Of
these five targets, four have optically thick (Class II) disks. On the one
hand, this result resolves the conundrum of the puzzling low disk fraction in
these clouds, while, on the other hand, it further clarifies the need to
confirm the Spitzer selected diskless population with other tracers, especially
in regions at low galactic latitude like Lupus V and VI. The use of Gaia
astrometry is now an independent and reliable way to further assess the
membership of candidate YSOs in these, and potentially other, star-forming
regions.

thermal bath, is driven by fluctuating forces which stem from active processes
in the system, such as self-propulsion or collisions with other active
particles. These active fluctuations do not fulfill a fluctuation-dissipation
relation and therefore play the role of a non-equilibrium environment, which
keeps the system permanently out of thermal equilibrium even in the absence of
external forces. We investigate how the out-of-equilibrium character of the
active matter system and the associated irreversibility is reflected in the
trajectories of the Brownian particle. Specifically, we analyze the log-ratio
of path probabilities for observing a certain particle trajectory forward in
time versus observing its time-reversed twin trajectory. For passive Brownian
motion, it is well-known that this path probability ratio quantifies
irreversibility in terms of entropy production. For active Brownian motion, we
show that in addition to the usual entropy produced in the thermal environment
the path probability ratio contains a contribution to irreversibility from
mutual information production between the particle trajectory and the history
of the non-equilibrium environment. The resulting irreversibility measure
fulfills an integral fluctuation theorem and a second-law like relation. When
deriving and discussing these relations, we keep in mind that the active
fluctuations can occur either due to a suspension of active particles pushing
around a passive colloid or due to active self-propulsion of the particle
itself; we point out the similarities and differences between these two
situations. We obtain explicit expressions for active fluctuations modeled by
an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Finally, we illustrate our general results by
analyzing a Brownian particle which is trapped in a static or moving harmonic
potential.

volume method for modeling complex free surface flows at the aid of a simple
diffuse interface method. The employed physical model is a two-phase model
derived from the Baer-Nunziato system for compressible multi-phase flows. In
particular, as proposed for the first time in Dumbser (2011), the number of
equations is reduced from seven to three by assuming that the relative pressure
of the gas with respect to the atmospheric reference pressure is zero, and that
the gas momentum is negligible compared to the one of the liquid. The two-phase
model does not make any of the classical assumptions of shallow water type
systems, hence it does not neglect vertical accelerations and the free surface
is not constraint to be a single-valued function, so even complex shapes as
those of breaking waves can be properly captured. The resulting PDE system is
solved by a novel well balanced path-conservative finite volume method on
structured Cartesian grids, which is able to preserve exactly the equilibrium
states even in the presence of obstacles. It furthermore automatically computes
the location of the water-air interfaces, and assures low numerical dissipation
at the free surface thanks to a novel Osher-Romberg-type Riemann solver.
Finally, high computational performance is guaranteed by an efficient parallel
implementation on a GPU-based platform that reaches the efficiency of twenty
million of volumes processed per seconds and makes it possible to employ even
very fine meshes. The validation of our new well balanced scheme is carried out
by comparing the obtained numerical results against existing analytical,
numerical and experimental reference solutions for a large number of test
cases, among which oscillating elliptical drops, dambreak problems, breaking
waves, over topping weir flows, and wave impact problems.

that certain rollouts, also for networks with only skip and no recurrent

that these early responses have better performance. The streaming rollout
maximizes these properties and enables a fully parallel execution of the
network reducing runtime on massively parallel devices. Finally, we provide an

proper modeling of dispersion and transport in highly obstructed canopy flows.
However, Lagrangian flow measurements demand very high rates of data
acquisition, resulting in bottlenecks that prevented the estimation of
Lagrangian statistics in canopy flows hitherto. We report on a new extension to
the 3D Particle Tracking Velocimetry (3D-PTV) method, featuring real-time
particle segmentation that outputs centroids and sizes of tracer particles and
performed on dedicated hardware during high-speed digital video acquisition
from multiple cameras. The proposed extension results in four orders of
magnitude reduction in data transfer rate that enables to perform substantially
longer experimental runs, facilitating measurements of convergent statistics.
The extended method is demonstrated through an experimental wind tunnel
investigation of the Lagrangian statistics in a heterogeneous canopy flow. We
observe that acceleration statistics are affected by the mean shear at the top
of the canopy layer and that Lagrangian particle dispersion at small scales is
dominated by turbulence in the wake of the roughness elements. This approach
enables to overcome major shortcomings from Eulerian-based measurements which
rely on assumptions such as the Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis, which is
known to fail in highly turbulent flows.

determination of their critical exponents defines a prime benchmark for
complementary theoretical approaches, such as lattice simulations, the
renormalization group and the conformal bootstrap. Despite promising recent
developments in each of these methods, however, no satisfactory consensus on
the fermionic critical exponents has been achieved, so far. Here, we perform a
comprehensive analysis of the Ising Gross-Neveu universality classes based on
the recently achieved four-loop perturbative calculations. We combine the
perturbative series in $4-\epsilon$ spacetime dimensions with the one for the
purely fermionic Gross-Neveu model in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions by employing
polynomial interpolation as well as two-sided Pad\'e approximants. Further, we
provide predictions for the critical exponents exploring various resummation
techniques following the strategies developed for the three-dimensional scalar
$O(n)$ universality classes. We give an exhaustive appraisal of the current
situation of Gross-Neveu universality by comparison to other methods. For large
enough number of spinor components $N\geq 8$ as well as for the case of
emergent supersymmetry $N=1$, we find our renormalization group estimates to be

observed with ALMA. The sample stars are: R Aqr, Mira, W Aql, and pi1 Gru. The
sample covers a range in binary separation and wind properties, where R Aqr is
the source with the smallest separation. The R Aqr binary pair consists of an
M-type AGB star and a white dwarf at a separation of 45 mas, equivalent to
about 10 AU at 218 pc. The aim of the ALMA study is to investigate the
dependence of the wind shaping on the binary separation and to provide
constraints for hydrodynamical binary interaction models. R Aqr is particularly
interesting as the source with the smallest separation and a complex
circumstellar environment that is strongly affected by the interaction between
the two stars and by the high-energy radiation resulting from this interaction
and from the hot white dwarf companion. The CO(J=3-2) line emission has been
observed at 0.5"" spatial resolution. The CO envelope around the binary pair is
marginally resolved, showing what appears to be a rather complex distribution.
The outer radius of the CO emitting region is estimated from the data and found
to be about a factor of 10 larger than previously thought. This implies an
average mass-loss rate during the past 100 yr of 2x10-7 Msun/yr, a factor of 45
less than previous estimates. The channel maps are presented and the molecular
gas distribution is discussed and set into the context of what was previously
known about the system. Additional molecular line emission detected within the
bandwidth covered by the ALMA observations is also presented. Because of the
limited extent of the emission, firm conclusions about the dynamical evolution
of the system will have to wait for higher spatial resolution observations.
However, the data presented here support the assumption that the mass-loss rate
from the Mira star strongly varies and is focused on the orbital plane.

the first and second excited levels, 374 K and 1398 K, and a large mixing
between the +-|5/2> and the -+|1/2> states. This indicates a very strong easy
plane anisotropy with an unusual small c-axis moment. Using the same general
expressions, we show that the properties of the recently reported system
CeCd3As3 can also be described by a similar CEF scheme, providing a much
simpler explanation for its magnetic properties than the initial proposal.

ThCr2Si2-type tetragonal structure after ball-milling leading to a reduction in
particle size, typically falling in the range 10 - 100 nm. We find that there
is a qualitative change in the temperature dependence of magnetic
susceptibility for such small particles, with respect to that known for bulk
form. To understand this microscopically, Mossbauer spectra as a function of
temperature were taken. The Mossbauer spectrum of the nanocrystalline compound
is essentially divalent-like at room temperature, but becomes distinctly
bimodal at all temperatures below 300 K, unlike that of the bulk form. That is,
there is a progressive transfer of intensity from divalent position to
trivalent position with a gradual decrease of temperature. We attribute it to a
first-order valence transition, with extreme broadening by defects in the nano
specimen. Thus, there is a qualitative change in the valence behavior in this

for a wide range of disciplines. Conventionally, the narrow bandwidth is
pursued in an XFEL. However, in recent years, the large-bandwidth XFEL
operation schemes are proposed for X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray
crystallography, in which over-compression is a promising scheme to produce
broad-bandwidth XFEL pulses through increasing the electron beam energy chirp.
In this paper, combining with the beam yaw correction to overcome the
transverse slice misalignment caused by the coherent synchrotron radiation,
finding out the over-compression working point of the linac is treated as a
many-objective (having four or more objectives) optimization problem, thus the
non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III is applied to the beam dynamic
optimization for the first time. Start-to-end simulations demonstrate a full
bandwidth of 4.6% for Shanghai soft x-ray free-electron laser user facility.

manifold embedded in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. We first analyze
kernel-based algorithms and show that under the usual regularizations,
non-probabilistic methods cannot recover the differential geometric structure,
but instead find mostly linear manifolds or spaces equipped with teleports. To
properly learn the differential geometric structure, non-probabilistic methods
must apply regularizations that enforce large gradients, which go against
common wisdom. We repeat the analysis for probabilistic methods and find that
under reasonable priors, the geometric structure can be recovered. Fully
exploiting the recovered structure, however, requires the development of
stochastic extensions to classic Riemannian geometry. We take early steps in
that regard. Finally, we partly extend the analysis to modern models based on
neural networks, thereby highlighting geometric and probabilistic shortcomings
of current deep generative models.

We introduce compressibility measures as a useful tool to classify the

complexity classes and Turing machine complexity classes. Using this framework,
we obtain a new and simple proof that for groups and commutative semigroups,
the problem is contained in NP. We uncover certain structural and

specifically, we prove NP-hardness for classes of semigroups having a property

a dipolar moment. In the present work, we provide a thorough evaluation of
broadband dielectric spectra of 12 ionic liquids taking into account the often
neglected reorientational dynamics of these ions. We confirm that this dynamics
leads to a clear relaxational signature in the spectra, a fact that so far only
was considered in few previous works. The obtained reorientational relaxation
times are well consistent with earlier inelastic light-scattering and
high-frequency dielectric investigations. Evaluating our dielectric spectra in
terms of reorientational motions reveals a close coupling of the ion-rotation
dynamics to the ionic charge transport in a broad temperature range from the
low-viscosity liquid above room temperature deep into the high-viscosity
supercooled state close to Tg. This coupling does not seem to be mediated by
the viscosity but probably is of more direct nature, pointing to a
revolving-door mechanism as also considered for plastic-crystalline ionic
conductors. Our results show that the reorientational motion of the dipolar
ions plays a significant and so far widely overlooked role for the ionic charge
transport in ionic liquids.

presented using data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2 fb$^{-1}$,
from $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV collected by the LHCb experiment. The
$\tau^+\tau^-$ candidates are reconstructed in final states with the first tau
lepton decaying leptonically, and the second decaying either leptonically or to
one or three charged hadrons. The production cross-section is measured for $Z$
bosons with invariant mass between 60 and 120 GeV/$c^2$, which decay to tau
leptons with transverse momenta greater than 20 GeV/$c$ and pseudorapidities
between 2.0 and 4.5. The cross-section is determined to be
$\sigma_{pp\rightarrow{}Z\rightarrow{}\tau^+\tau^-} = 95.8 \pm 2.1 \pm 4.6 \pm
0.2 \pm 1.1 \mathrm{pb}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the
second is systematic, the third is due to the LHC beam energy uncertainty, and
the fourth to the integrated luminosity uncertainty. This result is compatible
with NNLO Standard model predictions. The ratio of the cross-sections for
$Z\rightarrow\tau^+\tau^-$ to $Z\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$
($Z\rightarrow{}e^+e^-$), determined to be $1.01 \pm 0.05$ ($1.02 \pm 0.06$),
is consistent with the lepton-universality hypothesis in $Z$ decays.

distance measure which brings data points from the same class closer together
and pushes data points from different classes further apart. Recent research
has demonstrated that metric learning approaches can also be applied to trees,
such as molecular structures, abstract syntax trees of computer programs, or
syntax trees of natural language, by learning the cost function of an edit
distance, i.e. the costs of replacing, deleting, or inserting nodes in a tree.
However, learning such costs directly may yield an edit distance which violates
metric axioms, is challenging to interpret, and may not generalize well. In
this contribution, we propose a novel metric learning approach for trees which
we call embedding edit distance learning (BEDL) and which learns an edit
distance indirectly by embedding the tree nodes as vectors, such that the
Euclidean distance between those vectors supports class discrimination. We
learn such embeddings by reducing the distance to prototypical trees from the
same class and increasing the distance to prototypical trees from different
classes. In our experiments, we show that BEDL improves upon the
state-of-the-art in metric learning for trees on six benchmark data sets,
ranging from computer science over biomedical data to a natural-language
processing data set containing over 300,000 nodes.

and third-harmonic generation from thin film surfaces with discontinuous

of a simple metal mirror, or arrangements composed of either different metals

hydrodynamic approach we highlight the case of a gold mirror, and that of a
two-layer system containing indium tin oxide (ITO) and gold. We assume the gold
mirror surface is characterized by a free-electron cloud of varying density
that spills into the vacuum, which as a result of material dispersion exhibits
epsilon-near-zero conditions and local field enhancement at the surface. For a
bylayer consisting of a thin ITO and gold films, if the wave is incident from
the ITO side the electromagnetic field is presented with a free-electron
discontinuity at the ITO/gold interface, and wavelength-dependent,
epsilon-near-zero conditions that enhance local fields and conversion
efficiencies, and determine the surface's emission properties. We evaluate the
relative significance of additional nonlinear sources that arise when a
free-electron discontinuity is present, and show that harmonic generation can
be sensitive to the density of the screening free-electron cloud, and not its
thickness. Our findings also suggest the possibility to control surface
harmonic generation through surface charge engineering.

multidimensional signal completion algorithms that exploit tensor decomposition
models to capture the intricate relationship among entries in a
multidimensional signal. We propose to use tensor completion applied to EEG
data for improving the classification performance in a motor imagery BCI system
with corrupted measurements. Noisy measurements are considered as unknowns that
are inferred from a tensor decomposition model. We evaluate the performance of
four recently proposed tensor completion algorithms plus a simple interpolation
strategy, first with random missing entries and then with missing samples
constrained to have a specific structure (random missing channels), which is a
more realistic assumption in BCI Applications. We measured the ability of these
algorithms to reconstruct the tensor from observed data. Then, we tested the
classification accuracy of imagined movement in a BCI experiment with missing
samples. We show that for random missing entries, all tensor completion
algorithms can recover missing samples increasing the classification
performance compared to a simple interpolation approach. For the random missing
channels case, we show that tensor completion algorithms help to reconstruct
missing channels, significantly improving the accuracy in the classification of
motor imagery, however, not at the same level as clean data. Tensor completion
algorithms are useful in real BCI applications. The proposed strategy could
allow using motor imagery BCI systems even when EEG data is highly affected by
missing channels and/or samples, avoiding the need of new acquisitions in the
calibration stage.

space distortions derived from galaxy surveys including the SDSS BOSS and

Using all data combined, we find a deviation from the prediction of general
relativity in both the effective Newton's constant, $\mu(a,k)$, and in the
gravitational slip, $\eta(a,k)$. The deviation is at a $3.1\sigma$ level in the
joint $\{\mu(a,k),\eta(a,k)\}$ space using a two-parameter phenomenological
model for $\mu$ and $\eta$, and it reaches a $3.7\sigma$ level if a general
parametrisation is used. This signal, which may be subject to unknown
observational systematics, or a sign of new physics, is worth further
investigating with forthcoming observations.

autoencoder and then we use a damage and repair strategy: First, we freeze the
autoencoder and damage the output of the encoder by randomly dropping its
entries. Second, we augment the decoder with a repair network, and train it in
an adversarial manner against the discriminator. The repair network helps
generate more realistic images by inpainting the dropped feature entries. To
make the discriminator focus on the artifacts, we also make it predict what

features learned by creating and spotting artifacts achieve state of the art

actuators with high flexibility and low investment costs. In industrial
applications, however, reliability is essential. Therefore, two time-slotted
medium access methods, DSME and TSCH, were added to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.
They allow collision-free communication in multi-hop networks and provide
channel hopping for mitigating external interferences. The slot schedule used
in these networks is of high importance for the network performance. This paper
supports the development of efficient schedules by providing an analytical
model for the assessment of such schedules, focused on TSCH. A Markov chain
model for the finite queue on every node is introduced that takes the slot
distribution into account. The models of all nodes are interconnected to
calculate network metrics such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and
throughput. An evaluation compares the model with a simulation of the Orchestra
schedule. The model is applied to Orchestra as well as to two simple
distributed scheduling algorithms to demonstrate the importance of
traffic-awareness for achieving high throughput.

the field of social studies of science. The paper confronts this question here
by showing vital determinants of science to explain the sources of social power
and wealth creation by nations. Firstly, this study suggests a new general
definition of science and scientific research that synthetizes previous
concepts and endeavors to extend them: Science discovers the root causes of
phenomena to explain and predict them in a context of adaptation of life to new
economic and social bases, whereas scientific research is a systematic process,
applying methods of scientific inquiry, to solve consequential problems, to
satisfy human wants, to take advantage of important opportunities and/or to
cope with environmental threats. In particular, science and scientific research
are driven by an organized social effort that inevitably reflect the concerns
and interests of nations to achieve advances and discoveries that are spread to
the rest of humankind. This study reveals that scientific research is produced
for social and economic interests of nations (power, wealth creation,
technological superiority, etc.), rather than philosophical inquiries. A main
implication of this study is that the immense growth of science in modern
society is not only due to activity of scientists but rather to general social
efforts of nations to take advantage of important opportunities and/or to cope
with environmental threats, such as war. Empirical evidence endeavors to
support the sources of scientific research for nations, described here.
Finally, relationships between R&D investment and productivity, and research
policy implications are discussed.

potentially failing dams and are key ingredients for evaluating flood risk. In
this paper a new dam breach modeling framework is introduced that shall improve
the reliability of hydrograph predictions of homogeneous earthen embankment
dams. Striving for a small number of parameters, the simplified physics-based
model describes the processes of failing embankment dams by breach enlargement,
driven by progressive surface erosion. Therein the erosion rate of dam material
is modeled by empirical sediment transport formulations. Embedding the model
into a Bayesian multilevel framework allows for quantitative analysis of
different categories of uncertainties. To this end, data available in
literature of observed peak discharge and final breach width of historical dam
failures was used to perform model inversion by applying Markov Chain Monte
Carlo simulation. Prior knowledge is mainly based on non-informative
distribution functions. The resulting posterior distribution shows that the
main source of uncertainty is a correlated subset of parameters, consisting of
the residual error term and the epistemic term quantifying the breach erosion
rate. The prediction intervals of peak discharge and final breach width are
congruent with values known from literature. To finally predict the outflow
hydrograph for real case applications, an alternative residual model was
formulated that assumes perfect data and a perfect model. The fully
probabilistic fashion of hydrograph prediction has the potential to improve the
adequate risk management of downstream flooding.

quantum phases that are rich in physics. As the strength of the long-range
boson-boson interaction increases, the system transitions across different
phases: from a superfluid, through a Mott-insulator to a Tonks gas and,
eventually, a crystal state. The signature of these phases and their
transitions can be unequivocally identified by an experimentally detectable
order parameter, recently described in arXiv:1708.07409. Herein, we calculate
the momentum distributions and the normalized Glauber correlation functions of
dipolar bosons in a one-dimensional optical lattice in order to characterize
all their phases. To understand the behavior of the correlations across the
phase transitions, we first investigate the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of
the one-body reduced density matrix as the function of the dipolar interaction
strength. We then analyze the real- and momentum-space Glauber correlation
functions, thereby gaining a spatially and momentum-resolved insight into the
coherence properties of these quantum phases. We find an intriguing structure
of non-local correlations that, independently of other system parameters,
reveal the phase transitions of the system. In particular, spatial localization
with synchronous momentum delocalization accompanies the formation of
correlated islands in the density. Moreover, our study showcases that precise
control of intersite correlations is possible through manipulation of the depth
of the lattice, while intrasite correlations are influenced solely by changing
the dipolar interaction strength.

intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters and are believed to play the
primary role in offsetting radiative cooling in the ICM. However, the details
of how the energy from AGN feedback thermalizes to heat the ICM is not well
understood, partly due to the unknown composition and energetics of the
cavities. The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, a measure of the integrated
pressure along the line of sight, provides a means of measuring the thermal
contents of the cavities, to discriminate between thermal, nonthermal, and
other sources of pressure support. Here we report measurements of the SZ effect
at 30 GHz toward the galaxy cluster MS 0735.6+7421 (MS0735), using the Combined
Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). MS0735 hosts the most
energetic AGN outburst known and lobes of radio synchrotron emission coincident
with a pair of giant X-ray cavities $\sim 200$ across. Our CARMA maps show a
clear deficit in the SZ signal coincident with the X-ray identified cavities,
when compared to a smooth X-ray derived pressure model. We find that the
cavities have very little SZ-contributing material, suggesting that they are
either supported by very diffuse thermal plasma with temperature in excess of
hundreds of keV, or are not supported thermally. Our results represent the
first detection (with $4.4 \sigma$ significance) of this phenomenon with the SZ
effect.

solvation of charged molecules in an implicit solvent as the number of solute
molecules and the size of the surrounding box tend to infinity. The energy is
given by a combination of local terms accounting for the physical presence of
the molecules in the solvent and a nonlocal electrical energy with or without
an ionic effect. In the presence of an ionic effect, the authors prove a
screening effect in the limit, i.e., the limit is completely localized and
hence electrical long-range interactions of the molecules can be neglected. In
the absence of the ionic effect, the authors show that the behavior of the
energy depends on the scaling of the number of molecules with respect to the
size of the surrounding box. All scaling regimes are identified and
corresponding limit results proved. In regimes with many solute molecules this
limit includes electrical interactions of $H^{-1}$-type between the molecules.

turbulent motions whose amplitude increases with radius, as revealed by
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. However, its physical origin remains
unclear. It could either be due to an excess injection of turbulence at large
radii, or faster turbulence dissipation at small radii. We investigate this by
studying the time evolution of turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM)
after major mergers, using the Omega500 non-radiative hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations. By applying a novel wavelet analysis to study the
radial dependence of the ICM turbulence spectrum, we discover that faster
turbulence dissipation in the inner high density regions leads to the
increasing turbulence amplitude with radius. We also find that the ICM
turbulence at all radii decays in two phases after a major merger: an early
fast decay phase followed by a slow secular decay phase. The buoyancy effects
resulting from the ICM density stratification becomes increasingly important
during turbulence decay, as revealed by a decreasing turbulence Froude number
$Fr \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. Our results indicate that the stronger density
stratification and smaller eddy turn-over time are the likely causes of the
faster turbulence dissipation rate in the inner regions of the cluster.

optical spectroscopy that has become an important tool for studying ultrafast
dynamics in a wide range of systems. It is an optical analog of
multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy that enables the
measurement of homogeneous linewidths in inhomogeneously broadened systems,
many-body interactions, and coupling between excited resonances, all of which
are not simultaneously accessible by any other linear or non-linear method.
Current implementations of MDCS require a bulky apparatus and suffer from
resolution and acquisition speed limitations that constrain their applications
outside the laboratory3-5. Here we propose and demonstrate an approach to
nonlinear coherent spectroscopy that utilizes three frequency combs with
slightly different repetition rates. Unlike traditional nonlinear methods,
tri-comb spectroscopy uses only a single photodetector and no mechanical moving
elements to enable faster acquisition times, while also providing comb
resolution. As a proof of concept, a multidimensional coherent spectrum with
comb cross-diagonal resolution is generated using only 365 ms of data. These
improvements make multidimensional coherent spectroscopy relevant for systems
with narrow resonances (especially cold atomic and molecular systems). In
addition the method has the potential to be field deployable for chemical
sensing applications.

error rates both conditioned on the type of decoy used. These bounds are then
used to deduce the single photon yield and error rate, which in turn are used

method increases the provably secure key rate of realistic quantum channels by
at least 30% when the raw key length is $\approx 10^5$ to $10^6$. More

an image-level classification by using the quantile function. The quantile

to the MI framework by randomly selecting cropped regions on which to apply MI

suffer from miscalibrations. A popular approach to address this issue is to
assume simplistic models of miscalibration (such as linear biases) to de-bias
the scores. This approach, however, often fares poorly because people's
miscalibrations are typically far more complex and not well understood. In the
absence of simplifying assumptions on the miscalibration, it is widely believed
by the crowdsourcing community that the only useful information in the cardinal
scores is the induced ranking. In this paper, inspired by the framework of
Stein's shrinkage, empirical Bayes, and the classic two-envelope problem, we
contest this widespread belief. Specifically, we consider cardinal scores with
arbitrary (or even adversarially chosen) miscalibrations which are only
required to be consistent with the induced ranking. We design estimators which
despite making no assumptions on the miscalibration, strictly and uniformly
outperform all possible estimators that rely on only the ranking. Our
estimators are flexible in that they can be used as a plug-in for a variety of
applications, and we provide a proof-of-concept for A/B testing and ranking.
Our results thus provide novel insights in the eternal debate between cardinal

approaching a magnetic quantum critical point (QCP). The second is the
occurrence of magnetic order along a very hard crystalline electric field (CEF)
direction, i.e. along the one with the smallest available magnetic moment.
Here, we present a detailed study of the evolution of the magnetic order in
this system from a FM state with moments along the very hard c direction at x =
0.27 towards the yet unknown magnetic state at x = 0. We first observe a
transition towards an AFM canted state with decreasing x and then to a pure AFM
state. This confirms that the QCP in YbRh2Si2 is AFM, but the phase diagram is
very similar to those observed in some inherently FM systems like NbFe2 and
CeRuPO, which suggests that the basic underlying instability might be FM.
Despite the huge CEF anisotropy the ordered moment retains a component along
the c-axis also in the AFM state. The huge CEF anisotropy in Yb(Rh1-xCox)2Si2
excludes that this hard-axis ordering originates from a competing exchange
anisotropy as often proposed for other heavy-fermion systems. Instead, it
points to an order-by-disorder based mechanism.

the different contributions, originating from the scalar, vecor and tensor

the decay rate of $\tau^-\to K^-\pi^0\nu_\tau$ can be generated due to the
presence of both, the weak phase in the Wilson coefficient corresponding to the
tensor operator and the strong phase difference resulting from the interference
between the form factors expressing the matrix elements of the vector and
tensor hadronic currents. After taking into account all relevant constraints,
we find that the generated direct CP asymmetry is of order $10^{-8}$ which is
several orders of magnitude larger than the standard model prediction. We show
also that, in two Higgs doublet model with generic Yukawa structure , direct
local or non integrated CP violation can be as large as $0.3$ % not far from

measurements, we know GW170817 has a wide range of plausible component masses,
depending also on less well-constrained properties such as the spin and tidal
deformability of the component stars. The kilonova light curve --- and hence
the total ejecta mass from a given source --- depends on the relative
contribution of dynamical ejecta and other sources such as disk winds.
Electromagnetic observations and model fitting of the ejecta properties from
the subsequent kilonova detection provided values of the ejecta mass from the
merger. These values, when combined with the gravitational-wave measurement
disfavors an equal-mass configuration, with the level of disagreement dependent
on the assumed amount of ejecta mass of dynamical origin. Within the confines
of our own galaxy, several binary neutron star systems along with measurements
of their component masses have been made. If those distributions are indicative
of a universal distribution, the joint measurement of the component masses of
GW170817 represents an outlier. This tension is not easily resolvable from
physical arguments, as the proposed pathways which form binary neutron stars do
not often produce very asymmetrical pairs. Even accounting for the uncertainty

that the distribution of binary neutron star masses in the galaxy is not

pre-train neural networks on a self-supervised auxiliary task, predicting the
3D distance between two patches sampled from the same brain. Compared to a
random initialization, fine-tuning from these networks results in significantly
better segmentations. We show that the self-supervised model has implicitly
learned to distinguish several cortical brain areas -- a strong indicator that
the proposed auxiliary task is appropriate for cytoarchitectonic mapping.

free membrane has been explored in great detail, both theoretically and
experimentally. However, understanding this relationship for membranes, locally
pinned by proteins, is significantly more challenging. Given that the coupling
of the membrane to the cell cytoskeleton, the extracellular matrix and to other
internal structures is crucial for the regulation of a number of cellular
processes, understanding the role of the pinning is of great interest. In this
manuscript we consider a single protein (elastic spring of a finite rest
length) pinning a membrane modelled in the Monge gauge. First, we determine the
Green$'$s function for the system and complement this approach by the
calculation of the mode coupling coefficients for the plane wave expansion, and
the orthonormal fluctuation modes, in turn building a set of tools for
numerical and analytic studies of a pinned membrane. Furthermore, we explore
static correlations of the free and the pinned membrane, as well as the
membrane shape, showing that all three are mutually interdependent and have an
identical long-range behaviour characterised by the correlation length.
Interestingly, the latter displays a non-monotonic behaviour as a function of
membrane tension. Importantly, exploiting these relations allows for the
experimental determination of the elastic parameters of the pinning. Last but
not least, we calculate the interaction potential between two pinning sites and
show that, even in the absence of the membrane deformation, the pinnings will
be subject to an attractive force due to changes in membrane fluctuations.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1607.05001",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we perform a complete failure analysis of the interval-passing
algorithm (IPA) for compressed sensing, an efficient iterative algorithm for
reconstructing a $k$-sparse nonnegative $n$-dimensional real signal
$\boldsymbol{x}$ from a small number of linear measurements $\boldsymbol{y}$.
In particular, we show that the IPA fails to recover $\boldsymbol{x}$ from
$\boldsymbol{y}$ if and only if it fails to recover a corresponding binary
vector of the same support, and also that only positions of nonzero values in
the measurement matrix are of importance to the success of recovery. Based on
this observation, we introduce termatiko sets and show that the IPA fails to
fully recover $\boldsymbol x$ if and only if the support of $\boldsymbol x$
contains a nonempty termatiko set, thus giving a complete (graph-theoretic)
description of the failing sets of the IPA. Two heuristics to locate small-size
termatiko sets are presented. For binary column-regular measurement matrices
with no $4$-cycles, we provide a lower bound on the termatiko distance, defined
as the smallest size of a nonempty termatiko set. For measurement matrices
constructed from the parity-check matrices of array LDPC codes, upper bounds on
the termatiko distance are provided for column-weight at most $7$, while for
column-weight $3$, the exact termatiko distance and its corresponding
multiplicity are provided. Next, we show that adding redundant rows to the
measurement matrix does not create new termatiko sets, but rather potentially
removes termatiko sets and thus improves performance. An algorithm is provided
to efficiently search for such redundant rows. Finally, we present numerical
results for different specific measurement matrices and also for
protograph-based ensembles of measurement matrices, as well as simulation
results of IPA performance, showing the influence of small-size termatiko sets.

significant changes compared to past published analyses. The stellar EM
distributions correlate with surface X-ray flux (F_X) in a predictable way,
regardless of spectral type. Thus, we provide EM distributions as a function of
F_X, which can be used to estimate the EM distribution of any main sequence
star with a measured broadband X-ray luminosity. Comparisons are made with
solar EM distributions, both full-disk distributions and spatially resolved
ones from active regions (ARs), flares, and the quiet Sun. For moderately
active stars, the slopes and magnitudes of the EM distributions are in
excellent agreement with those of solar ARs for log T<6.6, suggesting that such
stars have surfaces completely filled with solar-like ARs. A stellar surface
covered with solar X-class flares yields a reasonable approximation for the EM
distributions of the most active stars. Unlike the EM distributions, coronal
abundances are very spectral-type dependent, and we provide relations with
surface temperature for both relative and absolute abundances. Finally, the
coronal abundances of the exoplanet host star Tau Boo A (F7 V) are anomalous,
and we propose that this is due to the presence of the exoplanet.

distribution of particle displacements in Fickian diffusion is not necessarily
Gaussian, and thus the Einstein and Smoluchowski theory describing the Brownian
motion of individual objects in a fluid would not be applicable. In this
Letter, we investigate whether the FNG dynamics so far reported in gels,
granular materials, biological and active matter systems, is also a distinctive
feature of colloidal liquid crystals. To this end, we perform Brownian Dynamics
simulations of oblate and prolate colloidal particles in the nematic phase. We
detect a normal and Gaussian dynamics at short and long time scales, whereas,
at intermediate time scales, a non-Fickian and non-Gaussian dynamics is found.
Additionally, we revisit the nature of the decay of the self-van Hove

ellipsoidal, rather than spherical, Gaussian distribution. The new expression
that we propose is able to correctly assess the Gaussian dynamics in inherently

constrain giant planet formation theories. Here we study the kinematic patterns
which arise from planet-disc interactions and their observability in CO
rotational emission lines. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations of single giant planets, and predict the emergent intensity field
with radiative transfer. Pressure gradients at planet-carved gaps, spiral wakes
and vortices bear strong kinematic counterparts. The iso-velocity contours in
the CO(2-1) line centroids $v_\circ$ reveal large-scale perturbations,
corresponding to abrupt transitions from below sub-Keplerian to super-Keplerian
rotation along with radial and vertical flows. The increase in line optical
depth at the edge of the gap also modulates $v_\circ$, but this is a mild
effect compared to the dynamical imprint of the planet-disc interaction. The
large-scale deviations from the Keplerian rotation thus allow the planets to be
indirectly detected via the first moment maps of molecular gas tracers, at ALMA
angular resolutions. The strength of these deviations depends on the mass of
the perturber. This initial study paves the way to eventually determine the
mass of the planet by comparison with more detailed models.

  Separation","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1711.06454",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image style transfer has drawn broad attention in recent years. However, most
existing methods aim to explicitly model the transformation between different
styles, and the learned model is thus not generalizable to new styles. We here
propose a unified style transfer framework for both character typeface transfer
and neural style transfer tasks leveraging style and content separation. A key
merit of such framework is its generalizability to new styles and contents. The
overall framework consists of style encoder, content encoder, mixer and
decoder. The style encoder and content encoder are used to extract the style
and content representations from the corresponding reference images. The mixer
integrates the above two representations and feeds it into the decoder to
generate images with the target style and content. During training, the encoder
networks learn to extract styles and contents from limited size of
style/content reference images. This learning framework allows simultaneous
style transfer among multiple styles and can be deemed as a special
`multi-task' learning scenario. The encoders are expected to capture the
underlying features for different styles and contents which is generalizable to
new styles and contents. Under this framework, we design two individual
networks for character typeface transfer and neural style transfer,
respectively. For character typeface transfer, to separate the style features
and content features, we leverage the conditional dependence of styles and
contents given an image. For neural style transfer, we leverage the statistical
information of feature maps in certain layers to represent style. Extensive
experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the
proposed methods.

Meta-Embeddings in conjunction with the empirical fMRI data associated with

  Speculation",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Speculative execution which is used pervasively in modern CPUs can leave side
effects in the processor caches and other structures even when the speculated
instructions do not commit and their direct effect is not visible. The recent
Meltdown and Spectre attacks have shown that this behavior can be exploited to
expose privileged information to an unprivileged attacker. In particular, the
attack forces the speculative execution of a code gadget that will carry out
the illegal read, which eventually gets squashed, but which leaves a
side-channel trail that can be used by the attacker to infer the value. Several
attack variations are possible, allowing arbitrary exposure of the full kernel
memory to an unprivileged attacker. In this paper, we introduce a new model
(SafeSpec) for supporting speculation in a way that is immune to side-channel
leakage necessary for attacks such as Meltdown and Spectre. In particular,
SafeSpec stores side effects of speculation in a way that is not visible to the
attacker while the instructions are speculative. The speculative state is then
either committed to the main CPU structures if the branch commits, or squashed
if it does not, making all direct side effects of speculative code invisible.
The solution must also address the possibility of a covert channel from
speculative instructions to committed instructions before these instructions
are committed. We show that SafeSpec prevents all three variants of Spectre and
Meltdown, as well as new variants that we introduce. We also develop a cycle
accurate model of modified design of an x86-64 processor and show that the
performance impact is negligible. We build prototypes of the hardware support
in a hardware description language to show that the additional overhead is
small. We believe that SafeSpec completely closes this class of attacks, and
that it is practical to implement.

methods. Therefore, we propose a new F1-based metric yielding a changed system
ranking. Next, we compare the features and architectures used, which leads to a
novel feature-rich stacked LSTM model that performs on par with the best
systems, but is superior in predicting minority classes. To understand the

in-domain and cross-domain experiments. Our qualitative and quantitative study
helps interpreting the original FNC-1 scores and understand which features help
improving performance and why. Our new dataset and all source code used during

active upon triggering of a local timer and has access only to a portion of the

technique, based on the method of multipliers, each node performs, when it
wakes up, either a descent step on a local augmented Lagrangian or an ascent
step on the local multiplier vector. Nodes realize when to switch from the
descent step to the ascent one through an asynchronous distributed logic-AND,
which detects when all the nodes have reached a predefined tolerance in the
minimization of the augmented Lagrangian. It is shown that the resulting
distributed algorithm is equivalent to a block coordinate descent for the
minimization of the global augmented Lagrangian. This allows one to extend the
properties of the centralized method of multipliers to the considered
distributed framework. Two application examples are presented to validate the

ablation method to protect event-level privacy in electronic medical records.
Using a list of 13 sensitive diagnoses, we evaluate the feasibility and the
efficacy of the proposed method. As feature ablation progresses, the
identifiability of a sensitive medical condition decreases with varying speeds
on different diseases. We find that these sensitive diagnoses can be divided

progressively declining identifiability (AUC below 0.7 with between 200 and 700

CABG patients, who were extubated within 24 hours of surgery were identified in
a critical care database (MIMIC-III). Nurse elicited pain scores were
documented throughout their hospital stay on a scale of 0 to 10. Levels were
tracked as mean, median, and maximum values, and categorized as no (0/10), mild
(1-3), moderate (4-6) and severe pain (7-10). Regression analysis was employed
to analyze the relationship between pain scores and outcomes of interest
(mortality and hospital LOS). After covariate adjustment, increased levels of
pain were found to be associated with lower mortality rates and reduced
hospital LOS. Conclusion: These counterintuitive results for post-CABG pain
related outcomes have not been previously reported. While not representing
strong enough evidence to alter clinical practice, confirmed and reliable
results such as these should serve as a research trigger and prompt further
studies into unexpected associations between pain and patient outcomes. With

first step required to provide confidence for decision making in property- or
performance-based design. As a manner of illustration, a thorough probabilistic
assessment of the CALPHAD model parameters is performed against the available
data for a Hf-Si binary case study using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling
approach. The plausible optimum values and uncertainties of the parameters are
thus obtained, which can be propagated to the resulting phase diagram. Using
the parameter values obtained from deterministic optimization in a
computational thermodynamic assessment tool (in this case Thermo-Calc) as the
prior information for the parameter values and ranges in the sampling process
is often necessary to achieve a reasonable cost for uncertainty quantification.
This brings up the problem of finding an appropriate CALPHAD model with
high-level of confidence which is a very hard and costly task that requires
considerable expert skill. A Bayesian hypothesis testing based on Bayes'
factors is proposed to fulfill the need of model selection in this case, which
is applied to compare four recommended models for the Hf-Si system. However, it
is demonstrated that information fusion approaches, i.e., Bayesian model
averaging and an error correlation-based model fusion, can be used to combine
the useful information existing in all the given models rather than just using
the best selected model, which may lack some information about the system being

quantized to lower precisions. Quantizing to sub 8-bit activations and weights
can result in accuracy falling below an acceptable threshold. Techniques exist
for closing the accuracy gap of limited numeric precision typically by
increasing computation. This results in a trade-off between throughput and
accuracy and can be tailored for different networks through various
combinations of activation and weight data widths. Hardware architectures like
FPGAs provide the opportunity for data width specific computation through
unique logic configurations leading to highly optimized processing that is
unattainable by full precision networks. Ternary and binary weighted networks
offer an efficient method of inference for 2-bit and 1-bit data respectively.
Most hardware architectures can take advantage of the memory storage and
bandwidth savings that come along with smaller datapaths, but very few
architectures can take advantage of limited numeric precision at the
computation level. In this paper, we present a hardware design for FPGAs that
takes advantage of bandwidth, memory, power, and computation savings of limited

throughput and accuracy for various networks and how they map to our framework.
Further, we show how limited numeric precision computation can be efficiently
