  systems concepts","24 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Explaining how and why some species evolved to have more complex social
structures than others has been a long-term goal for many researchers in animal
behavior because it would provide important insight into the links between
evolution and ecology, sociality, and cognition. However, despite long-standing
interest, the evolution of social complexity is still poorly understood. This
may be due in part to researchers focusing on the feasibility of quantifying
aspects of sociality, rather than what features are characteristic of animal
social complexity in the first place. Any given approach to studying complexity
can tell us some things about animal sociality, but may miss others, so it is
critical to decide first how to conceptualize complexity before jumping in to
quantifying it. Here, we briefly summarize five existing approaches to
measuring social complexity. Then, we highlight three fundamental concepts that
are commonly used in the field of complex systems: (1) scales of organization,
(2) compression, and (3) emergence. All of these concepts are applicable to the
study of animal social systems, but are not often explicitly addressed in
existing social complexity measures. We discuss how these concepts can provide
a rigorous foundation for conceptualizing social complexity, the potential
benefits of incorporating them, and how existing measures do (or do not)
include them. Ultimately, researchers need to critically evaluate any measure
of animal social complexity in order to balance the biological relevance of the
aspect of sociality they are quantifying with the feasibility of obtaining
enough data.

concentration gradient is present. Here we report the experimental and
numerical study of a self-propelling oil droplet in a vertically stratified
ethanol/water mixture: At first, the droplet sinks slowly due to gravity, but
then, before having reached its density matched position, jumps up suddenly.
More remarkably, the droplet bounces repeatedly with an ever increasing jumping
distance, until all of a sudden it stops after about 30 min. We identify the
Marangoni stress at the droplet/liquid interface as responsible for the
jumping: its strength grows exponentially because it pulls down ethanol-rich
liquid, which in turn increases its strength even more. The jumping process can
repeat because gravity restores the system. Finally, the sudden death of the
jumping droplet is also explained. Our findings have demonstrated a type of
prominent droplet bouncing inside a continuous medium with no wall or sharp

is to have some knowledge of the application domain, because the system can be
vulnerable to use cases that were not seen in the training phase; such a
scenario is often referred to as a domain mismatched condition. In general, we
assume that there is enough variation in the training dataset to expose the
system to multiple domains. In this work, we study how to best make use a

domains. Our goal is to process the input without any knowledge of the target
domain while preserving robust performance on other domains as well. To
accomplish this objective, we propose a domain attentive fusion approach for

The long term stability of BPF arises from particle interactions which in the

parallel implementation of BPF nontrivial.
  In this paper we show that it is possible to constrain the interactions in a

weight $|x_{n+1}|^a$ for $a\in (-1, 1)$, which arises as the local extension of
the obstacle problem for the fractional Laplacian (a non-local problem). We
develop a refined expansion of the solution around its singular points by
building on the ideas introduced by Figalli and Serra to study the fine
properties of the singular set in the classical obstacle problem. As a result,
under a superharmonicity condition on the obstacle, we prove that each stratum
of the singular set is locally contained in a single $C^2$ manifold, up to a
lower dimensional subset, and the top stratum is locally contained in a
$C^{1,\alpha}$ manifold for some $\alpha > 0$ if $a < 0$.
  In studying the top stratum, we discover a dichotomy, until now unseen, in
this problem (or, equivalently, the fractional obstacle problem). We find that
second blow-ups at singular points in the top stratum are global, homogeneous
solutions to a codimension two lower dimensional obstacle problem (or
fractional thin obstacle problem) when $a < 0$, whereas second blow-ups at
singular points in the top stratum are global, homogeneous, and $a$-harmonic
polynomials when $a \geq 0$. To do so, we establish regularity results for this
codimension two problem, what we call the very thin obstacle problem.
  Our methods extend to the majority of the singular set even when no sign
assumption on the Laplacian of the obstacle is made. In this general case, we
are able to prove that the singular set can be covered by countably many $C^2$
manifolds, up to a lower dimensional subset.

designed for the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in single-source

pre-processing, voice activity detection (VAD), localization, tracking. The
signal pre-processing pipeline includes the short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
of the multichannel input captured by the array and the cross power spectral
density (CPSD) matrices estimation. The VAD is calculated with a trace-based
threshold of the CPSD matrices. The localization is then computed using our
recently proposed diagonal unloading (DU) beamforming, which has low-complexity
and high resolution. The DOA estimation is finally smoothed with a Kalman filer
(KF). Experimental results on the LOCATA development dataset are reported in
terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) for a 7-microphone linear array, the
12-microphone pseudo-spherical array integrated in a prototype head for a

  University, Ireland",,,,"hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We revisit the construction of the composite Higgs models in a context of the
bottom-up holographic approach. The soft wall framework is under consideration
imposing the translation of the $4D$ global symmetry breaking characteristic to
the new strongly interacting sector in the $5D$ bulk. The focus stays on the
minimal $SO(5)\to SO(4)$ breaking pattern. The $5D$ model has a specific form
inspired by the effective models of QCD, representing a generalized sigma model
coupled both to the composite resonances and to the SM gauge bosons. The latter
are treated as external $4D$ sources and conceptually develop no propagation
into the bulk. The holographic description allows for the consideration of spin
one and spin zero resonances. The resulting spectrum leads in a natural way to
a variety of new composite resonances, four of which represent the massless
Goldstone bosons. Existing experimental constraints on the electroweak
precision parameters permit to accommodate vector and scalar resonances with
masses in the $1 - 2$ TeV range without difficulties, but higher masses are
possible too. Moreover, for the SM gauge fields holography provides relevant
vacuum polarization amplitudes and mixing with composite resonances. Further
considering higher order correlation functions we can formulate
semi-quantitative predictions for the effective couplings and cross-sections.
These provide additional restrictions that are currently being investigated.

selection, notably allostery, the capacity to be regulated through long-range
effects, and evolvability, the capacity to adapt to new selective pressures. An
evolutionary scenario is proposed where proteins acquire these two features
indirectly as a by-product of their selection for a more fundamental property,
exquisite discrimination, the capacity to bind discriminatively very similar
ligands. Achieving this task is shown to typically require proteins to undergo
a conformational change. We argue that physical and evolutionary constraints
impel this change to be controlled by a group of sites extending from the
binding site. Proteins can thus acquire a latent potential for allosteric
regulation and evolutionary adaptation because of long-range effects that
initially arise as evolutionary spandrels. This scenario accounts for the
groups of conserved and coevolving residues observed in multiple sequence
alignments. However, we propose that most pairs of coevolving and contacting
residues inferred from such alignments have a different origin, related to
thermal stability. A physical model is presented that illustrates this
evolutionary scenario and its implications. The scenario can be implemented in
experiments of protein evolution to directly test its predictions.

attention mechanism to give large weight on sentiment-related words.
Experimental results show that our method can increase classification accuracy
for neural sequence models on both SST-5 and MR dataset. Specifically, the
enhanced Bi-LSTM model can even compare with a Tree-LSTM which uses expensive

function for an extended collisionless system, with known density profile and
in equilibrium within an axisymmetric gravitational potential. Assuming that it
depends on only two integrals of motion, namely the energy and the component of
the angular momentum along the axis of symmetry $L_z$, there is a one-to-one
correspondence between the density profile and the component of the
distribution function that is even in $L_z$, as well as between the weighted
azimuthal velocity profile and the odd component. This inversion procedure was
originally proposed by Lynden-Bell and later refined in its numerical
implementation by Hunter & Qian; after overcoming a technical difficulty, we
apply it here for the first time in presence of a strongly flattened component,
as a novel approach of extracting the phase-space distribution function for
dark matter particles in the halo of spiral galaxies. We compare results
obtained for realistic axisymmetric models to those in the spherical symmetric
limit as assumed in previous analyses, showing the rather severe shortcomings
in the latter. We then apply the scheme to the Milky Way and discuss the
implications for the direct dark matter searches. In particular, we reinterpret
the null results of the Xenon1T experiment for spin-(in)dependent interactions

century, when mathematician Sophus Lie laid the foundations of the theory of
continuous transformation groups. As it often happens, its usage has spread
over diverse areas of science and technology many years later. In robotics, we
are recently experiencing an important trend in its usage, at least in the
fields of estimation, and particularly in motion estimation for navigation. Yet
for a vast majority of roboticians, Lie groups are highly abstract
constructions and therefore difficult to understand and to use. This may be due
to the fact that most of the literature on Lie theory is written by and for
mathematicians and physicists, who might be more used than us to the deep
abstractions this theory deals with.
  In estimation for robotics it is often not necessary to exploit the full
capacity of the theory, and therefore an effort of selection of materials is
required. In this paper, we will walk through the most basic principles of the
Lie theory, with the aim of conveying clear and useful ideas, and leave a
significant corpus of the Lie theory behind. Even with this mutilation, the
material included here has proven to be extremely useful in modern estimation
algorithms for robotics, especially in the fields of SLAM, visual odometry, and

parameters $p \in (0,1)$ and $q\ge 1$. This is a generalization of the standard
bond percolation (with open probability $p$) which is biased by a factor $q$
raised to the number of connected components. We study the well known
FK-dynamics on this model where the update at an edge depends on the global
geometry of the system unlike the Glauber Heat Bath dynamics for spin systems,
and prove that for all small enough $p$ (depending on the dimension) and any
$q>1$, the FK-dynamics exhibits the cutoff phenomenon at
$\lambda_{\infty}^{-1}\log n$ with a window size $O(\log\log n)$, where
$\lambda_{\infty}$ is the large $n$ limit of the spectral gap of the process.
Our proof extends the Information Percolation framework of Lubetzky and Sly
[21] to the Random-Cluster model and also relies on the arguments of Blanca and
Sinclair [4] who proved a sharp $O(\log n)$ mixing time bound for the planar
version. A key aspect of our proof is the analysis of the effect of a sequence
of dependent (across time) Bernoulli percolations extracted from the graphical
construction of the dynamics, on how information propagates.

various sizes, morphologies, and luminosities. For each region the hydrogen RRL
intensity decreases roughly as a power-law with distance from the center of the
region. This suggests that radiation leaking from the HII region is responsible
for the majority of surrounding ionized gas producing RRL emission. Our results
further indicate that the hydrogen RRL intensity appears to be fundamentally
related to the HII region sizes traced by their photodissociation regions, such
that physically smaller HII regions show a steeper decrease in intensity with
increasing distance from the region centers. As a result, giant HII regions may
have a much larger effect in maintaining the ionization of the interstellar
medium. For six of the eight observed HII regions we find a decrease in the
4He+/H+ abundance ratio with increasing distance, indicating that He-ionizing
photons are being absorbed within the ionization front of the HII region. There
is enhanced carbon RRL emission toward directions with strong continuum
background, suggesting that the carbon emission is amplified by stimulated
emission.

feature of ARM CoreSight components (context ID) combined with a custom DIFT

(TMDs) is dominated by recombination of electrons in the conduction band with
holes in the spin-orbit split valence bands, and there are two distinct
emission features referred to as the A-peak (ground state exciton) and B-peak
(higher spin-orbit split state). The intensity ratio of these two features
varies widely and several contradictory interpretations have been reported. We
analyze the room temperature PL from MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 monolayers and
show that these variations arise from differences in the non-radiative
recombination associated with defect densities. Hence, the relative intensities
of the A- and B-emission features can be used to qualitatively asses the
non-radiative recombination, and thus the quality of the sample. A low B/A
ratio is indicative of low defect density and high sample quality. Emission
from TMD monolayers is governed by unique optical selection rules which make
them promising materials for valleytronic operations. We observe a notably
higher valley polarization in the B-exciton relative to the A-exciton. The high
polarization is a consequence of the shorter B-exciton lifetime resulting from
rapid relaxation of excitons from the B-exciton to the A-exciton of the valence
band.

that for software analytics it is possible, useful and necessary to combine

The resulting optimization problem is a revitalization of the classical relaxed
stochastic control. We carry out a complete analysis of the problem in the

distribution for balancing exploitation and exploration is Gaussian. This in
turn interprets and justifies the widely adopted Gaussian exploration in RL,
beyond its simplicity for sampling. Moreover, the exploitation and exploration
are captured, respectively and mutual-exclusively, by the mean and variance of
the Gaussian distribution. We also find that a more random environment contains
more learning opportunities in the sense that less exploration is needed. We
characterize the cost of exploration, which, for the LQ case, is shown to be
proportional to the entropy regularization weight and inversely proportional to
the discount rate. Finally, as the weight of exploration decays to zero, we
prove the convergence of the solution of the entropy-regularized LQ problem to

repeated local translation of points by certain displacement vectors.
Therefore, the refinement rules of a (2N+2)-point scheme for N=M are
recursively obtained from the refinement rules of the (2N+2)-point schemes for
N=0,1,2,...,M-1. The complexity, polynomial reproduction and polynomial
generation of these schemes are increased by two for the successive values of
$N$. Furthermore, we modify this family of schemes to a family of (2N+3)-point
schemes with two tension parameters. Moreover, a family of interproximate
subdivision schemes with tension parameters is also introduced, which allows a
different tension value for each edge and vertex of the initial control
polygon. Interproximate schemes generate curves and surfaces such that some
initial control points are interpolated and others are approximated.

interesting to note that the two perturbed metric potentials have same

the first simple model, that of non-rotating spherically symmetric dynamically

is possible in metals possessing certain favorable parameters such as lattice
vibrations at high frequencies. However, these general theories do not suffice
to predict real superconductors. New superconducting materials can be predicted
now with the aid of first principles calculations based on Density Functional

hydrides possessing a clathrate structure, where the host atom (Ca, Y, La) is
at the center of the cage formed by hydrogen atoms. For LaH10 and YH10
superconductivity, with critical temperatures Tc ranging between 240 and 320 K
is predicted at megabar pressures. Here, we report superconductivity with a
record Tc ~ 250 K within the Fm-3m structure of LaH10 at a pressure P ~ 170
GPa. We proved the existence of superconductivity at 250 K through the
observation of zero-resistance, isotope effect, and the decrease of Tc under an
external magnetic field, which suggests an upper critical magnetic field of 120
T at zero-temperature. The pressure dependence of the transition temperatures
Tc (P) has a maximum of 250-252 K at the pressure of about 170 GPa. This leap,

available to analysis methods Hughes et al. (2005). Isogeometric analysis has
been particularly successful in structural analysis; one reason being the
wide-spread use of two-dimensional finite elements in this field. For fluid
dynamics, where three-dimensional analysis is usually indispensable,
isogeometric methods are more complicated, yet of course not impossible, to
apply in a general fashion. This paper describes a method that enables the
solution of fluid-structure interaction with a matching spline description of
the interface. On the structural side, the spline is used in an isogeometric
setting. On the fluid side, the same spline is used in the framework of a
NURBS-enhanced finite element method (extension of Sevilla et al. (2011)). The
coupling of the structural and the fluid solution is greatly facilitated by the
common spline interface. The use of the identical spline representation for
both sides permits a direct transfer of the necessary quantities, all the while
still allowing an adjusted, individual refinement level for both sides.

consider the complexity of finding closed directed walks in $G$ that are either
contractible (trivial in homotopy) or bounding (trivial in integer homology) in

simple contractible cycle in $O(n+m)$ time, or a contractible closed walk in
$O(n+m)$ time, or a bounding closed walk in $O(\beta (n+m))$ time. Our
algorithms rely on subtle relationships between strong connectivity in $G$ and
in the dual graph $G^*$; our contractible-closed-walk algorithm also relies on
a seminal topological result of Hass and Scott. We also prove that detecting
simple bounding cycles is NP-hard.
  We also describe three polynomial-time algorithms to compute shortest
contractible closed walks, depending on whether the fundamental group of the
surface is free, abelian, or hyperbolic. A key step in our algorithm for
hyperbolic surfaces is the construction of a context-free grammar with
$O(g^2L^2)$ non-terminals that generates all contractible closed walks of
length at most L, and only contractible closed walks, in a system of quads of
genus $g\ge2$. Finally, we show that computing shortest simple contractible

all NP-hard.

masses at very high redshift has motivated us to study how these massive
objects formed during the first billion years after the Big Bang. The most
promising model that has been proposed to explain this is the direct collapse
of protogalactic gas clouds. In this scenario, very high accretion rates are
needed to form massive objects early on and the suppression of $\mathrm H_2$
cooling is important in regulating the fragmentation. Recent studies have shown
that if we use a strong radiation background, the hydrogen molecules are
destroyed, favoring the high accretion rates and therefore producing objects of
very high mass. In this work we study the impact of UV radiation fields in a
primordial gas cloud using the recently coupled code GRADSPH-KROME for the
modeling of gravitational collapse including primordial chemistry to explore
the fragmentation in AU scales and hence the formation of first SMBHs. We found
that to suppress the formation of $\mathrm H_2$ a very high value of $J_{21}$
is required, because of that we conclude that the direct collapse black holes
(DCBHs) are very unlikely to be an explanation for the formation of the first
SMBHs.

rapidly fading optical counterparts, we used the Dark Energy Camera to perform
an $i$-band search for the BBH merger GW170814, the first gravitational wave
detected by three interferometers. The 87-deg$^2$ localization region (at 90\%
confidence) centered in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprint enabled us to
image 86\% of the probable sky area to a depth of $i\sim 23$ mag and provide
the most comprehensive dataset to search for EM emission from BBH mergers. To
identify candidates, we perform difference imaging with our search images and
with templates from pre-existing DES images. The analysis strategy and
selection requirements were designed to remove supernovae and to identify
transients that decline in the first two epochs. We find two candidates, each
of which is spatially coincident with a star or a high-redshift galaxy in the
DES catalogs, and they are thus unlikely to be associated with GW170814. Our
search finds no candidates associated with GW170814, disfavoring rapidly
declining optical emission from BBH mergers brighter than $i\sim 23$ mag

compact yet comprehensive regional image representations. Intuitively, object
semantics can help build the index that focuses on the most relevant regions.
However, due to the lack of bounding-box datasets for objects of interest among
retrieval benchmarks, most recent work on regional representations has focused
on either uniform or class-agnostic region selection. In this paper, we first
fill the void by providing a new dataset of landmark bounding boxes, based on
the Google Landmarks dataset, that includes $86k$ images with manually curated
boxes from $15k$ unique landmarks. Then, we demonstrate how a trained landmark
detector, using our new dataset, can be leveraged to index image regions and
improve retrieval accuracy while being much more efficient than existing
regional methods. In addition, we introduce a novel regional aggregated
selective match kernel (R-ASMK) to effectively combine information from
detected regions into an improved holistic image representation. R-ASMK boosts
image retrieval accuracy substantially with no dimensionality increase, while
even outperforming systems that index image regions independently. Our complete
image retrieval system improves upon the previous state-of-the-art by
significant margins on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets. Code and data

called a wheel set if all points but $w$ are extreme. We show that for the
purpose of counting crossing-free geometric graphs on such a set $P$, it
suffices to know the frequency vector of $P$. While there are roughly $2^n$
distinct order types that correspond to wheel sets, the number of frequency
vectors is only about $2^{n/2}$.
  We give simple formulas in terms of the frequency vector for the number of
crossing-free spanning cycles, matchings, triangulations, and many more. Based
on that, the corresponding numbers of graphs can be computed efficiently. In
particular, we rediscover an already known formula for $w$-embracing triangles
spanned by $H$.
  Also in higher dimensions, wheel sets turn out to be a suitable model to
approach the problem of computing the simplicial depth of a point $w$ in a set
$H$, i.e., the number of $w$-embracing simplices. While our previous arguments
in the plane do not generalize easily, we show how to use similar ideas in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ for any fixed $d$. The result is an $O(n^{d-1})$ time algorithm
for computing the simplicial depth of a point $w$ in a set $H$ of $n$ points,
improving on the previously best bound of $O(n^d\log n)$.
  Based on our result about simplicial depth, we can compute the number of
facets of the convex hull of $n=d+k$ points in general position in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ in time $O(n^{\max\{\omega,k-2\}})$ where $\omega \approx
2.373$, even though the asymptotic number of facets may be as large as $n^k$.

spacetime are causal diamonds admitting a true Killing field, and they behave
as thermodynamic equilibrium states under gravitational perturbations. We
explore the extension of this gravitational thermodynamics to all causal
diamonds in maximally symmetric spacetimes. Although such diamonds generally
admit only a conformal Killing vector, that seems in all respects to be
sufficient. We establish a Smarr formula for such diamonds and a ""first law""
for variations to nearby solutions. The latter relates the variations of the
bounding area, spatial volume of the maximal slice, cosmological constant, and
matter Hamiltonian. The total Hamiltonian is the generator of evolution along
the conformal Killing vector that preserves the diamond. To interpret the first
law as a thermodynamic relation, it appears necessary to attribute a negative
temperature to the diamond, as has been previously suggested for the special
case of the static patch of de Sitter spacetime. With quantum corrections
included, for small diamonds we recover the ""entanglement equilibrium"" result
that the generalized entropy is stationary at the maximally symmetric vacuum at
fixed volume, and we reformulate this as the stationarity of free conformal
energy with the volume not fixed.

evaluation of two popular smart home platforms, Google's Nest platform and

programs involving apps and devices) via manipulation of state variables in a
centralized data store. Our semi-automated analysis examines, among other
things, platform access control enforcement, the rigor of non-system

results in ten key findings with serious security implications. For instance,
we demonstrate the potential for the misuse of smart home routines in the Nest
platform to perform a lateral privilege escalation, illustrate how Nest's
product review system is ineffective at preventing multiple stages of this
attack that it examines, and demonstrate how emerging platforms may fail to
provide even bare-minimum security by allowing apps to arbitrarily add/remove
other apps from the user's smart home. Our findings draw attention to the
unique security challenges of platforms that execute routines via centralized

for deep-learning based object detectors. Instead of processing an entire image
pyramid, AutoFocus adopts a coarse to fine approach and only processes regions
which are likely to contain small objects at finer scales. This is achieved by
predicting category agnostic segmentation maps for small objects at coarser
scales, called FocusPixels. FocusPixels can be predicted with high recall, and
in many cases, they only cover a small fraction of the entire image. To make
efficient use of FocusPixels, an algorithm is proposed which generates compact
rectangular FocusChips which enclose FocusPixels. The detector is only applied
inside FocusChips, which reduces computation while processing finer scales.
Different types of error can arise when detections from FocusChips of multiple
scales are combined, hence techniques to correct them are proposed. AutoFocus
obtains an mAP of 47.9% (68.3% at 50% overlap) on the COCO test-dev set while
processing 6.4 images per second on a Titan X (Pascal) GPU. This is 2.5X faster
than our multi-scale baseline detector and matches its mAP. The number of

  Distances","25 pages",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The diameter of a graph is one if its most important parameters, being used
in many real-word applications. In particular, the diameter dictates how fast
information can spread throughout data and communication networks. Thus, it is
a natural question to ask how much can we sparsify a graph and still guarantee
that its diameter remains preserved within an approximation $t$. This property
is captured by the notion of extremal-distance spanners. Given a graph
$G=(V,E)$, a subgraph $H=(V,E_H)$ is defined to be a $t$-diameter spanner if
the diameter of $H$ is at most $t$ times the diameter of $G$.
  We show that for any $n$-vertex and $m$-edges directed graph $G$, we can
compute a sparse subgraph $H$ that is a $(1.5)$-diameter spanner of $G$, such
that $H$ contains at most $\tilde O(n^{1.5})$ edges. We also show that the
stretch factor cannot be improved to $(1.5-\epsilon)$. For a graph whose
diameter is bounded by some constant, we show the existence of
$\frac{5}{3}$-diameter spanner that contains at most $\tilde O(n^\frac{4}{3})$
edges. We also show that this bound is tight.
  Additionally, we present other types of extremal-distance spanners, such as
$2$-eccentricity spanners and $2$-radius spanners, both contain only $\tilde
O(n)$ edges and are computable in $\tilde O(m)$ time.
  Finally, we study extremal-distance spanners in the dynamic and
fault-tolerant settings. An interesting implication of our work is the first
$\tilde O(m)$-time algorithm for computing $2$-approximation of vertex
eccentricities in general directed weighted graphs. Backurs et al. [STOC 2018]
gave an $\tilde O(m\sqrt{n})$ time algorithm for this problem, and also showed
that no $O(n^{2-o(1)})$ time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor
better than $2$ for graph eccentricities, unless SETH fails; this shows that
our approximation factor is essentially tight.

together with the existence of reflections and interference -- makes the
prediction problem non-trivial. A network capable of making approximate

wave propagation. To this aim, we created a novel dataset of simulated wave
motion and built a predictive deep neural network comprising of three main
blocks: an encoder, a propagator made by 3 LSTMs, and a decoder. Results show
reasonable predictions for as long as 80 time steps into the future on a

(AGN), is now a cornerstone of galaxy formation models. In this work, we
present radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of radiative AGN feedback using the
novel Arepo-RT. A central black hole emits radiation at a constant luminosity
and drives an outflow via radiation pressure on dust grains. Utilising an
isolated NFW halo we validate our setup in the single and multi-scattering
regimes, with the simulated shock front propagation in excellent agreement with
the expected analytic result. For a spherically symmetric NFW halo, an
examination of the simulated outflow properties generated by radiative feedback
demonstrates that they are lower than typically observed at a fixed AGN
luminosity, regardless of the collimation of the radiation. We then explore the
impact of a central disc galaxy and the assumed dust model on the outflow
properties. The contraction of the halo during the galaxy's formation and
modelling the production of dust grains results in a factor $100$ increase in
the halo's optical depth. Radiation is then able to couple momentum more
efficiently to the gas, driving a stronger shock and producing a mass-loaded
$\sim10^{3}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ outflow with a velocity of
$\sim2000\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, in agreement with observations.
However, the inclusion of dust destruction mechanisms, like thermal sputtering,
leads to the rapid destruction of dust grains within the outflow, reducing its
properties below typically observed values. We conclude that radiative AGN
feedback can drive outflows, but a thorough numerical and physical treatment is
required to assess its true impact.

Kennicutt-Schmidt relation closer to the observational estimates. Radiation
feedback coupled with SNe is more efficient at driving outflows with the mass
and energy loading increasing by a factor of $\sim 10$. This increase is mainly
driven by the additional entrainment of medium density ($10^{-2} \leq n< 1 \

Therefore including radiation fields tends to launch colder, denser and higher

density gas around a newly formed star over-pressurises the region, causing it
to expand. This reduces the ambient density in which the SNe explode by a
factor of $10-100$ which in turn increases their momentum output by a factor of
$\sim 1.5-2.5$. Finally, we note that in these low gas surface density
environments, radiation fields primarily impact the ISM via photoheating and
radiation pressure has only a minimal role in regulating star formation.

interstellar medium, gravitational dynamics, stellar evolution, and cosmology.
Here we review observations and theoretical models for the formation,
evolution, and eventual disruption of star clusters. Current literature
suggests a picture of this life cycle with several phases: (1) Clusters form in
hierarchically-structured, accreting molecular clouds that convert gas into
stars at a low rate per dynamical time until feedback disperses the gas. (2)
The densest parts of the hierarchy resist gas removal long enough to reach high
star formation efficiency, becoming dynamically-relaxed and well-mixed. These
remain bound after gas removal. (3) In the first $\sim 100$ Myr after gas
removal, clusters disperse moderately fast, through a combination of mass loss
and tidal shocks by dense molecular structures in the star-forming environment.
(4) After $\sim 100$ Myr, clusters lose mass via two-body relaxation and shocks
by giant molecular clouds, processes that preferentially affect low-mass
clusters and cause a turnover in the cluster mass function to appear on $\sim
1-10$ Gyr timescales. (5) Even after dispersal, some clusters remain coherent
and thus detectable in chemical or action space for multiple galactic orbits.
In the next decade a new generation of space- and AO-assisted ground-based
telescopes will enable us to test and refine this picture.

and are among the most promising candidates for scalable quantum photonic
circuits. However, geometric differences in each quantum dot leads to slightly
different emission wavelengths and hinders the possibility of generating
multiple identical quantum emitters on the same chip. Stark tuning is an
efficient technique to overcome this issue as it can control the emission
energy of individual quantum dots through the quantum-confined Stark effect.
Realizing this technique in InAs/InP quantum dots has previously been limited
to shifts of less than 0.8 meV due to jumps in the emission energy because of
additional charges at high electric field intensities. We demonstrate up to 5.1
meV of Stark tuning in the emission wavelength of InAs/InP quantum dots. To
eliminate undesirable jumps to charged state, we use a thin oxide insulator to
prevent carrier injection from the contacts, thereby significantly improves the
tuning range of the Stark effect. Moreover, the single-photon nature and narrow
linewidth of the quantum dot emission is preserved under a wide range of
applied electric fields. Using photoluminescence intensity measurements and
time-resolved lifetime spectroscopy we confirmed that this Stark tuning range
is limited by carrier tunneling at high electric fields. This result is an
important step toward integrating multiple identical quantum emitters at
telecom wavelengths on-a-chip, which is crucial for realizing complex quantum
photonic circuits for quantum information processing.

each pixel has an opacity, ranging from transparent to opaque, which we infer
from the light curve. We explore three interesting degeneracies inherent to
this problem, in which markedly different transiting shapes can produce
identical light curves: (i) the ""flip"" degeneracy, by which two pixels
transiting at the same impact parameter on opposite sides of the star's
horizontal midplane generate the same light curve; (ii) the ""arc"" degeneracy,
by which opacity can be redistributed along the semicircular arc of pixels
which undergoes ingress or egress at the same time without consequence to the
light curve, and (iii) the ""stretch"" degeneracy, by which a wide shape moving
fast can produce the same light curve as a narrow shape moving more slowly. By
understanding these degeneracies and adopting some additional assumptions, we
are able to numerically recover informative shadow images of transiting
objects, and we explore a number of different algorithmic approaches to this

(VLBI), which is the technique capable of providing the highest resolution
images in astronomy, is orbit determination of the mission's space radio
telescope(s). In order to successfully detect interference fringes that result
from correlation of the signals recorded by a ground-based and a space-borne
radio telescope, the propagation delays experienced in the near-Earth space by
radio waves emitted by the source and the relativity effects on each
telescope's clock need to be evaluated, which requires accurate knowledge of
position and velocity of the space radio telescope. In this paper we describe
our approach to orbit determination (OD) of the RadioAstron spacecraft of the
RadioAstron space-VLBI mission. Determining RadioAstron's orbit is complicated
due to several factors: strong solar radiation pressure, a highly eccentric
orbit, and frequent orbit perturbations caused by the attitude control system.
We show that in order to maintain the OD accuracy required for processing
space-VLBI observations at cm-wavelengths it is required to take into account
the additional data on thruster firings, reaction wheel rotation rates, and
attitude of the spacecraft. We also investigate into using the unique orbit
data available only for a space-VLBI spacecraft, i.e. the residual delays and
delay rates that result from VLBI data processing, as a means to evaluate the
achieved OD accuracy. We present the results of the first experience of OD
accuracy evaluation of this kind, using more than 5,000 residual values
obtained as a result of space-VLBI observations performed over 7 years of the

equilibrium stellar tides. While dynamical stellar tides are possible, they
require a subgiant structure for the star, whereas stellar models point toward
a main sequence host. Here, we show that these hitherto irreconcilable
observations might be explained by planetary obliquity tides if planet b's spin
vector is trapped in a high-obliquity state maintained by a secular spin-orbit
resonance with an unseen exterior perturbing planet. We derive constraints on
the obliquity ($\epsilon\gtrsim50^{\circ}$), reduced tidal quality factor
($Q^{\prime}\sim10^{6}-10^{7}$), and perturbing planet parameters
($M_{2}\sim10-20M_{\oplus}$, $a_2\lesssim0.04\,{\rm AU}$) required to generate
the observed orbital decay. Direct N-body simulations that include tidal and
spin dynamics reinforce the plausibility of the scenario. Furthermore, we show
that the resonance could have been captured when planet b's obliquity was
small, making the proposed sequence of events easy to explain. The hypothetical
perturbing planet is within the limits of current radial velocity constraints
on the system yet is also detectable. If it exists, it could provide evidence
in favor of the in situ formation hypothesis for hot Jupiters.

three-dimensional numerical simulations. Each model exhibits circumstellar
disks, spiral arms, and a circumbinary disk with an inner gap or cavity. The
circumbinary disk has an asymmetric pattern rotating at an angular velocity of
approximately one-fourth of the binary orbit of the moderate-temperature
models. Because of this asymmetry, the circumbinary disk has a density bump and
a vortex, both of which continue to exist until the end of our calculation. The
density bump and vortex are attributed to enhanced angular momentum, which is
promoted by the gravitational torque of the stars. In a hot model ($c \ge
2.0$), the asymmetry rotates considerably more slowly than in the
moderate-temperature models. The cold models ($c \le 0.02$) exhibit eccentric
circumbinary disks, the precession of which is approximated by a secular motion
of the ballistic particles. The asymmetry in the circumbinary disk does not
depend on the mass ratio, but it becomes less clear as the specific angular
momentum of the infalling envelope increases. The relative accretion rate onto
the stars is sensitive to the angular momentum of the infalling envelope. For
envelopes with constant angular momentum, the secondary tends to have a higher
accretion rate than the primary, except in very low angular momentum cases. For
envelopes with a constant angular velocity, the primary has a higher accretion
rate than the secondary because gas with low specific angular momentum falls
along the polar directions.

deep neural network forgets the knowledge acquired from the former task after
learning on subsequent tasks. However, existing methods try to find the joint
distribution of parameters shared with all tasks. This idea can be questionable
because this joint distribution may not present when the number of tasks
increase. On the other hand, It also leads to ""long-term"" memory issue when the
network capacity is limited since adding tasks will ""eat"" the network capacity.
In this paper, we proposed a Soft Parameters Pruning (SPP) strategy to reach
the trade-off between short-term and long-term profit of a learning model by
freeing those parameters less contributing to remember former task domain
knowledge to learn future tasks, and preserving memories about previous tasks
via those parameters effectively encoding knowledge about tasks at the same
time. The SPP also measures the importance of parameters by information entropy
in a label free manner. The experiments on several tasks shows SPP model
achieved the best performance compared with others state-of-the-art methods.
Experiment results also indicate that our method is less sensitive to
hyper-parameter and better generalization. Our research suggests that a softer
strategy, i.e. approximate optimize or sub-optimal solution, will benefit
alleviating the dilemma of memory. The source codes are available at

critical domains such as autonomous driving, where failures can have
catastrophic consequences. We focus on two problems: searching for scenarios
when learned agents fail and assessing their probability of failure. The
standard method for agent evaluation in reinforcement learning, Vanilla Monte
Carlo, can miss failures entirely, leading to the deployment of unsafe agents.
We demonstrate this is an issue for current agents, where even matching the
compute used for training is sometimes insufficient for evaluation. To address
this shortcoming, we draw upon the rare event probability estimation literature
and propose an adversarial evaluation approach. Our approach focuses evaluation
on adversarially chosen situations, while still providing unbiased estimates of
failure probabilities. The key difficulty is in identifying these adversarial
situations -- since failures are rare there is little signal to drive
optimization. To solve this we propose a continuation approach that learns
failure modes in related but less robust agents. Our approach also allows reuse
of data already collected for training the agent. We demonstrate the efficacy
of adversarial evaluation on two standard domains: humanoid control and
simulated driving. Experimental results show that our methods can find
catastrophic failures and estimate failures rates of agents multiple orders of
magnitude faster than standard evaluation schemes, in minutes to hours rather
than days.

when luminosity functions are considered. These parameters are used to build a

quantum critical phenomena intermediate between those of the clean and randomly

the quasi-periodically (QP) modulated transverse field Ising chain, we provide
evidence for the conjectures of Ref. [Crowley et. al. 2018] regarding the
QP-Ising universality class. In the generic case, we confirm that the
logarithmic wandering coefficient $w$ governs both the macroscopic critical
exponents and the energy-dependent localisation length of the critical
excitations. However, for special values of the phase difference $\Delta$
between the exchange and transverse field couplings, the QP-Ising transition
has different properties. For $\Delta=0$, a generalised Aubry-Andr\'e duality
prevents the finite energy excitations from localising despite the presence of
logarithmic wandering. For $\Delta$ such that the fields and couplings are
related by a lattice shift, the wandering coefficient $w$ vanishes.
Nonetheless, the presence of small couplings leads to non-trivial exponents and
localised excitations. Our results add to the rich menagerie of quantum Ising
transitions in the presence of spatial modulation.

  Dataset link: http://gonglab.pratt.duke.edu/code-data",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many security and privacy problems can be modeled as a graph classification
problem, where nodes in the graph are classified by collective classification
simultaneously. State-of-the-art collective classification methods for such
graph-based security and privacy analytics follow the following paradigm:
assign weights to edges of the graph, iteratively propagate reputation scores
of nodes among the weighted graph, and use the final reputation scores to
classify nodes in the graph. The key challenge is to assign edge weights such
that an edge has a large weight if the two corresponding nodes have the same
label, and a small weight otherwise. Although collective classification has
been studied and applied for security and privacy problems for more than a
decade, how to address this challenge is still an open question. In this work,
we propose a novel collective classification framework to address this
long-standing challenge. We first formulate learning edge weights as an
optimization problem, which quantifies the goals about the final reputation
scores that we aim to achieve. However, it is computationally hard to solve the
optimization problem because the final reputation scores depend on the edge
weights in a very complex way. To address the computational challenge, we
propose to jointly learn the edge weights and propagate the reputation scores,
which is essentially an approximate solution to the optimization problem. We
compare our framework with state-of-the-art methods for graph-based security
and privacy analytics using four large-scale real-world datasets from various
application scenarios such as Sybil detection in social networks, fake review
detection in Yelp, and attribute inference attacks. Our results demonstrate
that our framework achieves higher accuracies than state-of-the-art methods

variety of optimized backends, realizing the best performance using a backend
may require additional efforts. For instance, getting the best performance from
a CPU backend requires careful tuning of its threading model. Unfortunately,
the best tuning approach used today is manual, tedious, time-consuming, and,
more importantly, may not guarantee the best performance.
  In this paper, we develop an automatic approach, called TensorTuner, to
search for optimal parameter settings of TensorFlow's threading model for CPU
backends. We evaluate TensorTuner on both Eigen and Intel's MKL CPU backends
using a set of neural networks from TensorFlow's benchmarking suite. Our
evaluation results demonstrate that the parameter settings found by TensorTuner
produce 2% to 123% performance improvement for the Eigen CPU backend and 1.5%
to 28% performance improvement for the MKL CPU backend over the performance
obtained using their best-known parameter settings. This highlights the fact
that the default parameter settings in Eigen CPU backend are not the ideal
settings; and even for a carefully hand-tuned MKL backend, the settings may be
sub-optimal. Our evaluations also revealed that TensorTuner is efficient at
finding the optimal settings --- it is able to converge to the optimal settings
quickly by pruning more than 90% of the parameter search space.

dispersed. A single strong pulse can leave previously buried boulders stranded
on the surface. Boulder stranding due to an impact excited seismic pulse is an
additional mechanism that could leave large boulders present on the surface of
rubble asteroids such as 162173 Ryugu, 101955 Bennu and 25143 Itokawa.

  type implications","43 pages",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper aims to study in more depth the relation between growth in matrix
groups ${{\rm SL_2}}(\mathbf{F})$ and ${{\rm Aff}}(\mathbf{F})$ over a field
$\mathbf{F}$ by multiplication and geometric incidence estimates, associated
with the sum-product phenomenon over $\mathbf{F}$. It presents streamlined
proofs of Helfgott's theorems on growth in the $\mathbf{F}_p$-case, which avoid
sum-product estimates. For ${{\rm SL_2}}(\mathbf{F}_p)$, for sets exceeding in
size some absolute constant, we improve the lower bound $\frac{1}{1512}$ for
the growth exponent, due to Kowalski, to $\frac{1}{21}.$ For the affine group
we fetch a sharp theorem of Sz\H{o}nyi on the number of directions, determined
by a point set in $\mathbf{F}_p^2$.
  We then focus on ${{\rm Aff}}(\mathbf{F})$ and present a new incidence bound
between a set of points and a set of lines in $\mathbf{F}^2$, which explicitly
depends on the energy of the set of lines as affine transformations under
composition. This bound, strong when the number of lines is considerably
smaller than the number of points, yields generalizations of structural
theorems of Elekes and Murphy on rich lines in grids.
  In the special case when the set of lines is also a grid -- relating back to
sum-products -- we use growth in ${{\rm Aff}}(\mathbf{R})$ to obtain a
subthreshold estimate on the energy of the set of lines. This yields a unified
way to break the ice in various threshold sum-product type energy inequalities.
We show this in applications to energy estimates, corresponding to sets $A(A+
A)$, $A+AA$ (also embracing asymmetric versions) as well as $A+B$ when $A$ has
small multiplicative doubling and $\sqrt{|A|} \le |B|\le|A|^{1+o(1)}$.

splits a CNN model into two parts: a set of layers that are fixed in the
hardware platform as a front-end fixed-weight feature extractor, and the
remaining layers which become a back-end classifier running on a conventional

features for all FixyNN models, while the back-end is programmable and specific

end-to-end via transfer learning, with front-end layers fixed for the shared

Cahn-Hilliard system. The operators appearing in the system equations were
fractional versions in the spectral sense of general linear operators A and B
having compact resolvents and are densely defined, unbounded, selfadjoint, and
monotone in a Hilbert space of functions defined in a smooth domain. The
associated double-well potentials driving the phase separation process modeled
by the Cahn-Hilliard system could be of a very general type that includes
standard physically meaningful cases such as polynomial, logarithmic, and
double obstacle nonlinearities. In the subsequent paper arXiv:1807.03218, an
analysis of distributed optimal control problems was performed for such
evolutionary systems, where only the differentiable case of certain polynomial
and logarithmic double-well potentials could be admitted. Results concerning
existence of optimizers and first-order necessary optimality conditions were
derived. In the present paper, we complement these results by studying a
distributed control problem for such evolutionary systems in the case of
nondifferentiable nonlinearities of double obstacle type. For such
nonlinearities, it is well known that the standard constraint qualifications
cannot be applied to construct appropriate Lagrange multipliers. To overcome
this difficulty, we follow here the so-called ""deep quench"" method. We first
give a general convergence analysis of the deep quench approximation that
includes an error estimate and then demonstrate that its use leads in the
double obstacle case to appropriate first-order necessary optimality conditions

sample is supplemented with optical weak gravitational lensing measurements of
32 clusters with $0.29<z<1.13$ (from Magellan and HST) and X-ray measurements
of 89 clusters with $0.25<z<1.75$ (from Chandra). We rely on minimal modeling
assumptions: i) weak lensing provides an accurate means of measuring halo
masses, ii) the mean SZ and X-ray observables are related to the true halo mass
through power-law relations in mass and dimensionless Hubble parameter $E(z)$
with a-priori unknown parameters, iii) there is (correlated, lognormal)
intrinsic scatter and measurement noise relating these observables to their
mean relations. We simultaneously fit for these astrophysical modeling
parameters and for cosmology. Assuming a flat $\nu\Lambda$CDM model, in which
the sum of neutrino masses is a free parameter, we measure
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.276\pm0.047$, $\sigma_8=0.781\pm0.037$, and
$\sigma_8(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.2}=0.766\pm0.025$. The redshift evolution
of the X-ray $Y_\mathrm{X}$-mass and $M_\mathrm{gas}$-mass relations are both
consistent with self-similar evolution to within $1\sigma$. The mass-slope of
the $Y_\mathrm{X}$-mass relation shows a $2.3\sigma$ deviation from
self-similarity. Similarly, the mass-slope of the $M_\mathrm{gas}$-mass
relation is steeper than self-similarity at the $2.5\sigma$ level. In a $\nu
w$CDM cosmology, we measure the dark energy equation of state parameter
$w=-1.55\pm0.41$ from the cluster data. We perform a measurement of the growth
of structure since redshift $z\sim1.7$ and find no evidence for tension with
the prediction from General Relativity. We provide updated redshift and mass

line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are under debate. Theoretical
studies show a possible connection between the dust torus and BLR through a
common origin in the accretion disk. However observationally the dust torus and
BLR are typically studied separately. NGC~4151 is possibly one of the best
suited Seyfert~1 galaxies for simultaneous examinations because of its high
number of both photometric and spectroscopic observations in the past. Here we
compare changes of the dust radius to shape variations of broad emission lines
(BEL). While the radius of the dust torus decreased by almost a factor of two
from 2004 to 2006 shape variations can be seen in the red wing of BELs of
NGC~4151. These simultaneous changes are discussed in a dust and BEL formation
scheme. We also use the BEL shape variations to assess possible cloud
distributions, especially in azimuthal direction, which could be responsible
for the observed variations. Our findings can best be explained in the
framework of a dust inflated accretion disk. The changes in the BELs suggest
that this dusty cloud formation does not happen continuously, and over the
whole accretion disk, but on the contrary in spatially confined areas over
rather short amount of times. We derive limits to the azimuthal extension of
the observed localized BEL flux enhancement event.

singularities in the Jordan frame. In other words, we show that, at least in
the context of Bianchi I cosmologies, the Einstein frame is available only when
the original formulation in the Jordan frame is free of anisotropic
singularities. Furthermore, we present a novel dynamical system formulation for
anisotropic cosmologies in which both frames, provided they exist, will be
manifestly equivalent from the dynamical point of view, even though they fail
to be diffeomorphic in general. Our results could help not only the
construction of viable (free of anisotropic singularities) $f(R)$ cosmological
models, but also contribute to the still active debate on the physical
interpretation of the two frames.

simple alternative approach to the auto-balanced Ramsey (ABR) interrogation
protocol and demonstrate its application to a cold-atom microwave clock based
on coherent population trapping. The main originality of the method, based on
two consecutive Ramsey sequences with different dark periods, is to sample the
central Ramsey fringes with frequency-jumps finely-adjusted by an additional
frequency-displacement concomitant parameter, scaling as the inverse of the
dark-period. The advantage of this displaced frequency-jumps Ramsey (DFJR)
method is that the local oscillator frequency is used as a single physical
variable to control both servo loops of the sequence, simplifying its
implementation and avoiding noise associated with controlling the LO phase.
Compared to the usual Ramsey-CPT technique, the DFJR scheme reduces the
sensitivity of the clock frequency to variations of the CPT sideband ratio and
to the one-photon laser detuning by more than an order of magnitude. This
simple method could be applied in a wide variety of Ramsey-spectroscopy based
applications including frequency metrology with CPT-based and optical atomic
clocks, mass spectrometry, and precision spectroscopy.

formulation of monopole operators and their connection with topological states
of matter. In quantum field theory it is known that certain states describe
collective modes of the fundamental fields and are created by operators that
are often non-local, being defined over lines or higher-dimensional surfaces.
For this reason, they may be sensitive to global, topological, properties of
the system and depend on nonperturbative data. Such operators are generally
known as monopole operators. Sometimes they act as disorder operators because
their nonzero expectation values define a disordered vacuum associated with a
condensate of the collective modes, also known as defects. In this work we
investigate the definition of these operators and their relation to the
multivalued properties of the fundamental fields. We study several examples of
scalar field theories and generalize the discussion to $p$-forms, with the main
purpose of studying new field configurations that may be related to topological
states of matter. We specifically investigate the so-called chiral vortex
configurations in topological superconductors. We highlight an important aspect
of this formalism, which is the splitting of the fields in their regular and
singular parts that identifies an ambiguity that can be explored, much like
gauge symmetry, in order to define observables.

possibly born out of the death of a massive star. After the star collapses, a
stellar-mass black hole (BH) is formed, surrounded by a hyperaccretion disk
with outflows. Blandford-Znajek jets can be launched and then break out from
the envelope to power LGRBs. The jet luminosity depends on the net inflow
accretion rate at the inner radius of the disk. Furthermore, $\rm ^{56}Ni$
synthesis should occur in the strong outflows from the accretion disk. The
decay of $\rm ^{56}Ni$ is considered to be the possible origin of SN bumps in
the subsequent optical afterglows of LGRBs. If $\rm ^{56}Ni$ originates
entirely from the outflows, there is competition between the luminosities of
LGRBs and those of the corresponding $\rm ^{56}Ni$ bumps because of the
material distribution between the disk inflows and outflows. In this paper, we
investigated these two luminosities based on 15 cases of LGRB-SN in the
framework of the BH hyperaccretion inflow-outflow model. Then, one can
constrain the characteristics of the progenitor stars of these LGRBs. The
results indicate that these LGRBs may originate from the low-metallicity
($Z\lesssim 10^{-2}Z_{\odot}$, where $Z$ and $Z_{\odot}$ are the metallicities
of the stars and the Sun, respectively) stars or some massive solar-metallicity
stars. For ultra-LGRBs (ULGRBs), such as GRB 111209A, most of the massive
low-metallicity stars with $Z \lesssim 10^{-2}Z_{\odot}$ could be progenitors
only if very strong outflows are launched from the disks. When the
contributions of nucleosynthesis in the disk outflows are considered, there is
no shortage of $\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass for luminous SNe associated with ULGRBs.

describes the risk of rare events through asymptotically justified limit models

in this field has been limited to moderate dimensions so far, partly owing to
complicated likelihoods and a lack of understanding of the underlying
probabilistic structures. We introduce a general theory of conditional
independence for multivariate Pareto distributions that allows the definition
of graphical models and sparsity for extremes. A Hammersley-Clifford theorem
links this new notion to the factorization of densities of extreme value models
on graphs. For the popular class of H\""usler-Reiss distributions we show that,
similarly to the Gaussian case, the sparsity pattern of a general extremal
graphical model can be read off from suitable inverse covariance matrices. New
parametric models can be built in a modular way and statistical inference can

context, it is hard for supervised learning systems to generalize to the cases
that are rare in the training set but would be present in real-world clinical
practices. We believe that the synthetic image samples generated by a system
trained on the real data can be useful for improving the supervised learning
tasks in the medical image analysis applications. Allowing the image synthesis
to be manipulable could help synthetic images provide complementary information
to the training data rather than simply duplicating the real-data manifold. In
this paper, we propose a framework for synthesizing 3D objects, such as
pulmonary nodules, in 3D medical images with manipulable properties. The
manipulation is enabled by decomposing of the object of interests into its
segmentation mask and a 1D vector containing the residual information. The
synthetic object is refined and blended into the image context with two
adversarial discriminators. We evaluate the proposed framework on lung nodules
in 3D chest CT images and show that the proposed framework could generate
realistic nodules with manipulable shapes, textures and locations, etc. By
sampling from both the synthetic nodules and the real nodules from 2800 3D CT

it is possible to leverage multiview image streams that are linked through the
underlying 3D geometry, which can provide an additional supervisionary signal
to train a segmentation model. We formulate a new cross-supervision method
using a shape belief transfer---the segmentation belief in one image is used to
predict that of the other image through epipolar geometry analogous to
shape-from-silhouette. The shape belief transfer provides the upper and lower
bounds of the segmentation for the unlabeled data where its gap approaches
asymptotically to zero as the number of the labeled views increases. We
integrate this theory to design a novel network that is agnostic to camera

process of suboptimal 3D reconstruction. We validate this network by
recognizing a customized semantic category per pixel from realworld visual data

Existing approaches, however, exhibit many limitations including high
computational complexity, imperfect security, and information leakage. This
chapter describes an emerging trend in secure data processing that recognizes
that an entire dataset may not be sensitive, and hence, non-sensitivity of data
can be exploited to overcome some of the limitations of existing
encryption-based approaches. In particular, data and computation can be
partitioned into sensitive or non-sensitive datasets - sensitive data can
either be encrypted prior to outsourcing or stored/processed locally on trusted
servers. The non-sensitive dataset, on the other hand, can be outsourced and
processed in the cleartext. While partitioned computing can bring new
efficiencies since it does not incur (expensive) encrypted data processing
costs on non-sensitive data, it can lead to information leakage. We study
partitioned computing in two contexts - first, in the context of the hybrid
cloud where local resources are integrated with public cloud resources to form
an effective and secure storage and computational platform for enterprise data.
In the hybrid cloud, sensitive data is stored on the private cloud to prevent
leakage and a computation is partitioned between private and public clouds.
Care must be taken that the public cloud cannot infer any information about
sensitive data from inter-cloud data access during query processing. We then
consider partitioned computing in a public cloud only setting, where sensitive
data is encrypted before outsourcing. We formally define a partitioned security
criterion that any approach to partitioned computing on public clouds must
ensure in order to not introduce any new vulnerabilities to the existing secure
solution.

variations in lighting and pose (etc.) but on the other hand could potentially
provide key context (e.g. the user's body type, or the season) for making more
accurate recommendations. In this work, we propose a new task called 'Complete
the Look', which seeks to recommend visually compatible products based on scene
images. We design an approach to extract training data for this task, and
propose a novel way to learn the scene-product compatibility from fashion or
interior design images. Our approach measures compatibility both globally and
locally via CNNs and attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that our
method achieves significant performance gains over alternative systems. Human
evaluation and qualitative analysis are also conducted to further understand
model behavior. We hope this work could lead to useful applications which link
large corpora of real-world scenes with shoppable products.

this paper, we use stochastic geometry to analyze the performance of uplink
cellular IoT using different deployment strategies of aggregators, including
terrestrial and aerial ones, e.g., drones or unmanned aerial vehicles. We focus
on IoT-specific performance metrics, that are typically used by 3GPP.
Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions of the average transmit power

the maximum coupling loss, which is essential to determine the maximum coverage
the cellular system can support. Simulation results are presented to validate
the derived theoretical expressions. It is shown that aerial aggregators can
significantly extend the device lifetime and provide superior coverage compared
to other deployment strategies. In addition, random deployment performs well
when aggregators are densely deployed, whereas optimizing the location of a
single terrestrial aggregator is beneficial when devices are more clustered.

The input is an asymmetric metric $(V,c)$, root $r^{*}\in V$, monotone

to find an $r^{*}$-rooted arborescence $T$ of cost at most $B$ that maximizes

the number of vertices in an optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first non-trivial approximation ratio for this problem. As a
consequence we obtain an $O(\frac{\log^2 k}{\log\log k})$-approximation
algorithm for directed (polymatroid) Steiner tree in quasi-polynomial time. We
also extend our main result to a setting with additional length bounds at
vertices, which leads to improved $O(\frac{\log^2 k}{\log\log

Steiner tree problems. For the usual directed Steiner tree problem, our result
matches the best previous approximation ratio [GLL19]. Our algorithm has the
advantage of being deterministic and faster: the runtime is $\exp(O(\log n\,

incorrectly initialized non-linear filter is said to be stable if the filter
eventually corrects itself with the arrival of new measurement information.
Numerous examples are presented and a detailed comparison with the literature

radiation pressure due to spectral lines. Although straightforward to

the strength, spectral energy distribution (SED), and geometry of the radiation
field. We present results from our photoionization and radiation transfer
calculations of the force multiplier, $M(\xi,t)$, using the same radiation
field to compute the gas photoionization and thermal balance. We assume low gas
density ($n = 10^4~\rm{cm^{-3}}$) and column density ($N \leq 10^{17}~\rm{
cm^{-2}}$), a Boltzmann distribution for the level populations, and the Sobolev
approximation. Here, we describe results for two SEDs corresponding to an
unobscured and obscured AGN in NGC 5548. Our main results are the following: 1)
although $M(\xi,t)$ starts to decrease with $\xi$ for $\xi \gtrsim 1$ as shown
by others, this decrease in our calculations is relatively gradual and could be
non-monotonic as $M(\xi,t)$ can increase by a factor of few for $\xi \approx
10-1000$; 2) at these same $\xi$ for which the multiplier is higher than in
previous calculations, the gas is thermally unstable by the isobaric criterion;
3) non-LTE effects reduce $M(t,\xi)$ by over two orders of magnitude for $\xi
\gtrsim 100$. The dynamical consequence of result (1) is that line driving can
be important for $\xi$ as high as $1000$ when the LTE approximation holds,
while result (2) provides a natural cloud formation mechanism that may account
for the existence of narrow line regions. Result (3) suggests that line driving
may not be important for $\xi\gtrsim100$ in tenuous plasma.

applied to privacy preservation for collaborative filtering recommendation
algorithms. However, as far as we know, existing differentially private CF
recommendation schemes degraded the recommendation performance (such as recall
and precision) to an unacceptable level. In this paper, in order to address the

(KDPCF). Specifically, to improve the recommendation performance, we first
cluster the dataset into categories by k-means clustering and appropriately
adjust the size of the target category to which the target user belongs, so
that only users in the well-sized target category can be used for
recommendations. Then we efficiently select a set of neighbors from the target
category at one time by employing only one exponential mechanism instead of the
composition of multiple ones, and base on the neighbor set to recommend. We
theoretically prove that our scheme achieves differential privacy. Empirically,
we use the MovieLens dataset to evaluate our recommendation system. The
experimental results demonstrate a significant performance gain compared to
existing schemes.

to our approach is that we align the distributions learned from images and from

fifth generation (5G) small cell networks incorporated with the millimeter wave

than signals in lower frequency bands, which highlights the effect of
anisotropic path loss in network coverage. According to the fractal
characteristics of cellular coverage, a multi-directional path loss model is
proposed for 5G small cell networks, where different directions are subject to
different path loss exponents. Furthermore, the coverage probability,
association probability, and the handoff probability are derived for 5G fractal
small cell networks based on the proposed multi-directional path loss model.
Numerical results indicate that the coverage probability with the
multi-directional path loss model is less than that with the isotropic path
loss model, and the association probability with long link distance, e.g.,
150m, increases obviously with the increase of the effect of anisotropic path
loss in 5G fractal small cell networks. Moreover, it is observed that the
anisotropic propagation environment is having a profound impact on the handoff
performance. Meanwhile, we could conclude that the resulting heavy handoff

  Compression via a Bilinear Regression Model",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many DNN-enabled vision applications constantly operate under severe energy
constraints such as unmanned aerial vehicles, Augmented Reality headsets, and
smartphones. Designing DNNs that can meet a stringent energy budget is becoming
increasingly important. This paper proposes ECC, a framework that compresses
DNNs to meet a given energy constraint while minimizing accuracy loss. The key
idea of ECC is to model the DNN energy consumption via a novel bilinear
regression function. The energy estimate model allows us to formulate DNN
compression as a constrained optimization that minimizes the DNN loss function
over the energy constraint. The optimization problem, however, has nontrivial
constraints. Therefore, existing deep learning solvers do not apply directly.
We propose an optimization algorithm that combines the essence of the
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework with
gradient-based learning algorithms. The algorithm decomposes the original
constrained optimization into several subproblems that are solved iteratively
and efficiently. ECC is also portable across different hardware platforms
without requiring hardware knowledge. Experiments show that ECC achieves higher
accuracy under the same or lower energy budget compared to state-of-the-art
resource-constrained DNN compression techniques.

propose a method for systematically optimizing the rules of adaptive policies

treatment objectives, we use the framework of dynamic programming to find the
optimal treatment strategies. In particular, we optimize the total drug usage

mathematical model of tumor evolution. We compare adaptive/optimal treatment
strategy with MTD-based treatment policy. We show that optimal treatment
strategies can dramatically decrease the total amount of drugs prescribed as
well as increase the fraction of initial tumour states from which the recovery
is possible. We also examine the optimization trade-offs between the total

optimal control theory is a promising concept in the cancer treatment and

We used this information to focus restaurant inspections in two cities and

the amount of data required to learn a classifier, but it has been observed in
practice to converge to different parameters depending on the initialization
and sometimes to even better parameters than standard training on all the data.
In this work, we give a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon, showing
that uncertainty sampling on a convex loss can be interpreted as performing a
preconditioned stochastic gradient step on a smoothed version of the population
zero-one loss that converges to the population zero-one loss. Furthermore,
uncertainty sampling moves in a descent direction and converges to stationary
points of the smoothed population zero-one loss. Experiments on synthetic and
real datasets support this connection.

weight to balance these two terms. In this work, we propose to first transfer
the backbone knowledge from a teacher to the student, and then only learn the

circumvents the need of choosing an appropriate loss weight, which is often
difficult in practice, and thus makes it easier to apply to different datasets

Stage-by-Stage Knowledge Distillation (SSKD), which facilitates progressive
feature mimicking from teacher to student. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100

(CEMP) stars. Carbon enhancement at low stellar metallicities is usually
considered a consequence of faint or other exotic supernovae. An analytical
estimate of cooling times in low-metallicity gas demonstrates a natural bias,
which favours the formation of CEMP stars as a consequence of inhomogeneous
metal mixing: carbon-rich gas has a shorter cooling time and can form stars
prior to a potential nearby pocket of carbon-normal gas, in which star
formation is then suppressed due to energetic photons from the carbon-enhanced
protostars. We demonstrate that this scenario provides a natural formation
mechanism for CEMP stars from carbon-normal supernovae, if inhomogeneous metal
mixing provides carbonicity differences of at least one order of magnitude
separated by >10pc. In our fiducial (optimistic) model, 8% (83%) of observed
CEMP-no stars ([Ba/Fe]<0) can be explained by this formation channel. This new
scenario may change our understanding of the first supernovae and thereby our
concept of the first stars. Future 3D simulations are required to assess the
likelihood of this mechanism to occur in typical high-redshift galaxies.

population estimation theories to compute error bounds for the aggregation.
When information about output keys are available early, the framework can also
use adaptive stratified reservoir sampling to avoid (or reduce) key losses in

sampling rates to meet user specified constraints on the CDF of error bounds in
the outputs. We have implemented a prototype of our framework called
ApproxSpark, and used it to implement five approximate applications from
different domains. Evaluation results show that ApproxSpark can (a)
significantly reduce execution time if users can tolerate small amounts of
uncertainties and, in many cases, loss of rare keys, and (b) automatically find
sampling rates to meet user specified constraints on error bounds. We also

emerged as an appealing way to model and analyze heterogeneous cellular

by the models used in industry -- the PCP's use in performance analysis has
been limited. This is primarily because of the lack of analytical tools to
characterize performance metrics such as the coverage probability of a user
connected to the strongest BS. In this paper, we develop an analytical
framework for the evaluation of the coverage probability, or equivalently the
complementary cumulative density function (CCDF) of

enabling step involves conditioning on the parent PPPs of all the PCPs which
allows us to express the coverage probability as a product of sum-product and
probability generating functionals (PGFLs) of the parent PPPs. In addition to
several useful insights, our analysis provides a rigorous way to study the
impact of the cluster size on the SINR distribution, which was not possible

applications onto the same physical server, thereby enabling more efficient use
of server resources. However, users often statically configure the resources of
virtual machines through guesswork, resulting in either insufficient resource
allocations that hinder VM performance, or excessive allocations that waste
precious data center resources. In this paper, we first characterize real-world
resource allocation and utilization of VMs through the analysis of an extensive
dataset, consisting of more than 250k VMs from over 3.6k private enterprise
clusters. Our large-scale analysis confirms that VMs are often misconfigured,
either overprovisioned or underprovisioned, and that this problem is pervasive
across a wide range of private clusters. We then propose ADARES, an adaptive
system that dynamically adjusts VM resources using machine learning techniques.
In particular, ADARES leverages the contextual bandits framework to effectively
manage the adaptations. Our system exploits easily collectible data, at the
cluster, node, and VM levels, to make more sensible allocation decisions, and
uses transfer learning to safely explore the configurations space and speed up
training. Our empirical evaluation shows that ADARES can significantly improve
system utilization without sacrificing performance. For instance, when compared
to threshold and prediction-based baselines, it achieves more predictable
VM-level performance and also reduces the amount of virtual CPUs and memory
provisioned by up to 35% and 60% respectively for synthetic workloads on real
clusters.

medicine and science has renewed the interest in interpretable machine
learning: many decisions are too important to be delegated to black-box
techniques such as deep neural networks or kernel SVMs. Historically, problems
of learning interpretable classifiers, including classification rules or
decision trees, have been approached by greedy heuristic methods as essentially
all the exact optimization formulations are NP-hard. Our primary contribution
is a MaxSAT-based framework, called MLIC, which allows principled search for
interpretable classification rules expressible in propositional logic. Our
approach benefits from the revolutionary advances in the constraint
satisfaction community to solve large-scale instances of such problems. In
experimental evaluations over a collection of benchmarks arising from practical
scenarios, we demonstrate its effectiveness: we show that the formulation can
solve large classification problems with tens or hundreds of thousands of
examples and thousands of features, and to provide a tunable balance of
accuracy vs. interpretability. Furthermore, we show that in many problems
interpretability can be obtained at only a minor cost in accuracy. The primary
objective of the paper is to show that recent advances in the MaxSAT literature
make it realistic to find optimal (or very high quality near-optimal) solutions
to large-scale classification problems. The key goal of the paper is to excite
researchers in both interpretable classification and in the CP community to
take it further and propose richer formulations, and to develop bespoke solvers
attuned to the problem of interpretable ML.

researchers for monitoring, diagnosing and understanding a network. Traditional
tools like NetFlow face great challenges when both the speed and the complexity
of the network traffic increase. To keep pace up, we propose HashFlow, a tool
for more efficient and accurate collection and analysis of flow records. The
central idea of HashFlow is to maintain accurate records for elephant flows,
but summarized records for mice flows, by applying a novel collision resolution
and record promotion strategy to hash tables. The performance bound can be
analyzed with a probabilistic model, and with this strategy, HashFlow achieves
a better utilization of space, and also more accurate flow records, without
bringing extra complexity. We have implemented HashFlow, as well as several
latest flow measurement algorithms such as FlowRadar, HashPipe and
ElasticSketch, in a P4 software switch. Then we use traces from different
operational networks to evaluate them. In these experiments, for various types
of traffic analysis applications, HashFlow consistently demonstrates a clearly
better performance against its state-of-the-art competitors. For example, using
a small memory of 1 MB, HashFlow can accurately record around 55K flows, which
is often 12.5% higher than the others. For estimating the sizes of 50K flows,
HashFlow achieves a relative error of around 11.6%, while the estimation error
of the best competitor is 42.9% higher. It detects 96.1% of the heavy hitters
out of 250K flows with a size estimation error of 5.6%, which is 11.3% and
73.7% better than the best competitor respectively. At last, we show these
merits of HashFlow come with almost no degradation of throughput.

oxidation, i.e. rapid and complete consumption of the alloy, occurred during
temperature ramp up to above 1200{\deg}C for specific alloys. The maximum
compatible temperature of FeCrAl alloys in steam increases with raising Cr and
Al content, decreasing heating rates during ramp period and doping of yttrium.
Isothermal oxidation resulted in catastrophic oxidation at 1400{\deg}C for all
examined alloys. However, formation of a protective alumina scale at

catastrophic oxidation seems to be controlled by dynamic competitive mechanisms

response is governed by crystal symmetry, and that a one-to-one correspondence
exists between the symmetry of Cooper pairs and the representation of magnetic
multipoles under crystal symmetry. The latter property provides a way to
identify nonconventional pairing symmetry via the magnetic response of surface
MFs. We also find that most helical MFs exhibit a magnetic-dipole response, but
those on superconductors with spin-3/2 electrons may display a
magnetic-octupole response in leading order, which uniquely characterizes
high-spin superconductors. Detection of such an octupole response provides
direct evidence of high-spin superconductivity, such as in half-Heusler
superconductors.

image into a visual context, helping visual reasoning tasks such as scene graph
generation and visual Q&A. Our visual context tree model, dubbed VCTree, has
two key advantages over existing structured object representations including
chains and fully-connected graphs: 1) The efficient and expressive binary tree
encodes the inherent parallel/hierarchical relationships among objects, e.g.,
""clothes"" and ""pants"" are usually co-occur and belong to ""person""; 2) the
dynamic structure varies from image to image and task to task, allowing more
content-/task-specific message passing among objects. To construct a VCTree, we
design a score function that calculates the task-dependent validity between
each object pair, and the tree is the binary version of the maximum spanning
tree from the score matrix. Then, visual contexts are encoded by bidirectional
TreeLSTM and decoded by task-specific models. We develop a hybrid learning
procedure which integrates end-task supervised learning and the tree structure
reinforcement learning, where the former's evaluation result serves as a
self-critic for the latter's structure exploration. Experimental results on two
benchmarks, which require reasoning over contexts: Visual Genome for scene
graph generation and VQA2.0 for visual Q&A, show that VCTree outperforms
state-of-the-art results while discovering interpretable visual context
structures.

separating overall tumbling motion from internal motions and accounting for
contributions of chemical exchange to transverse relaxation. We demonstrate
that internal protein motions can be described with detectors when the overall
motion and the internal motions are statistically independent. We illustrate

investigate the performance characteristics of Discrete Local Sensitivity
Analysis implemented via Automatic Differentiation (DSAAD) against continuous
adjoint sensitivity analysis. Non-stiff and stiff biological and pharmacometric
models, including a PDE discretization, are used to quantify the performance of
sensitivity analysis methods. Our benchmarks show that on small systems of ODEs
(approximately $<100$ parameters+ODEs), forward-mode DSAAD is more efficient
than both reverse-mode and continuous forward/adjoint sensitivity analysis. The
scalability of continuous adjoint methods is shown to be more efficient than
discrete adjoints and forward methods after crossing this size range. These
comparative studies demonstrate a trade-off between memory usage and
performance in the continuous adjoint methods that should be considered when
choosing the technique, while numerically unstable backsolve techniques from
the machine learning literature are demonstrated as unsuitable for most
scientific models. The performance of adjoint methods is shown to be heavily
tied to the reverse-mode AD method, with tape-based AD methods shown to be 2
orders of magnitude slower on nonlinear partial differential equations than
static AD techniques. These results also demonstrate the applicability of DSAAD
to differential-algebraic equations, delay differential equations, and hybrid

found especially within the main portion of fast wind streams while the slow
wind usually is less Alfv\'enic and more variable. In general, fast and slow
wind show many differences which span from the large scale structure to small
scale phenomena including also a different turbulent behaviour. Recent studies,
however, have shown that even slow wind can be sometimes highly Alfv\'enic with
fluctuations as large as those of the fast wind. The present study is devoted
to present many facets of this Alfv\'enic slow solar wind including for example
the study of the source regions and their connection to coronal structures,
large-scale properties and micro-scale phenomena and also impact on the
spectral features. This study will be conducted performing a comparative
analysis with the typical slow wind and with the fast wind. It has been found
that the fast wind and the Alfv\'enic slow wind share common characteristics,
probably attributable to their similar solar origin, i.e. coronal-hole solar
wind. Given these similarities, it is suggested that in the Alfv\'enic slow
wind a major role is played by the super-radial expansion responsible for the
lower velocity. Relevant implications of these new findings for the upcoming
Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus missions, and more in general for turbulence
measurements close to the Sun, will be discussed.

$F$-Polynomials are difficult to understand and have been an area of study for
many years. In this paper, we present a general closed-form formula for these

demonstrate the effectiveness of the formula by using it to derive simple

  Secondly, we investigate convergence of $F$-polynomials. In themselves, they
do not converge, but by changing bases using the $C$-matrix, they conjecturally
do. Since our formula relates $C$-matrix entries to coefficients, we are able
to apply it to make considerable progress on the conjecture. Specifically, we
show stability for green mutation sequences. Finally, we look at exact formulas

important role in many areas of mathematics, logic and theoretical computer
science such as descriptive set theory, complexity theory, and the theory of
regular languages and automata. From a lattice theoretic point of view, the
difference hierarchy over a bounded distributive lattice stratifies the Boolean
algebra generated by it according to the minimum length of difference chains
required to describe the Boolean elements. While each Boolean element is given
by a finite difference chain, there is no canonical such writing in general. We
show that, relative to the filter completion, or equivalently, the lattice of
closed upsets of the dual Priestley space, each Boolean element over the
lattice has a canonical minimum length decomposition into a Hausdorff
difference. As a corollary each Boolean element over a (co-)Heyting algebra has
a canonical difference chain. With a further generalization of this result
involving a directed family of adjunctions with meet-semilattices, we give an
elementary proof of the fact that a regular language is given by a Boolean
combination of purely universal sentences using arbitrary numerical predicates
if and only if it is given by a Boolean combination of purely universal
sentences using only regular numerical predicates.

this end we perform simulations of FPU--trajectories for various classes of
initial conditions produced by the excitation of isolated modes, packets, as
well as `generic' (random) initial data. For initial conditions corresponding
to localized energy excitations, $J$ exhibits variations yielding `sigmoid'
curves similar to observables used in literature, e.g. the `spectral entropy'
or various types of `correlation functions'. However, $J(t)$ is free of
fluctuations inherent in such observables, hence it constitutes an ideal
observable for probing the timescales involved in the stages of FPU dynamics.
We observe two fundamental timescales: i) the `time of stability' (in which,
roughly, FPU trajectories behave like Toda), and ii) the `time to equilibrium'
(beyond which energy equipartition is reached). Below a specific energy
crossover, both times are found to scale exponentially as an inverse power of
the specific energy. However, this crossover goes to zero with increasing the
degrees of freedom $N$ as $\varepsilon _c \sim N^{-b}$, with $b \in [1.5,
2.5]$. For `generic data' initial conditions, instead, $J(t)$ allows to
quantify the continuous in time slow diffusion of the FPU trajectories in a
direction transverse to the Toda tori.

formulate the computation offloading problem as a social welfare optimization

the large merger rate of PBH binaries formed in the early universe. To put the
estimates of the latter on a firmer footing, we first derive analytical PBH
merger rate for general PBH mass functions while imposing a minimal initial
comoving distance between the binary and the PBH nearest to it, in order to
pick only initial configurations where the binary would not get disrupted. We
then study the formation and evolution of PBH binaries before recombination by
performing N-body simulations. We find that the analytical estimate based on
the tidally perturbed 2-body system strongly overestimates the present merger
rate when PBHs comprise all dark matter, as most initial binaries are disrupted
by the surrounding PBHs. This is mostly due to the formation of compact N-body
systems at matter-radiation equality. However, if PBHs make up a small fraction
of the dark matter, $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10\%$, these estimates become more
reliable. In that case, the merger rate observed by LIGO imposes the strongest
constraint on the PBH abundance in the mass range $2 - 160 M_\odot$. Finally,
we argue that, even if most initial PBH binaries are perturbed, the present
BH-BH merger rate of binaries formed in the early universe is larger than
$\mathcal{O}(10)\,{\rm Gpc}^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}\, f_{\rm PBH}^3$

of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystals via localized charges and identified
polarity-dependent degradation pathway by carrying out time-evolution
measurements for absorption spectra of perovskite films with underlying
different charge transport layers and ab initio molecular dynamics
calculations. It was found that the carrier polarity (hole-rich or
electron-rich) inside the perovskite films played a critical role in the
degradation rate, and polarity-dependent degradation pathway strongly depended
on the combination of surrounding gaseous molecules. The hole-rich perovskite
films degraded more rapidly in the existence of H2O than the electron-rich one,
while the degradation trend became opposite in only-oxygen ambient. Strikingly,
the hole-rich one was extremely weak to atmospheric air containing both H2O and
O2, whereas the MAPbI3 film with excessive electrons rather stabilized in air.
Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation was also done to find the
detailed degradation pathway of MAPbI3 under atmosphere for different polarity
of localized charge, which are in good agreement with experimental results.
Furthermore, X-ray assisted spectroscopic measurements confirmed the production
of Pb(OH)I as predicted from the simulation result.

annotators, and sufficient comparisons induce the success of classical
approaches. However, collecting a large number of labeled data is known as a
hard task, and most of the existing work pay little attention to the
generalization ability with insufficient samples. Meanwhile, recent progress in
large margin theory discloses that rather than just maximizing the minimum
margin, both the margin mean and variance, which characterize the margin
distribution, are more crucial to the overall generalization performance. To
address the issue of insufficient training samples, we propose a margin
distribution learning paradigm for ordinal embedding, entitled Distributional
Margin based Ordinal Embedding (\textit{DMOE}). Precisely, we first define the
margin for ordinal embedding problem. Secondly, we formulate a concise
objective function which avoids maximizing margin mean and minimizing margin
variance directly but exhibits the similar effect. Moreover, an Augmented
Lagrange Multiplier based algorithm is customized to seek the optimal solution
of \textit{DMOE} effectively. Experimental studies on both simulated and

inter-carrier/symbol interference (ISI/ICI) in orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM). Recent interests in low-latency applications have
motivated the usage of shorter OFDM symbols where one can either downscale the
CP at the cost of interference, or maintain it but with larger overhead.
Alternatively, this paper studies channel shortening methods exploiting the
properties of large multi-antenna precoding in order to steer the transmitted
signal energy toward channel paths inside an insufficient CP. It is shown that
ISI/ICI can asymptotically be canceled by conventional subcarrier-based
precoding with an infinite number of antennas. This is achieved by introducing
time-delay selectivity inside frequency-selective precoders in order to remove
undesired delayed signals, providing a trade-off between interference
mitigation and multi-path combining gains, and leading to subsequent gains in
high SNR. This frequency-domain precoding method, coined time-frequency (TF)
precoding, is compared to time-reversal (TR) filtering whose asymptotic rate is
optimal but introduces post-modulation processing with channel-dependent signal
distortion. In addition to maintain the legacy precoded multi-antenna OFDM
structure, finite-size analysis shows that TF-precoding converges faster to its
asymptotic rate than TR-filtering, so that TF-precoding can outperform
TRfiltering in the high-SNR regime with not-so-many antennas.

and finally a 3D decoder block to reconstruct the desired volume segmentation
masks from the latent feature space. The encoder and decoder blocks consist of
several 3D-convolutional layers that are densely connected among themselves so
that necessary feature aggregation can occur throughout the network. During
prediction, we apply selective thresholding followed by morphological
operation, on top of the network prediction, to better differentiate between
tumorous and non-tumorous image-slices, which shows more promise than only
thresholding-based approaches. We train and test our network on the

and amplitude. As expected, we see a presence of localized icosahedral ordering
in the disordered initial state (packing fraction around 0.62). As the
frequency is increased for both the shaking amplitudes (0.2 and 0.6 mm) studied
here, there is a rise in packing fraction, accompanied by an evolution to
crystallinity. The extent of crystallinity is found to depend on both the
amplitude and frequency of shaking. We find that the icosahedral ordering
remains localized and its extent does not grow significantly, while the
crystalline ordering grows rapidly as an ordering transition point is
approached. In the ordered state, crystalline clusters of both face centered
cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close packed (HCP) types are identified, the latter
of which grows from stacking faults. Our study shows that an earlier domination
of FCC gives way to HCP ordering at higher shaking frequencies, suggesting that
despite their coexistence, there is a subtle dynamical competition at play.
This competition depends on both shaking amplitude and frequency, as our
results as well as those of earlier theoretical simulations demonstrate. It is
likely that this involves the very small free energy difference between the two

respect to the external injections, (ii) energy transfer is leading and
helicity transfer is sub-leading and (iii) both are sub-leading and helicity is
maximal at all scales. As a result, the cases (ii-iii) give flows with
Kolmogorov-like inertial energy cascade and tuneable helicity
transfers/contents. We further explore regime (iii) by studying its effect on
the kinetics of point-like isotropic helicoids, particles whose dynamics is
isotropic but breaks parity invariance. We investigate small-scale fractal
clustering and preferential sampling of intense helical flow structures.
Depending on their structural parameters, the isotropic helicoids either
preferentially sample co-chiral or anti-chiral flow structures. We explain
these findings in limiting cases in terms of what is known for spherical
particles of different densities and degrees of inertia. Furthermore, we
present theoretical and numerical results for a stochastic model where
dynamical properties can be calculated using analytical perturbation theory.
Our study shows that a suitable tuning of the stirring mechanism can strongly

isotropic helicoids are the simplest particles able to preferentially sense

systems. These are observables whose expectation value yields a tight lower
bound to the average channel fidelity in question, thus constituting a
practical tool for certification of experimental CV gates. Our framework
applies to a broad class of target gates. Here, we focus on three specific
types of targets: multi-mode Gaussian unitary channels, single-mode coherent
state amplifiers, and the single-mode (non-Gaussian) cubic phase gate, which is
a crucial ingredient for CV universal quantum computation. Our witnesses are
experimentally-friendly as they rely exclusively on Gaussian measurements, even
for the non-Gaussian-target case. Moreover, in all three cases, they can be
measured efficiently in the estimation error $\epsilon$ and failure probability
$\Delta$, as well as in the number of modes $m$ for the Gaussian-target case.
To end up with, our approach for the Gaussian-target case relies on an improved
measurement scheme for Gaussian state-fidelity witnesses, which is polynomially
and exponentially more efficient in $m$ and $\Delta$, respectively, than
previous schemes. The latter constitutes an interesting byproduct result on its
own. Our findings are relevant to the experimental validation of many-body

reduction of system inertia, the focus of research expands towards short-term
grid dynamics and collective phenomena. Against this backdrop, Kuramoto-like
power grids have been established as a sound mathematical modeling framework
bridging between the simplified models from nonlinear dynamics and the more
detailed models used in electrical engineering. However, they have a blind spot
concerning grid components, which cannot be modeled by oscillator equations,
and hence do not allow to investigate storage-related issues from scratch. We
remove this shortcoming by bringing together Kuramoto-like and algebraic
load-flow equations. This is a substantial extension of the current Kuramoto
framework with arbitrary grid components. Based on this concept, we provide a
solid starting point for the integration of flexible storage units enabling to
address current problems like smart storage control, optimal siting and rough
cost estimations. For demonstration purpose, we here consider a wind power
application with realistic feed-in conditions. We show how to implement basic
control strategies from electrical engineering, give insights into their
potential with respect to frequency quality improvement and point out their

non-negative integer $d$ such that the following holds: there exists a
distribution $D$ of polynomials entirely supported on polynomials of degree at
most $d$ such that for all $z \in \{0,1\}^n$, we have $Pr_{P \sim D} [P(z) =

to $O{\log {{n}\choose{\leq \log 1/\epsilon}}}$, which is better for small

  In all known constructions of probabilistic polynomials for the OR function
(including the above improvement), the polynomials $P$ in the support of the

the variables $x_1,...,x_n$, i.e., the polynomial $1-P(x_1,...,x_n)$ is a
product of affine forms. We show that the $\epsilon$-error probabilistic degree

matching the above upper bound (up to poly-logarithmic factors).

addition to blocking the transmission, metallic layers have the feature of
blocking the reflection, too, they would make perfect absorbers. In this work,
we propose an experimental approach of using a single thin layer of Manganese
(Mn) as both the transmission suppresser and the reflection suppresser. This
approach leads to obtaining lithography-free ultra-broadband perfect absorption
in an ultra-wide spectrum ranging from Ultraviolet (UV) to Far Infrared (FIR).
The measured average absorption is approximately 99%. Such a promising result
can be achieved by only coating a single Mn layer on high-roughness substrates
that include random nano-pyramids on it. In other words, we do not need a stack
of different materials and combinations of geometrical features. The high
roughness is realized on a commercial Silicon wafer substrate by inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) etching. The key to this ultra-wideband absorption is
electromagnetic field tapering which exists due to the graded-index feature of
the structure (known as moth-eye effect), along with the ideal optical
properties of Mn which makes it an excellent metal for broadband absorption
applications. A full experimental characterization of the fabricated samples is
presented along with the physical analysis of the phenomena. The findings of
this paper can be used for the realization of lithography-free, cost-effective

detect this layer manually. This paper presents an automatic method of
choroidal segmentation from EDI-OCT images in neutrosophic space. In
neutrosophic approach for image processing, extracting any information from an
image and applying any process on it, is modeled by three sets including true,
false, and indeterminacy sets. At first, we transform each image to the
neutrosophic space; then, we calculate weights between each two nodes and apply
the Dijkstra algorithm in order to detect Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE)
layer. Based on RPE localization and applying gamma correction and homomorphic
filter to false set, we segment choroid layer by similar approach used for RPE.
The proposed algorithm is tested on 32 EDI OCT images of Heidelberg 3D OCT
Spectralis from 11 people and is compared with manual segmentation. The results
showed an unsigned error of 3.34 pixels (12.9 Micrometer) for macular images
and 6.55 pixels (25.3 Micrometer) for prepapillary images; which macular error
is lower than two other methods (7.71 pixels and 9.79 pixels). Furthermore, the
proposed method on prepapillary data is novel and published works are
concentrated on macular data. Identification of the boundary can help to
determine the loss or change of choroid, which can be used as features for
automatic determination of the retinal diseases.

galaxies make them interesting sources of high energy radiation. Depending upon
the level of turbulence present in their interstellar medium, the bulk of
cosmic rays produced inside starburst galaxies may lose most of their energy
before escaping, thereby making these sources behave as calorimeters, at least
up to some maximum energy. Contrary to previous studies, here we investigate in
detail the conditions under which cosmic ray confinement may be effective for
electrons and nuclei and we study the implications of cosmic ray confinement in
terms of multifrequency emission from starburst nuclei and production of high
energy neutrinos. The general predictions are then specialized to three cases
of active starbursts, namely M82, NGC253 and Arp220. Both primary and secondary
electrons, as well as electron-positron pairs produced by gamma ray absorption
inside starburst galaxies are taken into account. Electrons and positrons
produced as secondary products of hadronic interactions are found to be
responsible for most of the emission of leptonic origin. In particular,
synchrotron emission of very high energy secondary electrons produces an
extended emission of hard X-rays that represent a very interesting signature of
hadronic process in starburst galaxies, potentially accessible to current and
future observations in the X-ray band. A careful understanding of both the
production and absorption of gamma rays in starburst galaxies is instrumental
to the assessment of the role of these astrophysical sources as sources of high
energy astrophysical neutrinos.

minimize the biases in pulse time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements and their
uncertainties. Efforts to acquire more precise TOAs given fixed effective area
of telescopes, finite receiver noise, and limited integration time have led
pulsar astronomers to the solution of implementing ultra-wideband receivers.
This solution, however, has run up against the problem that pulse profile
shapes evolve with frequency, which raises the question of how to properly
measure and analyze TOAs obtained using template-matching methods. This paper
proposes a new method for one facet of this problem, that of template profile
generation, and demonstrates it on the well-timed millisecond pulsar
J1713+0747. Specifically, we decompose pulse profile evolution into a linear
combination of basis eigenvectors, the coefficients of which change slowly with
frequency such that their evolution is modeled simply by a sum of low degree
piecewise polynomial spline functions. These noise-free, high fidelity,
frequency-dependent templates can be used to make measurements of so-called
""wideband TOAs"" simultaneously with an estimate of the instantaneous dispersion
measure. The use of wideband TOAs is becoming important for pulsar timing array
experiments, as the volume of datasets comprised of conventional, subbanded
TOAs are quickly becoming unwieldly for the Bayesian analyses needed to uncover
latent gravitational wave signals. Although motivated by high precision timing
experiments, our technique is applicable in more general pulsar observations.

sculptures whose unfoldings cannot be sculpted. We investigate the
expressiveness of sculptures, as a proper subclass of HDA, by showing them to
be equivalent to regular ST-structures (an event-based counterpart of HDA) and
to (regular) Chu spaces over 3 (in their concurrent interpretation given by
Pratt). We believe that our results shed new light on the intuitions behind
sculpting as a method of modeling concurrent behavior, showing the precise

between the various proposed dynamo mechanisms believed to be the main cause of
starspot activity. For this research it is important to collect observation
time series that are long enough to unravel both long- and short-term spot
evolution. Doppler imaging is a very efficient method for studying spots of
stars that cannot be angularly resolved. Aims. High-resolution spectral
observations during 1994-2017 are analysed in order to reveal long- and
short-term changes in the spot activity of the FK Comae-type subgiant HD
199178. Methods. Most of the observations were collected with the Nordic
Optical Telescope. The Doppler imaging temperature maps were calculated using
an inversion technique based on Tikhonov regularisation and utilising multiple
spectral lines. Results. We present a unique series of 41 temperature maps
spanning more than 23 years. All reliable images show a large cool spot region
centred near the visible rotation pole. Some lower latitude cool features are
also recovered, although the reliability of these is questionable. There is an
expected anti-correlation between the mean surface temperature and the spot
coverage. Using the Doppler images, we construct the equivalent of a solar
butterfly diagram for HD 199178. Conclusions. HD 199178 clearly has a long-term
large and cool spot structure at the rotational pole. This spot structure
dominated the spot activity during the years 1994-2017. The size and position
of the structure has evolved with time, with a gradual increase during the last
years. The lack of lower latitude features prevents the determination of a
possible differential rotation.

regime of QCD directly for sufficiently heavy quarks, where combined strong
coupling and hopping expansions are convergent and a 3d effective theory can be
derived, which allows to control the sign problem either in simulations or by
fully analytic calculations. In this contribution we review the effective
theory and study the $N_c$-dependence of the nuclear liquid gas transition, as
well as the equation of state of baryonic matter in the strong coupling limit.
We find the transition to become more strongly first order with growing $N_c$,
suggesting that in the large $N_c$ limit its critical endpoint moves to high
temperatures to connect with the deconfinement transition. Furthermore, to
leading and next-to-leading order in the strong coupling and hopping
expansions, respectively, the pressure is found to scale as $p\sim N_c$. This
suggests that baryonic and quarkyonic matter might be the same at nuclear
densities. Further work is needed to see whether this result is stable under
gauge corrections.

address the problem of correlation clustering in the dynamic data stream model.
The stream consists of updates to the edge weights of a graph on $n$ nodes and
the goal is to find a node-partition such that the end-points of
negative-weight edges are typically in different clusters whereas the
end-points of positive-weight edges are typically in the same cluster. We
present polynomial-time, $O(n\cdot \ \mbox{polylog}~n)$-space approximation
algorithms for natural problems that arise.
  We first develop data structures based on linear sketches that allow the
""quality"" of a given node-partition to be measured. We then combine these data
structures with convex programming and sampling techniques to solve the
relevant approximation problem. Unfortunately, the standard LP and SDP
formulations are not obviously solvable in $O(n\cdot \mbox{polylog}~n)$-space.
Our work presents space-efficient algorithms for the convex programming
required, as well as approaches to reduce the adaptivity of the sampling.

  In this general context, using a realization of Lebed and Vendramin of
$M(X,r)$ as a regular submonoid in the semidirect product
$A(X,r)\rtimes\mathrm{Sym}(X)$, where $A(X,r)$ is the structure monoid of the

finite normal extension of a commutative affine subalgebra. In particular,
$K[M(X,r)]$ is a Noetherian PI-algebra of finite Gelfand--Kirillov dimension
bounded by $|X|$. We also characterize, in ring-theoretical terms of
$K[M(X,r)]$, when $(X,r)$ is an involutive solution. This characterization
provides, in particular, a positive answer to the Gateva-Ivanova conjecture

can leverage the enormous real-time data generated by billions of mobile
devices to train AI models, which enable intelligent mobile applications. In
this emerging research area, one key direction is to efficiently utilize radio
resources for wireless data acquisition to minimize the latency of executing a
learning task at an edge server. Along this direction, we consider the specific
problem of retransmission decision in each communication round to ensure both
reliability and quantity of those training data for accelerating model
convergence. To solve the problem, a new retransmission protocol called
data-importance aware automatic-repeat-request (importance ARQ) is proposed.
Unlike the classic ARQ focusing merely on reliability, importance ARQ
selectively retransmits a data sample based on its uncertainty which helps
learning and can be measured using the model under training. Underpinning the
proposed protocol is a derived elegant communication-learning relation between
two corresponding metrics, i.e., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and data
uncertainty. This relation facilitates the design of a simple threshold based
policy for importance ARQ. The policy is first derived based on the classic
classifier model of support vector machine (SVM), where the uncertainty of a
data sample is measured by its distance to the decision boundary. The policy is
then extended to the more complex model of convolutional neural networks (CNN)
where data uncertainty is measured by entropy. Extensive experiments have been
conducted for both the SVM and CNN using real datasets with balanced and
imbalanced distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that importance ARQ
effectively copes with channel fading and noise in wireless data acquisition to
achieve faster model convergence than the conventional channel-aware ARQ.

challenging tasks. However, most successful DNNs have an extremely complex
structure, leading to extensive research on model compression.As a significant
area of progress in model compression, traditional gradual pruning approaches
involve an iterative prune-retrain procedure and may suffer from two critical
issues: local importance judgment, where the pruned weights are merely
unimportant in the current model; and an irretrievable pruning process, where
the pruned weights have no chance to come back. Addressing these two issues,
this paper proposes the Drop Pruning approach, which leverages stochastic
optimization in the pruning process by introducing a drop strategy at each
pruning step, namely, drop away, which stochastically deletes some unimportant
weights, and drop back, which stochastically recovers some pruned weights. The
suitable choice of drop probabilities decreases the model size during the
pruning process and helps it flow to the target sparsity. Compared to the
Bayesian approaches that stochastically train a compact model for pruning, we
directly aim at stochastic gradual pruning. We provide a detailed analysis
showing that the drop away and drop back approaches have individual
contributions. Moreover, Drop Pruning can achieve competitive compression
performance and accuracy on many benchmark tasks compared with state-of-the-art
weights pruning and Bayesian training approaches.

classical result of Tutte(1954) is the polynomial time algorithm to check
whether a given graph has a specified f-factor. However, checking for the
presence of a connected f-factor is easily seen to generalize HAMILTONIAN CYCLE

NP-complete even when we restrict f(v) to be at least n^e for each vertex v and
0<e<1; on the other side of the spectrum of nontrivial lower bounds on f, the

related to slight reductions of both the CDW order parameter and $T_c$. Our DFT
calculations further predict a semimetal-to-semiconductor transition of the

coincides with a melted CDW state in TiSeS as measured with STM. Finally, we
rationalize the $x$-dependence of the $e$-$h$ band overlap in terms of

predicts the formation of a single massive object due to the direct collapse of
a massive gas cloud. Simulations over the last years have however shown that
such a scenario is very difficult to achieve. A realistic model of black hole

  Local Differential Privacy via Incorporating Prior Knowledge","Accepted by INFOCOM'19",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating frequencies of certain items among a population is a basic step in
data analytics, which enables more advanced data analytics (e.g., heavy hitter
identification, frequent pattern mining), client software optimization, and
detecting unwanted or malicious hijacking of user settings in browsers.
Frequency estimation and heavy hitter identification with local differential
privacy (LDP) protect user privacy as well as the data collector. Existing LDP
algorithms cannot leverage 1) prior knowledge about the noise in the estimated
item frequencies and 2) prior knowledge about the true item frequencies. As a
result, they achieve suboptimal performance in practice.
  In this work, we aim to design LDP algorithms that can leverage such prior
knowledge. Specifically, we design ${Calibrate}$ to incorporate the prior
knowledge via statistical inference. ${Calibrate}$ can be appended to an
existing LDP algorithm to reduce its estimation errors. We model the prior
knowledge about the noise and the true item frequencies as two probability
distributions, respectively. Given the two probability distributions and an
estimated frequency of an item produced by an existing LDP algorithm, our
${Calibrate}$ computes the conditional probability distribution of the item's
frequency and uses the mean of the conditional probability distribution as the
calibrated frequency for the item. It is challenging to estimate the two
probability distributions due to data sparsity. We address the challenge via
integrating techniques from statistics and machine learning. Our empirical
results on two real-world datasets show that ${Calibrate}$ significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art LDP algorithms for frequency estimation and heavy
hitter identification.

then determined from the one-photon exchange contribution to the $\Delta$

mainly used for possibly nonintegrable $L^\infty$ solutions $u$, the natural
spaces behind this duality are $L^\infty$ for $S_t$ and $L^1$ for $G_t$. We
therefore develop a corresponding $L^1$ theory for viscosity solutions
$\varphi$. But $L^1$ itself is too large for well-posedness, and we rigorously
identify the weakest $L^1$ type Banach setting where we can have it -- a
subspace of $L^1$ called $L^\infty_{\rm int}$. A consequence of our results is
a new and optimal domain of dependence estimate for second order anisotropic

decline of Q-factor and an increase in the resonance intensity. Therefore, in
order to determine the optimal design for applications in THz sensing, a Figure
of Merit (FoM) is required. Previous studies have identified the asymmetry
regimes at which the peak FoM occurs for various, specific unit cell
geometries. However to date, there is no systematic comparison of the resulting
FoMs for common and novel geometries. Here, a THz planar metafilm featuring
split ring resonators with four distributed capacitive gaps is investigated to
compare three unique methods of implementing asymmetry: (1) adjacent L-bracket
translation, (2) capacitive gap translation and (3) increasing gap width. The
results obtained find that by translating two gaps and increasing the bottom
gap width of the unit cell, the high-Q Fano-like resonances are $6 \times$
higher than the FoM for the fundamental dipole mode. This work further informs

that by tuning the voltage applied on the gates, the injected spin-unpolarized

The spin freedom of the outputs can be controlled by simply tuning voltage on

Recursive-DBSCAN - an algorithm that recursively applies DBSCAN until clusters
below the preset maximum number of nodes are obtained. That approach leads to
61% decrease in runtimes of the CVRPTW solver as benchmarked against Google
Optimization Tools, while the difference of total distance and number of
vehicles used by found solutions is below 7%. The improvement of runtimes with
the Recursive-DBSCAN method is because of splitting the node-set into
constituent clusters, which limits the number of solutions checked by the
solver, consequently reducing the runtime. The proposed method consumes less
memory and is able to find solutions for problems up to 5000 nodes, while the
baseline Google Optimisation Tools solves problems up to 2000 nodes.

interesting techniques have been proposed to improve seq2seq models, making
them capable of handling different challenges, such as saliency, fluency and
human readability, and generate high-quality summaries. Generally speaking,
most of these techniques differ in one of these three categories: network
structure, parameter inference, and decoding/generation. There are also other
concerns, such as efficiency and parallelism for training a model. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive literature survey on different seq2seq models
for abstractive text summarization from the viewpoint of network structures,
training strategies, and summary generation algorithms. Several models were
first proposed for language modeling and generation tasks, such as machine
translation, and later applied to abstractive text summarization. Hence, we
also provide a brief review of these models. As part of this survey, we also
develop an open source library, namely, Neural Abstractive Text Summarizer
(NATS) toolkit, for the abstractive text summarization. An extensive set of
experiments have been conducted on the widely used CNN/Daily Mail dataset to
examine the effectiveness of several different neural network components.
Finally, we benchmark two models implemented in NATS on the two recently
released datasets, namely, Newsroom and Bytecup.

promising applications in acoustic beam steering, focusing, impedance matching,

acoustic metamaterials can be enhanced by controlling an additional parameter
known as Willis coupling, which is analogous to bianisotropy in electromagnetic
metamaterials. The magnitude of Willis coupling in an acoustic meta-atom has
been shown theoretically to have an upper limit, however the feasibility of
reaching this limit has not been experimentally investigated. Here we introduce
a meta-atom with Willis coupling which closely approaches this theoretical
limit, that is much simpler and less prone to thermo-viscous losses than
previously reported structures. We perform two-dimensional experiments to
measure the strong Willis coupling, supported by numerical calculations. Our
meta-atom geometry is readily modeled analytically, enabling the strength of
Willis coupling and its peak frequency to be easily controlled. Together with
its ease of fabrication, this will facilitate the design of future high

  Communications","This paper is accepted for publication in the IEEE Global
  Communications Conference 2018 (GLOBECOM'18)",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a dynamic spectrum sensing-based architecture to
provide connectivity for a massive number of Internet-of-things (IoT) objects
over the unlicensed spectrum. Specifically, the architecture relies on
deploying sensing access points (SAPs), e.g., small cells with sensing
capabilities, that aim to (i) identify a large number of narrowband channels in
a wideband spectrum, as many massive IoT applications have low-rate
requirements, and (ii) aggressively reuse the unlicensed channels at the SAPs'
locations as IoT devices typically transmit at low power, occupying a small
spatial footprint. Instead of enforcing each SAP to sense the entire spectrum,
we develop a sensing assignment scheduler that ensures each one senses a subset
of the spectrum. We then develop a distributed spatio-spectral cooperative
sensing algorithm that enables each SAP to have local information about the
occupancy of the entire spectrum. We present numerical simulations to validate
the effectiveness of the proposed system in the presence of WiFi access points
(APs). It is shown that the proposed system outperforms non-cooperative and
centralized schemes in terms of reliably identifying more available
spatio-spectral blocks with a lower misdetection of transmitting WiFi APs.

(QPL) in the exam which jeopardizes the quality of education. Therefore, it is
high time to think about a more secure and flexible question sharing system
which can prevent QPL issue in the future education system. Blockchain enables
a way of creating and storing transactions, contracts or anything that requires
protection against tampering, accessing etc. This paper presents a new scheme
for smart education, by utilizing the concept of blockchain, for question
sharing. A two-phase encryption technique for encrypting question paper (QSP)
is proposed. In the first phase, QSPs are encrypted using timestamp and in the
second phase, previous encrypted QSPs are encrypted again using a timestamp,
salt hash and hashes from previous QSPs. These encrypted QSPs are stored in the
blockchain along with a smart contract which helps the user to unlock the
selected QSP. An algorithm is also proposed for selecting a QSP for the exam
which picks a QSP randomly. Moreover, a timestamp based lock is imposed on the
scheme so that no one can decrypt the QSP before the allowed time. Finally,
security is analyzed by proving different propositions and the superiority of
the proposed scheme over existing schemes is proven through a comparative study
based on the different features.

  arXiv:1601.01325",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The multiplicative coalescent is a mean-field Markov process in which any
pair of blocks coalesces at rate proportional to the product of their masses.
In Aldous and Limic (1998) each extreme eternal version of the multiplicative
coalescent was described in three different ways, one of which matched its
(marginal) law to that of the ordered excursion lengths above past minima of a
certain L\'evy-type process. Using a modification of the breadth-first-walk
construction from Aldous (1997) and Aldous and Limic (1998), and some new
insight from the thesis by Uribe (2007), this work settles an open problem (3)
from Aldous (1997) in the more general context of Aldous and Limic (1998).
Informally speaking, each eternal version is entirely encoded by its
L\'evy-type process, and contrary to Aldous' original intuition, the time for
the multiplicative coalescent does correspond to the linear increase in the
constant part of the drift of the L\'e}y-type process. In the ""standard
multiplicative coalescent"" context of Aldous (1997), this result was first
announced by Armend\'ariz in 2001, while its first published proof is due to
Broutin and Marckert (2016), who simultaneously account for the process of
excess (or surplus) edge counts.

""using neural networks to feed neural networks"", this engineering work focuses
on the use of practical, robust, scalable and easy-to-implement data

Some existing ones have been tested for comparison purposes such as noise
injection or the use of regular expressions. Others are modified or improved
techniques like lexical replacement. Finally more innovative ones, such as the
generation of paraphrases using back-translation or by the transformation of
syntactic trees, are based on robust, scalable, and easy-to-use NLP Cloud APIs.

induces the deposition of porous or amorphous-like W-O structures,

50 keV incident He+ ion beams with a total fluence of 5 x 1017 ion/cm^2,
significant amounts of He were identified in porous coatings by Rutherford

measurements showed that most of the implanted He was already released from the
porous coatings five month after implantation while for the case of amorphous
