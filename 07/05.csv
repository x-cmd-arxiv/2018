Navier-Stokes turbulence at a Taylor-scale Reynolds number of $650$ is studied
using direct numerical simulations on a $4096^3$ grid; the Schmidt number is
unity. By measuring scalar increment moments of high orders, while ensuring
statistical convergence, we provide unambiguous evidence that the scaling
exponents saturate to $1.2$ for moment order beyond about $12$, indicating that
scalar intermittency is dominated by the most singular shock-like cliffs in the
scalar field. We show that the fractal dimension of the spatial support of
steep cliffs is about $1.8$, whose sum with the saturation exponent value of
$1.2$ adds up to the space dimension of $3$, thus demonstrating a deep
connection between the geometry and statistics in turbulent scalar mixing. The
anomaly for the fourth and sixth order moments is comparable to that in the
Kraichnan model for the roughness exponent of $2/3$.

distinct electrical resistivity phases and has attracted a lot of attention for
interesting device applications. However, such resistivity switching effects
are often weak, and cannot be modulated by an external gate voltage - limiting
their widespread usage. Using a back-gated 1T-TaS2/2H-MoS2 heterojunction, here
we show that the usual resistivity switching in TaS2 due to different phase
transitions is accompanied with a surprisingly strong modulation in the
Schottky barrier height (SBH) at the TaS2/MoS2 interface - providing an
additional knob to control the degree of the phase-transition-driven
resistivity switching by an external gate voltage. In particular, the
commensurate (C) to triclinic (T) phase transition results in an increase in
the SBH owing to a collapse of the Mott gap in TaS2. The change in SBH allows
us to estimate an electrical Mott gap opening of ~71 +/- 7 meV in the C phase
of TaS2. On the other hand, the nearly-commensurate (NC) to incommensurate (IC)
phase transition results in a suppression in the SBH, and the heterojunction
shows a gate-controlled resistivity switching up to 17.3, which is ~14.5 times
higher than that of standalone TaS2. The findings mark an important step
forward showing a promising pathway to externally control as well as amplify
the CDW induced resistivity switching. This will boost device applications that
exploit these phase transitions, such as ultra-broadband photodetection,
negative differential conductance, fast oscillator and threshold switching in
neuromorphic circuits.

effectively acts as a regularizer for the task at hand, by minimizing the
differential entropy of the distribution spanned by latent vectors. In addition
to providing a very general formulation, extensive experiments of our model on

removing potential tunability via electronic gating or distance-dependent

single-atom magnetic information storage based on bistability in the orbital
population, or so-called valency, of an individual Co atom on semiconducting
black phosphorus (BP). Distance-dependent screening from the BP surface
stabilizes the two distinct valencies and enables us to electronically
manipulate the relative orbital population, total magnetic moment and spatial
charge density of an individual magnetic atom without a spin-dependent readout
mechanism. Furthermore, we show that the strongly anisotropic wavefunction can
be used to locally tailor the switching dynamics between the two valencies.
This orbital memory derives stability from the energetic barrier to atomic
relaxation and demonstrates the potential for high-temperature single-atom

control of distribution networks. Widely used algorithms such as Gauss-Netwon
perform poorly with the limited number of measurements typically available for
DSSE, often require many iterations to obtain reasonable results, and sometimes
fail to converge. DSSE is a non-convex problem, and working with a limited
number of measurements further aggravate the situation, as indeterminacy
induces multiple global (in addition to local) minima. Gauss-Newton is also
known to be sensitive to initialization. Hence, the situation is far from

Gauss-Newton that will avoid these DSSE-specific pitfalls. This paper proposes
using historical or simulation-derived data to train a shallow neural network

control parameter $\lambda$ is varied across a quantum phase transition. For
this purpose we consider a finite-size scaling (FSS) framework. Our working
hypothesis is based on a scaling assumption of the fidelity in terms of the FSS
variables associated to $\lambda$ and to its variation $\delta \lambda$. This
framework entails the FSS predictions for continuous transitions, and meanwhile
enables to extend them to first-order transitions, where the FSS becomes
qualitatively different. The latter is supported by analytical and numerical
analyses of the quantum Ising chain along its first-order quantum transition
line, driven by an external longitudinal field.

STEVE ensures that the model is only utilized when doing so does not introduce

in sample efficiency, and in contrast to previous model-based approaches,

potential, has been developed. In this work, we explore this potential,
applying it to the case study of a single wall carbon nanotube. We performed a
series of molecular dynamics simulations of longitudinal tension and
compression on armchair carbon nanotubes, comparing two full atomistic models,
described by means Tersoff and AIREBO potentials, and the coarse grained model
described by means of TersoffCG. We followed each stage and mode of
deformation, finding a good matching between the stress strain curves under
tension independently from the used potential, with a small difference in the
pre-fracture zone. Conversely, under compression the coarse grain model
presents a buckling stress almost the double of the full atomistic models, and
a more than double post-buckling stress. With the increase of the nanotube
diameter, the capturing of the buckling modes is enhanced, however the stress
overestimation remains. A decreasing of the three body angular term in the
potential can be a rough way to recover the buckling stress, with small losses
in the capturing of the post-buckling behavior. In spite of a good agreement
under compression, the fracture behavior of the nanotube is strongly
influenced, suggesting this modification only when no fractures are present.
The findings reported in this work underlie the necessity of accurately
evaluate the use of a coarse grain model when compressive loads are applied to
the system during the simulation.

that the collection of percolation cycles converges to the conformal loop

light-matter interaction under the situation where one control field carries an
optical vortex, and another control field has no vortex. We show that the
orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the vortex control beam can be transferred to
a generated probe field through a four-wave mixing (FWM) process and without
switching on and off of the control fields. Such a mechanism of OAM transfer is
much simpler than in a double-tripod scheme in which the exchange of vortices
is possible only when two control fields carry optical vortices of opposite
helicity. The losses appearing during such OAM exchange are then calculated. It
is found that the one-photon detuning plays an important role in minimizing the
losses. An approximate analytical expression is obtained for the optimal
one-photon detuning for which the losses are minimum while the intensity of
generated probe field is maximum. The influence of phase mismatch on the
exchange of optical vortices is also investigated. We show that in presence of
phase mismatch the exchange of optical vortices can still be efficient.

profiles. Using nominal assumptions about the weak-lensing and x-ray mass
profiles, we find that the EG predictions (based on no dark matter) are
acceptable fits only near the virial radius. In the cores and in the outskirts,
the mass profile shape differences allow us to confirm previous results that
the EG model can be ruled out at $>5\sigma$. However, when we account for
systematic uncertainties in the observed weak-lensing and x-ray profiles, we
find good agreement for the EG predictions. For instance, if the weak-lensing
total mass profiles are shallow in the core and the x-ray gas density profiles
are steep in the outskirts, EG can predict the observed dark matter profile in
$0.3 \le r \le 1$R$_{200}$, where R$_{200}$ is the radius which encloses
200$\times$ the critical density of the Universe. The required x-ray and
lensing shapes are within the current observational systematics-limited errors
on cluster profiles. We also show that EG itself allows flexibility in its
predictions, which can allow for good agreement between the observations and
the predictions. We conclude that we cannot formally rule our EG as an
alternative to dark matter on the cluster scale and that we require better
constraints on the weak-lensing and gas mass profile shapes in the region $0.3

in precipitable water vapor cause fluctuations in atmospheric brightness
emission, which are assumed to be proportional to phase fluctuations of the
astronomical signal seen by an antenna. Water vapor radiometry consists of
using a radiometer to measure variations in the atmospheric brightness emission
to correct for the phase fluctuations. The CWVR channel isolation requirement
of < -20 dB is met, indicating < 1% power leakage between any two channels.
Gain stability tests indicate that Channel 1 needs repair, and that the
fluctuations in output counts for Channel 2 to 5 are negatively correlated to
the CWVR enclosure ambient temperature, with a change of ~ 405 counts per 1
degree C change in temperature. With temperature correction, the single channel

stability is < 2.5 x 10^-4 over t = 2.5 - 10^3 sec, all of which meet the

existence of two dynamical regimes with increasing packing fraction is found,
it is characterized by a crossover of the structural relaxation time at a

Arrhenius behaviour. This transition is also accompanied by a minimum of the
$\beta$ exponent in correspondence of $C_w^*$ and by the existence of different
diffusive regimes. A theoretical prediction to describe the experimental data
is provided: at very low concentration the dynamics is well described by a
Fickian diffusion, at intermediate concentrations an effective non Fickian
anomalous diffusion has to be considered, while at the highest investigated
concentrations the emergence of a ballistic motion is well described within the
Mode Coupling Theory. Moreover the fragility of IPN microgels can be tuned by
varying the particle softness thanks to the mutual PNIPAM-PAAc network
composition: stiffer particles provide more fragile behaviours.

a record-breaking gradient computation cost of $\mathcal{O}\left( \min( n^{1/2}

  Detection","to appear in ECCV 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Average precision (AP), the area under the recall-precision (RP) curve, is
the standard performance measure for object detection. Despite its wide
acceptance, it has a number of shortcomings, the most important of which are
(i) the inability to distinguish very different RP curves, and (ii) the lack of
directly measuring bounding box localization accuracy. In this paper, we
propose 'Localization Recall Precision (LRP) Error', a new metric which we
specifically designed for object detection. LRP Error is composed of three
components related to localization, false negative (FN) rate and false positive
(FP) rate. Based on LRP, we introduce the 'Optimal LRP', the minimum achievable
LRP error representing the best achievable configuration of the detector in
terms of recall-precision and the tightness of the boxes. In contrast to AP,
which considers precisions over the entire recall domain, Optimal LRP
determines the 'best' confidence score threshold for a class, which balances
the trade-off between localization and recall-precision. In our experiments, we
show that, for state-of-the-art object (SOTA) detectors, Optimal LRP provides
richer and more discriminative information than AP. We also demonstrate that
the best confidence score thresholds vary significantly among classes and
detectors. Moreover, we present LRP results of a simple online video object
detector which uses a SOTA still image object detector and show that the
class-specific optimized thresholds increase the accuracy against the common
approach of using a general threshold for all classes. At
https://github.com/cancam/LRP we provide the source code that can compute LRP
for the PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO datasets. Our source code can easily be adapted
to other datasets as well.

decade, since the introduction of effective field theories (EFTs) into
post-Newtonian (PN) gravity. These have been put forward in the context of
gravitational waves (GWs) from the compact binary inspiral. The mature
development of this interdisciplinary field has resulted in significant
advances of wide interest to physics at several levels serving various
purposes. The field has firmly demonstrated, that seemingly disparate physical
domains, such as quantum field theory and classical gravity, are related, and
that the EFT framework is a universal one, where it has been proven to supply a
robust methodology to boost progress in the development of PN theory. The
review is aimed at a broad audience, from general readers new to the field, to
specialists and experts in related subjects.
  The review begins with an overview of the introduction of EFTs into classical
gravity and their development. Then, the basic ideas, which form the conceptual
foundation of EFTs, are provided, and the strategy of a multi-stage EFT
framework, which is utilized for the PN binary inspiral problem, is outlined.
The main body of the review is then dedicated to presenting in detail the study
of each of the effective theories at each of the intermediate scales in the
problem, up to the actual GW observables. The review is concluded with the
multiple prospects of building on the progress in the field, and using further
modern field theory insights and tools, to specifically address the study of
GWs, as well as to broadly expand our fundamental understanding of gauge and
gravity theories across the classical and quantum regimes.

boundary trace anomaly can depend on marginal directions in the presence of
supersymmetry. Recently, it was found that a graphene-like non-supersymmetric
conformal field theory with a four-dimensional bulk photon and a
three-dimensional boundary electron has two boundary central charges that
depend on an exactly marginal direction, namely the gauge coupling. In this
work, we supersymmetrize this theory, paying special attention to the boundary
terms required by supersymmetry. We study models with 4, 8, and 16 Poincar\'e
supercharges in the bulk, half of which are broken by the boundary. In all
cases, we find that at all orders in perturbation theory, the gauge coupling is
not renormalized, providing strong evidence that these theories are boundary
conformal field theories. Moreover, the boundary central charges depend on the
coupling. One possible exception to this dependence on marginal directions is
that the difference between the two charges is coupling independent at one-loop
in the maximally supersymmetric case. In our analysis, a possible boundary
Chern-Simons term is incorporated by a bulk $\theta$-term.

driven close to its plasmon resonance may enable Berryogenesis: the spontaneous
generation of a self-induced Bloch band Berry flux. The self-induced Berry flux
supports and is sustained by a circulating plasmonic motion, which may arise
even for a linearly polarized driving field. This non-equilibrium phase
transition occurs above a critical driving amplitude, and may be of either
continuous or discontinuous type. Berryogenesis relies on feedback due to
interband coherences induced by internal fields, and may readily occur in a
wide variety of multiband systems. We anticipate that graphene devices, in
particular, provide a natural platform to achieve Berryogenesis and

obtained from the SM ones by flipping the chirality, we count 13 BSM four-quark
operators of a given chirality linearly independent of each other and of the
aforesaid 14 operators for which hadronic matrix elements are already known. We
present results in two bases for all these operators, one termed DQCD basis
useful for the calculation of the hadronic matrix elements in the DQCD approach

group evolution above the 1~GeV scale. We demonstrate that the pattern of long

magnetic flux variations that thread the system of interest without penetrating

paradigm for topological pumping induced, instead, by magnetic flux variations
$\delta\chi$ inserted through the bulk of topological phases. We show that
$\delta\chi$ generically controls the analog of a topological pump, accompanied
by robust physical phenomena. We demonstrate this concept of bulk pumping in
two paradigmatic types of 2D topological phases: integer and fractional quantum
Hall systems and topological superconductors. We show, in particular, that bulk

large numbers of stars, with the ultimate goal of reconstructing the formation
history of the Milky Way using abundances as tracers. However, interpretation
of these data requires that we understand the relationship between stellar
distributions in chemical and physical space, i.e., how similar in chemical
abundance do we expect a pair of stars to be as a function of the distance
between their formation sites. We investigate this question by simulating the
gravitational collapse of a turbulent molecular cloud extracted from a
galaxy-scale simulation, seeded with chemical inhomogeneities with different
initial spatial scales. We follow the collapse from galactic scales down to
resolutions scales of $\approx 10^{-3}$ pc, and find that, during this process,
turbulence mixes the metal patterns, reducing the abundance scatter initially
present in the gas by an amount that depends on the initial scale of
inhomogeneity of each metal field. However, we find that regardless of the
initial spatial structure of the metals at the onset of collapse, the final
stellar abundances are highly correlated on distances below a few pc, and
nearly uncorrelated on larger distances. Consequently, the star formation
process defines a natural size scale of $\sim 1$ pc for chemically-homogenous
star clusters, suggesting that any clusters identified as homogenous in
chemical space must have formed within $\sim 1$ pc of one another. However, in
order to distinguish different star clusters in chemical space, observations
across multiple elements will be required, and the elements that are likely to
be most efficient at separating distinct clusters in chemical space are those
whose correlation length in the ISM is of order tens of pc, comparable to the
sizes of individual molecular clouds.

switches between two modes, with a typical time between mode changes of only
$1.7$ s (or $\sim\!1000$ rotations), the shortest observed so far. The two
modes differ in both intensity and polarization, with relatively large
differences in the interpulse and much more modest ones in the main pulse. We

$\sim\!25$ ms, placing an empirical constraint on the timescale over which mode
changes occurs. We also find that the properties of the giant pulses emitted by
PSR B1957+20 are correlated with the mode of the regular emission: their rate

of SiS, in collisions with atomic O, and of its formation, through the reaction
between Si and SO. We find that both reactions are rapid, with rate
coefficients of a few times 10$^{-10}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, almost independent of
temperature.
  In the reaction between Si and SO, SiO production is 5-7 times more efficient
than SiS formation.
  The reaction of SiS with O atoms can play an important role in destroying SiS
in envelopes around evolved stars. We built a simple chemical model of a
postshock gas to study the chemistry of SiS in protostellar outflows and we
found that SiS forms with a lower abundance and later than SiO, that SiS is
efficiently destroyed through reaction with O, and that the main SiS-forming
reactions are Si + SO and Si + SO$_2$.

threefold. First, we want to explore the AGN-nature of nearby type-1 LINERs.
Second, we aim at deriving a reliable interpretation for the different

mechanism. Third, we intend to probe the neutral gas in the nuclei of these

on the basis of optical ground- and space-based long-slit spectroscopic
observations taken with TWIN/CAHA and ALFOSC/NOT. Kinematics and fluxes of a
set of emission lines, from H{\beta} to [S II], and the NaD doublet in
absorption have been modelled and measured, after the subtraction of the
underlying starlight. We also use ancillary spectroscopic data from HST/STIS.
We found that the broad H{\alpha} component is sometimes elusive in our
ground-based spectroscopy whereas it is ubiquitous for space-based data. By
combining optical diagnostic diagrams, theoretical models (for AGNs, pAGB-stars
and shocks) and the weak/strong-[O I] classification, we exclude the
pAGBs-stars scenario in favor of the AGN as the dominant mechanism of
ionisation in these LINERs, being shocks however relevant. The kinematical
properties of the emission lines may indicate the presence of ionized outflows,
preferentially seen in [O I]. However, the neutral gas outflows, diagnosed by
NaD, would appear to be less frequent.

from the X-ATLAS and XMM-XXL North fields and compile the largest X-ray sample
up to date, to investigate how X-ray AGN affect the star-formation of their
host galaxies in a wide redz and luminosity baseline, i.e., 0.03<z<3 and log LX
(2-10 keV)= (41-45.5) ergs-1. Our sample consists of 3336 AGN. 1872 X-ray
objects have spectroscopic redz. For the remaining sources we calculate
photometric redz using TPZ, a machine-learning algorithm. We estimate stellar
masses (M*) and Star Formation Rates (SFRs) by applying SED fitting through the
CIGALE code, using optical, near-IR and mid-IR photometry. 608 of our sources
also have far-IR photometry (Herschel). We use these sources to calibrate the
SFR calculations of the rest of our X-ray sample. Our results show a
correlation between the LX and the SFR, at all redz and LX spanned by our
sample. We also find a dependence of the specific SFR (sSFR) on redz, while
there are indications that LX enhances the sSFR even at low redz. We then
disentangle the effects of M* and redz on the SFR and study again its
dependence on the LX. Towards this end, we use the Schreiber et al. formula to
estimate the SFR of main sequence galaxies that have the same stellar mass and
redshift as our X-ray AGN. Our analysis reveals that the AGN enhances the
star-formation of its host galaxy, when the galaxy lies below the main sequence
and quenches the star-formation of the galaxy it lives in, when the host lies
above the main sequence. Therefore, the effect of AGN on the SFR of the host
galaxy, depends on the location of the galaxy relative to the main sequence.

General Relativity, which has so far withstood a multitude of empirical tests

tenacious challenges of modern cosmology and of particle physics have motivated
the exploration of further generalised theories of spacetime. Even though
Einstein's interpretation of gravity in terms of the curvature of spacetime is
commonly adopted, the assignment of geometrical concepts to gravity is
ambiguous because General Relativity allows three entirely different, but
equivalent approaches of which Einstein's interpretation is only one. From a
field-theoretical perspective, however, the construction of a consistent theory
for a Lorentz-invariant massless spin-2 particle uniquely leads to General
Relativity. Keeping Lorentz invariance then implies that any modification of
General Relativity will inevitably introduce additional propagating degrees of
freedom into the gravity sector. Adopting this perspective, we will review the
recent progress in constructing consistent field theories of gravity based on
additional scalar, vector and tensor fields. Within this conceptual framework,
we will discuss theories with Galileons, with Lagrange densities as constructed
by Horndeski and beyond, extended to DHOST interactions, or containing
generalized Proca fields and extensions thereof, or several Proca fields, as

location and shape of each lane. It severs as one of the key techniques to

features makes lane detection algorithms tend to be confused by other objects
with similar local appearance. Moreover, the inconsistent number of lanes on a
road as well as diverse lane line patterns, e.g. solid, broken, single, double,
merging, and splitting lines further hamper the performance. In this paper, we
propose a deep neural network based method, named LaneNet, to break down the
lane detection into two stages: lane edge proposal and lane line localization.
Stage one uses a lane edge proposal network for pixel-wise lane edge
classification, and the lane line localization network in stage two then
detects lane lines based on lane edge proposals. Please note that the goal of
our LaneNet is built to detect lane line only, which introduces more
difficulties on suppressing the false detections on the similar lane marks on
the road like arrows and characters. Despite all the difficulties, our lane
detection is shown to be robust to both highway and urban road scenarios method
without relying on any assumptions on the lane number or the lane line
patterns. The high running speed and low computational cost endow our LaneNet
the capability of being deployed on vehicle-based systems. Experiments validate
that our LaneNet consistently delivers outstanding performances on real world

that some of these correlations can be interpreted from basic physical
constraints imposed on a simple Taylor expansion of the binding energy around
saturation density. In particular, we investigate the correlations among the
following empirical parameters: the symmetry energy $E_{sym}$, the slope and
curvature of the symmetry energy $L_{sym}$ and $K_{sym}$, and the curvature and
skewness of the binding energy in symmetric matter $K_{sat}$ and $Q_{sat}$. The
uncertainties on these correlations is estimated through analytical modelling
as well as a meta-modelling analysis of the EoS subject to physical
constraints. We show that a huge dispersion of the correlations among low order
empirical parameters is induced by the unknown higher order empirical
parameters, such as $K_{sym}$ (second order) and $Q_{sat}$ and $Q_{sym}$ (third
order). We also propose an explanation of the reason why $Q_{sat}$ is weakly
constrained by present experimental data. We conclude that selective
observables on high order parameters, such as $K_{sym}$ and $Q_{sat}$, should
be better determined before the present uncertainties on the EoS can be further
reduced.

learn to efficiently reuse knowledge between different tasks. Recently the
Successor Representation was shown to have empirical benefits for transferring
knowledge between tasks with shared transition dynamics. This paper presents
Model Features: a feature representation that clusters behaviourally equivalent
states and that is equivalent to a Model-Reduction. Further, we present a
Successor Feature model which shows that learning Successor Features is
equivalent to learning a Model-Reduction. A novel optimization objective is
developed and we provide bounds showing that minimizing this objective results
in an increasingly improved approximation of a Model-Reduction. Further, we
provide transfer experiments on randomly generated MDPs which vary in their
transition and reward functions but approximately preserve behavioural
equivalence between states. These results demonstrate that Model Features are
suitable for transfer between tasks with varying transition and reward

\fermi, and \swift, to provide insights into the physical mechanisms of the
prompt radiation and the jet geometry.
  Prompt emission from \thisgrb\ was very bright (fluence
$>10^{-4}$~ergs~cm$^{-2}$) and had a complex structure composed of the
superimposition of several pulses. The energy spectra deviate from the typical
Band function to show a low energy peak $\sim 15$~keV --- which we interpret as
a power-law with two breaks, with a synchrotron origin. Alternately, the prompt
spectra can also be interpreted as Comptonized emission, or a blackbody
combined with a Band function. Time-resolved analysis confirms the presence of
the low energy component, while the peak energy is found to be confined in the
range of 100--200~keV.
  Afterglow emission detected by \fermi-LAT is typical of an external shock
model, and we constrain the initial Lorentz factor using the peak time of the
emission. \swift-XRT measurements of the afterglow show an indication for a jet
break, allowing us to constrain the jet opening angle to $>$ 6$\degr$.
  Detection of a large number of Compton scattered events by \asat-CZTI
provides an opportunity to study hard X-ray polarization of the prompt
emission. We find that the burst has high, time-variable polarization, with the
emission {\bf have higher polarization} at energies above the peak energy.
  We discuss all observations in the context of GRB models and polarization
arising due to {\bf due to physical or geometric effects:} synchrotron emission
from multiple shocks with ordered or random magnetic fields, Poynting flux
dominated jet undergoing abrupt magnetic dissipation, sub-photospheric
dissipation, a jet consisting of fragmented fireballs, and the Comptonization

the formation of accent is related to pronunciation patterns of both the target

to use two native speech acoustic models, one trained on L2 speech and the
other trained on L1 speech. We develop two sets of measurements that can be
extracted from two acoustic models given accented speech. A new utterance-level
feature extraction scheme is used to convert these measurements into a
fixed-dimension vector which is used as an input to a statistical model to
predict the accentedness of a speaker. On a data set consisting of speakers

Absorbing galaxies are selected via the detection of characteristic
absorption lines which their gas-rich media imprint in the spectra of distant
light-beacons. The proximity of the typically faint foreground absorbing
galaxies to bright background sources makes it challenging to robustly identify
these in emission, and hence to characterise their relation to the general
galaxy population. Aims. We search for emission to confirm and characterise ten
galaxies hosting damped, metal-rich quasar absorbers at redshift z < 1.
Methods. We identify the absorbing galaxies by matching spectroscopic
absorption -and emission redshifts and from projected separations. Combining
emission-line diagnostics with existing absorption spectroscopy and photometry
of quasar-fields hosting metal-rich, damped absorbers, we compare our new
detections with reference samples and place them on scaling relations. Results.
We spectroscopically confirm seven galaxies harbouring damped absorbers (a 70%
success-rate). Our results conform to the emerging picture that neutral gas on
scales of tens of kpc in galaxies is what causes the characteristic Hi
absorption. Our key results are: (I) Absorbing galaxies with $\log _{10}
[M_\star ~(M_\odot)] \gtrsim 10$ have star formation rates that are lower than
predicted for the main sequence of star formation. (II) The distribution of
impact parameter with Hi column density and with absorption-metallicity for
absorbing galaxies at $z\sim 2-3$ extends to $z\sim 0.7$ and to lower Hi column
densities. (III) A robust mean metallicity gradient of $\langle \Gamma \rangle
= 0.022 \pm 0.001~[dex~kpc^{-1}]$. (IV) By correcting absorption metallicities
for $\langle \Gamma \rangle$ and imposing a truncation-radius at
$12~\mathrm{kpc}$, absorbing galaxies fall on top of predicted mass-metallicity
relations, with a statistically significant decrease in scatter.

Within this framework, options with different strikes and maturities for one

and the Mabuchi K-energy on a one-dimensional complex manifold. To the best of
our knowledge this is the first rigorous construction of such an object and
this is done by means of probabilistic tools. Both functionals play an
important role respectively in Riemannian geometry (in the case of surfaces)
and K\""ahler geometry. As an output, we obtain a path integral whose Weyl
anomaly displays the standard Liouville anomaly plus an additional K-energy
term. Motivations come from theoretical physics where these type of path
integrals arise as a model for fluctuating metrics on surfaces when coupling
(small) massive perturbations of conformal field theories to quantum gravity as
advocated by A. Bilal, F. Ferrari, S. Klevtsov and S. Zelditch. Interestingly,
our computations show that quantum corrections perturb the classical Mabuchi
K-energy and produce a quantum Mabuchi K-energy: this type of correction is
reminiscent of the quantum Liouville theory. Our construction is probabilistic
and relies on a variant of Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC), the Derivative
GMC (DGMC for short). The technical backbone of our construction consists in
two estimates on (derivative and standard) GMC which are of independent
interest in probability theory. Firstly, we show that these DGMC random
variables possess negative exponential moments and secondly we derive optimal
small deviations estimates for the GMC associated with a recentered Gaussian
Free Field.

novel image representation to inverse problems in medical imaging in which the
original inverse problem was formulated as a constraint optimization problem
and solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)

several pre-processing steps (scaling, trimming) motivated by human practice

for a strict determination of the conditions leading to finite life times in a

derived conditions apply in practice, we consider the effect of driving in a
system with purely discrete energy spectrum, as well as in a system for which
the eigenvalue spectrum contains a continuous part. We show that in the first
case, when the driving contains a dense set of frequencies acting as a noise to
the system, the corresponding bound states acquire a finite life time. When the
energy spectrum contains also a continuum set of eigenvalues then the bound
states, due to the driving, couple to the continuum and become quasi-bound

single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging using only the SPECT
emission data is highly significant. In this context, attenuation in SPECT is
primarily due to Compton scattering, where the probability of Compton scatter
is proportional to the attenuation coefficient of the tissue and the energy of
the scattered photon and the scattering angle are related. Given this premise,
we investigate whether the SPECT scattered-photon data acquired in list-mode
(LM) format and including the energy information can be used to estimate the
attenuation map. For this purpose, we propose a Fisher-information-based method
that yields the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the task of jointly estimating the
activity/attenuation distribution using only the SPECT emission data. The
proposed method is applied to analyze the information content of SPECT LM
emission data in a 2D SPECT system using computational studies with digital
phantoms for different photon-count levels. The results show that scattered
photons contain information to estimate the attenuation coefficients. An
increase in the number of detected photons leads to lower CRB for both the
attenuation and activity coefficients. Also, the CRB obtained for the
attenuation and activity coefficients is typically much lower than the true
value of these coefficients. Further, processing the emission data in LM format
yields a lower CRB in comparison to binning data. Finally, we observe that
systems with better energy resolution yield a lower CRB for the attenuation
coefficient. Overall, the results provide strong evidence that LM SPECT
emission data, including the scattered photons, contains information to jointly
estimate the activity and attenuation coefficients.

from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a major intracellular Ca store. However,
under abnormal conditions Ca leaks from the SR, decreasing heart contraction
amplitude and increasing risk of life-threatening arrhythmia. The mechanisms
and regimes of SR operation generating the abnormal Ca leak remain unclear.
Here we employed both numerical and analytical modeling to get mechanistic
insights into the emergent Ca leak phenomenon. Our numerical simulations using
a detailed realistic model of Ca release unit (CRU) reveal sharp transitions
resulting in Ca leak. The emergence of leak is closely mapped mathematically to
the Ising model from statistical mechanics. The system steady-state behavior is
determined by two aggregate parameters: the analogues of magnetic field ($h$)
and the inverse temperature ($\beta$) in the Ising model, for which we have
explicit formulas in terms of SR Ca and release channel opening/closing rates.
The classification of leak regimes takes the shape of a phase $\beta$-$h$
diagram, with the regime boundaries occurring at $h$=0 and a critical value of
$\beta$ ($\beta*$) which we estimate using a classical Ising model and mean
field theory. Our theory predicts that a synchronized Ca leak will occur when
$h$>0 and $\beta>\beta*$ and a disordered leak occurs when $\beta<\beta*$ and
$h$ is not too negative. The disorder leak is distinguished from synchronized
leak (in long-lasting sparks) by larger Peierls contour lengths, an output
parameter reflecting degree of disorder. Thus, in addition to our detailed
numerical model approach we also offer an instantaneous computational tool
using analytical formulas of the Ising model for respective RyR parameters and
SR Ca load that describe and classify phase transitions and leak emergence.

X-ray sources. Ambiguous counterpart associations, expensive optical
spectroscopy and/or multimission multiwavelength coverage to resolve
degeneracies make estimation often difficult in practice.
  Aims: We attempt to constrain redshifts of obscured Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN) using only low-resolution X-ray spectra.
  Methods: Our XZ method fits AGN X-ray spectra with a moderately complex
spectral model incorporating a corona, torus obscurer and warm mirror. Using
the Bayesian X-ray Astronomy (BXA) package, we constrain redshift, column
density, photon index and luminosity simultaneously. The redshift information
primarily comes from absorption edges in Compton-thin AGN, and from the Fe
K$\alpha$ fluorescent line in heavily obscured AGN. A new generic background
fitting method allows us to extract more information from limited numbers of
source counts.
  Results: We derive redshift constraints for 74/321 hard-band detected sources
in the Chandra deep field South. Comparing with spectroscopic redshifts, we
find an outlier fraction of 8%, indicating that our model assumptions are
valid. For three Chandra deep fields, we release our XZ redshift estimates.
  Conclusions: The independent XZ estimate is easy to apply and effective for a
large fraction of obscured AGN in todays deep surveys without the need for any
additional data. Comparing to different redshift estimation methods, XZ can
resolve degeneracies in photometric redshifts, help to detect potential
association problems and confirm uncertain single-line spectroscopic redshifts.
With high spectral resolution and large collecting area, this technique will be
highly effective for Athena/WFI observations.

Previous work has used a tree-to-tree encoder/decoder model to take advantage

In this paper, we describe a tree decoder that leverages knowledge of a

protocol two macroscopically different chains (leads) are joined together at

entropies of a finite subsystem at the interface between the two leads. The
density of R\'enyi entropies coincides with that of the entropies of the
Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) that describes the interface between the

not allowed. Moreover, we show that there is a `critical' anisotropy, above

users is to rewrite the original query resulting in a set of approximations.
Several strategies have been proposed in past to address this. They typically
move up the taxonomy to relax a specific element to a more generic element.
Entities don't have a taxonomy and they end up being generalized. To address
this issue, in this paper, we propose an entity centric reformulation strategy

$\Lambda$ or tripod schemes, as there is no loop in such atom-light couplings.
One can identify different regions of spatially structured transparency through
measuring the absorption of probe field under different configurations of

balancing problems. In this paper, we study a new scenario, which we call the
ball recycling game, defined as follows:
  Throw m balls into n bins i.i.d. according to a given probability
distribution p. Then, at each time step, pick a non-empty bin and recycle its
balls: take the balls from the selected bin and re-throw them according to p.
  This balls-and-bins game closely models memory-access heuristics in
databases. The goal is to have a bin-picking method that maximizes the
recycling rate, defined to be the expected number of balls recycled per step in
the stationary distribution. We study two natural strategies for ball
recycling: Fullest Bin, which greedily picks the bin with the maximum number of
balls, and Random Ball, which picks a ball at random and recycles its bin. We
show that for general p, Random Ball is constant-optimal, whereas Fullest Bin
can be pessimal. However, when p = u, the uniform distribution, Fullest Bin is
optimal to within an additive constant.

asymmetric arrangement of atoms are quantum mechanically correlated more
strongly than systems having symmetric arrangements. The variable nature of HF
coupling leads to the increase of both concurrence and discord from zero to a
saturation value from where they decrease to zero as a function of inter-atomic
distance. Further separation leads to both the quantities attaining another
saturation value. This controlled correlations play an important role in the
design of quantum data buses that can transfer quantum states to establish
quantum communication. The systems coupled via HF coupling will be efficient
for this task as they are maximally entangled in parametrically controlled

shapes, retrieving 3D shapes by sketches is a significantly challenging task.
To address this problem, we propose a novel framework to learn a discriminative
deep cross-modality adaptation model in this paper. Specifically, we first
separately adopt two metric networks, following two deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), to learn modality-specific discriminative features based on an
importance-aware metric learning method. Subsequently, we explicitly introduce
a cross-modality transformation network to compensate for the divergence
between two modalities, which can transfer features of 2D sketches to the
feature space of 3D shapes. We develop an adversarial learning based method to
train the transformation model, by simultaneously enhancing the holistic
correlations between data distributions of two modalities, and mitigating the
local semantic divergences through minimizing a cross-modality mean discrepancy
term. Experimental results on the SHREC 2013 and SHREC 2014 datasets clearly
show the superior retrieval performance of our proposed model, compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

as a canonical model system to investigate the underlying physical properties

explore the critical role of SOC on the electronic structure and magnetic
properties of Sr3MIrO6. The crystal-field splitting combined with correlation
effects are insufficient to account for the insulating nature, but the SOC
interactions is the intrinsic source to trigger the insulating ground states in
these hexagonal iridates. The decreasing geometry connectivity of IrO6
octahedra gives rise to the increasing of effective electronic correlations and
SOC interactions, tuning the hexagonal iridates from low-spin Jeff = 1/2 states
with large local magnetic moments for the Ir4+ (5d5) ions in Sr4IrO6 to
nonmagnetic singlet Jeff = 0 states without magnetic moments for the Ir5+ (5d4)

particularly well suited for treatment of CAD-generated geometries. Fej\'er's
first quadrature rule is incorporated in the algorithm, to provide a spectrally
accurate method for evaluation of contributions from far integration regions,
while highly-accurate precomputations of singular and near-singular integrals
over certain ""surface patches"" together with two-dimensional Chebyshev
transforms and suitable surface-varying ""rectangular-polar"" changes of

the linear-algebra solver GMRES to produce solutions for sound-soft open- and
closed-surface scattering obstacles, including an application to an aircraft
described by means of a CAD representation. The approach is robust, fast, and
highly accurate: use of a few points per wavelength suffices for the algorithm

various site-exciton models with respect to the accurate results of quantum
dynamics method multilayer multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree

few of prototypes used in the description of photoinduced excitonic dynamics
processes in photoharvesting systems and organic solar cells, which include the
rather board situations with the fast or slow bath and different system-bath
couplings. When the characteristic frequency of the bath is low, the MM-SQC
method performs extremely well, and it gives almost the identical results to
those of ML-MCTDH. When the fast bath is considered, the deviations exist
between the MM-SQC and ML-MCTDH results if the high-frequency bath modes are
improperly treated by the classical manner. When the so-called adiabatic
renormalization was employed to construct the reduced Hamiltonian by freezing
high-frequency modes, the MM-SQC dynamics can give the results comparable to
the ML-MCTDH ones. Thus, the MM-SQC method itself provide reasonable results in
all test site-exciton models, while the proper treatments of the bath modes
must be employed. The possible dependence of the MM-SQC dynamics on the
different initial sampling methods for the nuclear degrees of freedom is also

neutrino flux above $5\times 10^{6}$ GeV based on an analysis of nine years of
IceCube data. The astrophysical neutrino flux measured by IceCube extends to
PeV energies, and it is a background flux when searching for an independent
signal flux at higher energies, such as the cosmogenic neutrino signal. We have
developed a new method to place robust limits on the EHE neutrino flux in the
presence of an astrophysical background, whose spectrum has yet to be
understood with high precision at PeV energies. A distinct event with a
deposited energy above $10^{6}$ GeV was found in the new two-year sample, in
addition to the one event previously found in the seven-year EHE neutrino
search. These two events represent a neutrino flux that is incompatible with
predictions for a cosmogenic neutrino flux and are considered to be an
astrophysical background in the current study. The obtained limit is the most
stringent to date in the energy range between $5 \times 10^{6}$ and $5 \times
10^{10}$ GeV. This result constrains neutrino models predicting a three-flavor
neutrino flux of $E_\nu^2\phi_{\nu_e+\nu_\mu+\nu_\tau}\simeq2\times 10^{-8}\
{\rm GeV}/{\rm cm}^2\ \sec\ {\rm sr}$ at $10^9\ {\rm GeV}$. A significant part
of the parameter-space for EHE neutrino production scenarios assuming a
proton-dominated composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is excluded.

relationship has been observed between the evolution of the genetic code and
the three domain tree of life. The existence of such a remote relationship need
to be explained. The unity of the living system throughout the history of life
relies on the common features of life: the homochirality, the genetic code and
the universal genome format. The universal genome format has been observed in
the genomic codon distributions as a common feature of life at the sequence
level. A main aim of this article is to reconstruct and to explain the
Phanerozoic biodiversity curve. It has been observed that the exponential
growth rate of the Phanerozoic biodiversity curve is about equal to the
exponential growth rate of genome size evolution. Hence it is strongly
indicated that the expansion of genomes causes the exponential trend of the
Phanerozoic biodiversity curve, where the conservative property during the
evolution of life is guaranteed by the universal genome format at the sequence
level. In addition, a consensus curve based on the climatic and eustatic data
is obtained to explain the fluctuations of the Phanerozoic biodiversity curve.
Thus, the reconstructed biodiversity curve based on genomic, climatic and
eustatic data agrees with Sepkoski's curve based on fossil data. The five mass
extinctions can be discerned in this reconstructed biodiversity curve, which
indicates a tectonic cause of the mass extinctions. And the declining
origination rate and extinction rate throughout the Phanerozoic eon might be
due to the growth trend in genome size evolution.

They address a bias-variance trade off between reliance on current estimates,
which could be poor, and incorporating longer sampled reward sequences into the
updates. Especially in the off-policy setting, where the agent aims to learn
about a policy different from the one generating its behaviour, the variance in
the updates can cause learning to diverge as the number of sampled rewards used
in the estimates increases. In this paper, we introduce per-decision control
variates for multi-step TD algorithms, and compare them to existing methods.
Our results show that including the control variates can greatly improve
performance on both on and off-policy multi-step temporal difference learning

effectiveness evaluation, taking into account semantics of executed code along
with a quantitative assessment. For this purpose, we use specific metrics of
source code complexity assessment adapted to perform analysis of machine code.
We conducted effectiveness evaluation of these metrics on 104 widespread
applications with known vulnerabilities. As a result of these experiments, we
were able to identify a set of metrics that are more suitable to find bugs. In
addition, we conducted separate experiments on 7 applications without known
vulnerabilities by using the set of metrics. The experimental results confirmed
that proposed approach can be applied to increase performance of the fuzzing.
Moreover, the tools helped detect two critical zero day (previously unknown)

quasi-molecules is investigated. The notations $a, b, c$ stand for the bare
nuclei of three hydrogen isotopes - protium ($p$), deuterium ($d$) and tritium
($t$). All these systems are the Coulomb five- and six-body systems with unit
charges. It is found that the ground bound $S(L = 0)-$states are stable in all
six five-body $a b \mu e_2$ ions and in ten six-body $a b c \mu e_2$
quasi-molecules. As follows from accurate variational computations of the
five-body $a b \mu e_2$ ions their internal structure is similar to the
internal structure of the negatively charged hydrogen ion H$^{-}$. Analogously,
we show that the internal structures of the six-body neutral $a b c \mu e_2$
quasi-molecules are similar to the structure of the two-center H$_{2}$ molecule
which contains two heavy hydrogen nuclei and two bound electrons.

hole due to an energy-momentum flux flowing through the black-hole horizon. The
leading-order terms of this horizon flux introduce 2.5 and 3.5 post-Newtonian
corrections to inspiral motions of binary black holes. The corrections may be
measurable by gravitational waves detectors. Since the proper improvements to
general relativity is still a mystery, it is possible that the true modified
gravity theory introduces negligible direct corrections to the geodesics of
test masses, while near horizon corrections are observable. We introduce a
parameterization to describe arbitrary mass and spin growth of inspiralling
black holes. Comparing signals of gravitational waves and a waveform model with
parameterized horizon flux corrections, deviations from general relativity can
be constrained. We simulate a set of gravitational waves signals following an
astrophysical distribution with horizon flux modifications. Then, we perform a
Bayesian analysis to obtain the expected constraints from the simulated
response of the Advanced LIGO-Virgo detector network to the simulated signals.
We show that the constraint can be improved by stacking multiple detections.
The constraints of modified horizon flux can be used to test a specific class
of modified gravity theories which predict dominant corrections near black-hole
horizons over other types of corrections to general relativity. To support
Hawking's area theorem at 90\% confidence level, over 10000 LIGO-Virgo
detections are required. Within the lifetime of LIGO and Einstein Telescope, a
future ground-based gravitational wave detector, near horizon corrections of
modified gravity theories are potentially detectable if one of the modified
gravity theory is true and the theory predicts a strong correction.

this end, we propose a general methodology which incorporates the pre-estimator

proposed strategy exhibits a more aggressive normalized forgetting effect

it is a universal law or a statistical artifact, and little is known about what
mechanisms may have shaped it. To answer these questions, this study conducted
a large scale cross language investigation into Zipf's law. The statistical
results show that Zipf's laws in 50 languages all share a 3-segment structural
pattern, with each segment demonstrating distinctive linguistic properties and
the lower segment invariably bending downwards to deviate from theoretical
expectation. This finding indicates that this deviation is a fundamental and
universal feature of word frequency distributions in natural languages, not the
statistical error of low frequency words. A computer simulation based on the
dual-process theory yields Zipf's law with the same structural pattern,
suggesting that Zipf's law of natural languages are motivated by common
cognitive mechanisms. These results show that Zipf's law in languages is
motivated by cognitive mechanisms like dual-processing that govern human verbal

freedom of the intrinsic dissipation. Our framework can be applied to systems
in contact with thermostats put out of equilibrium by an external driving but
it holds also for intrinsically dissipative macroscopic systems that go at rest
when the forcing is stopped. Moreover, we are not concerned about the
fluctuations around zero of the smoothed injected power that can be extremely
rare and difficult to catch experimentally. Then we show that the
characteristic energy density we defined, reduces to the kinetic energy of a
Brownian-like particle described by a set of Langevin equations with a viscous
damping term. The particle can be either in contact with a thermostat or
intrinsically dissipative and driven by a random force. In the first case, we
recover the result obtained in the framework of the fluctuation relation but
extended to a correlated thermal noise. Our characteristic energy density is
measured in an experimental system of nonlinear waves generated by a large
shaker in a thin elastic plate. A smaller shaker attached to the moving plate
is used as a probe to measure the energy exchanged with the plate excited by
the large shaker. For both, the proportionality of our characteristic energy
density with the kinetic energy is demonstrated. It is a consequence of the
viscous damping driving the dissipation in this system. Another system with
nonlinear frictional dissipation is investigated numerically model. In this
case, our definition of energy density deduced from fluctuations of injected
power still characterizes the dissipation but is no more proportional to the
kinetic energy because the dissipative process is not a viscous damping.

been improved in the past few years. They are based on the time-dependent
Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory and its extensions to include pairing correlations
and quantum fluctuations. The TDHF theory is the lowest level of approximation
of a range of methods to solve the quantum many-body problem, showing its
universality to describe many-fermion dynamics at the mean-field level. The
range of applications of TDHF to describe realistic systems allowing for
detailed comparisons with experiment has considerably increased. For instance,
TDHF is now commonly used to investigate fusion, multi-nucleon transfer and
quasi-fission reactions. Thanks to the inclusion of pairing correlations, it
has also recently led to breakthroughs in our description of the saddle to
scission evolution, and, in particular, the non-adiabatic effects near
scission. Beyond mean-field approaches such as the time-dependent random-phase
approximation (TDRPA) and stochastic mean-field methods have reached the point
where they can be used for realistic applications. We review recent progresses
in both techniques and applications to heavy-ion collision and fission.

services and frameworks are provided to help customers develop and deploy
machine learning applications. While it is prevalent to outsource model
training and serving tasks in the cloud, it is important to protect the privacy
of sensitive samples in the training dataset and prevent information leakage to
untrusted third parties. Past work have shown that a malicious machine learning
service provider or end user can easily extract critical information about the
training samples, from the model parameters or even just model outputs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel and generic methodology to preserve the
privacy of training data in machine learning applications. Specifically we
introduce an obfuscate function and apply it to the training data before
feeding them to the model training task. This function adds random noise to
existing samples, or augments the dataset with new samples. By doing so
sensitive information about the properties of individual samples, or
statistical properties of a group of samples, is hidden. Meanwhile the model
trained from the obfuscated dataset can still achieve high accuracy. With this
approach, the customers can safely disclose the data or models to third-party
providers or end users without the need to worry about data privacy. Our
experiments show that this approach can effective defeat four existing types of
machine learning privacy attacks at negligible accuracy cost.

to fragmentation we perform simulation of liquid-tin droplet expansion produced
by the initial conditions similar to those in experiment using the smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Simulation demonstrates that a thin heated
surface layer generates a ultrashort shock wave propagating from the frontal
side to rear side of the droplet. Convergence of such shock wave followed by a
rarefaction tale to the droplet center results in the cavitation of material
inside the central region by the strong tensile stress. Reflection of the shock
wave from the rear side of droplet produces another region of highly stretched
material where the spallation may occur producing a thin spallation layer
moving with a velocity higher than expansion of the central shell after
cavitation. It is shown both experimentally and numerically that the threshold
laser intensity necessary for the spallation is higher than the threshold
required to induce cavitation in the central region of droplet. Thus, the
regime of asymmetrical expansion is realized if the laser intensity exceeds the
spallation threshold. The transverse and longitudinal expansion velocities
obtained in SPH simulations of different regimes of expansion are agreed well
with our experimental data.

satellite platform. In contrast to consumer, movie, and common surveillance
videos, satellite video can record the snapshot of the city-scale scene. In a
broad field-of-view of satellite videos, each moving target would be very tiny
and usually composed of several pixels in frames. Even worse, the noise signals
also existed in the video frames, since the background of the video frame has
the subpixel-level and uneven moving thanks to the motion of satellites. We
argue that this is a new type of computer vision task since previous
technologies are unable to detect such tiny vehicles efficiently. This paper
proposes a novel framework that can identify the small moving vehicles in
satellite videos. In particular, we offer a novel detecting algorithm based on
the local noise modeling. We differentiate the potential vehicle targets from
noise patterns by an exponential probability distribution. Subsequently, a
multi-morphological-cue based discrimination strategy is designed to
distinguish correct vehicle targets from a few existing noises further. Another
significant contribution is to introduce a series of evaluation protocols to
measure the performance of tiny moving vehicle detection systematically. We
annotate a satellite video manually and use it to test our algorithms under
different evaluation criterion. The proposed algorithm is also compared with
the state-of-the-art baselines, and demonstrates the advantages of our
framework over the benchmarks.

damage on a road surface. To achieve the millimetre accuracy required for road
condition assessment, a disparity map with subpixel resolution needs to be
used. However, none of the existing stereo matching algorithms are specially
suitable for the reconstruction of the road surface. Hence in this paper, we
propose a novel dense subpixel disparity estimation algorithm with high
computational efficiency and robustness. This is achieved by first transforming
the perspective view of the target frame into the reference view, which not
only increases the accuracy of the block matching for the road surface but also
improves the processing speed. The disparities are then estimated iteratively
using our previously published algorithm where the search range is propagated
from three estimated neighbouring disparities. Since the search range is
obtained from the previous iteration, errors may occur when the propagated
search range is not sufficient. Therefore, a correlation maxima verification is
performed to rectify this issue, and the subpixel resolution is achieved by
conducting a parabola interpolation enhancement. Furthermore, a novel disparity
global refinement approach developed from the Markov Random Fields and Fast
Bilateral Stereo is introduced to further improve the accuracy of the estimated
disparity map, where disparities are updated iteratively by minimising the
energy function that is related to their interpolated correlation polynomials.
The algorithm is implemented in C language with a near real-time performance.
The experimental results illustrate that the absolute error of the
reconstruction varies from 0.1 mm to 3 mm.

various systems. However, protocols based on squeezed vacuum crucially rely on
precise control of the relative orientation of the squeezing with respect to

amplification of noise and reduces the sensitivity of the device. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate a novel quantum metrological paradigm based on phase

surprisingly, a Markovian process in dimension $1$ that satisfies
self-similarity properties of a general form can indeed be represented as a
function of a time-changed L\'evy process, which shows some kind of
universality for the classical Lamperti representation in dimension $1$.
However, and this is our main result, we show that a Markovian process in
dimension $2$ that satisfies self-similarity properties of a general form is
represented as a function of a time-changed exponential functional of a
bivariate L\'evy process, and processes that can be represented as a function
of a time-changed L\'evy process form a strict subclass. This shows that the
classical Lamperti representation is not universal in dimension $2$. We briefly
discuss the complications that occur in higher dimensions. In dimension $2$ we
present an example, built from a self-similar fragmentation process, where our
representation in term of an exponential functional of a bivariate L\'evy
process appears naturally and has a nice interpretation in term of the
self-similar fragmentation process.

Accepted for publication Physical Review D",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.98.023015",,"astro-ph.HE physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the Milky Way galaxy, positrons, which are responsible for the diffuse
$511\,\mathrm{keV}$ gamma ray emission observed by space-based gamma ray
observatories, are thought to annihilate predominantly through charge exchange
interactions with neutral hydrogen. These charge exchange interactions can only
take place if positrons have energies greater than $6.8\,\mathrm{eV}$, the
minimum energy required to liberate the electron bound to the hydrogen atom and
then form positronium, a short-lived bound state composed of a
positron-electron pair. Here we demonstrate the importance of positron
interactions with neutral alkali metals in the warm interstellar medium (ISM).
Positrons may undergo charge exchange with these atoms at any energy. In
particular, we show that including positron interactions with sodium at solar
abundance in the warm ISM can significantly reduce the annihilation timescale
of positrons with energies below $6.8\,\mathrm{eV}$ by at least an order of
magnitude. We show that including these interactions in our understanding of
positron annihilation in the Milky Way rules out the idea that the number of
positrons in the Galactic ISM could be maintained in steady state by injection
events occurring at a typical periodicity $>\mathrm{Myr}$.

fixed-size anchor boxes to guide the search for text instances. They usually
rely on a large amount of anchors with different scales to discover texts in
scene images, thus leading to high computational cost. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end box-based text detector with scale-adaptive anchors,
which can dynamically adjust the scales of anchors according to the sizes of
underlying texts by introducing an additional scale regression layer. The
proposed scale-adaptive anchors allow us to use a few number of anchors to
handle multi-scale texts and therefore significantly improve the computational
efficiency. Moreover, compared to discrete scales used in previous methods, the
learned continuous scales are more reliable, especially for small texts
detection. Additionally, we propose Anchor convolution to better exploit
necessary feature information by dynamically adjusting the sizes of receptive
fields according to the learned scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed detector is fast, taking only $0.28$ second per image, while
outperforming most state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.

coupled-wave analysis demonstrate the existence of sharp resonant features and
bound states in the continuum (BICs) in the reflectance and the transmittance
spectra occurring at oblique incidence of a TE-polarized guided mode on the
ridge. Using the effective index method, we explain the resonances by the
excitation of the cross-polarized modes of the ridge. The formation of the BICs
is confirmed using a theoretical model based on the coupled-wave theory. The
model suggests that the BICs occur due to coupling of quasi-TE and quasi-TM
modes of the structure. Simple analytical expressions for the angle of
incidence and the ridge width predicting the location of the BICs are obtained.
The existence of high-Q resonances and BICs makes the considered integrated
structure promising for filtering, sensing, transformation of optical signals,

has been detected. However, there is some controversy about the spectral type
of R Mon. Some authors propose that it could be a later B8e star, where disks
are more common. We have re-evaluated the spectral type of R Mon using the
available continuum data and UVES emission lines. We used a power-law disk
model to fit previous 12 CO 1-0 and 2-1 interferometric observations and the
PACS CO data to investigate the disk structure. Interferometric detections of
13 CO J=1-0, HCO+ 1-0, and CN 1-0 lines using the IRAM Plateau de Bure
Interferometer (PdBI) are presented. The HCN 1-0 line was not detected. Our
analysis confirms that R Mon is a B0 star. The disk model compatible with the
12 CO 1-0 and 2-1 interferometric observations falls short of predicting the
observed fluxes of the 14<Ju<31 PACS lines; this is consistent with the
scenario in which some contribution to these lines is coming from a warm
envelope and/or UV-illuminated outflow walls. More interestingly, the upper
limits to the fluxes of the Ju>31 CO lines suggest the existence of a region
empty of CO at R<20 au in the proto-planetary disk. The intense emission of the
HCO+ and CN lines shows the strong influence of UV photons on gas chemistry.
The observations gathered in this paper are consistent with the presence around
R Mon of a transition disk with a cavity about 20 au. This size is similar to

with offset (AVO) data into lithology/fluid classes, and study in particular
how the choice of prior distribution for the lithology/fluid classes influences
the inversion results. Two distinct prior distributions are considered, a
simple manually specified Markov random field prior with a first order
neighborhood and a Markov mesh model with a much larger neighborhood estimated
from a training image. They are chosen to model both horisontal connectivity
and vertical thickness distribution of the lithology/fluid classes, and are
compared on an offshore clastic oil reservoir in the North Sea. We combine both
priors with the same linearised Gaussian likelihood function based on a
convolved linearised Zoeppritz relation and estimate properties of the
resulting two posterior distributions by simulating from these distributions
with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
  The influence of the prior on the marginal posterior probabilities for the
lithology/fluid classes is clearly observable, but modest. The importance of
the prior on the connectivity properties in the posterior realisations,
however, is much stronger. The larger neighborhood of the Markov mesh prior
enables it to identify and model connectivity and curvature much better than
what can be done by the first order neighborhood Markov random field prior. As
a result, we conclude that the posterior realisations based on the Markov mesh
prior appear with much higher lateral connectivity, which is geologically
plausible.

curves, and the remaining characteristic curves can be viewed as paths of
'ghostpeakons' with zero amplitude; hence, they can be obtained as solutions of
the ODEs governing the dynamics of multipeakon solutions. The previously known
solution formulas for multipeakons only cover the case when all amplitudes are
nonzero, since they are based upon inverse spectral methods unable to detect
the ghostpeakons. We show how to overcome this problem by taking a suitable

to become zero. Moreover, we use direct integration to compute the
characteristic curves for the solution of the Degasperis-Procesi equation where
a shockpeakon forms at a peakon-antipeakon collision. In addition to the
theoretical interest in knowing the characteristic curves, they are also useful
for plotting multipeakon solutions, as we illustrate in several examples.

leakage is measured by the probability of error of the binary hypothesis test
carried out by the AD. A management unit (MU) is allowed to manipulate the
original data sequence in an online fashion, while satisfying an average
distortion constraint. The goal of the MU is to maximize the minimal type II
probability of error subject to a constraint on the type I probability of error
assuming an adversarial Neyman-Pearson test, or to maximize the minimal error
probability assuming an adversarial Bayesian test. The asymptotic exponents of
the maximum minimal type II probability of error and the maximum minimal error
probability are shown to be characterized by a Kullback-Leibler divergence rate
and a Chernoff information rate, respectively. Privacy performances of
particular management policies, the memoryless hypothesis-aware policy and the
hypothesis-unaware policy with memory, are compared. The proposed formulation
can also model adversarial example generation with minimal data manipulation to
fool classifiers. Lastly, the results are applied to a smart meter privacy
problem, where the user's energy consumption is manipulated by adaptively using
a renewable energy source in order to hide user's activity from the energy
provider.

  Learning Control",,,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Highly dynamic tasks that require large accelerations and precise tracking
usually rely on accurate models and/or high gain feedback. While kinematic
optimization allows for efficient representation and online generation of
hitting trajectories, learning to track such dynamic movements with inaccurate
models remains an open problem. In particular, stability issues surrounding the
learning performance, in the iteration domain, can prevent the successful
implementation of model based learning approaches. To achieve accurate tracking
for such tasks in a stable and efficient way, we propose a new adaptive
Iterative Learning Control (ILC) algorithm that is implemented efficiently
using a recursive approach. Moreover, covariance estimates of model matrices
are used to exercise caution during learning. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed approach in extensive simulations and in our robotic table tennis
platform, where we show how the striking performance of two seven degree of
freedom anthropomorphic robot arms can be optimized. Our implementation on the
table tennis platform compares favorably with high-gain PD-control, model-free
ILC (simple PD feedback type) and model-based ILC without cautious adaptation.

subgraphs of size $k$ in a graph $G$ that satisfy a given property $\Phi$. This
continues the work of Jerrum and Meeks who proved the problem to be
$\#\mathrm{W[1]}$-hard for some families of properties which include, among
others, (dis)connectedness [JCSS 15] and even- or oddness of the number of
edges [Combinatorica 17]. Using the recent framework of graph motif parameters
due to Curticapean, Dell and Marx [STOC 17], we discover that for monotone
properties $\Phi$, the problem $\#\mathsf{IndSub}(\Phi)$ is hard for
$\#\mathrm{W[1]}$ if the reduced Euler characteristic of the associated
simplicial (graph) complex of $\Phi$ is non-zero. This observation links
$\#\mathsf{IndSub}(\Phi)$ to Karp's famous Evasiveness Conjecture, as every
graph complex with non-vanishing reduced Euler characteristic is known to be
evasive. Applying tools from the ""topological approach to evasiveness"" which
was introduced in the seminal paper of Khan, Saks and Sturtevant [FOCS 83], we
prove that $\#\mathsf{IndSub}(\Phi)$ is $\#\mathrm{W[1]}$-hard for every
monotone property $\Phi$ that does not hold on the Hamilton cycle as well as
for some monotone properties that hold on the Hamilton cycle such as being
triangle-free or not $k$-edge-connected for $k > 2$. Moreover, we show that for
those properties $\#\mathsf{IndSub}(\Phi)$ can not be solved in time $f(k)\cdot
n^{o(k)}$ for any computable function $f$ unless the Exponential Time
Hypothesis (ETH) fails. In the final part of the paper, we investigate
non-monotone properties and prove that $\#\mathsf{IndSub}(\Phi)$ is
$\#\mathrm{W[1]}$-hard if $\Phi$ is any non-trivial modularity constraint on
the number of edges with respect to some prime $q$ or if $\Phi$ enforces the
presence of a fixed isolated subgraph.

of the branching property so that it becomes applicable for historical and
genealogical processes (using the coding of genealogies by ($V$-marked)
ultrametric measure spaces leading to state spaces $\mathbb{U}$ resp.
$\mathbb{U}^V$). The processes are defined by well-posed martingale problems.
In particular we want to complement the corresponding concept of infinite
divisibility developed in \cite{infdiv} for this context. Second one of the two
main points, we want to find a corresponding characterization of the generators
of branching processes more precisely their martingale problems which is both
easy to apply and general enough to cover a wide range of state spaces. As a
third goal we want to obtain the branching property of the $\mathbb{U}$-valued
Feller diffusion respectively $\mathbb{U}^V$-valued super random walk and the
historical process on countable geographic spaces the latter as two examples of
a whole zoo of spatial processes we could treat. The fourth goal is to show the
robustness of the method and to get the branching property for genealogies
marked with ancestral path, giving the line of descent moving through the
ancestors and space, leading to path-marked ultra-metric measure spaces. This
processes are constructed here giving our second major result. The starting
point for all four points is the Feller diffusion model, the final goal the
(historical) super random walk model.

observed at the high silica side. This can be attributed to the more rigid
character of SiO$_2$ and the ability of Ge units to deform. Density functional
theory calculations provide a new assignment of the previously controversial
$^{19}$F MAS NMR resonances for occluded fluoride, which is based not only in
the number of Ge atoms in the double-4-ring units but also on the way they are
associated (namely, no Ge, isolated Ge, Ge pairs or closed Ge clusters). While
we found an overall good agreement between the experimental and theoretical
trends in preferential occupation by Ge of different crystallographic sites,
the theoretical models show more sharp and abrupt tendencies, likely due both
to limitations of the approach and to kinetic factors that allow metastable
configurations to actually exist.

possible surface reconstruction, intrinsic and extrinsic defects are very
difficult to characterise by any method, because of the single-atomic nature of
the crystals involved. Here we present a convergent beam electron holographic
technique which allows imaging of the stacking order in such heterostructures.
Based on the interference of electron waves scattered on different crystals in
the stack, this approach allows one to reconstruct the relative rotation,
stretching, out-of-plane corrugation of the layers with atomic precision. Being
holographic in nature, our approach allows extraction of quantitative
information about the three-dimensional structure of the typical defects from a
single image covering thousands of square nanometres. Furthermore, qualitative
information about the defects in the stack can be extracted from the convergent
diffraction patterns even without reconstruction - simply by comparing the
patterns in different diffraction spots. We expect that convergent beam
electron holography will be widely used to study the properties of van der

binary black hole signals, we compare BayesWave's performance to the
theoretical best achievable performance in three key areas: sky localisation
accuracy, signal/noise discrimination, and waveform reconstruction accuracy.
BayesWave is most effective for signals that have very compact time-frequency
representations. For binaries, where the signal time-frequency volume decreases
with mass, we find that BayesWave's performance reaches or approaches
theoretical optimal limits for system masses above approximately 50 M_sun. For
such systems BayesWave is able to localise the source on the sky as well as
templated Bayesian analyses that rely on a precise signal model, and it is
better than timing-only triangulation in all cases. We also show that the
discrimination of signals against glitches and noise closely follow analytical
predictions, and that only a small fraction of signals are discarded as
glitches at a false alarm rate of 1/100 y. Finally, the match between
BayesWave- reconstructed signals and injected signals is broadly consistent
with first-principles estimates of the maximum possible accuracy, peaking at
about 0.95 for high mass systems and decreasing for lower-mass systems. These
results demonstrate the potential of unmodelled signal reconstruction

the kpc-scale radio properties of, hitherto, the largest sample of 11101
optically-selected NLS1s. Using 1.4 GHz FIRST, 1.4 GHz NVSS, 327 MHz WENNS, and
150 MHz TGSS catalogues we find the radio-detection of merely $\sim$ 4.5 per
cent (498/11101) NLS1s, with majority (407/498 $\sim$ 81.7 per cent) of them
being RL-NLS1s. Our study yields the highest number of RL-NLS1s and it can only
be a lower limit. We find that the most of our radio-detected NLS1s are compact
($<$ 30 kpc), exhibit both flat as well as steep radio spectra, and are
distributed across a wide range of 1.4 GHz radio luminosities (10$^{22}$ $-$
10$^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). At the high end of radio luminosity our NLS1s often
tend to show blazar-like properties such as compact radio-size, flat/inverted
radio spectrum, radio variability and polarization. The diagnostic plots based
on the mid-IR colours suggest that the radio emission in NLS1s is mostly
powered by AGN, while nuclear star-formation may have a significant
contribution in NLS1s of low radio luminosities. The radio luminosity versus
radio-size plot infers that the radio-jets in NLS1s are either in the early
evolutionary phase or possibly remain confined within the nuclear region due to
low-power or intermittent AGN activity.

and decay. During one full month this source stalled at $\sim$30\% of its peak
count rate at a constant hardness and intensity. By combining all the data in
this exceptionally-stable hard state, we obtained an aggregate PCA spectrum
(3-45 keV) with 100 million counts, and a corresponding HEXTE spectrum (20-140
keV) with 5.8 million counts. Implementing a version of our reflection code
with a physical model for Comptonization, we obtain tight constraints on
important physical parameters for this system. In particular, the inner
accretion disk is measured very close in, at $R_\mathrm{in}=1.7\pm0.4$ $R_g$.
Assuming $R_\mathrm{in}=R_\mathrm{ISCO}$, we find a relatively high black hole
spin ($a_*=0.92\pm0.06$). Imposing a lamppost geometry, we obtain a low
inclination ($i=35\pm4$ deg), which agrees with the upper limit found in the
radio ($i<49$ deg). However, we note that this model cannot be statistically
distinguished from a non-lamppost model with free emissivity index, for which
the inclination is markedly higher. Additionally, we find a relatively cool
corona ($57-70$ keV), and large iron abundance ($3.3-3.7$ solar). We further
find that properly accounting for Comptonization of the reflection emission
improves the fit significantly and causes an otherwise low reflection fraction
($\sim 0.2-0.3$) to increase by an order of magnitude, in line with geometrical
expectations for a lamppost corona. We compare these results with similar
investigations reported for GX 339-4 in its bright hard state.

nonlinearities arises from a finite sequence of cascaded sparse coding models,
the outputs of which, except for the last element in the cascade, are sparse
and unobservable. That is, intermediate outputs deep in the cascade are sparse,
hence the title of this manuscript. We show here, using techniques from the
dictionary learning literature that, if the measurement matrices in the
cascaded sparse coding model (a) satisfy RIP and (b) all have sparse columns
except for the last, they can be recovered with high probability. We propose
two algorithms for this purpose: one that recovers the matrices in a forward
sequence, and another that recovers them in a backward sequence. The method of
choice in deep learning to solve this problem is by training an auto-encoder.
Our algorithms provide a sound alternative, with theoretical guarantees, as
well upper bounds on sample complexity. The theory shows that the learning
complexity of the forward algorithm depends on the number of hidden units at
the deepest layer and the number of active neurons at that layer (sparsity). In
addition, the theory relates the number of hidden units in successive layers,
thus giving a practical prescription for designing deep ReLU neural networks.
Because it puts fewer restrictions on the architecture, the backward algorithm
requires more data. We demonstrate the deep dictionary learning algorithm via
simulations. Finally, we use a coupon-collection argument to conjecture a lower
bound on sample complexity that gives some insight as to why deep networks
require more data to train than shallow ones.

in the quad. The problem is to partition the given 4k vectors into k quads with
minimum total cost. We analyze a straightforward matching-based algorithm, and
prove that this algorithm is a (3/2)-approximation algorithm for this problem.
We further analyze the performance of this algorithm on a hierarchy of special
cases of the problem, and prove that, in one particular case, the algorithm is
a (5/4)-approximation algorithm. Our analysis is tight in all cases except one.

method in realistic and open deployments. In this work, we introduce a more
realistic and challenging logo detection setting, called Open Logo Detection.
Specifically, this new setting assumes fine-grained labelling only on a small
proportion of logo classes whilst the remaining classes have no labelled
training data to simulate the open deployment. We further create an open logo
detection benchmark, called OpenLogo,to promote the investigation of this new
challenge. OpenLogo contains 27,083 images from 352 logo classes, built by
aggregating/refining 7 existing datasets and establishing an open logo

Adversarial Learning (CAL) approach to synthesising training data with coherent
logo instance appearance against diverse background context for enabling more
effective optimisation of contemporary deep learning detection models.
Experiments show the performance advantage of CAL over existing

two fundamental questions associated with the foundations of statistical

reversibility? (ii) how does the system relax in general to thermal equilibrium
with its environment? The answers to these questions rely on a deep
understanding of nonequilibrium dynamics of systems interacting with their
environments. Decoherence is also a main concern in developing quantum
information technology. In the past two decades, many theoretical and
experimental investigations have devoted to this topic, most of these
investigations take the Markov (memory-less) approximation. These
investigations have provided a partial understanding to several fundamental
issues, such as quantum measurement and the quantum-to-classical transition,
etc. However, experimental implementations of nanoscale solid-state quantum
information processing makes strong non-Markovian memory effects unavoidable,
thus rendering their study a pressing and vital issue. Through the rigorous
derivation of the exact master equation and a systematical exploration of
various non-Markovian processes for a large class of open quantum systems, we
find that decoherence manifests unexpected complexities. We demonstrate these

networks, has recently been reinterpreted as a specific type of approximate
inference algorithm for Bayesian neural networks. The main contribution of the
reinterpretation is in providing a theoretical framework useful for analysing
and extending the algorithm. We show that the proposed framework suffers from
several issues; from undefined or pathological behaviour of the true posterior
related to use of improper priors, to an ill-defined variational objective due
to singularity of the approximating distribution relative to the true
posterior. Our analysis of the improper log uniform prior used in variational
Gaussian dropout suggests the pathologies are generally irredeemable, and that
the algorithm still works only because the variational formulation annuls some
of the pathologies. To address the singularity issue, we proffer Quasi-KL (QKL)
divergence, a new approximate inference objective for approximation of
high-dimensional distributions. We show that motivations for variational
Bernoulli dropout based on discretisation and noise have QKL as a limit.
Properties of QKL are studied both theoretically and on a simple practical
example which shows that the QKL-optimal approximation of a full rank Gaussian
with a degenerate one naturally leads to the Principal Component Analysis
solution.

developing platform independent code that runs on a variety of parallel
computer architectures ranging from laptop CPUs to multi-GPU distributed memory
systems. Feltor consists of both a numerical library and a collection of
application codes built on top of the library. Its main target are two- and
three-dimensional drift- and gyro-fluid simulations with discontinuous Galerkin
methods as the main numerical discretization technique. We observe that
numerical simulations of a recently developed gyro-fluid model produce
non-deterministic results in parallel computations. First, we show how we
restore accuracy and bitwise reproducibility algorithmically and
programmatically. In particular, we adopt an implementation of the exactly
rounded dot product based on long accumulators, which avoids accuracy losses
especially in parallel applications. However, reproducibility and accuracy
alone fail to indicate correct simulation behaviour. In fact, in the physical
model slightly different initial conditions lead to vastly different end
states. This behaviour translates to its numerical representation. Pointwise
convergence, even in principle, becomes impossible for long simulation times.
In a second part, we explore important performance tuning considerations. We
identify latency and memory bandwidth as the main performance indicators of our
routines. Based on these, we propose a parallel performance model that predicts
the execution time of algorithms implemented in Feltor and test our model on a
selection of parallel hardware architectures. We are able to predict the
execution time with a relative error of less than 25% for problem sizes between
0.1 and 1000 MB. Finally, we find that the product of latency and bandwidth
gives a minimum array size per compute node to achieve a scaling efficiency
above 50% (both strong and weak).

surface currents, is studied on subseasonal timescales. Hovm{\""o}ller and
wavenumber-frequency diagrams with power spectra confirm the multiscale nature
of the flow. Advection of bands immediately brings out the chaotic nature of
mixing in the Bay via repeated straining and filamentation of the tracer field.
A principal finding is that mixing is local, i.e., of the scale of the eddies,
and does not span the entire basin. Indeed, Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent
(FTLE), Relative Dispersion (RD) and Finite Size Lyapunov Exponents (FSLE) maps
in all seasons are patchy with minima scattered through the interior of the
Bay. Non-uniform stirring of the Bay is reflected in long tailed histograms of
FTLEs, that become more stretched for longer time intervals. Quantitatively,
advection for a week shows the mean FTLE lies near 0.15-0.16 $day^{-1}$, while
extremes reach almost 0.5 $day^{-1}$. Averaged over the Bay, RD initially grows
exponentially, this is followed by a power-law at scales between approximately
100 and 250 $km$, which finally transitions to an eddy-diffusive regime. These
findings are confirmed by FSLEs; in addition, below 250 $km$, a scale dependent
diffusion coefficient is extracted, while above 250 $km$, eddy-diffusivities
range from $6 \times 10^3$ - $10^4$ $m^2/s$. Finally, with satellite salinity
data, these Lagrangian tools are used in the analysis a single post-monsoonal

transport barriers, and elucidate how eddies help preserve the identity of
fresh water.

we know that some participants learned the programming basics within our
course, we lack information on whether this knowledge was applied and fortified
after the course's end. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a survey in
2018 among all participants of our 2015 and 2017 programming MOOCs. The first
part of the survey elicits responses on whether and how MOOC knowledge was
applied and gives participants opportunity to voice individual feedback. The
second part of the survey contains several questions of increasing difficulty
and complexity regarding course content in order to learn about the
consolidation of the acquired knowledge. We distinguish three programming
knowledge areas in the survey: First, understanding of concepts, such as loops
and boolean algebra. Second, syntax knowledge, such as specific keywords.
Third, practical skills including debugging and coding. We further analyzed the
long-term effects separately per participant skill group. While answer rates
were low, the collected data shows a decrease of knowledge over time,
relatively unaffected by skill level. Application of the acquired knowledge
improves the memory retention rates of MOOC participants across all skill

violating Maxwell's mechanical stability criterion. In this work, we propose a
general theory of hypostatic amorphous packings and the associated jamming

particles. We show by using a marginal stability argument that in both cases
jammed packings are hypostatic, and that the critical exponents related to the
contact number and the vibrational density of states are the same. Furthermore,
we introduce a generalized perceptron model which can be solved analytically by
the replica method. The analytical solution predicts critical exponents in the
same hypostatic jamming universality class. Our analysis further reveals that
the force and gap distributions of hypostatic jamming do not show power-law
behavior, in marked contrast to the isostatic jamming of spherical particles.

metallicity diagnostic methods, mass-metallicity relation of galaxy,
metallicity gradient in quasar host galaxies, BH mass estimation, the effect of
different spectral energy distribution (SED) models, and a few other potential

  cities","10 pages",,,,"cs.CR cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is increased interest in smart vehicles acting as both data consumers
and producers in smart cities. Vehicles can use smart city data for
decision-making, such as dynamic routing based on traffic conditions. Moreover,
the multitude of embedded sensors in vehicles can collectively produce a rich
data set of the urban landscape that can be used to provide a range of
services. Key to the success of this vision is a scalable and private
architecture for trusted data sharing. This paper proposes a framework called
SpeedyChain, that leverages blockchain technology to allow smart vehicles to
share their data while maintaining privacy, integrity, resilience and
non-repudiation in a decentralized, and tamper-resistant manner. Differently
from traditional blockchain usage (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), the proposed
framework uses a blockchain design that decouples the data stored in the
transactions from the block header, thus allowing for fast addition of data to
the blocks. Furthermore, an expiration time for each block to avoid large sized
blocks is proposed. This paper also presents an evaluation of the proposed
framework in a network emulator to demonstrate its benefits.

is an Intermediate Polar, to characterise its X-ray spectrum and flux, and to
refine its orbital ephemeris and spin period. Methods: We performed
spectrographic observations of V902 Mon in 2016 with the 2.2m Calar Alto
telescope, and X-ray photometry and spectroscopy with XMM-Newton in October
2017. This data was supplemented by several years of AAVSO visual photometry.
Results: We have confirmed V902 Mon as an IP based on detecting the spin
period, with a value of 2,208s, at multiple epochs. Spectroscopy of the donor
star and Gaia parallax yield a distance of 3.5+1.3-0.9, kpc, suggesting an
X-ray luminosity one or two orders of magnitude lower than the 10^33 erg/s
typical of previously known IPs. The X-ray to optical flux ratio is also very
low. The inclination of the system is more than 79deg, with a most likely value
of around 82deg. We have refined the eclipse ephemeris, stable over 14,000
cycles. The Halpha line is present throughout the orbital cycle and is clearly
present during eclipse, suggesting an origin distant from the white dwarf, and
shows radial velocity variations at the orbital period. The amplitude and
overall recessional velocity seem inconsistent with an origin in the disc. The
\emph{XMM-Newton} observation reveals a partially absorbed plasma model typical
of magnetic CVs, with a fluorescent iron line at 6.4keV showing a large
equivalent width of 1.4keV. Conclusions: V902 Mon is an IP, and probably a
member of the hypothesized X-ray underluminous class of IPs. It is likely to be
a disc accretor, though the radial velocity behaviour of the Halpha line
remains puzzling. The large equivalent width of the fluorescent iron line, the
small FX/Fopt ratio, and the only marginal detection of X-ray eclipses suggests
that the X-ray emission arises from scattering.

More precisely, we provide criteria to decide: (a) if a given flat ring

(b) when such universal localisations are classical rings of fractions. In
order to find such criteria, we use the theory of support and we analyse the
specialisation closed subset associated to a flat ring epimorphism. In case the
underlying ring is locally factorial or of Krull dimension one, we show that
all flat ring epimorphisms are universal localisations. Moreover, it turns out
that an answer to the question of when universal localisations are classical
depends on the structure of the Picard group. We furthermore discuss the case
of normal rings, for which the divisor class group plays an essential role to
decide if a given flat ring epimorphism is a universal localisation. Finally,
we explore several (counter)examples which highlight the necessity of our
assumptions.

also for electromagnetic waves, cold atoms, acoustics, and even mechanics.
Their potential applications range from spintronics and quantum computing to
highly efficient lasers. Traditionally, the underlying model of these systems
is a spatial lattice in two or three dimensions. However, it recently became
clear that many lattice systems can exist also in synthetic dimensions which
are not spatial but extend over a different degree of freedom. Thus far,
topological insulators in synthetic dimensions were demonstrated only in cold
atoms, where synthetic dimensions have now become a useful tool for
demonstrating a variety of lattice models that are not available in spatial
lattices. Subsequently, efforts have been directed towards realizing
topological lattices with synthetic dimensions in photonics, where they are
connected to physical phenomena in high-dimensions, interacting photons, and
more. Here we demonstrate experimentally the first photonic topological
insulator in synthetic dimensions. The ability to study experimentally photonic
systems in synthetic dimensions opens the door for a plethora of unexplored
physical phenomena ranging from PT-symmetry, exceptional points and
unidirectional invisibility to Anderson localization in high dimensions and
high-dimensional lattice solitons, topological insulator lasers in synthetic

Modern crowd counting methods employ deep neural networks to estimate crowd

the perspective distortion, which results in drastic person scale change in an

this work, we propose a perspective-aware convolutional neural network (PACNN)
for efficient crowd counting, which integrates the perspective information into
density regression to provide additional knowledge of the person scale change

PACNN is then specifically designed to predict multi-scale perspective maps,
and encode them as perspective-aware weighting layers in the network to
adaptively combine the outputs of multi-scale density maps. The weights are
learned at every pixel of the maps such that the final density combination is
robust to the perspective distortion. We conduct extensive experiments on the
ShanghaiTech, WorldExpo'10, UCF_CC_50, and UCSD datasets, and demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of PACNN over the state-of-the-art.

applications in wireless networks leading to attractive business opportunities.
In the case of abrupt disruption to existing cellular network operation or
infrastructure, e.g., due to an unexpected surge in user demand or a natural
disaster, UAVs can be deployed to provide instant recovery via temporary
wireless coverage in designated areas. A major challenge is to determine
efficiently how many UAVs are needed and where to position them in a relatively
large 3D search space. To this end, we formulate the problem of 3D deployment
of a fleet of UAVs as a mixed integer linear program, and present a greedy
approach that mimics the optimal behavior assuming a grid composed of a finite
set of possible UAV locations. In addition, we propose and evaluate a novel low
complexity algorithm for multiple UAV deployment in a continuous 3D space,
based on an unsupervised learning technique that relies on the notion of
electrostatics with repulsion and attraction forces. We present performance
results for the proposed algorithm as a function of various system parameters
and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to the close-to-optimal greedy
approach and its superiority compared to recent related work from the
literature.

defect segmentation on image data. Most commonly, this task is performed by
thresholding a pixel-wise reconstruction error based on an $\ell^p$ distance.
This procedure, however, leads to large residuals whenever the reconstruction
encompasses slight localization inaccuracies around edges. It also fails to
reveal defective regions that have been visually altered when intensity values
stay roughly consistent. We show that these problems prevent these approaches
from being applied to complex real-world scenarios and that it cannot be easily
avoided by employing more elaborate architectures such as variational or
feature matching autoencoders. We propose to use a perceptual loss function
based on structural similarity which examines inter-dependencies between local
image regions, taking into account luminance, contrast and structural
information, instead of simply comparing single pixel values. It achieves
significant performance gains on a challenging real-world dataset of
nanofibrous materials and a novel dataset of two woven fabrics over the state
of the art approaches for unsupervised defect segmentation that use pixel-wise
reconstruction error metrics.

present in the standard cumulant method is suppressed using a method of
subevent cumulants involving two, three and four subevents separated in

correlations are found to depend strongly on the event multiplicity, the choice
of transverse momentum range and collision system. The relative correlation
strength, obtained by normalisation of the cumulants with the $\langle

collision systems and depends weakly on the event multiplicity and transverse

""synchronize"") explicitly in terms of the dynamics of the driving processes,
the current distribution of the particles' values, and the topology of the

use such systems to describe a dynamic credit-network game and show that, in
equilibrium, the system regularizes: i.e., the times of fragility never occur,
as the particles avoid them by adjusting their connections strategically. Two
auxiliary mathematical results, useful in their own right, are uncovered during
our investigation: a generalization of Schauder's fixed-point theorem for the
Skorokhod space with the M1 topology, and the application of the max-plus

role of interstitial solute atoms (such as carbon and nitrogen) interacting
with mobile dislocations, and this gives rise to the Portevin-Le Chatelier
effect and the formation of Luders bands. In this work, we use in-situ tensile
testing and observation with High Angular Resolution Electron Back Scatter
Diffraction (HR-EBSD) to explore deformation patterning in two Interstitial
Free (IF) steel samples. One of these steels was heat treated to trigger strain
localisation and Luders bands whilst the other was heat treated to homogenise
plastic strain and limit flow localisation. Our work reveals that flow
localisation at the macroscopic scale is closely correlated with differences in
the storage of dislocations at the microscale through analysis of the HR-EBSD
derived fields of stored Geometrically Necessary Dislocations (GNDs).
Homogeneous plastic flow correlates with more 'Face Centred Cubic (FCC)-like'
deformation patterning in these Body Centred Cubic (BCC) materials, where work
hardening is correlated with the association of dislocation networks which
interact with triple junctions and grain boundaries, and our in-situ tests
enable us to see how these fields develop. Our findings enable the modification
of steel processing routes, and micromechanical models, based upon information

translation process, the compiler aims to come close to the Pareto-optimal
front between the number of required qubits and the depth of the resulting

and multiplication which we find using two vastly different approaches. The
first approach is to automatically generate circuits from classical Verilog
implementations using synthesis tools and the second is to generate and
optimize these circuits by hand. We compare our two approaches and provide
evidence that floating-point arithmetic is a viable candidate for use in
quantum computing, at least for typical scientific applications, where addition

structures. Traditional quasi-static experimental methods control the
displacement or force at one or more load-introduction points on a structure.
This approach is unable to traverse limit points in the control parameter, as
the immediate equilibrium beyond these points is statically unstable, causing
the structure to snap to another equilibrium. As a result, unstable
equilibria---observed numerically---are yet to be verified experimentally.
Based on previous experimental work, and a virtual testing environment
developed herein, we propose a new experimental continuation method that can
path-follow along unstable equilibria and traverse limit points. To support
these developments, we provide insightful analogies between a fundamental
building block of our technique---shape control---and analysis concepts such as
the principle of virtual work and Galerkin's method. The proposed testing
method will enable the validation of an emerging class of nonlinear structures
that exploit instabilities for novel functionality.

resulting from optimizing the feedback unitaries on ensemble averaged states

equation which determines the speed of the profile. We find a simple analytic

Connes on the Hopf algebra structure of Feynman graphs and renormalization to
general graphs. Additionally, an algebraic structure of the asymptotics of
formal power series with factorial growth, which is compatible with the Hopf
algebraic structure, is introduced.
  The Hopf algebraic structure on graphs permits the explicit enumeration of
graphs with constraints for the allowed subgraphs. In the case of Feynman
diagrams a lattice structure, which will be introduced, exposes additional
unique properties for physical quantum field theories. The differential ring of
factorially divergent power series allows the extraction of asymptotic results
of implicitly defined power series with vanishing radius of convergence.
Together both structures provide an algebraic formulation of large graphs with
constraints on the allowed subgraphs. These structures are motivated by and
used to analyze renormalized zero-dimensional quantum field theory at high
orders in perturbation theory.
  As a pure application of the Hopf algebra structure, an Hopf algebraic
interpretation of the Legendre transformation in quantum field theory is given.
The differential ring of factorially divergent power series will be used to
solve two asymptotic counting problems from combinatorics: The asymptotic
number of connected chord diagrams and the number of simple permutations. For
both asymptotic solutions, all order asymptotic expansions are provided as
generating functions in closed form. Both structures are combined in an
application to zero-dimensional quantum field theory. Various quantities are
explicitly given asymptotically in the zero-dimensional version of $\varphi^3$,
$\varphi^4$, QED, quenched QED and Yukawa theory with their all order

optics setup naturally leads to focusing and the formation of caustics, which
are singularities in the density of trajectories. We construct a semiclassical
approximation for the wavefunction in all points, placing particular emphasis
on the region near the caustic, where the maximum of the intensity lies.
Because of the matrix character of the Dirac equation, this wavefunction
contains a nontrivial semiclassical phase, which is absent for a scalar wave
equation and which influences the focusing. We carefully discuss the three
steps in our semiclassical approach: the adiabatic reduction of the matrix
equation to an effective scalar equation, the construction of the wavefunction
using the Maslov canonical operator and the application of the uniform
approximation to the integral expression for the wavefunction in the vicinity

in laboratories, elsewhere in the Solar Sytem, and in pulsar binaries.
Nevertheless it is known to be incompatible with quantum mechanics and must
differ from the true behaviour of matter in strong fields and at small spatial
scales. A key aspect of general relativity to test is the strong equivalence
principle (SEP), which states that all freely falling objects, regardless of
how strong their gravity, experience the same acceleration in the same
gravitational field. Essentially all alternatives to general relativity violate
this principle at some level. Previous direct tests of the SEP are limited by
the weak gravity of the bodies in the Earth-Moon-Sun system or by the weak
gravitational pull of the Galaxy on pulsar-white dwarf binaries. PSR~J0337+1715
is a hierarchical stellar triple system, where the inner binary consists of a
millisecond radio pulsar in a $1.6$-day orbit with a white dwarf. This inner
binary is in a $327$-day orbit with another white dwarf. In this system, the
pulsar and the inner companion fall toward the outer companion with an
acceleration about $10^8$ times greater than that produced by falling in the
Galactic potential, and the pulsar's gravitational binding energy is roughly
$10\%$ of its mass. Here we report that in spite of the pulsar's strong
gravity, the accelerations experienced by it and the inner white dwarf differ
by a fraction of no more than $2.6\times 10^{-6}$ ($95\%$ confidence level). We
can roughly compare this to other SEP tests by using the strong-field Nordtvedt
parameter $\hat\eta_N$. Our limit on $\hat\eta_N$ is a factor of ten smaller
than that obtained from (weak-field) Solar-System SEP tests and a factor of
almost a thousand smaller than that obtained from other strong-field SEP tests.

high-pressure high-temperature laboratory experiments ($P$ = 1$-$2 GPa, $T$ =
1523$-$1823 K) on carbon-enriched chemical mixtures to investigate the deep
interiors of Pluto- to Mars-size planets the upper mantles of larger planets.
  Our results show that these exoplanets, when fully-differentiated, comprise a
metallic core, a silicate mantle and a graphite layer on top of the silicate
mantle. The silicate mineralogy (olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and
spinel) is largely unaffected by the amount of carbon. Metals are either two
immiscible iron-rich alloys (S-rich and S-poor) or a single iron-rich alloy in
the Fe-C-S system with immiscibility depending on the S/Fe ratio and core
pressure. Graphite is the dominant carbon-bearing phase at the conditions of
our experiments with no traces of silicon carbide or carbonates. If the bulk
carbon content is higher than needed to saturate the mantle and the core,
graphite would be in the form of an additional layer on top of the silicate
mantle assuming differentiation. For a thick enough graphite layer, diamonds
would form at the bottom of this layer due to high pressures.
  We model the interior structure of Kepler-37b and show that a mere 10 wt%
graphite layer would decrease its derived mass by 7%, suggesting future space
missions that determine both radius and mass of rocky exoplanets with
insignificant gaseous envelopes could provide quantitative limits on their
carbon content. Future observations of rocky exoplanets with graphite-rich
surfaces would show low albedos due to the low reflectance of graphite. The
absence of life-bearing elements other than carbon on the surface likely makes
them uninhabitable.

that FSR1716 may be losing stars due to the gravitational interaction with the

direction method of multipliers (ADMM) have been proposed for solving the

the augmented Lagrangian function is not necessarily to be minimized with
respect to the block-variable corresponding to the quadratic term of the

phenomena by interpreting this modified 3-block ADMM as a realization of a

extend this modified 3-block ADMM to a generalized 3-block ADMM, which not only
applies to the more general convex composite quadratic programming setting but
also admits the potential of achieving even a better numerical performance.

disagreements in $b\to u \tau\nu$ and $b\to d\mu^+\mu^-$ observables. While not
significant on their own, they point in the same direction. Furthermore,
$V_{us}$ extracted from $\tau$ decays shows a slight tension
($\approx2.5\,\sigma$) with its value determined from CKM unitarity.
Additionally, BELLE found hints for an excess in $B_d\to\tau^+\tau^-$.
Concerning NP explanations, the vector leptoquark $SU(2)$ singlet is of special
interest since it is the only single particle extension of the SM which can (in
principle) address all the anomalies described above. For this purpose, large
couplings to $\tau$ leptons are necessary and loop effects, which we calculate
in this article, become important. Including them in our phenomenological
analysis, we find that neither the tension in $V_{us}$ nor the excess in
$B_d\to\tau^+\tau^-$ can be fully explained without violating bounds from
$K\to\pi\nu\bar\nu$. However, one can account for $b\to c\tau\nu$ and $b\to
u\tau\nu$ data finding intriguing correlations with $B_{q}\to\tau^+\tau^-$ and
$K\to \pi\nu\bar\nu$. Furthermore, the explanation of $b\to c\tau\nu$ predicts
a positive shift in $C_7$ and a negative one in $C_9$, being nicely in
agreement with the global fit to $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ data. Finally, we point

We use images extracted from a video, in which a camera takes a tour around a

model is trained, each real frame has a corresponding representation point on
manifold in the latent space, and each representation point has corresponding
reconstructed image. For the navigation problem, we map the starting image and
destination image to the latent space, then optimize a path on the learned
manifold connecting the two points, and finally map the path back through
decoder to a sequence of images. The ideal sequence of images should correspond
to a route that is spatially continuous - i.e. neighbor images in the route
should correspond to neighbor locations in physical space. Such a route could
be used for navigation with computer vision techniques, i.e. a robot could
follow the image sequence from starting location to destination in the
environment step by step. We implement this algorithm, but find in our
experimental results that the resulting route is not satisfactory. The route
consist of several discontinuous image frames along the ideal routes, so that
the route could not be followed by a robot with computer vision techniques in
practice. In our evaluation, we propose two reasons for our failure to
automatically find continuous routes: (1) The VAE tends to capture global
structures, but discard the details; (2) the Euclidean similarity metric used
for measuring continuity between house images is sub-optimal. For further work,
we propose: trying other generative models like VAE-GANs which may be better at
reconstructing the details to learn the representation map, and adjusting the

employ large-scale vehicle sharing, i.e., one vehicle can be used by several
people during one day and consequently the fleet size and the parking space
requirements can be reduced, but, at the cost of a non-negligible increase in
vehicles miles driven in the system. The miles driven in the system can be
reduced by ridesharing, where several people traveling in a similar direction

independent set problem (MIS). The constructed hard instances form an infinite
graph sequence with increasing size, which possesses similar characteristics to
sparse random graphs and in which MIS cannot be solved efficiently. We
analytically and numerically show that all algorithms employing cycle-chain
refutation, which is a general refutation method we introduce for capturing the
ability of many known algorithms, cannot upper bound the size of the maximum
independent set tightly.

particles is proposed. It has been proven that, at high-energy conditions, the
fermion field described by Dirac Lagrangian interacts with the half-integer
spin tachyon field with negative energy, causing the formation of composite
particles whose mass depends on the total angular momentum. The proposed theory
is based on a new interpretation of the Majorana equation for particles with
arbitrary spin and shows that mass oscillation is a phenomenon in which the
component of particle decay prevails over that of mixing mass states. Using the
kinematic of Lemke for spacelike particle decay, we propose a mechanism able to
explain the neutrino flavour change. The proposed mechanism is also
investigated concerning the shape of its spectrum. Finally, the Lagrangian
field of composite particles is formulated.

cylinder filled in with a dense nonscattering semitransparent medium from
directional intensity data by solving the inverse radiative transfer equation.
This equation is solved in a first approach with the help of a discrete scheme,
and the solution is then exactly obtained by separating the physical set on two
disjoint domains on. which a Laplace transform is applied, followed by the
resolution of a first kind Fredholm equation

has been effectively used for the construction and analysis of large systems

specification of BIP models is done in a purely textual manner without any code
editor support. To facilitate the specification of BIP models, we present
DesignBIP, a web-based, collaborative, version-controlled design studio. To
promote model scaling and reusability of BIP models, we use a graphical
language for modeling parameterized BIP models with rigorous semantics. We
present the various services provided by the design studio, including model
editors, code editors, consistency checking mechanisms, code generators, and
integration with the JavaBIP tool-set.
