  (ApJ)",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab108f",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a detailed morphological study of TeV gamma rays, synchrotron
radiation, and interstellar gas in the young Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR)
RCW 86. We find that the interstellar atomic gas shows good spatial correlation
with the gamma rays, indicating that the TeV gamma rays from RCW 86 are likely
to be dominantly of hadronic origin. In contrast, the spatial correlation
between the interstellar molecular cloud and the TeV gamma rays is poor in the
southeastern shell of the SNR. We argue that this poor correlation can be
attributed to the low-energy cosmic rays (~ 1 TeV) not penetrating into the
dense molecular cloud due to an enhancement of the turbulent magnetic field
around the dense cloud of ~ 10-100 $\mu$G. We also find that the southwestern
shell, which is bright in both synchrotron X-ray and radio continuum radiation,
shows a significant gamma-ray excess compared with the interstellar proton
column density, suggesting that leptonic gamma rays via inverse Compton
scattering possibly contributes along with hadronic gamma rays. The total
cosmic-ray energies of the young TeV gamma-ray SNRs$-$RX J1713.7$-$3946, Vela
Jr, HESS J1731$-$347, and RCW 86$-$are roughly similar, which indicates that
cosmic rays can be accelerated in both the core-collapse and Type Ia
supernovae. The total energy of cosmic rays derived using the gas density, ~
10$^{48}$-10$^{49}$ erg, gives a safe lower limit due mainly to the low filling
factor of interstellar gas within the shell.

distinguish the registration-predicted displacement fields from the motion data
simulated by finite element analysis. During training, the registration network
simultaneously aims to maximize similarity between anatomical labels that
drives image alignment and to minimize an adversarial generator loss that
measures divergence between the predicted- and simulated deformation. The
end-to-end trained network enables efficient and fully-automated registration
that only requires an MR and TRUS image pair as input, without anatomical
labels or simulated data during inference. 108 pairs of labelled MR and TRUS
images from 76 prostate cancer patients and 71,500 nonlinear finite-element
simulations from 143 different patients were used for this study. We show that,
with only gland segmentation as training labels, the proposed method can help
predict physically plausible deformation without any other smoothness penalty.
Based on cross-validation experiments using 834 pairs of independent validation
landmarks, the proposed adversarial-regularized registration achieved a target

finite, but large, population is studied. The progress of the epidemic can be
divided into three different phases that requires different tools to analyse.
Initially the process is approximated by a branching process. It is discussed
for how long time this approximation is valid. When a non-negligible proportion
of the population is already infected the process can be studied using
differential equations. In a final phase the spread will fade out. The results
are used to investigate what happens if two strains of infectious agents, with
different potential for spread, are simultaneously introduced in a totally
susceptible population. It is assumed that an infection causes immunity, and
that a person can only be infected by one strain. The two epidemics will
initially develop approximately as independent branching processes. However, if
both strains causes large epidemics they will, due to immunity, eventually
interact. We will mainly be interested in the final outcome of the spread,
i.e., how large proportion of the population is infected by the different
strains.

in evolutionary theory. Inclusive fitness can be used to calculate selection on
a focal gene, but it is also applied to whole organisms. Individuals are then
predicted to appear designed as if to maximise their inclusive fitness,
provided that certain conditions are met (formally when interactions between
individuals are 'additive'). Here we argue that applying the concept of
inclusive fitness to organisms is justified under far broader conditions than
previously shown, but only if it is appropriately defined. Specifically, we
propose that organisms should maximise the sum of their offspring (including
any accrued due to the behaviour/phenotype of relatives), plus any effects on
their relatives' offspring production, weighted by relatedness. In contrast,
most theoreticians have argued that a focal individual's inclusive fitness
should exclude any offspring accrued due to the behaviour of relatives. Our
approach is based on the notion that long-term evolution follows the genome's
'majority interest' of building coherent bodies that are efficient 'vehicles'
for gene propagation. A gene favoured by selection that reduces the propagation
of unlinked genes at other loci (e.g. meiotic segregation distorters that lower
sperm production) is eventually neutralised by counter-selection throughout the
rest of the genome. Most phenotypes will therefore appear as if designed to
maximise the propagation of any given gene in a focal individual and its
relatives.

product operations, which are the component that require the highest
computational resources. A common approach to reduce the cost of inference is
to reduce its memory complexity by lowering the entropy of the weight matrices
of the neural network, e.g., by pruning and quantizing their elements. However,
the quantized weight matrices are then usually represented either by a dense or
sparse matrix storage format, whose associated dot product complexity is not
bounded by the entropy of the matrix. This means that the associated inference
complexity ultimately depends on the implicit statistical assumptions that
these matrix representations make about the weight distribution, which can be
in many cases suboptimal. In this paper we address this issue and present new
efficient representations for matrices with low entropy statistics. These new
matrix formats have the novel property that their memory and algorithmic
complexity are implicitly bounded by the entropy of the matrix, consequently
implying that they are guaranteed to become more efficient as the entropy of
the matrix is being reduced. In our experiments we show that performing the dot
product under these new matrix formats can indeed be more energy and time
efficient under practically relevant assumptions. For instance, we are able to
attain up to x42 compression ratios, x5 speed ups and x90 energy savings when
we convert in a lossless manner the weight matrices of state-of-the-art
networks such as AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet152 and DenseNet into the new matrix
formats and benchmark their respective dot product operation.

Normalization can provably accelerate optimization. We argue that this
acceleration is due to the fact that Batch Normalization splits the
optimization task into optimizing length and direction of the parameters
separately. This allows gradient-based methods to leverage a favourable global
structure in the loss landscape that we prove to exist in Learning Halfspace

Batch Normalization from an effective practical heuristic into a provably

memoryless channel $W$ is addressed. The ""product-space"" improvement of the
random coding lower bound on the mismatch capacity, $C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$, was
introduced by Csisz\'ar and Narayan.
  We study two kinds of decoders. The {\it $\delta$-margin mismatched decoder}
outputs a message whose metric with the channel output exceeds that of all the
other codewords by at least $\delta$. The {\it $\tau$-threshold decoder}
outputs a single message whose metric with the channel output exceeds a
threshold $\tau$. Both decoders declare an error if they fail to find a message
that meets the requirement. It is assumed that $q$ is bounded.
  It is proved that $C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$ is equal to the mismatch capacity with
a constant margin decoder. We next consider sequences of $P$-constant
composition codebooks, whose empirical distribution of the codewords are at
least $o(n^{-1/2})$ close in the $L_1$ distance sense to $P$. Using the Central
Limit Theorem, it is shown that for such sequences of codebooks the supremum of
achievable rates with constant threshold decoding is upper bounded by the
supremum of the achievable rates with a constant margin decoder, and therefore
also by $C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$.
  Further, a soft converse is proved stating that if the average probability of
error of a sequence of codebooks converges to zero sufficiently fast, the rate
of the code sequence is upper bounded by $C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$. In particular, if
$q$ is a bounded rational metric, and the average probability of error
converges to zero faster than $O(n^{-1})$, then $R\leq C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$.
Finally, a max-min multi-letter upper bound on the mismatch capacity that bears
some resemblance to $C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$ is presented.

constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits of Majority gates, is a notorious open
problem in complexity theory. A major frontier is to prove that $\textsf{NEXP}$
does not have poly-size $\textsf{THR} \circ \textsf{THR}$ circuit (depth-two
circuits with linear threshold gates).
  In recent years, R.~Williams proposed a program to prove circuit lower bounds
via improved algorithms. In this paper, following Williams' framework, we show
that the above frontier question can be resolved by devising slightly faster
algorithms for several fundamental problems:
  1. Shaving Logs for $\textsf{$\ell_2$-Furthest-Pair}$. An $n^2
\textrm{poly}(d) / \log^{\omega(1)} n$ time algorithm for
$\textsf{$\ell_2$-Furthest-Pair}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for polylogarithmic $d$
implies $\textsf{NEXP}$ has no polynomial size $\textsf{THR} \circ
\textsf{THR}$ circuits. The same holds for Hopcroft's problem,
$\textsf{Bichrom.-$\ell_2$-Closest-Pair}$ and Integer $\textsf{Max-IP}$.
  2. Shaving Logs for Approximate $\textsf{Bichrom.-$\ell_2$-Closest-Pair}$. An
$n^2 \textrm(d) / \log^{\omega(1)} n$ time algorithm for $(1+1/\log^{\omega(1)}
n)$-approximation to $\textsf{Bichrom.-$\ell_2$-Closest-Pair}$ or
$\textsf{Bichrom.-$\ell_1$-Closest-Pair}$ for polylogarithmic $d$ implies
$\textsf{NEXP}$ has no polynomial size $\textsf{SYM}\circ\textsf{THR}$
circuits.
  3. Shaving Logs for Modest Dimension Boolean $\textsf{Max-IP}$. An $n^2 /
\log^{\omega(1)} n$ time algorithm for Bichromatic Maximum Inner Product with
vector dimension $d = n^\epsilon$ for any small constant $\epsilon$ would imply
$\textsf{NEXP}$ has no polynomial size $\textsf{THR} \circ \textsf{THR}$
circuits. Note there is an $n^2\textrm{polylog}(n)$ time algorithm via fast
rectangle matrix multiplication.
  Our results build on two structure lemmas for threshold circuits.

geomagnetic activity, which is critically dependent on the orientation of the
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Most solar wind coupling functions
quantify this dependence on the IMF orientation with the so-called IMF clock
angle in a way, which is symmetric with respect to the sign of the $B_y$
component. However, recent studies have suggested that the sign of $B_y$ is an
additional, independent driver of high-latitude geomagnetic activity, leading
to higher (weaker) geomagnetic activity in Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter for
$B_y\! >\! 0$ ($B_y\! <\! 0$). In this paper we quantify the size of this
explicit $B_y$-effect with respect to the solar wind coupling function, both
for Northern and Southern high-latitude geomagnetic activity. We show that
high-latitude geomagnetic activity is significantly (by about 40-50\%)
suppressed for $B_y\!<\!0$ in NH winter and for $B_y\!>\!0$ in SH winter. When
averaged over all months, high-latitude geomagnetic activity in NH is about
12\% weaker for $B_y\!<\!0$ than for $B_y\!>\!0$. The $B_y$-effect affects the
westward electrojet strongly but hardly at all the eastward electrojet. We also
show that the suppression of the westward electrojet in NH during $B_y\!<\!0$
maximizes when the Earth's dipole axis points towards the night sector, i.e.,
when the auroral region is maximally in darkness.

information available for diagnosis. Yet, excessive scan times associated with
additional contrasts may be a limiting factor. Two mainstream approaches for
enhanced scan efficiency are reconstruction of undersampled acquisitions and
synthesis of missing acquisitions. In reconstruction, performance decreases
towards higher acceleration factors with diminished sampling density
particularly at high-spatial-frequencies. In synthesis, the absence of data
samples from the target contrast can lead to artefactual sensitivity or
insensitivity to image features. Here we propose a new approach for synergistic
reconstruction-synthesis of multi-contrast MRI based on conditional generative
adversarial networks. The proposed method preserves high-frequency details of
the target contrast by relying on the shared high-frequency information
available from the source contrast, and prevents feature leakage or loss by
relying on the undersampled acquisitions of the target contrast. Demonstrations
on brain MRI datasets from healthy subjects and patients indicate the superior
performance of the proposed method compared to previous state-of-the-art. The

Java that brings to the safety-critical industry the possibility of using Java.
SCJ defines three compliance levels: Level 0, Level 1 and Level 2. The SCJ
specification is clear on what constitutes a Level 2 application in terms of
its use of the defined API, but not the occasions on which it should be used.
This paper broadly classifies the features that are only available at Level 2
into three groups:~nested mission sequencers, managed threads, and global
scheduling across multiple processors. We explore the first two groups to
elicit programming requirements that they support. We identify several areas
where the SCJ specification needs modifications to support these requirements
fully; these include:~support for terminating managed threads, the ability to
set a deadline on the transition between missions, and augmentation of the
mission sequencer concept to support composibility of timing constraints. We
also propose simplifications to the termination protocol of missions and their
mission sequencers. To illustrate the benefit of our changes, we present
excerpts from a formal model of SCJ Level~2 written in Circus, a state-rich
process algebra for refinement.

hard task in terms of the expressiveness of the employed similarity measure and

invariant to the order of nodes and the sizes of compared graphs, adaptive to

not been addressed together. Graph comparisons still rely on direct approaches,
graph kernels, or representation-based methods, which are all inefficient and
impractical for large graph collections.
  In this paper, we propose the Network Laplacian Spectral Descriptor (NetLSD):
the first, to our knowledge, permutation- and size-invariant, scale-adaptive,

straightforward comparisons of large graphs. NetLSD extracts a compact
signature that inherits the formal properties of the Laplacian spectrum,

evaluation on a variety of real-world graphs demonstrates that it outperforms
previous works in both expressiveness and efficiency.

derive and can be used to segment and identify interesting observations in very
large data sets based on their morphological complexity. We show, using data
from the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey, that apparent complexity can be
combined with clustering methods to provide an automated process for
distinguishing between images of galaxies which have been classified as having
simple and complex morphologies. The approach generalizes well when applied to
new data after being calibrated on a smaller data set, where it performs better

in the frustrated centrosymmetric triangular-lattice magnet Gd2PdSi3. We
identified the field-induced skyrmion phase via a giant topological Hall

towards non-invasive identification of tumor stage and grade, which is critical

However, the automatic delineation of bladder walls and tumor in magnetic
resonance images (MRI) is a challenging task, due to important bladder shape
variations, strong intensity inhomogeneity in urine and very high variability
across population, particularly on tumors appearance. To tackle these issues,
we propose to use a deep fully convolutional neural network. The proposed
network includes dilated convolutions to increase the receptive field without
incurring extra cost nor degrading its performance. Furthermore, we introduce
progressive dilations in each convolutional block, thereby enabling extensive
receptive fields without the need for large dilation rates. The proposed
network is evaluated on 3.0T T2-weighted MRI scans from 60 pathologically
confirmed patients with BC. Experiments shows the proposed model to achieve
high accuracy, with a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.98, 0.84 and 0.69
for inner wall, outer wall and tumor region, respectively. These results
represent a very good agreement with reference contours and an increase in
performance compared to existing methods. In addition, inference times are less
than a second for a whole 3D volume, which is between 2-3 orders of magnitude
faster than related state-of-the-art methods for this application. We showed
that a CNN can yield precise segmentation of bladder walls and tumors in
bladder cancer patients on MRI. The whole segmentation process is
fully-automatic and yields results in very good agreement with the reference
standard, demonstrating the viability of deep learning models for the automatic
multi-region segmentation of bladder cancer MRI images.

from many-body interaction picture, the polaronic states can be precisely
described by the method of cumulant expansion of retarded Green's function. By
applying Kubo-Greenwood method, we found that the mysterious Seebeck

multi-band nature of t2g orbitals. Polarons are formed from the one with

This is suboptimal as no information about users shared across di erent tasks.
In this work, we propose to learn universal user representations across
multiple tasks for more e ective personalization. In partic- ular, user
behavior sequences (e.g., click, bookmark or purchase of products) are modeled
by LSTM and attention mechanism by integrating all the corresponding content,
behavior and temporal information. User representations are shared and learned

tasks. We refer this work as Deep User Perception Network (DUPN) and conduct an

sets up ill-posed integral equations and uses the (approximate) solutions to
reconstruct the target. In contrast, the kernels of the associated integral
operators are the far field patterns of sound soft balls. The measured data is
moved to right hand sides of the equations, which gives the method the ability
to process limit aperture data. Furthermore, a multilevel technique is employed
to improve the reconstruction. Numerical examples show that the method can
effectively determine the location and approximate the support with little a
priori information of the unknown target.

Doppler shifts of spectral lines formed in the transition region
(C\,II\,1334.5\,{\AA}) and hot coronal plasma (Fe\,XXI\,1354.1\,{\AA}) to
investigate the dynamics of the solar atmosphere during the flare impulsive

X-ray imaging spectroscopy and assuming the standard thick-target model. Using
the RADYN flare models, the RH 1.5D radiative transfer code and the Chianti
atomic line database, we calculate C\,II and Fe\,XXI line profiles and compare
with the observations. While the RADYN models predict a correlation between the
Doppler shifts and deposited energy flux for both lines, this was only observed
in the C II data. Several quantitative discrepancies are found between the
observations and models: the Fe\,XXI Doppler shifts are substantially stronger
in the models than in the data; the C\,II mean blueshifts are absent in the
observations but predicted by the models. The transition energy between
`gentle' and `explosive' evaporation regimes estimated from the observations
($2-8\times{}10^{9}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$) and derived from the models

(CNN) which is capable of tagging the neutralino jet in any signal process by
using the idea of jet image. When applied to pure jet samples, such a CNN
outperforms the N-subjettiness variable by a factor of a few in tagging
efficiency. Moreover, we find the method, which combines the CNN output and jet
invariant mass, can perform better and is applicable to a wider range of
neutralino mass than the CNN alone. Finally, the ATLAS search for the signal of
gluino pair production with subsequent decay $\tilde{g} \to q q
\tilde{\chi}^0_1 (\to q q q)$ is recasted as an application. In contrast to the
pure sample, the heavy contamination among jets in this complex final state
renders the discriminating powers of the CNN and N-subjettiness similar. By
analyzing the jets substructure in events which pass the ATLAS cuts with our
CNN method, the exclusion limit on gluino mass can be pushed up by $\sim200$

open question how seriously to take the analogies between artificial deep
networks and biological neuronal systems. Interestingly, recent work has shown
that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large-scale image
recognition tasks can serve as strikingly good models for predicting the
responses of neurons in visual cortex to visual stimuli, suggesting that
analogies between artificial and biological neural networks may be more than
superficial. However, while CNNs capture key properties of the average
responses of cortical neurons, they fail to explain other properties of these
neurons. For one, CNNs typically require large quantities of labeled input data
for training. Our own brains, in contrast, rarely have access to this kind of
supervision, so to the extent that representations are similar between CNNs and
brains, this similarity must arise via different training paths. In addition,
neurons in visual cortex produce complex time-varying responses even to static
inputs, and they dynamically tune themselves to temporal regularities in the
visual environment. We argue that these differences are clues to fundamental
differences between the computations performed in the brain and in deep
networks. To begin to close the gap, here we study the emergent properties of a
previously-described recurrent generative network that is trained to predict
future video frames in a self-supervised manner. Remarkably, the model is able
to capture a wide variety of seemingly disparate phenomena observed in visual
cortex, ranging from single unit response dynamics to complex perceptual motion
illusions. These results suggest potentially deep connections between recurrent

the system into a strongly disordered phase. In this disordered phase,

instance, an early PTV experiment observed particles moving at the normal fluid
velocity $v_n$, while a PIV experiment observed particles moving at $v_n/2$,
though the range of heat flux applied in these experiments differed by an order
of magnitude. To resolve this apparent discrepancy and explore statistics of
particle motion in thermal counterflow, we have applied PTV to a wide range of
heat flux at several fluid temperatures. We introduce a scheme for analyzing
the velocity of particles presumably moving with the normal fluid separately
from those presumably influenced by the vortex tangle. Our results show two
distinct peaks in the streamwise particle velocity PDF (probability density

transverse velocity fluctuation, backed up by second sound attenuation in

an actively discussed issue. Among various models to explain observations,
synchrotron radiation from the electron population different from radio to IR
emitting electrons is promising. However, the origin of this electron
population has been debated. Recently, we proposed that this electron
population is produced by proton-photon collisions (mainly, Bethe-Heitler
process), and we applied this model to PKS 0637-752. We found that this model
works if the proton power is by an order of magnitude larger than the Eddington
power. In this paper we apply this model to the X-ray emission in the knots of
3C 273 and PKS 1136-135. The target photons for electron-positron pair
production are supplied by synchrotron radiation at radio-IR by primary
electrons and by the active galactic nucleus (AGN) core as well as cosmic
microwave background (CMB) radiation. The effects of the AGN photons are
included for the first time in the hadronic model. Though the observed X-ray
flux is obtained with the contribution of the AGN photons, the required proton
power turns out to be highly super-Eddington. However, we find that our model
works for a nearly Eddington proton power, if the photon density of the AGN is
enhanced. This can occur if the AGN photons are more beamed toward the X-ray
knots than toward our line of sight and the AGN photon frequency is shifted by
the Doppler effect.

As each region is evaluated independently, the number of candidate regions from

we address this issue by training a network to distinguish different objects

regions and measure their similarities. Based on pairwise similarities and
detection qualities, the IDNet selects a subset of candidate bounding boxes

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by theoretically analyzing their
generalization performance and establishing optimization guarantees for
gradient descent based training algorithms. Specifically, for a CNN model
consisting of $l$ convolutional layers and one fully connected layer, we prove
that its generalization error is bounded by
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\dt\widetilde{\varrho}/n})$ where $\theta$ denotes freedom
degree of the network parameters and
$\widetilde{\varrho}=\mathcal{O}(\log(\prod_{i=1}^{l}\rwi{i}
(\ki{i}-\si{i}+1)/p)+\log(\rf))$ encapsulates architecture parameters including
the kernel size $\ki{i}$, stride $\si{i}$, pooling size $p$ and parameter
magnitude $\rwi{i}$. To our best knowledge, this is the first generalization
bound that only depends on $\mathcal{O}(\log(\prod_{i=1}^{l+1}\rwi{i}))$,
tighter than existing ones that all involve an exponential term like
$\mathcal{O}(\prod_{i=1}^{l+1}\rwi{i})$. Besides, we prove that for an
arbitrary gradient descent algorithm, the computed approximate stationary point
by minimizing empirical risk is also an approximate stationary point to the
population risk. This well explains why gradient descent training algorithms
usually perform sufficiently well in practice. Furthermore, we prove the
one-to-one correspondence and convergence guarantees for the non-degenerate
stationary points between the empirical and population risks. It implies that
the computed local minimum for the empirical risk is also close to a local
minimum for the population risk, thus ensuring the good generalization
performance of CNNs.

a machine learning technique that estimates the mastery level of a student
based on his/her past performance. The objective of KT is to predict a
student's response to the next question. Compared with traditional KT models,
deep learning-based KT (DLKT) models show better predictive performance because
of the representation power of deep neural networks. Various methods have been
proposed to improve the performance of DLKT, but few studies have been
conducted on the reliability of DLKT. In this work, we claim that the existing
DLKTs are not reliable in real education environments. To substantiate the
claim, we show limitations of DLKT from various perspectives such as knowledge
state update failure, catastrophic forgetting, and non-interpretability. We
then propose a novel regularization to address these problems. The proposed
method allows us to achieve trustworthy DLKT. In addition, the proposed model
which is trained on scenarios with forgetting can also be easily extended to
scenarios without forgetting.

curvatures $K$ satisfying $K \leq -1$. In \cite{biswas6}, a Fourier transform

Plancherel theorem were proved. We use the Fourier transform to investigate the
dynamics on $L^p(X)$ for $p > 2$ of certain bounded linear operators $T :
L^p(X) \to L^p(X)$ which we call ""$L^p$-multipliers"" in accordance with
standard terminology. These operators are required to preserve the subspace of
$L^p$ radial functions. A notion of convolution with radial functions was
defined in \cite{biswas6}, and these operators are also required to be
compatible with convolution in the sense that $$ T\phi * \psi = \phi * T\psi $$
for all radial $C^{\infty}_c$-functions $\phi, \psi$. They are also required to
be compatible with translation of radial functions. Examples of
$L^p$-multipliers are given by the operator of convolution with an $L^1$ radial
function, or more generally convolution with a finite radial measure. In
particular elements of the heat semigroup $e^{t\Delta}$ act as multipliers.
Given $2 < p < \infty$, we show that for any $L^p$-multiplier $T$ which is not
a scalar multiple of the identity, there is an open set of values of $\nu \in
\mathbb{C}$ for which the operator $\frac{1}{\nu} T$ is chaotic on $L^p(X)$ in
the sense of Devaney, i.e. topologically transitive and with periodic points
dense. Moreover such operators are topologically mixing. We also show that
there is a constant $c_p > 0$ such that for any $c \in \mathbb{C}$ with $\Re c
> c_p$, the action of the shifted heat semigroup $e^{ct} e^{t\Delta}$ on
$L^p(X)$ is chaotic. These results generalize the corresponding results for
rank one symmetric spaces of noncompact type and negatively curved harmonic

prove that the system can never be steered to extinction (steady state $0$) or
invasion (steady state $1$) in finite time, but is asymptotically controllable
to $1$ independently of the size $L$, and to $0$ if the length $L$ of the
interval domain is less than some threshold value $L^\star$, which can be
computed from transcendental integrals. In the bistable case, controlling to
the other homogeneous steady state $0 <\theta< 1$ is much more intricate. We
rely on a staircase control strategy to prove that $\theta$ can be reached in
finite time if and only if $L< L^\star$. The phase plane analysis of those
equations is instrumental in the whole process. It allows us to read obstacles
to controllability, compute the threshold value for domain size as well as
design the path of steady states for the control strategy.

  defect prediction","submitted to ESEM 2018",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Two public defect data, including Jureczko and NASA datasets,
have been widely used in cross project defect prediction (CPDP). The quality of
defect data have been reported as an important factor influencing the defect
prediction performance and Shepperd et al. have researched the data quality
problems in NASA datasets. However, up to now, there is no research focusing on
the quality problems of Jureczko datasets which are most widely used in CPDP.
Aims: In this paper, we intend to investigate the problems of identical and
inconsistent cases in Jureczko datasets and validate whether removing these
problematic cases will make a difference to defect prediction performance in
CPDP. Method: The problems of identical and inconsistent cases are reported
from two aspects, respectively in each individual dataset and in a pair of
datasets from different releases of a software project. Then a cleaned version
of Jureczko datasets is provided by removing duplicate and inconsistent cases.
Finally three training data selection methods are employed to compare the
defect prediction performance of cleaned datasets with that of original
datasets. Results: The experimental results in terms of AUC and F-Measure show
that most datasets obtain very different defect prediction performance.
Conclusions: It is very necessary to study the data quality problems in CPDP
and the cleaned Jureczko datasets may provide more reliable defect prediction
performance in CPDP.

all potential applications of the spin qubit. Here we demonstrate a spin
dephasing mechanism in semiconductor quantum dot due to the $1/f$ charge noise.
The spin-charge interaction is mediated by the interplay between the spin-orbit
coupling and the asymmetrical quantum dot confining potential. The dephasing
rate is proportional to both the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the
degree of the asymmetry of the confining potential. For parameters typical of
the InSb, InAs, and GaAs quantum dots with a moderate well-height $V_{0}=10$

enhanced by lowering the well-height. When the well-height is as small as
$V_{0}=5$ meV, the spin depahsing times in the InSb, InAs, and GaAs quantum

$m=\dim(V_m)$ and computed by a weighted least squares method. Recent results
show the advantages of picking the sampling points at random according to a
well-chosen probability measure $\mu$ that depends both on $V_m$ and $\rho$.
With such a random design, the weighted least squares approximation is proved
to be stable with high probability, and having precision comparable to that of
the exact $L^2(D,\rho)$-orthonormal projection onto $V_m$, in a near-linear
sampling regime $n\sim{m\log m}$. The present paper is motivated by the
adaptive approximation context, in which one typically generates a nested
sequence of spaces $(V_m)_{m\geq1}$ with increasing dimension. Although the
measure $\mu=\mu_m$ changes with $V_m$, it is possible to recycle the
previously generated samples by interpreting $\mu_m$ as a mixture between
$\mu_{m-1}$ and an update measure $\sigma_m$. Based on this observation, we
discuss sequential sampling algorithms that maintain the stability and
approximation properties uniformly over all spaces $V_m$. Our main result is
that the total number of computed sample at step $m$ remains of the order
$m\log{m}$ with high probability. Numerical experiments confirm this analysis.

routing helps capsules achieve more generalization capacity with many fewer
model parameters. However, the bottleneck that prevents widespread applications
of capsule is the expense of computation during routing. To address this
problem, we generalize existing routing methods within the framework of
weighted kernel density estimation, and propose two fast routing methods with
different optimization strategies. Our methods prompt the time efficiency of
routing by nearly 40\% with negligible performance degradation. By stacking a
hybrid of convolutional layers and capsule layers, we construct a network
architecture to handle inputs at a resolution of $64\times{64}$ pixels. The
proposed models achieve a parallel performance with other leading methods in
multiple benchmarks.

supernovae (SNe Ia) works. In the binary star system of a white dwarf (WD) and
its non-degenerate companion star, the WD accretes either H-rich matter or He
and undergoes H and He shell-burning. We summarize how such shell-burning
depend on the accretion rate and the WD mass and how the WD blows strong wind.
We identify the following evolutionary routes for the accreting WD to trigger a
thermonuclear explosion. With a decreasing rate with time, 5 phases are
observed: 1. The WD increases its mass by stable H burning and blows a strong
wind, which strips a part of the companion star's envelope to control the
accretion rate and forms circumstellar matter (CSM). The WD may explode within
CSM as an ""SN Ia-CSM"". 2. The wind stops and an SN Ia is triggered under
steady-stable H shell-burning, which is observed as a super-soft X-ray source:
""SN Ia-SSXS"". 3. H shell-burning becomes unstable and many flashes recur. The
WD undergoes recurrent nova (RN) whose mass ejection is smaller than the
accreted matter, evolving to an ""SN Ia-RN"". 4. If the companion is a He star or
WD, the accretion of He can trigger He and C double detonations at the
sub-Chandrasekhar (sub-Chand) mass or the WD grows to the Chand mass while
producing and He-wind: ""SN Ia-He CSM"". 5. If the accreting WD rotates rapidly,
delayed trigger of an SN Ia beyond standard Chand mass can happen. The
(super-Chand) WD contracts to become a delayed SN Ia after losing angular
momentum. The companion star has become a He WD and CSM has disappeared: ""SN
Ia-He WD"". We update nucleosynthesis yields of the carbon deflagration model
W7, delayed detonation model WDD2, and the sub-Chand mass model to constrain
the yields (such as Mn) by comparing the observations. We note the important
metallicity effects on $^{58}$Ni and $^{55}$Mn.

objects at the highly relevant cm length scales has been lacking and overlooked
due to the complexity of current techniques. Predicting the final-configuration
probability of flipping cars for example remains extremely challenging. In this
paper we introduce new statistical methodologies to solve these challenging
macroscopic problems. Boltzmann's principles in statistical mechanics have been
well recognized for a century for their usefulness in explaining thermodynamic
properties of matter in gas, liquid and solid phases. Studied systems usually
involve a large number of particles at the atomic scales. However, it is
unusual for Boltzmann's principles to be applied to individual objects at
centimeter to human-size length scales. We show that the concept of statistical
mechanics still holds for describing the probability of a tossed dice landing
on a particular face. For regular dice, the one in six probability that the
dice land on each face is well known. In the case of orthorhombic dice, this
symmetry is broken and hence we need new tools to predict the probability of
landing on each face. We propose a new method based on Boltzmann's principles
which uses synthetic temperature term. Surprisingly, this approach requires
only the dimensions of the thrown object for calculating potential energy as
the input, with no other fitting parameters needed. The statistical predictions
for landing fit well to experimental data of over fifty-thousand samplings of
dice in 23 different dimensions. We believe that the ability to predict, in a
simple and tractable manner, the outcomes of macroscopic movement of large
scale probabilistic phenomena opens up a new line of approach for explaining
many phenomena in the critical centimeter length scale.

relations that connect the radius and orbital frequency of the ISCO to the spin
frequency $f$ and mass $M$ of rotating neutron stars. The relations are
EOS-insensitive to about the 2% level for a large range of $Mf$. We also find
that the universal relation for the ISCO radius agrees with the corresponding
relation for the Kerr black hole to within 6% up to $Mf=5000 M_\odot {\rm Hz}$.
Our relations can be applied to accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray
binaries. Using the spin frequency $f=414$ Hz and the highest kilohertz
quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) at 1220 Hz observed in the system 4U

conclusion only makes a minimal assumption that the highest kHz QPO frequency

uncertainty related to the dimensionless spin parameter, which are commonly
required in the literature.

usage, latency, throughput, load average, scalability and explain why the
standardized architecture is not suitable for IoT. We study the performance of
proposed NFV based edge analysis for IoT security and show that attacks can be

complexity of the algorithm limits its application to relatively small

developed in recent years, mainly focusing on the scalability of the similarity

not only beat the state of the art, but can even be executed on the client side

The lack of explanations for the decisions of black box systems is a key

In this paper we focus on the problem of black box outcome explanation, i.e.,
explaining the reasons of the decision taken on a specific instance. We propose
LORE, an agnostic method able to provide interpretable and faithful

of the local interpretable predictor a meaningful explanation consisting of: a
decision rule, which explains the reasons of the decision; and a set of
counterfactual rules, suggesting the changes in the instance's features that
lead to a different outcome. Wide experiments show that LORE outperforms
existing methods and baselines both in the quality of explanations and in the

the void between graphene and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides. Similarly to
other 2D materials, the electronic structure of phosphorene is strongly
influenced by reduced screening, making it challenging to obtain reliable
predictions by single-particle density functional methods. Advanced GW
techniques, which include many-body effects as perturbative corrections, are
hardly consistent with each other, predicting the band gap of phosphorene with
a spread of almost 1 eV, from 1.6 to 2.4 eV. Our QMC results, from infinite
periodic superlattices as well as from finite clusters, predict $\Delta_f$ to
be about 2.4 eV, indicating that available GW results are systematically
underestimating the gap. Using the recently uncovered universal scaling between
the exciton binding energy and $\Delta_f$, we predict the optical gap of 1.75
eV that can be directly related to measurements even on encapsulated samples
due to its robustness against dielectric environment. The QMC gaps are indeed
consistent with recent experiments based on optical absorption and
photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. We also predict the cohesion of
phosphorene to be only slightly smaller than that of the bulk crystal. Our
investigations not only benchmark GW methods and experiments, but also open the
field of 2D electronic structure to computationally intensive but highly

the $\Xi_b(6227)^-$ is a good candidate of the $P$-wave $\Xi_b^{\prime}$ state
with $J^P=3/2^-$ or $5/2^-$. In addition, we further provide the information of
the properties of the partners of the $\Xi_b(6227)^-$. These predicted states
include three $2S$ states and the remaining $1P$ states in the bottom-strange
baryon family. The calculated sizable Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka$-$allowed decay widths
of these partners show that the experimental search for them becomes possible
via LHCb. We have a reason to believe that the present study can be treated as
a start point for constructing the highly excited bottom baryon spectroscopy.

feedback (generally known as telehaptics) has gained widespread interest over
the past decade. Several protocols have been proposed for performing telehaptic
interaction over shared networks. However, a comprehensive analysis of the
impact of network cross-traffic on telehaptic streams, and the feasibility of
Quality of Service (QoS) compliance is lacking in the literature. In this
paper, we seek to fill this gap. Specifically, we explore the QoS experienced
by two classes of telehaptic protocols on shared networks - Constant Bitrate
(CBR) protocols and adaptive sampling based protocols, accounting for CBR as
well as TCP cross-traffic. Our treatment of CBR-based telehaptic protocols is
based on a micro-analysis of the interplay between TCP and CBR flows on a
shared bottleneck link, which is broadly applicable for performance evaluation
of CBR-based media streaming applications. Based on our analytical
characterization of telehaptic QoS, and via extensive simulations and real
network experiments, we formulate a set of sufficient conditions for telehaptic
QoS-compliance. These conditions provide guidelines for designers of telehaptic
protocols, and for network administrators to configure their networks for
guaranteeing QoS-compliant telehaptic communication.

rovibrational transitions in the $\nu_3$ fundamental band of ozone induced by
oxygen (O$_2$), air and the noble gases helium (He), argon (Ar), and xenon (Xe)
are obtained by employing second harmonic detection. The experimental analysis
comprises a full uncertainty budget and provides line shift data which are
traceable to SI. The high density of transitions in the $\nu_3$ spectral region
of ozone make this region particularly difficult to study with more commonly
used techniques such as Fourier transform spectroscopy. The comparatively high
spectral resolution of the QCL in the MHz range, on the contrary, allows to
measure molecular shifts at relatively low pressures (from 2 to 70 hPa), thus
reducing the impact of spectral congestion due to pressure broadening of
molecular lines. The comparison of our results with published data shows that
presently recommended values for the pressure shift are too low in this region.
This observation is corroborated by semi-classical calculations using the
Robert-Bonamy formalism. A slight negative $J$ dependence, already observed in
other ozone vibrational bands, is predicted. Systematic use of our technique
could be very useful to support this hypothesis and to make up for the lack of
shift parameters for ozone $\nu_3$ transitions in molecular spectral databases.
A subsequent stabilization of the QCL onto an optical frequency comb will open
up possibilities to perform metrological measurements of Doppler-free molecular
lines.

data is still in need of better modelling. Truncated backpropagation through
time (TBPTT), the learning algorithm most widely used in practice, suffers from
the truncation bias, which drastically limits its ability to learn long-term
dependencies.The Real-Time Recurrent Learning algorithm (RTRL) addresses this
issue, but its high computational requirements make it infeasible in practice.
The Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization algorithm (UORO) approximates RTRL
with a smaller runtime and memory cost, but with the disadvantage of obtaining
noisy gradients that also limit its practical applicability. In this paper we
propose the Kronecker Factored RTRL (KF-RTRL) algorithm that uses a Kronecker
product decomposition to approximate the gradients for a large class of RNNs.
We show that KF-RTRL is an unbiased and memory efficient online learning
algorithm. Our theoretical analysis shows that, under reasonable assumptions,
the noise introduced by our algorithm is not only stable over time but also
asymptotically much smaller than the one of the UORO algorithm. We also confirm
these theoretical results experimentally. Further, we show empirically that the
KF-RTRL algorithm captures long-term dependencies and almost matches the
performance of TBPTT on real world tasks by training Recurrent Highway Networks
on a synthetic string memorization task and on the Penn TreeBank task,
respectively. These results indicate that RTRL based approaches might be a
promising future alternative to TBPTT.

underground gamma-ray spectroscopy (GRS) measurements of the samples only a few
minutes after the irradiations, in order to observe activated short-lived
radioisotopes. Three samples were used: an Elekta Synergy flattening filter
never irradiated before, an old flattening filter, unmounted from a linac in
2012 and a tungsten leaf, unmounted from the multileaf collimator (MLC) of the
same linac in 2012. All three samples were measured before the irradiations in
the underground laboratory of la Vue-des-Alpes.
  The new flattening filter and the leaf were then irradiated with ~200 Gy,
first under 15MV and then with 6MV photon beams. The gamma counting began 20
minutes after the irradiations. Irradiations with 15MV led to (n,{\gamma})
activation of short-lived isotopes : In the leaf, the measured activity was
1556 Bq just after the irradiation and we observed various gamma lines from
187W, 57Ni and 56Mn. In the new filter, the activity was 1097 Bq and the gamma
signature of 56Mn, 56Ni, 57Ni and 59Co was clearly present. The germanium
detector allowed to measure gamma lines with relative intensities (branching
ratio BR) down to ~0.1%, thank to its very low background. Irradiations of the
new flattening filter at 6MV led to a small activation of 56Mn.
Gammaspectroscopic data was taken several times after the irradiation to
monitor the time evolution and the total activity. Treating patients with 15MV
photon beams activate long-lived radioisotopes in the linac head. With this
work, it was possible to identify these isotopes, and especially highlight the
created short-lived radioisotopes.

disk has a different side of the polygon as diameter and the midpoint of the

graph with vertices the $n$ disks and two disks are adjacent if and only if
they have a point in common. Such a graph was introduced by Huemer and
P\'erez-Lantero in 2016, proved to be planar and Hamiltonian. In this paper we
study further combinatorial properties of this graph. We prove that the
treewidth is at most 3, by showing an $O(n)$-time algorithm that builds a tree
decomposition of width at most 3, given the polygon as input. This implies that
we can construct the intersection graph of the side disks in $O(n)$ time. We
further study the independence number of this graph, which is the maximum
number of pairwise disjoint disks. The planarity condition implies that for
every convex $n$-gon we can select at least $\lceil n/4 \rceil$ pairwise
disjoint disks, and we prove that for every $n\ge 3$ there exist convex
$n$-gons in which we cannot select more than this number. Finally, we show that
our class of graphs includes all outerplanar Hamiltonian graphs except the
cycle of length four, and that it is a proper subclass of the planar

solution to the problem of web application security. However, the performance
of the system highly relies on the quality of the signatures designed to detect

identify the flaws in the signature structure which are responsible to reduce
the efficiency of the detection system. The paper targets SQL injection
signatures particularly. Initially, some essential concepts of the domain of
the attack that should be focused by the developer in prior to designing the
signatures have been discussed. Afterwards, we conducted a case study on the
well known PHPIDS tool for analyzing the quality of its SQL signatures. Based
on the analysis, we identify various flaws in the designing practice that yield
inefficient signatures. We divide the weak signatures into six categories,
namely incomplete, irrelevant, semi-relevant, susceptible, redundant and
inconsistent signatures. Moreover, we quantify these weaknesses and define them
mathematically in terms of set theory. To the best of our knowledge, we have
identified some novel signature design issues. The paper will basically assist
the signature developer to know what level of expertise is required for
devising a quality signature set and how a little ignorance may lead to
deterioration in the performance of the SIDS. Furthermore, a security expert
may evaluate the detector against the identified flaws by conducting structural

the rotation axis in a rotating system, in comparison with the non-rotating
case. In this study, this phenomenon is investigated as a problem of energy
diffusion expressed by the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model. The
conventional gradient-diffusion approximation for the turbulent energy flux
cannot account for the enhanced energy transport observed in rotating
inhomogeneous turbulence. In order to adequately describe the phenomenon, we
propose a new model for the energy flux due to the pressure associated with the
rotational motion of a fluid. The model of the energy flux is expressed to be
proportional to the turbulent helicity. This property is closely related to the
group velocity of inertial waves in a rapidly rotating fluid. The validity of
the model is assessed using a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of
inhomogeneous turbulence under rotation. It is shown that most of the turbulent
energy transport enhanced by the system rotation is attributed to the pressure
diffusion term. The spatial distribution of the energy flux due to the pressure
related to the system rotation is similar to that of the turbulent helicity
with negative coefficient. Hence, the new model which is proportional to the
turbulent helicity is able to qualitatively account for the enhanced energy
flux due to the system rotation. Finally, the helical Rossby number is proposed
in order to estimate the relative importance of the energy flux enhanced by the
turbulent helicity and the rotation, in comparison to the conventional
gradient-diffusion approximation.

biometric constructs a protected template from the original biometric template
using transformation functions and performs the comparison between templates in
the transformed domain. Recent approaches towards cancelable fingerprint
generation either rely on aligning minutiae points with respect to singular
points (core/delta) or utilize the absolute coordinate positions of minutiae
points. In this paper, we propose a novel non-invertible ridge feature
transformation method to protect the original fingerprint template information.
The proposed method partitions the fingerprint region into a number of sectors
with reference to each minutia point employing a ridge-based co-ordinate
system. The nearest neighbor minutiae in each sector are identified, and
ridge-based features are computed. Further, a cancelable template is generated
by applying the Cantor pairing function followed by random projection. We have
evaluated our method with FVC2002, FVC2004 and FVC2006 databases. It is evident
from the experimental results that the proposed method outperforms existing
methods in the literature. Moreover, the security analysis demonstrates that

dependence of quasienergy on the Berry phase of the charge carrier. The quasi
energy flat band remains unaltered in presence of radiation for dice lattice
($\alpha=1$). However, it acquires a dispersion in and around the Dirac and
even-photon resonant points when $0<\alpha<1$. The valley degeneracy and
electron-hole symmetry in the quasienergy spectrum are broken for $0<\alpha<1$.
Unlike graphene, the mean energy follows closely the linear dispersion of the

already been established that this probability distribution which is also known

exponential tail in the distribution function is attributed to the hopping
motion of particles observed in the supercooled regime. The non-Gaussian nature
can also be explained if one assumes that the system has heterogeneous dynamics

scale of dynamic heterogeneity at which the shape of the van Hove function
crosses over from non-Gaussian to Gaussian. The obtained dynamic heterogeneity
scale is found to be in very good agreement with the scale obtained from other

because the vast majority of isolated galaxies in this stellar mass regime are

tight bounds on this quantity are only known for constant $\delta$. While one
can obtain an upper bound with error probability $\delta$ by repeating a
sketching algorithm with constant error probability $O(\log(1/\delta))$ times
in parallel, and taking the median of the outputs, we show this is a suboptimal

\log(1/\delta) + n^{1-2/p} \log^{2/p} (1/\delta) \log n)$ on the sketching
dimension, for any constant approximation. Our result should be contrasted with
results for estimating frequency moments for $1 \leq p \leq 2$, for which we
show the optimal algorithm for general $\delta$ is obtained by repeating the
optimal algorithm for constant error probability $O(\log(1/\delta))$ times and
taking the median output. We also obtain a matching lower bound for this

the discrepancies between the task models. In this paper, we propose a
model-based technique that automatically estimates the relevance (importance
weight) of each source sample for solving the target task. In the proposed
approach, all the samples are transferred and used by a batch RL algorithm to
solve the target task, but their contribution to the learning process is
proportional to their importance weight. By extending the results for
importance weighting provided in supervised learning literature, we develop a
finite-sample analysis of the proposed batch RL algorithm. Furthermore, we
empirically compare the proposed algorithm to state-of-the-art approaches,
showing that it achieves better learning performance and is very robust to
negative transfer, even when some source tasks are significantly different from
the target task.

summed population (SP) or the labeled line (LL) hypothesis. Responses to
external stimuli are generated by a neuronal population as a whole or the
individual neurons have encoding capacities of their own. The SPIKE-distance
estimated either for a single, pooled spike train over a population or for each
neuron separately can serve to quantify these responses.
  New Method: For the SP case we compare three algorithms that search for the
most discriminative subpopulation over all stimulus pairs. For the LL case we
introduce a new algorithm that combines neurons that individually separate
different pairs of stimuli best.
  Results: The best approach for SP is a brute force search over all possible
subpopulations. However, it is only feasible for small populations. For more
realistic settings, simulated annealing clearly outperforms gradient algorithms
with only a limited increase in computational load. Our novel LL approach can
handle very involved coding scenarios despite its computational ease.
  Comparison with Existing Methods: Spike train distances have been extended to
the analysis of neural populations interpolating between SP and LL coding. This
includes parametrizing the importance of distinguishing spikes being fired in
different neurons. Yet, these approaches only consider the population as a
whole. The explicit focus on subpopulations render our algorithms
complimentary.
  Conclusions: The spectrum of encoding possibilities in neural populations is
broad. The SP and LL cases are two extremes for which our algorithms provide
correct identification results.

with the weighted least-square approach to solve uncertainty quantification
(UQ) problems. The idea of data-driven polynomial chaos is to use statistical
moments of the input random variables to develop an arbitrary polynomial chaos
expansion, and then use such data-driven bases to perform UQ computations. Here
we adopt the bases construction procedure by following
\cite{Ahlfeld_2016SAMBA}, where the bases are computed by using matrix
operations on the Hankel matrix of moments. Different from previous works, in
the postprocessing part, we propose a weighted least-squares approach to solve
UQ problems. This approach includes a sampling strategy and a least-squares
solver. The main features of our approach are two folds: On one hand, our
sampling strategy is independent of the random input. More precisely, we
propose to sampling with the equilibrium measure, and this measure is also
independent of the data-driven bases. Thus, this procedure can be done in prior
(or in a off-line manner). On the other hand, we propose to solve a Christoffel
function weighted least-square problem, and this strategy is quasi-linearly
stable -- the required number of PDE solvers depends linearly (up to a
logarithmic factor) on the number of (data-driven) bases. This new approach is
thus promising in dealing with a class of problems with epistemic
uncertainties. Several numerical tests are presented to show the effectiveness
of our approach.

overcome this limitation, we propose adaptive variational dropout whose
probabilities are drawn from sparsity-inducing beta Bernoulli prior. It allows
each neuron to be evolved either to be generic or specific for certain inputs,
or dropped altogether. Such input-adaptive sparsity-inducing dropout allows the
resulting network to tolerate larger degree of sparsity without losing its
expressive power by removing redundancies among features. We validate our
dependent variational beta-Bernoulli dropout on multiple public datasets, on

without imposing prior size or cardinality constraints on the set of
communities. Despite its potential, the support for parallel computers is
rather limited. The cause is largely the irregularity of the algorithm and the
underlying heuristics imply a sequential nature. In this paper a GPU based
parallelized version of the Louvain method is presented. The Louvain method is
a multi-phase, iterative heuristic for modularity optimization. It was
originally developed by Blondel et al. (2008), the method has become
increasingly popular owing to its ability to detect high modularity community
partitions in a fast and memory-efficient manner. The parallel heuristics used,
were first introduced by Hao Lu et al. (2015). As the Louvain method is
inherently sequential, it limits the possibility of scalable usage. Thanks to
the proposed parallel heuristics, I observe how this method can behave on GPUs.
For evaluation I implemented the heuristics using CUDA on a GeForce GTX 980 GPU
and for testing Ive used organization landscapes from the CERN developed
Collaboration Spotting project that involves patents and publications to
visualize the connections in technologies among its collaborators. Compared to
the parallel Louvain implementation running on 8 threads on the same machine

within an urban area is a crucial concern in urban planning. The lack of a
Decision Support System (DSS) for the assessment of mobility initiatives,
forces local public authorities and mobility service providers to base their
decisions on guidelines derived from common heuristics and best practices.
These approaches can help planners in shaping mobility solutions, but given the
high number of variables to consider the effects are not guaranteed. Therefore,
a solution conceived respecting the available guidelines can result in a
failure in a different context. In particular, difficult aspects to consider
are the interactions between different mobility services available in a given
urban area, and the acceptance of a given mobility initiative by the
inhabitants of the area. In order to fill this gap, we introduce Tangramob, an
agent-based simulation framework capable of assessing the impacts of a Smart
Mobility Initiative (SMI) within an urban area of interest. Tangramob simulates
how urban traffic is expected to evolve as citizens start experiencing the
newly offered traveling solutions. This allows decision makers to evaluate the
efficacy of their initiatives taking into account the current urban system. In
this paper we provide an overview of the simulation framework along with its
design. To show the potential of Tangramob, 3 mobility initiatives are
simulated and compared on the same scenario. This shows how it is possible to

outflows (jets) from the symbiotic prototype Z And during its 2008 and 2009-10

phase. We monitored Z And with the high-resolution spectroscopy, multicolor
$UBVR_{\rm C}$ and high-time-resolution photometry. The well-pronounced bipolar
jets were ejected again during the 2009-10 outburst together with the
simultaneous emergence of the rapid photometric variability ($\Delta m \approx
0.06$ mag) on the timescale of hours, showing similar properties as those
during the 2006 outburst. These phenomena and the measured disk-jets connection
could be caused by the radiation-induced warping of the inner disk due to a
significant increase of the burning WD luminosity. Ejection of transient jets
by Z And around outburst maxima signals a transient accretion at rates above
the upper limit of the stable hydrogen burning on the WD surface. The enhanced
accretion through the disk warping, supplemented by the accretion from the
giant's wind, can keep a high luminosity of the WD for a long time, until
depletion of the disk. In this way, the jets provide a link to long-lasting
active phases of Z And.

a chopper to modulate the detected signal and using a LIA to demodulate. The
effect of 1/f noise of detector, dark current and other noises can be reduced
to get sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The orthogonal vector LIA can
avoid the phase shift on the accuracy of measurement by two orthogonal

realize the LIA which is operated in a microcontroller with ARM cortex-M4. Data
is obtained through ADC and the signal of detector is amplified and filtered.
Then the phase sensitive detection (PSD), low-pass filter (LPF) and amplitude

different equivalent noise bandwidth (ENB). The algorithm has the specification

susceptibility, and changes in symmetry and in transport are seen at other
characteristic temperatures. We report a meta-analysis of all measurements of
characteristic temperatures well above $T_c$ in strontium doped lanthanum

pseudogap line is one of a family of four straight lines which stretches across
the phase diagram from low to high doping, and from $T_c$ up to $700$ K. These

In most of the previous work on cognitive biases in algorithmic game theory

analyzing the implications and mitigating their negative consequences. In
contrast, in this paper we show how in some cases cognitive biases can be
harnessed to obtain better outcomes.
  Specifically, we study Walrasian equilibria in combinatorial markets. It is
well known that Walrasian equilibria exist only in limited settings, e.g., when
all valuations are gross substitutes, but fails to exist in more general
settings, e.g., when the valuations are submodular. We consider combinatorial
settings in which bidders exhibit the endowment effect, that is, their value
for items increases with ownership.
  Our main result shows that when the valuations are submodular, even a mild
degree of endowment effect is sufficient to guarantee the existence of
Walrasian equilibria. In fact, we show that in contrast to Walrasian equilibria
with standard utility maximizing bidders -- in which the equilibrium allocation
must be efficient -- when bidders exhibit endowment effect any local optimum
can be an equilibrium allocation.
  Our techniques reveal interesting connections between the LP relaxation of
combinatorial auctions and local maxima. We also provide lower bounds on the
intensity of the endowment effect that the bidders must have in order to
guarantee the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium in various settings.

width varies by almost a factor 2 dependent on the data used. Here we trace the
majority of this inconsistency to different measurements of the $(p,\alpha)$

optimization problems that is mostly encountered in various areas of science
and engineering. Studying optimization problems motivates to develop advanced
techniques more suited to contemporary practical problems. Among those,
especially the NP hard problems provide an apt platform to demonstrate
supremacy of quantum over classical technologies in terms of resources and
time. TSP is one such NP hard problem in combinatorial optimization which takes
exponential time order for solving by brute force method. Here we propose a
quantum algorithm to solve the travelling salesman problem using phase
estimation technique. We approach the problem by encoding the given distances
between the cities as phases. We construct unitary operators whose eigenvectors
are the computational basis states and eigenvalues are various combinations of
these phases. Then we apply phase estimation algorithm to certain eigenstates
which give us all the total distances possible for all the routes. After
obtaining the distances we can search through this information using the
quantum search algorithm for finding the minimum to find the least possible
distance as well the route taken. This provides us a quadratic speedup over the
classical brute force method for a large number of cities. In this paper, we
illustrate an example of the travelling salesman problem by taking four cities
and present the results by simulating the codes in the IBM's quantum simulator.

infinite length. Such a model corresponds to a core-shell nanowire with an
insulating core and a conductive shell. In a prismatic shell the lowest energy
states are localized along the edges (corners) of the prism and are separated
by a considerable energy gap from the states localized on the prism facets. The
corner localization is robust in the presence of a magnetic field longitudinal
to the wire. If the magnetic field is transversal to the wire the lowest states
can be shifted to the lateral regions of the shell, relatively to the direction
of the field. These localization effects should be observable in transport
experiments on semiconductor core-shell nanowires, typically with hexagonal
geometry. We show that the conductance of the prismatic structures considerably
differs from the one of circular nanowires. The effects are observed for
sufficiently thin hexagonal wires and become much more pronounced for square
and triangular shells. To the best of our knowledge the internal geometry of
such nanowires is not revealed in experimental studies. We show that with
properly designed nanowires these localization effects may become an important
resource of interesting phenomenology.

approach the problem with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and propose a

super-resolution network that upscales the low-resolution images, and ii) an
ensemble of face recognition models that act as identity priors for the
super-resolution network during training. Different from competing
super-resolution approaches that typically rely on a single model for upscaling
(even with large magnification factors), our network uses a cascade of multiple
SR models that progressively upscale the low-resolution images using steps of
$2\times$. This characteristic allows us to apply supervision signals (target
appearances) at different resolutions and incorporate identity constraints at
multiple-scales. Our model is able to upscale (very) low-resolution images
captured in unconstrained conditions and produce visually convincing results.

strong regularization to prevent overfitting. Here we show that this rule can
be violated by linear regression in the underdetermined $n\ll p$ situation

Moreover, the optimal value of ridge penalty in this situation can be negative.
This happens when the high-variance directions in the predictor space can
predict the response variable, which is often the case in the real-world
high-dimensional data. In this regime, low-variance directions provide an
implicit ridge regularization and can make any further positive ridge penalty
detrimental. We prove that augmenting any linear model with random covariates

ridge penalty. We use a spiked covariance model as an analytically tractable
example and prove that the optimal ridge penalty in this case is negative when

integers in an interval are essential to the Fisher-Yates random shuffle.
Consequently, popular languages like Java, Python, C++, Swift and Go include
ranged random integer generation functions as part of their runtime libraries.
  Pseudo-random values are usually generated in words of a fixed number of bits
(e.g., 32 bits, 64 bits) using algorithms such as a linear congruential
generator. We need functions to convert such random words to random integers in
an interval ([0,s)) without introducing statistical biases. The standard
functions in programming languages such as Java involve integer divisions.
Unfortunately, division instructions are relatively expensive. We review an
unbiased function to generate ranged integers from a source of random words
that avoids integer divisions with high probability. To establish the practical
usefulness of the approach, we show that this algorithm can multiply the speed
of unbiased random shuffling on x64 processors. Our proposed approach has been
adopted by the Go language for its implementation of the shuffle function.

preprocessed by dark matter filaments can be further accreted into residing
individual low-mass haloes in directions along the filaments. Consequently,
comparing with field haloes, gas accretion is very anisotropic for filament
haloes. About 30 percent of the accreted gas of a residing filament halo was
preprocessed by filaments, leading to two different thermal histories for the
gas in filament haloes. Filament haloes have higher baryon and stellar
fractions when comparing with their field counterparts. Without including
stellar feedback, our results suggest that filaments assist gas cooling and
enhance star formation in their residing dark matter haloes at high redshifts

their smectic phase the primary order parameter is a tilt vector associated
with molecular rotations around the long molecular axis parallel to the
director. The molecular rotations lead to several distinct phases among which a
domain-wall texture with a periodic-kink soliton profile. In this study the
formation of domain walls in smectic chiral liquid crystals is analyzed, with
emphasis on the competition between ising-type symmetric and antisymmetric
nearest-neighbor interactions, and an in-plane electric field. It is found that
antisymmetric intermolecular interactions, which are of chiral origin, increase
the width of kink structures in the domain wall at moderate intensity of the
$y$ component of the electric field. Increasing the $x$ component of the
electric field creates unstable condition for soliton formation irrespective of
magnitudes of the symmetric and chiral intermolecular interactions. Stability
condition for single-kink domain-wall structures in the discrete molecular
chain, is discussed by estimating the Peierls stress experienced by the
single-kink soliton. Results suggest that chirality lowers the Peierls-Nabarro
barrier, hence increasing the lifetime of single-kink structures in the
discrete medium.

  collector and Transport layer","34 pages, 14 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We demonstrate an improvement in the performance of organic photovoltaic
(OPV) systems based on small molecules by ionic gating via controlled
reversible n-doping of multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) coated on fullerenes
ETL: C60 and C70. Such electric double layer charging (EDLC) doping, achieved
by ionic liquid (IL) charging, allows tuning the electronic concentration in
MWCNT and in the fullerene planar acceptor layers, increasing it by orders of
magnitude. This leads to decreasing the series and increasing the shunt
resistances of OPV and allows to use of thick (up to 200 nm) ETLs, increasing
the durability and stability of OPV. Two stages of OPV enhancement are
described, upon the increase of gating bias Vg: at small (or even zero) Vg the
extended interface of IL and porous transparent MWCNT is charged by gating, and
the fullerene charge collector is significantly improved, becoming an ohmic
contact. This changes the S-shaped I-V curve via improving the electron
collection by n-doped MWCNT cathode with ohmic interfacial contact. The I-V
curves further improve at higher gating bias Vg due to the raising of the Fermi
level and lowering of MWCNT work function. At the next qualitative stage, the
acceptor fullerene layer becomes n-doped by electron injection from MWCNT while
ions of IL penetrate into fullerene. At this step the internal built-in field
is created within OPV, which helps exciton dissociation and charge
separation/transport, increasing further the Jsc and the FF (Fill factor).
Overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases nearly 50 times in
CuPc/fullerene OPV with MWCNT cathode. The concept of ionically gated MWCNT-ETL
interface is numerically simulated by the drift-diffusion model which allows to
fit the observed I-V curves.

from the approximate posterior, so we usually choose simple (e.g. factorised)
approximate posteriors in which sampling is an efficient computation that fully
exploits GPU parallelism. However, such simple approximate posteriors are often
insufficient, as they eliminate statistical dependencies in the posterior.
While it is possible to use normalizing flow approximate posteriors for
continuous latents, some problems have discrete latents and strong statistical
dependencies. The most natural approach to model these dependencies is an
autoregressive distribution, but sampling from such distributions is inherently
sequential and thus slow. We develop a fast, parallel sampling procedure for
autoregressive distributions based on fixed-point iterations which enables
efficient and accurate variational inference in discrete state-space latent
variable dynamical systems. To optimize the variational bound, we considered
two ways to evaluate probabilities: inserting the relaxed samples directly into
the pmf for the discrete distribution, or converting to continuous logistic
latent variables and interpreting the K-step fixed-point iterations as a
normalizing flow. We found that converting to continuous latent variables gave
considerable additional scope for mismatch between the true and approximate
posteriors, which resulted in biased inferences, we thus used the former
approach. Using our fast sampling procedure, we were able to realize the
benefits of correlated posteriors, including accurate uncertainty estimates for
one cell, and accurate connectivity estimates for multiple cells, in an order
of magnitude less time.

with the complementary tasks of learning object instances (episodic memory) and
categories (semantic memory). Both growing networks can expand in response to
novel sensory experience: the episodic memory learns fine-grained
spatiotemporal representations of object instances in an unsupervised fashion
while the semantic memory uses task-relevant signals to regulate structural
plasticity levels and develop more compact representations from episodic
experience. For the consolidation of knowledge in the absence of external
sensory input, the episodic memory periodically replays trajectories of neural
reactivations. We evaluate the proposed model on the CORe50 benchmark dataset

pseudoscalar mesons scattering off charmed mesons, which have been well
determined from lattice calculations and experimental data. Our calculations
result in a spectrum richer than that of heavy mesons. We find two very narrow
$J^P=1/2^-$ $\Omega_{cc}^P$, which very likely decay into $\Omega_{cc}\pi^0$
breaking isospin symmetry. In the isospin-1/2 $\Xi_{cc}^P$ sector, three states
are predicted to exist below 4.2~GeV with the lowest one being narrow and the
other two rather broad. We suggest to search for the $\Xi_{cc}^{P}$ states in
the $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\pi^-$ mode. Searching for them and their analogues are
helpful to establish the hadron spectrum.

given sequence of images. The main difficulty is how to generate image-specific
sentences within the context of overall images. Here we propose a deep learning
network model, GLAC Net, that generates visual stories by combining
global-local (glocal) attention and context cascading mechanisms. The model
incorporates two levels of attention, i.e., overall encoding level and image
feature level, to construct image-dependent sentences. While standard attention
configuration needs a large number of parameters, the GLAC Net implements them
in a very simple way via hard connections from the outputs of encoders or image
features onto the sentence generators. The coherency of the generated story is
further improved by conveying (cascading) the information of the previous
sentence to the next sentence serially. We evaluate the performance of the GLAC
Net on the visual storytelling dataset (VIST) and achieve very competitive
results compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. Our code and pre-trained

dynamics, one often sees dynamical behavior reflected in parameter space and
vice versa. This duality was first exploited by Douady, Hubbard and their
students in early work on rational maps. See \cite{DH,BH} for example. Here, we
continue to study these ideas in the realm of transcendental functions.
  In \cite{KK1}, it was shown that for the tangent family, $\lambda \tan z$,
the way the hyperbolic components meet at a point where the asymptotic value
eventually lands on infinity reflects the dynamic behavior of the functions at
infinity. In the first part of this paper we show that this duality extends to
a much more general class of transcendental meromorphic functions that we call
{\em generalized Nevanlinna functions} with the additional property that
infinity is not an asymptotic value. In particular, we show that in
""dynamically natural"" one dimensional slices of parameter space, there are
""hyperbolic-like"" components with a unique distinguished boundary point whose
dynamics reflect the behavior inside an asymptotic tract at infinity. Our main
result is that {\em every} parameter point in such a slice for which the
asymptotic value eventually lands on a pole is such a distinguished boundary
point.
  In the second part of the paper, we apply this result to the families
$\lambda \tan^p z^q$, $p,q \in \mathbb Z^+$, to prove that all hyperbolic
components of period greater than $1$ are bounded.

longitudinal direction. The transport of the barrier is determined by the
chirality of active particles. The moving barrier and active particles move in
the opposite directions. The average velocity of the barrier is much larger

process. Previous qualitative studies hinted at how decomposing change sets
into multiple yet internally coherent ones would improve the reviewing process.
So far, literature provided no quantitative analysis of this hypothesis.
  Aims: (1) Quantitatively measure the effects of change decomposition on the
outcome of code review (in terms of number of found defects, wrongly reported
issues, suggested improvements, time, and understanding); (2) Qualitatively
analyze how subjects approach the review and navigate the code, building
knowledge and addressing existing issues, in large vs. decomposed changes.
  Method: Controlled experiment using the pull-based development model
involving 28 software developers among professionals and graduate students.
  Results: Change decomposition leads to fewer wrongly reported issues,
influences how subjects approach and conduct the review activity (by increasing
context-seeking), yet impacts neither understanding the change rationale nor
the number of found defects.
  Conclusions: Change decomposition reduces the noise for subsequent data
analyses but also significantly supports the tasks of the developers in charge
of reviewing the changes. As such, commits belonging to different concepts
should be separated, adopting this as a best practice in software engineering.

laboratory for studying planet formation in extreme conditions. In our first
paper (Paper I) of a series Xie et al. (2011), we have shown that the
intermediate stage - from planetesimals to planetary embryos/cores - of planet
formation can proceed even in highly inclined binaries. Following Paper I, here
we numerically study the late stage of terrestrial planet formation, i.e., from
embryos to full planets, in binary systems of various orbital configurations.
We identify an orbital alignment or anti-alignment effect; namely, although an
inclined binary generally misaligns the planetary orbits with respect to the
spin axis of the primary host star (i.e., causing large obliquity), it could
align or anti-align the planetary orbits with respect to the binary orbit. Such
an orbital (anti-)alignment effect is caused by the combination of orbital
differential precession and self-damping, and it is mostly significant in cases
of intermediate binary separations, i.e., a_B~40-200 AU for terrestrial planet
formation around 1 AU from the primary stars. In such intermediate separation
binaries, somewhat contrary to intuition, the binary companion can aid planet
growth by having increased the rate of collisions, forming significantly more
massive but fewer planets. In the other two ends, the companion is ether too
close thus plays a violently disruptive role or too wide to have significant
effect on planet formation. Future observations, which can discover more
planet-bearing binary star systems and constrain their masses and 3-D orbital
motions will test our numerical findings.

black-box setting, where the attacker is restricted solely to query access.
Existing black-box approaches to generating adversarial examples typically
require a significant number of queries, either for training a substitute
network or performing gradient estimation. We introduce GenAttack, a
gradient-free optimization technique that uses genetic algorithms for
synthesizing adversarial examples in the black-box setting. Our experiments on
different datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet) show that GenAttack can
successfully generate visually imperceptible adversarial examples against
state-of-the-art image recognition models with orders of magnitude fewer
queries than previous approaches. Against MNIST and CIFAR-10 models, GenAttack
required roughly 2,126 and 2,568 times fewer queries respectively, than ZOO,
the prior state-of-the-art black-box attack. In order to scale up the attack to
large-scale high-dimensional ImageNet models, we perform a series of
optimizations that further improve the query efficiency of our attack leading
to 237 times fewer queries against the Inception-v3 model than ZOO.
Furthermore, we show that GenAttack can successfully attack some
state-of-the-art ImageNet defenses, including ensemble adversarial training and
non-differentiable or randomized input transformations. Our results suggest
that evolutionary algorithms open up a promising area of research into
effective black-box attacks.

abstract entities that can have both continuous and discrete concrete
manifestations. Generating the continuous and discrete manifestations of LCTs
from the same abstract operator framework allows us to define the continuous

hyperdifferential operators, we obtain a DLCT matrix which is totally
compatible with the theory of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its dual
and circulant structure, which makes further analytical manipulations and
progress possible. The proposed DLCT is to the continuous LCT, what the DFT is
to the continuous Fourier transform (FT). The DLCT of the signal is obtained
simply by multiplying the vector holding the samples of the input signal by the
DLCT matrix.

consider pin accessibility during standard cells layout to increase the number
of feasible solutions available to the router. In this work, we will
demonstrate several improvements with the Synopsys PAC methodology, such as
reducing the number of cells required for each Synopsys 'testcell' with the

for better pin accessibility evaluation. We also recommend additional

the Interstellar Medium (ISM) of spiral and dwarf galaxies. Observationally,
H~{\sc i} 21-cm radiation provides a good probe of these stochastic processes
and helps us to know more about their nature and generating mechanism.
Structure function, auto-correlation function, power spectrum are some of
statistical estimators of these fluctuations which have been used in
literature, whose studies helps in understanding the generating mechanisms of
these structures. In this thesis we are interested in estimating the column
density and velocity power spectrum at scales as large as 10 Kpc, to understand
the energy associated with these structures and the type of forcing of the
turbulence. Estimating power spectrum from observations can be done either by
using the directly measured quantity visibility or by reconstructing the sky
brightness distribution (or image) from the visibilities. By using simulated
observations of a model galaxy with known power spectrum we find that the
visibility based estimator reproduce the true power spectrum. The image based
estimator has a scale dependent bias that is highly correlated to the
incompleteness in the baseline coverage of the interferometer. Interestingly,
we found that the noise in the reconstructed image has zero mean and hence the
locally averaged quantities estimated from the reconstructed image are
unbiased. We implement the visibility moment estimator as discussed in Dutta et
al. (2015) and estimate the line of sight velocity fluctuation of the spiral
galaxy NGC6946. Our result strongly indicate presence of large scale turbulence
in the spiral galaxies. We conclude that we would need to have higher signal to
noise H~{\sc i}observations to definitively comment on the generating
mechanisms of the large scale turbulence.

overall loss of terrestrial ecosystem production and biodiversity due to the
forest fire. The current research focuses on assessing the impact of forest
fire severity on terrestrial ecosystem productivity using different burn
indices in Uttarakhand, India. Satellite-based land surface temperature (LST)
was calculated for pre-fire (2014) and fire (2016) year using MODerate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to identify the burn area hotspots
across all eco-regions in Uttarakhand. In this study, spatial and temporal
changes of different vegetation and burn area indices i.e Normalized Burn Ratio
(NBR), Burnt Area Index (BAI), Normalized Multiband Drought Index (NMDI), Soil
Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI),
Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI)were estimated for both pre-fire and fire years. Additionally, two Light
Use Efficiency (LUE) models i.e Carnegie- Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) and
Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) were selected to quantify the terrestrial
Net Primary Productivity (NPP) in pre-fire and fire years across all biomes of
the study area.The present approach appears to be promising and has a potential
in quantifying the loss of ecosystem productivity due to forest fires. A
detailed field observation data is required for further training, and testing
of remotely sensed fire maps for future research.

from packing of an array of molecules in which intermolecular interactions are
dominantly dispersive, including hydrogen-bond, van der Waals and London-type
forces. These forces are usually relatively weaker than covalent and ionic
bondings such that long-range intermolecular interactions should play important
role in dispersion properties of molecular crystals such as polymers and
biomolecular chain structures. In this work the effects of long but
finite-range intermolecular interactions on single-exciton dispersion energy,
and hence on characteristic parameters of periodic soliton trains associated
with bound exciton-polariton states in one-dimensional molecular crystals
interacting with an electromagnetic field, are investigated. Long-range
interactions are shown to quantitatively modify the exciton-polariton soliton
amplitudes, width and velocity as a result of shrinkage of the single-exciton
energy spectrum. The soliton structures of interest are nonlinear wavetrains,
consisting of periodically ordered single-pulse (i.e. bright) or single-kink
(i.e. dark) solitons with equal separation between the constituent
single-soliton modes. Periodic soliton structures are relevant and best suited
for finite-size chain systems, where periodic boundary conditions rule the
generation of nonlinear wave profiles. Generally they are of weaker
nonlinearity compared to their single-soliton constituents as well established
within the framework of their generation via the process of modulational
instability

called majority model, on the binomial random graph $\mathcal{G}_{n,p}$ and
regular expanders. First we consider the behavior of the majority model in
$\mathcal{G}_{n,p}$ with an initial random configuration, where each node is
blue independently with probability $p_b$ and red otherwise. It is shown that
in this setting the process goes through a phase transition at the connectivity
threshold, namely $\frac{\log n}{n}$. Furthermore, we discuss the majority
model is a `good' and `fast' density classifier on regular expanders. More
precisely, we prove if the second-largest absolute eigenvalue of the adjacency
matrix of an $n$-node $\Delta$-regular graph is sufficiently smaller than
$\Delta$ then the majority model by starting from $(\frac{1}{2}-\delta)n$ blue
nodes (for an arbitrarily small constant $\delta>0$) results in fully red

results, we show Ramanujan graphs are asymptotically optimally immune, that is
for an $n$-node $\Delta$-regular Ramanujan graph if the initial number of blue

To
answer this question and understand post-acquisition behavior and its related
individual differences, we propose a psychological principle that naturally
extends associative models of Pavlovian conditioning to a dynamical oscillatory
model where subjects have a greater memory capacity than usually postulated,
but with greater forecast uncertainty. This results in a greater resistance to
learning in the first few sessions followed by an over-optimal response peak
and a sequence of progressively damped response oscillations. We detected the
first peak and trough of the new learning curve in our data, but their
dispersion was too large to also check the presence of oscillations with
smaller amplitude. We ran an unusually long experiment with 32 rats over 3960
trials, where we excluded habituation and other well-known phenomena as sources
of variability in the subjects' performance. Using the data of this and another
Pavlovian experiment by Harris et al. (2015), as an illustration of the
principle we tested the theory against the basic associative single-cue
Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model. We found evidence that the RW model is the best
nonlinear regression to data only for a minority of the subjects, while its
dynamical extension can explain the almost totality of data with strong to very
strong evidence. Finally, an analysis of short-scale fluctuations of individual
responses showed that they are described by random white noise, in contrast
with the colored-noise findings in human performance.

With secure spatial modulation, the achievable secrecy rate does not have an
easy-to-compute mathematical expression, and hence, has to be evaluated
numerically, which leads to high complexity in the optimal precoder design. To
address this issue, an accurate and analytical approximation of the secrecy
rate is derived in this work. Using this approximation as the objective
function, two low-complexity linear precoding methods based on gradient descend
(GD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) are proposed. The GD-based
method has much lower complexity but usually converges to a local optimum. On
the other hand, the SCA-based method uses semi-definite relaxation to deal with
the non-convexity in the precoder optimization problem and achieves
near-optimal solution. Compared with the existing GD-based precoder design in
the literature that directly uses the exact and numerically evaluated secrecy
capacity as the objective function, the two proposed designs have significantly
lower complexity. Our SCA-based design even achieves a higher secrecy rate than
the existing GD-based design.

about the associated temporal properties. Here, we show how Machine Learning
can overcome this limitation by predicting statistics for the maximum intensity
of temporal peaks in modulation instability based only on spectral
measurements. Specifically, we train a neural network based Machine Learning
model to correlate spectral and temporal properties of optical fibre modulation
instability using data from numerical simulations, and we then use this model
to predict the temporal probability distribution based on high-dynamic range
spectral data from experiments. These results open novel perspectives in all
