words in a target language (e.g., Vietnamese). This conversion considers the
phonological structure of the target language, as the transliterated output
needs to be pronounceable in the target language. For example, a word in
Vietnamese that begins with a consonant cluster is phonologically invalid and
thus would be an incorrect output of a transliteration system. Most statistical
transliteration approaches, albeit being widely adopted, do not explicitly
model the target language's phonology, which often results in invalid outputs.
The problem is compounded by the limited linguistic resources available when
converting foreign words to transliterated words in the target language. In
this work, we present a phonology-augmented statistical framework suitable for
transliteration, especially when only limited linguistic resources are
available. We propose the concept of pseudo-syllables as structures
representing how segments of a foreign word are organized according to the
syllables of the target language's phonology. We performed transliteration
experiments on Vietnamese and Cantonese. We show that the proposed framework
outperforms the statistical baseline by up to 44.68% relative, when there are

is forecasted to soon reach peta- and exabyte scales. Applications which
process and analyze scientific data must be scalable and focus on execution
performance to keep pace. In the field of radio astronomy, in addition to
increasingly large datasets, tasks such as the identification of transient
radio signals from extrasolar sources are computationally expensive. We present
a scalable approach to radio pulsar detection written in Scala that
parallelizes candidate identification to take advantage of in-memory task
processing using Apache Spark on a YARN distributed system. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel automated multiclass supervised machine learning technique
that we combine with feature selection to reduce the time required for
candidate classification. Experimental testing on a Beowulf cluster with 15
data nodes shows that the parallel implementation of the identification
algorithm offers a speedup of up to 5X that of a similar multithreaded
implementation. Further, we show that the combination of automated multiclass
classification and feature selection speeds up the execution performance of the
RandomForest machine learning algorithm by an average of 54% with less than a
2% average reduction in the algorithm's ability to correctly classify pulsars.
The generalizability of these results is demonstrated by using two real-world
radio astronomy data sets.

mechanisms that generate relativistic particles in the Milky Way, and about the
properties of the Galaxy that control their propagation. Relativistic electrons
and positrons traveling in interstellar space lose energy much more rapidly
than more massive particles such as protons and nuclei, with a rate that grows
quadratically with the particle energy $E$. One therefore expects that the
effects of energy loss should leave observable signatures in the $e^\mp$
spectra, in the form of softenings centered at the critical energy $E^*$. This
quantity is determined by the condition that the total energy loss suffered by
particles during their residence time in the Galaxy is of the same order of the
initial energy. If the electrons and positrons are accelerated in discrete
(quasi) point--like astrophysical objects, such as Supernova explosions or
Pulsars, the stochastic nature of the sources should also leave observable
signatures in the $e^\mp$ energy spectra and angular distributions above a
second (higher) critical energy $E^\dagger$, determined by the condition that
particles with $E \gtrsim E^\dagger$ can propagate only for a maximum distance
shorter than the average separation between sources. In this work we discuss
the theoretically expectations for the signatures of the energy loss effects on
the electron and positron spectra, and compare these predictions with the
existing observations. Recent measurements of the $(e^- + e^+$) flux have
discovered the existence of a prominent spectral break at $E \simeq 1$~TeV.
This spectral feature can perhaps be identified with the critical energy $E^*$.
An alternative hypothesis is to assmume that $E^*$ has a much lower value of
order few GeV. Resolving this ambiguity is of great importance for our
understanding of Galactic cosmic rays.

reproduce target spike trains from provided neural firing data is a central
problem in computational neuroscience and spike-based computing. The discovery
of the optimal weight values can be posed as a supervised learning task wherein
the weights of the model network are chosen to maximize the similarity between
the target spike trains and the model outputs. It is still largely unknown
whether optimizing spike train similarity of highly recurrent SNNs produces
weight matrices similar to those of the ground truth model. To this end, we
propose flexible heuristic supervised learning rules, termed Pre-Synaptic Pool
Modification (PSPM), that rely on stochastic weight updates in order to produce
spikes within a short window of the desired times and eliminate spikes outside
of this window. PSPM improves spike train similarity for all-to-all SNNs and
makes no assumption about the post-synaptic potential of the neurons or the
structure of the network since no gradients are required. We test whether
optimizing for spike train similarity entails the discovery of accurate weights
and explore the relative contributions of local and homeostatic weight updates.
Although PSPM improves similarity between spike trains, the learned weights
often differ from the weights of the ground truth model, implying that
connectome inference from spike data may require additional constraints on
connectivity statistics. We also find that spike train similarity is sensitive
to local updates, but other measures of network activity such as avalanche
distributions, can be learned through synaptic homeostasis.

forecasting require timely status updates for their efficient operation. Age of
Information (AoI) is a newly proposed metric that effectively captures this
requirement. Recent research on the subject has derived AoI optimal policies
for the generation of status updates and AoI optimal packet queueing
disciplines. Unlike previous research we focus on low-end devices that
typically support monitoring applications in the context of the Internet of
Things. We acknowledge that these devices host a diverse set of applications
some of which are AoI sensitive while others are not. Furthermore, due to their
limited computational resources they typically utilize a simple First-In
First-Out (FIFO) queueing discipline. We consider the problem of optimally
controlling the status update generation process for a system with a
source-destination pair that communicates via a wireless link, whereby the
source node is comprised of a FIFO queue and two applications, one that is AoI
sensitive and one that is not. We formulate this problem as a dynamic
programming problem and utilize the framework of Markov Decision Processes to
derive optimal policies for the generation of status update packets. Due to the
lack of comparable methods in the literature, we compare the derived optimal
policies against baseline policies, such as the zero-wait policy, and
investigate the performance of all policies for a variety of network
configurations. Results indicate that existing status update policies fail to
capture the trade-off between frequent generation of status updates and
queueing delay and thus perform poorly.

appear in clusters instead of scattered along the time frame. Identifying
clusters and estimating their size are important problems arising in statistics
of extremes or in the study of quantitative recurrence for dynamical systems.
In the classical literature, the Extremal Index appears associated to the
cluster size and, in fact, it is usually interpreted as the reciprocal of the
mean cluster size. This quantity involves a passage to the limit and in some
special cases this interpretation fails due to an escape of mass when computing
the limiting point processes. Smith \cite{S88} introduced a regenerative
process exhibiting such disagreement. Very recently, in \cite{AFF18} the
authors used a dynamical mechanism to emulate the same inadequacy of the usual
interpretation of the Extremal Index. Here, we consider a general regenerative
process that includes Smith's model and show that it is important to consider
finite time quantities instead of asymptotic ones and compare their different
behaviours in relation to the cluster size. We consider other indicators such
as what we call the sojourn time, which corresponds to the size of groups of
abnormal observations, when there is some uncertainty regarding where the
cluster containing that group was actually initiated. We also study the decay
of correlations of the non-Markovian models considered.

that combine electrical, optical and mechanical elements have emerged. In these
devices, such as optomechanical waveguides and resonators, optical photons and

of solutions is also expected, which is implied by the physical model and is
crucial to the entropy structure. The semi-discrete numerical scheme we propose

positivity-preserving procedure in Zhang (2017) [42] in many scenarios. Hence
the resulting fully discrete scheme is able to produce non-negative solutions.
The method can be applied to both one-dimensional problems and two-dimensional
problems on Cartesian meshes. Numerical examples are given to examine the

subspace. We show that sparsifiers with a near-linear number of edges in the
dimension of the subspace exist. Our setting generalizes that of Schur
complement sparsifiers. Our approach produces sparsifiers by sampling a
uniformly random spanning tree of the input graph and using that tree to guide
an edge elimination procedure that contracts, deletes, and reweights edges. In
the context of Schur complement sparsifiers, our approach has two benefits over
prior work. First, it produces a sparsifier in almost-linear time with no
runtime dependence on the desired error. We directly exploit this to compute
approximate effective resistances for a small set of vertex pairs in faster
time than prior work (Durfee-Kyng-Peebles-Rao-Sachdeva '17). Secondly, it
yields sparsifiers that are reweighted minors of the input graph. As a result,
we give a near-optimal answer to a variant of the Steiner point removal
problem.
  A key ingredient of our algorithm is a subroutine of independent interest: a
near-linear time algorithm that, given a chosen set of vertices, builds a data
structure from which we can query a multiplicative approximation to the
decrease in the effective resistance between two vertices after identifying all
vertices in the chosen set to a single vertex with inverse polynomial
additional additive error in near-constant time.

critical mass-energy density in our Universe. The nature of dark matter is
currently unknown, with the mass of possible constituents spanning nearly one
hundred orders of magnitude. The ultralight scalar field dark matter,
consisting of extremely light bosons with $m \sim 10^{-22}$ eV and often called
""fuzzy"" dark matter, provides intriguing solutions to some challenges at
sub-Galactic scales for the standard cold dark matter model. As shown by
Khmelnitsky and Rubakov, such a scalar field in the Galaxy would produce an
oscillating gravitational potential with nanohertz frequencies, resulting in
periodic variations in the times of arrival of radio pulses from pulsars. The
Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) has been monitoring 20 millisecond pulsars at
two to three weeks intervals for more than a decade. In addition to the
detection of nanohertz gravitational waves, PPTA offers the opportunity for
direct searches for fuzzy dark matter in an astrophysically feasible range of
masses. We analyze the latest PPTA data set which includes timing observations
for 26 pulsars made between 2004 and 2016. We perform a search in this data set
for evidence of ultralight dark matter in the Galaxy using Bayesian and
Frequentist methods. No statistically significant detection has been made. We
therefore place upper limits on the local dark matter density. Our limits,
improving on previous searches by a factor of two to five, constrain the dark
matter density of ultralight bosons with $m \leq 10^{-23}$ eV to be below
$6\,\text{GeV}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ with 95\% confidence in the Earth neighborhood.
Finally, we discuss the prospect of probing the astrophysically favored mass

high-resolution bathymetry measurements in the East River and the 30 turbines
placed in 10 TriFrame arrangements as designed by Verdant Power. A locally
refined, near the individual turbines, background unstructured Cartesian grid
enables LES across a range of geometric scales of relevance spanning
approximately five orders of magnitude. The simulated flow-field is compared
with a baseline LES of the flow in the East River without turbines. While
velocity deficits and increased levels of turbulence kinetic energy are
observed in the vicinity of the turbine wakes, away from the turbines as well

Therefore, our results point to the conclusion that MHK energy harvesting from

properties including convexity and polarity, the arc-support line segments are
extracted, which grounds the successful detection of ellipses. The arc-support
groups are formed by iteratively and robustly linking the arc-support line
segments that latently belong to a common ellipse. Afterward, two complementary
approaches, namely, locally selecting the arc-support group with higher
saliency and globally searching all the valid paired groups, are adopted to fit
the initial ellipses in a fast way. Then, the ellipse candidate set can be
formulated by hierarchical clustering of 5D parameter space of initial
ellipses. Finally, the salient ellipse candidates are selected and refined as
detections subject to the stringent and effective verification. Extensive

values in $\{0,1\}$ and $\lbrack n\rbrack =\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, called
respectively characteristic functions and graduated functions. We show that
their codimension-one level sets exactly permutohedral blades.
  Using ring-theoretic arguments we show that a blade decomposes as a Minkowski
sum of tripods and one-dimensional subspaces. For each triangulation of a
cyclically oriented polygon there exists such a factorization. In the language
of tropical geometry, this constructs a tropical hypersurface as a Minkowski
sum of tropical lines.
  We use the principle of inclusion/exclusion to construct a collection of
piecewise constant functions of blades which we enumerate by the dimension of
the support of the function. On the induced $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space one has
an induced grading; this grading is compatible with various quotient spaces
appearing in algebra, topology and scattering amplitudes. This vector space
maps homomorphically onto the so-called $\Delta$-algebra, which appears in the

learns multi hierarchical representations under different receptive fields. The
output features are recalibrated by the effective kernel and channel attentions

barred galaxies, making this the largest sample studied so far in this way. Our
sample is selected from the MaNGA first public data release as part of SDSS
Data Release 13 according mainly to the axis ratio and position angle
difference between the bar and disc, while kinematic data is from the later
SDSS Data Release 14. We have used both the photometric position angle from the
photometric image and the kinematic position angle from the stellar velocity
map to derive the pattern speed. Combining three independent bar length
measurements and the circular velocity from Jeans Anisotropic modelling (JAM),
we also determine the dimensionless ratio $\cal{R}$ of the corotation radius to
the bar length. We find that the galaxy's position angle is the main
uncertainty in determining the bar pattern speed. The kinematic position angle
leads to fewer ultrafast bars than the photometric position angle, and this
could be due to the method of measuring the kinematic position angle. We study
the dependence of $\cal{R}$ values on galaxy properties such as the dark matter
fraction from JAM modelling and the stellar age and metallicity from stellar
population synthesis (SPS). A positive correlation between the bar length and
bar strength is found: the longer the bar, the stronger the bar. However, no

embedding method which shows great promise as a method of defeating the
inherent exponential cost scaling of multiconfigurational wave function-based
calculations by breaking large systems into smaller, coupled subsystems.
However, we recently [JCTC 2018, 14, 1960] encountered evidence that the
single-determinantal bath picture inherent to DMET is sometimes problematic
when the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) is used as a
solver and the method is applied to realistic models of strongly-correlated
molecules. Here, we show this problem can be defeated by generalizing DMET to
use a multiconfigurational wave function as a bath without sacrificing
attractive features of DMET, such as a second-quantized embedded subsystem
Hamiltonian, by dividing the active space into unentangled active subspaces
each localized to one fragment. We introduce the term localized active space
(LAS) to refer to this kind of wave function. We obtain the LAS wave function
by the DMET algorithm itself self-consistently, and we name this approach the
localized active space self-consistent field (LASSCF) method. LASSCF exploits a
modified DMET algorithm, but it requires no ambiguous error function
minimization, produces a wave function with exact embedding, is variational,
and reproduces CASSCF where comparable DMET calculations fail. Our results for
test calculations on the nitrogen double-bond dissociation potential energy
curves of several diazene molecules suggest that LASSCF can be an appropriate
starting point for a perturbative treatment. Outside of the context of
embedding, LAS is an attractive alternative to a CAS wave function because its
cost scaling is exponential only with respect to the size of individual
fragment active subspaces, rather than the whole active space of the entire
system.

the exposure is continuous rely on restrictive parametric assumptions, which
carry significant risk of model misspecification. Nonparametric estimation in
this context is challenging because in a nonparametric model these curves
cannot be estimated at regular rates. Many available nonparametric estimators
are sensitive to the selection of certain tuning parameters, and performing
valid inference with such estimators can be difficult. In this work, we propose

Specifically, it does not involve tuning parameters, and is invariant to
strictly monotone transformations of the exposure variable. We describe

disease - percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary aortic bypass
graft (CABG) - computational tools may provide a quantitative assessment of
each option. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been used to assess the
interplay between hemodynamics and stent struts; it is of particular interest
in Bioresorbable Vascular Stents (BVS), since their thicker struts may result
in impacted flow patterns and possible pathological consequences. Many proofs
of concept are presented in the literature; however, a practical method for
extracting patient-specific stented coronary artery geometries from images over
a large number of patients remains an open problem.
  This work provides a possible pipeline for the reconstruction of the BVS.
Using Optical Coherence Tomographies (OCT) and Invasive Coronary Angiographies
(ICA), we can reconstruct the 3D geometry of deployed BVS in vivo. We
illustrate the stent reconstruction process: (i) automatic strut detection,
(ii) identification of stent components, (iii) 3D registration of stent
curvature, and (iv) final stent volume reconstruction. The methodology is
designed for use on clinical OCT images, as opposed to approaches that relied
on a small number of virtually deployed stents.
  The proposed reconstruction process is validated with a virtual phantom
stent, providing quantitative assessment of the methodology, and with selected
clinical cases, confirming feasibility. Using multimodality image analysis, we
obtain reliable reconstructions within a reasonable timeframe. This work is the
first step toward a fully automated reconstruction and simulation procedure
aiming at an extensive quantitative analysis of the impact of BVS struts on
hemodynamics via CFD in clinical trials, going beyond the proof-of-concept
stage.

of ultraviolet flare activity is a key concern for the evolution of exoplanet

young and field-age samples. The most energetic flare observed, dubbed the
""Hazflare,"" emitted an energy of $10^{32.1}$ erg in the FUV, 30$\times$ more

emission bright enough to designate it a superflare ($E>10^{33}$ erg), with an

emitted 18$^{+2}_{-1}$% of its flux in the FUV (912--1700 \AA) where molecules

Some of these states correspond to a node being unresponsive to FCs requests.
When a node goes unresponsive for more than a set threshold, FC intervenes and
reboots the node. We minimized the downtime caused by the intervention

customize the organic recovery model to the individual nodes that go unhealthy.
This regression approach allows us to use information about the node like

found to provide indications of potential sites for pitting and material
rupture from single impact events, no additional information could be

granular media. In the discrete element method (DEM) contact friction is
usually modelled with Coulomb's law assuming a constant interparticle friction
coefficient. From tribology it is known that friction is influenced by several
factors, e.g., temperature, normal stress, surface condition, etc. None of
these influences can be modelled with the constant interparticle friction
coefficient from Coulomb's law. For a given granular material (particle shape
distribution), the usage of constant interparticle friction in DEM models
generally results in constant bulk friction coefficients in the simulation of
direct shear tests. While this is frequently seen in experiments with
equi-sized spherical particles, papers exist in literature which report a
stress dependency of bulk friction for non-spherical particles of certain
materials. In this work, a stress dependency of bulk friction is obtained by
introducing a model for stress dependent interparticle friction in DEM
simulations. For validation experimental results of direct shear tests
conducted on single or paired glass beads are used. While the bulk friction of
paired spheres clearly decreases with increasing normal stress, it is nearly
constant for single spheres. DEM simulations with the stress dependent
interparticle friction are in good accordance with the experimental results of
both single and paired spheres. A comparison with simulations, using constant
interparticle friction, clearly shows the advantage of the proposed model.

description of the domain and the action of Hamiltonians for a certain class of
ultraviolet-divergent models in Quantum Field Theory. The method was recently
applied to models where nonrelativistic scalar particles are linearly coupled
to a quantised field, the best known of which is the Nelson model. Since this
approach avoids the use of ultraviolet-cutoffs, there is no need for a
renormalisation procedure. Here, we extend the IBC method to pseudorelativistic
scalar particles that interact with a real bosonic field. We construct the
Hamiltonians for such models via abstract boundary conditions, describing their
action explicitly. In addition, we obtain a detailed characterisation of their
domain and make the connection to renormalisation techniques. As an example, we
apply the method to two relativistic variants of Nelson's model, which have
been renormalised for the first time by J. P. Eckmann and A. D. Sloan in 1970
and 1974, respectively.

the self-dual property of the standard logarithm. Since the focus is on
relatively small samples consisting of those maximum values within each

Although effective, they can be resource-consuming and detection results may be
sensitive to environmental changes. In this paper, we take iris movement as a

systems with long orbital periods of $ \gtrsim 1$ day and low eccentricities of
$\lesssim 0.4$. The feature of these orbital parameters is used to constrain
the evolutionary processes of progenitor binaries and the supernova (SN) kicks
of the second born NSs. Adopting that the mass transfer during primordial
binary evolution is highly non-conservative (rotation-dependent), the formation
of DNS systems involves a double helium star binary phase, the common envelope
(CE) evolution initiates before the first NS formation. During the CE evolution
the binary orbital energy is obviously larger when using a helium star rather
than a NS to expel the donor envelope, this can help explain the formation of
DNS systems with long periods. SN kicks at NS birth can lead to eccentric
orbits and even the disruption of binary systems, the low eccentricities
require that the DNSs receive a small natal kick at the second collapse.
Compared with the overall distribution of orbital parameters for observed DNS
binaries, we propose that the second born NSs in most DNS systems are subject
to small natal kicks with the Maxwellian dispersion velocity of less than $ 80
\,\rm km\,s^{-1} $, which can provide some constraints on the SN explosion
processes. The mass distribution of DNS binaries is also briefly discussed. We
suggest that the rotation-dependent mass transfer mode and our results about SN
kicks should be applied to massive binary evolution and population synthesis
studies.

isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) has been employed to obtain the
respective binding constants Kb and the Gibbs free energy of binding.
MD-simulations with explicit counterions but implicit water demonstrate that
counterion release is the main driving force for the binding of proteins to
strongly charged polyelectrolytes: Patches of positive charges located on the
surface of the protein become a multivalent counterion of the polyelectrolyte
thereby releasing a number of counterions condensed on the polyelectrolyte. The
binding Gibbs free energy due to counterion release is predicted to scale with
the logarithm of the salt concentration in the system which is verified both by
simulations and experiment. In several cases, namely for the interaction of
proteins with linear polyelectrolytes and highly charged hydrophilic dendrimers
the binding constant could be calculated from simulations in very good
approximation. This finding demonstrated that in these cases explicit hydration
effects do not contribute to the Gibbs free energy of binding. The Gibbs free
energy can also be used to predict the kinetics of protein uptake by microgels

unconventional computing architectures for high-performance and low-power
electronic systems, capable of carrying out massively parallel operations at
the edge. One emerging technology, ReRAM, also known to belong in the family of
memristors (memory resistors), is gathering attention due to its attractive
features for logic and in-memory computing; benefits which follow from its
technological attributes, such as nanoscale dimensions, low power operation and
multi-state programming. At the same time, design with CMOS is quickly reaching
its physical and functional limitations, and further research towards novel
logic families, such as Threshold Logic Gates (TLGs) is scoped. TLGs constitute
a logic family known for its high-speed and low power consumption, yet rely on
conventional transistor technology. Introducing memristors enables a more
affordable reconfiguration capability of TLGs. Through this work, we are
introducing a physical implementation of a memristor-based current-mode TLG
(MCMTLG) circuit and validate its design and operation through multiple
experimental setups. We demonstrate 2-input and 3-input MCMTLG configurations
and showcase their reconfiguration capability. This is achieved by varying
memristive weights arbitrarily for shaping the classification decision
boundary, thus showing promise as an alternative hardware-friendly
implementation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Through the employment of
real memristor devices as the equivalent of synaptic weights in TLGs, we are
realizing components that can be used towards an in-silico classifier.

direction for high performance thermoelectric materials. In this work we
investigate thermal transport in hierarchically nanostructured silicon. We
consider the combined presence of nanocrystallinity and nanopores, arranged
under both ordered and randomized positions and sizes, by solving the Boltzmann
transport equation using the Monte Carlo method. We show that nanocrystalline
boundaries degrade the thermal conductivity more drastically when the average
grain size becomes smaller than the average phonon mean free path. The
introduction of pores degrades the thermal conductivity even further. Its
effect, however, is significantly more severe when the pore sizes and positions
are randomized, as randomization results in regions of higher porosity along
the phonon transport direction, which introduce significant thermal resistance.
We show that randomization acts as a large increase in the overall effective
porosity. Using our simulations, we show that existing compact nanocrystalline
and nanoporous theoretical models describe thermal conductivity accurately
under uniform nanostructured conditions, but overestimate it in randomized
geometries. We propose extensions to these models that accurately predict the
thermal conductivity of randomized nanoporous materials based solely on a few
geometrical features. Finally, we show that the new compact models introduced
can be used within Matthiessens rule to combine scattering from different
geometrical features within approximately 10 per cent accuracy.

(LVDGs) is the three phase Weighted Least Squares (WLS) State Estimation (SE),
which was initially developed for Medium Voltage Distribution Grids (MVDGs).
This methodology is implicitly applied in LVDGs with an assumption that the
neutral conductor represents a zero potential across the whole system. However,
this assumption is often not valid for LVDGs as the consumers loads are highly
asymmetrical and the neutral conductor is usually grounded only at the MV-LV
transformer substation. Therefore, if this method is applied for the monitoring
of LVDGs it may deteriorate the performance of the WLS SE leading to inaccurate
results. In this paper, an investigation is initially conducted in order to
evaluate the performance of the conventional WLS SE methodology when applied
for the monitoring of LVDGs. The results of this study indicate that the
performance of this methodology is not consistent and is highly affected by the
operating conditions of the LVDG. In view of these results, a new methodology
is proposed and developed that takes into consideration the effect of the
neutral conductor and as a result an outstanding performance is achieved

interesting sub-class of the GRB family, since their luminosity is on average
lower than that of their cosmological analogs. We aim to contribute to the
study of local bursts by reporting the case of GRB 171205A. This source was
discovered by Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on 2017, December 5 and soon
associated with a low redshift host galaxy (z=0.037), and an emerging SN (SN
2017iuk). We analyzed the full Swift, dataset, comprising the UV-Optical
Telescope (UVOT), X-ray Telescope (XRT) and BAT data. In addition, we employed
the Konus-Wind high energy data as a valuable extension at gamma-ray energies.
The photometric SN signature is clearly visible in the UVOT u, b and v filters.
The maximum emission is reached at ~ 13 (rest frame) days, and the whole bump
resembles that of SN 2006aj, but lower in magnitude and with a shift in time of
+2 d. A prebump in the v-band is also clearly visible, and this is the first
time that such a feature is not observed achromatically in GRB-SNe. Its
physical origin cannot be easily explained. The X-ray spectrum shows an
intrinsic Hydrogen column density N_H,int = 7.4(+4.1 -3.6) X 10^20 / cm^2$,
which is at the low end of the N_H,int, even considering just low redshift
GRBs. The spectrum also features a thermal component, which is quite common in
GRBs associated with SNe, but whose origin is still a matter of debate.
Finally, the isotropic energy in the gamma-ray band, E_iso = 2.18(+0.63 -0.50)
X 10^49 erg, is lower than those of cosmological GRBs. Combining this value
with the peak energy in the same band, E_p=125(+141 -37) keV, implies that GRB
171205A is an outlier of the Amati relation, as are some other low redshift
GRBs, and its emission mechanism should be different from that of canonical,
farther away GRBs.

ensure and quantify support recovery, since it preserves the invariance of the
problem under reparameterization. We prove that under mild regularity and
curvature conditions, stable support identification is achieved even in the
presence of randomized sub-sampled observations (which is the case in
compressed sensing or learning scenario). On deconvolution problems, which are
translation invariant, this generalizes to the multi-dimensional setting
existing results of the literature. For more complex translation-varying

better understanding of the dynamics of dense crowds. Inquiring into the
possibility of a mechanical description of these dynamics, we experimentally
study the crossing of dense static crowds by a cylindrical intruder, a
mechanical test which is classical for granular matter. The analysis of our
experiments reveals robust features in the crowds' response, comprising both
similarities and discrepancies with the response of granular media. Common
features include the presence of a depleted region behind the intruder and the
short-range character of the perturbation. On the other hand, unlike grains,
pedestrians anticipate the intruder's passage by moving much before contact and
their displacements are mostly lateral, hence not aligned with the forces
exerted by the intruder. Similar conclusions are reached when the intruder is
not a cylinder, but a single crossing pedestrian. Thus, our work shows that
pedestrian interactions even at high densities (3 to 6 ped/m 2) do not reduce
to mechanical ones. More generally, the avoidance strategies evidenced by our
findings question the incautious use of force models for dense crowds.

the LSS in the gravitational lensing analysis of CMB has been recently
recognized by several works, while its impact on delensing is not yet explored.
The delensing using mass-tracers such as galaxies and cosmic infrared
background (CIB) could be also affected by the nonlinear growth. We find that
the nonlinear growth of the LSS leads to $\sim 0.3\%$ corrections to $B$-mode
spectrum after delensing with a high-$z$ mass tracer ($z_m\sim 2$) at
$\ell=1000$-$2000$. The off-diagonal correlation coefficients of the lensing
$B$-mode template spectrum become significant for delensing with low-$z$
tracers ($z_m\lesssim 0.5$), but are negligible with high-$z$ tracers (such as
CIB). On the other hand, the power spectrum covariance of the delensed $B$ mode
is not significantly affected by the nonlinear growth of the LSS, and the
delensing efficiency is not significantly changed even if we use low-$z$
tracers. The CMB $B$-mode internal delensing is also not significantly affected

method to analytically solve the linearized BCS gap equation for a large class
of finite-range interaction potentials leading to s-wave superconductivity.
With this analysis, we demonstrate that the monotonic growth of the
superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ with the carrier density, $n$,
predicted by standard BCS theory, is an artifact of the simplifying assumption
that the interaction is quasi-local. In contrast, we show that any well-defined
non-local potential leads to a ""superconducting dome"", i.e. a non-monotonic
$T_c(n)$ exhibiting a maximum value at finite doping and going to zero for
large $n$. This proves that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the presence of a
superconducting dome is not necessarily an indication of competing orders, nor
of exotic superconductivity. Our results provide a prototype example and guide
towards improving ab-initio predictions of $T_c$ for real materials.

Change of amplitude, phase and polarization can be addressed within a thickness

other unique features like that of analog computing have also been identified.
With this huge potential ready to be disclosed, lack of tunability is still a

able to modify and memorize their state, possibly with a small amount of
energy. In this Communication we report low-energy, self-holding metasurface
reconfiguration through lithium intercalation in a vanadium pentoxide layer
integrated within the photonic device. By a proper meta-atom design, operation
on amplitude and phase of linearly polarized light has been demonstrated. In
addition, manipulation of circularly polarized light in the form of tunable
chirality and tunable handedness-preserving reflection has been implemented.
These operations are accomplished using as low as 50 pJ/{\mu}m^{2}, raising
lithium intercalation in transition metal oxides as one of the most energy

  2018",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spontaneous spoken dialogue is often disfluent, containing pauses,
hesitations, self-corrections and false starts. Processing such phenomena is
essential in understanding a speaker's intended meaning and controlling the
flow of the conversation. Furthermore, this processing needs to be word-by-word
incremental to allow further downstream processing to begin as early as
possible in order to handle real spontaneous human conversational behaviour.
  In addition, from a developer's point of view, it is highly desirable to be
able to develop systems which can be trained from `clean' examples while also
able to generalise to the very diverse disfluent variations on the same data --
thereby enhancing both data-efficiency and robustness. In this paper, we
present a multi-task LSTM-based model for incremental detection of disfluency
structure, which can be hooked up to any component for incremental
interpretation (e.g. an incremental semantic parser), or else simply used to
`clean up' the current utterance as it is being produced.
  We train the system on the Switchboard Dialogue Acts (SWDA) corpus and
present its accuracy on this dataset. Our model outperforms prior neural
network-based incremental approaches by about 10 percentage points on SWDA
while employing a simpler architecture. To test the model's generalisation
potential, we evaluate the same model on the bAbI+ dataset, without any
additional training. bAbI+ is a dataset of synthesised goal-oriented dialogues
where we control the distribution of disfluencies and their types. This shows
that our approach has good generalisation potential, and sheds more light on
which types of disfluency might be amenable to domain-general processing.

important role in the evolution and dispersal of planet-forming disks. We
report the first high-resolution ($\Delta v\sim$6\kms) analysis of [S II]
$\lambda$4068, [O I] $\lambda$5577, and [O I] $\lambda$6300 lines from a sample
of 48 T Tauri stars. Following Simon et al. (2016), we decompose them into
three kinematic components: a high-velocity component (HVC) associated with
jets, and a low-velocity narrow (LVC-NC) and broad (LVC-BC) components. We
confirm previous findings that many LVCs are blueshifted by more than 1.5
kms$^{-1}$ thus most likely trace a slow disk wind. We further show that the
profiles of individual components are similar in the three lines. We find that
most LVC-BC and NC line ratios are explained by thermally excited gas with
temperatures between 5,000$-$10,000 K and electron densities
$\sim10^{7}-10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$. The HVC ratios are better reproduced by shock
models with a pre-shock H number density of $\sim10^{6}-10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$.
Using these physical properties, we estimate $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}/\dot{M}_{\rm
acc}$ for the LVC and $\dot{M}_{\rm jet}/\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ for the HVC. In
agreement with previous work, the mass carried out in jets is modest compared
to the accretion rate. With the likely assumption that the NC wind height is
larger than the BC, the LVC-BC $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}/\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ is found
to be higher than the LVC-NC. These results suggest that most of the mass loss
occurs close to the central star, within a few au, through an MHD driven wind.
Depending on the wind height, MHD winds might play a major role in the
evolution of the disk mass.

the analysis of atomistic data. Descriptors of the local atomic environment
ideally provide physically and chemically intuitive insight. This requires
descriptors that are low-dimensional representations of the interplay between
atomic geometry and electronic bond formation. The moments of the local density
of states (DOS) relate the atomic structure to the electronic structure and
bond chemistry. This makes it possible to construct electronic structure based
descriptors of the local atomic environment that have an immediate relation to
the binding energy. We show that a low-dimensional moments-descriptor is
sufficient as the lowest moments, calculated from the closest atomic
neighborhood, carry the largest contributions to the local bond energy. Here,
we construct moments-descriptors that project the space of local atomic
environments on a 2-D map. We discuss in detail the separation of various
atomic environments and their connections in the map. The distances in the map
may be related to energy differences between local atomic environments as we
show by analytic considerations based on analytic bond-order potentials (BOP)
and by numerical assessment using TB and density-functional theory
calculations. Possible applications of the proposed moments-descriptors include
the classification of local atomic environments in molecular-dynamic
simulations, the selection of structure sets for developing and testing
interatomic potentials, as well as the construction of descriptors for
machine-learning applications.

identical for networks with same dimensions. In this work, we approximate the

to sample the activation patterns defined by ReLUs using universal hash

MILP solution sets that we call MIPBound, which is considerably faster than
exact counting and reaches values in similar orders of magnitude. Our second

deformable double-porous structure described at two characteristic scales. The
higher level porosity associated with the mesoscopic structure is constituted
by channels in a matrix made of a microporous material consisting of elastic
skeleton and pores saturated by a viscous fluid. The macroscopic model is
derived by the homogenization of the flow in the heterogeneous structure
characterized by two small parameters involved in the two-level asymptotic
analysis, whereby a scaling ansatz is adopted to respect the pore size
differences. The first level upscaling of the fluid-structure interaction
problem yields a Biot continuum describing the mesoscopic matrix coupled with
the Stokes flow in the channels. The second step of the homogenization leads to
a macroscopic model involving three equations for displacements, the mesoscopic
flow velocity and the micropore pressure. Due to interactions between the two
porosities, the macroscopic flow is governed by a Darcy-Brinkman model
comprising two equations which are coupled with the overall equilibrium
equation respecting the hierarchical structure of the two-phase medium.
Expressions of the effective macroscopic parameters of the homogenized
double-porosity continuum are derived, depending on the characteristic
responses of the mesoscopic structure. Some symmetry and reciprocity
relationships are shown and issues of boundary conditions are discussed. The
model has been implemented in the finite element code SfePy which is
well-suited for computational homogenization. A numerical example of solving a

candidate for computing at high bitrates (> 10 Gbps) and with low energy
consumption. Currently though, both benefits are limited by the necessity to
perform training and readout operations in the electrical domain. Thus, efforts
are currently underway in the photonic community to design an integrated

In addition to the technological challenge of designing such a readout, new

Gaussian density matrices with parameters which obey self-consistent equations
of motion, thus extending the applicability of real-time simulations beyond the
classical limit. Initial values of these Gaussian density matrices are
optimized to be as close as possible to the thermal equilibrium state of the
system. Thus attempting to bridge between the low-energy regime with a
calculable holographic description and the classical regime at high energies,
we find that quantum corrections to classical dynamics tend to decrease the
Lyapunov exponents, which is essential for consistency with the
Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound at low temperatures. The entanglement
entropy is found to exhibit an expected ""scrambling"" behavior - rapid initial
growth followed by saturation. At least at high temperatures the entanglement
saturation time appears to be governed by classical Lyapunov exponents. Decay
of quasinormal modes is found to be characterized by the shortest time scale of
all. We also find that while the bosonic matrix model becomes non-chaotic in
the low-temperature regime, for the full BFSS model with fermions the leading
Lyapunov exponent, entanglement saturation time, and decay rate of quasinormal

planetary migration and form gas giants there. These growing planets undergo
accretion heating, which triggers a hot-trail effect that can reverse migration
directions, increase eccentricities and prevent resonant captures (Chrenko et
al. 2017). We study populations of embryos accreting pebbles using Fargo-Thorin
2D hydrocode.
  We find that embryos in a disk with high surface density ($\Sigma_0 =
990\,{\rm g}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$) undergo `unsuccessful' two-body encounters which
do not lead to a merger. Only when a 3rd protoplanet arrives to the convergence
zone, three-body encounters lead to mergers. For a low-viscosity disk ($\nu =
5\times10^{13}\,{\rm cm}^2\,{\rm s}^{-1}$) a massive coorbital is a possible
outcome, for which a pebble isolation develops and the coorbital is stabilised.
For more massive protoplanets ($5\,M_\oplus$), the convergence radius is
located further out, in the ice-giant zone. After a series of encounters, there
is an evolution driven by a dynamical torque of a tadpole region, which is
systematically repeated several times, until the coorbital configuration is
disrupted and planets merge. This may be a pathway how to solve the problem
that coorbitals often form in simulations but they are not observed in nature.
  In contrast, the joint evolution of 120 low-mass protoplanets
($0.1\,M_\oplus$) reveals completely different dynamics. The evolution is no
longer smooth, but rather a random walk. This is because the spiral arms,
developed in the gas disk due to Lindblad resonances, overlap with each other
and affect not only a single protoplanet but several in the surroundings. Our
hydrodynamical simulations may have important implications for N-body
simulations of planetary migration that use simplified torque prescriptions and
are thus unable to capture protoplanet dynamics in its full glory.

perceptrons in machine learning for the purpose of boosting the robustness of
classifiers toward a good generalization ability. Yet Breiman (1999) showed a
dilemma that a uniform improvement on margin distribution does NOT necessarily
reduces generalization errors. In this paper, we revisit Breiman's dilemma in
deep neural networks with recently proposed spectrally normalized margins, from
a novel perspective based on phase transitions of normalized margin
distributions in training dynamics. Normalized margin distribution of a
classifier over the data, can be divided into two parts: low/small margins such
as some negative margins for misclassified samples vs. high/large margins for
high confident correctly classified samples, that often behave differently
during the training process. Low margins for training and test datasets are
often effectively reduced in training, along with reductions of training and
test errors; while high margins may exhibit different dynamics, reflecting the
trade-off between expressive power of models and complexity of data. When data
complexity is comparable to the model expressiveness, high margin distributions
for both training and test data undergo similar decrease-increase phase
transitions during training. In such cases, one can predict the trend of
generalization or test error by margin-based generalization bounds with
restricted Rademacher complexities, shown in two ways in this paper with early
stopping time exploiting such phase transitions. On the other hand,
over-expressive models may have both low and high training margins undergoing
uniform improvements, with a distinct phase transition in test margin dynamics.
This reconfirms the Breiman's dilemma associated with overparameterized neural
networks where margins fail to predict overfitting.

distinguishing between models for the formation and growth of supermassive
black holes, the evolution of quasars, and their potential feedback effects on
their host galaxies. However, this critical timescale, often referred to as the
quasar lifetime, is still uncertain by orders of magnitude ($t_{\rm Q} \simeq
0.01\,{\rm Myr} - 1\,{\rm Gyr}$). Absorption spectra of quasars exhibiting
transmission in the He II Ly$\alpha$ forest provide a unique opportunity to
make precise measurements of the quasar lifetime. Indeed, the size of a
quasar's He II proximity zone, the region near the quasar itself where its own
radiation dramatically alters the ionization state of the surrounding
intergalactic medium (IGM), depends sensitively on its lifetime for $t_{\rm
Q}\lesssim 30$ Myr, comparable to the expected $e$-folding time-scale for SMBH
growth $t_{\rm S}=45$ Myr. In this study we compare the sizes of He II
proximity zones in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectra of 6 z~4 quasars to
theoretical models generated by post-processing cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations with $1$D radiative transfer algorithm. We introduce a Bayesian
statistical method to infer the lifetimes of individual quasars which allows us
to fully marginalize over the unknown ionization state of the surrounding IGM.
We measure lifetimes $0.63^{+0.82}_{-0.40}$ Myr and $5.75^{+4.72}_{-2.74}$ Myr
for two objects. For the other 4 quasars large redshift uncertainties undermine
our sensitivity allowing us to only place upper or lower limits. However a
joint analysis of these four systems yields a measurement of their average
lifetime of $\langle t_{\rm Q}\rangle = 1.17^{+1.77}_{-0.84}$ Myr. We discuss
our short ~1 Myr inferred lifetimes in the context of other quasar lifetime
constraints and the growth of SMBHs.

structures. Thiagarajan (1996 and 2002) conjectured that regular event
structures correspond exactly to trace regular event structures. In a recent
paper (Chalopin and Chepoi, 2017, 2018), we disproved this conjecture, based on
the striking bijection between domains of event structures, median graphs, and
CAT(0) cube complexes. On the other hand, in Chalopin and Chepoi (2018) we
proved that Thiagarajan's conjecture is true for regular event structures whose
domains are principal filters of universal covers of (virtually) finite special
cube complexes.
  In the current paper, we prove the converse: to any finite 1-safe Petri net
$N$ one can associate a finite special cube complex ${X}_N$ such that the
domain of the event structure $\mathcal{E}_N$ (obtained as the unfolding of
$N$) is a principal filter of the universal cover $\widetilde{X}_N$ of $X_N$.
This establishes a bijection between 1-safe Petri nets and finite special cube
complexes and provides a combinatorial characterization of trace regular event
structures.
  Using this bijection and techniques from graph theory and geometry (MSO
theory of graphs, bounded treewidth, and bounded hyperbolicity) we disprove yet
another conjecture by Thiagarajan (from the paper with S. Yang from 2014) that
the monadic second order logic of a 1-safe Petri net is decidable if and only
if its unfolding is grid-free.
  Our counterexample is the trace regular event structure $\mathcal{\dot E}_Z$
which arises from a virtually special square complex $\dot Z$. The domain of
$\mathcal{\dot E}_Z$ is grid-free (because it is hyperbolic), but the MSO
theory of the event structure $\mathcal{\dot E}_Z$ is undecidable.

Standard model calibration routines rely on the repetitive evaluation of the
map from model parameters to Black-Scholes implied volatility, rendering
calibration of many (rough) stochastic volatility models prohibitively
expensive since there the map can often only be approximated by costly Monte

cheap forward runs of a neural network trained to approximate the implied

our approach.

inverted in $\pi$. A set of vertices $D$ is said to dominate a graph $G$ when
every vertex in $G$ is either an element of $D$, or adjacent to an element of
$D$. The domination number $\gamma(G)$ is defined as the cardinality of a
minimum dominating set of $G$. A strong fixed point of a permutation $\pi$ of
order $n$ is an element $k$ such that $\pi^{-1}(j)<\pi^{-1}(k)$ for all $j<k$,
and $\pi^{-1}(i)>\pi^{-1}(k)$ for all $i>k$. In this article, we count the
number of connected permutation graphs on $n$ vertices with domination number
$1$ and domination number $\frac{n}{2}$. We further show that for a natural
number $k\leq \frac{n}{2}$, there exists a connected permutation graph on $n$
vertices with domination number $k$. We find a closed expression for the number
of permutation graphs dominated by a set with two elements, and we find a
closed expression for the number of permutation graphs efficiently dominated by
any set of vertices. We conclude by providing an application of these results
to strong fixed points, proving some conjectures posed on the OEIS.

describing the same contents in various ways. Hence, it is highly expected to
learn effective joint representation by fusing the features of different
modalities. However, previous methods mainly focus on fusing the shallow
features or high-level representations generated by unimodal deep networks,
which only capture part of the hierarchical correlations across modalities. In
this paper, we propose to densely integrate the representations by greedily
stacking multiple shared layers between different modality-specific networks,
which is named as Dense Multimodal Fusion (DMF). The joint representations in
different shared layers can capture the correlations in different levels, and
the connection between shared layers also provides an efficient way to learn
the dependence among hierarchical correlations. These two properties jointly
contribute to the multiple learning paths in DMF, which results in faster
convergence, lower training loss, and better performance. We evaluate our model
on three typical multimodal learning tasks, including audiovisual speech
recognition, cross-modal retrieval, and multimodal classification. The
noticeable performance in the experiments demonstrates that our model can learn
more effective joint representation.

retardation, atomism, or contributions of collective mechanical vibrations

nontrivial ways. We present a theoretical framework for computing
electromagnetic interactions among molecular structures, accounting for their

dissipation, and phonons at atomic scales, along with long-range
electromagnetic interactions among themselves or in the vicinity of continuous
macroscopic bodies. We find that in carbon allotropes, particularly fullerenes,
carbyne wires, and graphene sheets, phonons can couple strongly with long-range
electromagnetic fields, especially at mesoscopic scales (nanometers), to create
delocalized phonon polaritons that significantly modify the infrared molecular
response. These polaritons especially depend on the molecular dimensionality

bodies above a macroscopic gold surface, producing nonmonotonic power laws and
nontrivial temperature variations at nanometer separations that are within the

i.e. the way we want to find similarity, some methods are based on distance

Understanding prominent segment of data is always challenging as multidimension
space does not allow us to have a look and feel of the distance or any visual
context on the health of the clustering.
  While explaining data using clusters, the major problem is to tell how many
cluster are good enough to explain the data. Generally basic descriptive
statistics are used to estimate cluster behaviour like scree plot, dendrogram
etc. We propose a novel method to understand the cluster behaviour which can be
used not only to find right number of clusters but can also be used to access
the difference of health between different clustering methods on same data. Our
technique would also help to also eliminate the noisy variables and optimize

multivariate models based on families of variables. The crucial relation of
conditional independence between frames of a f.c.f is introduced and shown to
form a quasi-separoid, a weakening of the well-known structure of a separoid.
It is shown that PAS generate probability potentials on the frames of the
f.c.f. The operations of aggregating different PAS and of transport of a PAS
from one frame to another induce an algebraic structure on the family of
potentials on the f.c.f, an algebraic structure which is similar to valuation
algebras related to Bayesian networks, but more general. As a consequence the
well-known local computation architectures of Bayesian networks for inference
apply also for the potentials on f.c.f. Conditioning and conditionals can be
defined for potentials and it is shown that these concepts satisfy similar

well-posedness is to go from the Eulerian to a Lagrangian
description.Geometrically it corresponds to a geodesic initial value problem on
the infinite-dimensional group of diffeomorphisms with a right invariant
Riemannian metric. By establishing regularity properties of the Riemannian
spray one can then obtain local, and sometimes global, existence and uniqueness
results. There are, however, many hydrodynamic-type equations, notably shallow
water models and compressible Euler equations, where the underlying
infinite-dimensional Riemannian structure is not fully right invariant, but
still semi-invariant with respect to the subgroup of volume preserving

Sobolev $H^k$-type we give local and some global well-posedness results for the

the sources. While in some spectra such breaks are not seen, hardenings at
distance-dependent energies are present in many of them, though the overall
statistical significance of the effect is lower than reported in previous
studies. The dependence of the break strength on the redshift found earlier is

between the insertion loss and the amplitude or phase modulation depth. Here it
is shown that every switching optical device is subject to such a tradeoff,
intrinsically connected to the dielectric response of the materials employed
inside the switching element itself. This limit finds its roots in fundamental
physics, as it directly derives from Maxwell's equations for linear

point out that the peak is contributed mainly by the coupling form factor,
which comes from the convolution of the interaction term and meson wave

magnetic moment, due to the suppression of the dead layer at the interface with
Ta, but the perpendicular anisotropy is hardly affected. All samples show a
universal scaling of the field-driven domain wall velocity across the creep and
depinning regimes. Asymmetric bubble expansion shows that DWs in all of the
samples have the left-handed N\'{e}el form. The value of in-plane field at
which the creep velocity shows a minimum drops markedly on the introduction of
Ir, as does the frequency shift of the Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks in
Brillouin light scattering measurements. Despite this qualitative similarity,
there are quantitative differences in the DMI strength given by the two
measurements, with BLS often returning higher values. Many features in bubble
expansion velocity curves do not fit simple models commonly used to date,
namely a lack of symmetry about the velocity minimum and no difference in
velocities at high in-plane field. These features are explained by the use of a
model in which the depinning field is allowed to vary with in-plane field in a
way determined from micromagnetic simulations. This theory shows that velocity
minimum underestimates the DMI field, consistent with BLS returning higher

coordinates of a dynamical system into a resolved coarse-scale set and an
unresolved fine-scale set. A Markovian finite memory assumption within the
Mori-Zwanzig formalism is then used to develop a reduced-order representation
of the coarse-scales. This procedure leads to a closed reduced-order model that
displays commonalities with the adjoint stabilization method used in finite

with a non-linear, time-varying test basis, thus sharing some similarities with
the least-squares Petrov-Galerkin method. Theoretical analysis examining a
priori error bounds and computational cost is presented. Numerical experiments
on the compressible Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate that the proposed
method can lead to improvements in numerical accuracy, robustness, and
computational efficiency over the Galerkin method on problems of practical
interest. Improvements in numerical accuracy and computational efficiency over

relative volume change with respect to the experimental volume ($\frac{\Delta

bi-quadratic and the direct Dyzaloshinski-Moriya (DM) interactions and find how
these coupling constants vary under the volume change. Then we study the effect
of volume change on the finite temperature critical behavior, using classical
Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. We show that the spin system undergoes a weakly
first order transition to AIAO at small volumes which turns to a second order
transition close to the experimental structure. However, increasing

of deep neural networks (DNN), as this knowledge enhances an adversary's
capability to conduct black-box attacks against the model. This paper presents
the first in-depth security analysis of DNN fingerprinting attacks that exploit
cache side-channels. First, we define the threat model for these attacks: our
adversary does not need the ability to query the victim model; instead, she
runs a co-located process on the host machine victim's deep learning (DL)
system is running and passively monitors the accesses of the target functions
in the shared framework. Second, we introduce DeepRecon, an attack that
reconstructs the architecture of the victim network by using the internal
information extracted via Flush+Reload, a cache side-channel technique. Once
the attacker observes function invocations that map directly to architecture
attributes of the victim network, the attacker can reconstruct the victim's
entire network architecture. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that an attacker
can accurately reconstruct two complex networks (VGG19 and ResNet50) having
observed only one forward propagation. Based on the extracted architecture
attributes, we also demonstrate that an attacker can build a meta-model that
accurately fingerprints the architecture and family of the pre-trained model in
a transfer learning setting. From this meta-model, we evaluate the importance
of the observed attributes in the fingerprinting process. Third, we propose and
evaluate new framework-level defense techniques that obfuscate our attacker's
observations. Our empirical security analysis represents a step toward
understanding the DNNs' vulnerability to cache side-channel attacks.

information of the central region of the configuration from leaking. Since
information cannot propagate faster than the speed of light, we identify the
threshold of the black hole formation by considering the finite speed for
propagation of information. We show that the production probability
$\beta_{inhom}(\sigma)$ of primordial black holes, where $\sigma$ is density
fluctuation at horizon entry, is significantly enhanced from that derived in
previous work in which the speed of propagation was effectively regarded as
infinite. For $\sigma \ll 1$, we obtain $\beta_{inhom}\simeq 3.70

considered. Its existence in this reaction is not necessarily connected to the
existence of a dynamically generated pole, but the underlying mechanism - the
strong coupling of $c\bar{c}$ to \ $DD^{\ast}$ loops - can generate both of
them. Thus, the controversial state $Y(4008)$ may not be a genuine resonance,

We use a homogeneous Poisson-Voronoi tessellation (PVT) model of streets with
homogeneous Poisson users (devices) on its edges and independent Bernoulli
relays on the vertices. Using this model, we demonstrated the existence of a
minimal threshold for relays below which large-scale connectivity of the
network is not possible, regardless of all other network parameters. Through
simulations, we estimated this threshold to 71.3%. Moreover, if the mean street
length is not larger than some threshold (predicted to 74.3% of the
communication range; which might be the case in a typical urban scenario) then
any (whatever small) density of users can be compensated by equipping more
crossroads with relays. Above this latter threshold, good connectivity requires
some minimal density of users, compensated by the relays in a way we make
explicit. The existence of the above regimes brings interesting qualitative
arguments to the discussion on the possible D2D deployment scenarios.

temperature normal state magnetoresistance (MR) of the n-type cuprate system
La2-xCexCuO4 (LCCO) and find that it is characterized by a linear-in-field
behavior, which follows a scaling relation with applied field and temperature,
for doping (x) above the putative QCP (x= 0.14)(5). This unconventional
behavior suggests that magnetic fields probe the same physics that gives rise
to the anomalous low-temperature linear-in-T resistivity(4). The magnitude of
the linear MR decreases as Tc decreases and goes to zero at the end of the
superconducting dome (x ~0.175) above which a conventional quadratic MR is
found. These results show that there is a strong correlation between the
quantum critical excitations of the strange metal state and the high-Tc
superconductivity.

framework for growing geometries and its application to metal additive
manufacturing. It is well-known that virtual part design and qualification in
additive manufacturing requires highly-accurate multiscale and multiphysics
analyses. Only high performance computing tools are able to handle such
complexity in time frames compatible with time-to-market. However, efficiency,
without loss of accuracy, has rarely held the centre stage in the numerical
community. Here, in contrast, the framework is designed to adequately exploit
the resources of high-end distributed-memory machines. It is grounded on three
building blocks: (1) Hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement with octree-based
meshes; (2) a parallel strategy to model the growth of the geometry; (3)
state-of-the-art parallel iterative linear solvers. Computational experiments
consider the heat transfer analysis at the part scale of the printing process
by powder-bed technologies. After verification against a 3D benchmark, a
strong-scaling analysis assesses performance and identifies major sources of
parallel overhead. A third numerical example examines the efficiency and
robustness of (2) in a curved 3D shape. Unprecedented parallelism and
scalability were achieved in this work. Hence, this framework contributes to
take on higher complexity and/or accuracy, not only of part-scale simulations
of metal or polymer additive manufacturing, but also in welding, sedimentation,
atherosclerosis, or any other physical problem where the physical domain of
interest grows in time.

way to send information to covert receiver Bob without watchful and capable
adversary Willie being able to detect the presence of the message. In our
previous works, we addressed two techniques for such covert transmission from
Alice to Bob: packet insertion and packet timing. In this paper, we consider
covert communication via bit insertion in packets with available space (e.g.,
with size less than the maximum transmission unit). We consider three
scenarios: 1) packet sizes are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
with a probability mass function (pmf) whose support is a set of one bit spaced
values; 2) packet sizes are i.i.d. with a pmf whose support is arbitrary; 3)
packet sizes may be dependent. For the first and second assumptions, we show
that Alice can covertly insert $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ bits of information in a
flow of $n$ packets; conversely, if she inserts $\omega(\sqrt{n})$ bits of
information, Willie can detect her with arbitrarily small error probability.
For the third assumption, we prove Alice can covertly insert on average
$\mathcal{O}(c(n)/\sqrt{n})$ bits in a sequence of $n$ packets, where $c(n)$ is
the average number of conditional pmf of packet sizes given the history, with a
support of at least size two.

algorithms for fundamental problems such as leader election, broadcast,
spanning tree (ST), minimum spanning tree (MST), minimum cut, and many graph
verification problems. We consider the synchronous CONGEST distributed
computing model and assume that each node has initial knowledge of itself and
the identifiers of its neighbors - the so-called KT1 model - a well-studied
model that also naturally arises in many applications. Recently, it has been
established that one can obtain (almost) singularly optimal algorithms, i.e.,
algorithms that have simultaneously optimal time and message complexity (up to
polylogarithmic factors), for many fundamental problems in the standard KT0
model (where nodes have only local knowledge of themselves and not their
neighbors). The situation is less clear in the KT1 model. In this paper, we
present several new distributed algorithms in the KT1 model that trade off
between time and message complexity.
  Our distributed algorithms are based on a uniform approach which involves
constructing a sparsified spanning subgraph of the original graph - called a
danner - that trades off the number of edges with the diameter of the
sparsifier. In particular, a key ingredient of our approach is a distributed
randomized algorithm that, given a graph G and any delta in [0, 1], with high
probability constructs a danner that has diameter Otilde(D + n^(1 - delta)) and
Otilde(min{m, n^(1 + delta)}) edges in Otilde(n^(1 - delta)) rounds while using
Otilde(min{m, n^(1 + delta)}) messages, where n, m, and D are the number of
nodes, edges, and the diameter of G, respectively. Using our danner
construction, we present a family of distributed randomized algorithms for
various fundamental problems that exhibit a trade-off between message and time
complexity and that improve over previous results.

takes. Therefore, exploration can lead to collisions with the potential to harm
the robot and/or the environment. In this work we address the safety aspect by
constraining the exploration to happen in safe-to-explore state spaces. These
are formed by decomposing target skills (e.g., grasping) into higher ranked
sub-tasks (e.g., collision avoidance, joint limit avoidance) and lower ranked
movement tasks (e.g., reaching). Sub-tasks are defined as concurrent
controllers (policies) in different operational spaces together with associated
Jacobians representing their joint-space mapping. Safety is ensured by only
learning policies corresponding to lower ranked sub-tasks in the redundant null
space of higher ranked ones. As a side benefit, learning in sub-manifolds of
the state-space also facilitates sample efficiency. Reaching skills performed
in simulation and grasping skills performed on a real robot validate the
usefulness of the proposed approach.

that the orbit averaged method breaks down in the late inspiral, failing to
capture a strong secular growth in the Keplerian eccentricity parameter and
producing a orbital de-phasing relative to direct integration of the two-body
equations of motion. We show that the secular growth and de-phasing affect the
observed gravitational wave signal, which could bias how accurately we may
recover parameters for systems with signal-to-noise ratios $\gtrsim 100$. We
further develop a frequency domain post-adiabatic waveform model to capture
these effects, and study the precision to which we may estimate parameters with
this model through a Fisher information matrix analysis.

architecture search (NAS). NSGA-Net is designed with three goals in mind: (1) a
procedure considering multiple and conflicting objectives, (2) an efficient
procedure balancing exploration and exploitation of the space of potential
neural network architectures, and (3) a procedure finding a diverse set of
trade-off network architectures achieved in a single run. NSGA-Net is a
population-based search algorithm that explores a space of potential neural
network architectures in three steps, namely, a population initialization step
that is based on prior-knowledge from hand-crafted architectures, an
exploration step comprising crossover and mutation of architectures, and
finally an exploitation step that utilizes the hidden useful knowledge stored
in the entire history of evaluated neural architectures in the form of a
Bayesian Network. Experimental results suggest that combining the dual
objectives of minimizing an error metric and computational complexity, as
measured by FLOPs, allows NSGA-Net to find competitive neural architectures.
Moreover, NSGA-Net achieves error rate on the CIFAR-10 dataset on par with
other state-of-the-art NAS methods while using orders of magnitude less
computational resources. These results are encouraging and shows the promise to
further use of EC methods in various deep-learning paradigms.

representations. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, which leverages
two classic representation learning paradigms, i.e., sparse representation and
the trace quotient criterion. The former is a well-known powerful tool to
identify underlying self-explanatory factors of data, while the latter is known
for disentangling underlying low dimensional discriminative factors in data.
Our developed solutions disentangle sparse representations of images by
employing the trace quotient criterion. We construct a unified cost function,
coined as the SPARse LOW dimensional representation (SparLow) function, for
jointly learning both a sparsifying dictionary and a dimensionality reduction
transformation. The SparLow function is widely applicable for developing
various algorithms in three classic machine learning scenarios, namely,
unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised learning. In order to develop
efficient joint learning algorithms for maximizing the SparLow function, we
deploy a framework of sparse coding with appropriate convex priors to ensure
the sparse representations to be locally differentiable. Moreover, we develop
an efficient geometric conjugate gradient algorithm to maximize the SparLow
function on its underlying Riemannian manifold. Performance of the proposed
SparLow algorithmic framework is investigated on several image processing
tasks, such as 3D data visualization, face/digit recognition, and object/scene
categorization.

they claim that Gaia DR2 parallax measurements show the geometric calibration
of the Cepheid distance scale used to measure H0 to be grossly in error and B)
that we live near the middle of an enormous void, further biasing the local
measurement of the Hubble constant. We show that the first claim is caused by
five erroneous uses of the data: in decreasing order of importance: 1) the use
of a distance indicator, main sequence fitting of cluster stars, which is
unrelated to the calibration of Cepheids and therefore has no bearing on
current measurements of H0; 2) the use of Gaia data for Cepheids that fully
saturate the detector, producing unreliable parallaxes; 3) the use of a fixed
parallax offset which is known to depend on source magnitude and color but
which is derived for sources with extremely different colors and magnitudes; 4)
ignoring the uncertainty in this offset; and 5) ignoring the other geometric
sources of Cepheid calibration, the distance of the LMC from detached eclipsing
binaries and the masers in NGC 4258, which are independent of Milky Way
parallaxes. Just resolving the first two of these issues by not using unrelated
or saturated data leads to no inconsistency between Gaia parallaxes and the
current Cepheid distance scale. The second claim can be refuted 6) because of
the increase in chi-squared that the alleged void would entail in SN
measurements in the Hubble flow, and 7) because it would represent a 6 sigma
fluctuation of cosmic variance between the local and globally measured
expansion, requiring us to live in an exceedingly special location.

powerful tools for reducing the complexity of trajectories generated from
molecular dynamics simulations. These models require configuration-space
representations that accurately characterize the relevant dynamics.
Well-established, low-dimensional order parameters for constructing this
representation have led to widespread application of Markov state models to
study conformational dynamics in biomolecular systems. On the contrary,
applications to characterize single-molecule diffusion processes have been
scarce and typically employ system-specific, higher-dimensional order
parameters to characterize the local solvation state of the molecule. In this
work, we propose an automated method for generating a coarse
configuration-space representation, using generic features of solvation
structure---the coordination numbers about each particle. To overcome the
inherent noisy behavior of these low-dimensional observables, we treat the
features as indicators of an underlying, latent Markov process. The resulting
hidden Markov models filter the trajectories of each feature into the most
likely latent solvation state at each time step. The filtered trajectories are
then used to construct a configuration-space discretization, which accurately
describes the diffusion kinetics. The method is validated on a standard model
for glassy liquids, where particle jumps between local cages determine the
diffusion properties of the system. Not only do the resulting models provide
quantitatively accurate characterizations of the diffusion constant, but they
also reveal a mechanistic description of diffusive jumps, quantifying the
heterogeneity of local diffusion.

achieved, and entanglement-spectrum crossings of the time-dependent states for
the topological classes (AIII, DIII, CII, BDI, and D) are discovered as a
consequence of the bulk-edge correspondence. We note that, their classification
scheme relies on the limit that the energy spectrum of the post-quench
Hamiltonian is flat, because any finite band dispersion leads to the break down
of time-reversal and chiral symmetries for the parent Hamiltonian (which are
used for the classification). We show that, because of the reduction of
symmetry by finite energy dispersion, the gapless entanglement-spectrum
crossing in the flat-band limit in classes AIII, DIII, and CII is unstable, and
could be gapped without closing the bulk gap. The entanglement-spectrum
crossing in classes BDI and D is still stable against energy dispersion. We
show that the quench process for classes BDI and D can be understood as a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ fermion parity pump, and the entanglement-spectrum crossing for
this case is protected by the conservation of fermion parity.

shows directly the multi-photon pair production channels and provides a
sensitive test on the widely-used concept of the effective mass.
Nonperturbative features are identified in the dependence of the total yield on
the field intensity. In particular, various breaks in the momentum rings are
observed and proved to be a manifestation of particle's energy gaps in the
standing light wave induced by the Kapitza-Dirac scattering. A theoretical
model of multi-level systems coupled by the Kapitza-Dirac scattering and pair
production channels is established. Multi-channel interference effects and pair
production suppression are revealed in these systems.

models where regularization paths, as a family of estimators upon the
regularization parameter varying, are computed when the regularization

methods rely on solving a set of optimization problems where the regularization
parameters are fixed on a grid that might be inefficient. In this paper, we
introduce a simple iterative regularization path, which follows the dynamics of
a sparse Mirror Descent algorithm or a generalization of Linearized Bregman
Iterations with nonlinear loss. Its performance is competitive to
\texttt{glmnet} with a further bias reduction. A path consistency theory is
presented that under the Restricted Strong Convexity (RSC) and the
Irrepresentable Condition (IRR), the path will first evolve in a subspace with
no false positives and reach an estimator that is sign-consistent or of minimax
optimal $\ell_2$ error rate. Early stopping regularization is required to
prevent overfitting. Application examples are given in sparse logistic
regression and Ising models for NIPS coauthorship.

to warp image features forward from select keyframes, as a means to conserve
computation on video. This approach, however, achieves only limited speedup,
even when optimized, due to the accuracy degradation introduced by repeated
forward warping, and the inference cost of optical flow estimation. To address
these problems, we propose a new scheme that propagates features using the
block motion vectors (BMV) present in compressed video (e.g. H.264 codecs),
instead of optical flow, and bi-directionally warps and fuses features from
enclosing keyframes to capture scene context on each video frame. Our
technique, interpolation-BMV, enables us to accurately estimate the features of
intermediate frames, while keeping inference costs low. We evaluate our system
on the CamVid and Cityscapes datasets, comparing to both a strong single-frame

segmentation on video, achieving near real-time frame rates (20+ frames per

end, it is necessary to integrate omics data with other data types such as
clinical, phenotypic, and demographic parameters of categorical or continuous
nature. Here, we exemplify this data integration issue for a study on chronic
kidney disease (CKD), where complex clinical and demographic parameters were
assessed together with one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR metabolic fingerprints.
Routine analysis screens for associations of single metabolic features with
clinical parameters, which requires confounding variables typically chosen by
expert knowledge to be taken into account. This knowledge can be incomplete or
unavailable. The results of this article are manifold. We introduce a framework
for data integration that intrinsically adjusts for confounding variables. We
give its mathematical and algorithmic foundation, provide a state-of-the-art
implementation, and give several sanity checks. In particular, we show that the
discovered associations remain significant after variable adjustment based on
expert knowledge. In contrast, we illustrate that the discovery of associations
in routine analysis can be biased by incorrect or incomplete expert knowledge
in univariate screening approaches. Finally, we exemplify how our data
integration approach reveals important associations between CKD comorbidities
and metabolites. Moreover, we evaluate the predictive performance of the
estimated models on independent validation data and contrast the results with a
naive screening approach.

convergence to ergodic $\delta$-distributions. We relate $T_E$ to the
statistics of fluctuation times of the charges, which are dominated by fat
tails. $T_E$ is growing anomalously fast upon approaching the integrable limit,
as compared to the Lyapunov time $T_{\Lambda}$ - the inverse of the largest
Lyapunov exponent - reaching astonishing ratios $T_E/T_{\Lambda} \geq 10^8$.
The microscopic reason for the observed dynamical glass is routed in a growing
number of grains evolving over long times in a regular almost integrable
