is no rare phenomenon. Unfortunately, the complexities of dealing with even one
of these sources of variability individually means that the other signal is
often treated as a nuisance and discarded. However, both types of variability
offer means to probe fundamental stellar properties in robust ways through
asteroseismic and binary modelling. We present an efficient methodology that
includes both binary and asteroseismic information to estimate fundamental
stellar properties based on a grid-based modelling approach. We report
parameters for three gravity mode pulsating {\it Kepler} binaries , such as
mass, radius, age, as well the mass of the convective core and location of the
overshoot region. We discuss the presence of parameter degeneracies and the way
our methodology deals with them. We provide asteroseismically calibrated
isochrone-clouds to the community; these are a generalisation of isochrones
when allowing for different values of the core overshooting in the two

interaction. Robots need to accurately predict human's future movement in order
to safely plan its own motion trajectories and efficiently collaborate with
humans. Many recent approaches predict human's movement using deep learning
methods, such as recurrent neural networks. However, existing methods lack the
ability to adapt to time-varying human behaviors, and many of them do not
quantify uncertainties in the prediction. This paper proposes an approach that
uses a semi-adaptable neural network for human motion prediction, and provides
uncertainty bounds of the predictions in real time. In particular, a neural
network is trained offline to represent the human motion transition model, and
then recursive least square parameter adaptation algorithm (RLS-PAA) is adopted
for online parameter adaptation of the neural network and for uncertainty
estimation. Experiments on several human motion datasets verify that the
proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach in
terms of prediction accuracy and computation efficiency.

involves several inner-related multiscale processes that ultimately contribute
to its spread into the surrounding tissue. In order to gain a deeper
understanding of the tumour invasion process, we pay special attention to the
interacting dynamics between the cancer cell population and various
constituents of the surrounding tumour microenvironment. To that end, we
consider the key role that ECM plays within the human body tissue, providing
not only structure and support to surrounding cells, but also acting as a
platform for cells communication and spatial movement. There are several other
vital structures within the ECM, however we are going to focus primarily on
fibrous proteins, such as fibronectin. These fibres play a crucial role in
tumour progression, enabling the anchorage of tumour cells to the ECM. In this
work we consider the two-scale dynamic cross-talk between cancer cells and a
two component ECM (consisting of both a fibre and a non-fibre phase). To that
end, we incorporate the interlinked two-scale dynamics of cells-ECM
interactions within the tumour support that contributes simultaneously both to
cell-adhesion and to the dynamic rearrangement and restructuring of the ECM
fibres. Furthermore, this is embedded within a multiscale moving boundary
approach for the invading cancer cell population, in the presence of
cell-adhesion at the tissue scale and cell-scale fibre redistribution activity
and leading edge matrix degrading enzyme molecular proteolytic processes. The
overall modelling framework will be accompanied by computational results that
will explore the impact on cancer invasion patterns of different levels of cell
adhesion in conjunction with the continuous ECM fibres rearrangement.

that this model can also implement critical Higgs inflation, which corresponds
to the frontier between stability and metastability of the electroweak vacuum.
This leads to a value of the non-minimal coupling between the Higgs and the
Ricci scalar that is much lower than the one usually quoted in Higgs inflation
away from criticality. Then, an advantage is that the scale of perturbative
unitarity breaking on flat spacetime can be very close to the Planck mass,
where anyhow new physics is required. The higher dimensional operators are
under control in this inflationary setup. The dependence of the cutoff on the
Higgs background is also taken into account as appropriate when the Higgs is
identified with the inflaton. Furthermore, critical Higgs inflation enjoys a
robust inflationary attractor that makes it an appealing setup for the early
universe. In the proposed model, unlike in the Standard Model, critical Higgs
inflation can be realized without any tension with the observed quantities,
such as the top mass and the strong coupling.

rich interplay between algebraic and geometric ideas in \emph{geometric
invariant theory}. The concept of \emph{observable subgroup} was introduced in
the early 1960s with the purpose of studying extensions of representations from
an affine algebraic subgroup to the whole group. The extent of its importance
in \emph{representation and invariant theory} in particular for Hilbert's
$14^{\text{th}}$ problem was noticed almost immediately. An important
strenghtening appeared in the mid 1970s when the concept of \emph{strong
observability} was introduced and it was shown that the notion of observability
can be understood as an intermediate step in the notion of reductivity (or
semisimplicity), when adequately generalized. More recently starting in 2010,
the concept of observable subgroup was expanded to include the concept of
\emph{observable action} of an affine algebraic group on an affine variety,
launching a series of new applications. In 2006 the related concept of
\emph{observable adjunction} was introduced, and its application to module
categories over tensor categories was noticed. In the current survey, we follow
(approximately) the historical development of the subject introducing along the
way, the definitions and some of the main results including some of the proofs.

energy storage. They are produced by integrating thin sandwich structures of
CNT fiber veils and an ionic liquid-based polymer electrolyte between carbon
fiber plies, followed by infusion and curing of an epoxy resin. The resulting
structure behaves simultaneously as an electric double-layer capacitor and a
structural composite, with flexural modulus of 60 GPa and flexural strength of
153 MPa, combined with 88 mF/g of specific capacitance and the highest power
(30 W/kg) and energy (37.5 mWh/kg) densities reported so far for structural
supercapacitors. In-situ electrochemical measurements during 4-point bending
show that electrochemical performance is retained up to fracture, with minor
changes in equivalent series resistance for interleaves under compressive
stress. En route to improving interlaminar properties we produce grid-shaped
interleaves that enable mechanical interconnection of plies by the stiff epoxy.
Synchrotron 3D X-ray tomography analysis of the resulting hierarchical
structure confirms the formation of interlaminar epoxy joints. The manuscript
discusses encapsulation role of epoxy, demonstrated by charge-discharge
measurements of composites immersed in water, a deleterious agent for ionic
liquids. Finally, we show different architectures free of current collector and
electrical insulators, in which both CNT fiber and CF act as active electrodes.

  The aim of the project (which resulted in this arXiv version and the later
TPAMI paper) is the exploration of the current efficiency and large-scale
limits in fitting a parametric model for clustering to data distributions. To
reduce computational complexity, we used a clustering objective based on
truncated variational EM (which reduces complexity for many clusters) in
combination with coreset objectives (which reduce complexity for many data
points). We used efficient coreset construction and efficient seeding to
translate the theoretical sublinear complexity gains into an efficient
algorithm. In applications to standard large-scale benchmarks for clustering,
we then observed substantial wall-clock speedups compared to already highly
efficient clustering approaches. To demonstrate that the observed efficiency
enables applications previously considered unfeasible, we clustered the entire
and unscaled 80 Million Tiny Images dataset into up to 32,000 clusters.

influence each other to produce efficient plans and how such a model can
automatically learn to take advantage of observations of the environment.
Sampling-based planners such as RRT generally know nothing of their
environments even if they have traversed similar spaces many times. A sequence
model, such as an HMM or LSTM, guides the search for good paths. The resulting
model, called DeRRT*, observes the state of the planner and the local
environment to bias the next move and next planner state. The
neural-network-based models avoid manual feature engineering by co-training a
convolutional network which processes map features and observations from
sensors. We incorporate this sequence model in a manner that combines its
likelihood with the existing bias for searching large unexplored Voronoi
regions. This leads to more efficient trajectories with fewer rejected samples
even in difficult domains such as when escaping bug traps. This model can also
be used for dimensionality reduction in multi-agent environments with dynamic
obstacles. Instead of planning in a high-dimensional space that includes the
configurations of the other agents, we plan in a low-dimensional subspace
relying on the sequence model to bias samples using the observed behavior of
the other agents. The techniques presented here are general, include both
graphical models and deep learning approaches, and can be adapted to a range of
planners.

Previous work shows that the collection of maximal subalgebras of $B$ carries
the structure of a projective variety, denoted by $\operatorname{msa} (Q)$,
which only depends on the underlying quiver $Q$ of $B$. The automorphism group
$\operatorname{Aut}_k(B)$ acts regularly on $\operatorname{msa} (Q)$. Since
$\operatorname{msa} (Q)$ does not depend on the admissible ideal $I$, it is not
necessarily easy to tell when two points of $\operatorname{msa} (Q)$ actually

the double chain can be mapped onto the theory of a single chain. We consider
two sources of relaxation: the scattering from quantum phase slips (QPS) and
the interaction among plasmons related to the nonlinearity of the Josephson

phase-slip contribution behaves as a power law with a non-universal exponent.
In the parameter regime where the charging energy related to the junction
capacitance is much smaller than the Josephson energy, the amplitude of QPS is
strongly suppressed. This makes the relaxation mechanism related to QPS
efficient only at very low frequencies. As a result, for chains that are in the
infrared limit on the insulating side of the superconductor-insulator

using a generating function technique. For two particles, the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues are explicitly expressed using two parameters reminiscent of Bethe
roots, whose numerical values are determined by polynomial equations which we
derive. The spectrum depends in a complicated way on the ratio of direction
reversal rate to lattice jump rate, $\omega$. For both one and two particles,
the spectrum consists of separate real bands for large $\omega$, which mix and
become complex-valued for small $\omega$. At exceptional values of $\omega$,
two or more eigenvalues coalesce such that the Markov matrix is
non-diagonalizable. A consequence of this intricate parameter dependence is the
appearance of dynamical transitions: non-analytic minima in the longest
relaxation times as functions of $\omega$ (for a given lattice size).
Exceptional points are theoretically and experimentally relevant in, e.g., open
quantum systems and multichannel scattering. We propose that the phenomenon
should be a ubiquitous feature of classical nonequilibrium models as well, and
of relevance to physical observables in this context.

waves occurring under anesthesia present no positive effects on memory. Here,
we shed light onto this paradox, based on a combination of extracellular
recordings in vivo, in vitro, and computational models. We find two types of
slow waves, based on analyzing the temporal patterns of successive slow-wave
events. The first type is consistently observed in natural slow-wave sleep,
while the second is shown to be ubiquitous under anesthesia. Network models of
spiking neurons predict that the two slow wave types emerge due to a different
gain on inhibitory vs excitatory cells and that different levels of
spike-frequency adaptation in excitatory cells can account for dynamical
distinctions between the two types. This prediction was tested in vitro by
varying adaptation strength using an agonist of acetylcholine receptors, which
demonstrated a neuromodulatory switch between the two types of slow waves.
Finally, we show that the first type of slow-wave dynamics is more sensitive to
external stimuli, which can explain how slow waves in sleep and anesthesia
differentially affect memory consolidation, as well as provide a link between
slow-wave dynamics and memory diseases.

computed from the light-cone QCD sum rules (LCSR) at tree level. In particular,
we construct the local duality model for the twist-five and -six $B$-meson
LCDAs, in agreement with the corresponding asymptotic behaviours at small quark
and gluon momenta, employing the QCD sum rules in heavy quark effective theory
at leading order in $\alpha_s$. The strange quark mass effects in semileptonic
$B \to K$ form factors yield the leading-power contribution in the heavy quark
expansion, consistent with the power-counting analysis in soft-collinear
effective theory, and they are also computed from the LCSR approach due to the
appearance of the rapidity singularities. We further explore the
phenomenological aspects of the semileptonic $B \to \pi \ell \nu$ decays and
the rare exclusive processes $B \to K \nu \nu$, including the determination of
the CKM matrix element $|V_{ub}|$, the normalized differential $q^2$

applications, but the training of adversarial models can be notoriously
unstable. Effectively balancing the performance of the generator and
discriminator is critical, since a discriminator that achieves very high
accuracy will produce relatively uninformative gradients. In this work, we
propose a simple and general technique to constrain information flow in the
discriminator by means of an information bottleneck. By enforcing a constraint
on the mutual information between the observations and the discriminator's
internal representation, we can effectively modulate the discriminator's
accuracy and maintain useful and informative gradients. We demonstrate that our
proposed variational discriminator bottleneck (VDB) leads to significant
improvements across three distinct application areas for adversarial learning
algorithms. Our primary evaluation studies the applicability of the VDB to
imitation learning of dynamic continuous control skills, such as running. We
show that our method can learn such skills directly from \emph{raw} video
demonstrations, substantially outperforming prior adversarial imitation
learning methods. The VDB can also be combined with adversarial inverse
reinforcement learning to learn parsimonious reward functions that can be
transferred and re-optimized in new settings. Finally, we demonstrate that VDB
can train GANs more effectively for image generation, improving upon a number
of prior stabilization methods.

the population likelihood is locally strongly concave around its maximizing
argument. Examples include suitably separated Gaussian mixture models and
mixtures of linear regressions. We consider over-specified settings in which
the number of fitted components is larger than the number of components in the
true distribution. Such misspecified settings can lead to singularity in the
Fisher information matrix, and moreover, the maximum likelihood estimator based
on $n$ i.i.d. samples in $d$ dimensions can have a non-standard
$\mathcal{O}((d/n)^{\frac{1}{4}})$ rate of convergence. Focusing on the simple
setting of two-component mixtures fit to a $d$-dimensional Gaussian
distribution, we study the behavior of the EM algorithm both when the mixture
weights are different (unbalanced case), and are equal (balanced case). Our
analysis reveals a sharp distinction between these two cases: in the former,
the EM algorithm converges geometrically to a point at Euclidean distance of
$\mathcal{O}((d/n)^{\frac{1}{2}})$ from the true parameter, whereas in the
latter case, the convergence rate is exponentially slower, and the fixed point
has a much lower $\mathcal{O}((d/n)^{\frac{1}{4}})$ accuracy. Analysis of this

particular, we make use of a careful form of localization in the associated
empirical process, and develop a recursive argument to progressively sharpen

equation for the contact angle in terms of the transporting velocity field. It
turns out that the resulting equation has a simple structure and expresses the
time derivative of the contact angle in terms of the velocity gradient at the
solid wall. Together with the additionally imposed boundary conditions for the
velocity, it yields a more specific form of the contact angle evolution. Thus,
the kinematic evolution equation is a tool to analyze the evolution of the
contact angle. Since the transporting velocity field is required only on the
moving interface, the kinematic evolution equation also applies when the
interface moves with its own velocity independent of the fluid velocity. We
apply the developed tool to a class of moving contact line models which employ
the Navier slip boundary condition. We derive an explicit form of the contact
angle evolution for sufficiently regular solutions, showing that such solutions
are unphysical. Within the simplest model, this rigorously shows that the
contact angle can only relax to equilibrium if some kind of singularity is
present at the contact line. Moreover, we analyze more general models including
surface tension gradients at the contact line, slip at the fluid-fluid
interface and mass transfer across the fluid-fluid interface.

novel neural network architecture is described that is capable of examining

infers the plasma temperature from observing jets, which is demonstrated using

the construction of a convenient orthogonal basis for the chiral ring, by
arranging towers of operators in order of increasing dimension, which has the
property that the associated two-point functions satisfy decoupled Toda chain
equations. We explicitly verify this in all known SCFTs based on

Absorption-line measurements along the sightlines to bright and rare background
quasars indicate that this circumgalactic medium pervades far beyond the extent
of starlight in galaxies, but very little is known about the spatial
distribution of this gas. A new window into circumgalactic environments was
recently opened with the discovery of ubiquitous extended Lyman-alpha emission
from hydrogen around high-redshift galaxies, facilitated by the extraordinary
sensitivity of the MUSE instrument at the ESO Very Large Telescope. Due to the
faintness of this emission, such measurements were previously limited to
especially favourable systems or to massive statistical averaging. Here we
demonstrate that low surface brightness Lyman-alpha emission surrounding faint
galaxies at redshifts between 3 and 6 adds up to a projected sky coverage of
nearly 100%. The corresponding rate of incidence (the mean number of
Lyman-alpha emitters penetrated by any arbitrary line of sight) is well above
unity and similar to the incidence rate of high column density absorbers
frequently detected in the spectra of distant quasars. This similarity suggests
that most circumgalactic atomic hydrogen at these redshifts has now been
detected also in emission.

  Building upon a novel observation that the straight-through gradient method

changing the geared limit can vary the hardness of finding the ground state

sensitivity ($K_s<19$ mag) of the ESO-VISTA near-infrared survey of the Orion A

among previously known protostars and pre-main-sequence stars with disks,
source contamination levels (false positives) are at least $\sim$6.4% and
$\sim$2.3%, respectively, mostly due to background galaxies and nebulosities.
We identify 274 new YSO candidates using VISTA/Spitzer based selections within
previously analyzed regions, and VISTA/WISE based selections to add sources in
the surroundings, beyond previously analyzed regions. The WISE selection method
recovers about 59% of the known YSOs in Orion A's low-mass star-forming part

on the de-reddened mid-infrared spectral index into 188 protostars, 185
flat-spectrum sources, and 2607 pre-main-sequence stars with circumstellar
disks. We find a statistically significant difference in the spatial

Hermitian Yang-Mill's equations and compatible B and H fields that satisfy the
anomaly cancellation conditions. Our perspective is to consider a geometry in
which these backgrounds are fibred over a parameter space. If the manifold X
has coordinates x, and parameters are denoted by y, then it is natural to
consider coordinate transformations x \to \tilde{x}(x,y) and y \to
\tilde{y}(y). Similarly, gauge transformations of the gauge field and B field
also depend on both x and y. In the process of defining deformations of the
background fields that are suitably covariant under these transformations, it
turns out to be natural to extend the gauge field A to a gauge field \IA on the
extended (x,y)-space. Similarly, the B, H, and other fields are also extended.
The total space of the fibration of the heterotic structures is the Universal
Geometry of the title. The extension of gauge fields has been studied in
relation to Donaldson theory and monopole moduli spaces. String vacua furnish a
richer application of these ideas. One advantage of this point of view is that
previously disparate results are unified into a simple tensor formulation. In a
previous paper, by three of the present authors, the metric on the moduli space
of heterotic theories was derived, correct through order \alpha', and it was
shown how this was related to a simple Kahler potential. With the present
formalism, we are able to rederive the results of this previously long and

lived particle produce $B$ mesons and anti-mesons out of thermal equilibrium.
These mesons/anti-mesons then undergo CP violating oscillations before quickly
decaying into visible and dark sector particles. Dark matter will be charged
under Baryon number so that the visible sector baryon asymmetry is produced
without violating the total baryon number of the Universe. The produced baryon
asymmetry will be directly related to the leptonic charge asymmetry in neutral
$B$ decays; an experimental observable. Dark matter is stabilized by an
unbroken discrete symmetry, and proton decay is simply evaded by kinematics. We
will illustrate this mechanism with a model that is unconstrained by di-nucleon
decay, does not require a high reheat temperature, and would have unique
experimental signals -- a positive leptonic asymmetry in $B$ meson decays, a
new decay of $B$ mesons into a baryon and missing energy, and a new decay of

are testable at current and upcoming collider experiments, allowing for a

A1664 is highly disturbed, as the global metallicity and cooling time flatten
at small radii, implying mixing on large scales. The central AGN appears to
have recently undergone a mechanical outburst, as evidenced by our detection of
cavities. These cavities are the X-ray manifestations of radio bubbles inflated
by the AGN, and may explain the motion of cold molecular CO clouds previously
observed with ALMA. The estimated mechanical power of the AGN, using the
minimum energy required to inflate the cavities as a proxy, is $P_{\rm cav} =
(1.1 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{44} $ erg s$^{-1}$, which may be enough to drive the
molecular gas flows, and offset the cooling luminosity of the ICM, at $L_{\rm
cool} = (1.90 \pm0.01)\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This mechanical power is
orders of magnitude higher than the measured upper limit on the X-ray
luminosity of the central AGN, suggesting that its black hole may be extremely
massive and/or radiatively inefficient. We map temperature variations on the
same spatial scale as the molecular gas, and find that the most rapidly cooling

Despite this, recent observations have shown that these objects typically have
large reservoirs of cold molecular gas. In this paper we study the star-forming
gas properties of a large sample of post-starburst galaxies selected from the
cosmological, hydrodynamical EAGLE simulations. These objects resemble observed
high-mass post-starburst galaxies both spectroscopically and in terms of their
space density, stellar mass distribution and sizes. We find that the vast
majority of simulated post-starburst galaxies have significant gas reservoirs,
with star-forming gas masses of ~10$^9$ M$_{\odot}$, in good agreement with
those seen in observational samples. The simulation reproduces the observed
time evolution of the gas fraction of the post-starburst galaxy population,
with the average galaxy losing ~90 per cent of its star-forming interstellar
medium in only ~600 Myr. A variety of gas consumption/loss processes are
responsible for this rapid evolution, including mergers and environmental
effects, while active galactic nuclei play only a secondary role. The fast
evolution in the gas fraction of post-starburst galaxies is accompanied by a
clear decrease in the efficiency of star formation, due to a decrease in the
dense gas fraction. We predict that forthcoming ALMA observations of the gas
reservoirs of low-redshift post-starburst galaxies will show that the molecular
gas is typically compact and has disturbed kinematics, reflecting the
disruptive nature of many of the evolutionary pathways that build up the
post-starburst galaxy population.

to resolve in numerical simulations. When the disc and black hole angular
momentum vectors are misaligned, the challenge becomes extreme, requiring
adaptive meshes to follow the disc proper as it moves through the computational
grid. With our new high-performance general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
(GRMHD) code H-AMR we have simulated the thinnest accretion disc to date, of
aspect ratio H/R~0.03, around a rapidly spinning (a=0.9375) black hole, using a
cooling function. Initially tilted at 10 degrees, the disc warps inside r~5 r_g
into alignment with the black hole, where r_g is the gravitational radius. This
is the first demonstration of Bardeen-Petterson alignment in MHD with viscosity
self-consistently generated by magnetized turbulence. The disc develops a
low-density high-viscosity (alpha_eff ~ 1.0) magnetic-pressure--dominated inner
region at r<25 r_g that rapidly empties itself into the black hole. This inner
region may in reality, due to thermal decoupling of ions and electrons,
evaporate into a radiatively inefficient accretion flow if, as we propose, the
cooling time exceeds the accretion time set by the order unity effective
viscosity. We furthermore find the unexpected result that even our very thin
disc can sustain large-scale vertical magnetic flux on the black hole, which
launches powerful relativistic jets that carry 20-50% of the accretion power
along the angular momentum vector of the outer tilted disc, providing a
potential explanation for the origin of jets in radio-loud quasars.

contrast with the previous ambient pressure measurements of Cao et al. where
the quarter--filling state (QFS) is a metal [Nature 556, 43 & 80 (2018)]. In
fact, the insulating state at the other commensurate fillings of two and three

realistic computations of the band structure for TBLG which show that the
bandwidth first shrinks and then expands with increasing hydrostatic pressure,
we compute the ratio of the potential to the kinetic energy, $r_s$. We find an
experimentally relevant window of pressure for which $r_s$ crosses the
threshold for a triangular Wigner crystal, thereby corroborating our previous
work [Nano Lett. (2018)] that the insulating states in TBLG are due to Wigner
rather than Mott physics. A key prediction of this work is that the window for
the onset of the hierarchy of Wigner states that obtains at commensurate
fillings is dome-shaped as a function of the applied pressure, which can be
probed experimentally. Theoretically, we find a peak for crystallization around
$1.5$ GPa relative to the experimental optimal pressure of $1.33$ GPa for the
observation of the insulating states. Consequently, TBLG provides a new
platform for the exploration of Wigner physics and its relationship with

simultaneously fit a UVB emissivity and clustering bias factor to these

the Lyman break, (ii) the non-ionizing UV continuum, which agrees with the
Haardt & Madau model but does not rely on any assumption regarding the nature

single-mode squeezed states are sent through linear-optical interferometers and

samples for different numbers of modes and detector clicks. It is possible to
simulate a system with 800 optical modes postselected on outputs with 20
detector clicks, producing a single sample in roughly two hours using $40\%$ of
the available nodes of Titan. Additionally, we benchmark the performance of GBS
when applied to dense subgraph identification, even in the presence of photon

binary-binary black hole interactions with the inclusion of general relativity.
When including general relativistic effects in strong encounters, dissipation
of orbital energy from gravitational waves (GWs) can lead to captures and
subsequent inspirals with appreciable eccentricities when entering the
sensitive frequency ranges of the LIGO and Virgo GW detectors. In this study,
we perform binary-binary and binary-single scattering experiments with general
relativistic dynamics up through the 2.5 post-Newtonian order included, both in
a controlled setting to gauge the importance of non-dissipative post-Newtonian
terms and derive scaling relations for the cross-section of GW captures, as
well as experiments tuned to the strong interactions from state-of-the art
globular cluster models to assess the relative importance of the binary-binary
channel at facilitating GW captures and the resultant eccentricity
distributions of inspiral from channel. Although binary-binary interactions are
10-100 times less frequent in globular clusters than binary-single
interactions, their longer lifetime and more complex dynamics leads to a higher
probability for GW captures to occur during the encounter. We find that
binary-binary interactions contribute 25-45% of the eccentric mergers which
occur during strong black hole encounters in globular clusters, regardless of
the properties of the cluster environment. The inclusion of higher multiplicity
encounters in dense star clusters therefore have major implications on the
predicted rates of highly eccentric binaries potentially detectable by the
LIGO/Virgo network. As gravitational waveforms of eccentric inspirals are
distinct from those generated by merging binaries which have circularized,
measurements of eccentricity in such systems would highly constrain their
formation scenario.

disks with a radially decreasing temperature gradient and a colder midplane. We
are motivated by recent reports of resolved dark lanes (`hamburgers') and
(sub)mm spectral indices systematically below the ISM value for optically thin
dust $\alpha_{\rm ISM} =3.7$. We explore several model grids, scaling disk mass
and varying inclination angle $i$ and observing frequency $\nu$ from the VLA Ka
band ($\sim 37$ GHz) to ALMA Band 8 ($\sim 405$ GHz). We also consider the
effects of decreasing the index of the (sub-)mm dust opacity power law $\beta$
from 1.7 to 1. We find that a distribution of disk masses in the range $M_{\rm
disk} = 0.01-2~M_\odot$ is needed to reproduce the observed distribution of
spectral indices, and that assuming a fixed $\beta =1.7$ gives better results
than $\beta=1$. A wide distribution of disk masses is also needed to produce
some cases with $\alpha <2$, as reported for some sources in the literature.
Such extremely low spectral indices arise naturally when the selected observing
frequencies sample the appropriate change in the temperature structure of the
optically thick model disk. Our results show that protostellar disk masses
could often be underestimated by $> \times10$, and are consistent with recent
hydrodynamical simulations. Although we do not rule out the possibility of some
grain growth occurring within the short protostellar timescales, we conclude
that self-obscuration needs to be taken into account.

spin-liquid behavior. We use the variational principle and the Chern-Simons

result proves that the ground state of the system cannot stabilize a Bose

exhibiting a moat-like dispersion (which is degenerate along a closed contour
in the reciprocal space). We also suggest experimental probes to differentiate

We find that cross-correlation between optical and radio can significantly
improve the measurement of growth rate. Combining these with the CMB provides a
promising avenue to detecting modified gravity at high redshifts, in particular
by independently probing the Weyl and Newtonian potentials and by strengthening
control of systematics. We find that cross-correlating a Stage {\sc ii} 21-cm

enable measurements of the growth rate $f\sigma_8$ at sub 3\% and sub 8\%

In order to do this, the agent must (1) understand what it recognizes and what
it does not, (2) formulate a valid, unambiguous and informative language query
(a question) to ask the Oracle, (3) derive the parameters of visual classifiers
from the Oracle response and (4) leverage the updated visual classifiers to ask
more clarified questions. Specifically, we propose a novel framework and
formulate the learning of visual curiosity as a reinforcement learning problem.
In this framework, all components of our agent, visual recognition module (to
see), question generation policy (to ask), answer digestion module (to
understand) and graph memory module (to memorize), are learned entirely
end-to-end to maximize the reward derived from the scene graph obtained by the
agent as a consequence of the dialog with the Oracle. Importantly, the question
generation policy is disentangled from the visual recognition system and
specifics of the environment. Consequently, we demonstrate a sort of double

significantly faster than several heuristic baselines, even when tested on

long-range screening and colloidal stabilization which are not predicted by the
classic Debye-Huckel theory. We show that a Coulomb or charge-frustrated Ising
model, which accounts for both long-range Coulomb and short-range molecular
interactions, simply describes some of these ionic correlations. In particular,
we obtain at mean field level and in simulations, a non-monotonic dependence of
the screening length on the temperature. Using a combination of simulations and
mean field theories, we study how the correlations in the various regimes are
affected by the strength of the short ranged interactions.

wireless networks over small-scale $\alpha$-$\mu$ fading channels, where both
the legitimate receivers and eavesdroppers are distributed with two independent
homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPPs). Specifically, accounting for the
presence of non-colluding eavesdroppers, secrecy performance metrics, including
the connection outage probability (COP), the probability of non-zero secrecy
capacity (PNZ) and ergodic secrecy capacity, are derived regarding the $k$-th
nearest/best user cases. The index for the $k$-th nearest user is extracted
from the ordering, in terms of the distances between transmitters and
receivers, whereas that for the $k$-th best user is based on the combined
effects of path-loss and small-scale fading. In particular, the probability
density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the
composite channel gain, for the $k$-th nearest and best user, are
characterized, respectively. Benefiting from these results, closed-form
representations of the COP, PNZ and ergodic secrecy capacity are subsequently
obtained. Furthermore, a limit on the maximal number of the best-ordered users
is also computed, for a given secrecy outage constraint. Finally, numerical
results are provided to verify the correctness of our derivations.
Additionally, the effects of fading parameters, path-loss exponent, and density

partial differential equations using numerical methods. It enables time-varying
regions of much higher resolution, which can be used to track discontinuities
in the solution by selectively refining around those areas. The open source
Clawpack software implements block-structured AMR to refine around propagating
waves in the AMRClaw package. For problems where the solution must be computed
over a large domain but is only of interest in a small area this approach often
refines waves that will not impact the target area. We seek a method that
enables the identification and refinement of only the waves that will influence
the target area.
  Here we show that solving the time-dependent adjoint equation and using a
suitable inner product allows for a more precise refinement of the relevant
waves. We present the adjoint methodology in general, and give details on how
this method has been implemented in AMRClaw. Examples for linear acoustics
equations are presented, and a computational performance analysis is conducted.
The adjoint method is compared to AMR methods already available in the AMRClaw
software, and the resulting advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The

applied to the surface of the sample, and the particle velocity history is
measured at two or more different distances into the sample, at interfaces
where the surface of the sample can be probed. The velocity histories are used
to deduce a stress-density relation, usually using iterative Lagrangian
analysis to account for the perturbing effect of the impedance mismatch at the
interface. In that technique, a stress- density relation is assumed in order to
correct for the perturbation, and is adjusted until it becomes consistent with
the deduced stress-density relation. This process is subject to the usual
difficulties of nonlinear optimization, such as the existence of local minima
(sensitivity to the initial guess), possible failure to converge, and
relatively large computational effort. We show that, by considering the
interaction of successive characteristics reaching the interfaces, the
stress-density relation can be deduced directly by recursion rather than
iteration. This calculation is orders of magnitude faster than iterative
analysis, and does not require an initial guess. Direct recursion may be less

rate has previously been used as a proxy for cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning

denoted CP, to represent the climatology and variability of CG lightning flash
counts over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) during the period 2003--2016 is
assessed. CP values computed using the North American Regional Reanalysis are
compared with negative and positive polarity CG flash counts from the National
Lightning Detection Network. Overall, the proxy performs better on shorter time
scales (daily and monthly) than on longer time scales (annual and semi-annual).
Proxy performance tends to be worse during the warm season (May--October), when
most lightning occurs, and better during the cool season (November--April). The
correlation of annually accumulated CONUS CP with CG flash counts is not
statistically significant because of poor warm-season performance. Cool season
negative CG flash counts are well-correlated with CONUS CP values. Positive CG
flash counts ($\sim$7% of all CG flashes) are well correlated with annual
values of CONUS CP. The relatively strong relations between CP and CG flash
counts in some regions and times of the year at daily resolution provide a
benchmark for more complex proxies and suggest that proxy-based extended- and
long-range prediction of lightning activity may be feasible to the extent that
precipitation rate and CAPE can be predicted.

number of species competing for a smaller number of resources cannot coexist.
However, it has been observed empirically that in some settings it is possible
to have coexistence. One example is Hutchinson's `paradox of the plankton'.
This is an instance where a large number of phytoplankton species coexist while
competing for a very limited number of resources. Both experimental and
theoretical studies have shown that temporal fluctuations of the environment
can facilitate coexistence for competing species. Hutchinson conjectured that
one can get coexistence because nonequilibrium conditions would make it
possible for different species to be favored by the environment at different
times.
  In this paper we show in various settings how a variable (stochastic)
environment enables a set of competing species limited by a smaller number of
resources or other density dependent factors to coexist. If the environmental
fluctuations are modeled by white noise, and the per-capita growth rates of the
competitors depend linearly on the resources, we prove that there is
competitive exclusion. However, if either the dependence between the growth
rates and the resources is not linear or the white noise term is nonlinear we
show that coexistence on fewer resources than species is possible. Even more
surprisingly, if the temporal environmental variation comes from switching the
environment at random times between a finite number of possible states, it is
possible for all species to coexist even if the growth rates depend linearly on
the resources. We show in an example (a variant of which first appeared in
Benaim and Lobry '16) that, contrary to Hutchinson's explanation, one can
switch between two environments in which the same species is favored and still
get coexistence.

cryptography in recent years. Although this technique is characterized by a
very high level of security, there are still challenges that limit the
widespread use of quantum key distribution. One of the most important problem
remains secure and effective mechanisms for the key distillation process. This
article presents a new idea for a key reconciliation method in quantum
cryptography. This proposal assumes the use of mutual synchronization of
artificial neural networks to correct errors occurring during transmission in
the quantum channel. Users can build neural networks based on their own string
of bits. The typical value of the quantum bit error rate does not exceed a few
percent, therefore the strings are similar and also users' neural networks are
very similar at the beginning of the learning process. It has been shown that
the synchronization process in the new solution is much faster than in the
analogous scenario used in neural cryptography. This feature significantly
increases the level of security because a potential eavesdropper cannot
effectively synchronize their own artificial neural networks in order to obtain
information about the key. Therefore, the key reconciliation based on the new
idea can be a secure and efficient solution.

community; to the best of our knowledge, however, there is no planner that can
adapt to different interaction contexts spontaneously after autonomously

energy properties and test modifications of Einstein's gravity. We study the
21cm bispectrum due to gravitational collapse as well as the contribution by
line of sight perturbations in the form of the lensing-ISW bispectrum at
low-redshifts ($z \sim 0.35-3$), targeted by upcoming neutral hydrogen
intensity mapping experiments. We compute the expected bispectrum amplitudes
and use a Fisher forecast model to compare power spectrum and bispectrum
observations of intensity mapping surveys by CHIME, MeerKAT and SKA-mid. We
find that combined power spectrum and bispectrum observations have the
potential to decrease errors on the cosmological parameters by an order of
magnitude compared to Planck. Finally, we compute the contribution of the
lensing-ISW bispectrum, and find that, unlike for the cosmic microwave
background analyses, it can safely be ignored for 21cm bispectrum observations.

specifically, we develop a sampling framework that sits as a layer on top of

yields of the most metal-poor stars (appr. Z<=10^-5) is critical because they
are part of the big picture of the history of the primitive Universe. Yet many
of the remaining unknowns of stellar evolution lie in the birth, life, and
death of these objects. We review stellar evolution of intermediate-mass (IMS)
Z<=10-5 models existing in the literature, with a focus on the problem of their
final fates. The depth and efficiency of mixing episodes are critical to
determine the mass limits for the formation of electron-capture supernovae, but
our knowledge of these phenomena is not complete because they are strongly
affected by the choice of input physics. We also consider the alternative
SNI1/2 channel to form SNe out of the most metal-poor IMS. In this case, it is
critical to understand the thermally-pulsing AGB evolution until the late
stages. Efficient second dredge-up and, later, third dredge-up episodes could
be able to pollute stellar envelopes enough for the stars to undergo thermal
pulses in a way very similar to that of higher initial Z objects. Inefficient
2nd and/or 3rd dredge-up may leave an almost pristine envelope, unable to
sustain strong stellar winds. This may allow the H-exhausted core to grow to
M_Ch before the envelope is lost, and thus let the star explode as a SNI1/2.
After reviewing the information available on these two possible channels for
the formation of SNe, we discuss existing nucleosynthetic yields of stars of
metallicity Z<=10^-5, and present an example of nucleosynthetic calculations
for a thermally-pulsing Super-AGB star of Z=10^-5. We compare theoretical
predictions with observations of the lowest [Fe/H] objects detected. The review
closes by discussing current open questions as well as possible fruitful
avenues for future research.

regarded an effective way of load balancing in parallel computing systems. When
combined with nodes pulling in work upon becoming idle, HomT has the desirable
property of automatically adapting its load distribution to the processing
capacities of participating nodes - more powerful nodes finish their work
sooner and, therefore, pull in additional work faster. As a result, HomT is
deemed especially desirable in settings with heterogeneous (and possibly
possessing dynamically changing) processing capacities. However, HomT does have
additional scheduling and I/O overheads that might make this load balancing
scheme costly in some scenarios. In this paper, we first analyze these
advantages and disadvantages of HomT. We then propose an alternative load
balancing scheme - Heterogeneous MacroTasking (HeMT) - wherein workload is
intentionally partitioned according to nodes' processing capacity. Our goal is
to study when HeMT is able to overcome the performance disadvantages of HomT.
We implement a prototype of HeMT within the Apache Spark application framework
with complementary enhancements to the Apache Mesos cluster manager. Spark's
built-in scheduler, when parameterized appropriately, implements HomT. Our
experimental results show that HeMT out-performs HomT when accurate
workload-specific estimates of nodes' processing capacities are learned. As
representative results, Spark with HeMT offers about 10% better average
completion times for realistic data processing workloads over the default
system.

"1810.00994","Alvin Gonzales","Alvin Gonzales, Eric Chitambar","Bounds on Instantaneous Nonlocal Quantum Computation","Comments welcome!",,"10.1109/TIT.2019.2950190",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation refers to a process in which
spacelike separated parties simulate a nonlocal quantum operation on their
joint systems through the consumption of pre-shared entanglement. To prevent a
violation of causality, this simulation succeeds up to local errors that can
only be corrected after the parties communicate classically with one another.
However, this communication is non-interactive, and it involves just the
broadcasting of local measurement outcomes. We refer to this operational
paradigm as local operations and broadcast communication (LOBC) to distinguish
it from the standard local operations and (interactive) classical communication
(LOCC). In this paper, we show that an arbitrary two-qubit gate can be
implemented by LOBC with $\epsilon$-error using $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ entangled
bits (ebits). This offers an exponential improvement over the best known
two-qubit protocols, whose ebit costs behave as $O(1/\epsilon)$. We also
consider the family of binary controlled gates on dimensions $d_A\otimes d_B$.
We find that any hermitian gate of this form can be implemented by LOBC using a
single shared ebit. In sharp contrast, a lower bound of $\log d_B$ ebits is
shown in the case of generic (i.e. non-hermitian) gates from this family, even
when $d_A=2$. This demonstrates an unbounded gap between the entanglement costs
of LOCC and LOBC gate implementation. Whereas previous lower bounds on the
entanglement cost for instantaneous nonlocal computation restrict the minimum
dimension of the needed entanglement, we bound its entanglement entropy. To our
knowledge this is the first such lower bound of its kind.

Heavy quarks offer unique insights towards detailed understanding of the sQGP

  In this talk, I will review recent results from heavy quark production

  minimal local smoothness assumption",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of optimizing a function under a \emph{budgeted number
of evaluations}. We only assume that the function is \emph{locally} smooth
around one of its global optima. The difficulty of optimization is measured in
terms of 1) the amount of \emph{noise} $b$ of the function evaluation and 2)
the local smoothness, $d$, of the function. A smaller $d$ results in smaller
optimization error. We come with a new, simple, and parameter-free approach.
First, for all values of $b$ and $d$, this approach recovers at least the
state-of-the-art regret guarantees. Second, our approach additionally obtains
these results while being \textit{agnostic} to the values of both $b$ and $d$.
This leads to the first algorithm that naturally adapts to an \textit{unknown}
range of noise $b$ and leads to significant improvements in a moderate and
low-noise regime. Third, our approach also obtains a remarkable improvement
over the state-of-the-art SOO algorithm when the noise is very low which
includes the case of optimization under deterministic feedback ($b=0$). There,
under our minimal local smoothness assumption, this improvement is of
exponential magnitude and holds for a class of functions that covers the vast
majority of functions that practitioners optimize ($d=0$). We show that our
algorithmic improvement is borne out in experiments as we empirically show
faster convergence on common benchmarks.

ablation pressure of planar inertial confinement fusion (ICF) targets is
explored using an idealized model. Polar direct drive (PDD) on the National
Ignition Facility (NIF) requires the repointing of its 192 beams clustered
within 50 degrees of the poles to minimize the imparted polar varying payload
kinetic energy of the target. Due to this repointing, non-normal incidence
angles of the beam centerlines are encountered in any PDD design. The
formulation of a PDD scheme that minimizes non-uniformity is a significant
challenge that requires an understanding of the induced differences in ablation
including those of incidence angle. In this work, a modified version of the
textbook model of laser ablation [Manheimer et al. Phys. Fluids 25, 1644
(1982)] is used to demonstrate that the mass ablation rate and ablation
pressure scale with the 4/3 and 2/3 power of the cosine of the laser ray
incidence angle for the planar case during the beginning portion of the laser
ablation. This result is considered with an idealized 1-D two segment planar
model using rays at different incidence angles for each segment. Within the
model, the segments cannot have equal mass and velocity simultaneously without
tailoring the ray's time-dependent intensity for each segment. However, with
the correct segment-to-segment time-independent ray intensities, equal velocity
and dynamic pressure can be achieved approximately without tailoring.
Additionally, an analytic prediction for the conduction zone width as a
function of incidence angle is provided. It is predicted that this width
increases with incidence angle, resulting in a decrease in laser imprint, an
effect which has been previously observed in experiments. These results, when
generalized to spherical geometry, may provide insight into the implosion
dynamics encountered in PDD.

addition of an extra spatial dimension, with the ferromagnet living on its

absences. There are few, if any detailed accounts of the contingent, material
ways in which usability testing is actually practiced. Further, it is rare that
industry practitioners' testing work is treated as indigenous and particular
(instead subordinated as a `compromised' version). To service these problems,
this paper presents an ethnomethodological study of usability testing practices
in a design consultancy. It unpacks how findings are produced in and as the
work of observers analysing the test as it unfolds between moderators taking
participants through relevant tasks. The study nuances conventional views of
usability findings as straightforwardly `there to be found' or `read off' by
competent evaluators. It explores how evaluators / observers collaboratively
work to locate relevant troubles in the test's unfolding. However, in the
course of doing this work, potential candidate troubles may also routinely be
dissipated and effectively `ignored' in one way or another. The implications of
the study suggest refinements to current understandings of usability
evaluations, and affirm the value to HCI in studying industry practitioners
more deeply.

every vertex of $G$ according to the following rules: in the first timestep,
every vertex in $N[S]$ becomes colored; in each subsequent timestep, every
vertex which is the only non-colored neighbor of some colored vertex becomes

implementation of probabilistic mapping method. This paper improves the SVO
mapping by initializing the mean and the variance of the depth at a feature
location according to the depth prediction from a single-image depth prediction

point (i.e., small variance centred about the depth prediction), the benefits
are twofold: reliable feature correspondence between views and fast convergence
to the true depth in order to create new map points. We evaluate our method

Three-dimensional structures of the brain hemispheres and spinal cords of the

Microtomographic cross sections reconstructed from the X-ray images revealed
dilation of capillary vessels and vacuolation in the spinal cord of the EAE

neuroinflammatory response progressed in the brain. The vessel networks and
vacuolation lesions in the spinal cords were modelled by automatically tracing

quantitatively. The results of the analysis indicated that the distribution of
vacuolations was not uniform but three-dimensionally localized. The mean vessel

(SGD) computation is to distribute the randomly selected batch of inputs over
multiple processors. To keep the distributed processors fully utilized requires
commensurately growing the batch size. However, large batch training often
leads to poorer generalization. A recently proposed solution for this problem
is to use adaptive batch sizes in SGD. In this case, one starts with a small
number of processes and scales the processes as training progresses. Two major
challenges with this approach are (i) that dynamically resizing the cluster can
add non-trivial overhead, in part since it is currently not supported, and (ii)
that the overall speed up is limited by the initial phase with smaller batches.
In this work, we address both challenges by developing a new adaptive batch
size framework, with autoscaling based on the Ray framework. This allows very
efficient elastic scaling with negligible resizing overhead (0.32\% of time for
ResNet18 ImageNet training). Furthermore, we propose a new adaptive batch size
training scheme using second order methods and adversarial training. These
enable increasing batch sizes earlier during training, which leads to better
training time. We extensively evaluate our method on Cifar-10/100, SVHN,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet datasets, using multiple neural networks, including
ResNets and smaller networks such as SqueezeNext. Our method exceeds the
performance of existing solutions in terms of both accuracy and the number of

achieved without any additional hyper-parameter tuning to tailor our method in

conduct accurate quantum gate operations. However, external noise limits the
computing time of physical qubits. Quantum error correction codes may extend
such limits, but imperfect gate operations introduce errors to the correction
procedure as well. The additional gate operations required due to the physical
layout of qubits exacerbate the situation. Here, we use density-matrix
simulations to investigate the performance change of logical qubits according
to quantum error correction codes and qubit layouts and the expected
performance of logical qubits with gate operation time and gate error rates.
Considering current qubit technology, the small quantum error correction codes
are chosen. Assuming 0.1% gate error probability, a logical qubit encoded by a
5-qubit quantum error correction code is expected to have a fidelity 0.25
higher than its physical counterpart.

vulnerable in various noisy scenarios. For instance, the observed reward
channel is often subject to noise in practice (e.g., when rewards are collected
through sensors), and is therefore not credible. In addition, for applications
such as robotics, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm can be
manipulated to produce arbitrary errors by receiving corrupted rewards. In this
paper, we consider noisy RL problems with perturbed rewards, which can be
approximated with a confusion matrix. We develop a robust RL framework that
enables agents to learn in noisy environments where only perturbed rewards are
observed. Our solution framework builds on existing RL/DRL algorithms and
firstly addresses the biased noisy reward setting without any assumptions on
the true distribution (e.g., zero-mean Gaussian noise as made in previous
works). The core ideas of our solution include estimating a reward confusion
matrix and defining a set of unbiased surrogate rewards. We prove the
convergence and sample complexity of our approach. Extensive experiments on
different DRL platforms show that trained policies based on our estimated
surrogate reward can achieve higher expected rewards, and converge faster than
existing baselines. For instance, the state-of-the-art PPO algorithm is able to
obtain 84.6% and 80.8% improvements on average score for five Atari games, with
error rates as 10% and 30% respectively.

phoretic phenomena to tailor interactions and direct self-assembly. We use a
photoactive component that consumes fuel, hematite, to devise phototactic
microswimmers that form self-spinning microgears following spatiotemporal light

elementary bricks of synchronized superstructures, which autonomously regulate

this capability have begun to emerge in the literature with advances in

from platform to platform, many algorithms adopt a hierarchical planning
architecture where a slow, low-fidelity global planner guides a fast,
high-fidelity local planner. However, in unknown environments, this approach
can lead to erratic or unstable behavior due to the interaction between the
global planner, whose solution is changing constantly, and the local planner; a
consequence of not capturing higher-order dynamics in the global plan. This
work proposes a planning framework in which multi-fidelity models are used to
reduce the discrepancy between the local and global planner. Our approach uses
high-, medium-, and low-fidelity models to compose a path that captures
higher-order dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. In addition,
we address the interaction between a fast planner and a slower mapper by
considering the sensor data not yet fused into the map during the collision
check. This novel mapping and planning framework for agile flights is validated
in simulation and hardware experiments, showing replanning times of 5-40 ms in

architectures. Unlike stochastic errors, these errors can combine
constructively and grow into highly detrimental overrotations. To combat this,
we introduce a simple technique for suppressing systematic coherent errors in
low-density parity-check (LDPC) stabilizer codes, which we call stabilizer
slicing. The essential idea is to slice low-weight stabilizers into two
equally-weighted Pauli operators and then apply them by rotating in opposite
directions, causing their overrotations to interfere destructively on the
logical subspace.
  With access to native gates generated by 3-body Hamiltonians, we can
completely eliminate purely coherent overrotation errors, and for overrotation
noise of 0.99 unitarity we achieve a 135-fold improvement in the logical error
rate of Surface-17. For more conventional 2-body ion trap gates, we observe an
89-fold improvement for Bacon-Shor-13 with purely coherent errors which should
be testable in near-term fault-tolerance experiments. This second scheme takes
advantage of the prepared gauge degrees of freedom, and to our knowledge is the
first example in which the state of the gauge directly affects the robustness
of a code's memory. This work demonstrates that coherent noise is preferable to
stochastic noise within certain code and gate implementations when the
coherence is utilized effectively.

extended to spheres by Apfelbaum-Sharir: given a set $P$ of $m$ points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ and some $\beta\in(0,1)$, a $(d-1)$-dimensional sphere (or a
$(d-1)$-sphere) $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is called $\beta$-nondegenerate with
respect to $P$ if $S$ does not contain a proper subsphere $S'$ such that
$|S'\cap P|\geq \beta|S\cap P|$. Apfelbaum-Sharir found an upper bound for the
number of incidences between points and nondegenerate spheres in three
dimensions, which was recently used by Zahl to obtain the best known bound for
the unit distance problem in three dimensions.
  In this paper, we show that the number of incidences between $m$ points and
$n$ $\beta$-nondegenerate 3-spheres in $\mathbb{R}^4$ is
$O_{\beta,\varepsilon}\left(m^{\frac{15}{19}+\varepsilon}
n^{\frac{16}{19}}+mn^{\frac{2}{3}}\right)$. As a consequence, we obtain a bound
of $O_{\varepsilon}(n^{2+4/11+\varepsilon})$ on the number of similar triangles
formed by $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^4$, an improvement over the previously best
known bound $O(n^{2+2/5})$.
  While proving this, we find it convenient to work with a more general
definition of nondegeneracy: a bipartite graph $G=(P,Q)$ is called
$\beta$-nondegenerate if $|N(q_1)\cap N(q_2)|<\beta |N(q_1)|$ for any two
distinct vertices $q_1,q_2\in Q$; here $N(q)$ denotes the set of neighbors of
$q$ and $\beta$ is some positive constant less than 1. A $\beta$-nondegenerate
graph can have up to $\Theta(|P||Q|)$ edges without any restriction, but must
have much fewer edges if the graph is semi-algebraic or has bounded
VC-dimension. We show that previous results for planes and spheres in three
dimensions still hold under this new definition, and so does our new bound for
spheres in four dimensions.

expensive for resource-constrained users. Fortunately, cloud computing provides
an alternative and economical service for resource-constrained users to
outsource their computation tasks to the cloud. However, one major concern with
outsourcing NLPs is the leakage of user's private information contained in NLP
formulations and results. Although much work has been done on
privacy-preserving outsourcing of computation tasks, little attention has been
paid to NLPs. In this paper, we for the first time investigate secure
outsourcing of general large-scale NLPs with nonlinear constraints. A secure
and efficient transformation scheme at the user side is proposed to protect
user's private information; at the cloud side, generalized reduced gradient
method is applied to effectively solve the transformed large-scale NLPs. The
proposed protocol is implemented on a cloud computing testbed. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that significant time can be saved for users and the
proposed mechanism has the potential for practical use.

  Property",,,,,"cs.CG cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider a class of constrained clustering problems of
points in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, where $d$ could be rather high. A common feature of
these problems is that their optimal clusterings no longer have the locality
property (due to the additional constraints), which is a key property required
by many algorithms for their unconstrained counterparts. To overcome the
difficulty caused by the loss of locality, we present in this paper a unified
framework, called {\em Peeling-and-Enclosing (PnE)}, to iteratively solve two
variants of the constrained clustering problems, {\em constrained $k$-means
clustering} ($k$-CMeans) and {\em constrained $k$-median clustering}
($k$-CMedian). Our framework is based on two standalone geometric techniques,
called {\em Simplex Lemma} and {\em Weaker Simplex Lemma}, for $k$-CMeans and
$k$-CMedian, respectively. The simplex lemma (or weaker simplex lemma) enables
us to efficiently approximate the mean (or median) point of an unknown set of
points by searching a small-size grid, independent of the dimensionality of the
space, in a simplex (or the surrounding region of a simplex), and thus can be
used to handle high dimensional data. If $k$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ are fixed
numbers, our framework generates, in nearly linear time ({\em i.e.,} $O(n(\log
n)^{k+1}d)$), $O((\log n)^{k})$ $k$-tuple candidates for the $k$ mean or median
points, and one of them induces a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for $k$-CMeans
or $k$-CMedian, where $n$ is the number of points. Combining this unified
framework with a problem-specific selection algorithm (which determines the
best $k$-tuple candidate), we obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for each of
the constrained clustering problems. We expect that our technique will be
applicable to other constrained clustering problems without locality.

appear inherited from ECAs yet bypassed genomes of our closest evolutionary
relatives, presumably due to the incomplete lineage sorting and/or

HSRS associated with development and functions of human brain. Common genomic
loci that may contributed to speciation during evolution of Great Apes comprise
248 insertions sites of African Great Ape-specific retrovirus PtERV1 (45.9%; p

HSRS associated with human-specific (HS) changes of gene expression in cerebral

candidate HSRS associated with HS expression changes in both excitatory neurons

acceleration grew out of a variational interpretation of momentum methods, such

views acceleration methods as equations of motion for a generalized Lagrangian
action. Its application to convex variational problems yields equations of
motion in the form of a damped nonlinear wave equation rather than nonlinear
diffusion arising from gradient descent. These accelerated PDE's can be
efficiently solved with simple explicit finite difference schemes where
acceleration is realized by an improvement in the CFL condition from $dt\sim

populations of the 3p-4s (multiplet number 2) levels involved in the Mg I b
line transitions assuming non-local thermodynamic conditions and considering
only the Zeeman effect using the field-free approximation. We test this
simplified atom against more complex ones finding that, although there are
differences in the computed profiles, they are small compared with the
advantages provided by the simple atom in terms of speed and robustness. After
comparing the three Mg I lines, we conclude that the most capable one is the b2
line as b1 forms at similar heights and always show weaker polarization signals
while b4 is severely blended with photospheric lines. We also compare Mg I b2
with the K I D1 and Ca II 8542 A lines finding that the former is sensitive to
the atmospheric parameters at heights that are in between those covered by the
latter two lines. This makes Mg I b2 an excellent candidate for future

integrate high-performance deep learning-based computer vision algorithms with
low-resource and low-power devices by leveraging the computing power of the
cloud. By offloading the computation work to the cloud, no dedicated hardware
is needed to enable deep neural networks on existing low computing power

power of using cloud computing to perform real-time vision tasks. Furthermore,
to reduce latency and improve real-time performance, compression algorithms are

  Random Matrix Theory and Implications for Learning","59 pages, 31 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Random Matrix Theory (RMT) is applied to analyze weight matrices of Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs), including both production quality, pre-trained models
such as AlexNet and Inception, and smaller models trained from scratch, such as
LeNet5 and a miniature-AlexNet. Empirical and theoretical results clearly
indicate that the DNN training process itself implicitly implements a form of
Self-Regularization. The empirical spectral density (ESD) of DNN layer matrices
displays signatures of traditionally-regularized statistical models, even in
the absence of exogenously specifying traditional forms of explicit
regularization. Building on relatively recent results in RMT, most notably its
extension to Universality classes of Heavy-Tailed matrices, we develop a theory
to identify 5+1 Phases of Training, corresponding to increasing amounts of
Implicit Self-Regularization. These phases can be observed during the training
process as well as in the final learned DNNs. For smaller and/or older DNNs,
this Implicit Self-Regularization is like traditional Tikhonov regularization,
in that there is a ""size scale"" separating signal from noise. For
state-of-the-art DNNs, however, we identify a novel form of Heavy-Tailed
Self-Regularization, similar to the self-organization seen in the statistical
physics of disordered systems. This results from correlations arising at all
size scales, which arises implicitly due to the training process itself. This
implicit Self-Regularization can depend strongly on the many knobs of the
training process. By exploiting the generalization gap phenomena, we
demonstrate that we can cause a small model to exhibit all 5+1 phases of
training simply by changing the batch size. This demonstrates that---all else
being equal---DNN optimization with larger batch sizes leads to less-well
implicitly-regularized models, and it provides an explanation for the
generalization gap phenomena.

continuous current running in metallic micro-wires fabricated on an
electrically insulating diamond substrate. A layer of nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
centres engineered near the diamond surface is employed to obtain spatial maps
of the vector magnetic field, by measuring Zeeman shifts through
optically-detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The in-plane magnetic field
(i.e. parallel to the diamond surface) is found to be significantly weaker than
predicted, while the out-of-plane field also exhibits an unexpected modulation.
We show that the measured magnetic field is incompatible with Ampere's
circuital law or Gauss's law for magnetism when we assume that the current is
confined to the metal, independent of the details of the current density. This
result was reproduced in several diamond samples, with a measured deviation
from Ampere's law by as much as 94(6)\%. To resolve this apparent magnetic
anomaly, we introduce a generalised description whereby the current is allowed
to flow both above the NV sensing layer (including in the metallic wire) and
below the NV layer (i.e. in the diamond). Inversion of the Biot-Savart law
within this two-channel description leads to a unique solution for the two
current densities, which completely explains the data, is consistent with the
laws of classical electrodynamics and indicates a total NV-measured current
that closely matches the electrically-measured current. However, this
description also leads to the surprising conclusion that in certain
circumstances the majority of the current appears to flow in the diamond
substrate rather than in the metallic wire, and to spread laterally in the
diamond by several micrometres away from the wire. No electrical conduction was
observed between nearby test wires, ruling out a conventional conductivity
effect. [...]

rule directly established for protection of the land system against the
satellite system or the like, and hence the evaluation of the potential impact
on the incumbent land systems becomes difficult if not impossible. A method
adopted in the current analysis is to place general restrictions on the
emissions from the satellite stations inferred from the existing regulatory
rules for interference protection between land systems specified by ITU and
ECC. The restrictions are expressed in terms of values of maximum allowed power
flux density (PFD) emitted by any space stations to the surface of the Earth at
all possible incident angles in a reference bandwidth that serves as a
protection mask for the land system such that the actual interference that the
land system experiences is no worse than that from another land mobile system
permitted by these regulations. This article examines the regulatory

plays the roles of both defectives items and inhibitor items. Since the number

after junction of two semi-infinite sub-systems held at different temperatures.
The ensuing dynamics is studied by analysing the space-time profiles of local
observables emerging at large distances $x$ and times $t$, as a function of
$\zeta = x/t$. At equilibrium, the system displays two distinct species of
quasi-particles, naturally associated with different physical degrees of
freedom. By employing the generalised hy- drodynamic approach, we show that
when the temperatures are finite no notion of separation can be attributed to
the quasi-particles. In this case the profiles can not be qualitatively
distinguished by those associated to quasi-particles of a single species that
can form bound states. On the contrary, signatures of separation emerge in the
low-temperature regime, where two distinct characteristic ve- locities appear.
In this regime, we analytically show that the profiles display a piece-wise
constant form and can be understood in terms of two decoupled Luttinger
liquids.

the learning class is the linear span of localized bases, that does not satisfy

distortion framework. In this model, we assume that agents submit full rankings
over the alternatives, and these rankings are generated from underlying, but
unknown, quantitative costs. The \emph{distortion} of a social choice rule is
then the ratio of the total social cost of the chosen alternative to the
optimal social cost of any alternative; since the true costs are unknown, we
consider the worst-case distortion over all possible underlying costs.
Analogously, we can consider the worst-case \emph{fairness ratio} of a social
choice rule by comparing a useful notion of fairness (based on approximate
majorization) for the chosen alternative to that of the optimal alternative.
With an additional metric assumption -- that the costs equal the
agent-alternative distances in some metric space -- it is known that the
Copeland rule achieves both a distortion and fairness ratio of at most 5. For
other rules, only bounds on the distortion are known, e.g., the popular Single
Transferable Vote (STV) rule has distortion $O(\log m)$, where $m$ is the
number of alternatives. We prove that the distinct notions of distortion and
fairness ratio are in fact closely linked -- within an additive factor of 2 for
any voting rule -- and thus STV also achieves an $O(\log m)$ fairness ratio. We
further extend the notions of distortion and fairness ratio to social choice
rules choosing a \emph{set} of alternatives. By relating the distortion of
single-winner rules to multiple-winner rules, we establish that Recursive
Copeland achieves a distortion of 5 and a fairness ratio of at most 7 for
choosing a set of alternatives.

regaining popularity thanks to missions with high media coverage. Future space
exploration and space station missions will require specific networks to
interconnect Earth with other objects and planets in the solar system. The
interconnections of these networks form the core of an Interplanetary Internet
(IPN). More specifically, we consider the IPN as the combination of physical
infrastructure, network architecture, and technologies to provide communication
and navigation services for missions and further applications. Compared to the
current implementation of the Internet, nodes composing the core of the IPN are
highly heterogeneous (base stations on planets, satellites etc.). Moreover,
nodes are in constant motion over intersecting elliptical planes, which results
in highly variable delays and even temporary unavailability of parts of the
network. As such, an IPN has to overcome the challenges of conventional
opportunistic networks, with much higher latency and jitter (from a couple of
minutes to several days) and the additional constraint of long-term autonomous
operations. In this paper, we highlight the challenges of IPN, demonstrate the
elements to deploy within the areas of interest, and propose the technologies
to handle deep space communication. We provide recommendations for an
evolutionary IPN implementation, coherent with specific milestones of space
exploration.

irrotational. We show that the zero-frequency limit of the Regge-Wheeler

irrotational fluid, and are expected to be the most appropriate to describe

The goal is to reconstruct a signal from quadratic measurements encoded with a
finite precision, which is indeed the case in many practical applications. We
develop a rank-1 projection algorithm that recovers the signal subject to
ensuring consistency with the measurement, that is, the recovered signal when
encoded must yield the same set of measurements that one started with. The
rank-1 projection stems from the idea of lifting, originally proposed in the
context of PhaseLift. The consistency criterion is enforced using a one-sided
quadratic cost. We also determine the probability with which different vectors
lead to the same set of quantized measurements, which makes it impossible to
resolve them. Naturally, this probability depends on how correlated such
vectors are, and how coarsely/finely the measurements get quantized. The
proposed algorithm is also capable of incorporating a sparsity constraint on
the signal. An analysis of the cost function reveals that it is bounded, both
above and below, by functions that are dependent on how well correlated the
estimate is with the ground truth. We also derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound
(CRB) on the achievable reconstruction accuracy. A comparison with the
state-of-the- art algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm has a higher
reconstruction accuracy and is about 2 to 3 dB away from the CRB. The edge, in
terms of the reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio, over the competing
algorithms is higher (about 5 to 6 dB) when the quantization is coarse.

complex variables) of MHD waves obtained from the linearized MHD equations of
an incompressible plasma for the macrospicule and cool ($\beta = 0$, rate of
the plasma to the magnetic pressure) plasma for its environment. This
dispersion equation is solved numerically at appropriate input parameters to
find out an instability region or window that accommodates suitable unstable
wavelengths on the order of the macro\-spicule width. It is established that an
$m = 52$ MHD mode propagating in a macro\-spicule with width of $6$~Mm, axial
velocity of $75$~km\,s$^{-1}$, and rotating one of $40$~km\,s$^{-1}$ can become
unstable against the KHI with instability growth times of $2.2$ and $0.57$~min
at $3$ and $5$~Mm unstable wavelengths, respectively. These growth times are
much shorter than the macrospicule lifetime, which lasts about $15$~min. An
increase or decease in the width of the jet would change the KHI growth times,
which remain more or less on the same order when they are evaluated at
wavelengths equal to the width or radius of the macrospicule. It is worth
noting that the excited MHD modes are super-Alfv\'enic waves. A change in the
background magnetic field can lead to another MHD mode number $m$ that ensures
the required instability window.

in contrast to quantum ones. Here, employing their master equation, we
successfully extend the Floquet methodology to classical EOMs to obtain their
Floquet-Magnus expansions, thereby overcoming this difficulty. Our method has a
wide range of application from classical to quantum as long as they are
described by differential equations including the Langevin equation, the

analytically evaluating the higher-order terms of the Floquet-Magnus expansion,
we find that it is, at least asymptotically, convergent and well approximates

call the concept target-aware transfer learning. Given only small-scale labeled
data, and starting from an ImageNet pre-trained network, we exploit a scheme of
removing its potential redundancy for the target task through iterative
operations of filter-wise pruning and network optimization. The basic
motivation is that compact networks are on one hand more efficient and should
also be more tolerant, being less complex, against the risk of overfitting
which would hinder the generalization of learned representations in the context
of transfer learning. Further, unlike existing methods involving network
simplification, we also let the scheme identify redundant portions across the
entire network, which automatically results in a network structure adapted to
the task at hand. We achieve this with a few novel ideas: (i) cumulative sum of
activation statistics for each layer, and (ii) a priority evaluation of pruning
across multiple layers. Experimental results by the method on five datasets

MPC), to preserve the privacy of the patient records and the confidentiality of
the clinicians' decisions.
  Results: Our solution enables to compute the effectiveness measure of a
treatment based on patient records, while preserving privacy. Moreover,
clinicians are not burdened with the computational and communication costs
introduced by the privacy-preserving techniques that are used. Our system is
able to compute the effectiveness of 100 treatments for a specific patient in
less than 24 minutes, querying a database containing 20,000 patient records.
  Conclusion: This paper presents a novel and efficient clinical decision
support system, that harnesses the potential and insights acquired from
treatment data, while preserving the privacy of patient records and the
confidentiality of clinician decisions.

mimicking raw video demonstrations. Previous methods in this domain rely on
extracting low-dimensional features from expert videos followed by a separate
hand-crafted reward estimation step. We propose an imitation learning framework
that reduces the dependence on hand-engineered reward functions by jointly
learning the feature extraction and reward estimation steps using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our main contribution in this paper is to show
that under injective mapping between low-level joint state (angles and
velocities) trajectories and corresponding raw video stream, performing
adversarial imitation learning on video demonstrations is equivalent to
learning from the state trajectories. Experimental results show that the
proposed adversarial learning method from raw videos produces a similar
performance to state-of-the-art imitation learning techniques while frequently
outperforming existing hand-crafted video imitation methods. Furthermore, we
show that our method can learn action policies by imitating video

$H$ (also called $H$-colourings) asks: given two $H$-colourings $f$ of $g$ of a
graph $G$, is it possible to transform $f$ into $g$ by a sequence of
single-vertex colour changes such that every intermediate mapping is an
$H$-colouring? This problem is known to be polynomial-time solvable for a wide
variety of graphs $H$ (e.g. all $C_4$-free graphs) but only a handful of hard
cases are known. We prove that this problem is PSPACE-complete whenever $H$ is
a $K_{2,3}$-free quadrangulation of the $2$-sphere (equivalently, the plane)
which is not a $4$-cycle. From this result, we deduce an analogous statement
for non-bipartite $K_{2,3}$-free quadrangulations of the projective plane. This
include several interesting classes of graphs, such as odd wheels, for which
the complexity was known, and $4$-chromatic generalized Mycielski graphs, for
which it was not.
  If we instead consider graphs $G$ and $H$ with loops on every vertex (i.e.
reflexive graphs), then the reconfiguration problem is defined in a similar way
except that a vertex can only change its colour to a neighbour of its current
colour. In this setting, we use similar ideas to show that the reconfiguration
problem for $H$-colourings is PSPACE-complete whenever $H$ is a reflexive
$K_{4}$-free triangulation of the $2$-sphere which is not a reflexive triangle.
This proof applies more generally to reflexive graphs which, roughly speaking,
resemble a triangulation locally around a particular vertex. This provides the
first graphs for which $H$-Recolouring is known to be PSPACE-complete for
reflexive instances.

is crucial for the survival of microorganisms. It allows them to find food and
to escape from toxins. Many microorganisms can produce the chemicals to which
they respond themselves and use chemotaxis for signalling which can be seen as
a basic form of communication. Remarkably, the past decade has let to the
development of synthetic microswimmers like e.g. autophoretic Janus colloids,
which can self-propel through a solvent, analogously to bacteria and other
microorganims. The mechanism underlying their self-propulsion involves the
production of certain chemicals. The same chemicals involved in the
self-propulsion mechanism also act on other microswimmers and bias their
swimming direction towards (or away from) the producing microswimmer. Synthetic
microswimmers therefore provide a synthetic analogue to chemotactic motile
microorganisms. When these interactions are attractive, they commonly lead to
clusters, even at low particle density. These clusters may either proceed
towards macrophase separation, resembling Dictyostelium aggregation, or, as
shown very recently, lead to dynamic clusters of self-limited size (dynamic
clustering) as seen in experiments in autophoretic Janus colloids. Besides the
classical case where chemical interactions are attractive, this Account
discusses, as its main focus, repulsive chemical interactions, which can create
a new and less known avenue to pattern formation in active systems leading to a
variety of pattern, including clusters which are surrounded by shells of
chemicals, travelling waves and more complex continously reshaping patterns. In
all these cases `synthetic signalling' can crucially determine the collective
behavior of synthetic microswimmer ensembles and can be used as a design
principle to create patterns in motile active particles.

the unconstrained min-min optimization of the p-Wasserstein distance between

reconstruction error. We also identify the role of its trade-off hyperparameter
as the capacity of the generator: its Lipschitz constant. Moreover, we prove
that optimizing the encoder over any class of universal approximators, such as
deterministic neural networks, is enough to come arbitrarily close to the
optimum. We therefore advertise this framework, which holds for any metric
space and prior, as a sweet-spot of current generative autoencoding objectives.
We then introduce the Sinkhorn auto-encoder (SAE), which approximates and
minimizes the p-Wasserstein distance in latent space via backprogation through
the Sinkhorn algorithm. SAE directly works on samples, i.e. it models the
aggregated posterior as an implicit distribution, with no need for a
reparameterization trick for gradients estimations. SAE is thus able to work
with different metric spaces and priors with minimal adaptations. We
demonstrate the flexibility of SAE on latent spaces with different geometries

  structures",,,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Humans learn complex latent structures from their environments (e.g., natural
language, mathematics, music, social hierarchies). In cognitive science and
cognitive neuroscience, models that infer higher-order structures from sensory
or first-order representations have been proposed to account for the complexity
and flexibility of human behavior. But how do the structures that these models
invoke arise in neural systems in the first place? To answer this question, we
explain how a system can learn latent representational structures (i.e.,
predicates) from experience with wholly unstructured data. During the process
of predicate learning, an artificial neural network exploits the naturally
occurring dynamic properties of distributed computing across neuronal
assemblies in order to learn predicates, but also to combine them
compositionally, two computational aspects which appear to be necessary for
human behavior as per formal theories in multiple domains. We describe how
predicates can be combined generatively using neural oscillations to achieve
human-like extrapolation and compositionality in an artificial neural network.
The ability to learn predicates from experience, to represent structures
compositionally, and to extrapolate to unseen data offers an inroads to
understanding and modeling the most complex human behaviors.

of spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes, which is known
to yield close-tooptimal decoding results when compared to full belief
propagation (BP) decoding. However, a drawback of windowed decoding is that
either a significant amount of window updates are required leading to
unnecessary high decoding complexity or the decoder suffers from sporadic
burst-like error patterns, causing a decoder stall. To tackle this effect and,
thus, to reduce the average decoding complexity, the basic idea is to enable
adaptive window shifts based on a bit error rate (BER) prediction, which
reduces the amount of unnecessary updates. As the decoder stall does not occur
in analytical investigations such as the density evolution (DE), we examine
different schemes on a fixed test-set and exhaustive monte-carlo simulations
based on our graphic processing unit (GPU) simulation framework. As a result,
we can reduce the average decoding complexity of the naive windowed decoder
while improving the BER performance when compared to a non-adaptive windowed
decoding scheme. Furthermore, we show that a foresightful stall prediction does
not significantly outperform a retrospective stall detection which is much
easier to implement in practice.

virtualized environment. Steal time measures the amount of time the processor
is preempted by code outside the virtualized environment. This, in turn, allows
to compute accurately the execution time of an application inside a virtual
machine (i.e. it eliminates the time the virtual machine is suspended).
Unfortunately, this metric is only available in particular scenarios in which
the host and the guest OS are tightly coupled. Typical examples are the Xen
hypervisor and Linux-based guest OSes. In contrast, in scenarios where the
steal time is not available inside the virtualized environment, performance
measurements are, most often, incorrect.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel and platform agnostic approach to
calculate this steal time within the virtualized environment and without the
cooperation of the host OS. The theoretical execution time of a deterministic
microbenchmark is compared to its execution time in a virtualized environment.
When factoring in the virtual machine load, this solution -as simple as it is-
can compute the steal time. The preliminary results show that we are able to
compute the load of the physical processor within the virtual machine with high
accuracy.

subsystem operator who performs the design of a retrofit controller, the
subsystems managed by all other operators can be regarded as an environment,
the complete system model of which is assumed not to be available. The proposed
retrofit control with approximate environment modeling has an advantage that
the stability of the resultant control system is robustly assured regardless of
not only the stability of approximate environment models, but also the
magnitude of modeling errors, provided that the network system before
implementing retrofit control is originally stable. This robustness property is
practically significant to incorporate existing identification methods of
unknown environments, because the accuracy of identified models may neither be
reliable nor assurable in reality. Furthermore, we conduct a control
performance analysis to show that the resultant performance can be regulated by
adjusting the accuracy of approximate environment modeling. The efficiency of
the proposed retrofit control is shown by numerical experiments on a network of

environments by diversifying individual phenotypes. This observation is
quantified by the theory of bet-hedging, which provides a reason for the degree
of phenotypic diversity observed even in clonal populations. The theory of
bet-hedging in well-mixed populations is rather well developed. However, many
species underwent range expansions during their evolutionary history, and the
importance of phenotypic diversity in such scenarios still needs to be
understood. In this paper, we develop a theory of bet-hedging for populations
colonizing new, unknown environments that fluctuate either in space or time. In
this case, we find that bet-hedging is a more favorable strategy than in
well-mixed populations. For slow rates of variation, temporal and spatial
fluctuations lead to different outcomes. In spatially fluctuating environments,
bet-hedging is favored compared to temporally fluctuating environments. In the
limit of frequent environmental variation, no opportunity for bet-hedging
exists, regardless of the nature of the environmental fluctuations. For the
same model, bet-hedging is never an advantageous strategy in the well-mixed
case, supporting the view that range expansions strongly promote
diversification. These conclusions are robust against stochasticity induced by
finite population sizes. Our findings shed light on the importance of
phenotypic heterogeneity in range expansions, paving the way to novel
approaches to understand how biodiversity emerges and is maintained.

the Wang et al. spectral type that most interestingly evolves slowly, placing
it in the Low Velocity Gradient (LVG) typing of Benetti et al. Only 5% of SNe
Ia are HV and located in the SS+CN portion of the Branch diagram and less than
10% of SNe Ia are both HV and LVG. These features point towards SN 2012fr being
quite unusual, similar in many ways to the peculiar SN 2000cx. We modeled the
spectral evolution of SN 2012fr to see if we could gain some insight into its
evolutionary behavior. We use the parameterized radiative transfer code SYNOW
to probe the abundance stratification of SN 2012fr at pre-maximum, maximum, and
post-maximum light epochs. We also use a grid of W7 models in the radiative
transfer code PHOENIX to probe the effect of different density structures on
the formation of the Si II {\lambda}6355 absorption feature at post-maximum
epochs. We find that the unusual features observed in SN 2012fr are likely due
to a shell-like density enhancement in the outer ejecta. We comment on possible
reasons for atypical Ca II absorption features, and suggest that they are
related to the Si II features.

the structured prediction models, but few existing researches have studied on
utilizing such information to improve structured prediction models at the
inference stage. In this work, we propose to refine the predictions of
structured prediction models by effectively integrating discriminative models
into the prediction. Discriminative models are treated as energy-based models.
Similar to the adversarial learning, discriminative models are trained to
estimate scores which measure the quality of predicted outputs, while
structured prediction models are trained to predict contrastive outputs with
maximal energy scores. In this way, the gradient vanishing problem is
ameliorated, and thus we are able to perform inference by following the ascent
gradient directions of discriminative models to refine structured prediction
models. The proposed method is able to handle a range of tasks, e.g.,
multi-label classification and image segmentation. Empirical results on these
two tasks validate the effectiveness of our learning method.

translation from section to section typically referred to as drift. Over
multiple sections, drift compound to skew distance measures and geometric

approaches often involve standard image registration methods available in

predict the phase behavior and stability of such solutions. Here we present a
systematic study of the concentration dependence of the structural and dynamic
properties of monoclonal antibodies using a combination of different scattering
methods and microrheological experiments. To interpret these data, we use a
colloid-inspired approach based on a simple patchy model, which explicitly
takes into account the anisotropic shape and the charge distribution of the
molecules. Combining theory, simulations and experiments, we are able to
disentangle self-assembly and intermolecular interactions and to quantitatively
describe the concentration dependence of structural and dynamic quantities such
as the osmotic compressibility, the collective diffusion coefficient and the
zero shear viscosity over the entire range of investigated concentrations. This
simple patchy model not only allows us to consistently describe the
thermodynamic and dynamic behavior of mAb solutions, but also provides a robust
estimate of the attraction between their binding sites. It will thus be an
ideal starting point for future work on antibody formulations, as it provides a
quantitative assessment of the effects of additional excipients or chemical
modifications on antibody interactions, and a prediction of their effect on
solution viscosity.

challenge to the engineer designing the microfluidic networks. In today's

simplifications, as well as his/her experiences and intuitions. In order to
validate the obtained specification of the microfluidic network, usually a
prototype is fabricated and physical experiments are conducted thus far. In
case the design does not implement the desired functionality, this prototyping
iteration is repeated - obviously resulting in an expensive and time-consuming
design process. In order to avoid unnecessary prototyping loops, simulation
methods could help to validate the specification of the microfluidic network
before any prototype is fabricated. However, state-of-the-art simulation tools
come with severe limitations, which prevent their utilization for

Revised Section VIII, among other minor fixes",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) is an encryption method that allows
quantum computation to be performed on one party's private data with the
program provided by another party, without revealing much information about the
data nor about the program to the opposite party. It is known that
information-theoretically-secure QHE for circuits of unrestricted size would
require exponential resources, and efficient computationally-secure QHE schemes
for polynomial-sized quantum circuits have been constructed. In this paper we
first propose a QHE scheme for a type of circuits of polynomial depth, based on
the rebit quantum computation formalism. The scheme keeps the restricted type
of data perfectly secure. We then propose a QHE scheme for a larger class of
polynomial-depth quantum circuits, which has partial data privacy. Both schemes
have good circuit privacy. We also propose an interactive QHE scheme with
asymptotic data privacy, however, the circuit privacy is not good, in the sense
that the party who provides the data could cheat and learn about the circuit.
We show that such cheating would generally affect the correctness of the
evaluation or cause deviation from the protocol. Hence the cheating can be
caught by the opposite party in an interactive scheme with embedded
verifications. Such scheme with verification has a minor drawback in data
privacy. Finally, we show some methods which achieve some nontrivial level of
data privacy and circuit privacy without resorting to allowing early
terminations, in both the QHE problem and in secure evaluation of classical
functions. The entanglement and classical communication costs in these schemes
are polynomial in the circuit size and the security parameter (if any).

impressive results in various signal and image processing tasks. A
convolutional version of this model, termed convolutional sparse coding (CSC),
has been recently reintroduced and extensively studied. CSC brings a natural
remedy to the limitation of typical sparse enforcing approaches of handling
global and high-dimensional signals by local, patch-based, processing. While
the classic field of sparse representations has been able to cater for the
diverse challenges of different signal processing tasks by considering a wide
range of problem formulations, almost all available algorithms that deploy the
CSC model consider the same $\ell_1 - \ell_2$ problem form. As we argue in this
paper, this CSC pursuit formulation is also too restrictive as it fails to
explicitly exploit some local characteristics of the signal. This work expands
the range of formulations for the CSC model by proposing two convex
alternatives that merge global norms with local penalties and constraints. The
main contribution of this work is the derivation of efficient and provably
converging algorithms to solve these new sparse coding formulations.

enhance the network capability to improve the quality of experience (QoE) at
Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). Proactive caching, as one of the key
features offered by 5G networks, has lately received much interest. However,
more research is still needed to convey large-sized multimedia content
including video, audio and pictures to the high speed moving vehicles. In this
paper, we study the gains achieved by proactive caching in Roadside Units
(RSUs) where we take into consideration the effect of the vehicle velocity on
the optimal caching decision. Information about the user demand and mobility is
harnessed to cache some files in RSUs, which will communicate with vehicles
traversing along the visited roads before the actual demand. Our main objective
is to minimize the total network latency. Towards this objective, we formulate
two optimization problems for non-cooperative and cooperative caching schemes
to find the optimal caching policy to decide which files to be cached by the
RSUs. Due to the complexity of these problems, we propose a sub-optimal caching
policy for each scheme. We compare the performance of the optimal caching
policy to that of the sub-optimal caching policy. Numerical results show that
proactive caching has a significant performance gain when compared to the
baseline reactive scenario. Moreover, results reveal that the cooperative
caching scheme is more efficient than the non-cooperative scheme.

the 12mu luminosity, assumed as a proxy for the intrinsic X-ray luminosity,
which in Compton-thick AGN is not directly observable. One of the most popular
explanations of the classic I-T effect is the so-called receding torus model,
i.e. the decrease of the covering factor of the molecular `torus' with X-ray
luminosity. In this paper we show that an I-T effect for Compton-thick AGN is
indeed expected in the receding torus model, assuming that the torus is
funnelling the primary X-ray luminosity which is then scattered in a `hot
mirror'. We found that the observed relation is well reproduced provided that
the typical column density of the `hot mirror' is about 7.5x10^{22} cm^{-2}.

for generating entangled photon pairs. In SPDC, a pump photon interacts with a
nonlinear optical crystal and splits into two entangled photons called the
signal and the idler photons. The SPDC process has been studied extensively in
the last few decades for various pump and crystal configurations, and the
entangled photon pairs produced by SPDC have been used in numerous experimental
studies on quantum entanglement and entanglement-based real-world
quantum-information applications. In this tutorial article, we present a
thorough study of phase matching in $\beta$-barium borate (BBO) crystals for
spontaneous parametric down-conversion and thereby also investigate the
generation of entangled photons in such crystals. First, we present a
theoretical derivation of two-photon wavefunction produced by SPDC in the
frequency and transverse momentum bases. We then discuss in detail the effects
due to various crystal and pump parameters including the length of the crystal,
the angle between the optic axis and the pump propagation direction, the pump
incidence angle on the crystal surface, the refraction at the crystal surfaces,
and the pump propagation direction inside the crystal. These effects are
extremely relevant in experimental situations. We then present our numerical

parameters affect the phase matching and thus the generation of entangled
photons. Finally, using the two-photon wavefunction in the transverse

we first provide a problem-dependent upper bound on the regret of a TS
algorithm with Beta-Bernoulli updates; this upper bound is tighter than a
recent derivation under a more general setting by Huyuk and Tekin (2019). Next,
we design and analyze another TS algorithm with Gaussian updates, TS-Cascade.
TS-Cascade achieves the state-of-the-art regret bound for cascading bandits.
Complementarily, we consider a linear generalization of the cascading bandit
model, which allows efficient learning in large cascading bandit problem
instances. We introduce and analyze a TS algorithm, which enjoys a regret bound
that depends on the dimension of the linear model but not the number of items.
Finally, by using information-theoretic techniques and judiciously constructing
cascading bandit instances, we derive a nearly matching regret lower bound for
the standard model. Our paper establishes the first theoretical guarantees on
TS algorithms for stochastic combinatorial bandit problem model with partial
feedback. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TS
algorithms compared to existing UCB-based ones.

polyurea networks with varying degree of crosslinking, has been studied by
means of a thorough analysis of broadband dielectric spectroscopy measurements.
Two different relaxation processes are observed, namely, a fast process
involving the soft poly(propylene oxide) chains, and a slower and much broader
process associated to the immediate surroundings of the hard crosslinkers.
Microphase separation in soft and hard domains characterizes the systems in the
presence of hydrogen bondings. In this case, different confinement conditions
are explored by varying the soft chain length; overall, the so called
'adsorption' effects dominate. With respect to both cooperativity and
rearrangement energy threshold in fast relaxation, it is found that the
enhancement of configurational constraints is similar to cooling, but only on
qualitative grounds. An upper bound of the hard domain's interface thickness,
in which the slow relaxation is believed to take place, is estimated from the
analysis of the fast relaxation in the system characterized by the highest
degree of confinement, taking into account the results of the structural
analysis. Dropping the hydrogen bonding mechanism, phase separation does not
occur anymore and the configurational constraints at the ends of the soft
chains are reduced, leaving just those imposed by the rigid crosslinkers. This
leads to a significant increase in cooperativity, on approaching the glass
transition, and to a complex behavior that is thoroughly discussed in
comparison with those observed in the micro-segregated systems.

from the current state of ignorance about the galactic population of
non-natural electromagnetic signals, we formulate a Bayesian statistical model
to infer the mean number of radio signals crossing Earth, assuming either
non-detection or the detection of signals in future surveys of the Galaxy.
Under fairly noninformative priors, we find that not detecting signals within
about $1$ kly from Earth, while suggesting the lack of galactic emitters or at
best the scarcity thereof, is nonetheless still consistent with a probability
exceeding $10$ \% that typically over $\sim 100$ signals could be crossing
Earth, with radiated power analogous to that of the Arecibo radar, but coming
from farther in the Milky Way. The existence in the Galaxy of potentially
detectable Arecibo-like emitters can be reasonably ruled out only if all-sky

requiring detector sensitivities thousands times higher than those of current
telescopes. Conversely, finding even one Arecibo-like signal within $\sim 1000$
light years, a possibility within reach of current detectors, implies almost
certainly that typically more than $\sim 100$ signals of comparable radiated

bolometric luminosity, which are estimated by the fit. On average, 19% of the
stellar radiation is absorbed by dust in DustPedia galaxies. The fraction rises
to 25% if only late-type galaxies are considered. The dependence of f_abs on
morphology, showing a peak for Sb-Sc galaxies, is weak; it reflects a stronger,
yet broad, positive correlation with the bolometric luminosity, which is
identified for late-type, disk-dominated, high-specific-star-formation rate,
gas-rich objects. We find no variation of f_abs with inclination, at odds with
radiative transfer models of edge-on galaxies. These results call for a
self-consistent modelling of the evolution of the dust mass and geometry along
the build-up of the stellar content. We also provide template spectral energy
distributions in bins of morphology and luminosity and study the variation of
f_abs with stellar mass and specific star formation rate. We confirm that the

particularly the high-dimensional posterior distributions in PDE-constrained
inverse problems. This paper develops a sampler for arbitrary continuous
multivariate distributions that is based on low-rank surrogates in the
tensor-train format. We construct a tensor-train approximation to the target
probability density function using the cross interpolation, which requires a
small number of function evaluations. For sufficiently smooth distributions the
storage required for the TT approximation is moderate, scaling linearly with
dimension. The structure of the tensor-train surrogate allows efficient
sampling by the conditional distribution method. Unbiased estimates may be
calculated by correcting the transformed random seeds using a
Metropolis--Hastings accept/reject step. Moreover, one can use a more efficient
quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature that may be corrected either by a control-variate
strategy, or by importance weighting. We show that the error in the
tensor-train approximation propagates linearly into the Metropolis--Hastings
rejection rate and the integrated autocorrelation time of the resulting Markov
chain. These methods are demonstrated in three computed examples: fitting
failure time of shock absorbers; a PDE-constrained inverse diffusion problem;
and sampling from the Rosenbrock distribution. The delayed rejection adaptive
Metropolis (DRAM) algorithm is used as a benchmark. We find that the
importance-weight corrected quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature performs best in all
computed examples, and is orders-of-magnitude more efficient than DRAM across a
wide range of approximation accuracies and sample sizes. Indeed, all the
methods developed here significantly outperform DRAM in all computed examples.

preemptive context where jobs may be preempted but not parallelized, as well as
the splittable context where jobs may be preempted and parallelized.
  We present the first algorithm improving the previously best approximation
ratio of $2$ to a better ratio of $3/2$ in the preemptive case. In more detail,
for all three flavors we present an approximation ratio $2$ with running time
$\mathcal{O}(n)$, ratio $3/2+\varepsilon$ in time $\mathcal{O}(n\log

All-sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey, which is a continuum survey conducted using the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). This instrument is the precursor telescope for
the low-frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array, and allows us to
select radio galaxies in an orientation-independent way (i.e. minimising the
bias caused by Doppler boosting, inherent in high-frequency surveys). Being
brighter than 4 Jy at 151 MHz, we refer to these objects as the GLEAM 4-Jy
(G4Jy) Sample. The G4Jy catalogue is close to being finalised, with SVW
describing how multi-wavelength data have been used to determine the morphology
of the radio emission, and identify the host galaxy. In addition, the MWA's
excellent spectral-coverage and sensitivity to extended/diffuse emission were
highlighted. Both of these aspects are important for understanding the physical
mechanisms that take place within active galaxies, and how they interact with
their environment.

such a spin-dependent (inverse) spin Hall effect is found in the ferromagnetic

Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). Since then, three VLBI missions operated
in Space thus enabling baselines longer than the Earth diameter. These are the
Tracking and Data Relay Satellite Orbital VLBI experiment (1986 - 1988), the
VLBI Space Observatory Program (VSOP, 1997 - 2003) and RadioAstron (2011 -
present time). These Space VLBI (SVLBI) systems enabled studies of celestial
radio sources with an unprecedentedly sharp angular resolution reaching 0.1
nanoradian (tens of microarcseconds) and sharper. The first generation SVLBI
missions provided cutting-edge results in several topics of modern radio
astronomy. These include discoveries of ultra-compact galactic hydroxyl and
water vapor masers, radio emission in active galactic nuclei with the
brightness exceeding conventional theoretical limits, and detection of pulsar
emission at meter wavelengths shedding a new light on the properties of the
interstellar medium. One of the Space VLBI missions, the RadioAstron, also
ventured into the domain of fundamental physics by sing its onboard Hydrogen
maser local oscillators for experimental verification of the Einstein
Equivalence Principle. The paper provides a brief review these discoveries and
lessons learned over the first half a century of Space VLBI. This comparison,
together with the review of technological achievements of the three SLBI
missions, creates a fundament for projecting the development of space-based
radio interferometry into the next decades.

corresponds to the formation of a giant cluster inside one layer, and has a
well defined percolation threshold. The abrupt transition instead corresponds
to the merger of coexisting giant clusters among different layers, and is
characterised by a remarkable uncertainty in the percolation threshold, which
in turns causes an anomalous trend in the observed susceptibility. We develop a
simple mathematical model able to describe this phenomenon and to estimate the
critical threshold for which the abrupt transition is more likely to occur.
Remarkably, finite-size scaling analysis in the abrupt region supports the

the group field theory Lagrangian gives a relational Hamiltonian. In the
classical theory, it is natural to define 'equal relational time' Poisson
brackets, where 'equal time' corresponds to equal values of the scalar field
clock. The quantum theory can then be defined by imposing 'equal relational
time' commutation relations for the fundamental operators of the theory, with
the states being elements of a Fock space with their evolution determined by
the relational Hamiltonian operator. A particularly interesting family of
states are condensates, as they are expected to correspond to the cosmological
sector of group field theory. For the relational Hamiltonian considered in this
paper, the coarse-grained dynamics of a simple type of condensate states agree
exactly with the Friedmann equations in the classical limit, and also include
quantum gravity corrections that ensure the big-bang singularity is replaced by
a bounce.

  spectra and spectral classes of chemically-homogeneously evolving stars","Accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics.

Metal-poor massive stars are supposed to be progenitors of certain
supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and compact object mergers, potentially
contributing to the early epochs of the Universe with their strong ionizing
radiation. However, they remain mainly theoretical as individual spectroscopic
observations of such objects have rarely been carried out below the metallicity
of the SMC.
  Aims. This work aims at exploring what our state-of-the-art theories of
stellar evolution combined with those of stellar atmospheres predict about a
certain type of metal-poor (0.02 Z$_{\odot}$) hot massive stars, the chemically
homogeneously evolving ones, called TWUIN stars.
  Methods. Synthetic spectra corresponding to a broad range in masses (20-130
M$_{\odot}$) and covering several evolutionary phases from the zero-age
main-sequence up to the core helium-burning stage were computed.
  Results. We find that TWUIN stars show almost no emission lines during most
of their {core hydrogen-burning} lifetimes. Most metal lines are completely
absent, including nitrogen. During their core helium-burning stage, lines
switch to emission and even some metal lines (oxygen and carbon, but still
almost no nitrogen) show up. Mass loss and clumping play a significant role in
line-formation in later evolutionary phases, particularly during core
helium-burning. Most of our spectra are classified as an early O type giant or
supergiant, and we find Wolf-Rayet stars of type WO in the core helium-burning
phase.
  Conclusions. An extremely hot, early O type star observed in a
low-metallicity galaxy could be the outcome of chemically homogeneous evolution
$-$ and therefore the progenitor of a long-duration gamma-ray burst or a type
Ic supernova. TWUIN stars may play an important role in reionizing the Universe
due to their being hot without showing prominent emission lines during the
majority of their lifetimes.

X-ray binary 4U 1630-47, observed with the AstroSat, Chandra and MAXI space
missions during its soft X-ray outburst in 2016. The outburst, from the rising
phase until the peak, is neither detected in hard X-rays (15-50 keV) by the
Swift/BAT nor in radio. Such non-detection along with the source behavior in
the hardness-intensity and color-color diagrams obtained using MAXI data
confirm that both Chandra and AstroSat observations were performed during the
high soft spectral state. The High Energy Grating (HEG) spectrum from the
Chandra high-energy transmission grating spectrometer (HETGS) shows two strong,
moderately blueshifted absorption lines at 6.705$_{-0.002}^{+0.002}$ keV and
6.974$_{-0.003}^{+0.004}$ keV, which are produced by Fe XXV and Fe XXVI in a
low-velocity ionized disk wind. The corresponding outflow velocity is
determined to be 366$\pm$56 km/s. Separate spectral fits of Chandra/HEG,
AstroSat/SXT+LAXPC and Chandra/HEG + AstroSat/SXT+LAXPC data show that the
broadband continuum can be well described with a relativistic disk-blackbody
model, with the disk flux fraction of $\sim 0.97$. Based on the best-fit
continuum spectral modeling of Chandra, AstroSat and Chandra+AstroSat joint
spectra and using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, we constrain the
spectral hardening factor at 1.56$^{+0.14}_{-0.06}$ and the dimensionless black
hole spin parameter at 0.92 $\pm$ 0.04 within the 99.7% confidence interval.
Our conclusion of a rapidly-spinning black hole in 4U 1630-47 using the

density along $\mathcal{C}$ and of the shape of $\mathcal{C}$ itself. The
formalism is specifically developed for Stuart-Landau oscillators, but it is
general enough to be applied to other classes of amplitude oscillators. The
main achievements consist in: (i) identification and characterization of a new
transition to self-consistent partial synchrony (SCPS), which confirms the
crucial role played by higher Fourier hamonics in the coupling function; (ii)
an analytical treatment of SCPS, including a detailed stability analysis; (iii)
the discovery of a new form of collective chaos, which can be seen as a

Einsteinian (Schwarzschild or Kerr) black hole everywhere except a small region
near its surface should have the ringdown profile predicted by the Einstein
theory at early and intermediate times, but modified by the so-called echoes at
late times. A similar phenomenon appears when one considers an Einsteinian
black hole and a shell of matter placed at some distance from it, so that
astrophysical estimates could be made for the allowed mass of the black hole
environment. While echoes for both systems have been extensively studied
recently, no such analysis has been done for a system featuring phenomena
simultaneously, that is, echoes due to new physics near the surface/event
horizon and echoes due to matter at some distance from the black hole. Here,
following [9, 11], we consider a traversable wormhole obtained by identifying
two Schwarzschild metrics with the same mass M at the throat, which is near the
Schwarzschild radius, and add a nonthin shell of matter at a distance. This
allows us to understand how the echoes of the surface of the compact object are
affected by the astrophysical environment at a distance. The straightforward
calculations for the time-domain profiles of such a system support the
expectations that if the echoes are observed, they should most probably be
ascribed to some new physics near the event horizon rather than some

Tawn (2013), proposed a statistical model which is in compliance with extreme

peaks over thresholds (POT), Beirlant et al. (2002, 2009) constructed models
that can be viewed as special cases from both approaches discussed above. When
fitting such second order models it turns out that the bias of the resulting
extreme value estimators is significantly reduced compared to the classical
tail fits using only the first order tail component based on the Pareto or
generalized Pareto fits to peaks over threshold distributions. In this paper we
provide novel bias reduced tail fitting techniques, improving upon the
classical generalized Pareto (GP) approximation for POTs using the flexible

exploits the relation between the original and sample in-degree distributions,

an asymptotic approach, which itself has two versions: one assuming a power-law

are examined on synthetic and real networks, with good performance results,

state features divergences as a consequence of the rapid growth of the density
of states with energy. Introducing a high energy cutoff $\Lambda$, the
transient dynamics during a time scale $\simeq 1/\Lambda$ describes the
renormalization of the bare into a `quasiparticle' state which decays on longer
time scales. During this early transient the decay law features Zeno behavior
$e^{-(t/t_Z)^2}$ with the Zeno time-scale $t_Z \propto 1/\Lambda^{3/2}$. We
introduce a dynamical renormalization framework that allows to separate
consistently the dynamics of formation of the quasiparticle state and its decay
on longer time scales by introducing a renormalization time scale along with
alternative `schemes'. The survival probability obeys a renormalization group
equation with respect to this scale. We find a transient \emph{suppression} of
the decay law for large Lorentz factor as a consequence of the narrowing of the
phase space for decay different from the usual time dilation. In presence of
higher mass thresholds, the energy uncertainty associated with transient
dynamics leads to an \emph{anti Zeno enhancement} with a transient acceleration
of the decay into \emph{heavier particles}. There remains memory of the
transient effects in the survival probability even at long time. We discuss
possible consequences of these effects in cosmology.

polymorphs, referred to as $1T$ and $1H$, depending on the coordination sphere
of the transition metal atom. The broken octahedral and trigonal prismatic
symmetries lead to different crystal and ligand field splittings of the $d$
electron states, resulting in distinct electronic properties. In this work, we
quantify the crystal and ligand field parameters of two-dimensional TMDs using
a Wannier-function approach. We adopt the methodology proposed by Scaramucci et
al. [A. Scaramucci et al., J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 27, 175503 (2015)]. that
allows to separate various contributions to the ligand field by choosing
different manifolds in the construction of the Wannier functions. We discuss
the relevance of the crystal and ligand fields in determining the relative
stability of the two polymorphs as a function of the filling of the $d$-shell.
Based on the calculated parameters, we conclude that the ligand field, while
leading to a small stabilizing factor for the $1H$ polymorph in the $d^1$ and
$d^2$ TMDs, plays mostly an indirect role and that hybridization between
different $d$ orbitals is the dominant feature. We investigate trends across
the periodic table and interpret the variations of the calculated crystal and
ligand fields in terms of the change of charge-transfer energy, which allows
developing simple chemical intuition.

Riemann zeta function, where we think of the character n^{it} as ramified at
the infinite place). We represent the moment as a sum of traces of Frobenius on

hypothesis on the vanishing of some of these cohomology groups, we calculate
the moments of the L-function and they match the predictions of the

  In this case, the decomposition into irreducible representations seems to
separate the main term and error term, which are mixed together in the long
sums obtained from the approximate functional equation, even when it is
dyadically decomposed. This makes our heuristic statement relatively simple,
once the geometric background is set up. We hope that this will clarify the
situation in more difficult cases like the L-functions of quadratic Dirichlet
characters to squarefree modulus. There is also some hope for a geometric proof
of this cohomological hypothesis, which would resolve the moment problem for
these L-functions in the large degree limit over function fields.

Higgs and the Higgsed gauge bosons are governed by effective masses that scale
differently with the nonminimal couplings and evolve differently in time.
Coupled metric perturbations enhance Higgs self-resonance and make it possible
for Higgs inflation to preheat solely through this channel. For $\xi\gtrsim
100$ the total energy of the Higgs-inflaton condensate can be transferred to
Higgs particles within $3$ $e$-folds after the end of inflation. For smaller
values of the nonminimal coupling preheating takes longer, completely shutting
off at around $\xi\simeq 30$. The production of gauge bosons is dominated by
the gauge boson mass and the field space curvature. For large values of the
nonminimal coupling $\xi \gtrsim 1000$, it is possible for the Higgs condensate
to transfer the entirety of its energy into gauge fields within one
oscillation. For smaller values of the nonminimal coupling gauge bosons decay
very quickly into fermions, thereby shutting off Bose enhancement. Estimates of

compartments that range over a variety of scales. However, it is challenging to
systematically detect these cross-scale structures. Most studies have therefore
designed methods for specific scales to study foremost topologically associated
domains (TADs) and A/B compartments. To go beyond this limitation, we tailor a
network community detection method that finds communities in compact fractal
globule polymer systems. Our method allows us to continuously scan through all

big role in TAD formation---are well correlated with community borders only at
one level of organization. (iii) TADs and A/B compartments are traditionally
treated as two weakly related 3D structures and detected with different
algorithms. With our method, we detect both by simply adjusting the resolution

continuous spectrum 3D communities, rather than seeing them as different

events based on our newly developed database, and summarize the main findings
as follows. (1) The occurrence of small-scale flux ropes has strong solar cycle
dependency with a rate of a few hundreds per month on average. (2) The
small-scale magnetic flux ropes in the ecliptic plane tend to align along the
Parker spiral. (3) In low speed ($<$ 400 km/s) solar wind, the flux ropes tend
to have lower proton temperature and higher proton number density, while in
high speed ($\ge$ 400 km/s) solar wind, they tend to have higher proton
temperature and lower proton number density. (4) Both the duration and scale
size distributions of the small-scale magnetic flux ropes obey a power law. (5)
The waiting time distribution of small-scale magnetic flux ropes can be fitted
by an exponential function (for shorter waiting times) and a power law function
(for longer waiting times). (6) The wall-to-wall time distribution obeys double
power laws with the break point at 60 minutes (corresponding to the correlation
length). (7) The small-scale magnetic flux ropes tend to accumulate near the
heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The entire database is available at

the energy serves as a control parameter. We find periodic 'pendulum' and

a rather marked transition to chaos at $E_c \approx 4$, followed by a gradual
return to regularity as $E \to \infty$. We find four signatures of this
transition: (a) the fraction of the area of Poincar\'e surfaces occupied by
chaotic sections rises sharply at $E_c$, (b) discrete symmetries are
spontaneously broken at $E_c$, (c) $E=4$ is an accumulation point of stable to
unstable transitions in pendulum solutions and (d) the Jacobi-Maupertuis

parameter have found wide applications including signal detection, global
testing, inferences of error variance and fraction of variance explained.
Classical theory based on ordinary least squares estimator works perfectly in
the low-dimensional regime, but fails when the parameter dimension $p_n$ grows
proportionally to the sample size $n$. In some cases, its performance is not
satisfactory even when $n\ge 5p_n$.
  The main contribution of this paper is to develop {\em dimension-adaptive}
inferences for quadratic functionals when $\lim_{n\to \infty}
p_n/n=\tau\in[0,1)$. We propose a bias-and-variance-corrected test statistic
and demonstrate that its theoretical validity (such as consistency and
asymptotic normality) is adaptive to both low dimension with $\tau = 0$ and
moderate dimension with $\tau \in(0, 1)$. Our general theory holds, in
particular, without Gaussian design/error or structural parameter assumption,
and applies to a broad class of quadratic functionals covering all
aforementioned applications. As a by-product, we find that the classical
fixed-dimensional results continue to hold {\em if and only if} the
signal-to-noise ratio is large enough, say when $p_n$ diverges but slower than
$n$. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of
the proposed methodology even when $p_n\ge 0.9n$ in some extreme cases. The
mathematical arguments are based on the random matrix theory and
leave-one-observation-out method.

with a plane-wave discretization of Kohn-Sham equations. A priori estimates of
plane-wave convergence for periodic Kohn-Sham calculations with
pseudopotentials have been proved , however in most computations in practice,
plane-wave cut-offs are not tight enough to target the desired accuracy. It is
often advocated that the real quantity of interest is not the value of the
energy but of energy differences for different configurations. The computed
energy difference is believed to be much more accurate because of
`discretization error cancellation', since the sources of numerical errors are
essentially the same for different configurations. For periodic linear
Hamiltonians with Coulomb potentials, error cancellation can be explained by
the universality of the Kato cusp condition. Using weighted Sobolev spaces,
Taylor-type expansions of the eigenfunctions are available yielding a precise
characterization of this singularity. This then gives an explicit formula of
the first order term of the decay of the Fourier coefficients of the
eigenfunctions. It enables one to prove that errors on eigenvalue differences
are reduced but converge at the same rate as the error on the eigenvalue.

perovskite solar cells, however, they can induce additional non-radiative
recombination pathways which limit the open circuit voltage (V_OC) of the cell.
In order to realize the full thermodynamic potential of the perovskite
absorber, both the electron and hole transport layer (ETL/HTL) need to be as
selective as possible. By measuring the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) of
perovskite/CTL heterojunctions, we quantify the non-radiative interfacial
recombination current for a wide range of commonly used CTLs, including various
hole-transporting polymers, spiro-OMeTAD, metal oxides and fullerenes. We find
that all studied CTLs limit the V_OC by inducing an additional non-radiative
recombination current that is significantly larger than the loss in the neat
perovskite and that the least-selective interface sets the upper limit for the
V_OC of the device. The results also show that the V_OC equals the internal
QFLS in the absorber layer of (pin, nip) cells with selective CTLs and power
conversion efficiencies of up to 21.4%. However, in case of less selective
CTLs, the V_OC is substantially lower than the QFLS which indicates additional
losses at the contacts and/or interfaces. The findings are corroborated by
rigorous device simulations which outline several important considerations to
maximize the V_OC. This work shows that the real challenge to supress
non-radiative recombination losses in perovskite cells on their way to the
radiative limit lies in the suppression of carrier recombination at the
perovskite/CTL interfaces.

asymptotic form of the Virasoro conformal blocks in the limit $z \to 1$, which
was unknown until now. In this study, we computed it in general by studying the
pole structure of the {\it fusion matrix} (or the crossing kernel). Applying
this result to the light cone bootstrap, we obtained the universal total twist
(or equivalently, the universal binding energy) of two particles at a large
angular momentum. In particular, we found that the total twist is saturated by
the value $\frac{c-1}{12}$ if the total Liouville momentum exceeds beyond the
{\it BTZ threshold}. This might be interpreted as a black hole formation in
AdS${}_3$. As another application of our light cone singularity, we studied the
dynamics of entanglement after a global quench and found a Renyi phase
transition as the replica number was varied. We also investigated the dynamics
of the 2nd Renyi entropy after a local quench. We also provide a universal form

PAH luminosity underestimates SFR for galaxies with strong UV emission. A
bolometric extinction correction to far-ultraviolet luminosity yields SFR
within 0.2 dex of the total SFR estimate, but extinction corrections based on
UV spectral slope or nuclear Balmer decrement give SFRs that may differ from
the total SFR by up to 2 dex. However, for the minority of galaxies with UV
luminosity ${>}5\times10^9$ L$_{\odot}$ or with implied far-UV extinction <1
mag, the UV spectral slope gives extinction corrections with 0.22~dex
uncertainty.

at the inner boundary (18 solar radii, Rs) used in our global, 3D MHD model
(G3DMHD) or other equivalent ones. The model takes solar magnetic field maps at
2.5 Rs (which is based on the Potential Field Source Surface, PFSS model) and
interpolates the solar wind plasma and field out to 18 Rs using the algorithm
of Wang and Sheeley [1990a]. A formula V_{18Rs} = V1 + V2 fs^{\alpha} is used
to calculate the solar wind speed at 18 Rs, where V1 is in a range of 150-350
km/s, V2 is in the range of 250-500 km/s, and fs is an expansion factor, which
was derived from the Wang and Sheeley (WS) algorithm at 2.5 Rs. To estimate the
solar wind density and temperature at 18 Rs, we assume an incompressible solar
wind and a constant total pressure. The three free parameters are obtained by
adjusting simulation results to match in-situ observations (Wind) for more than
54 combination of V1, V2 and {\alpha} during a quiet solar wind interval,
CR2082. We found V18Rs = (150 +/- 50) + (500 +/- 100) fs^-0.4 km/s performs
reasonably well in predicting solar wind parameters at 1 AU not just for CR
2082 but other quiet solar period. Comparing results from the present study
with those from WSA [Arge et al. 2000; 2004] we conclude that i) Results of
using V_{18Rs} with the full rotation data (FR) as input to drive G3DMHD model
is better than the results of WSA using FR, or daily updated. ii) When using a
modified daily updated 4-day-advanced solar wind speed predictions WSA performs
slightly better than our G3DMHD. iii) When using V_{18Rs} as input, G3DMHD
model performs much better than the WSA formula. We argue the necessity of the

incomplete information of MG parametric models; while at the lower level, each
MG provides power-flow-constrained optimal response to price signals. The
function approximation scheme is then used within an adaptive RL framework to
optimize the price signal as the system load and solar generation change over

fastest-path computations between two points in a road network modeled as a

support this, very efficient computation of these paths in very large road
networks is critical. Fastest paths may be computed as minimal-cost paths in a
weighted directed graph, but traditional minimal-cost path algorithms based on
variants of the classic Dijkstra algorithm do not scale well, as in the worst
case they may traverse the entire graph. A common improvement, which can
dramatically reduce the number of traversed graph vertices, is the A*

introduce a simple, but very effective, heuristic function based on a small
number of values assigned to each graph vertex. The values are based on graph
separators and computed efficiently in a preprocessing stage. We present
experimental results demonstrating that our heuristic provides estimates of the
minimal cost which are superior to those of other heuristics. Our experiments

computational overhead of deep network inference, in which the output of a
teacher model is used to train a smaller, faster student model. Hint training
(i.e., FitNets) extends KD by regressing a student model's intermediate
representation to a teacher model's intermediate representation. In this work,
we introduce bLock-wise Intermediate representation Training (LIT), a novel
model compression technique that extends the use of intermediate
representations in deep network compression, outperforming KD and hint
training. LIT has two key ideas: 1) LIT trains a student of the same width (but
shallower depth) as the teacher by directly comparing the intermediate
representations, and 2) LIT uses the intermediate representation from the
previous block in the teacher model as an input to the current student block
during training, avoiding unstable intermediate representations in the student
network. We show that LIT provides substantial reductions in network depth
without loss in accuracy -- for example, LIT can compress a ResNeXt-110 to a
ResNeXt-20 (5.5x) on CIFAR10 and a VDCNN-29 to a VDCNN-9 (3.2x) on Amazon
Reviews without loss in accuracy, outperforming KD and hint training in network
size for a given accuracy. We also show that applying LIT to identical
student/teacher architectures increases the accuracy of the student model above
the teacher model, outperforming the recently-proposed Born Again Networks
procedure on ResNet, ResNeXt, and VDCNN. Finally, we show that LIT can
effectively compress GAN generators, which are not supported in the KD
framework because GANs output pixels as opposed to probabilities.

pipe flow regimes from laminar to the fully rough turbulent. It includes
laminar, unstable sharp jump from laminar to turbulent, and all types of the
turbulent regimes: smooth turbulent regime, partial non-fully developed
turbulent and fully developed rough turbulent regime. The formula follows the
inflectional form of curves as suggested in Nikuradse's experiment rather than
monotonic shape proposed by Colebrook and White. The composition of the
proposed unified formula consists of switching functions and of the
interchangeable formulas for laminar, smooth turbulent and fully rough
turbulent flow. The proposed switching functions provide a smooth and a
computationally cheap transition among hydraulic regimes. Thus, the here
presented formulation represents a coherent hydraulic model suitable for
engineering use. The model is compared to existing literature models, and shows
smooth and computationally cheap transitions among hydraulic regimes.

is the global optimum. For these problems, various heuristic optimization
methods have been proposed. Comparing the results of these solvers requires the
definition of suitable metrics. In the electrical energy systems literature,
simple metrics such as best value obtained, the mean value, the median or the
standard deviation of the solutions are still used. However, the comparisons
carried out with these metrics are rather weak, and on these bases a somehow
uncontrolled proliferation of heuristic solvers is taking place. This paper
addresses the overall issue of understanding the reasons of this proliferation,
showing a conceptual scheme that indicates how the assessment of the best
solver may result in the unlimited formulation of new solvers. Moreover, this
paper shows how the use of more refined metrics defined to compare the
optimization result, associated with the definition of appropriate benchmarks,
may make the comparisons among the solvers more robust. The proposed metrics
are based on the concept of first-order stochastic dominance and are defined
for the cases in which: (i) the globally optimal solution can be found (for
testing purposes); and (ii) the number of possible solutions is so large that
practically it cannot be guaranteed that the global optimum has been found.
Illustrative examples are provided for a typical problem in the electrical
energy systems area-distribution network reconfiguration. The conceptual
results obtained are generally valid to compare the results of other
optimization problems.

surfaces and show its utility in a variety of geometric deep learning
applications. Key to our construction is the notion of directional functions
defined on the surface, which extend the classic real-valued signals and which
can be naturally convolved with with real-valued template functions. As a
result, rather than trying to fix a canonical orientation or only keeping the
maximal response across all alignments of a 2D template at every point of the
surface, as done in previous works, we show how information across all
rotations can be kept across different layers of the neural network. Our
construction, which we call multi-directional geodesic convolution, or
directional convolution for short, allows, in particular, to propagate and
relate directional information across layers and thus different regions on the
shape. We first define directional convolution in the continuous setting, prove
its key properties and then show how it can be implemented in practice, for
shapes represented as triangle meshes. We evaluate directional convolution in a
wide variety of learning scenarios ranging from classification of signals on
surfaces, to shape segmentation and shape matching, where we show a significant
improvement over several baselines.

applications to the retraction theory in gravitational physics and showed that
it can be very useful in providing proofs and explaining the topological bases.
In the current work, we investigate the role of the retraction theory in the

restriction on the formation of singularities. Although we present a toy model
using a 5D cosmological metric as an example, the current study applies for any
collapsing system under the influence of gravity such as a massive star or the
whole universe. After showing that the cosmological space-time $M$ can be
retracted into lower dimensional circles $S_i \subset M $, we prove the
existence of a homotopy between this retraction and the identity map which
defines a deformation retract on $M$. Since a circle doesn't deformation
retract onto a point but it does retract to a point, the defined deformation
retract stops any circle $S_i$ from retracting into a point which means no
singularity is formed. The paper underlines the role of algebraic topology in
the mathematical study of space-time singularities and represents a new
application of the retraction theory in mathematical physics.
