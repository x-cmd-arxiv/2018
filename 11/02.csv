we recommend the proposed score-matching representatives (SMR), which may
improve the accuracy of estimators significantly by matching the score function

structured. In this article, we theoretically demonstrate the possibility of
realizing \emph{unidirectional and diffractionless surface-plasmon-polariton

Based on a rigorous Green function approach, we provide a comprehensive and
systematic analysis of all the available physical mechanisms that may bestow
the system with directionality, both in the sense of one-way excitation of
surface waves, and in the sense of directive diffractionless propagation along
the surface. The considered mechanisms include (i) the effect of strong and
weak forms of nonreciprocity, (ii) the elliptic-like or hyperbolic-like
topology of the modal dispersion surfaces, and (iii) the source polarization
state, with the associated possibility of chiral surface-wave excitation
governed by angular-momentum matching. We find that three-dimensional
gyrotropic plasmonic platforms support a previously-unnoticed wave-propagation
regime that exhibit several of these physical mechanisms simultaneously,

physics analyses is produced by beamstrahlung radiation from the electron and
positron bunches traversing the high field of the opposite beam and converting
to hadrons. The timing selections are a powerful tool to discriminate signal
from background events at CLIC. For each CLIC stage, three sets of selections,
Loose, Selected, and Tight, are defined to allow the analysis of different
signal topologies. The selections are defined depending on the particle type
and the reconstructed polar angle of each particle flow object reconstructed
using the particle flow analysis. As a first step, the performance of the
timing selections currently defined for the CLIC 380 GeV energy stage are
evaluated using a $t\overline{t}$ sample decaying mainly into light quarks as
signal and $\gamma\gamma\to$hadron events as background. As a result, after
applying the selections the level of background is significantly reduced, down
to few GeV, while the shift of the signal peak to lower energy is kept within a
few percent. The cuts in the Loose selection are then relaxed to search for
possible improvements: in one of the options considered, the signal component
is partially recovered but also the background energy mean remains unchanged
with respect to not applying any cuts. In conclusion, no change is foreseen on

to the maximum UAV flying speed constraint. Different from previous works that
only provided heuristic and locally optimal solutions, this paper is the first
work to present the globally optimal 1D UAV trajectory solution to the
considered min-energy maximization problem. Towards this end, we first show
that for any given speed-constrained UAV trajectory, we can always construct a
maximum-speed trajectory and a speed-free trajectory, such that their
combination can achieve the same received energy at all these ground nodes.
Next, we transform the original UAV-speed-constrained trajectory optimization
problem into an equivalent UAV-speed-free problem, which is then optimally
solved via the Lagrange dual method. The obtained optimal 1D UAV trajectory
solution follows the so-called successive hover-and-fly (SHF) structure, i.e.,
the UAV successively hovers at a finite number of hovering points each for an
optimized hovering duration, and flies among these hovering points at the
maximum speed. Numerical results show that our proposed optimal solution

advantage of the abundance of video data labeled for tracking, which contains
natural repetitions suitable for training a counting model. Such data enables
us to train the GMN. Third, to customize the GMN to different user

of the trained parameters. This is a form of few-shot learning, which is
practical for domains where labels are limited due to requiring expert
knowledge (e.g. microbiology). We demonstrate the flexibility of our method on

that the residuals resulting in such cases can be efficiently described with

how these additional terms can be constructed self-consistently from the

effect of small fields along the crystallographic $c$ axis, we resolve a shift
in the cusp position moving to lower temperatures. For in-plane fields the cusp
rapidly disappears and a broad shoulder that shifts to higher temperatures. We
are able to reproduce our measured calorimetry data quantitatively by
Monte-Carlo simulations of an anisotropic easy-plane 2D Heisenberg model. We
can thus show that (i) the spins are preferably in plane, (ii) the cusp in
specific heat is due to a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, and
(iii) the high-temperature hump in higher fields marks a crossover from a
paramagnetically disordered to an ordered state. The extracted phase and

nonparametric regression with the parsimony of regression models, and has been
widely used as a popular tool in multivariate nonparametric regression to
alleviate the ""curse of dimensionality"". A natural question raised in practice
is the choice of structure in the nonparametric part, that is, whether the
continuous covariates enter into the model in linear or nonparametric form. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for simultaneous sparse model
identification and learning for ultra-high-dimensional APLMs where both the
linear and nonparametric components are possibly larger than the sample size.
We propose a fast and efficient two-stage procedure. In the first stage, we
decompose the nonparametric functions into a linear part and a nonlinear part.
The nonlinear functions are approximated by constant spline bases, and a triple
penalization procedure is proposed to select nonzero components using adaptive
group LASSO. In the second stage, we refit data with selected covariates using
higher order polynomial splines, and apply spline-backfitted local-linear
smoothing to obtain asymptotic normality for the estimators. The procedure is
shown to be consistent for model structure identification. It can identify
zero, linear, and nonlinear components correctly and efficiently. Inference can
be made on both linear coefficients and nonparametric functions. We conduct
simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the method and apply the
proposed method to a dataset on the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) of maize
genotypes for illustration.

comparing wave patterns producible by the classical LWR model versus this

analysis is carried out by construction of viscous waves and Riemann solvers of
the model. Examples of solutions for initial data corresponding to some real

qualitatively agree with experimental observations and intuition. These result
shows that the model not only keeps the successful part of the LWR model, but
also demonstrates many wave patterns observed real world traffic that LWR fails
to exhibit, such as stop-and-go waves and many other traffic patterns. A
mechanism for formation and decay of stop-and-go patterns and traffic jams is
revealed. Furthermore, acceleration shocks in congested zone are predicted,

increasing energy. The predictions from a previously studied model are shown to
be in good agreement with the data and thus allow us to draw rather firm
conclusions about the structure of the near-forward nuclear amplitude. We point
out that due to a zero in the real part of the nuclear amplitude occurring at a
very small momentum transfer--that can migrate into the Coulomb-nuclear
interference (CNI) region at higher energies--much care is needed in extracting
the numerical value of $\rho$ for such energies. Thus, the true value of $\rho$

the average loss. When the actual metric of interest is 0-1 loss, it is common
to minimize the average surrogate loss for some well-behaved (e.g. convex)
surrogate. Recently, several other aggregate losses such as the maximal loss
and average top-$k$ loss were proposed as alternative objectives to address
shortcomings of the average loss. However, we identify common classification
settings, e.g. the data is imbalanced, has too many easy or ambiguous examples,
etc., when average, maximal and average top-$k$ all suffer from suboptimal
decision boundaries, even on an infinitely large training set. To address this
problem, we propose a new classification objective called the close-$k$
aggregate loss, where we adaptively minimize the loss for points close to the
decision boundary. We provide theoretical guarantees for the 0-1 accuracy when
we optimize close-$k$ aggregate loss. We also conduct systematic experiments
across the PMLB and OpenML benchmark datasets. Close-$k$ achieves significant
gains in 0-1 test accuracy, improvements of $\geq 2$% and $p<0.05$, in over 25%
of the datasets compared to average, maximal and average top-$k$. In contrast,
the previous aggregate losses outperformed close-$k$ in less than 2% of the
datasets.

The
speed of Type I migration is proportional to the mass of a protoplanet, while
the final decade of growth of a pebble-accreting planetary core takes place at
a rate that scales with the mass to the two-thirds power. This results in
planetary growth tracks (i.e., the evolution of a protoplanet's mass versus its
distance from the star) that become increasingly horizontal
(migration-dominated) with rising mass of the protoplanet. It has been shown
recently that the migration torque on a protoplanet is reduced proportional to
the relative height of the gas gap carved by the growing planet. Here we show
from 1-D simulations of planet-disc interaction that the mass at which a planet
carves a 50% gap is approximately 2.3 times the pebble isolation mass. Our
measurements of the pebble isolation mass from 1-D simulations match published
3-D results relatively well, except at very low viscosities where the 3-D
pebble isolation mass is significantly higher, possibly due to gap edge
instabilities not captured in 1-D. The pebble isolation mass demarks the
transition from pebble accretion to gas accretion. Gas accretion to form
gas-giant planets therefore takes place over a few astronomical units of
migration after reaching first the pebble isolation mass and, shortly after,
the 50% gap mass. Our results demonstrate how planetary growth can outperform
migration, both during core accretion and during gas accretion, even when the
Stokes number of the pebbles is small, St~0.01, and the pebble-to-gas flux
ratio in the protoplanetary disc is in the nominal range of 0.01-0.02. We find
that planetary growth is very rapid in the first million years of the
protoplanetary disc and that the probability for forming gas-giant planets
increases with the initial size of the protoplanetary disc and with decreasing
turbulent diffusion.

In particular, we highlight the importance of codimension: for low-dimensional
data manifolds embedded in high-dimensional space there are many directions off
the manifold in which to construct adversarial examples. Adversarial examples
are a natural consequence of learning a decision boundary that classifies the
low-dimensional data manifold well, but classifies points near the manifold
incorrectly. Using our geometric framework we prove (1) a tradeoff between

The method relies on a Hamiltonian picture, where the theory is quantized on
$S^{d-1}$ and states evolve in time by means of a time-dependent Hamiltonian.
Crucially, the Hilbert space on $S^{d-1}$ is truncated to a finite set of
states below a cutoff. Throughout this work we focus on the $\phi^2$ and
$i\phi^3$ flows in three dimensions. In the first part of this paper we analyze
the cutoff-dependence of various observables, computing both divergent and
RG-improvement counterterms to be added to the action. Next we present
nonperturbative results for the massive scalar on $S^3$, finding good agreement
in the strong-coupling regime between numerical data and the $F$-coefficient of
the free scalar CFT. We also check that the renormalized $i \phi^3$ theory on
$S^3$ is nonperturbatively UV-finite. The scheme in question breaks the
$\mathrm{SO}(d+1)$ spacetime symmetry group of $S^d$ down to $\mathrm{SO}(d)$,

not within reach of current experiments, the proposed method is a unique way to

research in this direction a novel `fact-based' visual question answering
(FVQA) task has been introduced recently along with a large set of curated
facts which link two entities, i.e., two possible answers, via a relation.
Given a question-image pair, deep network techniques have been employed to
successively reduce the large set of facts until one of the two entities of the
final remaining fact is predicted as the answer. We observe that a successive
process which considers one fact at a time to form a local decision is
sub-optimal. Instead, we develop an entity graph and use a graph convolutional
network to `reason' about the correct answer by jointly considering all
entities. We show on the challenging FVQA dataset that this leads to an
improvement in accuracy of around 7% compared to the state of the art.

bound. Although this trend is observed at all scales, from massive clouds down
to star-forming cores, theories do not predict it. In this work we show how,
starting from virialized clumps, an observational bias is introduced in the
specific case where the kinetic and the gravitational energies are estimated in
different volumes within clumps and how it can contribute to the spurious
$\alpha_{vir}-M_{c}$ anti-correlation in these data. As a result, the observed
effective virial parameter $\tilde{\alpha}_{eff}<\alpha_{vir}$, and in some
circumstances it might not be representative of the virial state of the
observed clumps.

motivated, firstly, by the gradually accumulating successes in reformulating

flux variations on timescales shorter than the event-horizon scales (flux
doubling timescale less than 5 minutes). Thanks to the recent advancement in
the imaging capabilities of high-resolution radio interferometry (millimeter
very long baseline interferometry, mm-VLBI), one can probe the scales down to
less than 10 gravitational radii in TeVRad, making it possible not only to test
jet launching models but also to pinpoint the high-energy emission sites and to
unravel the emission mechanisms. This review provides an overview of the
high-energy observations of TeVRad with a focus on the emitting sites and

of increasing the number of CO ligands attached to a cobalt adatom on

experimentally (P. Wahl et al, Phy. Rev. Lett. 95, 166601 (2005)), by solving
an Anderson impurity model parametrized by density functional theory (DFT++).
Our results suggest that the orbital responsible for the Kondo effect is
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ for the tetracarbonyl, and its combination with $d_{z^2}$ for the
dicarbonyl. The molecular structures depend considerably on the approximate
exchange--correlation functional, which may be related to the known difficulty
of describing CO binding to metal surfaces. These structural variations
strongly affect the Kondo properties, which is not only a concern for
predictive studies, but also of interest for detecting mechanical deformations
and for understanding the effect of tip--adsorbate interactions in the scanning
tunneling microscope. Still, by constraining the tetracarbonyl to $C_{4v}$
symmetry, as suggested by experimental data, we find structures compatible with
the experimental trend for $T_K$ (employing BLYP-D3+U). This is not possible
for the tricarbonyl despite the range of computational parameters scanned. For
the tetra- and dicarbonyl, the increased $T_K$ correlates with a larger
hybridization function at the Fermi level, which we trace back to an increased

during which the peak luminosity exceeds the quiescent pre-burst values by
factors from 2.5 to more than 40. Throughout these short time periods, they can

electromagnetic radiation through nonlinear interactions of continuous-wave
(CW) laser light. Using photonic-integration techniques, functional devices
with low noise, small size, low-power consumption, scalable fabrication, and
heterogeneous combinations of photonics and electronics can be realized. Kerr
solitons, which stably circulate in a Kerr microresonator, have emerged as a
source of coherent, ultrafast pulse trains and ultra-broadband
optical-frequency combs. Using the f-2f technique, Kerr combs support
carrier-envelope-offset phase stabilization for optical synthesis and
metrology. In this paper, we introduce a Kerr-microresonator optical clockwork
based on optical-frequency division (OFD), which is a powerful technique to
transfer the fractional-frequency stability of an optical clock to a lower
frequency electronic clock signal. The clockwork presented here is based on a
silicon-nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) microresonator that supports an optical-frequency
comb composed of soliton pulses at 1 THz repetition rate. By electro-optic
phase modulation of the entire Si$_3$N$_4$ comb, we arbitrarily generate
additional CW modes between the Si$_3$N$_4$ comb modes; operationally, this
reduces the pulse train repetition frequency and can be used to implement OFD
to the microwave domain. Our experiments characterize the residual frequency
noise of this Kerr-microresonator clockwork to one part in $10^{17}$, which
opens the possibility of using Kerr combs with high performance optical clocks.
In addition, the photonic integration and 1 THz resolution of the Si$_3$N$_4$
frequency comb makes it appealing for broadband, low-resolution liquid-phase
absorption spectroscopy, which we demonstrate with near infrared measurements
of water, lipids, and organic solvents.

comparing known infected to new host log streams for attack detection and

Human-centered diagnosis is typically error-prone and unreliable resulting in a
recent surge of interest to automatize this process using convolutional neural

is particularly harmful for tumor classification, as the relation between the
tumor and its surrounding tissue is a critical indicator of the tumor's type.

this shortcoming. CapsNets are, however, highly sensitive to the miscellaneous

equip CapsNet with access to the tumor surrounding tissues, without distracting
it from the main target. A modified CapsNet architecture is, therefore,
proposed for brain tumor classification, which takes the tumor coarse

an interesting deviation in a pair of observations among many possible pairs,

  We present VizRec, a framework for improving the performance of visual
recommendation systems by quantifying the statistical significance of
recommended visualizations. The proposed methodology allows to control the
probability of misleading visual recommendations using both classical
statistical testing procedures and a novel application of the Vapnik

to dictate the execution order of instructions. The Gamma paradigm is based on
a parallel multiset rewriting scheme. It provides a non-deterministic execution
model inspired by an abstract chemical machine metaphor, where operations are
formulated as reactions that occur freely among matching elements belonging to
the multiset. In this work, equivalence relations between the dynamic Dataflow

Dataflow to Gamma paradigm and vice versa are provided. It is shown that
vertices and edges of a dynamic Dataflow graph can correspond, respectively, to
reactions and multiset elements in the Gamma paradigm. Implementation aspects
of execution environments that could be mutually beneficial to both models are
also discussed. This work provides the scientific community with the
possibility of taking profit of both parallel programming models, contributing
with a versatility component to researchers and developers. Finally, it is
important to state that, to the best of our knowledge, the similarity relations

times at which all 4 bodies lie in the same plane. This result generalizes a
known result for collinear instants (""syzygies"") in the zero angular momentum
planar 3-body problem, and extends to the $d+1$ body problem in $d$-space. The
proof, for $d=3$, starts by identifying the center-of-mass zero configuration

the hypersurface of matrices with determinant zero. The proof hinges on
establishing a harmonic oscillator type ODE for $S$ along solutions. Bounds on
inter-body distances then yield an explicit lower bound $\omega$ for the
frequency of this oscillator, guaranteeing a degeneration within every time

covariance has not yet been established in quantum gravity and cosmology,
where, given the a priori absence of coordinates, it is necessary to replace
classical frames with dynamical quantum reference systems. As such, quantum
general covariance bears on the ability to consistently switch between the
descriptions of the same physics relative to arbitrary choices of quantum
reference system. Recently, a systematic approach for such switches has been
developed (arXiv:1809.00556, 1809.05093, 1810.04153). It links the descriptions
relative to different choices of quantum reference system, identified as the
correspondingly reduced quantum theories, via the reference-system-neutral
Dirac quantization, in analogy to coordinate changes on a manifold. In this
work, we apply this method to a simple cosmological model to demonstrate how to
consistently switch between different internal time choices in quantum
cosmology. We substantiate the argument that the conjunction of Dirac and
reduced quantized versions of the theory defines a complete relational quantum
theory that not only admits a quantum general covariance, but, we argue, also
suggests a new perspective on the 'wave function of the universe'. It assumes
the role of a perspective-neutral global state, without immediate physical
interpretation, that, however, encodes all the descriptions of the universe
relative to all possible choices of reference system at once and constitutes
the crucial link between these internal perspectives. While, for simplicity, we
use the Wheeler-DeWitt formulation, the method and arguments might be also
adaptable to loop quantum cosmology.

Vector Analysis to exploit underlying complementary information contained in
different molecular featurization methods, bringing us a step closer to
automated feature generation. Our approach takes an arbitrary number of
individual feature vectors and automatically generates a single, compact (low

prediction performance of regression models. At the same time our methodology
retains the possibility of interpreting the generated features to discover
relationships between molecular structures and properties. We demonstrate this
on the QM7b dataset for the prediction of several properties such as

razor-thin arcs, with a thickness of less than a milli-arcsecond, if observed

Such razor-thin arcs provide a unique window on the coarseness of the matter
distribution between source and observer. In this paper, we investigate to what
extent such razor-thin arcs can constrain the number density and mass function
of `free-floating' black holes, defined as black holes that do not, or no
longer, reside at the centre of a galaxy. These can be either primordial in
origin or arise as by-products of the evolution of super-massive black holes in
galactic nuclei. When sufficiently close to the line of sight, free-floating
black holes cause kink-like distortions in the arcs, which are detectable by
eye in the VLBI images as long as the black hole mass exceeds $\sim 1000$ Solar
masses. Using a crude estimate for the detectability of such distortions, we
analytically compute constraints on the matter density of free-floating black
holes resulting from null-detections of distortions along a realistic, fiducial
arc, and find them to be comparable to those from quasar milli-lensing. We also
use predictions from a large hydrodynamical simulation for the demographics of
free-floating black holes that are not primordial in origin, and show that
their predicted mass density is roughly four orders of magnitude below the
constraints achievable with a single razor-thin arc.

multiple droplet sizes in CRS patients using computational fluid dynamics
(CFD). Methods: Three-dimensional models of sinonasal cavities were constructed
from computed tomography (CT) scans of three subjects with CRS refractory to
medical therapy using imaging software. Assuming steady-state inspiratory
airflow at resting rate, CFD was used to simulate 1-120 {\mu}m sprayed droplet
deposition in the left and right sinuses and OMC with spray nozzle positioning
as in current nasal spray use instructions. Zero-velocity nebulization
simulations were performed for 1-30 {\mu}m droplet sizes, maximal sinus and OMC
deposition fractions (MSDF) were obtained, and sizes that achieved at least 50%
of MSDF were identified. Nebulized MSDF was compared to sprayed droplet
deposition. We also validated CFD framework through in vitro experiments.
Results: Among nebulized droplet sizes, 11-14 {\mu}m droplets achieved at least
50% of MSDF in all six sinonasal cavities. Five of six sinonasal cavities had
greater sinus and OMC deposition with nebulized droplets than with sprayed
droplets at optimal sizes. Conclusions: Nebulized droplets may target the
sinuses and OMC more effectively than sprayed particles at sizes achieving best
deposition. Further studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings.
Several commercial nasal nebulizers have average particle sizes outside the
optimal nebulized droplet size range found here, suggesting potential for
product enhancement.

of (non-collisional) discreteness effects. We integrate orbit ensembles in
fixed external potentials, estimating the entropy of the ensemble to analyze
the time evolution of the distribution function. We show that these estimates
capture the correct physical behavior expected from the 2nd Law of
Thermodynamics, without any spurious entropy production. For self-consistent
(i.e. stationary) samples, the entropy is conserved, while for
non-self-consistent samples, it increases within a few dynamical times up to a
maximum where it stabilizes (even in integrable potentials). Our results shed
light on the main ingredients for this fast collisionless relaxation. The
fundamental ingredient is the discreteness (finite $N$) of gravitational
systems in any potential. Additionally, in non-integrable potentials, the
presence of chaotic orbits accelerates the entropy production. Contrary to the
traditional violent relaxation scenario, our results indicate that a
time-dependent potential is not necessary for this fast relaxation. For the
first time, in connection with the Nyquist-Shannon theorem we determine the
$N$-dependence of this discreteness-driven relaxation, deriving a typical
relaxation time $T/\tau_{cr}\approx 0.1 N^{1/6}$, with slightly weaker
$N$-dependencies for non-integrable potentials with substantial fractions of
chaotic orbits. This timescale is much smaller than the collisional timescale
even for small-$N$ systems such as open clusters and represents an upper limit
for real collisionless $N$-body systems. Additionally, our results reinforce
the conclusion draw in Beraldo e Silva et al. (2017) that the Vlasov equation
does not provide an adequate kinetic description of the fast relaxation of
collapsing collisionless $N$-body systems.

energy technologies. To make PV more competitive with incumbent technologies,
higher power output densities are needed. One promising approach is to add
bifaciality to existing monofacial PV devices, allowing more output power from
the additional reflection of sunlight from the ground (albedo). For example,
bifaciality can be added to Silicon Heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell with
Interdigitated Back Contacts (IBC) by opening up the gaps between the back
metal contacts, but the optimum gap that maximizes power output is unknown. In
this paper we show that that the optimum gap that maximizes IBC SHJ bifacial
power output, where is the ratio of output power density to power loss due to
shadowing and Joule heating, The results are validated by self consistent
finite element device modeling. For a typical albedo factor of 0.3, an
optimized bifacial IBC SHJ cell will produce 17% more power output than
state-of-the-art monofacial IBC SHJ cells. The results encourage development of
bifacial IBC solar cells as a next generation PV technology.

hypothesized that MMT produces a differential level of change in the volume of

with the osteomeatal complex (OMC) influences clinical response to MMT. Study
Design: Retrospective study of 12 pre- and post-MMT sinus-CT scans from 6
subjects with CRS, of which three succeeded and three failed therapy. Methods:
Mimics was used to create 3D-models of the MNC and PS, and then analysis of the
models was performed. Results: Mean differences in the sinonasal volume were
7866.5+/-4339.9 mm3 and 17869.10+/-19472.70 mm3, amongst the failures and
successes, respectively. There is wide variability in the contribution of PS
and MNC airspace volume change to the overall change in the sinonasal volume.
In two subjects, the direction of volume change in the MNC and PS diverged with
respect to the overall change in volume. Line-of-sight analysis demonstrated
that successful responders to MMT had more patent MNC with direct access to the
OMC. Conclusions: There is a differential contribution to sinonasal, airspace
volume change after MMT, when comparing the MNC and PS. Response to MMT may not
be solely attributable to PS change and may include a function of MNC change.
Line-of-sight models suggest that direct access to the OMC may impact response
to MMT.

analogues have been studied for many decades in the search for efficient
network topologies. Recently such questions have received much attention in the
setting of mixed graphs, i.e. networks that admit both undirected \emph{edges}
and directed \emph{arcs}. The degree/diameter problem for mixed graphs asks for
the largest possible order of a network with diameter $k$, maximum undirected
degree $\leq r$ and maximum directed out-degree $\leq z$. It is also of
interest to find smallest possible $k$-geodetic mixed graphs with minimum
undirected degree $\geq r$ and minimum directed out-degree $\geq z$. A simple
counting argument reveals the existence of a natural bound, the \emph{Moore
bound}, on the order of such graphs; a graph that meets this limit is a
\emph{mixed Moore graph}. Mixed Moore graphs can exist only for $k = 2$ and
even in this case it is known that they are extremely rare. It is therefore of
interest to search for graphs with order one away from the Moore bound. Such
graphs must be out-regular; a much more difficult question is whether they must
be totally regular. For $k = 2$, we answer this question in the affirmative,
thereby resolving an open problem stated in a recent paper of L\'opez and
Miret. We also present partial results for larger $k$. We finally put these
results to practical use by proving the uniqueness of a 2-geodetic mixed graph
with order exceeding the Moore bound by one.

(1) Such artifacts can be simulated directly using simple image processing
operations on a image to make it as negative example. Since training a DeepFake

our method saves a plenty of time and resources in training data collection;

theoretical studies have analyzed the implicit regularization effect of
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on simple machine learning models with
certain assumptions. However, how it behaves practically in state-of-the-art

the role of SGD implicit regularization in deep learning systems. We show pure
SGD tends to converge to minimas that have better generalization performances
in multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This phenomenon coexists
with dropout, an explicit regularizer. In addition, neural network's finite
learning capability does not impact the intrinsic nature of SGD's implicit
regularization effect. Specifically, under limited training samples or with
certain corrupted labels, the implicit regularization effect remains strong. We
further analyze the stability by varying the weight initialization range. We
corroborate these experimental findings with a decision boundary visualization

a deepened understanding on how implicit regularization affects the deep

a tachocline at the base, where the differential rotation of the CZ transitions
to solid-body rotation in the radiative zone, and a 35-Mm-thick near-surface
shear layer (NSSL) at the top, where the rotation rate slows by about 5% with
increasing radius. Though asteroseismology cannot probe the differential
rotation of distant stars to the same level of detail that helioseismology can
achieve for the Sun, it is possible that many cool stars with outer convective
envelopes possess similar differential rotation characteristics, including both
a tachocline and a NSSL. Here we present the results of 3D global hydrodynamic

equivalent to the (pre-eminent paradigm) of the Gate model but less
error-prone, so it is ideally suitable to practically tackle a large number of
important applications. AQC remains, however, poorly understood theoretically
and its mathematical underpinnings are yet to be satisfactorily identified.
Through Morse theory, we bring a novel perspective that we expect will open the
door for using such mathematics in the realm of quantum computations, providing
a secure foundation for AQC. Here we show that the singular homology of a
certain cobordism, which we construct from the given Hamiltonian, defines the
adiabatic evolution. Our result is based on E. Witten's construction for Morse
homology that was derived in the very different context of supersymmetric
quantum mechanics. We investigate how such topological description, in
conjunction with Gau\ss-Bonnet theorem and curvature based reformulation of
Morse lemma, can be an obstruction to any computational advantage in AQC. We
also explore Conley theory, for the sake of completeness, in advance of any
known practical Hamiltonian of interest. We conclude with the instructive case
of the ferromagnetic $p-$spin where we show that changing its first order
quantum transition (QPT) into a second order QPT, by adding non-stoquastic
couplings, amounts to homotopically deform the initial surface accompanied with
birth of pairs of critical points. Their number reaches its maximum when the
system is fully non-stoquastic. In parallel, the total Gaussian curvature gets
redistributed (by the Gau\ss--Bonnet theorem) around the new neighbouring
critical points, which weakens the severity of the QPT.

Saturn's outer A ring (Tiscareno et al. 2010, Seiler et al. 2017, Spahn et al.
2018) raises the question, how the propeller responds to the wandering of the
central embedded moonlet. Here, we study numerically how the induced propeller
is changing for a librating moonlet. It turns out, that the libration of the
moonlet induces an asymmetry in the structural imprint of the propeller, where
the asymmetry is depending on the moonlet's libration period and amplitude.
Further, we study the dependence of the asymmetry on the libration period and
amplitude for a moonlet with 400 m Hill radius, which is located in the outer A
ring. In this way, we are able to apply our findings to the largest found
propeller structures -- such as Bl\'eriot -- which are expected to be of
similar size. For Bl\'eriot, we can conclude that, supposed the moonlet is
librating with the largest observed period of 11.1 years and an azimuthal
amplitude of about 1845 km (Seiler et al. 2017, Spahn et al. 2018), a small
assymmetry should be measurable but depends on the moonlet's libration phase at
the observation time. The excess motions of the other giant propellers -- such
as Santos Dumont and Earhart -- have similar amplitudes as Bl\'eriot and thus
might allow the observation of larger asymmetries due to their smaller
azimuthal extent. This would permit to scan the whole gap structure for
asymmetries.
  Although the librational model of the moonlet is a simplification, our
results are a first step towards the development of a consistent model for the
description of the formation of asymmetric propellers caused by a freely moving
moonlet.

neuron system model with multi-covariates and unknown inputs. Previous research
of neuron activity analysis is mainly limited with effects from the spiking
history of target neuron and the interaction with other neurons in the system
while ignoring the influence of unknown stimuli. We propose to use unknown
unknowns, which describes the effect of unknown stimuli, undetected neuron
activities and all other hidden sources of error. The maximum likelihood
estimation with the fixed-point iteration method is implemented. The
fixed-point iterations converge fast, and the proposed methods can be
efficiently parallelized and offer computational advantage especially when the
input spiking trains are over long time-horizon. The developed framework
provides an intuition into the meaning of having extra degrees-of-freedom in
the data to support the need for unknowns. The proposed algorithm is applied to
simulated spike trains and on real-world experimental data of mouse
somatosensory, mouse retina and cat retina. The model shows a successful
increasing of system likelihood with respect to the conditional intensity
function, and it also reveals the convergence with iterations. Results suggest
that the neural connection model with unknown unknowns can efficiently estimate
the statistical properties of the process by increasing the network likelihood.

  and related problems",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper concerns proving almost tight (super-polynomial) running times,
for achieving desired approximation ratios for various problems. To illustrate,
the question we study, let us consider the Set-Cover problem with n elements
and m sets. Now we specify our goal to approximate Set-Cover to a factor of
(1-d)ln n, for a given parameter 0<d<1. What is the best possible running time
for achieving such approximation? This question was answered implicitly in the
work of Moshkovitz [Theory of Computing, 2015]: Assuming both the Projection
Games Conjecture (PGC) and the Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH), any ((1-d) ln
n)-approximation algorithm for Set-Cover must run in time >= 2^{n^{c d}}, for
some constant 0<d<1.
  We study the questions along this line. First, we show that under ETH and PGC
any ((1-d) \ln n)-approximation for Set-Cover requires 2^{n^{d}}-time. This
(almost) matches the running time of 2^{O(n^d)} for approximating Set-Cover to
a factor (1-d) ln n by Cygan et al. [IPL, 2009]. Our result is tight up to the
constant multiplying the n^{d} terms in the exponent. This lower bound applies
to all of its generalizations, e.g., Group Steiner Tree (GST), Directed Steiner
(DST), Covering Steiner Tree (CST), Connected Polymatroid (CP). We also show
that in almost exponential time, these problems reduce to Set-Cover: We show
(1-d)ln n approximation algorithms for all these problems that run in time
2^{n^{d \log n } poly(m).
  We also study log^{2-d}n approximation for GST. Chekuri-Pal [FOCS, 2005]
showed that GST admits (log^{2-d}n)-approximation in time
exp(2^{log^{d+o(1)}n}), for any 0 < d < 1. We show the lower bound of GST: any
(log^{2-d}n)-approximation for GST must run in time >=
exp((1+o(1)){log^{d-c}n}), for any c>0, unless the ETH is false. Our result
follows by analyzing the work of Halperin and Krauthgamer [STOC, 2003]. The
same lower and upper bounds hold for CST.

diminished by a gradient suppressing factor, designed to attenuate the energy

Preliminary work was performed by Babbush et al. (2012) to fold a small peptide

providing improved Ising-type Hamiltonian encodings for the problem of finding
the lowest energy conformation of a lattice protein. We demonstrate a decrease
in quantum circuit complexity from quadratic to quasilinear in certain cases.
Additionally, we generalize to three spatial dimensions in order to obtain
results with higher correlation to the actual atomistic 3D structure of the

instances into smaller subproblems that can be directly solved with the current
D-Wave 2000Q architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this work sets a new

second order Taylor polynomial approximation of the microscopic Eulerian drag
coefficient. Theoretical computations of the expression are performed at low
Reynolds numbers based on an available microscopic drag model. It shows that
four sub-grid quantities, i.e., the gas drift velocity, the solid drift
velocity, the scalar variance of solid volume fraction and a third-order
moment, defined as the covariance of squared solid volume fraction and the slip
velocity, are significant for an accurate estimation of the filtered drag force
at low Reynolds numbers. The gas drift velocity is nothing but the drift
velocity defined by Parmentier et al. (AIChE Journal, 2012, 58 (4): 1084-1098),
and in analogy to the gas drift velocity, we defines the solid drift velocity
in the present work. The great relevance of the gas drift velocity and the
scalar variance of solid volume fraction to the filtered drag force have been
demonstrated through numerous correlative analyses of fully resolved
simulations. Present theoretical analysis shows that the gas drift velocity
term is primarily responsible for the drag reduction, whereas the solid drift
velocity term is prone to attenuate this reduction, especially at moderate and
high solid volume fractions. The scalar variance of solid volume fraction term
is found to increase the filtered drag force in the full range of solid volume
fractions. The third-order term has exactly the same coefficient with that of
the variance term, and it mostly attains negative values with the trend to
decrease the filtered drag force.

  Optimization with Asymmetric Information Structure",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a learning approach to analyze dynamic systems with
asymmetric information structure. Instead of adopting a game theoretic setting,
we investigate an online quadratic optimization problem driven by system noises
with unknown statistics. Due to information asymmetry, it is infeasible to use
classic Kalman filter nor optimal control strategies for such systems. It is
necessary and beneficial to develop a robust approach that learns the
probability statistics as time goes forward. Motivated by online convex
optimization (OCO) theory, we introduce the notion of regret, which is defined
as the cumulative performance loss difference between the optimal offline known
statistics cost and the optimal online unknown statistics cost. By utilizing
dynamic programming and linear minimum mean square biased estimate (LMMSUE), we
propose a new type of online state feedback control policies and characterize
the behavior of regret in finite time regime. The regret is shown to be
sub-linear and bounded by O(ln T). Moreover, we address an online optimization
problem with output feedback control policies.

individuals. There has been substantial discussion about whether these
algorithms are unfair to groups of individuals. While noble, this pursuit is
complex and ultimately stagnating because there is no clear definition of
fairness and competing definitions are largely incompatible. We argue that the
focus on the question of fairness is misplaced, as these algorithms fail to
meet a more important and yet readily obtainable goal: transparency. As a
result, creators of secret algorithms can provide incomplete or misleading
descriptions about how their models work, and various other kinds of errors can
easily go unnoticed. By partially reverse engineering the COMPAS algorithm -- a
recidivism-risk scoring algorithm used throughout the criminal justice system
-- we show that it does not seem to depend linearly on the defendant's age,
despite statements to the contrary by the algorithm's creator. Furthermore, by
subtracting from COMPAS its (hypothesized) nonlinear age component, we show
that COMPAS does not necessarily depend on race, contradicting ProPublica's
analysis, which assumed linearity in age. In other words, faulty assumptions
about a proprietary algorithm lead to faulty conclusions that go unchecked
without careful reverse engineering. Were the algorithm transparent in the
first place, this would likely not have occurred. The most important result in
this work is that we find that there are many defendants with low risk score
but long criminal histories, suggesting that data inconsistencies occur
frequently in criminal justice databases. We argue that transparency satisfies
a different notion of procedural fairness by providing both the defendants and
the public with the opportunity to scrutinize the methodology and calculations
behind risk scores for recidivism.

consider the cell-edge user (CEU) scenario, where both sides have the demand to
improve the quality of experience or service. Therefore, CEUs and D2D users
both have intentions to form pairs, namely, CEU-D2D pairs, to cooperate
mutually. Different from the conventional equilibrium point evaluation, the
stable matching between D2D users and CEUs are formulated under matching theory

common data sanitization defenses, including anomaly detectors based on nearest

near one another, and (ii) we formulate each attack as a constrained
optimization problem, with constraints designed to ensure that the poisoned
points evade detection. As this optimization involves solving an expensive

distributed systems, peer-to-peer systems, and game theory. In this paper we
argue that blockchain algorithms should tolerate both rational

all non-Byzantine users are altruistic and follow the protocols blindly. Such
algorithms are called BAR-tolerant [1]. To design a BAR-tolerant system, one
can follow these three steps: clearly define the utility function for the
rational users, prove the algorithm is such that there is no benefit from
unilaterally deviating (that is, it's a Byzantine Nash Equilibrium), then prove
the algorithm correct assuming the rational actors follow the protocol. We
present an example attack by rational users: the gatekeeping attack, where
members of a system selfishly decide to prevent newcomers from joining. This
attack may affect any stake-based system where the existing members prevent
newcomers from making a stake, and essentially form a cartel. We then sketch a
BAR-tolerant consensus protocol for blockchain that can defend against this
attack. It relies on a strict order to decide who gets to propose a new block
(so there's no need to race to solve a crypto puzzle) and it relies on hardware
ID tokens to make sure every computer is only represented at most once as a
block proposer to mitigate Sybil attacks. It also defends against the
gatekeeper attack. The BAR-tolerant approach is naturally also applicable to
other blockchain algorithms.

Hall graphene nanoribbon with a magnetic quantum dot. Such a magnetic quantum
dot localizes Dirac fermions exhibiting anisotropic eigenenergy spectra with
broken time-reversal symmetry. Interplay between the localized states and
quantum Hall edge states is found to be two-fold, showing Breit-Wigner and Fano
resonances, which is reminiscent of a double quantum dot system. By fitting the
numerical results with the Fano-Breit-Wigner lineshape from the double quantum
dot model, we demonstrate that the two-fold resonance is due to the valley
mixing that comes from the coupling of the magnetic quantum dot with quantum
Hall edge channels; an effective double quantum dot system emerges from a
single magnetic quantum dot in virtue of the valley degree of freedom. It is
further confirmed that the coupling is weaker for the Fano resonance and
stronger for the Breit-Wigner resonace.

  Recognition","Accepted to Proc. AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recognizing irregular text in natural scene images is challenging due to the
large variance in text appearance, such as curvature, orientation and
distortion. Most existing approaches rely heavily on sophisticated model
designs and/or extra fine-grained annotations, which, to some extent, increase
the difficulty in algorithm implementation and data collection. In this work,
we propose an easy-to-implement strong baseline for irregular scene text
recognition, using off-the-shelf neural network components and only word-level
annotations. It is composed of a $31$-layer ResNet, an LSTM-based
encoder-decoder framework and a 2-dimensional attention module. Despite its
simplicity, the proposed method is robust and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both regular and irregular scene text recognition benchmarks.

confident risk-stratification - the risk estimates of the different patients
reflect the true risks with a high probability. This allows him/her to use
these risks to make accurate predictions about prognosis and decisions about
screening, treatments for the current patient. We develop Risk-stratify - a two
phase algorithm that is designed to achieve confident risk-stratification. In
the first phase, we grow a tree to partition the covariate space. Each node in
the tree is split using statistical tests that determine if the risks of the
child nodes are different or not. The choice of the statistical tests depends
on whether the data is censored (Log-rank test) or not (U-test). The set of the
leaves of the tree form a partition. The risk distribution of patients that
belong to a leaf is different from the sibling leaf but not the rest of the
leaves. Therefore, some of the leaves that have similar underlying risks are
incorrectly specified to have different risks. In the second phase, we develop
a novel recursive graph decomposition approach to address this problem. We
merge the leaves of the tree that have similar risks to form new leaves that
form the final output. We apply Risk-stratify on a cohort of patients (with no
history of cardiovascular disease) from UK Biobank and assess their risk for
cardiovascular disease. Risk-stratify significantly improves
risk-stratification, i.e., a lower fraction of the groups have over/under
estimated risks (measured in terms of false discovery rate; 33% reduction) in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods for cardiovascular prediction (Random
forests, Cox model, etc.). We find that the Cox model significantly over
estimates the risk of 21,621 patients out of 216,211 patients. Risk-stratify
can accurately categorize 2,987 of these 21,621 patients as low-risk
individuals.

flow profiles. Our simulations discover such a behaviour for an initial
Taylor-Green (TG) type of flow whereas under identical conditions an initial
Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) flow fails to show recurrent behaviour. This
difference in the dynamical behaviours is traced to the nature of the Rayleigh
quotient in each case. The Rayleigh quotient which is an approximate measure of
the number of active degrees of freedom in a dynamical system is found to
remain small and bounded in time for the TG flow but grows indefinitely in time
for the ABC flow. An estimate of the effective degrees of freedom for the TG
flow case is provided and its practical implications for the nonlinear
behaviour of the continuum nonlinear MHD plasma system is discussed.

  Gaussian Processes",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How can we efficiently gather information to optimize an unknown function,
when presented with multiple, mutually dependent information sources with
different costs? For example, when optimizing a robotic system, intelligently
trading off computer simulations and real robot testings can lead to
significant savings. Existing methods, such as multi-fidelity GP-UCB or Entropy
Search-based approaches, either make simplistic assumptions on the interaction
among different fidelities or use simple heuristics that lack theoretical
guarantees. In this paper, we study multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization with
complex structural dependencies among multiple outputs, and propose
MF-MI-Greedy, a principled algorithmic framework for addressing this problem.
In particular, we model different fidelities using additive Gaussian processes
based on shared latent structures with the target function. Then we use
cost-sensitive mutual information gain for efficient Bayesian global
optimization. We propose a simple notion of regret which incorporates the cost
of different fidelities, and prove that MF-MI-Greedy achieves low regret. We
demonstrate the strong empirical performance of our algorithm on both synthetic
and real-world datasets.

a mathematical framework for proving the linearizability of distributed
systems. The proof in this approach is divided into two stages of lower and
higher abstraction level. At the higher level a list of ""axioms"" is formulated
and a proof is given that any model theoretic structure that satisfies these
axioms is linearizable. At this level the algorithm is not mentioned. At the
lower level, a Simpler Lazy Set algorithm is described, and it is shown that
any execution of this simpler algorithm generates a model of these axioms (and
is therefore linearizable). Finally the linearization of the Lazy Set algorithm
is obtained by proving that any of its executions has a {\em reduct} that is an
execution of the Simpler algorithm. So the reduct executions are linearizable
and this entails immediately linearizability of the Lazy Set algorithm itself.

  the Royal Astronomical Society",,"10.1093/mnras/sty3023",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A long-term sublimation model to explain how Phaethon could provide the
Geminid stream is proposed. We find that it would take $\sim6$ Myr or more for
Phaethon to lose all of its internal ice (if ever there was) in its present
orbit. Thus, if the asteroid moved from the region of a 5:2 or 8:3 mean motion
resonance with Jupiter to its present orbit less than $1$ Myr ago, it may have
retained much of its primordial ice. The dust mantle on the sublimating body
should have a thickness of at least $15$ m but the mantle could have been less
than $1$ m thick $1000$ years ago. We find that the total gas production rate
could have been as large as $10^{27}\rm~s^{-1}$ then, and the gas flow could
have been capable of lifting dust particles of up to a few centimeters in size.
Therefore, gas production during the past millennium could have been sufficient
to blow away enough dust particles to explain the entire Geminid stream. For
present-day Phaethon, the gas production is comparatively weak. But strong
transient gas release with a rate of $\sim4.5\times10^{19}\rm~m^{-2}s^{-1}$ is
expected for its south polar region when Phaethon moves from $0^\circ$ to
$2^\circ$ mean anomaly near perihelion. Consequently, dust particles with radii
of $<\sim260~\mu m$ can be blown away to form a dust tail. In addition, we find
that the large surface temperature variation of $>600$ K near perihelion can
generate sufficiently large thermal stress to cause fracture of rocks or
boulders and provide an efficient mechanism to produce dust particles on the
surface. The time scale for this process should be several times longer than
the seasonal thermal cycle, thereby dominating the cycle of appearance of the
dust tail.

transversely-resolved synchrotron emission and the prediction of the jet trace
from optical spectroscopy: this is an a priori prediction not an a posteriori
fit, confirming the ballistic nature of the jet propagation. The mm-wavelength
of the ALMA polarimetry is sufficiently short that the Faraday rotation is
negligible and therefore that the observed E-vector directions are accurately
orthogonal to the projected local magnetic field. Close to the nucleus the
B-field vectors are perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Further out
from the nucleus, the B-field vectors that are coincident with the jet instead
become parallel to the ridge line; this occurs at a distance where the jet
bolides are expected to expand into one another. X-ray variability has also
been observed at this location; this has a natural explanation if shocks from
the expanding and colliding bolides cause particle acceleration. In regions
distinctly separate from the jet ridge line, the fractional polarisation

eXtreme Gradient Boosting to predict protein-ligand affinities in KIBA and
BindingDB data sets. ChemBoost was able to predict drug-target binding affinity

powered with ligand-centric representations, ChemBoost was more robust to the

adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). The proposed technique is aimed at
solving explicitly constrained black-box continuous optimization problems, in
which the explicit constraint is a constraint whereby the computational time
for the constraint violation and its (numerical) gradient are negligible
compared to that for the objective function. This method is designed to realize
two invariance properties: invariance to the affine transformation of the
search space, and invariance to the increasing transformation of the objective
and constraint functions. The CMA-ES is designed to possess these properties
for handling difficulties that appear in black-box optimization problems, such
as non-separability, ill-conditioning, ruggedness, and the different orders of
magnitude in the objective. The proposed constraint-handling technique (CHT),
known as ARCH, modifies the underlying CMA-ES only in terms of the ranking of
the candidate solutions. It employs a repair operator and an adaptive ranking
aggregation strategy to compute the ranking. We developed test problems to
evaluate the effects of the invariance properties, and performed experiments to
empirically verify the invariance of the algorithm. We compared the proposed
method with other CHTs on the CEC 2006 constrained optimization benchmark suite
to demonstrate its efficacy. Empirical studies reveal that ARCH is able to
exploit the explicitness of the constraint functions effectively, sometimes
even more efficiently than an existing box-constraint handling technique on
box-constrained problems, while exhibiting the invariance properties. Moreover,
ARCH overwhelmingly outperforms CHTs by not exploiting the explicit constraints
in terms of the number of objective function calls.

  Avella-Alaminos--Geiss invariants","48 pages",,,,"math.RA math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Among finite dimensional algebras over a field $K$, the class of gentle
algebras is known to be closed by derived equivalences. Although a
classification up to derived equivalences is usually a difficult problem,
Avella-Alaminos and Geiss have introduced derived invariants for gentle
algebras $A$, which can be calculated combinatorially from their bound quivers,
applicable to such classification.
  Ladkani has given a formula to describe the dimensions of the Hochschild
cohomologies of $A$ in terms of some values of its Avella-Alaminos--Geiss
invariants. This in turn implies a cohomological meaning of these values. Since
most of the other values do not appear in this formula, it will be a natural
question to ask if there is a similar cohomological meaning for such values. In
this article, we construct a sequence of gentle algebras $A^{(k)}$ indexed by
positive integers by a procedure which we call finite gentle repetitions, in
order to relate these values of Avella-Alaminos--Geiss invariants of $A$ to the
dimensions of Hochschild cohomologies of $A^{(k)}$.
  On the way we will see that the Avella-Alaminos--Geiss invariants of
$A^{(k)}$ are completely determined by those of $A$. Therefore one may expect
that the finite gentle repetitions would preserve derived equivalences in a
nice situation. In the latter part of this article, we deal with this problem
under some assumptions.

experimental techniques to determine the electronic structure of
p-quinquephenyl pyridine (5P-Py) adsorbed on ZnO(10-10). The parent anchoring

causes an occupied in-gap state (IGS) directly below the Fermi level
$E_\text{F}$. Adsorption of upright-standing 5P-Py also leads to a strong work
function reduction of up to 2.1 eV and to a similar IGS. The latter is then
used as an initial state for the transient population of three normally
unoccupied molecular levels through optical excitation and, due to its
localization right at the o/i interface, provides interfacial sensitivity, even
for thick 5P-Py films. We observe two final states above the vacuum level and
one bound state at around 2 eV above $E_\text{F}$, which we attribute to the
5P-Py LUMO. By the separate study of anchoring group and organic dye combined

is the first algorithm to use a DNN to learn and exploit the problem structure
to adapt the variation operator (changing the neighbourhood structure of the

optimisation problems within the MAXSAT class. The Hierarchical Transformation
Optimisation Problem (HTOP) has controllable deep structure that provides a
clear evaluation of how DO works and why using a layerwise technique is
essential for learning and exploiting problem structure. The Parity Modular
Constraint Problem (MCparity) is a simplistic example of a problem containing
higher-order dependencies (greater than pairwise) which DO can solve and state
of the art MBOAs cannot. Further, we show that DO can exploit deep structure in

can find and exploit deep problem structure that other algorithms cannot.
Making this connection between DNNs and optimisation allows for the utilisation
of advanced tools applicable to DNNs that current MBOAs are unable to use.

perform our study considering nuclear equations of state that predict two solar

effect of the presence of hyperons on the radius, the direct Urca processes,
and the cooling of accreting neutron stars are discussed. We show that some
star properties are affected in a similar way by the density dependence of the
symmetry energy and the hyperon content of the star. To disentangle these two
effects it is essential to have a good knowledge of the equation of state at
supra-saturation densities. The density dependence of the symmetry energy
affects the order of appearance of the different hyperons, which may have
direct implications on the neutron star cooling as different hyperonic neutrino
processes processes may operate at the center of massive stars. For models
which allow for the direct Urca process to operate, hyperonic and purely
nucleonic ones are shown to have a similar luminosity when hyperons are
included in agreement with modern experimental data. It is shown that for a
density dependent hadronic model constrained by experimental, theoretical and

a search problem where the prover constructs a proof tree step by step. In this
paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for proof search in
intuitionistic propositional logic. The most significant challenge in the
application of deep learning to the ATP is the absence of large, public theorem
database. We, however, overcame this issue by applying a novel data
augmentation procedure at each iteration of the reinforcement learning. We also
improve the efficiency of the algorithm by representing the syntactic structure
of formulas by a novel compact graph representation. Using the large volume of
augmented data, we train highly accurate graph neural networks that approximate
the value function for the set of the syntactic structures of formulas. Our
method is also cost-efficient in terms of computational time. We will show that
our prover outperforms Coq's $\texttt{tauto}$ tactic, a prover based on
human-engineered heuristics. Within the specified time limit, our prover solved
84% of the theorems in a benchmark library, while $\texttt{tauto}$ was able to
solve only 52%.

This problem is harder to solve than the one when shortest paths of any shape
are sought, since the planer's search space is substantially bigger as multiple
search nodes corresponding to the same location need to be considered. One way
to reduce the search effort is to fix the length of the path's segment and to
prune the nodes that violate the imposed constraint. This leads to
incompleteness and to the sensitivity of the 's performance to chosen parameter
value. In this work we introduce a novel technique that reduces this
sensitivity by automatically adjusting the length of the path's segment
on-the-fly, e.g. during the search. Embedding this technique into the known
grid-based angle-constrained path finding algorithm - LIAN, leads to notable
increase of the planner's effectiveness, e.g. success rate, while keeping
efficiency, e.g. runtime, overhead at reasonable level. Experimental evaluation
shows that LIAN with the suggested enhancements, dubbed eLIAN, solves up to
20\% of tasks more compared to the predecessor. Meanwhile, the solution quality
of eLIAN is nearly the same as the one of LIAN.

electrons are key constituents of many materials with unconventional
properties, such as high-Tc superconductors, Mott insulators and
transition-metal dichalcogenides. Strong electron interaction offers a fast and
efficient lever to manipulate their properties with light, creating promising
potential for next-generation electronics. However, the underlying dynamics is
a fast and intricate interplay of polarization and screening effects, which is
poorly understood. It is hidden below the femtosecond timescale of electronic
thermalization, which follows the light-induced excitation. Here, we
investigate the many-body electron dynamics in transition metals before
thermalization sets in. We combine the sensitivity of intra-shell transitions
to screening effects with attosecond time resolution to uncover the interplay
of photo-absorption and screening. First-principles time-dependent calculations
allow us to assign our experimental observations to ultrafast electronic
localization on d-orbitals. The latter modifies the whole electronic structure
as well as the collective dynamic response of the system on a timescale much
faster than the light-field cycle. Our results demonstrate a possibility for
steering the electronic properties of solids prior to electron thermalization,
suggesting that the ultimate speed of electronic phase transitions is limited
only by the duration of the controlling laser pulse. Furthermore, external
control of the local electronic density serves as a fine tool for testing
state-of-the art models of electron-electron interactions. We anticipate our
study to facilitate further investigations of electronic phase transitions,
laser-metal interactions and photo-absorption in correlated electron systems on

creation of the post, and that code is rarely changed without also updating the

between post edits and comments, (3) a first analysis of code clones on SO
together with an investigation of possible licensing risks. Finally, since the

right-handed charged bosons, W$_\mathrm{R}$, that decay to heavy right-handed
Majorana neutrinos, N$_\ell$ $(\ell = $e, $\mu, \tau)$, arising in a left-right
symmetric extension of the standard model. The model considers that
N$_\mathrm{e}$ and N$_\mu$ are too heavy to be detected at the LHC. Assuming
that the N$_\tau$ mass is half of the W$_\mathrm{R}$ mass, masses of the
W$_\mathrm{R}$ boson below 3.50 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level.
Exclusion limits are also presented considering different scenarios for the
mass ratio between N$_\tau$ and W$_\mathrm{R}$, as a function of W$_\mathrm{R}$
mass. In the second model, pair production of third-generation scalar
leptoquarks that decay into $\tau\tau$bb is considered, resulting in an
observed exclusion region with leptoquark masses below 1.02 TeV, assuming a
100% branching fraction for the leptoquark decay to a $\tau$ lepton and a
bottom quark. These results represent the most stringent limits to date on
these models.

perpendicularly from the HM to the FM due to the spin-Hall effect. By using the

SMGR (which corresponds to smooth accretion from satellites) agrees with the
results of the Millennium-II simulation, predicting low growth rates for low
stellar masses ($10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}-10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) and accelerating
growth for high masses ($10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}-10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$). Using the
derived formulas we study the relative contributions of minor and major mergers
to the total merger SMGR at various redshifts. Minor mergers contribute
$80\%-90\%$ in the low mass range for $z<4$, with major mergers becoming the
dominant merger type (80$\%-95\%$) at relatively high masses ($4\times 10^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$) for $z>1$. This suggests that most merger mass growth is due to
minor mergers. We derive an SMGR formula for the very early universe ($z>4$)

modern population of galaxies. Our overall analysis suggests that dynamical

us to resolve highly filamentary CO distributions with typical widths of
$\sim$0.1 pc (full width half maximum) and line masses of a few 100 $M_{\odot}$

hub-filament structure emanating from the nebular center toward the north. We
identified for the first time two massive protostellar outflows of $\sim$10$^4$

revealed several pillar-like CO features around the Nebula. The H II region and
the pillars have a complementary spatial distribution and the column density of
the pillars is an order of magnitude higher than that of the pillars in the
Eagle nebula (M16) in the Galaxy, suggesting an early stage of pillar formation
with an age younger than $\sim$10$^5$ yr. We suggest that a cloud-cloud
collision triggered the formation of the filaments and protostar within the

the kpc-scale H I flows come from the tidal interaction resulting from the

possible to completely test an application before a release. To cope with the
problem of scarce resources, development teams can apply defect prediction to
identify fault-prone code regions. However, defect prediction tends to low
precision in cross-project prediction scenarios.
  Aims. We take an inverse view on defect prediction and aim to identify
methods that can be deferred when testing because they contain hardly any
faults due to their code being ""trivial"". We expect that characteristics of
such methods might be project-independent, so that our approach could improve
cross-project predictions.
  Method. We compute code metrics and apply association rule mining to create
rules for identifying methods with low fault risk. We conduct an empirical
study to assess our approach with six Java open-source projects containing
precise fault data at the method level.
  Results. Our results show that inverse defect prediction can identify approx.
32-44% of the methods of a project to have a low fault risk; on average, they
are about six times less likely to contain a fault than other methods. In
cross-project predictions with larger, more diversified training sets,
identified methods are even eleven times less likely to contain a fault.
  Conclusions. Inverse defect prediction supports the efficient allocation of
test resources by identifying methods that can be treated with less priority in
testing activities and is well applicable in cross-project prediction
scenarios.

data comes with some information about the network edges. In some cases, this
network information can even be given with multiple views or multiple layers,
each one representing a different type of relationship between the network
nodes. Increasingly often, network nodes also carry a feature vector. We
propose in this paper to extend the node clustering problem, that commonly
considers only the network information, to a problem where both the network
information and the node features are considered together for learning a
clustering-friendly representation of the feature space. Specifically, we
design a generic two-step algorithm for multilayer network data clustering. The
first step aggregates the different layers of network information into a graph
representation given by the geometric mean of the network Laplacian matrices.
The second step uses a neural net to learn a feature embedding that is
consistent with the structure given by the network layers. We propose a novel
algorithm for efficiently training the neural net via stochastic gradient
descent, which encourages the neural net outputs to span the leading
eigenvectors of the aggregated Laplacian matrix, in order to capture the
pairwise interactions on the network, and provide a clustering-friendly
representation of the feature space. We demonstrate with an extensive set of
experiments on synthetic and real datasets that our method leads to a
significant improvement w.r.t. state-of-the-art multilayer graph clustering
algorithms, as it judiciously combines nodes features and network information
in the node embedding algorithms.

combination of SF and composite/LINER-like emission likely due to thermal
conduction or turbulence. The stellar photoionization component of the diffuse

evolution of upflow plumes, descending pillars, and vortex motions has been

instability is thought to be a driver of such internal flows. Descending
pillars are related to the mass budgets of prominences. There is a hypothesis
of dynamic equilibrium where the mass drainage via descending pillars and the
mass supply via radiative condensation are balanced to maintain the prominence
mass; however, the background physics connecting the two different processes is
poorly understood. In this study, we reproduced the dynamic interior of a
prominence via radiative condensation and the mechanism similar to the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability using a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
simulation including optically thin radiative cooling and nonlinear anisotropic
thermal conduction. The process to prominence formation in the simulation
follows the reconnection-condensation model, where topological change in the
magnetic field caused by reconnection leads to radiative condensation.
Reconnection is driven by converging motion at the footpoints of the coronal
arcade fields. In contrast to the previous model, by randomly changing the
speed of the footpoint motion along a polarity inversion line, the dynamic
interior of prominence is successfully reproduced. We find that the mass
condensation rate of the prominence is enhanced in the case with dynamic state.
Our results support the observational hypothesis that the condensation rate is
balanced with the mass drainage rate and suggest that a self-induced mass
maintenance mechanism exists.

Mergesort. While Quicksort is very fast on average, Mergesort additionally
gives worst-case guarantees, but needs extra space for a linear number of
elements. Worst-case efficient in-place sorting, however, remains a challenge:
the standard solution, Heapsort, suffers from a bad cache behavior and is also
not overly fast for in-cache instances.
  In this work we present median-of-medians QuickMergesort (MoMQuickMergesort),
a new variant of QuickMergesort, which combines Quicksort with Mergesort
allowing the latter to be implemented in place. Our new variant applies the
median-of-medians algorithm for selecting pivots in order to circumvent the
quadratic worst case. Indeed, we show that it uses at most $n \log n + 1.6n$
comparisons for $n$ large enough.
  We experimentally confirm the theoretical estimates and show that the new
algorithm outperforms Heapsort by far and is only around 10% slower than
Introsort (std::sort implementation of stdlibc++), which has a rather poor
guarantee for the worst case. We also simulate the worst case, which is only
around 10% slower than the average case. In particular, the new algorithm is a
natural candidate to replace Heapsort as a worst-case stopper in Introsort.

services (CQAs) to model asymmetric relationships among different types of
nodes in CQA graphs, e.g., question, answer, user. Asymmetric transitivity is
an essential property of directed graphs, since it can play an important role
in downstream graph inference and analysis. Question difficulty and user
expertise follow the characteristic of asymmetric transitivity. Maintaining
such properties, while reducing the graph to a lower dimensional vector
embedding space, has been the focus of much recent research. In this paper, we
tackle the challenge of directed graph embedding with asymmetric transitivity
preservation and then leverage the proposed embedding method to solve a
fundamental task in CQAs: how to appropriately route and assign newly posted
questions to users with the suitable expertise and interest in CQAs. The
technique incorporates graph hierarchy and reachability information naturally
by relying on a non-linear transformation that operates on the core
reachability and implicit hierarchy within such graphs. Subsequently, the
methodology levers a factorization-based approach to generate two embedding
vectors for each node within the graph, to capture the asymmetric transitivity.
Extensive experiments show that our framework consistently and significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on two diverse real-world tasks:
link prediction, and question difficulty estimation and expert finding in
online forums like Stack Exchange. Particularly, our framework can support
inductive embedding learning for newly posted questions (unseen nodes during
training), and therefore can properly route and assign these kinds of questions

Several schemes of its implementation have been put forward based on various

put forward an alternative scheme of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum
computation, in which a universal set of quantum gates is realized based on
Rydberg superatoms. A Rydberg superatom is a mesoscopic atomic ensemble that
allows for only a single Rydberg excitation shared by many atoms within a
blockade radius and can be used to generate the collective states to encode the
qubits. In our scheme, the qubit is encoded into two collective ground states
of Rydberg superatoms and the interaction between two long-range Rydberg
superatoms is mediated by a microwave cavity with the aid of two additional
collective Rydberg states. Different from the previous schemes,which are based
on the systems in the microscope scale, the present scheme is based on atomic
ensembles in the mesoscopic scale. Besides the common merits of nonadiabatic
holonomic quantum computation such as the robustness and the speediness, the
Rydberg-superatom-based scheme has the following particular merits: the long
coherence time of Rydberg states and the operability of the mesoscopic systems.

make stable cavities of different sizes, as well as the huge range of
accessible strains, allows us to systematically study the early stages of
cavity expansion. Cavities grow in a scale-free manner, accompanied by
irreversible bond breakage that is distributed around the growing cavity,
rather than being localized to a crack tip. Furthermore, cavities appear to
grow at constant driving pressure. This has strong analogies with the
plasticity that occurs surrounding a growing void in ductile metals. In
particular we find that, although elastomers are normally considered as brittle
materials, small-scale cavity expansion is more like a ductile process. Our
results have broad implications for understanding and controlling failure in

conditions were within error consistent with a liquid phase. On the other hand,
modeling of the subsurface environment would support brine production in the
shallow subsurface. Indeed, we find that the shallow subsurface for terrains
with low thermal inertia ($\Gamma\lesssim 300$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$)
may be occasionally favorable to brine formation through deliquescence.
Terrains with $\Gamma\lesssim175$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$ and albedos of
$\gtrsim0.25$ are the most apt to subsurface brine formation. Should brines

give a non-trivial certified lower bound of minimum adversarial distortion, and
some recent progress has been made towards this direction by exploiting the
piece-wise linear nature of ReLU activations. However, a generic robustness
certification for general activation functions still remains largely
unexplored. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce CROWN, a general
framework to certify robustness of neural networks with general activation

bounding a given activation function with linear and quadratic functions, hence
allowing it to tackle general activation functions including but not limited to
four popular choices: ReLU, tanh, sigmoid and arctan. In addition, we
facilitate the search for a tighter certified lower bound by adaptively
selecting appropriate surrogates for each neuron activation. Experimental
results show that CROWN on ReLU networks can notably improve the certified
lower bounds compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithm Fast-Lin, while
having comparable computational efficiency. Furthermore, CROWN also
demonstrates its effectiveness and flexibility on networks with general

face new challenges in balancing power supply and demand and maintaining the
nominal frequency. This paper studies load control to handle these challenges.
In particular, a fully distributed automatic load control (ALC) algorithm,
which only needs local measurement and local communication, is proposed. We
prove that the load control algorithm globally converges to an optimal
operating point which minimizes the total disutility of users, restores the
nominal frequency and the scheduled tie-line power flows, and respects the load
capacity limits and the thermal constraints of transmission lines. It is
further shown that the asymptotic convergence still holds even when inaccurate
system parameters are used in the control algorithm. In addition, the global
exponential convergence of the reduced ALC algorithm without considering the
capacity limits is proved and leveraged to study the dynamical tracking
performance and robustness of the algorithm. Lastly, the effectiveness,
optimality, and robustness of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated via
numerical simulations.

1960s, when his involvement in the community of quantum physicists became
extensive and quite influential. Thanks to unpublished documents and

the ability to move independently. Instead, they crowd fluid environments in
anticipation of a random encounter with a bacterium. Once they land on the cell
body of their victim, they are able to eject their genetic material inside the
host cell. Many phage species, however, first attach to the flagellar filaments
of bacteria. Being immotile, these so-called flagellotropic phages still manage
to reach the cell body for infection, and the process by which they move up the
flagellar filament has intrigued the scientific community for decades. In 1973,
Berg and Anderson (Nature, 245, 380) proposed the nut-and-bolt mechanism in
which, similarly to a rotated nut that is able to move along a bolt, the phage
wraps itself around a flagellar filament possessing helical grooves (due to the
helical rows of flagellin molecules) and exploits the rotation of the flagellar
filament in order to passively travel along it. One of the main evidence for
this mechanism is the fact that mutants of bacterial species such as
Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium that possess straight flagellar
filaments with a preserved helical groove structure can still be infected by
their relative phages. Using two distinct approaches to address the short-range
interactions between phages and flagellar filaments, we provide here a
first-principle theoretical model for the nut-and-bolt mechanism applicable to
mutants possessing straight flagellar filaments. Our model is fully analytical,
is able to predict the speed of translocation of a bacteriophage along a
flagellar filament as a function of the geometry of both phage and bacterium,
the rotation rate of the flagellar filament, and the handedness of the helical
grooves, and is consistent with past experimental observations.

messages from a source to multiple users in wireless environments. In
particular, two-layered superposition of broadcast/multicast and unicast
signals is considered in a downlink multiuser OFDMA system. In the literature
and industry, the two-layer superposition is often considered as a pragmatic
approach to make a compromise between the simple but suboptimal orthogonal
multiplexing (OM) and the optimal but complex fully-layered non-orthogonal
multiplexing. In this work, we show that only two-layers are necessary to
achieve the maximum sum-rate when the common message has higher priority than
the $K$ individual unicast messages, and OM cannot be sum-rate optimal in
general. We develop an algorithm that finds the optimal power allocation over
the two-layers and across the OFDMA radio resources in static channels and a
class of fading channels. Two main use-cases are considered: i) Multicast and
unicast multiplexing when $K$ users with uplink capabilities request both
common and independent messages, and ii) broadcast and unicast multiplexing
when the common message targets receive-only devices and $K$ users with uplink
capabilities additionally request independent messages. Finally, we develop a
transceiver design for broadcast/multicast and unicast superposition
transmission based on LTE-A-Pro physical layer and show with numerical
evaluations in mobile environments with multipath propagation that the capacity
improvements can be translated into significant practical performance gains
compared to the orthogonal schemes in the 3GPP specifications. We also analyze
the impact of real channel estimation and show that significant gains in terms
of spectral efficiency or coverage area are still available even with
estimation errors and imperfect interference cancellation for the two-layered

to different versions of the same library being loaded into the same document
at the same time. Furthermore, we find that libraries included transitively, or
via ad and tracking code, are more likely to be vulnerable. This demonstrates
that not only website administrators, but also the dynamic architecture and
developers of third-party services are to blame for the Web's poor state of
library management.
  The results of our work underline the need for more thorough approaches to
dependency management, code maintenance and third-party code inclusion on the
Web.

also an increasingly popular vector for attacks. Due to the high degree of
privilege extensions can hold, extensions have been abused to inject
advertisements into web pages that divert revenue from content publishers and
potentially expose users to malware. Users are often unaware of such practices,
believing the modifications to the page originate from publishers.
Additionally, automated identification of unwanted third-party modifications is
fundamentally difficult, as users are the ultimate arbiters of whether content
is undesired in the absence of outright malice.
  To resolve this dilemma, we present a fine-grained approach to tracking the
provenance of web content at the level of individual DOM elements. In
conjunction with visual indicators, provenance information can be used to
reliably determine the source of content modifications, distinguishing
publisher content from content that originates from third parties such as
extensions. We describe a prototype implementation of the approach called
OriginTracer for Chromium, and evaluate its effectiveness, usability, and
performance overhead through a user study and automated experiments. The
results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the ability of
users to identify unwanted third-party content such as injected ads with modest

privacy associated with online tracking. Alarmingly, these surveys also reveal
that people are also unaware of the amount of data sharing that occurs between
ad exchanges, and thus underestimate the privacy risks associated with online
tracking.
  In reality, the modern ad ecosystem is fueled by a flow of user data between
trackers and ad exchanges. Although recent work has shown that ad exchanges
routinely perform cookie matching with other exchanges, these studies are based
on brittle heuristics that cannot detect all forms of information sharing,
especially under adversarial conditions.
  In this study, we develop a methodology that is able to detect client- and
server-side flows of information between arbitrary ad exchanges. Our key
insight is to leverage retargeted ads as a tool for identifying information
flows. Intuitively, our methodology works because it relies on the semantics of
how exchanges serve ads, rather than focusing on specific cookie matching
mechanisms. Using crawled data on 35,448 ad impressions, we show that our
methodology can successfully categorize four different kinds of information
sharing behavior between ad exchanges, including cases where existing heuristic
methods fail.
  We conclude with a discussion of how our findings and methodologies can be
leveraged to give users more control over what kind of ads they see and how
their information is shared between ad exchanges.

browsing sessions with increasing frequency to inject third-party content

users of these websites, unbeknownst to both website operators and users.
Because of the often highly dynamic nature of these inclusions as well as the
use of advanced cloaking techniques in contemporary malware, it is exceedingly
difficult to preemptively recognize and block inclusions of malicious
third-party content before it has the chance to attack the user's system. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach to achieving the goal of preemptive

as a set of modifications to the Chromium browser that protects users from
malicious inclusions while web pages load. Our analysis suggests that by
adopting our in-browser approach, users can avoid a significant portion of
malicious third-party content on the Web. Our evaluation shows that Excision
effectively identifies malicious content while introducing a low false positive

statistically significant improvement of the fit with respect to a simple
Gaussian or diskline model to fit the iron line, implying that the reflection
continuum is also significantly detected. Despite the differences evident
between the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectra, the smearing best-fit parameters
found for these spectra are consistent with each other and are compatible with
previous results. In particular, we find an upper limit to the inner disk
radius of $\sim 12~R_g$. In all the cases, a high inclination angle

Influence of temperature is studied on density distribution, charge
form-factor, single particle (s.p.) energies, occupancy, deformation and the
depletion fraction (DF). At T $=$ 0, the quenching effect of deformation is
predominant. DF is found usually less in oblate deformation than in prolate. DF
decreases with increasing prolate deformation even though the 2s-orbit is empty
which shows the role of deformation in central depletion apart from the
unoccupancy in s-orbit as is usually believed. As T increases, the occupancy of
s-orbit increases, shell structure melts, the deformation vanishes and the
weakening of central depletion is solely due to the temperature. The bubble
effect is eliminated at T $\approx$ 3$-$5 MeV as indicated by DF and the charge
form factor. The temperature effect is found less prominent in superheavy
bubble nuclei where the role of shell effects is indicated.

known that $n$-fold ILPs can be solved in FPT time regarding the parameters $s,
r,$ and $\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the greatest absolute value of an entry in
$\mathcal A$. The state-of-the-art technique is a local search algorithm that
subsequently moves in an improving direction. Both, the number of iterations
and the search for such an improving direction take time $\Omega(n)$, leading
to a quadratic running time in $n$. We introduce a technique based on Color
Coding, which allows us to compute these improving directions in logarithmic
time after a single initialization step. This leads to the first algorithm for

eliminate the need for expert knowledge such as pronunciation dictionaries to
build ASR systems, it still requires a large amount of paired data, i.e.,
speech utterances and their transcriptions. Cycle-consistency losses have been
recently proposed as a way to mitigate the problem of limited paired data.
These approaches compose a reverse operation with a given transformation, e.g.,
text-to-speech (TTS) with ASR, to build a loss that only requires unsupervised
data, speech in this example. Applying cycle consistency to ASR models is not
trivial since fundamental information, such as speaker traits, are lost in the
intermediate text bottleneck. To solve this problem, this work presents a loss
that is based on the speech encoder state sequence instead of the raw speech
signal. This is achieved by training a Text-To-Encoder model and defining a
loss based on the encoder reconstruction error. Experimental results on the
LibriSpeech corpus show that the proposed cycle-consistency training reduced
the word error rate by 14.7% from an initial model trained with 100-hour paired

CS (5-4) lines in 7 proto-BDs. The hydrogen column density for the proto-BDs
derived from the CO gas emission is $\sim$2-15 times lower than that derived
from the dust continuum emission, indicating CO depletion from the gas-phase.
The mean H$_{2}$CO ortho-to-para ratio is $\sim$3 for the proto-BDs and
indicates gas-phase formation for H$_{2}$CO. We have investigated the
correlations in the molecular abundances between the proto-BDs and protostars.
Proto-BDs on average show a factor of $\sim$2 higher ortho-to-para H$_{2}$CO
ratio than the protostars. Possible explanations include a difference in the
H$_{2}$CO formation mechanism, spin-selective photo-dissociation,
self-shielding effects, or different emitting regions for the ortho and para
species. There is a tentative trend of a decline in the HCO$^{+}$ and H$_{2}$CO
abundances with decreasing bolometric luminosity, while the CS and CO
abundances show no particular difference between the proto-BDs and protostars.
These trends reflect the scaled-down physical structures for the proto-BDs
compared to protostars and differences in the peak emitting regions for these
species. The C$^{17}$O isotopologue is detected in all of the proto-BDs as well
as the more evolved Class Flat/Class II BDs in our sample, and can probe the
quiescent gas at both early and late evolutionary stages.

learning. In 2009, Harrow et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 150502 (2009)] showed
that their HHL algorithm can be used to sample the solution of a linear system
$\mathbf{Ax=b}$ exponentially faster than any existing classical algorithm,
with some manageable caveats. The entire field of quantum machine learning
gained considerable traction after the discovery of this celebrated algorithm.
However, effective practical applications and experimental implementations of
HHL are still sparse in the literature. Here, we demonstrate a potential
practical utility of HHL, in the context of regression analysis, using the
remarkable fact that there exists a natural reduction of any multiple linear
regression problem to an equivalent linear systems problem. We put forward a
$7$-qubit quantum circuit design, motivated from an earlier work by Cao et al.
[Mol. Phys. 110, 1675 (2012)], to solve a $3$-variable regression problem,
using only elementary quantum gates. We also implement the Group Leaders
Optimization Algorithm (GLOA) [Mol. Phys. 109 (5), 761 (2011)] and elaborate on
the advantages of using such stochastic algorithms in creating low-cost circuit
approximations for the Hamiltonian simulation. We believe that this application
of GLOA and similar stochastic algorithms in circuit approximation will boost
time- and cost-efficient circuit designing for various quantum machine learning
protocols. Further, we discuss our Qiskit simulation and explore certain
generalizations to the circuit design.

applications, such as item categorization, web page tagging, and news
annotation. Traditionally most methods used bag-of-words (BOW) as inputs,
ignoring word context as well as deep semantic information. Recent attempts to
overcome the problems of BOW by deep learning still suffer from 1) failing to
capture the important subtext for each label and 2) lack of scalability against
the huge number of labels. We propose a new label tree-based deep learning

attention mechanism with raw text as input, which allows to capture the most
relevant part of text to each label; and 2) a shallow and wide probabilistic
label tree (PLT), which allows to handle millions of labels, especially for
""tail labels"". We empirically compared the performance of AttentionXML with
those of eight state-of-the-art methods over six benchmark datasets, including
Amazon-3M with around 3 million labels. AttentionXML outperformed all competing
methods under all experimental settings. Experimental results also show that
AttentionXML achieved the best performance against tail labels among label

paper, we study a possible extension of this method to an asymptotically

in DES is how to estimate the competence of each classifier in a pool to select
the most competent ones. In order to deal with this issue, we proposed a novel
dynamic ensemble selection framework using meta-learning, called META-DES. The
framework is divided into three steps. In the first step, the pool of

meta-features are computed using the training data and used to train a

training of the meta-classifier. For the generalization phase, three
combination approaches are evaluated: Dynamic selection, where only the
classifiers that attain a certain competence level are selected; Dynamic
weighting, where the meta-classifier estimates the competence of each
classifier in the pool, and the outputs of all classifiers in the pool are
weighted based on their level of competence; and a hybrid approach, in which
first an ensemble with the most competent classifiers is selected, after which
the weights of the selected classifiers are estimated in order to be used in a
weighted majority voting scheme. Experiments are carried out on 30
classification datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the changes

of its design parameters, we establish a theoretical framework that takes into
account the channel particularities, the integration area of the internal unit,
the transceivers misalignment, and the characteristics of the optical units. To
this end, we derive explicit expressions for the corresponding average
signal-to-noise-ratio, outage probability, ergodic spectral efficiency and
capacity of the transcutaneous optical link (TOL). These expressions are
subsequently used to assess the dependence of the TOL's communication quality
on the transceivers design parameters and the corresponding channels
characteristics. The offered analytic results are corroborated with respective
results from Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings reveal that OWCI is a
particularly promising architecture that drastically increases the reliability
and effectiveness of the CI TOL, whilst it requires considerably lower transmit
power compared to the corresponding widely-used radio frequency (RF) solution.

  Network Analysis",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning a similarity metric has gained much attention recently, where the
goal is to learn a function that maps input patterns to a target space while
preserving the semantic distance in the input space. While most related work
focused on images, we focus instead on learning a similarity metric for
neuroimages, such as fMRI and DTI images. We propose an end-to-end similarity
learning framework called Higher-order Siamese GCN for multi-subject fMRI data
analysis. The proposed framework learns the brain network representations via a
supervised metric-based approach with siamese neural networks using two graph
convolutional networks as the twin networks. Our proposed framework performs
higher-order convolutions by incorporating higher-order proximity in graph
convolutional networks to characterize and learn the community structure in
brain connectivity networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
community-preserving similarity learning framework for multi-subject brain
network analysis. Experimental results on four real fMRI datasets demonstrate
the potential use cases of the proposed framework for multi-subject brain
analysis in health and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our proposed approach
achieves an average AUC gain of 75% compared to PCA, an average AUC gain of
65.5% compared to Spectral Embedding, and an average AUC gain of 24.3% compared
to S-GCN across the four datasets, indicating promising application in clinical
investigation and brain disease diagnosis.

calibrated simultaneously rather than independently as in the state-of-the-art.
This is shown to significantly reduce the bias inherent to sequential
calibration methods. In addition, this procedure requires no reference sample,
it allows calibration both in transmission or in reflection modes, and it
relies on ready-to-use cameras. Put together, these novelties should help
non-specialists in optics designing and calibrating a Mueller imaging
polarimeter for applications such as material classification.

bounded gap of the minimum power level required for stabilizing the network.

covering this gap by first solving numerically the characteristic equation

information technology, e.g., for storing and sharing data in the web service
which is sustained by a company or third party instead of storing data in a
hard drive or other devices. It is essentially a physical storage system which
provides large storage of data and faster computing to users over the Internet.
In this cloud system, the third party allows to preserve data of clients or
users only for business purpose and also for a limited period of time. The
users are used to share data confidentially among themselves and to store data
virtually to save the cost of physical devices as well as the time. In this
paper, we propose a discrete dynamical system for cloud computing and data
management of the storage service between a third party and users. A framework,
comprised of different techniques and procedures for distribution of storage
and their implementation with users and the third party is given. For
illustration purpose, the model is considered for two users and a third party,
and its dynamical properties are briefly analyzed and discussed. It is shown
that the discrete system exhibits periodic, quasiperiodic and chaotic states.
The latter discerns that the cloud computing system with distribution of data
and storage between users and the third party may be secured. Some issues of
data security are discussed and a random replication scheme is proposed to
ensure that the data loss can be highly reduced compared to the existing
schemes in the literature.
