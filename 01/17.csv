emphasis on the search for light hybrid mesons. To this end, a
linearly-polarized $9\,$GeV photon beam impinges on a hydrogen target contained
within a hermetic detector with near-complete neutral and charged particle
coverage. In 2016, the experiment completed its commissioning and subsequently
started to take data in its design configuration. With the size of the data set
so far, GlueX already exceeds previous experiments for polarized
photoproduction in this energy regime. A selection of early results will be
presented, focusing on beam asymmetries for pseudo-scalar and vector mesons.
The potential to make significant contributions to the field of light-meson
spectroscopy is highlighted by the observation of several known meson
resonances. Furthermore, the strategy to map the light meson spectrum with
amplitude analysis tools will be outlined.

plane-wave soliton (PWS) and a stripe soliton (SS). These quasi-1D solitons
cannot exist in a condensate with purely repulsive contact interactions and SO

our findings also show the possibility of creating PWSs and SSs. When the
strengths of the two interactions are close to each other, the SS develops an
oscillatory instability indicating a possibility of a breather solution,
eventually leading to its destruction. We also obtain a phase diagram showing
regions where the solution is a PWS or SS.

HMI magnetograms show that the minifilaments reside along a magnetic neutral

These patches converge and cancel with each other, with an average cancelation
rate of ~0.6 X 10$^18 Mx hr^{-1} for all 13 jets. Persistent flux cancelation
at the neutral line eventually destabilizes the minifilament field, which
erupts outward and produces the jet spire. Thus, we find that all 13

cancelation at the neutral line. These results are in agreement with our recent
findings Panesar et al 2016b for quiet-region jets, where flux cancelation at

emission associated with $22$ of the $40$ dwarf galaxies, $8$ of which are new
detections. The general picture is that of an interstellar medium largely
devoid of radio continuum emission, interspersed by isolated pockets of
emission associated with star formation. We find an average thermal fraction of
$\sim 50$-$70$% and an average magnetic field strength of $\sim 5$-$8\,{\rm \mu
G}$, only slightly lower than that found in larger, spiral galaxies. At 100 pc
scales, we find surprisingly high values for the average magnetic field
strength of up to 50$\,{\rm \mu G}$. We find that dwarf galaxies follow the
theoretical predictions of the radio continuum-star formation rate relation
within regions of significant radio continuum emission but that the non-thermal
radio continuum is suppressed relative to the star formation rate when
considering the entire optical disk. We examine the far-infrared-star formation
rate relation for our sample and find that the far-infrared is suppressed
compared to the expected star formation rate. We discuss explanations for these
observed relations and the impact of our findings on the radio
continuum-far-infrared relation. We conclude that radio continuum emission at
centimetre wavelengths has the promise of being a largely extinction-free star
formation rate indicator. We find that star formation rates of gas rich, low

multipath taps, and we allocate $\tilde{M}$ sub-carriers for the channel state

($L$ times compared to the conventional CSI estimation approach) in a massive

based scheduling to transmit their data on each sub-carrier with the proposed
joint beamforming and scheduling design. We employ the well known maximum ratio

All the analytical expressions are validated via numerical results, and the
superiority of the proposed design over the conventional orthogonal frequency

  Dynamics Investigation",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In spite of years of intense research, graphene continues to produce
surprising results. Recently, it was experimentally observed that under certain
conditions graphene can self-drive its tearing and peeling from substrates.
This process can generate long, micrometer sized, folded nanoribbons without
the action of any external forces. Also, during this cracking-like propagation
process, the width of the graphene folded ribbon continuously decreases and the
process only stops when the width reaches about few hundreds nanometers in
size. It is believed that interplay between the strain energy of folded
regions, breaking of carbon-carbon covalent bonds, and adhesion of
graphene-graphene and graphene-substrate are the most fundamental features of
this process, although the detailed mechanisms at atomic scale remain unclear.
In order to gain further insights on these processes we carried out fully
atomistic reactive molecular dynamics simulations using the AIREBO potential as
available in the LAMMPS computational package. Although the reported
tearing/peeling experimental observations were only to micrometer sized
structures, our results showed that they could also occur at nanometer scale.
Our preliminary results suggest that the graphene tearing/peeling process
originates from thermal energy fluctuations that results in broken bonds,
followed by strain release that creates a local elastic wave that can either
reinforce the process, similar to a whip cracking propagation, or undermine it
by producing carbon dangling bonds that evolve to the formation of bonds
between the two layers of graphene. As the process continues in time and the
folded graphene decreases in width, the carbon-carbon bonds at the ribbon edge
and interlayer bonds get less stressed, thermal fluctuations become unable to
break them and the process stops.

sensor selection in het- erogeneous sensor networks. We consider the case where
two types of sensors are deployed: the first consists of expensive, high
quality sensors; and the second, of cheap low quality sensors, which are
activated only if the intensity of the spatial field exceeds a pre-defined
activation threshold (eg. wind sensors). In addition, these sensors are powered
by means of energy harvesting and their time varying energy status impacts on
the accuracy of the measurement that may be obtained. We account for this
phenomenon by encoding the energy harvesting process into the second moment
properties of the additive noise, resulting in a spatial heteroscedastic
process. We then address the following two important problems: (i) how to
efficiently perform spatial field reconstruction based on measurements obtained
simultaneously from both networks; and (ii) how to perform query based sensor
set selection with predictive MSE performance guarantee. We first show that the
resulting predictive posterior distribution, which is key in fusing such
disparate observations, involves solving intractable integrals. To overcome
this problem, we solve the first problem by developing a low complexity
algorithm based on the spatial best linear unbiased estimator (S-BLUE). Next,
building on the S-BLUE, we address the second problem, and develop an efficient
algorithm for query based sensor set selection with performance guarantee. Our
algorithm is based on the Cross Entropy method which solves the combinatorial
optimization problem in an efficient manner. We present a comprehensive study
of the performance gain that can be obtained by augmenting the high-quality

filtering polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps. Unlike conventional
preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) solvers, our preconditioner-free
technique can deal with high-resolution joint temperature and polarization maps
with inhomogeneous noise distributions and arbitrary mask geometries with
relative ease. Various convergence diagnostics illustrate the high quality of
the dual messenger reconstruction. In contrast, the PCG implementation fails to
converge to a reasonable solution for the specific problem considered. The
implementation of the dual messenger method is straightforward and guarantees
numerical stability and convergence. We show how the algorithm can be modified
to generate fluctuation maps, which, combined with the Wiener filter solution,
yield unbiased constrained signal realizations, consistent with observed data.
This algorithm presents a pathway to exact global analyses of high-resolution
and high-sensitivity CMB data for a statistically optimal separation of E and B
modes. It is therefore relevant for current and next-generation CMB
experiments, in the quest for the elusive primordial B-mode signal.

interface reconstruction step of isoAdvector, and demonstrate that especially
for unstructured meshes the applied isosurface based approach can lead to noisy
interface orientations. We then introduce a novel computational interface
reconstruction scheme based on calculation of a reconstructed distance function
(RDF). By iterating over the RDF calculation and interface reconstruction, we
obtain second order convergence of both the interface normal and position
within cells even with a strict $L_{\infty}$ error norm. In 2D this is verified
with reconstruction of a circle on Cartesian meshes and on unstructured
triangular and polygonal prism meshes. In 3D the second order convergence is
verified with reconstruction of a sphere on Cartesian meshes and on
unstructured tetrahedral and polyhedral meshes. The new scheme is combined with
the interface advection step of the isoAdvector algorithm. Significantly
reduced absolute advection errors are obtained, and for CFL number 0.2 and
below we demonstrate second order convergence on all the mentioned mesh types
in 2D and 3D. The implementation of the proposed interface reconstruction
schemes is straightforward and the computational cost is significantly reduced

Sun, late-type stars, accretion disks, galaxies, and the early Universe are
discussed. We focus particularly on aspects of spatio-temporal nonlocality,
which is one of the main insights that emerged from applying the test-field
method to magnetic fields of different length and timescales. We also review
the status of nonlinear quenching and the relation to magnetic helicity, which
is an important observational diagnostic of modern solar dynamo theory. Both
solar and some stellar dynamos seem to operate in an intermediate regime that
has not yet been possible to model successfully. This regime is bracketed by
antisolar-like differential rotation on one end and stellar activity cycles
belonging to the superactive stars on the other. The difficulty in modeling
this regime may be related to shortcomings in modelling solar/stellar
convection. On galactic and extragalactic length scales, the observational
constraints are still less stringent and uncertain, but recent advances both in
theory and in observations suggest that more conclusive comparisons may soon be
possible. The possibility of inversely cascading magnetic helicity throughout
all of the early Universe is particularly exciting in explaining the lower
limits of magnetic fields on cosmological length scales and the possibility of
parity breaking and finite helicity of such a field.

extracting deep feature representations is a significant barrier to its
widespread adoption, particularly for use in embedded devices. One particularly
promising strategy to addressing the complexity issue is the notion of
evolutionary synthesis of deep neural networks, which was demonstrated to
successfully produce highly efficient deep neural networks while retaining
modeling performance. Here, we further extend upon the evolutionary synthesis
strategy for achieving efficient feature extraction via the introduction of a
stress-induced evolutionary synthesis framework, where stress signals are
imposed upon the synapses of a deep neural network during training to induce
stress and steer the synthesis process towards the production of more efficient
deep neural networks over successive generations and improved model fidelity at
a greater efficiency. The proposed stress-induced evolutionary synthesis
approach is evaluated on a variety of different deep neural network
architectures (LeNet5, AlexNet, and YOLOv2) on different tasks (object
classification and object detection) to synthesize efficient StressedNets over
multiple generations. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed framework to synthesize StressedNets with significant improvement in
network architecture efficiency (e.g., 40x for AlexNet and 33x for YOLOv2) and
speed improvements (e.g., 5.5x inference speed-up for YOLOv2 on an Nvidia Tegra
X1 mobile processor).

recent years, with applications ranging from building energy monitoring to

interpretable states and transitions - must be done at scale. As such, we have
seen many recent IoT data sets include annotations with a human expert
specifying states, recorded as a set of boundaries and associated labels in a
data sequence. These data can be used to build automatic labeling algorithms
that produce labels as an expert would. Here, we refer to human-specified
boundaries as breakpoints. Traditional changepoint detection methods only look
for statistically-detectable boundaries that are defined as abrupt variations
in the generative parameters of a data sequence. However, we observe that
breakpoints occur on more subtle boundaries that are non-trivial to detect with
these statistical methods. In this work, we propose a new unsupervised
approach, based on deep learning, that outperforms existing techniques and
learns the more subtle, breakpoint boundaries with a high accuracy. Through
extensive experiments on various real-world data sets - including
human-activity sensing data, speech signals, and electroencephalogram (EEG)

there a most likely noise-induced transition path between these periodic
solutions that allows us to identify a preferred phase of the forcing when
tipping occurs? The quasistatic regime, where the forcing period is long
compared to the adiabatic relaxation time, has been well studied; our work
instead explores the case when these timescales are comparable. We compute
optimal paths using the path integral method incorporating the Onsager-Machlup
functional and validate results with Monte Carlo simulations. Results for the
preferred tipping phase are compared with the deterministic aspects of the
problem. We identify parameter regimes where nullclines, associated with the
deterministic problem in a 2-D extended phase space, form passageways through
which the optimal paths transit. As the nullclines are independent of the
relaxation time and the noise strength, this leads to a robust deterministic
predictor of preferred tipping phase in a regime where forcing is neither too
fast, nor too slow.

parsing databases of existing stations in major cities to devise several

compute the aggregate interference from outdoor 5G-NR users into FSs. We then
present several case studies in dense populated areas, using actual incumbent

coexistence at 70GHz and 80GHz as the majority of FSs experience interference
well below the noise floor thanks to the propagation losses in these bands and
the deployment geometry of the incumbent and 5G systems. For the few FSs that
may incur higher interference, we propose several passive interference
mitigation techniques such as angular-based exclusion zones and spatial power
control. Simulation results show that the techniques can effectively protect
FSs, without tangible degradation of the 5G coverage.

neurologists and affects their performance. Several automatic techniques have
been proposed using traditional approaches to assist neurologists in detecting

These methods do not perform well when classifying ternary case e.g. ictal vs.
normal vs. inter-ictal; the maximum accuracy for this case by the

the bottleneck is the large number of learnable parameters. P-1D-CNN works on
the concept of refinement approach and it results in 60% fewer parameters

small amount of data, we proposed augmentation schemes for learning P-1D-CNN

the outer edge profile is consistent with dynamical evolution models, the sharp

reminiscent of several other disks with similar inclination and scattering
albedos: Fomalhaut, HD 92945, HD 202628, and HD 207129. They are also very
distinct from brighter disks in the same inclination bin, which point to
different compositions between these two populations. Varying scattering albedo
values can be explained by different grain porosities, chemical compositions,
or grain size distributions, which may indicate distinct formation mechanisms
or dynamical processes at work in these systems. Finally, these faint disks
with large infrared excesses may be representative of an underlying population
of systems with low albedo values. Searches with more sensitive instruments on

outskirts of nearby galaxy clusters suggests that chemical elements were
deposited and widely spread into the intergalactic medium before the cluster
formation. This observational evidence is supported by numerical findings from
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, as presented in Biffi et al. (2017),
including the effect of thermal feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here, we
further investigate this picture, by tracing back in time the spatial origin
and metallicity evolution of the gas residing at z=0 in the outskirts of
simulated galaxy clusters. In these regions, we find a large distribution of
iron abundances, including a component of highly-enriched gas, already present
at z=2. At z>1, the gas in the present-day outskirts was distributed over tens
of virial radii from the the main cluster and had been already enriched within
high-redshift haloes. At z=2, about 40% of the most Fe-rich gas at z=0 was not
residing in any halo more massive than 1e11 Msun/h in the region and yet its
average iron abundance was already 0.4, w.r.t. the solar value by Anders &
Grevesse (1989). This confirms that the in situ enrichment of the ICM in the
outskirts of present-day clusters does not play a significant role, and its
uniform metal abundance is rather the consequence of the accretion of both
low-metallicity and pre-enriched (at z>2) gas, from the diffuse component and
through merging substructures. These findings do not depend on the mass of the
cluster nor on its core properties.

If a warp in a disc is too large, the
disc can `break' apart into two or more distinct planes, with only tenuous
connections between them. Further if an initially planar disc is subject to a
strong differential precession, then it can be torn apart into discrete annuli
that precess effectively independently. In previous investigations,
torque-balance formulae have been used to predict where and when the disc
breaks into distinct parts. In this work, focusing on discs with Keplerian
rotation and where the shearing motions driving the radial communication of the
warp are damped locally by turbulence (the `diffusive' regime), we investigate
the stability of warped discs to determine the precise criterion for an
isolated warped disc to break. We find and solve the dispersion relation, which
in general yields three roots. We provide a comprehensive analysis of this
viscous-warp instability and the emergent growth rates and their dependence on
disc parameters. The physics of the instability can be understood as a
combination of (1) a term which would generally encapsulate the classical
Lightman-Eardley instability in planar discs (given by
$\partial(\nu\Sigma)/\partial\Sigma < 0$) but is here modified by the warp to
include $\partial(\nu_1|\psi|)/\partial|\psi| < 0$ and (2) a similar condition
acting on the diffusion of the warp amplitude given in simplified form by
$\partial(\nu_2|\psi|)/\partial|\psi| < 0$. We discuss our findings in the

individual N-body subhaloes in a fixed, analytical host halo potential. By
varying both physical and numerical parameters, we investigate under what
conditions the subhaloes undergo disruption. We confirm the conclusions from
our more analytical assessment in van den Bosch et al. that most disruption is
numerical in origin; as long as a subhalo is resolved with sufficient mass and
force resolution, a bound remnant survives. This implies that state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations still suffer from significant overmerging. We
demonstrate that this is mainly due to inadequate force-softening, which causes
excessive mass loss and artificial tidal disruption. In addition, we show that
subhaloes in N-body simulations are susceptible to a runaway instability
triggered by the amplification of discreteness noise in the presence of a tidal
field. These two processes conspire to put serious limitations on the
reliability of dark matter substructure in state-of-the-art cosmological
simulations. We present two criteria that can be used to assess whether
individual subhaloes in cosmological simulations are reliable or not, and
advocate that subhaloes that satisfy either of these two criteria be discarded
from further analysis. We discuss the potential implications of this work for
several areas in astrophysics.

self-gravitating. We present an analytic determination of the star formation
rate (SFR) in a gravoturbulent medium based on the density probability
distribution function of molecular clouds having a piecewise lognormal and
power law form. This is in contrast to previous analytic SFR models that are
governed primarily by interstellar turbulence which sets purely lognormal
density PDFs. In the gravoturbulent SFR model described herein, low density gas
resides in the lognormal portion of the PDF. Gas becomes gravitationally
unstable past a critical density ($\rho_{crit}$), and the PDF begins to forms a
power law. As the collapse of the cloud proceeds, the transitional density
($\rho_t$) between the lognormal and power law portions of the PDF moves
towards lower-density while the slope of the power law ($\alpha$) becomes
increasingly shallow. The star formation rate per free-fall time is calculated
via an integral over the lognormal from $\rho_{crit}$ to $\rho_t$ and an
integral over the power law from $\rho_t$ to the maximum density. As $\alpha$
becomes shallower the SFR accelerates beyond the expected values calculated
from a lognormal density PDF. We show that the star formation efficiency per
free fall time in observations of local molecular cloud increases with
shallower PDF power law slopes, in agreement with our model. Our model can
explain why star formation is spatially and temporally variable within a cloud
and why the depletion times observed in local and extragalactic giant molecular
clouds vary. Both star-bursting and quiescent star-forming systems can be
explained without the need to invoke extreme variations of turbulence in the
local interstellar environment.

spatial resolution 880$\mu$m continuum images from the Atacama Large Millimeter
Array. The 80au radius dust ring is resolved radially with a characteristic
width of 10au, consistent with the narrow profile seen in scattered light. Our
modelling consistently finds that the disk is also vertically resolved with a
similar extent. However, this extent is less than the beam size, and a disk
that is dynamically very cold (i.e. vertically thin) provides a better
theoretical explanation for the narrow scattered light profile, so we remain
cautious about this conclusion. We do not detect $^{12}$CO J=3-2 emission,
concluding that unless the disk is dynamically cold the CO+CO$_2$ ice content
of the planetesimals is of order a few percent or less. We consider the range
of semi-major axes and masses of an interior planet supposed to cause the
ring's eccentricity, finding that such a planet should be more massive than
Neptune and orbit beyond 40au. Independent of our ALMA observations, we note a
conflict between mid-IR pericenter-glow and scattered light imaging
interpretations, concluding that models where the spatial dust density and
grain size vary around the ring should be explored.

the surface chiral velocity is robust and survives in the presence of strong

applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and finance. In general,
environmental conditions for a stochastic process are not constant on the time
scale of the average first-passage time, or control might be applied to reduce
noise. We investigate moments of the first-passage time distribution under a
transient describing relaxation of environmental conditions. We solve the
Laplace-transformed (generalized) master equation analytically using a novel
method that is applicable to general state schemes. The first-passage time from
one end to the other of a linear chain of states is our application for the
solutions. The dependence of its average on the relaxation rate obeys a power
law for slow transients. The exponent $\nu$ depends on the chain length $N$
like $\nu=-N/(N+1)$ to leading order. Slow transients substantially reduce the
noise of first-passage times expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV),
even if the average first-passage time is much longer than the transient. The
CV has a pronounced minimum for some lengths, which we call resonant lengths.
These results also suggest a simple and efficient noise control strategy, and
are closely related to the timing of repetitive excitations, coherence
resonance and information transmission by noisy excitable systems. A resonant
number of steps from the inhibited state to the excitation threshold and slow
recovery from negative feedback provide optimal timing noise reduction and
information transmission.

Lesser Blum studied for most of his life. As we worked together, Lesser and I
realized that the questions asked of those solutions were quite different in

Information is passed by handfuls of atoms in the genetic code. A few atoms in
the proteins built from the code change macroscopic function. Indeed, a few
atoms often control biological function in the same sense that a gas pedal
controls the speed of a car. Biological questions then are most productive when
they are asked in the context of evolution. What function does a system
perform? How is the system built to perform that function? What forces are used
to perform that function? How are the modules that perform functions connected
to make the machinery of life. Physiologists have shown that much of life is a
nested hierarchy of devices, one on top of another, linking atomic ions in
concentrated solutions to current flow through proteins, current flow to
voltage signals, voltage signals to changes in current flow, all connected to
make a regenerative system that allows electrical action potentials to move
meters, under the control of a few atoms. The hierarchy of devices allows
macroscopic properties to emerge from atomic scale interactions. The structures
of biology create these devices. The concentration and electrical fields of
biology power these devices, more than anything else. The resulting organisms
reproduce. Evolution selects the organisms that reproduce more and thereby
selects the devices that allow macroscopic control to emerge from the atomic
structures of genes and proteins and their motions.

density, particularly in the inner disc region. We also find that models that

application of our models, we address the case of HL Tau, whose disc exhibits a
high accretion rate and efficient dust settling at its midplane. These two
observational features are not easy to reconcile with conventional accretion
disc theory, where the level of turbulence needed to explain the high accretion
rate would prevent a thin dust layer. Our disc model that incorporates both
mass-loss and angular momentum removal by a wind is able to account for HL Tau
observational constraints concerning its high accretion rate and dust layer
thinness.

were likely very dry, yet water is comparatively abundant on Earth. We review
the various mechanisms proposed for the origin of water on the terrestrial

incorporation of water into the local planetesimals in the terrestrial planet
region or into the planets themselves from local sources, although all of those
mechanisms have difficulties. Comets have also been proposed as a source,
although there may be problems fitting isotopic constraints, and the delivery
efficiency is very low, such that it may be difficult to deliver even a single
Earth ocean of water this way. The most promising route for water delivery is
the accretion of material from beyond the snow line, similar to carbonaceous
chondrites, that is scattered into the terrestrial planet region as the planets
are growing. Two main scenarios are discussed in detail. First is the classical
scenario in which the giant planets begin roughly in their final locations and
the disk of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region extends
all the way into the outer asteroid belt region. Second is the Grand Tack
scenario, where early inward and outward migration of the giant planets
implants material from beyond the snow line into the asteroid belt and
terrestrial planet region, where it can be accreted by the growing planets.
Sufficient water is delivered to the terrestrial planets in both scenarios.
While the Grand Tack scenario provides a better fit to most constraints, namely
the small mass of Mars, planets may form too fast in the nominal case discussed
here. This discrepancy may be reduced as a wider range of initial conditions is
explored. Finally, we discuss several more recent models that may have
important implications for water delivery to the terrestrial planets.

the mixing processes in these flows. Here we report on the dispersion of
millimetric air bubbles in a homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow with
Reynolds number $\text{Re}_\lambda$ from $110$ to $310$. We find that the mean
squared displacement (MSD) of the bubbles far exceeds that of fluid tracers in
turbulence. The MSD shows two regimes. At short times, it grows ballistically
($\propto \tau^2$), while at larger times, it approaches the diffusive regime
where MSD $\propto \tau$. Strikingly, for the bubbles, the
ballistic-to-diffusive transition occurs one decade earlier than for the fluid.
We reveal that both the enhanced dispersion and the early transition to the
diffusive regime can be traced back to the unsteady wake-induced-motions of the
bubbles. Further, the diffusion transition for bubbles is not set by the
integral time scale of the turbulence (as it is for fluid tracers and
microbubbles), but instead, by a timescale of eddy-crossing of the rising
bubbles. The present findings provide a Lagrangian perspective towards
understanding mixing in turbulent bubbly flows.

complexity. While the function of each part is easily understood, higher order
functions are emergent properties and are notoriously difficult to explain. In
networked systems, both digital and biological, each component receives inputs,
performs a simple computation, and creates an output. When these components
have multiple outputs, we intuitively assume that the outputs are causally
dependent on the inputs but are themselves independent of each other given the
state of their shared input. However, this intuition can be violated for
components with probabilistic logic, as these typically cannot be decomposed
into separate logic gates with one output each. This violation of conditional
independence on the past system state is equivalent to instantaneous
interaction --- the idea is that some information between the outputs is not
coming from the inputs and thus must have been created instantaneously. Here we
compare evolved artificial neural systems with and without instantaneous
interaction across several task environments. We show that systems without
instantaneous interactions evolve faster, to higher final levels of
performance, and require fewer logic components to create a densely connected
cognitive machinery.

computational efficiency by substantially reducing model complexity. It is
especially useful for functional data as it implies that the functional

on both small and large scales, and how it relates to the galactic

  We present optical and near UV color-magnitude diagrams for all the galaxies.
For each galaxy we derived the distance from the tip of the red giant branch.
We then used the NUV color-magnitude diagrams to identify stars more massive
than 14 Mo, and compared their number with the number of massive stars expected
from the GALEX FUV luminosity. Our analysis shows that the fraction of massive
stars forming in star clusters and stellar associations is about constant with
the star formation rate. This lack of a relation suggests that the time scale
for evaporation of unbound structures is comparable or longer than 10 Myr. At
low star formation rates this translates to an excess of mass in clustered
environments as compared to model predictions of cluster evolution, suggesting
that a significant fraction of stars form in unbound systems.

  More than 40 years ago, Erd\H{o}s and Kleitman conjectured that an
$s$-saturated family of subsets of $[n]$ has size at least $(1 -
2^{-(s-1)})2^n$. It is easy to show that every $s$-saturated family has size at
least $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 2^n$, but, as was mentioned by Frankl and Tokushige,
even obtaining a slightly better bound of $(1/2 + \varepsilon)2^n$, for some
fixed $\varepsilon > 0$, seems difficult. In this note, we prove such a result,
showing that every $s$-saturated family of subsets of $[n]$ has size at least
$(1 - 1/s)2^n$.
  This lower bound is a consequence of a multipartite version of the problem,
in which we seek a lower bound on $|\mathcal{F}_1| + \ldots + |\mathcal{F}_s|$
where $\mathcal{F}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{F}_s$ are families of subsets of $[n]$,
such that there are no $s$ pairwise disjoint sets, one from each family
$\mathcal{F}_i$, and furthermore no set can be added to any of the families
while preserving this property. We show that $|\mathcal{F}_1| + \ldots +
|\mathcal{F}_s| \ge (s-1)\cdot 2^n$, which is tight e.g.\ by taking
$\mathcal{F}_1$ to be empty, and letting the remaining families be the families
of all subsets of $[n]$.

electromagnetic waves are modeled using the geometrical optics

null geodesics, being equivalent to the motion followed by pointlike spinless
massless particles. It is shown that the redshift for this case depends, in

the second approach electromagnetic waves are studied using the exact form of
Maxwell equations, finding that redshift has dependence on the direction of

dispersive and depend on the anisotropic temporal evolution. In this last case,
redshifts may become dispersive depending on the relative direction between the
light ray propagation vector and the anisotropy axes. The relation of these

developments of modern cosmology that became able to explain many issues of
early universe in the context of the standard cosmological model (SCM).
However, the initial singularity of the universe, where physics is indefinite,
is still obscure in the combined `SCM+inflation' scenario. An alternative to
`SCM+inflation' without the initial singularity is thus always welcome, and
bouncing cosmology is an attempt of that. The current work is thus motivated to
investigate the bouncing solutions in modified gravity theories when the
background universe is described by the spatially flat
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry. We show that the simplest
way to obtain the bouncing cosmologies in such spacetime is to consider some
kind of Lagrangians whose gravitational sector depends only on the square of
the Hubble parameter of the FLRW universe. For these modified Lagrangians, the
corresponding Friedmann equation, a constraint in the dynamics of the universe,
depicts a curve in the phase space $(H,rho)$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter
and $rho$ being the energy density of the universe. As a consequence, a
bouncing cosmology is obtained when this curve is closed and crosses the axis
$H = 0$ at least twice, and whose simplest particular example is the ellipse
depicting the well-known holonomy corrected Friedmann equation in Loop Quantum
Cosmology (LQC). Sometimes, a crucial point in such theories is the appearance
of the Ostrogradski instability at the perturbative level, however, fortunately
enough, in the present work as long as the linear level of perturbations is
concerned, this instability does not appear but such instability may appear at
the higher-order of perturbations.

membrane---the Poisson ratio (PR) $\nu$---is a non-trivial function of the
applied stress $\sigma$ and of the system size $L$, i.e., $\nu=\nu_L(\sigma)$.
We consider a generic 2D membrane embedded into space of dimensionality
$2+d_c$. (The physical situation corresponds to $d_c=1$.) A particularly
important application of our results is free-standing graphene. We find that at
very low stress, where the membrane exhibits a linear response, the PR
$\nu_L(0)$ decreases with increasing $L$ and saturates for $ L\to \infty$ at a
value which depends on the boundary conditions and is essentially different
from the value $\nu=-1/3$ previously predicted by the membrane theory within a
self-consisted scaling analysis. By increasing $\sigma$, one drives a membrane
into a non-linear regime characterized by a universal value of PR that depends
solely on $d_c.$ This universal non-linear PR acquires its minimum value
$\nu_{\rm min}=-1$ in the limit $d_c\to \infty.$ With the further increase of
$\sigma$, the PR changes sign and finally saturates at a positive non-universal
value prescribed by the conventional elasticity theory. We also show that one
should distinguish between the absolute and differential PR ($\nu$ and
$\nu^{\rm diff}$, respectively). While coinciding in the limits of very low and
very high stresses, they differ in general, $\nu \neq \nu^{\rm diff}$. In
particular, in the non-linear universal regime, $\nu^{\rm diff}$ takes a
universal value which, similarly to absolute PR, is a function solely of $d_c$
but is different from the universal value of $\nu$. In the limit $d_c\to
\infty$, the universal value of $\nu^{\rm diff}$ tends to $-1/3$, at variance
with the limiting value $-1$ of $\nu$. Finally, we briefly discuss
generalization of these results to a disordered membrane.

spontaneously broken at $\theta=\pi$, and domain wall solutions connecting the
vacua can be constructed in chiral perturbation theory. In some cases the
breaking of $CP$ saturates an 't Hooft anomaly, and anomaly inflow requires
nontrivial massless excitations on the domain walls. Analogously, $CP$ can be
spontaneously broken in supersymmetric QCD with light flavors and small soft
breaking parameters. We study $CP$ breaking and domain walls in softly broken
SQCD with $N_f<N$ flavors. Relative to ordinary QCD, the supersymmetric case
contains an extra light field, the $\eta^\prime$, which has interesting effects
on the structure of the walls. Vanishing of the $CP$ anomaly is associated with
the existence of multiple domain wall trajectories through field space,
including walls which support no nontrivial massless excitations. In cases with
an anomaly such walls are forbidden, and their absence in the relevant SQCD
theories can be seen directly from the geometry of the low energy field space.
In the case $N_f=N-1$, multiple approximately-BPS walls connect the vacua.
Corrections to their tensions can be computed at leading order in the soft
breaking parameters, producing a phase diagram for the stable wall trajectory.
We also comment on domain walls in the similar case of QCD with an adjoint and
fundamental flavors, and on the impact of adding an axion in this theory.

determined that: i) the exposure to air induced the formation of an InAsO$_4$

air-side InAsO$_4$ and the InAs(QM) is not sharp, indicating that
interdiffusion occurs between these two layers; iii) the bottom interface
between the InAs(QM) and the native oxide SiO$_2$ on top of the (Si/Mo)
substrate is abrupt. In addition, the valence band offset (VBO) between the
InAs(QM) and the SiO$_2$/(Si/Mo) substrate was determined by HXPS. The value of
$VBO = 0.2 \pm 0.04$ eV is in good agreement with literature results obtained
by electrical characterization, giving a clear indication of the formation of a
well-defined and abrupt InAs/SiO$_2$ heterojunction. We have demonstrated that
HXPS and SW-HXPS are non-destructive, powerful methods for characterizing

prove that with these models, the analog combiner design can be done
independently of the pilot sequences. Given the resulting combiner, we derive a
closed-form expression for the optimal pilot sequences in the fully-separable
case and suggest a greedy sum of ratio traces maximization (GSRTM) method for
designing sub-optimal pilots in the partially-separable scenario. We
demonstrate via simulations that our pilot design framework achieves lower mean
squared error than the common pilot allocation framework previously considered
for pilot contamination mitigation.

present here a spatially-resolved stellar populations analysis of a sample of
45 elliptical galaxies (Es) selected from the CALIFA survey. We find rather
flat age and [Mg/Fe] radial gradients, weakly dependent on the effective
velocity dispersion of the galaxy within half-light radius. However, our
analysis shows that metallicity gradients become steeper with increasing galaxy
velocity dispersion. In addition, we have homogeneously compared the stellar
populations gradients of our sample of Es to a sample of nearby relic galaxies,
i.e., local remnants of the high-z population of red nuggets. This comparison
indicates that, first, the cores of present-day massive galaxies were likely
formed in gas-rich, rapid star formation events at high redshift (z>2). This
led to radial metallicity variations steeper than observed in the local
Universe, and positive [Mg/Fe] gradients. Second, our analysis also suggests
that a later sequence of minor dry mergers, populating the outskirts of
early-type galaxies (ETGs), flattened the pristine [Mg/Fe] and metallicity
gradients. Finally, we find a tight age-[Mg/Fe] relation, supporting that the
duration of the star formation is the main driver of the [Mg/Fe] enhancement in
massive ETGs. However, the star formation time-scale alone is not able to fully
explain our [Mg/Fe] measurements. Interestingly, our results match the expected
effect that a variable stellar initial mass function would have on the [Mg/Fe]

Interestingly, we show that the lateral forces on the particle is well
represented using a linearised model across a range of permeate-to-axial flow

permeate flow, which suggests that the interplay between axial and permeate
flow on the lateral force on a particle can be represented as a superposition
between the lateral (inertial) forces in pure axial flow and the viscous forces
in pure permeate flow. We experimentally validate this observation for a range
of flow conditions. The linearised behaviour observed significantly reduces the
complexity and time required to predict the migration of inertial particles in
permeate channels.

combine different statistical measures of membrane structure to identify the

lengths, the hallmark behavior of phase coexistence is the scaling of the
apparent correlation length with system size. Because the latter cannot be
easily varied in simulations, our method instead uses information obtained from
observation windows of different sizes to accurately distinguish phase
coexistence from structured homogeneous phases. This approach is built on very

minimizing both wireless latency and the interference level caused on the

UAVs. To solve this game, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on
echo state network (ESN) cells, is proposed. The introduced deep ESN
architecture is trained to allow each UAV to map each observation of the
network state to an action, with the goal of minimizing a sequence of
time-dependent utility functions. Each UAV uses ESN to learn its optimal path,
transmission power level, and cell association vector at different locations
along its path. The proposed algorithm is shown to reach a subgame perfect Nash
equilibrium (SPNE) upon convergence. Moreover, an upper and lower bound for the
altitude of the UAVs is derived thus reducing the computational complexity of
the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme
achieves better wireless latency per UAV and rate per ground user (UE) while
requiring a number of steps that is comparable to a heuristic baseline that
considers moving via the shortest distance towards the corresponding
destinations. The results also show that the optimal altitude of the UAVs

introducing any \emph{ad hoc} parameters, the bandheads, the rotational

question about the privacy guarantees that can be provided in such a setting.
Our work tackles this problem in the context where a client wishes to classify
private images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained by a server.
Our goal is to build efficient protocols whereby the client can acquire the
classification result without revealing their input to the server, while
guaranteeing the privacy of the server's neural network.
  To this end, we design Gazelle, a scalable and low-latency system for secure
neural network inference, using an intricate combination of homomorphic
encryption and traditional two-party computation techniques (such as garbled
circuits). Gazelle makes three contributions. First, we design the Gazelle
homomorphic encryption library which provides fast algorithms for basic
homomorphic operations such as SIMD (single instruction multiple data)
addition, SIMD multiplication and ciphertext permutation. Second, we implement
the Gazelle homomorphic linear algebra kernels which map neural network layers
to optimized homomorphic matrix-vector multiplication and convolution routines.
Third, we design optimized encryption switching protocols which seamlessly
convert between homomorphic and garbled circuit encodings to enable
implementation of complete neural network inference.
  We evaluate our protocols on benchmark neural networks trained on the MNIST
and CIFAR-10 datasets and show that Gazelle outperforms the best existing
systems such as MiniONN (ACM CCS 2017) by 20 times and Chameleon (Crypto Eprint
2017/1164) by 30 times in online runtime. Similarly when compared with fully
homomorphic approaches like CryptoNets (ICML 2016) we demonstrate three orders

in the atmosphere is lower than predicted. Deviations are, however, less
significant with the post-LHC models. The presence of such deviations seems to
be related to a difference between the simulated and the measured zenith angle
evolutions of the lateral muon density distributions of EAS, which also causes
a discrepancy between the measured absorption lengths of the density of shower
muons and the predicted ones at large distances from the EAS core. The studied
deficiencies show that all four considered hadronic interaction models fail to

redundancy to alleviate the communication bottleneck in distributed graph

structured redundancy in computation phase to enable 'coded' multicasting
opportunities during message exchange between servers, reducing communication
load substantially in large-scale graph processing. For theoretical analysis,
we consider random graph models, and prove that our proposed scheme enables an
(asymptotically) inverse-linear trade-off between 'computation load' and
'average communication load' for two popular random graph models -- Erdos-Renyi
model, and power law model. Particularly, for a given computation load r, (i.e.
when each graph vertex is carefully stored at r servers), the proposed scheme
slashes the average communication load by (nearly) a multiplicative factor of
r. For the Erdos-Renyi model, our proposed scheme is optimal asymptotically as
the graph size increases by providing an information-theoretic converse. To
illustrate the benefits of our scheme in practice, we implement PageRank over
Amazon EC2, using artificial as well as real-world datasets, demonstrating
significant gains over conventional PageRank. We also specialize our scheme and
extend our theoretical results to two other random graph models -- random
bi-partite model, and stochastic block model. They asymptotically enable
inverse-linear trade-offs between computation and communication loads in

complement the achievability results with converse bounds for both of these

object-oriented image classification, which has become relevant due to its
applicability on images with a high spatial resolution. To perform
object-oriented image classification, the studied image must first be segmented
in uniform regions. This segmentation requires manual work by an expert user,
who must exhaustively explore the image to establish thresholds that generate
useful and representative segments without oversegmenting and without
discarding representative segments. We propose a technique that automatically
segments the multispectral image while facing these issues. We identify in the
image homogenous zones according to their spectral signatures through the use
of morphological filters. These homogenous zones are representatives of
different types of land coverings in the image and are used as seeds for the
GrowCut multispectral segmentation algorithm. GrowCut is a cellular automaton
with competitive region growth, its cells are linked to every pixel in the
image through three parameters: the pixel's spectral signature, a label, and a
strength factor that represents the strength with which a cell defends its
label. The seed cells possess maximum strength and maintain their state
throughout the automaton's evolution. Starting from seed cells, each cell in
the image is iteratively attacked by its neighboring cells. When the automaton
stops updating its states, we obtain a segmented image where each pixel has
taken the label of one of its cells. In this paper the algorithm was applied in
an image acquired by Landsat8 on agricultural land of Calabozo, Guarico,
Venezuela where there are different types of land coverings: agriculture, urban
regions, water bodies, and savannas with different degrees of human
intervention. The segmentation obtained is presented as irregular polygons
enclosing geographical objects.

profile of an atmosphere consisting of ideal gases with multiple condensing

and can be generalized to account for chemical reactions. Unlike previous
methods, it converges to machine precision independent of mesh size. It
accounts for any ratio of condensable vapors to dry gas, from zero to infinity,
and for variable heat capacities as a function of temperature. Because the
derivation is generic, the new formula is not only applicable to planetary
atmosphere in the solar system, but also to hot Jupiters and brown dwarfs in
which a variety of alkali metals, silicates and exotic materials condense. We
demonstrate that even though the vapors are ideal gases, they interact in their
effects on the moist adiabatic lapse rate. Finally, we apply the new
thermodynamic model to study the effects of downdrafts on the distribution of
minor constituents and thermal profile in the Galileo probe hotspot. We find

meaningful recommendations to users. One of the proposed approaches is to
consider a recommender system as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem and
try to solve it using reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing RL-based
methods have an obvious drawback. To solve an MDP in a recommender system, they
encountered a problem with the large number of discrete actions that bring RL
to a larger class of problems. In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based
recommender system. We formulate a recommender system as a gridworld game by
using a biclustering technique that can reduce the state and action space
significantly. Using biclustering not only reduces space but also improves the
recommendation quality effectively handling the cold-start problem. In
addition, our approach can provide users with some explanation why the system
recommends certain items. Lastly, we examine the proposed algorithm on a
real-world dataset and achieve a better performance than the widely used
recommendation algorithm.

educational technologies for assisting college-going students in choosing
majors, selecting courses and acquiring feedback based on past academic
performance. Grade prediction methods seek to estimate a grade that a student
may achieve in a course that she may take in the future (e.g., next term).
Accurate and timely prediction of students' academic grades is important for
developing effective degree planners and early warning systems, and ultimately
improving educational outcomes. Existing grade pre- diction methods mostly
focus on modeling the knowledge components associated with each course and
student, and often overlook other factors such as the difficulty of each
knowledge component, course instructors, student interest, capabilities and
effort. In this paper, we propose additive latent effect models that
incorporate these factors to predict the student next-term grades.
Specifically, the proposed models take into account four factors: (i) student's
academic level, (ii) course instructors, (iii) student global latent factor,
and (iv) latent knowledge factors. We compared the new models with several
state-of-the-art methods on students of various characteristics (e.g., whether
a student transferred in or not). The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed methods significantly outperform the baselines on grade prediction

introduce an undirected graph to describe its topological structure. We
establish the equivalence between the graph connectivity and phase
retrievability of FRI signals, and we apply the graph connected component
decomposition to find all FRI signals that have the same magnitude measurements

characterization of metastable austenite is a critical component in accurately
capturing the micro-mechanical behavior under typical application loads.
Traditional mechanical characterization techniques are unable to discretely
quantify the micro-mechanical response of the austenite, and as a result, the
computational predictions rely heavily on trial and error or qualitative
descriptions of the austenite phase. In order to overcome this, in this present
work, we use in-situ neutron diffraction of a uniaxial tension test of an A485
Grade 1 bearing steel specimen. The mechanical response determined from the
neutron diffraction analysis was incorporated into a hybrid crystal plasticity
finite element model that accounts for the martensite's crystal plasticity and
the stress-assisted transformation from austenite to martensite in bearing
steels. The modeling response was used to estimate the single crystal elastic
constants of the austenite and martensite phases. The results show that using
in-situ neutron diffraction coupled with a crystal plasticity model, can
successfully predict both the micro-mechanical and macro-mechanical responses

to address these challenges. In particular we address the issues of source
finding on spatially correlated data, and on images in which the background,
noise, and point spread function, vary across the sky. We also introduce the
concept of forced or priorized fitting.

controllable sampling of diverse images. Fidelity, diversity and controllable
sampling are the main quality measures of a good image generation model. Most
existing models are insufficient in all three aspects. The FusedGAN can perform
controllable sampling of diverse images with very high fidelity. We argue that
controllability can be achieved by disentangling the generation process into
various stages. In contrast to stacked GANs, where multiple stages of GANs are
trained separately with full supervision of labeled intermediate images, the
FusedGAN has a single stage pipeline with a built-in stacking of GANs. Unlike
existing methods, which requires full supervision with paired conditions and
images, the FusedGAN can effectively leverage more abundant images without
corresponding conditions in training, to produce more diverse samples with high
fidelity. We achieve this by fusing two generators: one for unconditional image
generation, and the other for conditional image generation, where the two
partly share a common latent space thereby disentangling the generation. We
demonstrate the efficacy of the FusedGAN in fine grained image generation tasks
such as text-to-image, and attribute-to-face generation.

the magnetic effect on dynamical tide is studied. It is found that magnetic
field has a significant impact not only on the flow structure, i.e. the
internal shear layers in rotating flow can be destroyed in the presence of a
moderate or stronger magnetic field (in the sense that the Alfv\'en velocity is
at least of the order of 0.1 of the surface rotational velocity), but also on
the dispersion relation of waves excited by tidal force such that the range of
tidal resonance is broadened by magnetic field. A major result is that the
total tidal dissipation scales as square of the field strength, which can be
used to estimate the strength of internal magnetic field in the astronomical
object of a binary system. Moreover, with a moderate or stronger field the
ratio of the magnetic dissipation to the viscous dissipation is almost
inversely proportional to magnetic Prandtl number (i.e. the ratio of viscosity
to magnetic diffusivity), and therefore in the astrophysical situation at small
magnetic Prandtl number magnetic dissipation dominates over viscous dissipation
with a moderate or stronger field.

system that can accurately estimate the quantity and quality of sweet pepper

parts: detection, quality estimation, and tracking. Efficient detection is
achieved using the FasterRCNN framework. Quality is then estimated in the same
framework by learning a parallel layer which we show experimentally results in
superior performance than treating quality as extra classes in the traditional
Faster-RCNN framework. Evaluation of these two techniques outlines the improved
performance of the parallel layer, where we achieve an F1 score of 77.3 for the
parallel technique yet only 72.5 for the best scoring (red) of the multi-class
implementation. To track the crop we present a tracking via detection approach,
which uses the FasterRCNN with parallel layers, that is also a vision-only

in experiments across 2 days we show that our proposed system can accurately

densities measured for ordinary and dark matter. We present a comprehensive
theory for ADM that addresses the mass density similarity, going beyond the
usual ADM explanations of similar number densities. It features an explicit
matter-antimatter asymmetry generation mechanism, has one fully worked out
thermal history and suggestions for other possibilities, and meets all
phenomenological, cosmological and astrophysical constraints. Importantly, it
incorporates a deep reason for why the dark matter mass scale is related to the
proton mass, a key consideration in ADM models. Our starting point is the idea
of mirror matter, which offers an explanation for dark matter by duplicating
the standard model with a dark sector related by a $Z_2$ parity symmetry.
However, the dark sector need not manifest as a symmetric copy of the standard
model in the present day. By utilising the mechanism of ""asymmetric symmetry
breaking"" with two Higgs doublets in each sector, we develop a model of ADM
where the mirror symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to an electroweak
scale in the dark sector that is significantly larger than that of the visible
sector. The weak sensitivity of the ordinary and dark QCD confinement scales to
their respective electroweak scales leads to the necessary connection between
the dark matter and proton masses. The dark matter is composed of either dark
neutrons or a mixture of dark neutrons and metastable dark hydrogen atoms.
Lepton asymmetries are generated by the $CP$-violating decays of heavy Majorana
neutrinos in both sectors. These are then converted by sphaleron processes to
produce the observed ratio of visible to dark matter in the universe. The
dynamics responsible for the kinetic decoupling of the two sectors emerges as
an important issue that we only partially solve.

considering the cosmological clustering of the sources. In this short work, we
show that over scales of $k \sim (0.6, 40.) h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, ignoring source
clustering is a valid approximation. This is in contrast to [Murray 2017], who
found a possibility of false detection if the clustering was ignored. The
dominant cause for this change is the introduction of a Galactic synchrotron

that a topological index ${\cal N}_\mathrm{ZES}$ describes the number of

always been an important task in Machine Learning. Recently, Cuturi proposed
the Sinkhorn distance which makes use of an approximate Optimal Transport cost
between two distributions as a distance to describe distribution discrepancy.
Although it has been successfully adopted in various machine learning
applications (e.g. in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision) since
then, the Sinkhorn distance also suffers from two unnegligible limitations. The
first one is that the Sinkhorn distance only gives an approximation of the real
Wasserstein distance, the second one is the `divide by zero' problem which
often occurs during matrix scaling when setting the entropy regularization
coefficient to a small value. In this paper, we introduce a new Brenier
approach for calculating a more accurate Wasserstein distance between two
discrete distributions, this approach successfully avoids the two limitations
shown above for Sinkhorn distance and gives an alternative way for estimating
distribution discrepancy.

triggering it. Here we point out that, according to quantum mechanics, such
interaction-free measurements cannot be perfect, i.e., in a single-shot
experiment one has strictly positive probability to activate the detector. We
formalize the extent to which such measurements are forbidden by deriving a
trade-off relation between the probability of activation and the probability of
an inconclusive interaction-free measurement. Our description of
interaction-free measurements is theory independent and allows derivations of
similar relations in models generalizing quantum mechanics. We provide the
trade-off for the density cube formalism, which extends the quantum model by
permitting coherence between more than two paths. The trade-off obtained hints
at the possibility of perfect interaction-free measurements and indeed we
construct their explicit examples. Such measurements open up a paradoxical
possibility where we can learn by means of interference about the presence of
an object in a given location without ever detecting a probing particle in that
location. We therefore propose that absence of perfect interaction-free
measurement is a natural postulate expected to hold in all physical theories.
As shown, it holds in quantum mechanics and excludes the models with multipath
coherence.

disease, Medical Imaging Devices (MIDs), such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging

today. MIDs are increasingly connected to hospital networks, making them
vulnerable to sophisticated cyber-attacks targeting the devices' infrastructure
and components, which can disrupt digital patient records, and potentially
jeopardize patients' health. Attacks on MIDs are likely to increase, as
attackers' skills improve and the number of unpatched devices with known
vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited grows. Attackers may also block
access to MIDs or disable them, as part of ransomware attacks, which have been
shown to be successful against hospitals. Method and Materials: We conducted a
comprehensive risk analysis survey at the Malware-Lab, based on the
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) model, in collaboration with
our country's largest health maintenance organization, to define the
characteristics of cyber-attacks on MIDs. The survey includes a range of
vulnerabilities and potential attacks aimed at MIDs, medical and imaging
information systems, and medical protocols and standards such as DICOM and HL7.
Results: Based on our survey, we found that CT devices face the greatest risk
of cyber-attack, due to their pivotal role in acute care imaging. Thus, we
identified several possible attack vectors that target the infrastructure and
functionality of CT devices, which can cause: 1. Disruption of the parameters'
values used in the scanning protocols within the CT devices (e.g., tampering
with the radiation exposure levels); 2. Mechanical disruption of the CT device
(e.g., changing the pitch); 3. Disruption of the tomography scan signals
constructing the digital images; and 4. Denial-of-Service attacks against the
CT device.

the fermionic quintuplet. The situation is very different in the MBLSM, which

transition, we analyze the relaxation of an initially prepared imbalance
between the occupation number of odd and of even sites. For quasi-disorder
strength beyond the Anderson localization transition, the imbalance survives
for long times, indicating the inability of the system to reach local
equilibrium. The late time value diminishes for increasing interaction
strength. Close to the critical quasi-disorder strength corresponding to the
noninteracting (Anderson) transition, the interacting system displays an
extremely slow relaxation dynamics, consistent with sub-diffusive behavior. The
amplitude of the imbalance fluctuations around its running average is found to
decrease with time, and such damping is more effective with increasing
interaction strengths. While our study addresses the setup with two equally
intense OLs, very similar effects due to interactions have been observed also

properties thanks to the occurrence of size- and shape-dependent optical
resonance modes. These modes commonly present a spectral overlap of broad,
low-order modes (\textit{e.g}. dipolar modes) and much narrower, higher-order
modes. The latter are usually characterized by a rapidly varying
frequency-dependent phase, which - in superposition with the lower order mode
of approximately constant phase - leads to typical spectral features known as
Fano resonances. Interestingly, such Fano resonances occur in dielectric
nanostructures of the simplest shapes. In spheroidal nanoparticles,
interference between broad magnetic dipole and narrower electric dipole modes
can be observed. In high aspect-ratio structures like nanowires, either the
electric or the magnetic dipolar mode (depending on the illumination
conditions) interferes with higher order multipole contributions of the same
nature (electric or magnetic). Using the analytical Mie theory, we analyze the
occurrence of Fano resonances in high-index dielectric nanowires and discuss
their consequences like unidirectional scattering. By means of numerical
simulations, we furthermore study the impact on those Fano resonances of the
shape of the nanowire cross-sections as well as the coupling of two parallel

relies on virtual coordinates from multiple, alternative anchor point sets that
act as \emph{viewports}. Each viewport offers different address granularity
within the network space, and its selection is optimized by a packet sending
node using a novel heuristic. Regarding routing, each node can deduce whether
it is located on the linear segment connecting the sender to the recipient
node. This deduction is made using integer calculations, node-local information
and in a stateless manner, minimizing the computational and storage overhead of
the proposed scheme. Most importantly, the nodes can regulate the width of the

increased path diversity. This trait can enable future adaptive routing

data-driven services using computational and storage resources close to the end
devices, at the edge of the current network. To achieve higher performance in
this new paradigm one has to consider how to combine the efficiency of resource
usage at all three layers of architecture: end devices, edge devices, and the
cloud. While cloud capacity is elastically extendable, end devices and edge
devices are to various degrees resource-constrained. Hence, an efficient
resource management is essential to make edge computing a reality. In this
work, we first present terminology and architectures to characterize current
works within the field of edge computing. Then, we review a wide range of
recent articles and categorize relevant aspects in terms of 4 perspectives:
resource type, resource management objective, resource location, and resource
use. This taxonomy and the ensuing analysis is used to identify some gaps in
the existing research. Among several research gaps, we found that research is
less prevalent on data, storage, and energy as a resource, and less extensive
towards the estimation, discovery and sharing objectives. As for resource
types, the most well-studied resources are computation and communication
resources. Our analysis shows that resource management at the edge requires a
deeper understanding of how methods applied at different levels and geared
towards different resource types interact. Specifically, the impact of mobility
and collaboration schemes requiring incentives are expected to be different in
edge architectures compared to the classic cloud solutions. Finally, we find
that fewer works are dedicated to the study of non-functional properties or to
quantifying the footprint of resource management techniques, including
edge-specific means of migrating data and services.

$0<\frac{\partial H}{\partial u}\leqslant \lambda$ for some $\lambda>0$, where
$M$ is a connected, closed and smooth manifold. First, we show the uniqueness
of the backward weak KAM solutions of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi

existence of the maximal forward weak KAM solution $u_+$. Next, we analyse
Aubry set for the contact Hamiltonian system showing that it is the
intersection of two Legendrian pseudographs $G_{u_-}$ and $G_{u_+}$, and that
the projection $\pi:T^*M\times \mathbb{R}\to M$ induces a bi-Lipschitz
homeomorphism $\pi|_{\tilde{\mathcal{A}}}$ from Aubry set $\tilde{\mathcal{A}}$
onto the projected Aubry set $\mathcal{A}$. At last, we introduce the notion of
barrier functions and study their interesting properties along calibrated

length diverges at the critical point and the quantum fluctuation of order
parameter behaves as a gapless bosonic mode. Generically, the coupling of this
boson to fermions induces a variety of unusual quantum critical phenomena, such
as non-Fermi liquid behavior and various emergent symmetries. Here, we perform
a renormalization group analysis of the semimetal-superconductor quantum
criticality in a three-dimensional anisotropic Weyl semimetal. Surprisingly,
distinct from previously studied quantum critical systems, the anomalous
dimension of anisotropic Weyl fermions flows to zero very quickly with
decreasing energy, and the quasiparticle residue takes a nonzero value. These
results indicate that, the quantum fluctuation of superconducting order
parameter is irrelevant at low energies, and a simple mean-field calculation
suffices to capture the essential physics of the superconducting transition. We
thus obtain a phase transition that exhibits trivial quantum criticality, which
is unique comparing to other invariably nontrivial quantum critical systems.

amount of configuration knobs. These range from static initialisation
parameters like buffer sizes, degree of concurrency, or level of replication to
complex runtime decisions like creating a secondary index on a particular
column or reorganising the physical layout of the store. To simplify the
configuration, industry grade DBMSs are usually shipped with various advisory
tools, that provide recommendations for given workloads and machines. However,
reality shows that the actual configuration, tuning, and maintenance is usually
still done by a human administrator, relying on intuition and experience.
Recent work on deep reinforcement learning has shown very promising results in
solving problems, that require such a sense of intuition. For instance, it has
been applied very successfully in learning how to play complicated games with
enormous search spaces. Motivated by these achievements, in this work we
explore how deep reinforcement learning can be used to administer a DBMS.

arguments and counter-arguments. To that end, we elaborate a formal framework
aiming to integrate the role of arguments and argumentation in decision theory
and decision aid. We start from a decision situation, where an individual
requests decision support. In this context, we formally define, as a
commendable basis for decision-aid, this individual's deliberated judgment,
popularized by Rawls. We explain how models of deliberated judgment can be
validated empirically. We then identify conditions upon which the existence of
a valid model can be taken for granted, and analyze how these conditions can be
relaxed. We then explore the significance of our proposed framework for
decision aiding practice. We argue that our concept of deliberated judgment
owes its normative credentials both to its normative foundations (the idea of
rationality based on arguments) and to its reference to empirical reality (the
stance that real, empirical individuals hold towards arguments and
counter-arguments, on due reflection). We then highlight that our framework
opens promising avenues for future research involving both philosophical and

distinct from those pertaining to spin $\frac{1}{2}$. The underlying physics
reveals a plethora of positive and negative mirror Chern numbers, respectively
corresponding to chiral and anti-chiral edge states. Here, for simplicity, we

integrals of multiplicities 1 to 4 on the base of the combined approach of
generalized multiple and iterated Fourier series. We consider two different
parts of the expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals. The
mean-square convergence of the first part is proved on the base of generalized
multiple Fourier series that are converge in the sense of norm in Hilbert space
$L_2([t, T]^k),$ $k=1,2,3,4.$ The mean-square convergence of the second part is
proved on the base of generalized iterated Fourier series that are converge
pointwise. At that, we do not use the iterated Ito stochastic integrals as a
tool of the proof and directly consider the iterated Stratonovich stochastic
integrals. The cases of multiple Fourier-Legendre series and multiple
trigonometric Fourier series are considered in detail. The considered
expansions contain only one operation of the limit transition in contrast to
its existing analogues. This property is very important for the mean-square
approximation of iterated stochastic integrals. The results of the article can
be applied to the numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential
equations.

The amplification arises from the mechanical gain, which provides an effective
phonon bath that pumps the mechanical mode coherently. This effect is analogous
to the stimulated emission of atoms, where the probe field can be amplified
when its frequency is in resonance with that of the anti-Stokes transition. We
show that by choosing optimal parameters, this optomechanical transistor can

tractable. The survival probability has to be known in closed form (for
calibration purposes), the model should be able to fit any valid Credit Default
Swap (CDS) curve, should lead to large volatilities (in line with CDS options)
and finally should be able to feature significant Wrong-Way Risk (WWR) impact.
The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model (CIR) combined with independent positive jumps and
deterministic shift (JCIR++) is a very good candidate : the variance (and thus
covariance with exposure, i.e. WWR) can be increased with the jumps, whereas
the calibration constraint is achieved via the shift. In practice however,
there is a strong limit on the model parameters that can be chosen, and thus on
the resulting WWR impact. This is because only non-negative shifts are allowed
for consistency reasons, whereas the upwards jumps of the JCIR++ need to be
compensated by a downward shift. To limit this problem, we consider the
two-side jump model recently introduced by Mendoza-Arriaga \& Linetsky, built
by time-changing CIR intensities. In a multivariate setup like CVA,
time-changing the intensity partly kills the potential correlation with the
exposure process and destroys WWR impact. Moreover, it can introduce a forward
looking effect that can lead to arbitrage opportunities. In this paper, we use
the time-changed CIR process in a way that the above issues are avoided. We
show that the resulting process allows to introduce a large WWR effect compared
to the JCIR++ model. The computation cost of the resulting Monte Carlo
framework is reduced by using an adaptive control variate procedure.

emergence of large scale face databases, face recognition has achieved a great
success in recent years. During the training process of DNN, the face features
and classification vectors to be learned will interact with each other, while
the distribution of face features will largely affect the convergence status of
network and the face similarity computing in test stage. In this work, we
formulate jointly the learning of face features and classification vectors, and
propose a simple yet effective centralized coordinate learning (CCL) method,
which enforces the features to be dispersedly spanned in the coordinate space
while ensuring the classification vectors to lie on a hypersphere. An adaptive
angular margin is further proposed to enhance the discrimination capability of
face features. Extensive experiments are conducted on six face benchmarks,
including those have large age gap and hard negative samples. Trained only on
the small-scale CASIA Webface dataset with 460K face images from about 10K

star. The lifetime of this compact remnant depends on the total mass and the
equation of state. The collapse of this compact remnant to a black- hole-torus
system is expected to give rise to a powerful jet and a short gamma-ray burst.
Nevertheless, if the collapse is delayed half a second or so, the surrounding
matter would be already accreted and/or expelled and hence no torus will be
formed. However, the collapse itself will give rise to a quasi-isotropic
magnetized fireball. This magnetic bomb will dissipate much of its energy due
to magnetic re-connection and will produce the prompt emission, when the
fireball will become transparent to gamma-rays. The energy range of such an
explosion depends on the initial magnetic field strength of the two neutron
stars and the amplification of the magnetic energy during merger. We discuss
the production of a quasi-isotropic magnetized fireball and its subsequent
interaction with the ejected matter during merger, as the outcome of the
coalescence of a binary neutron star system. We further discuss a possible
origin for the duration of the burst and the radial stratification of the flow
following the quasi-normal modes of the black hole.

Numerous image-domain correction algorithms have been proposed in the
literature that use patient-specific planning CT images to estimate shading
contributions in CBCT images. However, in the context of radiosurgery
applications such as gamma knife, planning images are often acquired through
MRI which impedes the use of polynomial fitting approaches for shading
correction. We present a new shading correction approach that is independent of
planning CT images. Our algorithm is based on the assumption that true CBCT
images follow a uniform volumetric intensity distribution per material, and
scatter perturbs this uniform texture by contributing cupping and shading
artifacts in the image domain. The framework is a combination of fuzzy C-means
coupled with a neighborhood regularization term and Otsu's method. Experimental
results on artificially simulated craniofacial CBCT images are provided to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. Spatial non-uniformity is
reduced from 16% to 7% in soft tissue and from 44% to 8% in bone regions. With
shading-correction, thresholding based segmentation accuracy for bone pixels is
improved from 85% to 91% when compared to thresholding without
shading-correction. The proposed algorithm is thus practical and qualifies as a
plug and play extension into any CBCT reconstruction software for shading
correction.

the rate at which it can transmit information through the neural network. The
particular transmission model under consideration allows for information to be
transmitted along multiple paths between points of the cortex. The resulting
transmission rates are governed by potential theory. According to this theory,
the brain has preferred and quantized transmission modes that correspond to
eigenfunctions of the classical Steklov eigenvalue problem, with the reciprocal
eigenvalues quantifying the corresponding transmission rates. We take the model
as a basis for testing the hypothesis that the sulcus pattern of the human
brain has evolved to maximize the rate of transmission of information between
points in the cerebral cortex. We show that the introduction of sulci, or cuts,
in an otherwise smooth domain indeed increases the overall transmission rate.
We demonstrate this result by means of numerical experiments concerned with a
spherical domain with a varying number of slits on its surface.

the final signal of a magnetized neutron star collapsing to a black hole. In
this model, a supramassive neutron star supported by rapid rotation, will
collapse to a black hole several thousand to million years after its birth as a
result of spin down. The collapse violently snaps the magnetic-field lines
anchored on the stellar surface, thus producing an electromagnetic pulse that
will propagate outwards and accelerate electrons producing a massive radio
burst, i.e. a ""blitzar"". We present a systematic study of the gravitational
collapse of rotating and magnetised neutron stars with special attention to
far-field evolution at late times after the collapse. By considering a series
of neutron stars with rotation ranging from zero to millisecond periods and
different magnetic-field strengths, we show that the blitzar emission is very
robust and always characterised by a series sub-millisecond pulses decaying
exponentially in amplitude. The luminosity and energy released when the
magnetosphere is destroyed are well reproduced by a simple expression in terms
of the stellar magnetic field and radius. Finally, we assess the occurrence of
pair production during a blitzar scenario, concluding that for typical
magnetic-field strengths of $10^{12}\,{\rm G}$ and spin frequencies of a few
Hz, pair production is suppressed. Overall, the very good match between the
results of the simulations and the luminosities normally observed for FRBs
lends credibility to the blitzar model as a simple and yet plausible
explanation for the phenomenology of non-repeating FRBs.

nodal-line semimetals. However, different experiments have reported
contradictory phase shifts, in particular, in the WHM nodal-line semimetals

present a systematic calculation for the SdH oscillation of resistivity under a

the resistivity, we extract general rules to determine the phase shifts for
arbitrary cases and apply them to ZrSiS and Cu$_3$PdN systems. Depending on the

only 3.4\% of the Earth's surface. Although two events hardly constitute a
statistically significant demonstration of a geographical pattern of impacts,
their spatial coincidence is at least tantalizing. To understand if this
concurrence reflects an underlying geographical and/or temporal pattern, we
must aim at predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of meteoroid impacts on
Earth. For this purpose we designed, implemented and tested a novel numerical
technique, the ""Gravitational Ray Tracing"" (GRT) designed to compute the
relative impact probability (RIP) on the surface of any planet. GRT is inspired
by the so-called ray-casting techniques used to render realistic images of
complex 3D scenes. In this paper we describe the method and the results of
testing it at the time of large impact events. Our findings suggest a
non-trivial pattern of impact probabilities at any given time on Earth.
Locations at $60-90\deg$ from the apex are more prone to impacts, especially at
midnight. Counterintuitively, sites close to apex direction have the lowest
RIP, while in the antapex RIP are slightly larger than average. We present here
preliminary maps of RIP at the time of Tunguska and Chelyabinsk events and
found no evidence of a spatial or temporal pattern, suggesting that their
coincidence was fortuitous. We apply the GRT method to compute theoretical RIP
at the location and time of 394 large fireballs. Although the predicted
spatio-temporal impact distribution matches marginally the observed events, we
successfully predict their impact speed distribution.

pulsars to investigate the likelihood of resolving individual $\dot{\nu}$
transitions. We inject step-changes in the value of $\dot{\nu}$ with a wide
range of amplitudes and switching timescales. We then attempt to redetect these

precision and the observing cadence are varied. Limits on $\dot{\nu}$
detectability based on the effects such transitions have on the timing

current timing programs, we find we are insensitive to a large region of
$\Delta \dot{\nu}$ parameter space which encompasses small, short timescale
switches. We find, where the rotation and emission states are correlated, that
using changes to the pulse shape to estimate $\dot{\nu}$ transition epochs, can
improve detectability in certain scenarios. The effects of cadence on $\Delta

relationships are derived between the traditional parameters current gain

shown that $\beta$ tends to increase with $s$ for fixed $V_a$, while $R_o$
depends only on $V_a$, varying linearly with this parameter. Several
interesting results are obtained with respect to 7 pairs of complementary BJTs,
each represented by 10 samples. First, we have that the considered BJTs occupy
a restricted band along the Early parameter space, and also that the NPN and
PNP groups are mostly segregated into two respective regions in this space. In
addition, PNP devices tended to present an intrinsically larger parameter
variation. The NPN group tended to have higher $V_a$ magnitude and smaller $s$
than PNP devices. NPN transistors yielded comparable $\beta$ and larger $R_o$

$N_{\rm coll}$ or $N_{\rm qp}$ which reduces binomially as the A$+$A collisions
become more central. If this is not correctly accounted for in projections of
A$+$A to p$+$p collisions, then mistaken conclusions can result. A recent
example is presented in whether the mid-rapidity charged multiplicity per
constituent quark participant $({dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta})/{N_{\rm qp}}$ in Au$+$Au
at RHIC was the same as the value in p$+$p collisions.

to its potential for realizing digital circuits and systems with low power
dissipation, less critical path delay, and less area occupancy for an
acceptable trade-off in the accuracy of results. In the domain of computer
arithmetic, several approximate adders and multipliers have been designed and
their potential have been showcased versus accurate adders and multipliers for
practical digital signal processing applications. Nevertheless, in the existing
literature, almost all the approximate adders and multipliers reported
correspond to the synchronous design method. In this work, we consider robust
asynchronous i.e. quasi-delay-insensitive realizations of approximate adders by
employing delay-insensitive codes for data representation and processing, and
the 4-phase handshake protocols for data communication. The 4-phase handshake
protocols used are the return-to-zero and the return-to-one protocols.
Specifically, we consider the implementations of 32-bit approximate adders
based on the return-to-zero and return-to-one handshake protocols by adopting
the delay-insensitive dual-rail code for data encoding. We consider a range of
approximations varying from 4-bits to 20-bits for the least significant
positions of the accurate 32-bit asynchronous adder. The asynchronous adders
correspond to early output (i.e. early reset) type, which are based on the
well-known ripple carry adder architecture. The experimental results show that
approximate asynchronous adders achieve reductions in the design metrics such
as latency, cycle time, average power dissipation, and silicon area compared to
the accurate asynchronous adders. Further, the reductions in the design metrics
are greater for the return-to-one protocol compared to the return-to-zero

The author's main idea was the natural inclusion of Kolmogorov's axiomatics of
probability theory in a number of general concepts of the theory of experience
and chance. The analogy between the measure of a set and the probability of an
event has become clear for a long time. This analogy also allows further
evolution: the measure of a set is completely analogous to the believability of
an event. In order to postulate the theory of experience and chance on the
basis of this analogy, you just need to add to the Kolmogorov probability
theory its dual reflection - the believability theory, so that the theory of
experience and chance could be postulated as the certainty
(believability-probability) theory on the Cartesian product of the probability
and believability spaces, and the central concept of the theory is the new
notion of co~event as a measurable binary relation on the Cartesian product of
sets of elementary incomes and elementary outcomes. Attempts to build the
foundations of the theory of experience and chance from this general point of
view are unknown to me, and the whole range of ideas presented here has not yet
acquired popularity even in a narrow circle of specialists; in addition, there
was still no complete system of the postulates of the theory of experience and
chance free from unnecessary complications. The main result of this work is the
axiom of co~event, intended for the sake of constructing a theory formed by
dual theories of believabilities and probabilities, each of which itself is
postulated by its own Kolmogorov system of axioms. Here a preference is given
to a system of postulates that is able to describe in a simple manner the
results of what I call an experienced-random experiment.

metal-dielectric (hybrid) nanostructures demonstrated many superior properties
from the point of view of practical application, including moderate dissipative
losses, resonant optical magnetic response, strong nonlinear optical
properties, which made the development in this field the vanguard of the modern
light science. This review is devoted to the current state of theoretical and
experimental studies of hybrid metal-dielectric nanoantennas and nanostructures
based on them, capable of selective scattering light waves, amplifying and
transmitting optical signals in the desired direction, controlling the
propagation of such signals, and generating optical harmonics.

archi-tectures have broken records in the past few years, but recent state of
the art models have also incurred very high computational cost in terms of
training, inference and model size. Making the deployment of these models on
Edge devices, impractical. In light of this, we present a new novel
architecture that is designed for high computational efficiency on both GPUs
and CPUs, and is highly suited for deployment on Mobile Applications, Smart
Cameras, Iot devices and controllers as well as low cost drones. Our
architecture boasts competitive accuracies on standard Datasets even
out-performing the original Resnet. We present below the motivation for this
research, the architecture of the network, single test accuracies on CIFAR 10
and CIFAR 100 , a detailed comparison with other well-known architectures and
link to an implementation in Keras.

properties of these fractures are controlled by its compliance or stiffness.
Characterizing fracture compliance and conductivity is crucial in applications
such as fault zone studies, underground CO2 sequestration, nuclear waste
repositories, geothermal energy exploitation and hydrocarbon reservoir
development. In this study, we present a time convolution solution of pressure
transient behavior of a closing fracture. From Diagnostic Fracture Injection
Tests, our presented method can be used to estimate subsurface fracture
conductivity and compliance as a function of effective stress.
