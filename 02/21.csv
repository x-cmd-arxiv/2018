  experimental test",,,,,"cs.CL physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The words of a language are randomly replaced in time by new ones, but it has
long been known that words corresponding to some items (meanings) are less
frequently replaced than others. Usually, the rate of replacement for a given
item is not directly observable, but it is inferred by the estimated stability
which, on the contrary, is observable. This idea goes back a long way in the
lexicostatistical literature, nevertheless nothing ensures that it gives the
correct answer. The family of Romance languages allows for a direct test of the
estimated stabilities against the replacement rates since the proto-language
(Latin) is known and the replacement rates can be explicitly computed. The
output of the test is threefold:first, we prove that the standard approach
which tries to infer the replacement rates trough the estimated stabilities is
sound; second, we are able to rewrite the fundamental formula of
Glottochronology for a non universal replacement rate (a rate which depends on
the item); third, we give indisputable evidence that the stability ranking is
far from being the same for different families of languages. This last result
is also supported by comparison with the Malagasy family of dialects. As a side
result we also provide some evidence that Vulgar Latin and not Late Classical
Latin is at the root of modern Romance languages.

regulation of many important intracellular processes in procaryotes,
eucaryotes, and multicellular organisms. The emergence of patterns generated by
interactions of diffusing proteins is a paradigmatic example for
self-organization. In this article we review quantitative models for
intracellular Min protein patterns in E. coli, Cdc42 polarization in S.
cerevisiae, and the bipolar PAR protein patterns found in C. elegans. By
analyzing the molecular processes driving these systems we derive a theoretical
perspective on general principles underlying self-organized pattern formation.
We argue that intracellular pattern formation is not captured by concepts such
as ""activators""', ""inhibitors"", or ""substrate-depletion"". Instead,
intracellular pattern formation is based on the redistribution of proteins by
cytosolic diffusion, and the cycling of proteins between distinct
conformational states. Therefore, mass-conserving reaction-diffusion equations
provide the most appropriate framework to study intracellular pattern
formation. We conclude that directed transport, e.g. cytosolic diffusion along
an actively maintained cytosolic gradient, is the key process underlying
pattern formation. Thus the basic principle of self-organization is the
establishment and maintenance of directed transport by intracellular protein
dynamics.

networks. A graph $G=(V,E)$ is called an $(\alpha_w, \beta_w)$-{wireless
expander} if for every subset $S \subseteq V$ s.t. $|S|\leq \alpha_w \cdot
|V|$, there exists a subset $S'\subseteq S$ s.t. there are at least $\beta_w
\cdot |S|$ vertices in $V\backslash S$ adjacent in $G$ to exactly one vertex in
$S'$. The main question we ask is the following: to what extent are ordinary
expanders also good {wireless} expanders? We answer this question in a nearly
tight manner. On the positive side, we show that any $(\alpha, \beta)$-expander
with maximum degree $\Delta$ and $\beta\geq 1/\Delta$ is also a $(\alpha_w,
\beta_w)$ wireless expander for $\beta_w = \Omega(\beta / \log (2 \cdot
\min\{\Delta / \beta, \Delta \cdot \beta\}))$. Thus the wireless expansion is
smaller than the ordinary expansion by at most a factor logarithmic in
$\min\{\Delta / \beta, \Delta \cdot \beta\}$, which depends on the graph
\emph{average degree} rather than maximum degree; e.g., for low arboricity
graphs, the wireless expansion matches the ordinary expansion up to a constant.
We complement this positive result by presenting an explicit construction of a
""bad"" $(\alpha, \beta)$-expander for which the wireless expansion is $\beta_w =
O(\beta / \log (2 \cdot \min\{\Delta / \beta, \Delta \cdot \beta\})$.
  We also analyze the theoretical properties of wireless expanders and their
connection to unique neighbor expanders, and demonstrate their applicability:
Our results yield improved bounds for the {spokesmen election problem} that was
introduced in the seminal paper of Chlamtac and Weinstein (1991) to devise
efficient broadcasting for multihop radio networks. Our negative result yields
a significantly simpler proof than that from the seminal paper of Kushilevitz
and Mansour (1998) for a lower bound on the broadcast time in radio networks.

  Differential-Drive Mobile Robots","ICRA 2018",,,,"cs.RO cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When designing control strategies for differential-drive mobile robots, one
standard tool is the consideration of a point at a fixed distance along a line
orthogonal to the wheel axis instead of the full pose of the vehicle. This
abstraction supports replacing the non-holonomic, three-state unicycle model
with a much simpler two-state single-integrator model (i.e., a
velocity-controlled point). Yet this transformation comes at a performance
cost, through the robot's precision and maneuverability. This work contains
derivations for expressions of these precision and maneuverability costs in
terms of the transformation's parameters. Furthermore, these costs show that
only selecting the parameter once over the course of an application may cause
an undue loss of precision. Model Predictive Control (MPC) represents one such
method to ameliorate this condition. However, MPC typically realizes a control
signal, rather than a parameter, so this work also proposes a Parametric Model
Predictive Control (PMPC) method for parameter and sampling horizon
optimization. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the effects
of the parameterization on the deployment of algorithms developed for the
single-integrator model on actual differential-drive mobile robots.

  vertebrates through ancient genome reconstructions",,,,,"q-bio.PE q-bio.GN","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The famous 2R hypothesis was first proposed by Susumu Ohno in 1970. It states
that the two whole genome duplications had shaped the genome of early
vertebrates. The most convincing evidence for 2R hypothesis comes from the 4:1
ratio chromosomal regions that have preserved both gene content and order in
vertebrates compared with closely related. However, due to the shortage of such
strict evidence, the 2R hypothesis is still under debates.
  Here, we present a combined perspective of phylogenetic and genomic homology
to revisit the hypothesis of 2R whole genome duplications. Ancestral vertebrate
genomes as well as ancient duplication events were created from 17 extant
vertebrate species. Extant descendants from the duplication events at early
vertebrates were extracted and reorganized to partial genomes. We then examined
the gene order based synteny, and projected back to phylogenetic gene trees for
examination of synteny evidence of the reconstructed early vertebrate genes. We
identified 7877 ancestral genes that were created from 3026 duplication events
at early vertebrates, and more than 50% of the duplication events show synteny
evidence. Thus, our reconstructions provide very strong evidence for the 2R
hypothesis.
  We also reconstructed the genome of early vertebrates, and built a model of
the gene gains and losses in early vertebrates. We estimated that there were
about 12,000 genes in early vertebrates before 2R, and the probability of a
random gene get lost after the first round of whole genome duplication is
around 0.45, and the probability of a random gene get lost after the second
round of whole genome duplication is around 0.55.
  This research provides convincing evidence for the 2R hypothesis, and may
provide further insights in vertebral evolution.

algorithm that learns a low-dimensional decomposition of the pipelines
high-dimensional hyperparameter space in concurrence with the BO procedure.
This is achieved by modeling the pipelines performances as a black-box function

pipelines baseline algorithms via a sparse additive kernel with a Dirichlet
prior. Meta-learning is used to warmstart BO with external data from similar
patient cohorts by calibrating the priors using an algorithm that mimics the

presenting the clinicians with logical association rules that link patients

networks with restricted bandwidth that has been very intensively studied
recently. It models a network by an $n$-vertex graph in which any pair of
vertices can communicate one with another by transmitting $O(\log n )$ bits in
each round. Various problems have been studied in this setting, but for some of
them the best-known results are those for general networks. In this paper we
devise significantly improved algorithms for various symmetry-breaking
problems, such as forests-decompositions, vertex-colorings, and maximal
independent set.
  We analyze the running time of our algorithms as a function of the arboricity
$a$ of a clique subgraph that is given as input. Our algorithms are especially
efficient in Trees, planar graphs, graphs with constant genus, and many other
graphs that have bounded arboricity, but unbounded size. We obtain
$O(a)$-forest-decomposition algorithm with $O(\log a)$ time that improves the
previously-known $O(\log n)$ time, $O(a^{2 + \epsilon})$-coloring in $O(\log^*
n)$ time that improves upon an $O(\log n)$-time algorithm, $O(a)$-coloring in
$O(a^{\epsilon})$-time that improves upon several previous algorithms, and a
maximal independent set algorithm with $O(\sqrt a)$ time that improves at least
quadratically upon the state-of-the-art for small and moderate values of $a$.
  Those results are achieved using several techniques. First, we produce a
forest decomposition with a helpful structure called {$H$-partition} within
$O(\log a)$ rounds. In general graphs this structure requires $\Theta(\log n)$
time, but in Congested Cliques we are able to compute it faster. We employ this
structure in conjunction with partitioning techniques that allow us to solve
various symmetry-breaking problems efficiently.

designed structures can host topologically protected edge modes, and validate
the numerical predictions through explicit 3D finite element simulations of

soon, we are entering an exciting phase during which we expect an order of
magnitude improvement in constraints on dark energy and the physics of the
accelerating Universe. This is a key moment for a matching Small Projects
portfolio that can (1) greatly enhance the science reach of these flagship
projects, (2) have immediate scientific impact, and (3) lay the groundwork for
the next stages of the Cosmic Frontier Dark Energy program. In this White
Paper, we outline a balanced portfolio that can accomplish these goals through
a combination of observational, experimental, and theory and simulation
efforts.

expanding range of devices, from top-down structures to appealing bottom-up
MoS$_2$ and graphene membranes, used for both sensing and component-oriented
applications. One of the main concerns in all of these devices is frequency
noise, which ultimately limits their applicability. This issue has attracted a
lot of attention recently, and the origin of this noise remains elusive up to
date. In this Letter we present a very simple technique to measure frequency
noise in nonlinear mechanical devices, based on the presence of bistability. It
is illustrated on silicon-nitride high-stress doubly-clamped beams, in a
cryogenic environment. We report on the same $T/f$ dependence of the frequency
noise power spectra as reported in the literature. But we also find unexpected
{\it damping fluctuations}, amplified in the vicinity of the bifurcation
points; this effect is clearly distinct from already reported nonlinear
dephasing, and poses a fundamental limit on the measurement of bifurcation
frequencies. The technique is further applied to the measurement of frequency
noise as a function of mode number, within the same device. The relative
frequency noise for the fundamental flexure $\delta f/f_0$ lies in the range
$0.5 - 0.01~$ppm (consistent with literature for cryogenic MHz devices), and
decreases with mode number in the range studied. The technique can be applied
to {\it any types} of nano-mechanical structures, enabling progresses towards
the understanding of intrinsic sources of noise in these devices.

National Airspace System (NAS) is a complex problem which is required to be
addressed by simulation studies before allowing the routine access of UAS into
the NAS. This paper focuses on providing a 3-dimensional (3D) simulation
framework using a game theoretical methodology to evaluate integration concepts
using scenarios where manned and unmanned air vehicles co-exist. In the
proposed method, human pilot interactive decision making process is
incorporated into airspace models which can fill the gap in the literature
where the pilot behavior is generally assumed to be known a priori. The
proposed human pilot behavior is modeled using dynamic level-k reasoning
concept and approximate reinforcement learning. The level-k reasoning concept
is a notion in game theory and is based on the assumption that humans have
various levels of decision making. In the conventional ""static"" approach, each
agent makes assumptions about his or her opponents and chooses his or her
actions accordingly. On the other hand, in the dynamic level-k reasoning,
agents can update their beliefs about their opponents and revise their level-k
rule. In this study, Neural Fitted Q Iteration, which is an approximate
reinforcement learning method, is used to model time-extended decisions of
pilots with 3D maneuvers. An analysis of UAS integration is conducted using an
example 3D scenario in the presence of manned aircraft and fully autonomous UAS
equipped with sense and avoid algorithms.

of this class---such as FeSi and FeSb$_2$---display an unusual temperature
dependence in various observables: insulating with large thermopowers at low
temperatures, they turn bad metals at temperatures much smaller than the size
of their gaps. This insulator-to-metal crossover is accompanied by spectral
weight-transfers over large energies in the optical conductivity and by a
gradual transition from activated to Curie-Weiss-like behaviour in the magnetic
susceptibility. We show a retrospective of the understanding of these
phenomena, discuss the relation to heavy-fermion Kondo insulators---such as
Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pt$_3$ for which we present new results---and propose a general
classification of paramagnetic insulators. From the latter FeSi emerges as an
orbital-selective Kondo insulator. Focussing on intermetallics such as
silicides, antimonides, skutterudites, and Heusler compounds we showcase
successes and challenges for the realistic simulation of transport properties
in the presence of electronic correlations. Further, we advert to new avenues

the leading order tail asymptotics of the distribution of the first hitting

  In the present article we condition stable processes to avoid intervals. The
required tail asymptotics in the stable setting for $\alpha\geq 1$ go back to
classical work of Blumenthal et al. and Port from the 1960s. For $\alpha<1$, we
appeal to recent results centred around the so-called deep factorisation of the
stable process to compute hitting probabilities and, moreover, to identify the
associated harmonic functions for all $\alpha\in (0,2)$. With these in hand, we
thus prove that conditioning to avoid an interval is possible in the classical

process killed on entering the aforesaid interval. Appealing to the
representation of the conditioned process as a Doob $h$-transform, we verify
that the conditioned process is transient.

accelerator. Predicting and reducing the surface dissipation in RF is
mandatory, since it has a tremendous cost impact on most of the large
accelerator projects. The theoretical approach of superconducting
radiofrequency (SRF) behavior has been far less explored than DC behavior and
is still based on the description of relatively simple systems, quite remote
from the realistic material in use. Nevertheless, because the actual
crystalline substructure is not taken into account, it is still difficult to
predict surface dissipation accurately. Moreover, Niobium with its large lambda
(~40 nm), exhibit an original behavior compared to the usual superconductors
used in applied superconductivity, and generalities (e.g. pinning at grain
boundaries) needs to be reconsidered. In this paper we hope to demonstrate that
sources of dissipation usually attributed to external causes (mainly flux
trapping during cooldown and hydrides precipitates) are related to the same
type of crystalline defects which are not grain boundaries; that they affect
the local superconducting properties and can also be at the source of early
vortex penetration at the surface. We want also to stretch out how those
defects can explain some of the discrepancies observed from lab to lab on
recent results obtained i.e. in doping experiments. Understanding the origin
and the role of these defects could provide indications for updating
specification as well as fabrication follow up. Rather than new results the
author wishes to present to the superconducting accelerators community the
synthesis of multiple experimental results scattered in the literature that
provide a new lighting on recently published work, in particular in the domain
of SRF cavity doping as well as issues such as sensitivity to trapped flux
during cooldown.

of the current exploration methods for deep RL use task-agnostic objectives,
such as information gain or bonuses based on state visitation. However, many
practical applications of RL involve learning more than a single task, and
prior tasks can be used to inform how exploration should be performed in new
tasks. In this work, we explore how prior tasks can inform an agent about how
to explore effectively in new situations. We introduce a novel gradient-based
fast adaptation algorithm -- model agnostic exploration with structured noise
(MAESN) -- to learn exploration strategies from prior experience. The prior
experience is used both to initialize a policy and to acquire a latent
exploration space that can inject structured stochasticity into a policy,
producing exploration strategies that are informed by prior knowledge and are
more effective than random action-space noise. We show that MAESN is more
effective at learning exploration strategies when compared to prior meta-RL
methods, RL without learned exploration strategies, and task-agnostic
exploration methods. We evaluate our method on a variety of simulated tasks:
locomotion with a wheeled robot, locomotion with a quadrupedal walker, and

combination with a number of distinct detection approaches. The coordinates of
an individual electron spin can then in principle be determined by introducing
a 10 to 100 nm diameter magnetic needle, scanning the needle, and collecting
signal as a function of the needle's position. Although individual electrons
have recently been localized with nanometer precision in this way using a
nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as the spin detector, the experiment's low
signal-to-noise ratio limited acquisition to two-dimensional scanning of just a
few dozen data points and was incompatible with nitroxide spin labels widely
used to label proteins and nucleic acids. We introduce and numerically simulate
a protocol for detecting and imaging individual nitroxide electron spins
mechanically with high spatial resolution. In our protocol a scanned
magnet-tipped cantilever is brought near the sample, modulated microwaves are
applied to resonantly excite electron spins, and changes in spin magnetization
are detected as a shift in the mechanical frequency of the cantilever. By
carefully applying resonant microwaves in short bursts in synchrony with the
cantilever's oscillation, we propose to retain high spatial resolution even at
large cantilever amplitude where sensitivity is highest. Numerical simulations
reveal nanometer-diameter rings of frequency-shift signal as the tip is
scanned. Our primary finding is that it is possible --- using a Bayesian,
reverse Monte Carlo algorithm introduced here --- to obtain the full
three-dimensional distribution of electron coordinates from the signal rings
revealed in a two-dimensional frequency-shift map. This reduction in
dimensionality brings within reach, on a practical timescale, the

decoupling between robustness and adaption owing to the introduction of a low
pass filter with adjustable gain in the feedback loop. The trade-off between
performance, fast adaptation and robustness, is the main criteria when
selecting the structure or the coefficients of the filter. Several off-line
methods with varying levels of complexity exist to help finding bounds or
initial values for these coefficients. Such values may require further

these approaches suggest that once implemented these values are kept fixed

In this paper, a new practical approach based on fuzzy rules for online
continuous tuning of these coefficients is proposed. The fuzzy controller is
optimally tuned using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) taking into accounts
both the tracking error and the controller output signal range. The simulation

coherence lengths in such materials. We especially focus on the consequences of
the soft modes stemming from the frustration and time-reversal-symmetry
breakdown. We find that two-bands superconductors with such impurity-induced
frustrated interactions display a rich spectrum of physical properties that are
absent in their clean counterparts. It features a mixing of Leggett's and
Anderson-Higgs modes, and a soft mode with diverging coherence length at the
impurity-induced second order phase transition from $s_{\pm}/s_{++}$ states to
the $s+is$ state. Such a soft mode generically results in long-range attractive
intervortex forces that can trigger the formation of vortex clusters. We find
that, if such clusters are formed, their size and internal flux density have a
characteristic temperature dependence that could be probed in
muon-spin-rotation experiments. We also comment on the appearance of
spontaneous magnetic fields due to spatially varying impurities.

optical/near-infrared photometric data from the \textit{Carnegie Supernovae
Project-I}. We analyse four colours ($B-V$, $u-g$, $g-r$, and $g-Y$) and find
that SN~II colour curves can be described by two linear regimes during the
photospheric phase. The first ($s_{\rm 1,colour}$) is steeper and has a median
duration of $\sim 40$ days. The second, shallower slope ($s_{\rm 2,colour}$)
lasts until the end of the ""plateau"" ($\sim 80$ days). The two slopes correlate
in the sense that steeper initial colour curves also imply steeper colour
curves at later phases. As suggested by recent studies, SNe~II form a
continuous population of objects from the colour point of view as well. We
investigate correlations between the observed colours and a range of
photometric and spectroscopic parameters including the absolute magnitude, the
$V$-band light-curve slopes, and metal-line strengths. We find that less
luminous SNe~II appear redder, a trend that we argue is not driven by
uncorrected host-galaxy reddening. While there is significant dispersion, we
find evidence that redder SNe~II (mainly at early epochs) display stronger
metal-line equivalent widths. Host-galaxy reddening does not appear to be a
dominant parameter, neither driving observed trends nor dominating the
dispersion in observed colours. Intrinsic SN~II colours are most probably
dominated by photospheric temperature differences, with progenitor metallicity
possibly playing a minor role. Such temperature differences could be related to
differences in progenitor radius, together with the presence or absence of
circumstellar material close to the progenitor stars.

of ram pressure stripping combined with thermally driven, local outflows from

mass, but higher inertia gas will lengthen the timescale for this gas to be

investigate the combined effect of gas angular momentum and radiation feedback
on the accretion flow, by performing 2D axially symmetric radiation
hydrodynamics simulations that solve the flow structure across the Bondi radius
and the outer part of the accretion disc simultaneously. The accreting gas with
finite angular momentum forms a rotationally-supported disc inside the Bondi
radius, where the accretion proceeds by the angular momentum transport due to
assumed alpha-type viscosity. We find that the interplay of radiation and
angular momentum significantly suppresses accretion even if the radiative
feedback is weakened in an equatorial shadowing region. The accretion rate is
O(alpha)\sim O(0.01-0.1) times the Bondi value, where alpha is the viscosity
parameter. By developing an analytical model, we show that such a great
reduction of the accretion rate persists unless the angular momentum is so
small that the corresponding centrifugal radius is \lesssim 0.04 times the
Bondi radius. We argue that BHs are hard to grow quickly via rapid mass
accretion considering the angular momentum barrier presented in this paper.

latter includes viscous, anomalous, and vortical effects, as well as accounts
for dynamical electromagnetism. The energy and momentum separations between the
Weyl nodes are taken into account via the topological Chern-Simons
contributions in the electric current and charge densities in Maxwell's
equations. When an external electric field is applied parallel to the slab, it
is found that the electron fluid velocity has a nonuniform profile determined
by the viscosity and the no-slip boundary conditions. Most remarkably, the
fluid velocity field develops a nonzero component across the slab that
gradually dissipates when approaching the surfaces. This abnormal component of
the flow arises due to the anomalous Hall voltage induced by the topological
Chern-Simons current. Another signature feature of the hydrodynamics in Weyl
semimetals is a strong modification of the anomalous Hall current along the
slab in the direction perpendicular to the applied electric field.
Additionally, it is found that the topological current induces an electric
potential difference between the surfaces of the slab that is strongly affected
by the hydrodynamic flow.

are a counter example to the no hair conjecture, in General Relativity
minimally coupled to simple matter fields (with mass $\mu$) obeying all energy
conditions. Since these solutions have, like Kerr, an ergoregion it has been a
lingering possibility that they are afflicted by the superradiant instability,
the same process that leads to their dynamical formation from Kerr. A recent
breakthrough [arXiv:1711.08464] confirmed this instability and computed the
corresponding timescales for a sample of solutions. We discuss how these
results and other observations support two conclusions: $1)$ starting from the
Kerr limit, the increase of hair for fixed coupling $\mu M$ (where $M$ is the
BH mass) increases the timescale of the instability; $2)$ there are hairy
solutions for which this timescale, for astrophysical black hole masses, is
larger than the age of the Universe. The latter conclusion introduces the
limited, but physically relevant concept of effective stability. The former
conclusion, allows us to identify an astrophysically viable domain of such
effectively stable hairy black holes, occurring, conservatively, for $M\mu
\lesssim 0.25$. These are hairy BHs that form dynamically, from the
superradiant instability of Kerr, within an astrophysical timescale, but whose
own superradiant instability occurs only in a cosmological timescale.

the r-process site produces roughly equal masses of high and low electron

  changes made to online news content",,,,,"cs.DL cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowadays, the Internet is indispensable when it comes to information
dissemination. People rely on the Internet to inform themselves on current news
events, as well as to verify facts. We, as a community, are quickly approaching
an 'electronic information age' where the majority of information will be
distributed electronically and tools to preserve this information will become
essential. While archiving online digital information is a good way to preserve
online information for future generations, it has many disadvantages including
the easy manipulation of archived information, e.g. by the archiving authority.
Online information is also prone to getting hacked or being taken offline.
Therefore, it is necessary that archived online news information is securely
time-stamped with the date and time when it was first archived in a way that
cannot be manipulated. The process of 'trusted timestamping' is an established
approach for claiming that particular digital information existed at a
particular 'point in time' in the past. However, traditional approaches for
trusted timestamping depend on the time-stamping authority's fidelity. Directly
embedding the hash of a digital file into the blockchain of a cryptocurrency is
a more recent method that allows for secure time-stamping, since digital
information is stored as part of the transaction information in, e.g.
Bitcoin's, blockchain, and not stored at a centralized time-stamping authority.
However, there is no system yet available, which uses this approach for
archiving and time-stamping online news articles. Therefore, the aim of this
thesis is to develop a system that 1) enables decentralized trusted
time-stamping of web and news articles as a means of making future manipulation
of online information identifiable, and 2) allows users to determine the
authenticity of articles by checking different versions of the same article
online.

surrounding a central old spheroid. At odds with the isolated Hoag's galaxy,
JO171 is part of a dense environment, the cluster Abell 3667, which is causing
gas stripping along tentacles. Moreover, its ring counter-rotates with respect
to the central spheroid. The joint analysis of the stellar populations and the
gas/stellar kinematics shows that the origin of the ring was not due to an
internal mechanism, but was related to a gas accretion event that happened in
the distant past, prior to accretion onto Abell 3667, most probably within a
filament. More recently, since infall in the cluster, the gas in the ring has
been stripped by ram- pressure, causing the quenching of star formation in the
stripped half of the ring. This is the first observed case of ram pressure
stripping in action in a ring galaxy, and MUSE observations are able to reveal
both of the events (accretion and stripping) that caused dramatic
transformations in this galaxy.

that support this picture are: 1) The galaxy is isolated, its position rules
out the mechanisms expected in dense environments. 2) It shows a pronounced
lopsidedness extending toward West. According to the spatially resolved star
formation history, this component was formed <6x10^8 yr ago. 3) It has many
large and elongated HII regions that are indication of a fragmentation due to
disk instability. 4) The stellar and gas kinematics are quite symmetric around
the same axis, but in the gas the locus of negative velocities shows a
convexity toward East, as if new gas has been infalling with different
orientation and velocity. 5) The metallicity distribution is inhomogeneous and
shows exceptionally steep gradients from the center toward the outskirts,
especially in the South-West side. 6) The luminosity weighted age is generally
low (~8 Gyr) and particularly low (<7 Gyr) along a trail crossing the galaxy
from South-West toward North. It might trace the path of the accreted gas.

stripping due to ram-pressure by the intra-cluster medium (ICM). The most
spectacular examples are galaxies with extended tails of optically-bright
stripped material known as ""jellyfish"". We use the first large homogeneous
compilation of jellyfish galaxies in clusters from the WINGS and OmegaWINGS
surveys, and follow-up MUSE observations from the GASP MUSE programme to
investigate the orbital histories of jellyfish galaxies in clusters and
reconstruct their stripping history through position vs. velocity phase- space
diagrams. We construct analytic models to define the regions in phase-space
where ram-pressure stripping is at play. We then study the distribution of
cluster galaxies in phase-space and find that jellyfish galaxies have on
average higher peculiar velocities (and higher cluster velocity dispersion)
than the overall population of cluster galaxies at all clustercentric radii,
which is indicative of recent infall into the cluster and radial orbits. In
particular, the jellyfish galaxies with the longest gas tails reside very near
the cluster cores (in projection) and are moving at very high speeds, which
coincides with the conditions of the most intense ram-pressure. We conclude
that many of the jellyfish galaxies seen in clusters likely formed via fast
(~1- 2 Gyr), incremental, outside-in ram-pressure stripping during first infall
into the cluster in highly radial orbits.

suggest that at the highest overpressure it is the rare, large fireballs (such
as the Chelyabinsk fireball) which dominate the long-term areal ground
footprints for heavy window damage. The height at the fireball peak brightness
and the fireball entry angle contribute to the variance in ground overpressure,
with lower heights and shallower angles producing larger ground footprints and
more potential damage. The effective threshold energy for fireballs to produce
heavy window damage is ~5 - 10 kT; such fireballs occur globally once every one
to two years. These largest annual bolide events, should they occur over a
major urban centre with large numbers of windows, can be expected to produce
economically significant window damage. However, the mean frequency of heavy
window damage (overpressure above 500 Pa) from fireball shock waves occurring
over urban areas is estimated to be approximately once every 5000 years. Light
window damage (overpressure above 200 Pa) is expected every ~600 years.

`natural data distribution', namely standard Gaussian feature vectors

tensor decomposition based on the sum-of-squares hierarchy.
  We also prove generalizations of this statement for higher degree polynomial

algorithms for learning two-layer networks with rigorous guarantees are based
on tensor decomposition. Our results support the idea that this is indeed the
core computational difficulty in learning such networks, under the stated

protein sequence, finds the best matching homologous family in a library of
pre-calculated, pre-annotated gene trees, and then grafts it to the best
location in the tree. It then annotates the sequence by propagating
anno-tations from its ancestral nodes in the reference tree. We show that
TreeGrafter outperforms subfamily HMM scoring for cor-rectly assigning
subfamily membership, and that it produces highly specific annotations of GO
terms based on annotated reference phylogenetic trees. This method will be

high-throughput mapping of the compositional phase diagrams of combinatorial

Here, we report a new method for pattern analysis and phase extraction of XRD
datasets. The method expands the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization method, which
has been used previously to analyze such datasets, by combining it with custom
clustering and cross-correlation algorithms. This new method is capable of
robust determination of the number of basis patterns present in the data which,
in turn, enables straightforward identification of any possible peak-shifted
patterns. Peak-shifting arises due to continuous change in the lattice
constants as a function of composition, and is ubiquitous in XRD datasets from
composition spread libraries. Successful identification of the peak-shifted
patterns allows proper quantification and classification of the basis XRD
patterns, which is necessary in order to decipher the contribution of each
unique single-phase structure to the multi-phase regions. The process can be
utilized to determine accurately the compositional phase diagram of a system
under study. The presented method is applied to one synthetic and one
experimental dataset, and demonstrates robust accuracy and identification
abilities.

signal-to-noise ratio (~200) spectra collected with WINERED, a near-infrared
(NIR) spectrograph covering simultaneously the wavelength range 0.91--1.35
micron. The effective temperature and the surface gravity at the pulsation
phase of the spectroscopic observation were estimated using both optical (V)
and NIR time-series photometric data. We found that the Mira is metal-rich
([Fe/H]=-0.55 \pm 0.15) and moderately alpha-enhanced ([alpha/Fe]=0.15 \pm
0.01, sigma=0.2). These values agree quite well with the mean cluster
abundances based on high-resolution optical spectra of several cluster red
giants available in the literature ([Fe/H]=-0.47 \pm 0.06, [alpha/Fe]=+0.24 \pm
0.05). We also found a Na abundance of +0.35 \pm 0.20 that is higher than the
mean cluster abundance based on optical spectra (+0.18 \pm 0.13). However, the
lack of similar spectra for cluster red giants and that of corrections for
departures from local-thermodynamical equilibrium prevents us from establishing
whether the difference is intrinsic or connected with multiple populations.
These findings indicate a strong similarity between optical and NIR metallicity
scales in spite of the difference in the experimental equipment, data analysis

emitters and theoretical studies suggest that the radio emission from nearby
exoplanets in close-in orbits could reach intensity levels $10^{3}-10^{7}$
times higher than Jupiter's decametric emission. Detection of exoplanets in the
radio domain would open up a brand new field of research, however, currently
there are no confirmed detections at radio frequencies.
  $\textit{Aims.}$ We investigate the radio emission from Jupiter, scaled such
that it mimics emission coming from an exoplanet, with low-frequency
beam-formed observations using LOFAR. The goals are to define a set of
observables that can be used as a guideline in the search for exoplanetary
radio emission and to measure effectively the sensitivity limit for LOFAR
beam-formed observations.
  $\textit{Methods.}$ We observe ""Jupiter as an exoplanet"" by dividing a LOFAR
observation of Jupiter by a down-scaling factor and adding this observation to
beam-formed data of the ""sky background"". Then we run this artificial dataset
through our total intensity (Stokes-I) and circular polarization (Stokes-V)
processing and post-processing pipelines and determine up to which down-scaling
factor Jupiter is still detected in the dataset.
  $\textit{Results.}$ We find that exoplanetary radio bursts can be detected at
5 pc if the circularly polarized flux is $10^5$ times stronger than the typical
level of Jupiter's radio bursts during active emission events
($\sim4\times10^{5}$ Jy). Equivalently, circularly polarized radio bursts can
be detected up to a distance of 20 pc (encompassing the known exoplanets 55
Cnc, Tau Bo\""{o}tis, and Upsilon Andromedae) assuming the level of emission is
$10^{5}$ times stronger than the peak flux of Jupiter's decametric burst
emission ($\sim6\times10^{6}$ Jy).

characterized in terms of extensional equalities between B\""ohm trees. It is
well known that the lambda-theory H*, arising by taking as observables the head
normal forms, equates two lambda-terms whenever their B\""ohm trees are equal up
to countably many possibly infinite eta-expansions. Similarly, two lambda-terms
are equal in Morris's original observational theory H+, generated by
considering as observable the beta-normal forms, whenever their B\""ohm trees
are equal up to countably many finite eta-expansions.
  The lambda-calculus also possesses a strong notion of extensionality called
""the omega-rule"", which has been the subject of many investigations. It is a
longstanding open problem whether the equivalence B-omega obtained by closing
the theory of B\""ohm trees under the omega-rule is strictly included in H+, as
conjectured by Sall\'e in the seventies. In this paper we demonstrate that the
two aforementioned theories actually coincide, thus disproving Sall\'e's

  The proof technique we develop for proving the latter inclusion is general
enough to provide as a byproduct a new characterization, based on bounded
eta-expansions, of the least extensional equality between B\""ohm trees.
Together, these results provide a taxonomy of the different degrees of

significantly produced by supernovae Type Ia. Thus, [S/Zn] cannot be reliably
used as a proxy for [$\alpha$/Fe]. We propose [O/S] as a function of [S/H] as a
possible alternative. At higher metallicities, the values of [S/Zn] measured in
Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems are inconsistent with those in local dwarf
galaxies, and are more compatible with the Milky Way disk. Low-metallicity
Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems are, however, consistent with the most metal-poor
stars in Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Assuming that the dust
depletions of S and Zn are negligible, our comparison indicates that the star
formation histories of Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems are on average different
from both the Milky Way and the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy.

interfacial and bulk DMIs. Examples include crystals with symmetry classes
C$_n$ as well as magnetic multilayers composed of a ferromagnet with a
noncentrosymmetric crystal and a nonmagnet with strong spin-orbit coupling. As
a striking result, we find that, in systems with a hybrid DMI, the
spin-orbit-torque-induced skyrmion Hall angle is asymmetric for the two
different skyrmion polarities ($\pm 1$ given by out-of-plane core
magnetization), even allowing one of them to be tuned to zero. We propose
several experimental ways to achieve the necessary straight skyrmion motion
(with zero Hall angle) for racetrack memories, even without antiferromagnetic
interactions or any interaction with another magnet. Our results can be
understood within a simple picture by using a global spin rotation which maps
the hybrid DMI model to an effective model containing purely interfacial DMI.
The formalism directly reveals the effective spin torque and effective current
that result in qualitatively different dynamics. Our work provides a way to
utilize symmetry breaking to eliminate detrimental phenomena as hybrid DMI
eliminates the skyrmion Hall angle.

correlation between scales. A Monte Carlo procedure was used to construct
random walks and to calculate first crossing distributions and consequently
mass functions for a constant barrier. Results. We show that the evolution

consistent with the ideas of the excursion set model, describes accurately the
mass function of dark matter haloes for values of $\nu \leq 1$ and
underestimates the number of larger haloes. Finally, we show that a constant

decisions within many areas including medicine and health care. However, most
of the research is directed towards developing tools, and little time and
effort is spent on testing the software to assure its quality. In testing, a
test oracle is used to determine whether a test is passed or failed during
testing, and unfortunately, for much of bioinformatics software, the exact
expected outcomes are not well defined. Thus, the main challenge associated
with conducting systematic testing on bioinformatics software is the oracle
problem.
  Metamorphic testing (MT) is a technique used to test programs that face the
oracle problem. MT uses metamorphic relations (MRs) to determine whether a test
has passed or failed and specifies how the output should change according to a
specific change made to the input. In this work, we use MT to test LingPipe, a
tool for processing text using computational linguistics, often used in
bioinformatics for bio-entity recognition from biomedical literature.
  First, we identify a set of MRs for testing any bio-entity recognition
program. Then we develop a set of test cases that can be used to test
LingPipe's bio-entity recognition functionality using these MRs. To evaluate
the effectiveness of this testing process, we automatically generate a set of
faulty versions of LingPipe. According to our analysis of the experimental
results, we observe that our MRs can detect the majority of these faulty
versions, which shows the utility of this testing technique for quality

experiments based on fluorescent techniques. We study the magnitude and
dynamics of density and color density fluctuations using a novel Brownian
dynamics algorithm, as well as fluctuating hydrodynamics theory and simulation.
We find that hydrodynamic coupling between a single tagged particle and
collective density fluctuations leads to a reduction of the long-time
self-diffusion coefficient, even for an ideal gas of non-interacting particles.
Using linearized fluctuating hydrodynamics theory, we show that for diffusion
on a fluid-fluid interface, nonequilibrium fluctuations of the total density
are small compared to the equilibrium fluctuations, but fluctuations of color
density are giant and exhibit a spectrum that decays as the inverse cubed power
of the wavenumber. We confirm these predictions through Brownian dynamics
simulations of diffusive mixing with two indistinguishable species. We also
examine nonequilibrium fluctuations in systems with two-dimensional
hydrodynamics, such as thin smectic films in vacuum. We find that
nonequilibrium fluctuations are colossal and comparable in magnitude to the
mean, and can be accurately modeled using numerical solvers for the nonlinear
equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics.

used either random test data or existing test cases as source test cases. There
has been limited research done on systematic source test case generation for
metamorphic testing. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation on the
impact of source test case generation techniques on the fault finding
effectiveness of metamorphic testing. We evaluated the effectiveness of line
coverage, branch coverage, weak mutation and random test generation strategies
for source test case generation. The experiments are conducted with 77 methods

creating source test cases, we can significantly increase the fault finding

the 1.3 mm continuum emission and a mid-infrared (MIR) extinction map of the
IRDC. This allows estimation of the ""dense gas"" detection probability function
(DPF), i.e., as a function of the local mass surface density, $\Sigma$, for
various choices of thresholds of mm continuum emission to define ""dense gas"".

probability distribution function, to the larger-scale surrounding regions,
finding values of about 5\% to 15\% for the fiducial choice of threshold. We
argue that this observed dense gas is a good tracer of the protostellar core
population and, in this context, estimate a star formation efficiency per
free-fall time in the central IRDC region of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}\sim$10\%, with

first-order correction of thermal diffusivity. Third, it can perform doubly
accurate measurement of the thermal diffusivity specified at a thermal

optimization formulation and a scalable Low-rank Tensor-based Label Propagation
algorithm (LowrankTLP) to infer multi-relations for two learning tasks,
hyperlink prediction and multiple graph alignment. The optimization formulation
minimizes the upper bound of the noisy tensor estimation error for multiple
graph alignment, by learning with a subset of the eigen-pairs in the spectrum
of the normalized tensor product graph. We also provide a data-dependent
transductive Rademacher bound for binary hyperlink prediction. We accelerate
LowrankTLP with parallel tensor computation which enables label propagation on
a tensor product of 100 graphs each of size 1000 in less than half hour in the
simulation. LowrankTLP was also applied to predicting the author-paper-venue
hyperlinks in publication records, alignment of segmented regions across up to
26 CT-scan images and alignment of protein-protein interaction networks across
multiple species. The experiments demonstrate that LowrankTLP indeed well

making it possible to record from large populations of neurons simultaneously.
However, determining the exact moment in time at which a neuron spikes, from a
calcium imaging data set, amounts to a non-trivial deconvolution problem which
is of critical importance for downstream analyses. While a number of
formulations have been proposed for this task in the recent literature, in this
paper we focus on a formulation recently proposed in Jewell and Witten (2017)
which has shown initial promising results. However, this proposal is slow to
run on fluorescence traces of hundreds of thousands of timesteps.
  Here we develop a much faster online algorithm for solving the optimization
problem of Jewell and Witten (2017) that can be used to deconvolve a
fluorescence trace of 100,000 timesteps in less than a second. Furthermore,
this algorithm overcomes a technical challenge of Jewell and Witten (2017) by
avoiding the occurrence of so-called ""negative"" spikes. We demonstrate that
this algorithm has superior performance relative to existing methods for spike
deconvolution on calcium imaging datasets that were recently released as part
of the spikefinder challenge (http://spikefinder.codeneuro.org/).

government-mandated encryption scheme is semantically secure against outsiders:
a perhaps advantageous feature to secure communication against foreign
entities. But what good is semantic security against an adversary that has the
power to decrypt?
  Even in this pessimistic scenario, we show citizens can communicate securely
and undetectably. Informally, there is a protocol between Alice and Bob where
they exchange ciphertexts that look innocuous even to someone who knows the
secret keys and thus sees the corresponding plaintexts. And yet, in the end,
Alice will have transmitted her secret message to Bob. Our security definition
requires indistinguishability between unmodified use of the mandated encryption
scheme, and conversations using the mandated encryption scheme in a modified
way for subliminal communication.
  Our topics may be thought to fall broadly within the realm of steganography:
the science of hiding secret communication in innocent-looking messages, or
cover objects. However, we deal with the non-standard setting of adversarial
cover object distributions (i.e., a stronger-than-usual adversary). We leverage
that our cover objects are ciphertexts of a secure encryption scheme to bypass
impossibility results which we show for broader classes of steganographic

problems arise when separation of variables is applied to separable boundary
value problems; a particular example is the Helmholtz equation in ellipsoidal

be challenging. An inherent difficulty is that, while for 2-parameter
eigenvalue problems we can exploit a relation to Sylvester equations to obtain
a fast Arnoldi type method, such a relation does not seem to exist when there
are three or more parameters. Instead, we introduce a subspace iteration method
with projections onto generalized Krylov subspaces that are constructed from
scratch at every iteration using certain Ritz vectors as the initial vectors.
Another possibility is a Jacobi--Davidson type method for three or more
parameters, which we generalize from its 2-parameter counterpart. For both
approaches, we introduce a selection criterion for deflation that is based on
the angles between left and right eigenvectors. The Jacobi--Davidson approach
is devised to locate eigenvalues close to a prescribed target, yet it often
also performs well when eigenvalues are sought based on the proximity of one of
the components to a prescribed target. The subspace iteration method is devised
specifically for the latter task. The proposed approaches are suitable
especially for problems where the computation of several eigenvalues is
required with high accuracy. Matlab implementations of both methods have been
made available in the package MultiParEig.

fundamental interest in nature and industrial applications. During drainage
processes in unsaturated soils and porous media in general, saturated clusters,

affect the relative permeability and effective stress of the system. In this
study, we experimentally studied drainage processes in unsaturated granular
media as a model porous system. The distribution of saturated clusters is
analysed by an optical imaging method under different drainage conditions, in
which pore-scale information from Voronoi and Delaunay tessellation was used to
characterise the topology of saturated cluster distributions. By employing
statistical analyses, the observed spatial and temporal information of
multiphase flow and fluid entrapment in porous media are described. The results
indicate that the distributions of both the crystallised cell size and pore
size are positively correlated to the spatial and temporal distribution of
saturated cluster sizes. The saturated cluster size is found to follow a
lognormal distribution, in which the generalised Bond number correlates
negatively to the scale parameter and positively to the shape parameter. These
findings can be used to connect pore-scale behaviour with overall
hydro-mechanical characteristics in partially saturated porous media, using
both the degree of saturation and generalised Bond number.

questions in solar physics. Our current understanding is that small-scale
internetwork (IN) magnetic fields play an important role as a heating agent.
Indeed, cancellations of IN magnetic elements in the photosphere can produce
transient brightenings in the chromosphere and transition region. These bright
structures might be the signature of energy release and plasma heating,
probably driven by magnetic reconnection of IN field lines. Although single
events are not expected to release large amounts of energy, their global
contribution to the chromosphere may be significant due to their ubiquitous
presence in quiet Sun regions. In this paper we study cancellations of IN
elements and analyze their impact on the energetics and dynamics of the quiet
Sun atmosphere. We use high resolution, multiwavelength, coordinated
observations obtained with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and
the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) to identify cancellations of IN magnetic
flux patches and follow their evolution. We find that, on average, these events
live for ~3 minutes in the photosphere and ~12 minutes in the chromosphere
and/or transition region. Employing multi-line inversions of the Mg II h & k
lines we show that cancellations produce clear signatures of heating in the
upper atmospheric layers. However, at the resolution and sensitivity accessible
to the SST, their number density still seems to be one order of magnitude too
low to explain the global chromospheric heating.

generalizes the ordering of (not necessarily contiguous) subwords. Each such
WQO induces a class of piecewise testable languages (PTLs) as Boolean
combinations of upward closed sets. In this way, a range of regular language
classes arises as PTLs. Moreover, each of the WQOs guarantees regularity of all
downward closed sets. We consider two problems. First, we study which (perhaps
non-regular) language classes permit a decision procedure to decide whether two
given languages are separable by a PTL with respect to a given WQO. Second, we
want to effectively compute downward closures with respect to these WQOs. Our
first main result that for each of the WQOs, under mild assumptions, both
problems reduce to the simultaneous unboundedness problem (SUP) and are thus
solvable for many powerful system classes. In the second main result, we apply
the framework to show decidability of separability of regular languages by

humans and machines. Therefore, tools for investigating rumor news have become
an urgent necessity. One useful function of such tools is to see ways a
specific topic or event is represented by presenting different points of view
from multiple sources.
  In this paper, we propose Maester, a novel agreement-aware search framework
for investigating rumor news. Given an investigative question, Maester will
retrieve related articles to that question, assign and display top articles
from agree, disagree, and discuss categories to users. Splitting the results
into these three categories provides the user a holistic view towards the
investigative question. We build Maester based on the following two key
observations: (1) relatedness can commonly be determined by keywords and
entities occurring in both questions and articles, and (2) the level of
agreement between the investigative question and the related news article can
often be decided by a few key sentences. Accordingly, we use gradient boosting
tree models with keyword/entity matching features for relatedness detection,
and leverage recurrent neural network to infer the level of agreement. Our
experiments on the Fake News Challenge (FNC) dataset demonstrate up to an order
of magnitude improvement of Maester over the original FNC winning solution, for
agreement-aware search.

providers on mechanism design. When no data provider is present, it has been
shown that simple mechanisms are ""good enough"" -- they can achieve a constant
fraction of the revenue of optimal mechanisms. The results in this paper
demonstrate that this is no longer true in the presence of a third-party data
provider who can provide the bidder with a signal that is correlated with the
item type. Specifically, even with a single seller, a single bidder, and a
single item of uncertain type for sale, the strategies of pricing each
item-type separately (the analog of item pricing for multi-item auctions) and
bundling all item-types under a single price (the analog of grand bundling) can
both simultaneously be a logarithmic factor worse than the optimal revenue.
Further, in the presence of a data provider, item-type partitioning
mechanisms---a more general class of mechanisms which divide item-types into
disjoint groups and offer prices for each group---still cannot achieve within a
$\log \log$ factor of the optimal revenue. Thus, our results highlight that the
presence of a data-provider forces the use of more complicated mechanisms in

with associated probability distributions. In the context of Space Situational
Awareness, however, the information available to a space analyst on many
uncertain components is scarce, preventing their appropriate modeling with a

typical example are human-based data sources such as Two-Line Elements (TLEs),
which are publicly available but lack any statistical description of their
accuracy. In this paper, we propose the first exploitation of uncertain
variables in a RSO tracking problem, allowing for a representation of the
uncertain components reflecting the information available to the space analyst,
however scarce, and nothing more. In particular, we show that a human-based

rigorous Bayesian estimator in order to track a RSO. We illustrate this concept
on a scenario where real TLEs queried from the U.S. Strategic Command are fused

some transmissions during the peak traffic times to the off-peak traffic times.
Multi-server coded caching, which can share responsibility for the total amount
of transmission in the wireless network during the peak traffic times by means
of the collaboration among these servers, can be seen everywhere in our life.
The three servers setting (two data servers and one parity check server) is
used in practice, e.g. redundant array of independent disks-4. In this
scenario, there are total $N$ files which are equally stored in two data
servers respectively and $K$ users each of which has the memory size of $M$
files. Each server connects to users by an independently channel. During the
off-peak traffic times, two data servers place some parts of each files in each
user's cache. In that time, servers do not know users' requests in future.
During the peak traffic times each user just requests one file from $N$ files.
Luo et al. in 2016 proposed the first coded caching scheme for this setting. In
this paper, we proposed some method that further reduces the amount of
transmission in each channel when $\frac{KM}{N}$ is odd. This method also
improves the transmission rate for systems with general multiply servers.

is a basic building block of highly successful modern neural networks as well

present algorithms for learning MoE including the EM algorithm, and gradient
descent are known to get stuck in local optima. From a theoretical viewpoint,
finding an efficient and provably consistent algorithm to learn the parameters
remains a long standing open problem for more than two decades. In this paper,
we introduce the first algorithm that learns the true parameters of a MoE model
for a wide class of non-linearities with global consistency guarantees. While
existing algorithms jointly or iteratively estimate the expert parameters and
the gating paramters in the MoE, we propose a novel algorithm that breaks the
deadlock and can directly estimate the expert parameters by sensing its echo in
a carefully designed cross-moment tensor between the inputs and the output.
Once the experts are known, the recovery of gating parameters still requires an
EM algorithm; however, we show that the EM algorithm for this simplified
problem, unlike the joint EM algorithm, converges to the true parameters. We
empirically validate our algorithm on both the synthetic and real data sets in

(Quantum Information and Computation 2014), which asserts the existence of
local Hamiltonians whose low energy states cannot be generated by constant
depth quantum circuits, identifies a fundamental obstacle to resolving the
quantum PCP conjecture. Progress towards the NLTS conjecture was made by Eldar
and Harrow (Foundations of Computer Science 2017), who proved a closely related
theorem called No Low-Error Trivial States (NLETS). In this paper, we give a
much simpler proof of the NLETS theorem, and use the same technique to
establish superpolynomial circuit size lower bounds for noisy ground states of
local Hamiltonians (assuming $\mathsf{QCMA} \neq \mathsf{QMA}$), resolving an
open question of Eldar and Harrow. We discuss the new light our results cast on
the relationship between NLTS and NLETS.
  Finally, our techniques imply the existence of $\textit{approximate quantum
low-weight check (qLWC) codes}$ with linear rate, linear distance, and constant
weight checks. These codes are similar to quantum LDPC codes except (1) each
particle may participate in a large number of checks, and (2) errors only need
to be corrected up to fidelity $1 - 1/\mathsf{poly}(n)$. This stands in
contrast to the best-known stabilizer LDPC codes due to Freedman, Meyer, and
Luo which achieve a distance of $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$.
  The principal technique used in our results is to leverage the Feynman-Kitaev
clock construction to approximately embed a subspace of states defined by a
circuit as the ground space of a local Hamiltonian.

spectral norm of a matrix ($p=q=2$) and the Grothendieck problem ($p=\infty$,
$q=1$), and has been widely studied in various regimes. When $p \geq q$, the
problem exhibits a dichotomy: constant factor approximation algorithms are
known if $2 \in [q,p]$, and the problem is hard to approximate within almost
polynomial factors when $2 \notin [q,p]$.
  The regime when $p < q$, known as \emph{hypercontractive norms}, is
particularly significant for various applications but much less well
understood. The case with $p = 2$ and $q > 2$ was studied by [Barak et al,
STOC'12] who gave sub-exponential algorithms for a promise version of the
problem (which captures small-set expansion) and also proved hardness of
approximation results based on the Exponential Time Hypothesis. However, no
NP-hardness of approximation is known for these problems for any $p < q$.
  We study the hardness of approximating matrix norms in both the above cases
and prove the following results:
  - We show that for any $1< p < q < \infty$ with $2 \notin [p,q]$,
$\|A\|_{p\rightarrow q}$ is hard to approximate within
$2^{O(\log^{1-\epsilon}\!n)}$ assuming $NP \not\subseteq
BPTIME(2^{\log^{O(1)}\!n})$. This suggests that, similar to the case of $p \geq
q$, the hypercontractive setting may be qualitatively different when $2$ does
not lie between $p$ and $q$.
  - For all $p \geq q$ with $2 \in [q,p]$, we show $\|A\|_{p\rightarrow q}$ is
hard to approximate within any factor than $1/(\gamma_{p^*} \cdot \gamma_q)$,
where for any $r$, $\gamma_r$ denotes the $r^{th}$ norm of a gaussian, and
$p^*$ is the dual norm of $p$.

a label and receive it, real annotation often presents a mismatch between the
form of a label (say, one among many classes), and the form of an annotation
(typically yes/no binary feedback). To annotate examples corpora for multiclass
classification, we might need to ask multiple yes/no questions, exploiting a
label hierarchy if one is available. To address this more realistic setting, we
propose active learning with partial feedback (ALPF), where the learner must
actively choose both which example to label and which binary question to ask.
At each step, the learner selects an example, asking if it belongs to a chosen
(possibly composite) class. Each answer eliminates some classes, leaving the
learner with a partial label. The learner may then either ask more questions
about the same example (until an exact label is uncovered) or move on
immediately, leaving the first example partially labeled. Active learning with
partial labels requires (i) a sampling strategy to choose (example, class)
pairs, and (ii) learning from partial labels between rounds. Experiments on
Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our most effective method improves 26%
(relative) in top-1 classification accuracy compared to i.i.d. baselines and
standard active learners given 30% of the annotation budget that would be
required (naively) to annotate the dataset. Moreover, ALPF-learners fully
annotate TinyImageNet at 42% lower cost. Surprisingly, we observe that
accounting for per-example annotation costs can alter the conventional wisdom
that active learners should solicit labels for hard examples.

delay-sensitive short flows are commonly presented in shallow-buffered
switches. Long flows could potentially block the transmission of
delay-sensitive short flows, leading to degraded performance. Congestion can
also be caused by the synchronization of multiple TCP connections for short
flows, as typically seen in the partition/aggregate traffic pattern. While
multiple end-to-end transport-layer solutions have been proposed, none of them
have tackled the real challenge: reliable transmission in the network. In this
paper, we fill this gap by presenting PABO -- a novel link-layer design that
can mitigate congestion by temporarily bouncing packets to upstream switches.
PABO's design fulfills the following goals: i) providing per-flow based flow
control on the link layer, ii) handling transient congestion without the
intervention of end devices, and iii) gradually back propagating the congestion
signal to the source when the network is not capable to handle the
congestion.Experiment results show that PABO can provide prominent advantage of
mitigating transient congestions and can achieve significant gain on end-to-end

computation, modeled by games played on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Close
connections between pebbling and cryptography have been known for decades. A
series of recent research starting with (Alwen and Serbinenko, STOC 2015) has
deepened our understanding of the notion of memory-hardness in cryptography ---
a useful property of hash functions for deterring large-scale password-cracking
attacks --- and has shown memory-hardness to have intricate connections with
the theory of graph pebbling.
  In this work, we improve upon two main limitations of existing models of
memory-hardness. First, existing measures of memory-hardness only account for
dynamic (i.e., runtime) memory usage, and do not consider static memory usage.
We propose a new definition of static-memory-hard function (SHF) which takes
into account static memory usage and allows the formalization of larger memory
requirements for efficient functions, than in the dynamic setting (where memory
usage is inherently bounded by runtime). We then give two SHF constructions
based on pebbling; to prove static-memory-hardness, we define a new pebble game
(""black-magic pebble game""), and new graph constructions with optimal
complexity under our proposed measure.
  Secondly, existing memory-hardness models implicitly consider linear
tradeoffs between the costs of time and space. We propose a new model to
capture nonlinear time-space trade-offs and prove that nonlinear tradeoffs can
in fact cause adversaries to employ different strategies from linear tradeoffs.
  Finally, as an additional contribution of independent interest, we present
the first asymptotically tight graph construction that achieves the best
possible space complexity up to $\log{\log{n}}$-factors for an existing
memory-hardness measure called cumulative complexity in the sequential pebbling
model.

matrix, a latent state of SGLDS can be categorized as either a non-dynamic
state or a dynamic one. A normal-gamma construction is used to shrink the
energy captured by the non-dynamic states, while the dynamic states can be
further categorized into live, absorbing, or noise-injection states, which
capture different types of dynamical components of the underlying time series.

multi-attributed data words. The winner of the game is specified by formulas in
the Logic of Repeating Values, which can reason about repetitions of data
values in infinite data words. We prove that it is undecidable to check if one
of the players has a winning strategy, even in very restrictive settings.
However, we prove that if one of the players is restricted to choose valuations
ranging over the Boolean domain, the games are effectively equivalent to
single-sided games on vector addition systems with states (in which one of the
players can change control states but cannot change counter values), known to
be decidable and effectively equivalent to energy games.
  Previous works have shown that the satisfiability problem for various
variants of the logic of repeating values is equivalent to the reachability and
coverability problems in vector addition systems. Our results raise this

networks has attracted increasing attention recently. However, training deep
hashing networks for the task is challenging due to the binary constraints on
the hash codes, the similarity preserving property, and the requirement for a
vast amount of labelled images. To the best of our knowledge, none of the
existing methods has tackled all of these challenges completely in a unified
framework. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach
for the task, in which the network is trained to produce binary codes directly
from image pixels without the need of manual annotation. In particular, to deal
with the non-smoothness of binary constraints, we propose a novel pairwise
constrained loss function, which simultaneously encodes the distances between
pairs of hash codes, and the binary quantization error. In order to train the
network with the proposed loss function, we propose an efficient parameter
learning algorithm. In addition, to provide similar / dissimilar training
images to train the network, we exploit 3D models reconstructed from unlabelled
images for automatic generation of enormous training image pairs. The extensive
experiments on image retrieval benchmark datasets demonstrate the improvements
of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art compact representation methods
on the image retrieval problem.

polarization measurements towards four bright-rimmed clouds, IC1396A, BRC 37,
BRC 38, and BRC 39, located in the different directions of the H II region,
Sh2-131, in order to map magnetic fields (B-fields) in the plane of the sky.
These BRCs are illuminated by the O star HD206267 and present a range of
projected on sky geometries. This provides an opportunity to understand the
magnetized evolution of BRCs. The B-field geometries of the clouds deduced from
the polarization data, after correction for foreground ISM contamination, are
seen to be connected to the ambient B-fields on the large scale. They seem to
play an important role in shaping the cloud IC1396A and BRC 37. BRCs 38 and 39
show a broader and snubber head morphology possibly due to the B-fields being
aligned with incoming radiation as explained in the simulations. A good general
agreement is noted on comparing our observational results with the simulations
supporting the importance of B-fields in BRC evolution. This work is the first
step towards systematic mapping the B-fields morphology in multiple BRCs in an

elevator climber is a laser/photovoltaic (PV) system. In this, a ground-based
laser beam would transmit megawatts of optical power through the atmosphere to
an arrangement of PV panels mounted on the ascending climber. Although this
technique has been successfully demonstrated in small models, this method will
likely suffer from serious shortcomings in a realistic full-scale system,
including poor conversion efficiency, obscuration by clouds, and mechanical
fragility of the panels. Worse, the PV method provides no means of regenerative

multi-megawatt levels for as long as 14 days (the time for the climber to reach
geosynchronous altitudes). No such laser has ever been demonstrated.
  This paper presents a radical alternative method for propelling a space
elevator car: by using the cable to transmit power in the form of transverse
mechanical waves propagated on the cable. A ground-based mechanical driving
oscillator would excite the waves. Traveling at hypersonic speeds, the waves
encounter the climber. This mechanical power is then extracted by an engine in
the climber to propel the climber upward. The oscillator may be manifested by a
pair of opposing pistons contacting the cable on opposite sides of the cable,
near the anchor point. Most importantly, existing engines can easily provide
the required amount of power to send a 10 metric-ton car from the ground to
geosynchronous altitudes.

popular variants of MCMC for problems when an MCMC state consists of an unknown
number of components. It is well known that state-of-the-art methods for
split-merge MCMC do not scale well. Strategies for rapid mixing requires smart
and informative proposals to reduce the rejection rate. However, all known
smart proposals involve expensive operations to suggest informative
transitions. As a result, the cost of each iteration is prohibitive for massive
scale datasets. It is further known that uninformative but computationally
efficient proposals, such as random split-merge, leads to extremely slow
convergence. This tradeoff between mixing time and per update cost seems hard
to get around.
  In this paper, we show a sweet spot. We leverage some unique properties of
weighted MinHash, which is a popular LSH, to design a novel class of
split-merge proposals which are significantly more informative than random
sampling but at the same time efficient to compute. Overall, we obtain a
superior tradeoff between convergence and per update cost. As a direct
consequence, our proposals are around 6X faster than the state-of-the-art
sampling methods on two large real datasets KDDCUP and PubMed with several

We also study a similar notion of asymptotic efficiency for checkpointing when
the task is infinite a.s. and the inter-checkpoint times are i.i.d.. Moreover,
in checkpointing, when the failures are exponentially distributed, we prove the
existence of an infinite sequence of universal checkpoints, which are always
used whenever the system starts from any checkpoint that precedes them.

supply, economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability, referred to
as the energy trilemma. Although there are clear conflicts within the trilemma,
member countries have acted to facilitate a fully integrated European
electricity market. Interconnection and cross-border electricity trade has been
a fundamental part of such market liberalisation. However, it has been
suggested that consumers are exposed to a higher price volatility as a
consequence of interconnection. Furthermore, during times of energy shortages
and high demand, issues of national sovereignty take precedence over
cooperation. In this article, the unique and somewhat peculiar conditions of
early 2017 within France, Germany and the United Kingdom have been studied to
understand how the existing integration arrangements address the energy
trilemma. It is concluded that the dominant interests are economic and national
security; issues of environmental sustainability are neglected or overridden.
Although the optimisation of European electricity generation to achieve a lower
overall carbon emission is possible, such a goal is far from being realised.
Furthermore, it is apparent that the United Kingdom, and other countries,
cannot rely upon imports from other countries during periods of high demand
and/or limited supply.

gamma-ray emission associated with Loop I, a radio continuum loop spanning
across 100 deg on the sky, is still being debated. The northern-most part of
Loop I, known as the North Polar Spur (NPS), is the brightest arm and is even
clearly visible in the ROSAT X-ray sky map. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive review on the X-ray observations of the Fermi bubbles and their
possible association with the NPS and Loop I structures. Using uniform analysis
of archival Suzaku and Swift data, we show that X-ray plasma with kT ~ 0.3 keV

Loop I and is naturally interpreted as weakly shock-heated Galactic halo gas.
However, the observed asymmetry of the X-ray-emitting gas above and below the
GC has still not been resolved; it cannot be fully explained by the inclination
of the axis of the Fermi bubbles to the Galactic disk normal. We argue that the
NPS and Loop I may be asymmetric remnants of a large explosion that occurred
before the event that created the Fermi bubbles, and that the soft gamma-ray
emission from Loop I may be due to either pi^0 decay of accelerated protons or
electron bremsstrahlung.

astonishingly low-power tags, but has thus far been restricted to narrowband
systems with low localization resolution. The challenge to combining these
complimentary technologies is that they share a compounding limitation,
constrained transmit power. Regulations limit ultra wideband transmissions to
just -41.3 dBm/MHz, and a backscatter device can only reflect the power it
receives. The solution is long-term integration of this limited power, lifting
the initially imperceptible signal out of the noise. This integration only
works while the target is stationary. However, stationary describes the vast
majority of objects, especially lost ones. With this insight, we design
Slocalization, a sub-microwatt, decimeter-accurate localization system that
opens a new tradeoff space in localization systems and realizes an energy,
size, and cost point that invites the localization of every thing. To evaluate
this concept, we implement an energy-harvesting Slocalization tag and find that

(aLIGO) has detected black hole (BH) merger events, most of which are sourced
by BHs more massive than $30~M_\odot$. Especially, the observation of GW170104
suggests dynamically assembled binaries favoring a distribution of misaligned
spins. It has been argued that mergers of unassociated BHs can be engendered
through a ""chance meeting"" in a multiple BH system under gas-rich environments.
In this paper, we consider the merger of unassociated BHs, concordant with the
massive BH merger events. To that end, we simulate a multiple BH system with a
post-Newtonian $N$-body code incorporating gas accretion and general
relativistic effects. As a result, we find that gas dynamical friction
effectively promotes three-body interaction of BHs in dense gas of
$n_\mathrm{gas}\gtrsim 10^6\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, so that BH mergers can take
place within $30$ Myr. This scenario predicts an isotropic distribution of spin
tilts. In the concordant models with GW150914, the masses of seed BHs are
required to be $\gtrsim 25~M_\odot$. The potential sites of such ""chance
meeting"" BH mergers are active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks and dense
interstellar clouds. Assuming the LIGO O1, we roughly estimate the event rates
for PopI BHs and PopIII BHs in AGN disks to be respectively $\simeq
1-2\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and $\simeq 1\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Multiple episodes of
AGNs may enhance the rates by roughly an order of magnitude. For massive PopI
BHs in dense interstellar clouds, the rate is $\simeq 0.02\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.
Hence, high-density AGN disks are a more plausible site for mergers of chance
meeting BHs.

exploited yet. The European AutoMat project has therefore defined an open
Common Vehicle Information Model (CVIM) in combination with a cross-industry,
cloud-based big data marketplace. Thereby, vehicle sensor data can be leveraged
for the design of entirely new services even beyond traffic-related
applications (such as localized weather forecasts). This paper focuses on the
prediction of the achievable data rate making use of an analytical model based
on empirical measurements. For an in-depth analysis, the CVIM has been
integrated in a vehicle traffic simulator to produce CVIM-complaint data
streams as a result of the individual behavior of each vehicle (speed, brake
activity, steering activity, etc.). In a next step, a simulation of vehicle
traffic in a realistically modeled, large-area street network has been used in
combination with a cellular Long Term Evolution (LTE) network to determine the
cumulated amount of data produced within each network cell. As a result, a new
car-to-cloud communication traffic model has been derived, which quantifies the
data rate of aggregated car-to-cloud data producible by vehicles depending on
the current traffic situations (free flow and traffic jam). The results provide
a reference for network planning and resource scheduling for car-to-cloud type
services in the context of smart cities.

downlink (DL) cellular networks will continuously decrease and finally to zero
with the network densification in a fully loaded ultra-dense network (UDN) when
the absolute height difference between a base station (BS) antenna and a user
equipment (UE) antenna is larger than zero, which is referred as the ASE Crash.
We revisit this issue by considering the impact of the BS antenna downtilt on
the downlink network capacity. In general, there exists a height difference
between a BS and a UE in practical networks. It is common to utilize antenna
downtilt to adjust the direction of the vertical antenna pattern, and thus
increase received signal power or reduce inter-cell interference power to
improve network performance. This paper focuses on investigating the
relationship between the base station antenna downtilt and the downlink network
capacity in terms of the coverage probability and the ASE. The analytical
results of the coverage probability and the ASE are derived, and we find that
there exists an optimal antenna downtilt to achieve the maximal coverage
probability for each base station density. Moreover, we derive numerically
solvable expressions for the optimal antenna downtilt, which is a function of
the base station density. Our theoretical and numerical results show that after
applying the optimal antenna downtilt, the network performance can be improved
significantly. Specifically, with the optimal antenna downtilt, the ASE crash
can be delayed by nearly one order of magnitude in terms of the base station
density.

model of tangentially driven self-propelled worm-like chains. The combination
of excluded-volume interactions and self-propulsion leads to several distinct
dynamic phases as a function of bending rigidity, activity, and aspect ratio of
individual filaments. We consider first the case of intermediate filament
density. For high-aspect-ratio filaments, we identify a transition with
increasing propulsion from a state of free-swimming filaments to a state of
spiraled filaments with nearly frozen translational motion. For lower aspect
ratios, this gas-of-spirals phase is suppressed with growing density due to
filament collisions; instead, filaments form clusters similar to self-propelled
rods, as activity increases. Finite bending rigidity strongly effects the
dynamics and phase behavior. Flexible filaments form small and transient
clusters, while stiffer filaments organize into giant clusters, similarly as
self-propelled rods, but with a reentrant phase behavior from giant to smaller
clusters as activity becomes large enough to bend the filaments. For high
filament densities, we identify a nearly frozen jamming state at low
activities, a nematic laning state at intermediate activities, and an
active-turbulence state at high activities. The latter state is characterized
by a power-law decay of the energy spectrum as a function of wave number. The
resulting phase diagrams encapsulate tunable non-equilibrium steady states that
can be used in the organization of living matter.

exhibits a superbubble and a rich massive star population. We observed these
massive stars using the FLAMES multi-object spectrograph at ESO-VLT. Available
UV spectra from HST, IUE, and FUSE are also used. The spectral analysis is
performed with Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmospheres. We present the
stellar and wind parameters of the OB stars and the two WR binaries in the N206
complex. Twelve percent of the sample show Oe/Be type emission lines, although
most of them appear to rotate far below critical. We found eight runaway stars
based on their radial velocity. The wind-momentum luminosity relation of our OB
sample is consistent with the expectations. The HRD of the OB stars reveals a
large age spread (1-30 Myr), suggesting different episodes of star formation in
the complex. The youngest stars are concentrated in the inner part of the
complex, while the older OB stars are scattered over outer regions. We derived
the present day mass function for the entire N206 complex as well as for the
cluster NGC2018. Three very massive Of stars are found to dominate the feedback
among 164 OB stars in the sample. The two WR winds alone release about as much
mechanical luminosity as the whole OB star sample. The cumulative mechanical
feedback from all massive stellar winds is comparable to the combined
mechanical energy of the supernova explosions that likely occurred in the
complex. Accounting also for the WR wind and supernovae, the mechanical input
over the last five Myr is ~$2.3\times10^{52}$ erg, which exceeds the current
energy content of the complex by more than a factor of five. The morphology of
the complex suggests a leakage of hot gas from the superbubble.

second-order dynamical phase transition found previously for $L=0$ at a
critical value $H=H_c$. We show that $|H|$ and $L$ play the roles of inverse
temperature and external magnetic field, respectively. In particular, we find a
first-order dynamical phase transition when $L$ changes sign, at supercritical
$H$. We also determine analytically $\mathcal{P}\left(H,L,t\right)$ in several
limits away from the second-order transition. Typical fluctuations of $H$ are
Gaussian, but the distribution tails are highly asymmetric. The tails
$-\ln\mathcal{P}\sim\left|H\right|^{3/2} \! /\sqrt{t}$ and
$-\ln\mathcal{P}\sim\left|H\right|^{5/2} \! /\sqrt{t}$, previously found for
$L=0$, are enhanced for $L \ne 0$. At very large $|L|$ the whole

time, effort and cost. This paper proposes Density Weighted Connectivity of
Grass Pixels (DWCGP) to automatically estimate grass biomass from roadside
image data. The DWCGP calculates the length of continuously connected grass
pixels along a vertical orientation in each image column, and then weights the
length by the grass density in a surrounding region of the column. Grass pixels
are classified using feedforward artificial neural networks and the dominant
texture orientation at every pixel is computed using multi-orientation Gabor
wavelet filter vote. Evaluations on a field survey dataset show that the DWCGP
reduces Root-Mean-Square Error from 5.84 to 5.52 by additionally considering
grass density on top of grass height. The DWCGP shows robustness to
non-vertical grass stems and to changes of both Gabor filter parameters and
surrounding region widths. It also has performance close to human observation
and higher than eight baseline approaches, as well as promising results for
classifying low vs. high fire risk and identifying fire-prone road regions.

techniques to predict the arrival time and properties of coronal mass ejections

technique suitable for the next generation of Space Weather predictive tools
that is both efficient and accurate. The aim of the new approach is to provide
interplanetary space weather forecasting models with accurate time dependent
boundary conditions of erupting magnetic flux ropes in the upper solar corona.
To produce boundary conditions, we couple two different modelling techniques,
MHD simulations and a quasi-static non-potential evolution model. Both are
applied on a spatial domain that covers the entire solar surface. The
non-potential model uses a time series of observed synoptic magnetograms to
drive the non-potential quasi-static evolution of the coronal magnetic field.
This allows us to follow the formation and loss of equilibrium of magnetic flux
ropes. Following this a MHD simulation captures the dynamic evolution of the
erupting flux rope. The present paper focuses on the MHD simulations that
follow the ejection of magnetic flux ropes to 4$R_\odot$. We first propose a
technique for specifying the pre-eruptive plasma properties in the corona.
Next, time dependent MHD simulations describe the ejection of two magnetic flux
ropes, that produce time dependent boundary conditions for the magnetic field
and plasma at 4$R_{\odot}$. In the present paper, we show that the dual use of
quasi-static non-potential magnetic field simulations and full time dependent
MHD simulations can produce realistic inhomogeneous boundary conditions for
space weather forecasting tools. Before a fully operational model can be
produced there are a number of technical and scientific challenges that still
need to be addressed.

modelling to examine the constraints provided by J, H, and K bands in
combination with mid-infrared surface brightness at 3.6 $\mu$m. We use a
spherical one-dimensional and elliptical three-dimensional cloud models to
study the observable effects of different grain size distributions with varying
absorption and scattering properties. As an example, we analyse observations of
a molecular cloud in Taurus, TMC-1N. The observed surface brightness ratios
between the bands change when the dust properties are changed. However, even a
small change of 10% in the surface brightness of one channel changes the
estimated powerlaw exponent of the size distribution $\gamma$ by up to ~30% and
the estimated strength of the radiation field K_ISRF by up to ~60%. The maximum
grain size A_max and $\gamma$ are always strongly anti-correlated. For example,
overestimating the surface brightness by 10% changes the estimated radiation
field strength by ~20% and the exponent of the size distribution by ~15%. The
analysis of our synthetic observations indicates that the relative uncertainty
of the parameter distributions are on average A_max, $\gamma$ ~25%, and the
deviation between the estimated and correct values $\Delta$ Q <15%. We show
that scattered infrared light can be used to derive meaningful limits for the

formulation is adopted and a discontinuous Galerkin method (DG) is employed to
solve the pressure equation. Capillary effects can be neglected in high-rate

in combination with the one-dimensional front tracking method to solve the
transport equation. To handle the high computational costs of the DG
approximation, domain decomposition is applied combined with an algebraic
multigrid preconditioner to solve the linear system. Special care at the

Descent at its center and then proceed to develop generalizations and

the alternative approach of putting Exponential Weights (EW) first. We show
that many standard methods and their regret bounds then follow as a special
case by plugging in suitable surrogate losses and playing the EW posterior
mean. For instance, we easily recover Online Gradient Descent by using EW with
a Gaussian prior on linearized losses, and, more generally, all instances of
Online Mirror Descent based on regular Bregman divergences also correspond to
EW with a prior that depends on the mirror map. Furthermore, appropriate
quadratic surrogate losses naturally give rise to Online Gradient Descent for
strongly convex losses and to Online Newton Step. We further interpret several
recent adaptive methods (iProd, Squint, and a variation of Coin Betting for
experts) as a series of closely related reductions to exp-concave surrogate
losses that are then handled by Exponential Weights. Finally, a benefit of our
EW interpretation is that it opens up the possibility of sampling from the EW
posterior distribution instead of playing the mean. As already observed by
Bubeck and Eldan, this recovers the best-known rate in Online Bandit Linear
Optimization.

color images. The two encryption schemes are based on dividing each image into
blocks of different sizes. In the first scheme, the two dimension ($2$D) input
image is divided into various blocks of size $N \times N$. Each block is
transformed into a one dimensional ($1$D) array by using the Zigzag pattern.
Then, the exclusive or (XOR) logical operation is used to encrypt each block
with the analogous secret key. In the second scheme, after the transformation
process, the first block of each image is encrypted by the corresponding secret
key. Then, before the next block is encrypted, it is XORed with the first
encrypted block to become the next input to the encrypting routine and so on.
This feedback mechanism depends on the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode of
operation which considers the heart of some ciphers because it is highly
nonlinear. In the case of color images, the color component is separated into
blocks with the same size and different secret keys. The used secret key
sequences are generated from elliptic curves (EC) over a \textit{binary} finite
field $\mathbb{F}_{2^{m}}$. Finally, the experimental results are carried out
and security analysis of the ciphered images are demonstrated that the two
proposed schemes had a better performance in terms of security, sensitivity and
robustness.

clinical outcomes when compared to existing linear approaches. In this paper,
we present fast and accurate planning methods for such nonlinear access paths.
Methods: We define a specific motion planning problem in SE(3) = R3 x SO(3)
with notable constraints in computation time and goal pose that reflect the
requirements of temporal bone surgery.We then present k-RRT-Connect: two
suitable motion planners based on bidirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Trees

are demonstrated on real CT data of patients. Their general performance is
shown on a large set of realistic synthetic anatomies. We also show that these

sheets in Poynting-dominated plasma is studied for the first time. Over the
past few decades, a lot of efforts have been conducted on studying the
evolution of current sheets in 2-dimensional space, and concluded that
sufficiently long current sheets always evolves into the so-called
""plasmoid-chain"", which provides fast reconnection rate independent of its
resistivity. However, it is suspected that plasmoid-chain can exist only in the
case of 2-dimensional approximation, and would show transition to turbulence in
3-dimensional space.
  We performed 3-dimensional numerical simulation of relativistic current sheet
using resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic approximation. The results
showed that the 3-dimensional current sheet evolve not into plasmoid-chain but
turbulence. The resulting reconnection rate is $0.004$ which is much smaller
than that of plasmoid-chain. The energy conversion from magnetic field to
kinetic energy of turbulence is just 0.01\% which is much smaller than typical
non-relativistic cases. Using the energy principle, we also showed that the
plasmoid is always unstable for a displacement in opposite direction to its
acceleration, probably interchange-type instability, and this always results in
seeds of turbulence behind the plasmoids. Finally, the temperature distribution
along the sheet is discussed, and it is found that the sheet is less active
than plasmoid-chain. Our finding can be applied for many high energy
astrophysical phenomena, and can provide a basic model of the general current
sheet in Poynting-dominated plasma.

factor $\Gamma\leq10^4$, is followed by a mildly relativistic plateau-afterglow
phase with $\Gamma\lesssim2$. The GeV radiation, with $\Gamma\lesssim50$,
coexists with the above two phases. It is shown that: a) the GeV radiation
originates at the onset of the formation of a black hole (BH), b) its
luminosity follows specific power-law dependence when measured in the rest
frame of the source with a decay index $\gamma=-1.29\pm0.06$ in the case of the

the case of short GRBs in this article and give the extended analysis for long

in their X-ray energy spectra. The observed lines have three distinct features;
(1) the line profiles are skewed and show significant low-energy tails, (2) the
Fe-K band have low variability, which produces a broad and deep dip in the
root-mean-square (rms) spectra, and (3) photons in this band have time lags
behind those in the adjacent energy bands with amplitudes of several $R_g/c$,
where $R_g$ is the gravitational radius. The ""relativistic light bending model""
is proposed to explain these observed features, where a compact X-ray source
(lamp post) above an extreme Kerr black hole illuminates the innermost area of
the accretion disc. In this paper, we critically examine the relativistic light
bending model by computing the rms spectra and the lag features using a
ray-tracing technique, when a lamp post moves vertically on the black hole spin
axis. As a result, we found that the observed deep rms dip requires that the
iron is extremely overabundant ($\gtrsim10$ solar), whereas the observed lag
amplitude is consistent with the normal iron abundance. Furthermore,
disappearance of the lag in the high-flux state requires a source height as
high as $\sim40\,R_g$, which contradicts the relativistically broad emission
line feature. Our simulations agree with the data that the reverberation
feature moves to lower frequencies with larger source height, however, if this
scenario is correct, the simulations predict detection of a clear Fe-K lag at
low frequencies, which is not constrained in the data. Therefore, we conclude
that the relativistic light bending model may not explain the characteristic
Fe-K spectral variations in Seyfert galaxies.

that is, when the flow settles, is formulated as finding the optimal ratio
between the total variation functional and a linear functional. The minimal
value for this quotient is referred to as the critical yield number or, in
analogy to Rayleigh quotients, generalized eigenvalue. This minimum value can
in general only be attained by discontinuous, hence not physical, velocities.
However, we prove that these generalized eigenfunctions, whose jumps we refer
to as limiting yield surfaces, appear as rescaled limits of the physical
velocities. Then, we show the existence of geometrically simple minimizers.
Furthermore, a numerical method for the minimization is then considered. It is
based on a nonlinear finite difference discretization, whose consistency is
proven, and a standard primal-dual descent scheme. Finally, numerical examples
show a variety of geometric solutions exhibiting the properties discussed in
the theoretical sections.

  1. Infectious disease outbreaks in plants threaten ecosystems, agricultural
crops and food trade. Currently, several fungal diseases are affecting forests
worldwide, posing a major risk to tree species, habitats and consequently
ecosystem decay. Prediction and control of disease spread are difficult, mainly
due to the complexity of the interaction between individual components
involved.
  2. In this work, we introduce a lattice-based epidemic model coupled with a
stochastic process that mimics, in a very simplified way, the interaction
between the hosts and pathogen. We studied the disease spread by measuring the
propagation velocity of the pathogen on the susceptible hosts. Quantitative
results indicate the occurrence of a critical transition between two stable
phases: local confinement and an extended epiphytotic outbreak that depends on
the density of the susceptible individuals.
  3. Quantitative predictions of epiphytotics are performed using the framework
early-warning indicators for impending regime shifts, widely applied on
dynamical systems. These signals forecast successfully the outcome of the
critical shift between the two stable phases before the system enters the
epiphytotic regime.
  4. Synthesis: Our study demonstrates that early-warning indicators could be
useful for the prediction of forest disease epidemics through mathematical and
computational models suited to more specific pathogen-host-environmental
interactions.

Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for autonomous agents

hyperbolic geometry of $\mathcal{C}$ within $\mathcal{C}^\delta$ provides the
class of complex cells with a rich geometric function theory absent in the real
case. We use this to prove a complex analog of the cellular decomposition
theorem of real tame geometry. In the algebraic case we show that the
complexity of such decompositions depends polynomially on the degrees of the
equations involved.
  Using this theory, we refine the Yomdin-Gromov algebraic lemma on
$C^r$-smooth parametrizations of semialgebraic sets: we show that the number of
$C^r$ charts can be taken to be polynomial in the smoothness order $r$ and in
the complexity of the set. The algebraic lemma was initially invented in the
work of Yomdin and Gromov to produce estimates for the topological entropy of
$C^\infty$ maps. For analytic maps our refined version, combined with work of
Burguet, Liao and Yang, establishes an optimal refinement of these estimates in
the form of tight bounds on the tail entropy and volume growth. This settles a
conjecture of Yomdin who proved the same result in dimension two in 1991. A
self-contained proof of these estimates using the refined algebraic lemma is
given in an appendix by Yomdin.
  The algebraic lemma has more recently been used in the study of rational
points on algebraic and transcendental varieties. We use the theory of complex
cells in these two directions. In the algebraic context we refine a result of
Heath-Brown on interpolating rational points in algebraic varieties. In the

simulating the near-continuum flows, but fail in description of those flows
which are removed far away from local equilibrium. In this paper, a diatomic
nonlinear model named as nonlinear coupled constitutive relations (NCCR),
derived from Eu's generalized hydrodynamics and proposed by Myong, is presented
as an alternative for simulating these hypersonic gas flows with a goal of
recovering NSF's solutions in continuum regime and being superior in transition
regime. To guarantee stable computation, a reliable and efficient coupled
algorithm is proposed for this diatomic nonlinear constitutive model.
Constitutive-curve analysis is carried out in detail to compare this coupled
algorithm with Myong's previous algorithm. Local flow regions are investigated
carefully in these hypersonic flows past a cone tip, a hollow cylinder-flare
and a HTV-type vehicle. The convergent solutions of NCCR model are compared
with NSF, DSMC calculations and experiment. It is demonstrated that the NCCR
model works as efficiently as the NSF model in continuum regime, but more
accurately compared with DSMC and experiment than NSF in non-equilibrium flows.
The discrepancies of flow- field and surface parameters, imply a potential for
remedying NSF's deficiency in local non-equilibrium regions.

propagating in a spherical shell when viscosity tends to zero. We identify
three kinds of eigenmodes whose eigenvalues follow very different laws as the
Ekman number $E$ becomes very small. First are modes associated with attractors
of characteristics that are made of thin shear layers closely following the
periodic orbit traced by the characteristic attractor. Second are modes made of
shear layers that connect the critical latitude singularities of the two
hemispheres of the inner boundary of the spherical shell. Third are
quasi-regular modes associated with the frequency of neutral periodic orbits of
characteristics. We thoroughly analyse a subset of attractor modes for which
numerical solutions point to an asymptotic law governing the eigenvalues. We
show that three length scales proportional to $E^{1/6}$, $E^{1/4}$ and
$E^{1/3}$ control the shape of the shear layers that are associated with these
modes. These scales point out the key role of the small parameter $E^{1/12}$ in
these oscillatory flows. With a simplified model of the viscous Poincar\'e
equation, we can give an approximate analytical formula that reproduces the
velocity field in such shear layers. Finally, we also present an analysis of
the quasi-regular modes whose frequencies are close to $\sin(\pi/4)$ and
explain why a fluid inside a spherical shell cannot respond to any periodic
forcing at this frequency when viscosity vanishes.

occurred simultaneously at two neighbouring vents. In the following weeks,
eruptive activity led to the build-up of two cones, tens of meters high, here
named Crater N and Crater S. To characterize the short-term (days) dynamics of
this multi-vent system, we performed a multi-parametric investigation by means
of a dense instrumental network. The experimental setup, deployed on July
15-16th at ca. 300 m from the eruption site, comprised two broadband
seismometers and three microphones as well as high speed video and thermal
cameras. Thermal analyses enabled us to characterize the style of eruptive
activity at each vent. In particular, explosive activity at Crater N featured
higher thermal amplitudes and a lower explosion frequency than at Crater S.
Several episodes of switching between puffing and Strombolian activity were
noted at Crater S through both visual observation and thermal data; oppositely,
Crater N exhibited a quasi-periodic activity. The quantification of the
eruptive style of each vent enabled us to infer the geometry of the eruptive

the most inclined conduit (i.e. Crater S). Accordingly, we were able to
correctly interpret acoustic data and thereby extend the characterization of
this twovent system.

probabilistic framework based on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)
for word-level and sentence-level ASL translation respectively. To evaluate its

are structured as balanced batches (one image per class), and inference is also
carried out on balanced test batches, using the batch's own means and
variances, then the conditional results will improve considerably. The network
uses the strong information about easy images in a balanced batch, and
propagates it through the shared means and variances to help decide the
identity of harder images on the same batch. Balancing the test batches
requires the labels of the test images, which are not available in practice,
however further investigation can be done using batch structures that are less
strict and might not require the test image labels. The conditional results
show the error rate almost reduced to zero for nontrivial datasets with small

indeed suggest that cross-entropy is an optimal learning objective for such a
task in the limit of infinite data. In the context of limited and noisy data
however, the use of a loss function that is specifically designed for top-k

suggests that the loss function must be smooth and have non-sparse gradients in
order to work well with deep neural networks. Consequently, we introduce a
family of smoothed loss functions that are suited to top-k optimization via
deep learning. The widely used cross-entropy is a special case of our family.
Evaluating our smooth loss functions is computationally challenging: a na\""ive
algorithm would require $\mathcal{O}(\binom{n}{k})$ operations, where n is the
number of classes. Thanks to a connection to polynomial algebra and a
divide-and-conquer approach, we provide an algorithm with a time complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(k n)$. Furthermore, we present a novel approximation to obtain
fast and stable algorithms on GPUs with single floating point precision. We
compare the performance of the cross-entropy loss and our margin-based losses

one of the possible choices is to approximate the interface variational space
by Fourier basis functions. As we show in the numerical simulations, our
approach is well-suited for the solution of problems with non-conforming meshes
or with finite element basis functions with different polynomial degrees in
each subdomain. Another application of the method that still needs to be
investigated is the coupling of solutions obtained from otherwise incompatible
methods, such as the finite element method, the spectral element method or
isogeometric analysis.

velocimetry measurements in the rotating frame, we show that the wake is
stabilized by rotation for Reynolds number ${\rm Re}=Ud/\nu$ much larger than
in a non-rotating fluid. Over the explored range of parameters, the limit of
stability is ${\rm Re} \simeq (275 \pm 25) / {\rm Ro}$, with ${\rm
Ro}=U/2\Omega d$ the Rossby number, indicating that the stabilizing process is
governed by the Ekman pumping in the boundary layer. At low Rossby number, the
wake takes the form of a stationary pattern of inertial waves, similar to the
wake of surface gravity waves behind a ship. We compare this steady wake
pattern to a model, originally developed by [Johnson, J. Fluid Mech. 120, 359
(1982)], assuming a free-slip boundary condition and a weak streamwise
perturbation. Our measurements show a quantitative agreement with this model
for ${\rm Ro}\lesssim 0.3$. At larger Rossby number, the phase pattern of the
wake is close to the prediction for an infinitely small line object. However,
the wake amplitude and phase origin are not correctly described by the
weak-streamwise-perturbation model, calling for an alternative model for the
boundary condition at moderate rotation rate.

estimation. In this paper we propose an abstract framework, learning to
synthesis, or L2S in short, to address this problem. L2S combines four tools to
achieve this: syntax is used to define the search space and search steps,
constraints are used to prune off invalid candidates at each search step,
machine-learned models are used to estimate conditional probabilities for the
candidates at each search step, and search algorithms are used to find the best
possible solution. The main goal of L2S is to lay out the design space to
motivate the research on program estimation.

bias parameter can be estimated from the large scale limit of the halo-matter
power spectrum, and the second order bias parameters from the large scale,
tree-level, bispectrum. Cubic operators would naturally be quantified using the
tree-level trispectrum. As the latter is computationally expensive, we extent
the quadratic field method proposed in Schmittfull et al. 2014 to cubic fields
in order to estimate cubic bias parameters. We cross-correlate a basis set of
cubic bias operators with the halo field and express the result in terms of the
cross-spectra of these operators in order to cancel cosmic variance. We obtain
significant detections of local and non-local cubic bias parameters, which are
partially in tension with predictions based on local Lagrangian bias schemes.
We directly measure the Lagrangian bias parameters of the protohaloes
associated with our halo sample and clearly detect a non-local quadratic term
in Lagrangian space. We do not find a clear detection of non-local cubic
Lagrangian terms for low mass bins, but there is some mild evidence for their
presence for the highest mass bin. While the method presented here focuses on
cubic bias parameters, the approach could also be applied to quantifications of
cubic primordial non-Gaussianity.

correctly fits the regions together and generates a map projection for every

channels that galaxies are prone to follow in the rest-frame NUVrK colour
diagram, as identified by Moutard et al. (2016b). Namely, the fast quenching
channel followed by $young$ low-mass galaxies and the slow quenching channel
followed by $old$ high-mass ones. We make use of the >22 deg$^2$ covered the
VIPERS Multi-Lambda Survey (VIPERS-MLS) to select a galaxy sample complete down
to stellar masses of $M_* > 10^{9.4} M_\odot$ at $z < 0.65$ ($M_* > 10^{8.8}
M_\odot$ at $z < 0.5$) and including 33,500 (43,000) quiescent galaxies
properly selected at $0.2 < z < 0.65$, while being characterized by reliable
photometric redshifts ($\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z)} \leq 0.04$) that we use to
measure galaxy local densities. We find that (1) the quiescence of low-mass
[$M_* \leq 10^{9.7} M_\odot$] galaxies requires a strong increase of the local
density, which confirms the lead role played by environment in their fast
quenching and, therefore, confirms that the low-mass upturn observed in the
stellar mass function of quiescent galaxies is due to $environmental$
$quenching$. We also observe that (2) the reservoir of low-mass star-forming
galaxies located in very dense regions (prone to environmental quenching) has
grown between $z \sim 0.6$ and $ z \sim 0.4$ whilst the share of low-mass
quiescent galaxies (expected to being environmentally quenched) may have
simultaneously increased, which would plead for a rising importance of
$environmental$ $quenching$ with cosmic time, compared to $mass$ $quenching$.
We finally discuss the composite picture of such environmental quenching of
low-mass galaxies and, in particular, how this picture may be consistent with a
$delayed$-$then$-$rapid$ quenching scenario.

a family of heterogeneous ensembles is built by pooling classifiers from M

variability study of a large sample of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) observed
with the Kepler/K2 mission. The sample contains 252 AGN observed over four
campaigns with $\sim 30$ minute cadence selected from the Million Quasar
Catalogue with R magnitude $< 19$. We performed time series analysis to
determine their variability properties by means of the power spectral densities
(PSDs) and applied Monte Carlo techniques to find the best model parameters
that fit the observed power spectra. A power-law model is sufficient to
describe all the PSDs of our sample. A variety of power-law slopes were found
indicating that there is not a universal slope for all AGN. We find that the
rest-frame amplitude variability in the frequency range of
$6\times10^{-6}-10^{-4}$ Hz varies from $1-10$ % with an average of 1.7 %. We
explore correlations between the variability amplitude and key parameters of
the AGN, finding a significant correlation of rest-frame short-term variability
amplitude with redshift. We attribute this effect to the known ""bluer when
brighter"" variability of quasars combined with the fixed bandpass of Kepler
data. This study also enables us to distinguish between Seyferts and Blazars
and confirm AGN candidates. For our study we have compared results obtained
from light curves extracted using different aperture sizes and with and without
de-trending. We find that limited de-trending of the optimal photometric
precision light curve is the best approach, although some systematic effects
still remain present.

But nobody has yet unambiguously demonstrated where the Schott energy actually
lies in the fields. By scrutinizing electromagnetic fields of a uniformly

the ideas prevalent in the literature, there is no evidence of any

inter-class distances are increased to facilitate discriminative learning.
Moreover, the proposed DA method sparsely regresses class labels from the
features achieved in the shared subspace while minimizing the prediction errors
on the source data and ensuring label consistency between source and target.
Data outliers are also accounted for to further avoid negative knowledge
transfer. Comprehensive experiments and in-depth analysis verify the

one traditional approach to theory reduction in physics, founded on the notion

whereby one theory encompasses the domain of empirical validity of another. I
defend an alternative account that builds upon a certain general type of
relationship between dynamical systems models describing the same physical
system. I demonstrate how this particular relationship resembles the
methodological prescriptions set out by Ernest Nagel's more general approach to
reduction across the sciences.
  After clarifying these points of general methodology, I go on to apply this
approach to a number of particular inter-theory reductions in physics involving
quantum theory. I consider three reductions: first, connecting classical
mechanics and non-relativistic quantum mechanics; second, connecting classical
electrodynamics and quantum electrodynamics; and third, connecting
non-relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics. In all cases, a
certain core set of mechanisms, employing decoherence together with variations
of Ehrenfest's Theorem, serves to underwrite the occurrence of approximately
classical behavior. For concreteness, I consider two particular realist
interpretations of quantum theory - the Everett and Bohm theories - as
potential bases for these reductions. However, many of the technical results
concerning these reductions pertain also more generally to the bare,
uninterpreted formalism of quantum theory.

comb which has been running mode locked for the past one year without any need
to redo the mode locking. By using the free-space NPR comb scheme, we have not
only shortened the cavity length, but also have obtained 5 to 10 times higher
output power (more than 30 mW at central wavelength of 1570 nm) and much
broader spectral comb bandwidth (about 54 nm) compared to conventional
all-fiber cavity structure with less than 1 mW average output power and only 10
nm spectral bandwidth. The pulse output from the NPR comb is amplified through
a 1 m long EDF, then compressed by a length of anomalous dispersion fiber to a
near transform limited pulse duration. The amplified transform limited pulse,
with an average power of 180 mW and pulse duration of 70 fs, is used to
generate a supercontinuum of 140 mW. SC generation via propagation in HNLF is
optimized for specific polling period and heating temperature of PPLN crystal
for SHG around 1030 nm.

  for Correlated Massive MIMO Systems",,,,,"eess.SP cs.AR cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In massive MIMO (M-MIMO) systems, one of the key challenges in the
implementation is the large-scale matrix inversion operation, as widely used in
channel estimation, equalization, detection, and decoding procedures.
Traditionally, to handle this complexity issue, several low-complexity matrix
inversion approximation methods have been proposed, including the classic
Cholesky decomposition and the Neumann series expansion (NSE). However, the
conventional approaches failed to exploit neither the special structure of
channel matrices nor the critical issues in the hardware implementation, which
results in poorer throughput performance and longer processing delay. In this
paper, by targeting at the correlated M-MIMO systems, we propose a modified NSE
based on tridiagonal matrix inversion approximation (TMA) to accommodate the
complexity as well as the performance issue in the conventional hardware
implementation, and analyze the corresponding approximation errors. Meanwhile,
we investigate the VLSI implementation for the proposed detection algorithm
based on a Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7VX690T FPGA platform. It is shown that for
correlated massive MIMO systems, it can achieve near-MMSE performance and $630$
Mb/s throughput. Compared with other benchmark systems, the proposed pipelined
TMA detector can get high throughput-to-hardware ratio. Finally, we also
propose a fast iteration structure for further research.

8799 multi-planet system from the Submillimeter Array to complement archival
ALMA observations that spatially filtered away the bulk of the emission. The
image morphology at $3.8$ arcsecond (150 AU) resolution indicates an optically
thin circumstellar belt, which we associate with a population of dust-producing
planetesimals within the debris disk. The interferometric visibilities are fit
well by an axisymmetric radial power-law model characterized by a broad width,
$\Delta R/R\gtrsim 1$. The belt inclination and orientation parameters are
consistent with the planet orbital parameters within the mutual uncertainties.
The models constrain the radial location of the inner edge of the belt to
$R_\text{in}= 104_{-12}^{+8}$ AU. In a simple scenario where the chaotic zone
of the outermost planet b truncates the planetesimal distribution, this inner
edge location translates into a constraint on the planet~b mass of $M_\text{pl}
= 5.8_{-3.1}^{+7.9}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. This mass estimate is consistent with
infrared observations of the planet luminosity and standard hot-start
evolutionary models, with the uncertainties allowing for a range of initial
conditions. We also present new 9 millimeter observations of the debris disk
from the Very Large Array and determine a millimeter spectral index of
$2.41\pm0.17$. This value is typical of debris disks and indicates a power-law
index of the grain size distribution $q=3.27\pm0.10$, close to predictions for
a classical collisional cascade.

computed tomography angiography (CTA) images, which lead to overestimation of

coronary calcification and restore arterial lumen precisely, we propose a
machine learning-based method with a multi-step inpainting process. We
developed a new network configuration, Dense-Unet, to achieve optimal
performance with low computational cost. Results after the calcium removal
process were validated by comparing with gold-standard X-ray angiography. Our
results demonstrated that removing coronary calcification from images with the
proposed approach was feasible, and may potentially improve the diagnostic

Cramer-Lundberg risk model. The claims can be of different types and can arrive
in groups. The groups arrival processes within a type have constant
intensities. The counting groups processes are dependent multivariate compound
Poisson processes of type I. We allow empty groups and show that in that case
we can find stochastically equivalent Cramer-Lundberg model with non-empty
groups.
  The investigated model generalizes the risk model with common shocks, the
Poisson risk process of order k, the Poisson negative binomial, the
Polya-Aeppli, the Polya-Aeppli of order k among others. All of them with one or
more types of polices.
  The relations between the numerical characteristics and distributions of the
components of the risk processes are proven to be corollaries of the
corresponding formulae of the Cramer-Lundberg risk model.

  on Social Media",,,,,"cs.CY cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domestic Violence against women is now recognized to be a serious and
widespread problem worldwide. Domestic Violence and Abuse is at the root of so
many issues in society and considered as the societal tabooed topic.
Fortunately, with the popularity of social media, social welfare communities
and victim support groups facilitate the victims to share their abusive stories
and allow others to give advice and help victims. Hence, in order to offer the
immediate resources for those needs, the specific messages from the victims
need to be alarmed from other messages. In this paper, we regard intention
mining as a binary classification problem (abuse or advice) with the usecase of
abuse discourse. To address this problem, we extract rich feature sets from the
raw corpus, using psycholinguistic clues and textual features by term-class
interaction method. Machine learning algorithms are used to predict the
accuracy of the classifiers between two different feature sets. Our
experimental results with high classification accuracy give a promising
solution to understand a big social problem through big social media and its
use in serving information needs of various community welfare organizations.
