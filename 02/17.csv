$\mathcal{O}$-\emph{sees} $q$ if there is an $\mathcal{O}$-\emph{staircase}

of the polygon $P$, denoted by $\mathcal{O}$-${\rm Kernel }(P)$, is the subset
of points which $\mathcal{O}$-see all the other points in $P$. This work
initiates the study of the computation and maintenance of $\mathcal{O}$-${\rm

$\mathcal{O}$-${\rm Kernel }_{\theta}(P)$. In particular, we consider the case
when the set $\mathcal{O}$ is formed by either one or two orthogonal
orientations, $\mathcal{O}=\{0^\circ\}$ or $\mathcal{O}=\{0^\circ,90^\circ\}$.
For these cases and $P$ being a simple polygon, we design efficient algorithms
for computing and maintaining the $\mathcal{O}$-${\rm Kernel }_{\theta}(P)$
while $\theta$ varies in $[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$, obtaining the
angular intervals where: (i) $\mathcal{O}$-${\rm Kernel }_{\theta}(P)$ is not

quasi-static noise are the major contributors to memory dephasing induced by
the entangling sequence. These insights enable us to demonstrate a 19-fold
improved memory performance which is still not limited by the electron

the spin-flip channels during the optical electron spin reset. We find that
spin-flips occur via decay from the meta-stable singlet states with a branching

ultra-cold gases and nuclear physics in the context of the BCS-BEC crossover.
The BCS-BEC crossover has recently been realized experimentally, and
essentially in all of its aspects, with ultra-cold Fermi gases. This
realization, in turn, has raised the interest of the nuclear physics community
in the crossover problem, since it represents an unprecedented tool to test
fundamental and unanswered questions of nuclear many-body theory. Here, we
focus on the several aspects of the BCS-BEC crossover, which are of broad joint
interest to both ultra-cold Fermi gases and nuclear matter, and which will
likely help to solve in the future some open problems in nuclear physics
(concerning, for instance, neutron stars). Similarities and differences
occurring in ultra-cold Fermi gases and nuclear matter will then be emphasized,
not only about the relative phenomenologies but also about the theoretical
approaches to be used in the two contexts. After an introduction to present the
key concepts of the BCS-BEC crossover, this report discusses the mean-field
treatment of the superfluid phase, both for homogeneous and inhomogeneous
systems, as well as for symmetric (spin- or isospin-balanced) and asymmetric
(spin- or isospin-imbalanced) matter. Pairing fluctuations in the normal phase
are then considered, with their manifestations in thermodynamic and dynamic
quantities. The last two Sections provide a more specialized discussion of the
BCS-BEC crossover in ultra-cold Fermi gases and nuclear matter, respectively.
The separate discussion in the two contexts aims at cross communicating to both
communities topics and aspects which, albeit arising in one of the two fields,
share a strong common interest.

detection of atrial fibrillation, other arrhythmia and noise on short single
lead ECG signals, emphasizing the importance of the interpretability of the
classification results.
  Approach: A morphological and rhythm description of the cardiac behavior is
obtained by a knowledge-based interpretation of the signal using the
\textit{Construe} abductive framework. Then, a set of meaningful features are
extracted for each individual heartbeat and as a summary of the full record.
The feature distributions were used to elucidate the expert criteria underlying
the labeling of the 2017 Physionet/CinC Challenge dataset, enabling a manual
partial relabeling to improve the consistency of the classification rules.
Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are combined to provide an
answer on the basis of the feature values.
  Main results: The proposal tied for the first place in the official stage of
the Challenge, with a combined $F_1$ score of 0.83, and was even improved in
the follow-up stage to 0.85 with a significant simplification of the model.
  Significance: This approach demonstrates the potential of \textit{Construe}
to provide robust and valuable descriptions of temporal data even with
significant amounts of noise and artifacts. Also, we discuss the importance of
a consistent classification criteria in manually labeled training datasets, and
the fundamental advantages of knowledge-based approaches to formalize and
validate that criteria.

circuit consists of a sequence of parameter dependent unitary transformations
which acts on an input quantum state. For binary classification a single Pauli
operator is measured on a designated readout qubit. The measured output is the
quantum neural network's predictor of the binary label of the input state.
First we look at classifying classical data sets which consist of n-bit strings
with binary labels. The input quantum state is an n-bit computational basis
state corresponding to a sample string. We show how to design a circuit made
from two qubit unitaries that can correctly represent the label of any Boolean
function of n bits. For certain label functions the circuit is exponentially
long. We introduce parameter dependent unitaries that can be adapted by
supervised learning of labeled data. We study an example of real world data
consisting of downsampled images of handwritten digits each of which has been
labeled as one of two distinct digits. We show through classical simulation
that parameters can be found that allow the QNN to learn to correctly
distinguish the two data sets. We then discuss presenting the data as quantum
superpositions of computational basis states corresponding to different label
values. Here we show through simulation that learning is possible. We consider
using our QNN to learn the label of a general quantum state. By example we show
that this can be done. Our work is exploratory and relies on the classical
simulation of small quantum systems. The QNN proposed here was designed with
near-term quantum processors in mind. Therefore it will be possible to run this
QNN on a near term gate model quantum computer where its power can be explored
beyond what can be explored with simulation.

achieve three effects: (1) high balancedness -- achieving comparable
performance on both frequent and infrequent classes; (2) high compactness --
using a small number of projection vectors to achieve a ""good"" metric; (3) good
generalizability -- alleviating overfitting to training data. While showing
promising results, these approaches suffer three problems. First, they involve
solving non-convex optimization problems where achieving the global optimal is
NP-hard. Second, it lacks a theoretical understanding why OPR can lead to
balancedness. Third, the current generalization error analysis of OPR is not

(1) seeking convex relaxations of the original nonconvex problems so that the
global optimal is guaranteed to be achievable; (2) providing a formal analysis

networks were reconstructed using EEG source connectivity computed in different

depending on an elliptic curve $E$ and a point $\tau \in E$ that is not
4-torsion. The present paper is concerned with the structure of $A$ when $\tau$
is a point of finite order, $n$ say. It is proved that every simple $A$-module
has dimension $\le n$ and that ""almost all"" have dimension precisely $n$. There
are enough finite dimensional simple modules to separate elements of $A$; that
is, if $0\ne a \in A$, then there exists a simple module $S$ such that $a.S \ne
0.$ Consequently $A$ satisfies a polynomial identity of degree $2n$ (and none
of lower degree). Combined with results of Levasseur and Stafford it follows
that $A$ is a finite module over its center. Therefore one may associate to $A$
a coherent sheaf, ${\mathcal A}$ say, of finite ${\mathcal O}_S$ algebras where
$S$ is the projective 3-fold determined by the center of $A$. We determine
where ${\mathcal A}$ is Azumaya, and prove that the division algebra ${\rm
Fract}({\mathcal A})$ has rational center. Thus, for each $E$ and each $\tau

the rational function field of ${\mathbb P}^3$, where $s=n$ if $n$ is odd, and
$s={{1} \over {2}} n$ if $n$ is even.
  The main technical tool in the paper is the notion of a ""fat point""

  Depending on the chosen cost function $\mu$, we find that different
algorithmic approaches can be applied to design FPT-algorithms: for arbitrary
$\mu$ we parameterized by the number of edges that cross the cut (not the cost)
and show how to solve ZERO EXTENSION in time $O(|D|^{O(k^2)} n^4 \log n)$ using
randomized contractions. We improve this running time with respect to both
parameter and input size to $O(|D|^{O(k)} m)$ in the case where $\mu$ is a
metric. We further show that the problem admits a polynomial sparsifier, that
is, a kernel of size $O(k^{|D|+1})$ that is independent of the metric $\mu$.
  With the stronger condition that $\mu$ is described by the distances of
leaves in a tree, we parameterize by a gap parameter $(q - p)$ between the cost
of a true solution $q$ and a `discrete relaxation' $p$ and achieve a running
time of $O(|D|^{q-p} |T|m + |T|\phi(n,m))$ where $T$ is the size of the tree

distribution network is a prerequisite for solving any grid optimization task.
Although distribution grids lack observability and comprehensive metering,
inverters with advanced cyber capabilities currently interface solar panels and
energy storage devices to the grid. Smart inverters have been widely used for
grid control and optimization, yet the fresh idea here is to engage them
towards network topology inference. Being an electric circuit, a distribution
grid can be intentionally probed by instantaneously perturbing inverter
injections. Collecting and processing the incurred voltage deviations across
nodes can potentially unveil the grid topology even without knowing loads.
Using grid probing data and under an approximate grid model, the tasks of
topology recovery and line status verification are posed respectively as
non-convex estimation and detection problems. Leveraging the features of the
Laplacian matrix of a tree graph, probing terminal nodes is analytically shown
to be sufficient for exact topology recovery if voltage data are collected at
all buses. The related non-convex problems are surrogated to convex ones, which
are iteratively solved via closed-form updates based on the alternating
direction method of multipliers and projected gradient descent. Numerical tests
on benchmark feeders demonstrate that grid probing can yield line status error
probabilities of 0.001 by probing 40% of the nodes.

it is uniquely solvable up to gauge solutions, given initial data on a

initial data (modulo gauge producing initial data) and solutions (modulo gauge
solutions). In the first part of this work, we show that the solution map is
actually an isomorphism of locally convex topological vector spaces. This

equivalence class of initial data. We may therefore conclude well-posedness of
the Cauchy problem. In the second part, we show that the linearised constraint
equations can always be solved on a closed manifold with vanishing scalar

quantum magic can appear. Only recently has it been discovered that strong

transitions, conductivity, chemical reactions, etc. This review addresses the
fundamentals of this opportunity: the quantum mechanical foundations, the

nonlinear optics and chemical reactivity. Ultimately, revealing the interplay

that will operate 4850 feet underground at the Sanford Underground Research

with an active mass of 7~tonnes, LZ will search primarily for low-energy
interactions with Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which are
hypothesized to make up the dark matter in our galactic halo. In this paper,
the projected WIMP sensitivity of LZ is presented based on the latest
background estimates and simulations of the detector. For a 1000~live day run
using a 5.6~tonne fiducial mass, LZ is projected to exclude at 90\% confidence
level spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections above $1.4 \times
10^{-48}$~cm$^{2}$ for a 40~$\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}$ mass WIMP. Additionally, a
$5\sigma$ discovery potential is projected reaching cross sections below the
exclusion limits of recent experiments. For spin-dependent
WIMP-neutron(-proton) scattering, a sensitivity of $2.3 \times
10^{-43}$~cm$^{2}$ ($7.1 \times 10^{-42}$~cm$^{2}$) for a
40~$\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}$ mass WIMP is expected. With underground installation
well underway, LZ is on track for commissioning at SURF in 2020.

multiscale scan statistics apply different standardizations at each scale, and
the limiting distribution under the null hypothesis---that the data is only

the case study of 1H 1934-063 (z = 0.0102), a Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1)
among the brightest and most variable AGN ever observed with XMM-Newton. This
work includes spectral and temporal analyses of a concurrent XMM-Newton and
NuSTAR 2015 observation lasting 130 kiloseconds, during which the X-ray source
exhibited a steep (factor of 6) plummet and subsequent full recovery of flux
level, accompanied by deviation from a single log-normal flux distribution. We
rule out Compton-thin obscuration as the cause for this dramatic variability
observed even at NuSTAR energies. In order to constrain coronal geometry,
dynamics, and emission/absorption processes, we compare detailed spectral
fitting with Fourier-based timing analysis. Similar to other well-studied,
highly variable Seyfert 1s, this AGN is X-ray bright and displays strong
reflection features. We find a narrower broad iron line component compared to
most Seyfert 1s, and constrain black hole spin to be < 0.1, one of the lowest

preferred. We often stream the high-quality content within current viewport,
while reducing the quality of representation elsewhere to save the network

on a new FoV, in this paper, we model the perceptual impact of the quality
variations (through adapting the quantization stepsize and spatial resolution)

exponential functions that well explain the joint quantization and resolution
induced quality impact. Analytical model is cross-validated using another set
of data, where both Pearson and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients are

neural networks for large-scale datasets often requires distributed training

frequently communicate gradients, causing severe bottlenecks, especially on
lower bandwidth connections. A few methods have been proposed to compress
gradient for efficient communication, but they either suffer a low compression
ratio or significantly harm the resulting model accuracy, particularly when
applied to convolutional neural networks. To address these issues, we propose a
method to reduce the communication overhead of distributed deep learning. Our
key observation is that gradient updates can be delayed until an unambiguous
(high amplitude, low variance) gradient has been calculated. We also present an
efficient algorithm to compute the variance with negligible additional cost. We
experimentally show that our method can achieve very high compression ratio
while maintaining the result model accuracy. We also analyze the efficiency
using computation and communication cost models and provide the evidence that
this method enables distributed deep learning for many scenarios with commodity
environments.

(EVs) from a cooperative perspective in an EV system. First, the concept of
cooperative EV-to-EV (V2V) charging is introduced, which enables active
cooperation via charging/discharging operations between EVs as energy consumers
and EVs as energy providers. Then, based on the cooperative V2V charging
concept, a flexible energy management protocol with different V2V matching
algorithms is proposed, which can help the EVs achieve more flexible and
smarter charging/discharging behaviors. In the proposed energy management
protocol, we define the utilities of the EVs based on the cost and profit
through cooperative V2V charging and employ the bipartite graph to model the
charging/discharging cooperation between EVs as energy consumers and EVs as
energy providers. Based on the constructed bipartite graph, a max-weight V2V
matching algorithm is proposed in order to optimize the network social welfare.
Moreover, taking individual rationality into consideration, we further
introduce the stable matching concepts and propose two stable V2V matching
algorithms, which can yield the EV-consumer-optimal and EV-provider-optimal
stable V2V matchings, respectively. Simulation results verify the efficiency of
our proposed cooperative V2V charging based energy management protocol in
improving the EV utilities and the network social welfare as well as reducing
the energy consumption of the EVs.

label constraints, a fundamental challenge is to nd the top-k matches ac-
cording to a ranking function over edge and node weights. For users, it is di
cult to select value k . We therefore propose the novel notion of an any-k
ranking algorithm: for a given time budget, re- turn as many of the top-ranked
results as possible. Then, given additional time, produce the next lower-ranked
results quickly as well. It can be stopped anytime, but may have to continues
until all results are returned. This paper focuses on acyclic patterns over
arbitrary labeled graphs. We are interested in practical algorithms that
effectively exploit (1) properties of heterogeneous networks, in particular
selective constraints on labels, and (2) that the users often explore only a

aggressive pruning that leverages the acyclic nature of the query, and
incremental guided search. It enables us to prove strong non-trivial time and

imprints a damping wing absorption feature on the spectrum of high-redshift

significantly neutral Universe, and enables measurements of the hydrogen
neutral fraction $x_{\rm HI}(z)$ at that epoch. Obtaining reliable quantitative
constraints from this technique, however, is challenging due to stochasticity
induced by the patchy inside-out topology of reionization, degeneracies with
quasar lifetime, and the unknown unabsorbed quasar spectrum close to rest-frame
Ly$\alpha$. We combine a large-volume semi-numerical simulation of reionization
topology with 1D radiative transfer through high-resolution hydrodynamical
simulations of the high-redshift Universe to construct models of quasar
transmission spectra during reionization. Our state-of-the-art approach
captures the distribution of damping wing strengths in biased quasar halos that
should have reionized earlier, as well as the erosion of neutral gas in the
quasar environment caused by its own ionizing radiation. Combining this
detailed model with our new technique for predicting the quasar continuum and
its associated uncertainty, we introduce a Bayesian statistical method to
jointly constrain the neutral fraction of the Universe and the quasar lifetime
from individual quasar spectra. We apply this methodology to the spectra of the
two highest redshift quasars known, ULAS J1120+0641 and ULAS J1342+0928, and
measured volume-averaged neutral fractions $\langle x_{\rm HI}

evolution and to test different neutron star crust cooling scenarios. Aql X-1
is an ideal test source for this purpose, because it shows frequent, short

outburst roughly once a year for a few months.
  Assuming that the quiescent {\it Swift}/XRT observations of Aql X-1 can be
explained within the crust cooling scenario (Waterhouse et al. 2016), we find
three main conclusions. Firstly, the data are well reproduced by our model if
the envelope composition and shallow heating parameters are allowed to change
between outbursts. This is not the case if both shallow heating parameters
(strength and depth) are tied throughout all accretion episodes, supporting
earlier results that the properties of the shallow heating mechanism are not
constant between outbursts. Second, from our models shallow heating could not
be connected to one specific spectral state during outburst. Third, and most
importantly, we find that the neutron star in Aql X-1 does not have enough time

early-type galaxies depends on their host environment. To this purpose, we have
selected a sample of early-type galaxies from the SPIDER catalogue,
characterized their environment through the group catalogue of Wang et al. and
used their optical SDSS spectra to constrain the IMF slope, through the
analysis of IMF-sensitive spectral indices. To reach a high enough
signal-to-noise ratio, we have stacked spectra in velocity dispersion
($\sigma_0$) bins, on top of separating the sample by galaxy hierarchy and host
halo mass, as proxies for galaxy environment. In order to constrain the IMF, we
have compared observed line strengths to predictions of MIUSCAT/EMILES
synthetic stellar population models, with varying age, metallicity, and
""bimodal"" (low-mass tapered) IMF slope ($\rm \Gamma_b$). Consistent with
previous studies, we find that $\rm \Gamma_b$ increases with $\sigma_0$,
becoming bottom-heavy (i.e. an excess of low-mass stars with respect to the
Milky-Way-like IMF) at high $\sigma_0$. We find that this result is robust
against the set of isochrones used in the stellar population models, as well as
the way the effect of elemental abundance ratios is taken into account. We thus
conclude that it is possible to use currently state-of-the-art stellar
population models and intermediate resolution spectra to consistently probe IMF
variations. For the first time, we show that there is no dependence of
$\Gamma_b$ on environment or galaxy hierarchy, as measured within the $3""$ SDSS
fibre, thus leaving the IMF as an intrinsic galaxy property, possibly set
already at high redshift.

this map to general AdS and asymptotically flat solutions. A prime application
for such map would be the development of holography for Minkowski spacetime. In
this paper we perform a Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction of AdS on a torus and of
Minkowski on a sphere, keeping all massive KK modes. Such computation is
interesting on its own, as there are relatively few examples of such explicit
KK reductions in the literature. We perform both KK reductions in parallel to
illustrate their similarity. In particular, we show how to construct gauge
invariant variables, find the field equations they satisfy, and construct a
corresponding effective action. We further diagonalize all equations and find
their general solution in closed form. Surprisingly, in the limit of large

of massive stars. Their photospheric convection may play an important role in
the launching mechanism of their mass loss; however, its characteristics and
dynamics are still poorly constrained. Aims. By observing red supergiant stars
with near infrared interferometry at different epochs, we expect to reveal the
evolution of bright convective features on their stellar surface. Methods. We
observed the M2Iab-Ib red supergiant star CE Tau with the VLTI/PIONIER
instrument in the H band at two different epochs separated by one month.
Results. We derive the angular diameter of the star and basic stellar
parameters, and reconstruct two reliable images of its H-band photosphere. The
contrast of the convective pattern of the reconstructed images is $5 \pm 1 \%$
and $6 \pm 1 \%$ for our two epochs of observation. Conclusions. The stellar
photosphere shows few changes between the two epochs. The contrast of the
convective pattern is below the average contrast variations obtained on 30
randomly chosen snapshots of the best matching 3D radiative hydrodynamics
simulation: $23 \pm 1~\%$ for the original simulation images and $16 \pm 1~\%$
for the maps degraded to the reconstruction resolution. We offer two hypotheses
to explain this observation. CE Tau may be experiencing a quiet convective
activity episode or it could be a consequence of its warmer effective
temperature (hence its smaller radius) compared to the simulation.

background curvature and electromagnetic fields. The main players are, on the
one hand, a massive complex $|\phi|^4$ scalar field coupled to a $U(1)$
Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge field at level $1$, representing a relativistic
composite boson with one unit of attached flux, and on the other hand, a
massive Dirac fermion. We show that, in a curved background and at the level of
the partition function, the relativistic composite boson, in the infinite
coupling limit, is dual to a short-range interacting Dirac fermion. The
coupling to the gravitational spin connection arises naturally from the spin
factors of the Wilson loop in the Chern-Simons theory. A non-minimal coupling
to the scalar curvature is included on the bosonic side in order to obtain
agreement between partition functions. Although an explicit Lagrangian
expression for the fermionic interactions is not obtained, their short-range
nature constrains them to be irrelevant, which protects the duality in its
strong interpretation as an exact mapping at the IR fixed point between a
Wilson-Fischer-Chern-Simons complex scalar and a free Dirac fermion. We also
show that, even away from the IR, keeping the $|\phi|^4$ term is of key
importance as it provides the short-range bosonic interactions necessary to
prevent intersections of worldlines in the path integral, thus forbidding
unknotting of knots and ensuring preservation of the worldline topologies.

complexity of $\#_p\mathsf{H}$OMS$\mathsf{T}$O$H$, the problem of counting
graph homomorphisms from an input graph to a graph $H$ modulo a prime number
$p$. Dyer and Greenhill proved a dichotomy stating that the tractability of
non-modular counting graph homomorphisms depends on the structure of the input
graph. Many intractable cases in non-modular counting become tractable in
modular counting due to the common phenomenon of cancellation. However, in
subsequent studies on counting modulo $2$ the influence, the structure of $H$
has on the tractability, was shown to persist, yielding similar dichotomies.
  Our main result shows that for every tree $H$ and every prime $p$ the problem
$\#_p\mathsf{H}$OMS$\mathsf{T}$O$H$ is either polynomial time computable or
$\#_p\mathsf{P}$-complete. This addresses the conjecture of Faben and Jerrum
stating this dichotomy for every graph $H$ when counting modulo 2. In order to
prove this result, we study the structural properties of a homomorphism. As an
important interim, this study yields a dichotomy for the problem of weighted
counting independent sets in a bipartite graph modulo some prime $p$. Our
results are the first suggesting that such dichotomies hold not only for the
one-bit functions of the modulo~2 case but for the modular counting functions
of all primes $p$.

For a sequence $R_n \to \infty$, we define these graphs to have the vertex set
as Poisson points distributed uniformly in balls $B(0,R_n) \subset
B_d^{\alpha}$, the $d$-dimensional Poincar\'e ball (unit d-ball with the
Poincar\'e metric $d_{\alpha}$ corresponding to negative curvature $-\alpha^2,
\alpha > 0$) by connecting any two points within a distance $R_n$ according to
the metric $d_{\zeta}, \zeta > 0$. Denoting these graphs by $HG_n(R_n ; \alpha,
\zeta)$, we study asymptotic counts of copies of a fixed tree $\Gamma_k$ (with
the ordered degree sequence $d_{(1)} \leq \ldots \leq d_{(k)}$) in $HG_n(R_n ;
\alpha, \zeta)$. Unlike earlier works, we count more involved structures,
allowing for $d > 2$, and in many places, more general choices of $R_n$ rather
than $R_n = 2[\zeta (d-1)]^{-1}\log (n/ \nu), \nu \in (0,\infty)$. The latter
choice of $R_n$ for $\alpha / \zeta > 1/2$ corresponds to the thermodynamic
regime. We show multiple phase transitions in $HG_n(R_n ; \alpha, \zeta)$ as
$\alpha / \zeta$ increases, i.e., the space $B_d^{\alpha}$ becomes more
hyperbolic. In particular, our analyses reveal that the sub-tree counts exhibit
an intricate dependence on the degree sequence $d_{(1)},\ldots,d_{(k)}$ of
$\Gamma_k$ as well as the ratio $\alpha/\zeta$. Under a more general radius
regime $R_n$ than that described above, we investigate the asymptotics of the
expectation and variance of sub-tree counts. Moreover, we prove the
corresponding central limit theorem as well. Our proofs rely crucially on a
careful analysis of the sub-tree counts near the boundary using Palm calculus
for Poisson point processes along with estimates for the hyperbolic metric and
measure. For the central limit theorem, we use the abstract normal
approximation result from Last et al. derived using the Malliavin-Stein method.

low-level sensorimotor control is modulated through perceptual and behavioral
learning in a layered structure. CRL follows these principles by implementing a
feedback control loop handling the agent's reactive behaviors (pre-wired

maximize long-term reward. We test our model in a multi-agent game-theoretic

agreement with previous measurements using a variety of instruments and
techniques and with data from the various observatories greatly differing in
their projected fields of view. The consistent results across all data suggest
the absence of an extended source of H$_2$O production, for example sublimation
of icy grains in the coma, or a source with spatial extent confined to the
dimensions of the smallest projected field of view (in this case $<$ 1,000 km).
We find that ISON had an active area of around 10 km$^2$ for heliocentric
distances R$_h$ > 1.2 AU, which then decreased to about half this value from
R$_h$=1.2-0.9 AU. This was followed by a rapid increase in active area at about
R$_h$=0.6 AU, corresponding to the first of three major outbursts ISON
experienced inside of 1 AU. The combination of a detected outburst in the light
curve and rapid increase in active area likely indicates a major nucleus
fragmentation event. The 5-10 km$^2$ active area observed outside of R$_h$=0.6
AU is consistent with a 50-100% active fraction for the nucleus, larger than
typically observed for cometary nuclei. Although the absolute value of the
active area is somewhat dependent on the thermal model employed, the changes in
active area observed are consistent among models. The conclusion of a 50-100+%
active fraction is robust for realistic thermal models of the nucleus. However
the possibility of a contribution of a spatially unresolved distribution of icy
grains cannot be discounted.

representation consisting of sets of frequently co-occurring objects and is
useful for a wide range of scene understanding tasks. We learn scenarios from
data using a novel matrix factorization method which we integrate into a new

semantic information about real world scene images at three levels of
granularity: 1) scene categories, 2) scenarios, and 3) objects. Training a
single ScenarioNet model enables us to perform scene classification, scenario
recognition, multi-object recognition, content-based scene image retrieval, and
content-based image comparison. In addition to solving many tasks in a single,
unified framework, ScenarioNet is more computationally efficient than other
CNNs because it requires significantly fewer parameters while achieving similar
performance on benchmark tasks and is more interpretable because it produces
explanations when making decisions. We validate the utility of scenarios and

characterized by the time evolution $N(t)$ of the number $N$ of static balance
points of the abrading particle. Static balance points correspond to the
critical points of the particle's surface represented as a scalar distance
function $r$, measured from the center of mass, so their time evolution can be
expressed as $N(r(t))$. The mathematical model of the particle can be
constructed on two scales: on the macro scale the particle may be viewed as a
smooth, convex manifold described by the smooth distance function $r$ with
$N=N(r)$ equilibria, while on the micro scale the particle's natural model is a
finely discretized, convex polyhedral approximation $r^{\Delta}$ of $r$, with
$N^{\Delta}=N(r^{\Delta})$ equilibria. There is strong intuitive evidence
suggesting that under some particular evolution models $N(t)$ and
$N^{\Delta}(t)$ primarily evolve in the opposite manner. Here we create the
mathematical framework necessary to understand these phenomenon more broadly,
regardless of the particular evolution equation. We study micro and macro
events in one-parameter families of curves and surfaces, corresponding to
bifurcations triggering the jumps in $N(t)$ and $N^{\Delta}(t)$. We show that
the intuitive picture developed for curvature-driven flows is not only correct,
it has universal validity, as long as the evolving surface $r$ is smooth. In
this case, bifurcations associated with $r$ and $r^{\Delta}$ are coupled to
some extent: resonance-like phenomena in $N^{\Delta}(t)$ can be used to
forecast downward jumps in $N(t)$ (but not upward jumps). Beyond proving
rigorous results for the $\Delta \to 0$ limit on the nontrivial interplay
between singularities in the discrete and continuum approximations we also show
that our mathematical model is structurally stable, i.e. it may be verified by
computer simulations.

block-wise uniform with nonconforming interfaces. In doing so, variations in
the wave speeds of the subterranean media can be accounted for more
efficiently. Staggered grid finite difference operators satisfying the
summation-by-parts (SBP) property are devised to approximate the spatial
derivatives appearing in the acoustic wave equation. These operators are
applied within each block independently. The coupling between blocks is
achieved through simultaneous approximation terms (SATs), which impose the
interface condition weakly, i.e., by penalty. Ratio of the grid spacing of
neighboring blocks is allowed to be rational number, for which specially
designed interpolation formulas are presented. These interpolation formulas
constitute key pieces of the simultaneous approximation terms. The overall
discretization is shown to be energy-conserving and examined on test cases of
both theoretical and practical interests, delivering accurate and stable
simulation results.

SNIa samples accumulated in the past years, we construct an empirical SNIa
light curve model using a statistical method called the functional principal
component analysis (FPCA) for sparse and irregularly sampled functional data.
Using this method, the entire light curve of an SNIa is represented by a linear
combination of principal component functions, and the SNIa is represented by a
few numbers called principal component scores. These scores are used to
establish relations between light curve shapes and physical quantities such as
intrinsic color, interstellar dust reddening, spectral line strength, and
spectral classes. These relations allow for descriptions of some critical
physical quantities based purely on light curve shape parameters. Our study
shows that some important spectral feature information is being encoded in the
broad band light curves, for instance, we find that the light curve shapes are
correlated with the velocity and velocity gradient of the Si II $\lambda$6355
line. This is important for supernova surveys, e.g., LSST and WFIRST. Moreover,
the FPCA light curve model is used to construct the entire light curve shape,
which in turn is used in a functional linear form to adjust intrinsic
luminosity when fitting distance models.

nodes, can a small sample from it provide a rough approximation to the free
energy $\mathcal{F}_n = \log{Z_n}$?
  Results in graph limit literature by Borgs, Chayes, Lov\'asz, S\'os, and
Vesztergombi show that for Ising models on $n$ nodes and interactions of
strength $\Theta(1/n)$, an $\epsilon$ approximation to $\log Z_n / n$ can be
achieved by sampling a randomly induced model on $2^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ nodes.
We show that the sampling complexity of this problem is {\em polynomial in}
$1/\epsilon$. We further show a polynomial dependence on $\epsilon$ cannot be
avoided.
  Our results are very general as they apply to higher order Markov random
fields. For Markov random fields of order $r$, we obtain an algorithm that
achieves $\epsilon$ approximation using a number of samples polynomial in $r$
and $1/\epsilon$ and running time that is $2^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ up to
polynomial factors in $r$ and $\epsilon$. For ferromagnetic Ising models, the
running time is polynomial in $1/\epsilon$.
  Our results are intimately connected to recent research on the regularity
lemma and property testing, where the interest is in finding which properties
can tested within $\epsilon$ error in time polynomial in $1/\epsilon$. In
particular, our proofs build on results from a recent work by Alon, de la Vega,
Kannan and Karpinski, who also introduced the notion of polynomial vertex
sample complexity. Another critical ingredient of the proof is an effective
bound by the authors of the paper relating the variational free energy and the

respect to the magnetic-field direction, with linear phase mixing along
magnetic-field lines proceeding mainly at spatial scales above the ion
gyroradius and nonlinear phase mixing across magnetic-field lines proceeding at
perpendicular scales below the ion gyroradius. Such phase-space anisotropy
could be sought in heliospheric and magnetospheric data of solar-wind
turbulence and has far-reaching implications for the dissipation of turbulence

liquid and a hot solid. The complex interactions between the solid, liquid, and
vapor phases can lead to rich dynamics even in a single Leidenfrost drop. Here
we investigate the self-organized oscillations of Leidenfrost drops that are
excited by a constant flow of evaporated vapor beneath the drop. We show that
for small Leidenfrost drops, the frequency of a recently reported ""breathing
mode"" can be explained by a simple balance of gravitational and surface tension
forces. For large Leidenfrost drops, azimuthal star-shaped oscillations are
observed. Our previous work showed how the coupling between the rapid
evaporated vapor flow and the vapor-liquid interface excites the star
oscillations (Ma \textit{et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids}, 2, 2017, 031602). In our
experiments, star-shaped oscillation modes of $n=2$ to 13 are observed in
different liquids, the number of observed modes depends sensitively on the
liquid viscosity. Here we expand on this work by directly comparing the
oscillations with theoretical predictions, and show how the oscillations are
initiated by a parametric forcing mechanism through pressure oscillations in
the vapor layer. The pressure oscillations are driven by the capillary waves of
a characteristic wavelength beneath the drop. These capillary waves can be
generated by a large shear stress at the liquid-vapor interface due to the
rapid flow of evaporated vapor. We also explore potential effects of thermal
convection in the liquid. Although the measured Rayleigh number is
significantly larger than the critical value, the frequency (wavelength) of the
oscillations depends only on the capillary length of the liquid, and is
independent of the drop radius and substrate temperature. Thus convection seems
to play a minor role in Leidenfrost drop oscillations, which are mostly
hydrodynamic in origin.

interaction between an agent and its environment, such as Markov Decision
Processes (MDP) or Semi-Markov Decision Processes (SMDP), do not capture the
fact that, in an asynchronous environment, the state of the environment may
change during computation performed by the agent. In an asynchronous
environment, minimizing reaction time---the time it takes for an agent to react
to an observation---also minimizes the time in which the state of the
environment may change following observation. In many environments, the
reaction time of an agent directly impacts task performance by permitting the
environment to transition into either an undesirable terminal state or a state
where performing the chosen action is inappropriate. We propose a class of
reactive reinforcement learning algorithms that address this problem of
asynchronous environments by immediately acting after observing new state
information. We compare a reactive SARSA learning algorithm with the
conventional SARSA learning algorithm on two asynchronous robotic tasks

algorithm reduces the reaction time of the agent by approximately the duration

next-generation cellular wireless systems, thanks to the large bandwidth
available compared to sub-6 GHz networks. Nevertheless, communication at these
frequencies requires narrow beams via massive MIMO and beamforming to overcome
the strong signal attenuation, and thus precise beam-alignment between
transmitter and receiver is needed. The resulting signaling overhead may become
a severe impairment, especially in mobile networks with high users density.
Therefore, it is imperative to optimize the beam-alignment protocol to minimize
the signaling overhead. In this paper, the design of energy efficient joint
beam-alignment protocols for two users is addressed, with the goal to minimize
the power consumption during data transmission, subject to rate constraints for
both users, under analog beamforming constraints. It is proved that a bisection
search algorithm is optimal. Additionally, the optimal scheduling strategy of
the two users in the data communication phase is optimized based on the outcome
of beam-alignment, according to a time division multiplexing scheme. The
numerical results show significant decrease in the power consumption for the

burdensome because of the cost of matrix decompositions and storage, such as

we apply Differential Emission Measure (DEM) diagnostics to study the plasma
characteristics of six coronal dimming events. In the core dimming region, we
find a steep and impulsive decrease of density with values up to 50-70%. Five
of the events also reveal an associated drop in temperature of 5-25%. The
secondary dimming regions also show a distinct decrease in density, but less
strong, decreasing by 10-45%. In both the core and the secondary dimming the
density changes are much larger than the temperature changes, confirming that
the dimming regions are mainly caused by plasma evacuation. In the core
dimming, the plasma density reduces rapidly within the first 20-30 min after
the flare start, and does not recover for at least 10 hrs later, whereas the
secondary dimming tends to be more gradual and starts to replenish after 1-2
hrs. The pre-event temperatures are higher in the core dimming (1.7-2.6 MK)
than in the secondary dimming regions (1.6-2.0 MK). Both core and secondary
dimmings are best observed in the AIA 211 \AA\ and 193 \AA\ filters. These
findings suggest that the core dimming corresponds to the footpoints of the

plasma from overlying coronal structures that expand during the CME eruption.

Recent work in population genetics has centered on designing inference methods

techniques exist for more realistic, complex models. To achieve this, two
inferential challenges need to be addressed: (1) population data are
exchangeable, calling for methods that efficiently exploit the symmetries of
the data, and (2) computing likelihoods is intractable as it requires
integrating over a set of correlated, extremely high-dimensional latent
variables. These challenges are traditionally tackled by likelihood-free
methods that use scientific simulators to generate datasets and reduce them to
hand-designed, permutation-invariant summary statistics, often leading to
inaccurate inference. In this work, we develop an exchangeable neural network
that performs summary statistic-free, likelihood-free inference. Our framework
can be applied in a black-box fashion across a variety of simulation-based
tasks, both within and outside biology. We demonstrate the power of our

challenging statistical problem. Existing methods often suffer from the curse
of dimensionality, especially when the decision function is estimated
nonparametrically. To tackle this problem, we propose a dimension reduction
framework that effectively reduces the estimation to a lower-dimensional
subspace of the covariates. We exploit that the individualized dose rule can be
defined in a subspace spanned by a few linear combinations of the covariates,
leading to a more parsimonious model. The proposed framework does not require
the inverse probability of the propensity score under observational studies due
to a direct maximization of the value function. This distinguishes us from the
outcome weighted learning framework, which also solves decision rules directly.
Under the same framework, we further propose a pseudo-direct learning approach
that focuses more on estimating the dimensionality-reduced subspace of the
treatment outcome. Parameters in both approaches can be estimated efficiently
using an orthogonality constrained optimization algorithm on the Stiefel
manifold. Under mild regularity assumptions, the results on the asymptotic
normality of the proposed estimators are established, respectively. We also
derive the consistency and convergence rate for the value function under the
estimated optimal dose rule. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
approaches through extensive simulation studies and a warfarin pharmacogenetic

significantly shorter public keys than the McEliece scheme. In this paper, we
give a polynomial time algorithm that recovers the encapsulated secret. This
attack makes the scheme insecure for the intended use. We obtain this result by
observing that recovering the error in the McEliece scheme corresponding to
Edon-K can be viewed as a decoding problem for the rank-metric. We show that
the code used in Edon-K is in fact a super-code of a Low Rank Parity Check
(LRPC) code of very small rank (1 or 2). A suitable parity-check matrix for the
super-code of such low rank can be easily derived from for the public key. We
then use this parity-check matrix in a decoding algorithm that was devised for
LRPC codes to recover the error. Finally we explain how we decapsulate the

been investigated to determine how the introduction of defects affects basic
superconducting properties, including the critical temperature $T_c$ and the
upper critical field $H_{c2}$, and properties more of interest for
applications, like the critical current density $J_c$ and the related pinning
landscape. The irradiation-induced suppression of the film $T_c$ is
significantly smaller than on a similarly damaged single crystal. Moreover
$H_{c2}$ behaves differently, depending on the field orientation: for H//c the
$H_{c2}$ slope monotonically increases with increasing disorder, whereas for
H//ab it remains constant at low dose and it increases only when the sample is
highly disordered. This suggests that a much higher damage level is necessary
to drive the NdFeAs(O,F) thin film into the dirty limit. Despite the increase
in the low temperature $H_{c2}$, the effects on the $J_c$(H//c) performances
are moderate in the measured temperature and field ranges, with a shifting of
the pinning force maximum from 4.5 T to 6 T after an irradiation of
$2\times10^{15} cm^{-2}$. On the contrary, $J_c$(H//ab) is always suppressed.
The analysis demonstrates that irradiation does introduce point defects acting
as pinning centres proportionally to the irradiation fluence but also
suppresses the effectiveness of c-axis correlated pinning present in the
pristine sample. We estimate that significant performance improvements may be
possible at high field or at temperatures below 10 K. The suppression of the
$J_c$(H//ab) performance is not related to a decrease of the $J_c$ anisotropy
as found in other superconductors. Instead it is due to the presence of point
defects that decrease the efficiency of the ab-plane intrinsic pinning typical
of materials with a layered structure.

spectra for NR and ER events by using a prompt fraction discrimination
parameter, which is optimized using calibration data to have the least number
of ER events that occur in a 50\% NR acceptance region. We then demonstrate how
this discriminant can be used in conjunction with the charge-to-light

determine the functional connectivity between the different regions of the
brain. We present a method using transfer entropy to extract this flow of
information between brain regions from spike-train data commonly obtained in
neurological experiments. Transfer entropy is a statistical measure based in
information theory that attempts to quantify the information flow from one
process to another, and has been applied to find connectivity in simulated
spike-train data. Due to statistical error in the estimator, inferring
functional connectivity requires a method for determining significance in the
transfer entropy values. We discuss the issues with numerical estimation of
transfer entropy and resulting challenges in determining significance before
presenting the trial-shuffle method as a viable option. The trial-shuffle
method, for spike-train data that is split into multiple trials, determines
significant transfer entropy values independently for each individual pair of
neurons by comparing to a created baseline distribution using a rigorous
statistical test. This is in contrast to either globally comparing all neuron
transfer entropy values or comparing pairwise values to a single baseline
value.
  In establishing the viability of this method by comparison to several
alternative approaches in the literature, we find evidence that preserving the
inter-spike-interval timing is important.
  We then use the trial-shuffle method to investigate information flow within a
model network as we vary model parameters. This includes investigating the
global flow of information within a connectivity network divided into two
well-connected subnetworks, going beyond local transfer of information between
pairs of neurons.

policies is modeling the set of feasible building load profiles. In this paper,
we consider buildings whose source of flexibility is their HVAC loads. We
propose a data-driven method to empirically estimate a robust feasible region
of the load using coarse data, that is, using only total building load and
average indoor temperatures. The proposed method uses easy-to-gather coarse
data and can be adapted to buildings of any type. The resulting feasible region
model is robust to temperature prediction errors and is described by linear
constraints. The mathematical simplicity of these constraints makes the
proposed model adaptable to many power system applications, for example,
economic dispatch, and optimal power flow. We validate our model using data
from EnergyPlus and demonstrate its usefulness through a case study in which
flexible building loads are used to balance errors in wind power forecasts.

the ac Stark interaction between off-resonant optical fields and Nd$^{3+}$-ion
dopants in a photonic crystal resonator fabricated from yttrium orthovanadate
(YVO$_4$). Using photon echo techniques, at a detuning of 160 MHz we measure a
maximum ac Stark shift of 2$\pi\times$12.3 MHz per intra-cavity photon, which
is large compared to both the homogeneous linewidth ($\Gamma_h =$100 kHz) and
characteristic width of isolated spectral features created through optical
pumping ($\Gamma_f \approx$3 MHz). The photon-ion interaction strength in the
device is sufficiently large to control the frequency and phase of the ions for
quantum information processing applications. In particular, we discuss and
assess the use of the cavity enhanced ac Stark shift to realize all-optical
quantum memory and detection protocols. Our results establish the ac Stark

Although being commonly viewed as a fast but not accurate version of gradient
descent (GD), it always finds better solutions than GD for modern neural
networks.
  In order to understand this phenomenon, we take an alternative view that SGD
is working on the convolved (thus smoothed) version of the loss function. We
show that, even if the function $f$ has many bad local minima or saddle points,
as long as for every point $x$, the weighted average of the gradients of its
neighborhoods is one point convex with respect to the desired solution $x^*$,
SGD will get close to, and then stay around $x^*$ with constant probability.
More specifically, SGD will not get stuck at ""sharp"" local minima with small
diameters, as long as the neighborhoods of these regions contain enough
gradient information. The neighborhood size is controlled by step size and
gradient noise.
  Our result identifies a set of functions that SGD provably works, which is
much larger than the set of convex functions. Empirically, we observe that the
loss surface of neural networks enjoys nice one point convexity properties
locally, therefore our theorem helps explain why SGD works so well for neural

screening. Existing research recognizes the critical role played by CAD systems
in early detection and diagnosis of lung nodules. However, many CAD systems,
which are used as cancer detection tools, produce a lot of false positives (FP)
and require a further FP reduction step. Furthermore, guidelines for early
diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer are consist of different shape and
volume measurements of abnormalities. Segmentation is at the heart of our
understanding of nodules morphology making it a major area of interest within
the field of computer aided diagnosis systems. This study set out to test the
hypothesis that joint learning of false positive (FP) nodule reduction and
nodule segmentation can improve the computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems'
performance on both tasks. To support this hypothesis we propose a 3D deep
multi-task CNN to tackle these two problems jointly. We tested our system on
LUNA16 dataset and achieved an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 91%
as segmentation accuracy and a score of nearly 92% for FP reduction. As a proof
of our hypothesis, we showed improvements of segmentation and FP reduction
tasks over two baselines. Our results support that joint training of these two
tasks through a multi-task learning approach improves system performance on
both. We also showed that a semi-supervised approach can be used to overcome
the limitation of lack of labeled data for the 3D segmentation task.

develop a new approach that applies to both the Ising and Exponential Random
Graph settings based on a general and natural statistical test. The test can
distinguish the hypotheses with high probability above a certain threshold in
the (inverse) temperature parameter, and is optimal in that below the threshold
no test can distinguish the hypotheses.
  The thresholds do not correspond to the presence of long-range order in the

  The proofs are based on distributional approximation and sharp concentration
of quadratic forms, when restricted to Hamming spheres. The restriction to
Hamming spheres is necessary, since otherwise any scalar statistic is useless
without explicit knowledge of the temperature parameter. At the same time, this
restriction radically changes the behavior of the functions under
consideration, resulting in a much smaller variance than in the independent

method) for concentration of weakly dependent variables. Instead, we carry out
an additional tensorization argument using a Markov chain that respects the

large-scale graphs and capture underlying principles through the overwhelmed
information. Contrast analysis serves as a keystone in various fields and has
demonstrated its effectiveness in mining valuable information. However, it has
been long overlooked in graph pattern mining. Therefore, in this paper, we
introduce the concept of contrast subgraph, that is, a subset of nodes that
have significantly different edges or edge weights in two given graphs of the
same node set. The major challenge comes from the gap between the contrast and
the informativeness. Because of the widely existing noise edges in real-world
graphs, the contrast may lead to subgraphs of pure noise. To avoid such
meaningless subgraphs, we leverage the similarity as the cornerstone of the
contrast. Specifically, we first identify a coherent core, which is a small
subset of nodes with similar edge structures in the two graphs, and then induce
contrast subgraphs from the coherent cores. Moreover, we design a general
family of coherence and contrast metrics and derive a polynomial-time algorithm
to efficiently extract contrast subgraphs. Extensive experiments verify the
necessity of introducing coherent cores as well as the effectiveness and
efficiency of our algorithm. Real-world applications demonstrate the tremendous
potentials of contrast subgraph mining.

capture such emergent trends, and thus to interpret and compare results of
galaxy formation models to each other and to nature. Here, two approximations
are applied to galaxy integrated star formation rate histories, drawn from a
semi-analytic model grafted onto a dark matter simulation. Both a lognormal
functional form and principal component analysis (PCA) approximate the
integrated star formation rate histories fairly well. Machine learning, based
upon simplified galaxy halo histories, is somewhat successful at recovering
both fits. The fits to the histories give fixed time star formation rates which
have notable scatter from their true fixed time rates at final time, especially
for quiescent and ""green valley"" galaxies, and more so for the PCA fit. For
classifying galaxies into subfamilies sharing similar integrated histories,
both approximations are better than using final stellar mass or specific star
formation rate. Several subsamples from the simulation illustrate how these
simple parameterizations can provide points of contact for comparisons between
different galaxy formation samples, or more generally, models. As a side
result, the halo masses of simulated galaxies with early peak star formation
rate (according to the lognormal fit) lie on one of two tracks. The small
fraction of galaxies with a lower halo mass at peak star formation rate appear

has proven to be an effective method for indoor navigation. The positioning
drift can be reduced with regular loop-closures and global relaxation as the
backend, thus achieving a good balance between exploration and exploitation.
Although vision-based systems like laser scanners are typically deployed for
SLAM, these sensors are heavy, energy inefficient, and expensive, making them
unattractive for wearables or smartphone applications. However, the concept of
SLAM can be extended to non-optical systems such as magnetometers. Instead of
matching features such as walls and furniture using some variation of the ICP
algorithm, the local magnetic field can be matched to provide loop-closure and
global trajectory updates in a Gaussian Process (GP) SLAM framework. With a
MEMS-based inertial measurement unit providing a continuous trajectory, and the
matching of locally distinct magnetic field maps, experimental results in this
paper show that a drift-free navigation solution in an indoor environment with
millimetre-level accuracy can be achieved. The GP-SLAM approach presented can
be formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem and it can naturally
perform loop-detection, feature-to-feature distance minimization, global
trajectory optimization, and magnetic field map estimation simultaneously.
Spatially continuous features (i.e. smooth magnetic field signatures) are used
instead of discrete feature correspondences (e.g. point-to-point) as in
conventional vision-based SLAM. These position updates from the ambient
magnetic field also provide enough information for calibrating the
accelerometer and gyroscope bias in-use. The only restriction for this method
is the need for magnetic disturbances (which is typically not an issue
indoors); however, no assumptions are required for the general motion of the
sensor.

practical usage in training and optimizing for real-world applications. On the

address this issue. However, they mainly suffer from low accuracy, as they have
compromised between the processing power and efficiency. These inefficiencies

discuss and propose several crucial design principles for an efficient
architecture design and elaborate intuitions concerning different aspects of
the design procedure. Furthermore, we introduce a new layer called {\it
SAF-pooling} to improve the generalization power of the network while keeping
it simple by choosing best features. Based on such principles, we propose a
simple architecture called {\it SimpNet}. We empirically show that SimpNet
provides a good trade-off between the computation/memory efficiency and the
accuracy solely based on these primitive but crucial principles. SimpNet
outperforms the deeper and more complex architectures such as VGGNet, ResNet,
WideResidualNet \etc, on several well-known benchmarks, while having 2 to 25

especially for the understanding of hadrons with small quark core size
$\sim0.3\,fm.$ We assume that at these distances the QCD vacuum can be
described by the Instanton Liquid Model (ILM). At larger distances, where
confinement is important, ILM should be extended to Dyons Liquid Model (DLM).
The ILM has only two free parameters, average instanton size
$\rho\approx0.3\,fm$ and average inter-instanton distance $R\approx1\,fm$, and
can successfully describe the key features of light hadron physics. One of the
important conceptual results was prediction of the momentum dependent dynamical
quark mass $M\sim(packing\,\,fraction)^{1/2}\,\,\rho^{-1}\approx360\,MeV$,
later confirmed numerically by evaluations in the lattice. The estimates show
that gluon-instanton interaction strength is also big and is controlled by the
value of dynamical gluon mass $M_{g}\approx M$. Heavy quarks interact with
instantons much weaker. The heavy quark-instanton interaction strength is given
by $\Delta m_{Q}\sim packing\,\,fraction\,\,\rho^{-1}\approx70\,MeV.$
Nevertheless, the direct instanton contribution to the colorless heavy-heavy
quarks potential is sizable and must be taken into account. At small distances,
where one-gluon exchange contribution to this potential is dominated, we have
to take into account dynamical gluon mass $M_{g}$. Also, instantons are
generating light-heavy quarks interactions and allow to describe the
nonperturbative effects in heavy-light quarks systems.

judgments by writing code in a meta-level programming language AML. The only
trusted component of Andromeda is a minimalist nucleus (an implementation of
the inference rules of an object-level type theory), which controls
construction and decomposition of type-theoretic judgments.
  Since the nucleus does not perform complex tasks like equality checking
beyond syntactic equality, this responsibility is delegated to the user, who
implements one or more equality checking procedures in the meta-language. The
AML interpreter requests witnesses of equality from user code using the
mechanism of algebraic operations and handlers. Dynamic checks in the nucleus
guarantee that no invalid object-level derivations can be constructed. %even if
the AML code (or interpreter) is untrusted.
  To demonstrate the flexibility of this system structure, we implemented a
nucleus consisting of dependent type theory with equality reflection. Equality
reflection provides a very high level of expressiveness, as it allows the user
to add new judgmental equalities, but it also destroys desirable meta-theoretic
properties of type theory (such as decidability and strong normalization).
  The power of effects and handlers in AML is demonstrated by a standard
library that provides default algorithms for equality checking, computation of
normal forms, and implicit argument filling. Users can extend these new
algorithms by providing local ""hints"" or by completely replacing these

showing how to axiomatize and compute with natural numbers, by axiomatizing the

modelled by the Carreau-Yasuda (CY) and Phan-Thien \& Tanner (PTT) constitutive
equations. Both models account for shear-thinning but only the PTT model
accounts for elasticity. The CY and other generalised Newtonian models have
been previously used in theoretical studies of fluid dampers, but the present
study is the first to perform full two-dimensional (axisymmetric) simulations
employing a viscoelastic constitutive equation. It is found that the CY and PTT
predictions are similar when the excitation frequency is low, but at medium and
higher frequencies the CY model fails to describe important phenomena that are
predicted by the PTT model and observed in experimental studies found in the
literature, such as the hysteresis of the force-displacement and force-velocity
loops. Elastic effects are quantified by applying a decomposition of the damper
force into elastic and viscous components, inspired from LAOS (Large Amplitude
Oscillatory Shear) theory. The CY model also overestimates the damper force
relative to the PTT, because it underpredicts the flow development length
inside the piston-cylinder gap. It is thus concluded that (a) fluid elasticity
must be accounted for and (b) theoretical approaches that rely on the
assumption of one-dimensional flow in the piston-cylinder gap are of limited
accuracy, even if they account for fluid viscoelasticity. The consequences of

test for PSI. A novel MMD estimator using the incomplete U-statistics, which
has an asymptotically Normal distribution (under mild assumptions) and gives
high detection power in PSI, is also proposed and analyzed theoretically.

controlling the deviation from the integrable Manakov limit. Two different

classes of materials for applications as a phonon-mediated high-temperature

hydride (HTe) at high pressure ($p=300$ GPa) is analyzed in details, by using
the isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations. The chosen pressure conditions are
considered here as a case study which corresponds to the highest critical
temperature value ($T_{c}$) in the analyzed material, as determined within
recent density functional theory simulations. It is found that the
Migdal-Eliashberg formalism, which constitutes a strong-coupling generalization
of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, predicts that the critical
temperature value ($T_{c}=52.73$ K) is higher than previous estimates of the
McMillan formula. Further investigations show that the characteristic
dimensionless ratios for the the thermodynamic critical field, the specific
heat for the superconducting state, and the superconducting band gap exceeds
the limits of the BCS theory. In this context, also the effective electron mass
is not equal to the bare electron mass as provided by the BCS theory. On the
basis of these findings it is predicted that the strong-coupling and
retardation effects play pivotal role in the superconducting phase of HTe at
300 GPa, in agreement with similar theoretical estimates for the sibling
hydrogen and hydrogen-based compounds. Hence, it is suggested that the
superconducting state in HTe cannot be properly described within the mean-field

appearance of two spin glass phases SG1 and SG2 in coexistence with the LRO
phase below the A-T and G-T lines. It is shown that the temperature dependence
of the integrated intensity of the antiferromagnetic peak shows dips with
respect to the Brillouin function behaviour around the SG1 and SG2 transition
temperatures. The ferroelectric polarisation changes significantly at the two

techniques, clearly demonstrate that the SG1 and SG2 transitions occur on the

question of whether the components of these pairs are the first and the second
harmonics of radio emission or not has remained open. We discuss properties of
decameter IIIb-III pairs in detail to answer this question. The components of
these pairs, Type IIIb bursts and Type III bursts, have essentially different
durations and polarizations. At the same time their frequency drift rates are
rather close, provided that the drift rates of Type IIIb bursts are a little
larger those of Type III bursts at the same frequency. Frequency ratios of the
bursts at the same moment are close to two. This points at a harmonic
connection of the components in IIIb-III pairs. At the same time there was a
serious difficulty, namely why the first harmonic had fine frequency structure
in the form of striae and the second harmonic did not have it. Recently Loi,
Cairns, and Li ( Astrophys. J. 790, 67, 2014) succeeded in solving this
problem. The physical aspects of observational properties of decameter IIIb-III

We provide a boundary integral representation for general eigenfunctions of $P$

edges can be equipped with complex-valued weights satisfying three natural
axioms. These axioms guarantee that one can construct a $\lambda$-Poisson
kernel. The boundary integral is with respect to distributions, that is,
elements in the dual of the space of locally constant functions. Distributions
are interpreted as finitely additive complex measures. In general, they do not
extend to $\sigma$-additive measures: for this extension, a summability
condition over disjoint boundary arcs is required. Whenever $\lambda$ is in the
resolvent of $P$ as a self-adjoint operator on a naturally associated
$\ell^2$-space and the diagonal elements of the resolvent (`Green function') do
not vanish at $\lambda$, one can use the ordinary edge weights corresponding to
the Green function and obtain the ordinary $\lambda$-Martin kernel.
  We then consider the case when $P$ is invariant under a transitive group
action. In this situation, we study the phenomenon that in addition to the
$\lambda$-Martin kernel, there may be further choices for the edge weights
which give rise to another $\lambda$-Poisson kernel with associated integral
representations. In particular, we compare the resulting distributions on the

[Fe/H]<-5, and only one at [Fe/H]<-7. These stars have very large
carbon-to-iron ratios, with A(C)~7.0, most likely due to fallback in
core-collapse supernovae, which makes their total metallicity Z much higher
than their iron abundances. The failure to find population III stars, those
with no metals, has been interpreted, with support from theoretical modeling,
as the result of a top-heavy initial mass function. With zero or very low metal
abundance limiting radiative cooling, the formation of low-mass stars could be
inhibited. Currently, the star SDSS J1029+1729 sets the potential metallicity
threshold for the formation of low-mass stars at log Z/Z_0~-5. We have
identified SDSS J0023+0307, a primitive star with T_eff =6188+-84 K, and log
g=4.9+-0.5, an upper limit [Fe/H]< -6.6, and a carbon abundance A(C)< 6.3. In

spectra and photometric variability. Up until now, their horizontally averaged
vertical distribution and mean particle size have been largely characterized
using models, one of which is the eddy diffusion-sedimentation model from
Ackerman & Marley (2001) that relies on a sedimentation efficiency parameter,
$f_{\rm sed}$, to determine the vertical extent of clouds in the atmosphere.
However, the physical processes controlling the vertical structure of clouds in
substellar atmospheres are not well understood. In this work, we derive trends
in $f_{\rm sed}$ across a large range of eddy diffusivities ($K_{zz}$),
gravities, material properties, and cloud formation pathways by fitting cloud
distributions calculated by a more detailed cloud microphysics model. We find
that $f_{\rm sed}$ is dependent on $K_{zz}$, but not gravity, when $K_{zz}$ is
held constant. $f_{\rm sed}$ is most sensitive to the nucleation rate of cloud
particles, as determined by material properties like surface energy and
molecular weight. High surface energy materials form fewer, larger cloud
particles, leading to large $f_{\rm sed}$ ($>$1), and vice versa for materials
with low surface energy. For cloud formation via heterogeneous nucleation,
$f_{\rm sed}$ is sensitive to the condensation nuclei flux and radius,
connecting cloud formation in substellar atmospheres to the objects' formation
environments and other atmospheric aerosols. These insights could lead to
improved cloud models that help us better understand substellar atmospheres.
For example, we demonstrate that $f_{\rm sed}$ could increase with increasing
cloud base depth in an atmosphere, shedding light on the nature of the brown
dwarf L/T transition.

nonlinearity which exists in several actuated systems, comprising, e.g.,
rack-and-pinion drives, shaft couplings, toothed gears, and other machine
elements. Generally, the backlash is nested between the moving parts of a
complex dynamic system, which handicaps its proper detection and
identification. A classical example is the two-mass system which can
approximate numerous mechanisms connected by a shaft (or link) with relatively
high stiffness and backlash in series. Information about the presence and
extent of the backlash is seldom exactly known and is rather conditional upon
factors such as wear, fatigue and incipient failures in the components. This
paper proposes a novel backlash identification method using one-side sensing of
a two-mass system. The method is based on the delayed relay operator in
feedback that allows stable and controllable limit cycles to be induced and
operated within the (unknown) backlash gap. The system model, with structural
transformations required for the one-side backlash measurements, is given,
along with the analysis of the delayed relay in velocity feedback. Experimental
evaluations are shown for a two-inertia motor bench that has coupling with
backlash gap of about one degree.

performance of nulling is dominated by residual time-varying instrumental phase
and background errors that keep the instrument off the null. Our work
investigates robustness against instrumental phase. We introduce a modified

subdivision of the entire human cerebral cortex based on connectivity
information. Our contributions are four-fold: First, we propose a clustering
approach to delineate a cortical parcellation that provides a reliable
abstraction of the brain's functional organisation. Second, we cast the
parcellation problem as a feature reduction problem and make use of manifold
learning and image segmentation techniques to identify cortical regions with
distinct structural connectivity patterns. Third, we present a multi-layer
graphical model that combines within- and between-subject connectivity, which
is then decomposed into a cortical parcellation that can represent the whole
population, while accounting for the variability across subjects. Finally, we
conduct a large-scale, systematic comparison of existing parcellation methods,
with a focus on providing some insight into the reliability of brain
parcellations in terms of reflecting the underlying connectivity, as well as,
revealing their impact on network analysis.
  We evaluate the proposed parcellation methods on publicly available data from
the Human Connectome Project and a plethora of quantitative and qualitative
evaluation techniques investigated in the literature. Experiments across
multiple resolutions demonstrate the accuracy of the presented methods at both
subject and group levels with regards to reproducibility and fidelity to the
data. The neuro-biological interpretation of the proposed parcellations is also
investigated by comparing parcel boundaries with well-structured properties of
the cerebral cortex. Results show the advantage of connectivity-driven
parcellations over traditional approaches in terms of better fitting the
underlying connectivity.

cost functions that depend on the system solution with respect to parameters or

multibody dynamic systems. Hybrid systems are characterized by trajectories
that are piecewise continuous in time, with finitely-many discontinuities being
caused by events such as elastic/inelastic impacts or sudden changes in
constraints. The corresponding direct and adjoint sensitivity variables are
also discontinuous at the time of events. The framework discussed herein uses a
jump sensitivity matrix to relate the jump conditions for the direct and
adjoint sensitivities before and after the time event, and provides analytical
jump equations for the adjoint variables. The theoretical framework for
sensitivities for hybrid systems is validated on a five-bar mechanism with
non-smooth contacts.

improvement of educational outcomes, reduction of costs and accessibility
expansion. Due to their unusual massiveness, the large datasets of MOOC
platforms require advanced tools and methodologies for further examination. The
key importance of learning analytics is reflected here. MOOCs offer diverse
challenges and practices for learning analytics to tackle. In view of that,
