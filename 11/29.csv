with compact linear forward operators $T$ having a non-closed range
$\mathcal{R}(T)$ and mapping between infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces plays
some prominent role. As a consequence of the ill-posedness of such problems,
regularization approaches are required, and due to its unlimited qualification
spectral cut-off is an appropriate method for the stable approximate solution
of corresponding inverse problems. For this method, however, the singular
system $\{\sigma_i(T),u_i(T),v_i(T)\}_{i=1}^\infty$ of the compact operator $T$
is needed, at least for $i=1,2,...,N$, up to some stopping index $N$. In this
note we consider $n$-fold integration operators $T=J^n\;(n=1,2,...)$ in
$L^2([0,1])$ occurring in numerous applications, where the solution of the
associated operator equation is characterized by the $n$-th generalized
derivative $x=y^{(n)}$ of the Sobolev space function $y \in H^n([0,1])$. Almost
all textbooks on linear inverse problems present the whole singular system
$\{\sigma_i(J^1),u_i(J^1),v_i(J^1)\}_{i=1}^\infty$ in an explicit manner.
However, they do not discuss the singular systems for $J^n,\;n \ge 2$. We will
emphasize that this seems to be a consequence of the fact that for higher $n$
the eigenvalues $\sigma^2_i(J^n)$ of the associated ODE boundary value problems
obey transcendental equations, the complexity of which is growing with $n$. We
present the transcendental equations for $n=2,3,...$ and discuss and illustrate
the associated eigenfunctions and some of their properties.

the measurement of naturally occurring electrical field. One of the
contributions to the SP signal is the streaming potential, which is of
particular interest in hydrogeophysics as it is directly related to both the
water flow and porous medium properties. The streaming current is generated by
the relative displacement of an excess of electrical charges located in the
electrical double layer surrounding the minerals of the porous media. In this
study, we develop a physically based analytical model to estimate the effective
excess charge density dragged by the water flow under partially saturated
conditions. The proposed model is based on the assumption that the porous media
can be represented by a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes with a fractal pore
size distribution. The excess charge that is effectively dragged by the water
flow is estimated using a flux averaging approach. Under these hypotheses, this
new model describes the effective excess charge density as a function of
saturation and relative permeability while also depending on the chemical and
interface properties, and on petrophysical parameters of the media. The
expression of the model has an analytical single closed-form which is
consistent with a previous model developed from a different approach. The
performance of the proposed model is then tested against previous models and
different sets of laboratory and field data from the literature. The
predictions of the proposed model fits fairly well the experimental data and
shows improvements to estimate the magnitude of the effective excess charge
density over the previous models. This new model proposes a simple and

reading and writing skills. Dyslexia has been frequently linked to cerebral
cortex alterations; however recent evidence also points towards sensory
thalamus dysfunctions: dyslexics showed reduced responses in the left auditory
thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) during speech processing in contrast to
neurotypical readers. In addition, in the visual modality, dyslexics have
reduced structural connectivity between the left visual thalamus (lateral
geniculate nucleus, LGN) and V5/MT, a cerebral cortex region involved in visual
movement processing. Higher LGN-V5/MT connectivity in dyslexics was associated
with the faster rapid naming of letters and numbers (RANln), a measure that is
highly correlated with reading proficiency. We here tested two hypotheses that
were directly derived from these previous findings. First, we tested the
hypothesis that dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left
MGB and the auditory motion-sensitive part of the left planum temporale (mPT).
Second, we hypothesized that the amount of left mPT-MGB connectivity correlates
with dyslexics RANln scores. Using diffusion tensor imaging based probabilistic
tracking we show that male adults with developmental dyslexia have reduced
structural connectivity between the left MGB and the left mPT, confirming the
first hypothesis. Stronger left mPT-MGB connectivity was not associated with
faster RANnl scores in dyslexics, but in neurotypical readers. Our findings
provide first evidence that reduced cortico-thalamic connectivity in the
auditory modality is a feature of developmental dyslexia, and that it may also
impact on reading related cognitive abilities in neurotypical readers.

transport emerges from microscopic chaos. It consists of a triangular lattice
of circular hard scatterers with a moving point particle. Recently this system
became relevant as a model for electronic transport in low-dimensional
nanosystems such as molecular graphene. However, to more realistically mimic
such dynamics, the hard Lorentz gas scatterers should be replaced by soft
potentials. Here we study diffusion in a soft Lorentz gas with Fermi potentials
under variation of the total energy of the moving particle. Our goal is to
understand the diffusion coefficient as a function of the energy. In our
numerical simulations we identify three different dynamical regimes: (i) the
onset of diffusion at small energies; (ii) a transition where for the first
time a particle reaches the top of the potential, characterized by the
diffusion coefficient abruptly dropping to zero; and (iii) diffusion at high
energies, where the diffusion coefficient increases according to a power law in
the energy. All these different regimes are understood analytically in terms of
simple random walk approximations.

but they are still struggling to detect hard faces, such as small, blurred and
partially occluded faces. A reason is that they treat all images and faces
equally, without putting more effort on hard ones; however, many training
images only contain easy faces, which are less helpful to achieve better
performance on hard images. In this paper, we propose that the robustness of a
face detector against hard faces can be improved by learning small faces on
hard images. Our intuitions are (1) hard images are the images which contain at
least one hard face, thus they facilitate training robust face detectors; (2)
most hard faces are small faces and other types of hard faces can be easily
converted to small faces by shrinking. We build an anchor-based deep face
detector, which only output a single feature map with small anchors, to
specifically learn small faces and train it by a novel hard image mining
strategy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on WIDER FACE, FDDB, Pascal
Faces, and AFW datasets to show the effectiveness of our method. Our method
achieves APs of 95.7, 94.9 and 89.7 on easy, medium and hard WIDER FACE val

on the hard subset. Code and model are available at

of the system. We show that this constraint on the solution curve

functional. The proposed variational formulation is intrinsic and provides the
same structure for a wide class of discrete open systems. We illustrate our
theory by presenting examples of open systems experiencing mechanical
interactions, as well as internal diffusion, internal heat transfer, and their
cross-effects. Our approach yields a systematic way to derive the complete

computer scientists over how to design machine learning systems that guarantee
fairness. These debates rarely engage with how racial identity is embedded in
our social experience, making for sociological and psychological complexity.
This complexity challenges the paradigm of considering fairness to be a formal
property of supervised learning with respect to protected personal attributes.
Racial identity is not simply a personal subjective quality. For people labeled
""Black"" it is an ascribed political category that has consequences for social
differentiation embedded in systemic patterns of social inequality achieved
through both social and spatial segregation. In the United States, racial
classification can best be understood as a system of inherently unequal status
categories that places whites as the most privileged category while signifying
the Negro/black category as stigmatized. Social stigma is reinforced through
the unequal distribution of societal rewards and goods along racial lines that
is reinforced by state, corporate, and civic institutions and practices. This
creates a dilemma for society and designers: be blind to racial group
disparities and thereby reify racialized social inequality by no longer
measuring systemic inequality, or be conscious of racial categories in a way
that itself reifies race. We propose a third option. By preceding group
fairness interventions with unsupervised learning to dynamically detect
patterns of segregation, machine learning systems can mitigate the root cause
of social disparities, social segregation and stratification, without further
anchoring status categories of disadvantage.

The dipole axis migrates from the southern to the northern hemisphere during
the magnetic cycle. It is located at higher latitudes at chromospheric activity
cycle minimum and at middle latitudes during cycle maximum. The dipole is
strongest at activity cycle minimum and much weaker at activity cycle maximum.
The behaviour of the large-scale dipolar field during the magnetic cycle
resembles the solar magnetic cycle. Our results are further confirmation that

protecting old knowledge and ideally generalizing from old experience to learn
new tasks faster. Neural networks trained by stochastic gradient descent often
degrade on old tasks when trained successively on new tasks with different data
distributions. This phenomenon, referred to as catastrophic forgetting, is
considered a major hurdle to learning with non-stationary data or sequences of
new tasks, and prevents networks from continually accumulating knowledge and
skills. We examine this issue in the context of reinforcement learning, in a
setting where an agent is exposed to tasks in a sequence. Unlike most other
work, we do not provide an explicit indication to the model of task boundaries,
which is the most general circumstance for a learning agent exposed to
continuous experience. While various methods to counteract catastrophic
forgetting have recently been proposed, we explore a straightforward, general,
and seemingly overlooked solution - that of using experience replay buffers for
all past events - with a mixture of on- and off-policy learning, leveraging
behavioral cloning. We show that this strategy can still learn new tasks
quickly yet can substantially reduce catastrophic forgetting in both Atari and
DMLab domains, even matching the performance of methods that require task
identities. When buffer storage is constrained, we confirm that a simple
mechanism for randomly discarding data allows a limited size buffer to perform
almost as well as an unbounded one.

contextualized word and sentence embeddings extracted from a character-based

our common semantic space in which comparisons between any target text and the

multi-level multimodal attention mechanism which outputs attended visual
features at each level. The best level is chosen to be compared with text
content for maximizing the pertinence scores of image-sentence pairs of the
ground truth. Experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets show
significant performance gains (20%-60% relative) over the state-of-the-art in
phrase localization and set a new performance record on those datasets. We

though electrophysiological recordings have been largely used to characterize
brain states, they are limited in the spatial resolution and cannot target
specific neuronal population. Recently, large-scale optical imaging techniques
coupled with functional indicators overcame these restrictions, and new
pipelines of analysis and novel approaches of SWs modelling are needed to
extract relevant features of the spatio-temporal dynamics of SWs from these
highly spatially resolved data-sets. Here we combined wide-field fluorescence
microscopy and a transgenic mouse model expressing a calcium indicator
(GCaMP6f) in excitatory neurons to study SW propagation over the meso-scale
under ketamine anesthesia. We developed a versatile analysis pipeline to
identify and quantify the spatio-temporal propagation of the SWs. Moreover, we
designed a computational simulator based on a simple theoretical model, which
takes into account the statistics of neuronal activity, the response of
fluorescence proteins and the slow waves dynamics. The simulator was capable of
synthesizing artificial signals that could reliably reproduce several features
of the SWs observed in vivo, thus enabling a calibration tool for the analysis
pipeline. Comparison of experimental and simulated data shows the robustness of
the analysis tools and its potential to uncover mechanistic insights of the

significantly decreased in AD patients as a result of the randomization process

($\omega^{-1}$, where $\omega$ is a characteristic frequency of oscillation of
the star). In this first approach, perturbations are assumed to be purely

history fragmented primordial planetary material within the inner Solar System.
However, the reason for the absence of subsequent planet formation within 0.4AU
remains unsolved. Here, we show that the up debris interior to Mercury's
current orbit is susceptible to outward migration driven by the early Solar
wind, enhanced by the Sun's primordial rapid rotation and strong magnetic
field. The ram pressure arising from azimuthal motion of the Solar wind plasma
transported ~100m-sized objects and smaller from 0.1AU out to the terrestrial
planet-forming zone within the suspected ~30-50,Myr timespan of the Earth's
formation. The mass of material within this size class typically exceeds
Mercury, and can rival that of Earth. Consequently, the present-day region of
terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt has been supplied by a large mass of
material from the innermost, hot Solar system, providing a potential
explanation for the evidence of high-temperature alteration within some

\emph{Steiner tree} of $G$ is a tree that spans $T$. In the vertex-weighted
Steiner tree (VST) problem, each vertex is assigned a non-negative weight, and
the goal is to compute a minimum weight Steiner tree of $G$.
  We study a natural generalization of the VST problem motivated by multi-level
graph construction, the \emph{vertex-weighted grade-of-service Steiner tree
problem} (V-GSST), which can be stated as follows: given a graph $G$ and
terminals $T$, where each terminal $v \in T$ requires a facility of a minimum
grade of service $R(v)\in \{1,2,\ldots\ell\}$, compute a Steiner tree $G'$ by
installing facilities on a subset of vertices, such that any two vertices
requiring a certain grade of service are connected by a path in $G'$ with the
minimum grade of service or better. Facilities of higher grade are more costly
than facilities of lower grade. Multi-level variants such as this one can be
useful in network design problems where vertices may require facilities of
varying priority.
  While similar problems have been studied in the edge-weighted case, they have
not been studied as well in the more general vertex-weighted case. We first
describe a simple heuristic for the V-GSST problem whose approximation ratio
depends on $\ell$, the number of grades of service. We then generalize the
greedy algorithm of [Klein \& Ravi, 1995] to show that the V-GSST problem
admits a $(2 \ln |T|)$-approximation, where $T$ is the set of terminals
requiring some facility. This result is surprising, as it shows that the
(seemingly harder) multi-grade problem can be approximated as well as the VST
problem, and that the approximation ratio does not depend on the number of
grades of service.

chemically doped. This makes SrCu2(BO3)2, an experimental realization of SSL
model, a suitable candidate and understanding of the doping effects in it very
important. Here we report doping-induced emergent states in Mg-doped
SrCu2(BO3)2, which remain stable up to high magnetic fields. Using four
complementary magnetometry techniques and theoretical simulations, a rich
impurity-induced phenomenology at high fields is discovered. The results
demonstrate a rare example in which even a small doping concentration interacts
strongly with both triplets and bound states of triplets, and thus plays a
significant role in the magnetization process even at high magnetic fields.
Moreover, our findings of the emergence of the very stable impurity pairs
provide insights into the anticipated unconventional superconductivity in
SrCu2(BO3)2 and related materials.

constructing a full MSM, which in turn requires additional hyperparameters to

elementary particles in the background of a black hole (BH) is similar to the
description of non-relativistic matter falling toward the BH center. The
velocity of the fall depends on the distance to the center, and it surpasses
the speed of light inside the horizon.~Another analogy to non-relativistic
physics appears in the description of the massless fermionic particle. Its
Hamiltonian inside the BH, when written in the PG reference frame, is identical
to the Hamiltonian of the electronic quasiparticles in type~II Weyl semimetals
(WSII) that reside in the vicinity of a type~II Weyl point. When these
materials are in the equilibrium state, the type II Weyl point becomes the
crossing point of the two pieces of the Fermi surface called Fermi pockets. {It
was previously stated} that there should be a Fermi surface inside a black hole
in equilibrium. In real materials, type II Weyl points come in pairs, and the
descriptions of the quasiparticles in their vicinities are, to a certain
extent, inverse. Namely, the directions of their velocities are opposite. In
line with the mentioned analogy, we propose the hypothesis that inside the
equilibrium BH there exist low-energy excitations moving toward the exterior of
the BH. These excitations are able to escape from the BH, unlike ordinary
matter that falls to its center. The important consequences to the quantum
theory of black holes follow.

be used to measure luminosity distances and hence, when coupled with estimates
for the mergers' host redshifts, infer the Hubble constant, $H_0$. These
observations are, however, affected by GW measurement noise, uncertainties in
host redshifts and peculiar velocities, and are potentially biased by selection
effects and the mis-specification of the cosmological model or the BNS
population. The estimation of $H_0$ from samples of BNS mergers with optical
counterparts is tested here by using a phenomenological model for the GW
strains that captures both the data-driven event selection and the
distance-inclination degeneracy, while being simple enough to facilitate large
numbers of simulations. A rigorous Bayesian approach to analyzing the data from
such simulated BNS merger samples is shown to yield results that are unbiased,
have the appropriate uncertainties, and are robust to model mis-specification.
Applying such methods to a sample of $N \simeq 50$ BNS merger events, as
LIGO+Virgo could produce in the next $\sim 5$ years, should yield robust and
accurate Hubble constant estimates that are precise to a level of $\sim 2$ km
s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, sufficient to reliably resolve the current tension between
local and cosmological measurements of $H_0$.

holographic model of QCD with a fully backreacted quark sector at vanishing
chemical potential. The high temperature deconfined phase is a neutral and
anisotropic plasma showing different pressure gradients along different spatial
directions, similar to the state produced in noncentral heavy-ion collisions.
We find that the chiral transition occurs at a lower temperature in the
presence of anisotropy. Equivalently, we find that anisotropy acts
destructively on the chiral condensate near the transition temperature. These
are precisely the same footprints as the ""inverse magnetic catalysis"" i.e. the
destruction of the condensate with increasing magnetic field observed earlier
on the lattice, in effective field theory models and in holography. Based on
our findings we suggest, in accordance with the conjecture of [1], that the
cause for the inverse magnetic catalysis may be the anisotropy caused by the
presence of the magnetic field instead of the charge dynamics created by it. We
conclude that the weakening of the chiral condensate due to anisotropy is more
general than that due to a magnetic field and we coin the former ""inverse
anisotropic catalysis"". Finally, we observe that any amount of anisotropy
changes the IR physics substantially: the geometry is $\text{AdS}_4 \times
\mathbb{R}$ up to small corrections, confinement is present only up to a
certain scale, and the particles acquire finite widths.

Our detections reinforce the idea that the halo of the LMC seems to be larger

'CAPNet', is introduced to obtain such 2D masks from a predicted 3D point

of the points in the point cloud. To overcome the challenges of sparse
projection maps, we propose a loss formulation termed 'affinity loss' to
generate outlier-free reconstructions. We significantly outperform the existing
projection based approaches on a large-scale synthetic dataset. We show the
utility and generalizability of such a 2D supervised approach through

by the branch point map which assigns to each triple of points their branch
point. We give an axiomatic definition of algebraic trees, define a natural
topology, and equip them with a probability measure on the
Borel-$\sigma$-field.Under an order-separability condition, algebraic (measure)
trees can be considered as tree structure equivalence classes of metric
(measure) trees (i.e.\ subtrees of R-trees). Using Gromov-weak convergence
(i.e.\ sample distance convergence) of the particular representatives given by
the metric arising from the distribution of branch points, we define a
metrizable topology on the space of equivalence classes of algebraic measure
trees.
  In many applications, binary trees are of particular interest. We introduce
on that subspace with the sample shape and the sample subtree mass convergence
two additional, natural topologies. Relying on the connection to triangulations
of the circle, we show that all three topologies are actually the same, and the
space of binary algebraic measure trees is compact. To this end, we provide a
formal definition of triangulations of the circle, and show that the coding map
which sends a triangulation to an algebraic measure tree is a continuous
surjection onto the subspace of binary algebraic non-atomic measure trees.

constrained by experimental searches for CP violation beyond the SM. We propose
an alternative scenario where the EW phase transition and baryogenesis occur at
temperatures of the order of a new physics threshold $\Lambda$ far above the
Fermi scale, say, in the $100-1000$ TeV range. This way the needed new sources
of CP-violation, together with possible associated flavor-violating effects,
decouple from low energy observables. The key ingredient is a new CP- and
flavor-conserving sector at the Fermi scale that ensures the EW symmetry
remains broken and sphalerons suppressed at all temperatures below $\Lambda$.
We analyze a minimal incarnation based on a linear $O(N)$ model. We identify a
specific large-$N$ limit where the effects of the new sector are vanishingly
small at zero temperature while being significant at finite temperature. This
crucially helps the construction of realistic models. A number of accidental
factors, ultimately related to the size of the relevant SM couplings, force $N$
to be above $\sim 100$. Such a large $N$ may seem bizarre, but it does affect
the simplicity of the model and in fact it allows us to carry out a consistent
re-summation of the leading contributions to the thermal effective potential.
Extensions of the SM Higgs sector can be compatible with smaller values $N\sim
20-30$. Collider signatures are all parametrically suppressed by inverse powers
of $N$ and may be challenging to probe, but present constraints from direct
dark matter searches cannot be accommodated in the minimal model. We discuss

Bragg-scattering four-wave-mixing due to their comb-like resonance spectrum.
However, conversion efficiency is limited to 50% due to the equal probability
of up- and down-conversion. Here, we demonstrate how two coupled microrings
enable highly directional conversion between the spectral modes of one of the
rings. An extinction between up- and down-conversion of more than 40 dB is
experimentally observed. Based on this method, we propose a design for on-chip
multiplexed single-photon sources that allow localized frequency modes to be
converted into propagating continuous-mode photon wave packets using a single
operation. The key is that frequency conversion works as a switch on both
spatial and spectral degrees of freedom of photons if the microring is
interferometrically coupled to a bus waveguide. Our numerical results show 99%
conversion efficiency into a propagating mode with a wave packet having a 90%
overlap with a Gaussian for a ratio between intrinsic and coupling quality

problem of the Standard Model (SM). Their direct effects at particle colliders
like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are thus of central interest. While no
direct effects have been observed so far, there are recent indirect hints for
new physics (NP) coming from measurements of rare B meson decays. This thesis
studies direct collider constraints on CHMs as well as the question if these
models can explain the hints for NP in rare B decays. The first part of this
thesis gives a self-contained introduction to all main concepts of CHMs used in
the remainder of the work. These concepts are then applied in several
phenomenological analyses. In the context of global numerical analyses of two
explicit CHMs, the direct constraints on vector, fermion and scalar resonances
are studied in detail. The prospects of various decay channels for observing or
excluding still viable parameter points of the considered models are discussed.
Model independent analyses of the hints for NP in rare B decays are performed
in the context of the $B \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-$ anomaly as well as the hints for
violation of lepton flavor universality (LFU) found in measurements of the
observables $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$. A simple CHM is presented that can explain the
anomalies in rare B decays by partially composite left-handed muons. The flavor
physics of a much more ambitious model, which is based on a UV completion of
effective CHMs called fundamental partial compositeness (FPC), is investigated
in detail. Taking into account all relevant constraints from electroweak scale
physics and low-energy flavor observables, it is shown that this model can
explain the anomalies found in rare B decays.

z=2. Owing to strong stellar feedback, only ~L* halos retain a baryon mass
>~50% of their cosmic budget. Metals are more efficiently retained by halos,
with a retention fraction >~50%. Across all masses and redshifts analyzed >~60%
of the CGM mass originates as IGM accretion (some of which is associated with
infalling halos). Overall, the second most important contribution is wind from
the central galaxy, though gas ejected or stripped from satellites can
contribute a comparable mass in ~L* halos. Gas can persist in the CGM for
billions of years, resulting in well-mixed halo gas. Sight lines through the
CGM are therefore likely to intersect gas of multiple origins. For low-redshift
~L* halos, cool gas (T<10^4.7 K) is distributed on average preferentially along
the galaxy plane, however with strong halo-to-halo variability. The metallicity
of IGM accretion is systematically lower than the metallicity of winds
(typically by >~1 dex), although CGM and IGM metallicities depend significantly
on the treatment of subgrid metal diffusion. Our results highlight the multiple
physical mechanisms that contribute to the CGM and will inform observational
efforts to develop a cohesive picture.

($\log(M_{*})\gtrsim10$) galaxies. X-ray AGN are selected from deep XMM
observations using a new method that results in greater samples with a wider
range of X-ray luminosities, complete to $\log(L_{X})>41$ for $z<0.3$. Taking
X-ray detectability into account, we find the average fraction of X-ray AGN in
the BPT star-forming branch is 2$\%$, suggesting the BPT diagram can provide a
reasonably clean sample of star-forming galaxies. However, the X-ray selection
is itself rather incomplete. At the tip of the AGN branch of the BPT diagram,
the X-ray AGN fraction is only 14$\%$, which may have implications for studies
that exclude AGN based only on X-ray observations. Interestingly, the X-ray AGN
fractions are similar for Seyfert and LINER populations, consistent with LINERs
being true AGN. We find that neither the star-formation dilution nor the hidden
broad-line components can satisfactorily explain the apparent misclassification
of X-ray AGN. On the other hand, $\sim40\%$ of all X-ray AGN have weak emission
lines such that they cannot be placed on the BPT diagram at all and often have
low specific SFRs. Therefore, the most likely explanation for ""misclassified""

redshifts have optical emission lines with extremely high equivalent widths. A
simple model of their emission line fluxes and number density evolution with
redshift is used to predict the number of galaxies that NIRSpec will
serendipitously observe during normal observations with the microshutter array.
At exposure times of ~20 hours in the low-resolution prism mode, the model
predicts that, on average, every open 1x3 'microslit' will contain an
un-targeted galaxy with a detectable [O III] and/or H$\alpha$ emission line;
while most of these detections are predicted to be of [O III], H $\alpha$
detections alone would still number 0.56 per open 'microslit' for this exposure
time. Many of these objects are spectroscopically detectable even when they are
fainter than current photometric limits and/or their flux centroids lie outside

wide variety of galaxy types, ranging from giant ellipticals to spiral galaxies
and dwarfs, located in all (projected) areas of the cluster. It spans a mass
range of 10^(~8.5 - 11) M_Sun. The CO(1-0) line was targeted as a tracer for
the cold molecular gas, along with the associated 3 mm continuum. CO was
detected in 15 of the 30 galaxies observed. All 8 detected galaxies with
stellar masses below 3x10^9 M_Sun have disturbed molecular gas reservoirs, only
6 galaxies are regular/undisturbed. This implies that Fornax is still a very
active environment, having a significant impact on its members. Both detections
and non-detections occur at all projected locations in the cluster. Based on
visual inspection, and the detection of molecular gas tails in alignment with
the direction of the cluster centre, in some cases ram pressure stripping is a
possible candidate for disturbing the molecular gas morphologies and
kinematics. Derived gas fractions in almost all galaxies are lower than
expected for field objects with the same mass, especially for the galaxies with
disturbed molecular gas, with differences of sometimes more than an order of
magnitude. The detection of these disturbed molecular gas reservoirs reveals
the importance of the cluster environment for even the tightly bound molecular
gas phase.

Centaurus A, conducted during commissioning of the Australian Square Kilometre
Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope. We used 16 antennas to observe a 30 square
degree region in a single 12 hour pointing over a 240 MHz band centred on 913
MHz. Our observations achieve an angular resolution of $26\times33$ arcseconds
(480 parsecs), a maximum recoverable angular scale of 30 arcminutes, and a
full-band sensitivity of 85 $\muup$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The resulting maps of
polarisation and Faraday rotation are amongst the most detailed ever made for
radio lobes, with of order 10$^5$ resolution elements covering the source. We
describe several as-yet unreported observational features of the lobe,
including its detailed peak Faraday depth structure, and intricate networks of
depolarised filaments. These results demonstrate the exciting capabilities of
ASKAP for widefield radio polarimetry.

Galaxy. While stars are still being born in the Orion nebula, the oldest part
was believed to be no more than 13 Myr old. In order to study the full
hierarchy of star formation across the Orion complex, we perform a clustering
analysis of the Ori OB1a region using new stellar surveys and derive robust
ages for each identified stellar aggregate. We use Gaia DR2 parameters
supplemented with radial velocities from the GALAH and APOGEE surveys to
perform clustering of the Ori OB1a association. Five overdensities are resolved
in a six-dimensional parameter space (positions, distance, proper motions, and
radial velocity). Most correspond to previously known structures (ASCC 16, 25
Orionis, ASCC 20, ASCC 21). We use Gaia DR2, Pan-STARRS1 and 2MASS photometry
to fit isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagrams of the identified clusters.
The ages of the clusters can thus be measured with ~10% precision. While four
of the clusters have ages between 11 and 13 Myr, the ASCC 20 cluster stands out
at an age of 21 $\pm$ 3 Myr. This is significantly greater than the age of any
previously known component of the Orion complex. To some degree, all clusters
overlap in at least one of the six phase-space dimensions. We argue that the
formation history of the Orion complex, and its relation to the Gould belt,
must be reconsidered. A significant challenge in reconstructing the history of
the Ori OB1a association is to understand the impact of the newly discovered 21
Myr old population on the younger parts of the complex, including their
formation.

multi-dimensional solutions to the Euler equations: new features that arise are
vorticity and a nontrivial incompressible (low Mach number) limit. They present
challenges to finite volume methods. It seems that an important step in this
direction is to first study the new features for the multi-dimensional acoustic
equations. There exists an analogue of the low Mach number limit for this
system and its vorticity is stationary.
  It is shown that a scheme that possesses a stationary discrete vorticity
(vorticity preserving) also has stationary states that are discretizations of
all the analytic stationary states. This property is termed stationarity
preserving. Both these features are not generically fulfilled by finite volume
schemes; in this paper a condition is derived that determines whether a scheme
is stationarity preserving (or, equivalently, vorticity preserving) on a
Cartesian grid.
  Additionally, this paper also uncovers a previously unknown connection to
schemes that comply with the low Mach number limit. Truly multi-dimensional
schemes are found to arise naturally and it is shown that a multi-dimensional
discrete divergence previously discussed in the literature is the only possible
stationarity preserving one (in a certain class).

line equivalent widths ($W$) and a number of galaxy and ISM characteristics for

3.8$. We examine how the equivalent widths of [OII]$\lambda\lambda 3727, 3730$,
H$\beta$, [OIII]$\lambda\lambda 4960, 5008$, [OIII]$+$H$\beta$, H$\alpha$, and
H$\alpha$+[NII]$\lambda\lambda 6550, 6585$, depend on stellar mass, UV slope,
age, star-formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR), ionization parameter
and excitation conditions (O32 and [OIII]/H$\beta$), gas-phase metallicity, and
ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{\rm ion}$). The trend of
increasing $W$ with decreasing stellar mass is strongest for [OIII] (and
[OIII]+H$\beta$). More generally, the equivalent widths of all the lines
increase with redshift at a fixed stellar mass or fixed gas-phase metallicity,
suggesting that high equivalent width galaxies are common at high redshift.
This redshift evolution in equivalent widths can be explained by the increase
in SFR and decrease in metallicity with redshift at a fixed stellar mass.
Consequently, the dependence of $W$ on sSFR is largely invariant with redshift,
particularly when examined for galaxies of a given metallicity. Our results
show that high equivalent width galaxies, specifically those with high $W({\rm
[OIII]})$, have low stellar masses, blue UV slopes, young ages, high sSFRs, ISM
line ratios indicative of high ionization parameters, high $\xi_{\rm ion}$, and
low metallicities. As these characteristics are often attributed to galaxies
with high ionizing escape fractions, galaxies with high $W$ are likely
candidates for the population that dominates cosmic reionization.

kinematic maps for 17 star forming galaxies with stellar masses 8 <

probe the stellar mass ($M_*$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR) range
where simulations suggest that stellar feedback is most effective at driving
gaseous outflows that create galaxy-wide potential fluctuations which can
generate dark matter cores. We compare our kinematic data with the trend
between sSFR, $M_*$ and H$\alpha$ velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, from the
Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. Our observations reveal
a correlation between sSFR and sigma at fixed $M_*$ that is similar to the
trend predicted by simulations: feedback from star formation drives
star-forming gas and newly formed stars into more dispersion dominated orbits.
The observed magnitude of this effect is in good agreement with the FIRE
simulations, in which feedback alters the central density profiles of low mass
galaxies, converting dark matter cusps into cores over time. Our data support
the scenario that stellar feedback drives gaseous outflows and potential
fluctuations, which in turn drive dark matter core formation in dwarf galaxies.

We find that [CII] and the SFR surface density are well correlated in the

agreement with that found for a larger sample of nearby galaxies at kpc scales.
We find that the SFR, and [CII] and TIR luminosities in M51 are dominated by
the extended emission in M51's disk. The companion galaxy M51b, however, shows
a deficit of [CII] emission compared with the TIR emission and SFR surface
density, with [CII] emission detected only in the S-W part of this galaxy. The
[CII] deficit is associated with an enhanced dust temperature in this galaxy.
We interpret the faint [CII] emission in M51b to be a result of suppressed star
formation in this galaxy, while the bright mid- and far-infrared emission,
which drive the TIR and SFR values, are powered by other mechanisms. A similar
but less pronounced effect is seen at the location of the black hole in M51's
center. The observed [CII] deficit in M51b suggests that this galaxy is a
valuable laboratory to study the origin of the apparent [CII] deficit observed

the disk and non-detection of any H II region in a 1.4 kpc radius in projection
are in conflict with the standard environment of core-collapse supernova
progenitors and suggests the possible scenario that the progenitor received a

Interestingly, the two quantum phase transitions in the system - (1) between

several spectroscopic follow-ups to constrain the properties of the emitting

search for non-resonant, extended HeII1640 and metal emission. Extended HeII
radiation is detected on scales of about 100 kpc, but only in some regions
associated with the bright Ly-alpha emission and a continuum-detected source,
implying large and abrupt variations in the line ratios across adjacent regions
in projected space. The recent detection of associated H-alpha emission and
similar abrupt variations in the Ly-alpha kinematics, strongly suggest that the
HeII/Ly-alpha gradient is due to large variations in the physical distances
between the associated quasar and these regions. This implies that the overall
length of the emitting structure could extend to physical Mpc scales and be
mostly oriented along our line of sight. At the same time, the relatively low
HeII/Ly-alpha values suggest that the emitting gas has a broad density
distribution that - if expressed in terms of a lognormal - implies dispersions
as high as those expected in the interstellar medium of galaxies. These results
strengthen the possibility that the density distribution of intergalactic gas
at high-redshift is extremely clumpy and multiphase on scales below our current
observational spatial resolution of a few physical kpc.

strong electron-phonon coupling. In both Re$_{0.82}$Nb$_{0.18}$ and pure Re,
the spontaneous magnetic fields revealed by zero-field $\mu$SR below $T_c$

candidates were selected through a detailed morphological inspection and the
analysis of their magnitude and colors in two wavebands, F475W (Sloan g) and

overdensities in Coma that can be associated with NGC 4889, NGC 4874, and IC
4051 but have spatial scales five to six times larger than individual galaxies.
The highest surface density of globular clusters in Coma is spatially
coincidental with NGC 4889. The most extended overdensity of globular clusters
is associated with NGC 4874. Intracluster globular clusters also form clear
bridges between Coma galaxies. Red globular clusters, which agglomerate around
the center of the three main subgroups, reach higher surface densities than

isochronal dating, especially in young moving groups (YMGs), which contain
large amounts of stars in this mass and age range. If the mass and luminosity
of a star can both be directly determined, this allows for a particularly
robust isochronal analysis. This motivates in-depth studies of low-mass
binaries with spatially resolvable orbits, where dynamical masses can be
derived. Here we present the results of an observing campaign dedicated to
orbital monitoring of AB Dor Ba/Bb, which is a close M-dwarf pair within the
quadruple AB Dor system. We have acquired eight astrometric epochs with the
SPHERE/ZIMPOL and NACO instruments, which we combine with literature data to
improve the robustness and precision for the orbital characterization of the
pair. We find a system mass 0.66+/-0.12 Msun and bolometric luminosities in
log(L/Lsun) of -2.02+/-0.02 and -2.11 +/- 0.02 for AB Dor Ba and Bb,
respectively. These measurements are combined with other YMG pairs in the
literature to start building a framework of empirical isochrones in
mass-luminosity space. This can be used to calibrate theoretical isochrones and
to provide a model-free basis for assessing relative stellar ages. We note a
tentative emerging trend where the youngest moving group members are largely
consistent with theoretical expectations, while stars in older associations
such as the AB Dor moving group appear to be systematically underluminous
relative to isochronal expectations.

the normalizing constant for the posterior density, obtained by integrating the
product of the likelihood and the prior with respect to model parameters. Thus,
the computational burden of computing the marginal likelihood scales with the
dimension of the parameter space. In phylogenetics, where we work with tree
topologies that are high-dimensional models, standard approaches to computing
marginal likelihoods are very slow. Here we study methods to quickly compute
the marginal likelihood of a single fixed tree topology. We benchmark the speed
and accuracy of 19 different methods to compute the marginal likelihood of
phylogenetic topologies on a suite of real datasets. These methods include
several new ones that we develop explicitly to solve this problem, as well as
existing algorithms that we apply to phylogenetic models for the first time.
Altogether, our results show that the accuracy of these methods varies widely,
and that accuracy does not necessarily correlate with computational burden. Our
newly developed methods are orders of magnitude faster than standard
approaches, and in some cases, their accuracy rivals the best established

known to be optimal for matrix multiplication in terms of recovery threshold
under storage constraints. In approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, it is
common to construct efficient in-memory indexes to improve query response time.
One such strategy is Multiple Random Projection Trees (MRPT), which reduces the
set of candidate points over which Euclidean distance calculations are
performed. However, this may result in a high memory footprint and possibly
paging penalties for large or high-dimensional data. Here we propose two
techniques to parallelize MRPT, that exploit data and model parallelism
respectively, by dividing both the data storage and the computation efforts
among different nodes in a distributed computing cluster. This is especially
critical when a single compute node cannot hold the complete dataset in memory.
We also propose a novel coded computation strategy based on MatDot codes for
the model-parallel architecture that, in a straggler-prone environment,
achieves the storage-optimal recovery threshold, i.e., the number of nodes that
are required to serve a query. We experimentally demonstrate that, in the
absence of straggling, our distributed approaches require less query time than
execution on a single processing node, providing near-linear speedups with
respect to the number of worker nodes. Through our experiments on real systems
with simulated straggling, we also show that our strategy achieves a faster
query execution than the uncoded strategy in a straggler-prone environment.

clusters (GCs), makes them efficient factories for producing binary black holes
(BBHs). Here we explore the population of BBHs that form dynamically in GCs and
may be observable at mHz frequencies or higher with LISA. We use our Monte
Carlo stellar dynamics code, which includes gravitational radiation reaction
effects for all BH encounters. By creating a representative local universe of
GCs, we show that up to dozens of these systems may be resolvable by LISA with
signal-to-noise ratios of at least 5. Approximately one third of these binaries
will have measurable eccentricities ($e > 10^{-3}$) in the LISA band and a
small number ($\lesssim 5$) may evolve from the LISA band to the LIGO band
during the LISA mission.

initialization, the nature of activation functions, and their architecture.
There is a wide range of activation functions that are traditionally used to
train a neural network, e.g. sigmoid, tanh, and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). A
widespread practice is to use the same type of activation function in all
neurons in a given layer. In this manuscript, we present a type of neural
network in which the activation functions in every layer form a polynomial
basis; we name this method SWAG after the initials of the last names of the
authors. We tested SWAG on three complex highly non-linear functions as well as
the MNIST handwriting data set. SWAG outperforms and converges faster than the
state of the art performance in fully connected neural networks. Given the low
computational complexity of SWAG, and the fact that it was capable of solving
problems current architectures cannot, it has the potential to change the way
that we approach deep learning.

formulate phase-to-phase and data-to-label relations jointly. Experiments are
performed on a two-phase CT dataset, on which PCN outperforms the baselines
working with one-phase data by a large margin, and we empirically verify that
the gain comes from inter-phase collaboration. Besides, PCN transfers well to
two public single-phase datasets, demonstrating its potential applications.

  Viewpoints from Limited Training Data",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Detecting semantic parts of an object is a challenging task in computer
vision, particularly because it is hard to construct large annotated datasets
due to the difficulty of annotating semantic parts. In this paper we present an
approach which learns from a small training dataset of annotated semantic
parts, where the object is seen from a limited range of viewpoints, but
generalizes to detect semantic parts from a much larger range of viewpoints.
Our approach is based on a matching algorithm for finding accurate spatial
correspondence between two images, which enables semantic parts annotated on
one image to be transplanted to another. In particular, this enables images in
the training dataset to be matched to a virtual 3D model of the object (for
simplicity, we assume that the object viewpoint can be estimated by standard
techniques). Then a clustering algorithm is used to annotate the semantic parts
of the 3D virtual model. This virtual 3D model can be used to synthesize
annotated images from a large range of viewpoint. These can be matched to
images in the test set, using the same matching algorithm, to detect semantic
parts in novel viewpoints of the object. Our algorithm is very simple,
intuitive, and contains very few parameters. We evaluate our approach in the
car subclass of the VehicleSemanticPart dataset. We show it outperforms
standard deep network approaches and, in particular, performs much better on
novel viewpoints. For facilitating the future research, code is available:

Experiments are performed in a square duct at a Reynolds number $Re_{2H}$ of
nearly $1.1\times10^4$, Weissenberg number $Wi$ for single-phase flow is
between 1-2 and results in a drag-reduction of 43% compared to a Newtonian flow
(at the same $Re_{2H}$). Particles are almost neutrally-buoyant hydrogel
spheres having a density ratio of 1.0035$\pm$0.0003 and a duct height ${2H}$ to
particle diameter $d_p$ ratio of around 10. We measure flow statistics for four
different volume fractions $\phi$ namely 5, 10, 15 and 20% by using
refractive-index-matched Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). For both Newtonian
Fluid (NF) and Viscoelastic Fluid (VEF), the drag monotonically increases with
$\phi$. For NF, the magnitude of drag increase due to particle addition can be
reasonably estimated using a concentration dependent effective viscosity for
volume fractions below 10%. The drag increase is, however, underestimated at
higher $\phi$. For VEF, the absolute value of drag is lower than NF but, its
rate of increase with $\phi$ is higher. Similar to particles in a NF, particles
in VEF tend to migrate towards the center of the duct and form a layer of high
concentration at the wall. Interestingly, relatively higher migration towards
the center and lower migration towards the walls is observed for VEF. The
primary Reynolds shear stress reduces with increasing $\phi$ throughout the
duct height for both types of fluid.

experiences of XAI design and evaluation methods across multiple disciplines.
Aiming to support diverse design goals and evaluation methods in XAI research,
after a thorough review of XAI related papers in the fields of machine
learning, visualization, and human-computer interaction, we present a
categorization of interpretable machine learning design goals and evaluation
methods to show a mapping between design goals for different XAI user groups
and their evaluation methods. From our findings, we develop a framework with
step-by-step design guidelines paired with evaluation methods to close the
iterative design and evaluation cycles in multidisciplinary XAI teams. Further,
we provide summarized ready-to-use tables of evaluation methods and
recommendations for different goals in XAI research.

Flory-Huggins energy density. We present results of a simulation showing
detachment of a biofilm protrusion from a base layer of biofilm due to the flow

nerves, bone) on multimodal radiographic images is routinely conducted prior to
spinal surgery and interventional procedures. Generally, magnetic resonance
imaging is conducted to differentiate nerves, while computed tomography (CT) is
used to observe bony structures. The aim of this study is to investigate the
feasibility of automatically segmenting lumbosacral structures (e.g. nerves &
bone) on non-contrast CT with deep learning. Methods: a total of 50 cases with
spinal CT were manually labeled for lumbosacral nerves and bone with Slicer
4.8. The ratio of training: validation: testing is 32:8:10. A 3D-Unet is
adopted to build the model SPINECT for automatically segmenting lumbosacral
structures. Pixel accuracy, IoU, and Dice score are used to assess the
segmentation performance of lumbosacral structures. Results: the testing
results reveals successful segmentation of lumbosacral bone and nerve on CT.
The average pixel accuracy is 0.940 for bone and 0.918 for nerve. The average
IoU is 0.897 for bone and 0.827 for nerve. The dice score is 0.945 for bone and
0.905 for nerve. Conclusions: this pilot study indicated that automatic
segmenting lumbosacral structures (nerves and bone) on non-contrast CT is
feasible and may have utility for planning and navigating spinal interventions
and surgery.

in history that the parent body of a fireball has been identified before its
eventual disintegration in our atmosphere. The subsequent recovery of
meteorites from 2018 LA was only the second time materials from outer space
that reached the ground could be linked with certitude to a particular minor
body. However, meteoroids like 2018 LA and its forerunners, 2008 TC3 and 2014
AA, are perhaps fragments of larger members of the near-Earth object (NEO)
population. As the processes leading to the production of such fragments are
unlikely to spawn just one meteoroid per event, it is important to identify
putative siblings and plausible candidates from which the observed meteoroids
might have originated.
  Aims. Here, we study the pre-impact orbital evolution of 2018 LA to place
this meteoroid within the dynamical context of other NEOs that follow similar
trajectories.
  Methods. Our statistical analyses are based on the results of direct N-body
calculations that use the latest orbit determinations and include perturbations
by the eight major planets, the Moon, the barycentre of the Pluto-Charon
system, and the three largest asteroids. A state-of-the-art NEO orbit model was
used to interpret our findings and a randomization test was applied to estimate
their statistical significance.
  Results. We find a statistically significant excess of NEOs in 2018 LA-like
orbits; among these objects, we find one impactor, 2018 LA, and the fourth
closest known passer-by, 2018 UA. A possible connection with the Chi-Scorpiids
meteor shower is also discussed. The largest known NEO with an orbit similar to
that of 2018 LA is the potentially hazardous asteroid (454100) 2013 BO73 and we
speculate that they both originate from a common precursor via a collisional
cascade.

were conducted: (i) evaluation on AffectNet database to benchmark the proposed

example of the men's EHF (European Handball Federation) Champions League, the
most prestigious men's handball club competition in Europe, which has used
unbalanced groups between the 2015/16 and 2019/20 seasons. Its particular
design is compared to an alternative format with equally strong groups, as well

down-sampled attenuation and emission sinograms. However, no studies have

concurrent programming. Design techniques including read-copy-update (RCU) and
hazard pointers provide workable solutions, and are widely used to great
effect. These techniques rely on the concept of a grace period: nodes that
should be freed are not deallocated immediately, and all threads obey a
protocol to ensure that the deallocating thread can detect when all possible
readers have completed their use of the object. This provides an approach to
safe deallocation, but only when these subtle protocols are implemented
correctly.
  We present a static type system to ensure the correct use of RCU memory
management: that nodes removed from a data structure are always scheduled for
subsequent deallocation, and that nodes are scheduled for deallocation at most
once. As part of our soundness proof, we give an abstract semantics for RCU
memory management primitives which captures the fundamental properties of RCU.
Our type system allows us to give the first proofs of memory safety for RCU
linked list and binary search tree implementations without requiring full

counterintuitive features. In a 2002 work, Barnum et al. argue that these

(Barnum et al., FOCS 2002). In this work, we ask: can all forms of signing
quantum data, even in a possibly weak sense, be completely ruled out? We give
two results which shed significant light on this basic question.
  First, we prove an impossibility result for digital signatures for quantum
data, which extends the result of Barnum et al. Specifically, we show that no
nontrivial combination of correctness and security requirements can be
fulfilled, beyond what is achievable simply by measuring the quantum message
and then signing the outcome. In other words, only classical signature schemes
exist.
  We then show a positive result: a quantum state can be signed with the same
security guarantees as classically, provided that it is also encrypted with the
public key of the intended recipient. Following classical nomenclature, we call
this notion quantum signcryption. Classically, signcryption is only interesting
if it provides superior performance to encypt-then-sign. Quantumly, it is far
more interesting: it is the only signing method available. We develop
""as-strong-as-classical"" security definitions for quantum signcryption and give
secure constructions based on post-quantum public-key primitives. Along the
way, we show that a natural hybrid method of combining classical and quantum
schemes can be used to ""upgrade"" a secure classical scheme to the fully-quantum
setting, in a wide range of cryptographic settings including signcryption,
authenticated encryption, and CCA security.

on the localization of domain boundaries by resonant magnetic diffraction of

the domain boundaries due to destructive interference effects. We demonstrate
this approach by imaging antiphase domains in a collinear antiferromagnet
Fe2Mo3O8, and observe evidence of domain wall interaction with a structural
defect. This technique does not involve any numerical algorithms. It is fast,
sensitive, produces large-scale images in a single-exposure measurement, and is

configuration with atomic accuracy. However, the measurement of ultrafast
structural dynamics in monolayer crystals remains a long-standing challenge due
to a significant reduction of diffraction volume and complexity of data
analysis, prohibiting the application of ultrafast x-ray scattering to study
nonequilibrium structural properties at the two-dimensional limit. Here, we
demonstrate femtosecond surface x-ray diffraction in combination with
crystallographic model-refinement calculations to quantify the ultrafast
structural dynamics of monolayer WSe$_2$ crystals supported on a substrate. We
found the absorbed optical photon energy is preferably coupled to the in-plane
lattice vibrations within 2 picoseconds while the out-of-plane lattice
vibration amplitude remains unchanged during the first 10 picoseconds. The
model-assisted fitting suggests an asymmetric intralayer spacing change upon
excitation. The observed nonequilibrium anisotropic structural dynamics in
two-dimensional materials agrees with first-principles nonadiabatic modeling in
both real and momentum space, marking the distinct structural dynamics of
monolayer crystals from their bulk counterparts. The demonstrated methods
unlock the benefit of surface sensitive x-ray scattering to quantitatively
measure ultrafast structural dynamics in atomically thin materials and across

large-scale detectors with the aim of measuring the small expected flux of
neutrinos at energies in the EeV-range and above. The technique is based on the
thermo-acoustic model, which implies that the energy deposition by a particle
cascade - resulting from a neutrino interaction in a medium with suitable
thermal and acoustic properties - leads to a local heating and a subsequent
characteristic pressure pulse that propagates in the surrounding medium.
Current or recent test setups for acoustic neutrino detection have either been
add-ons to optical neutrino telescopes or have been using acoustic arrays built
for other purposes, typically for military use. While these arrays have been
too small to derive competitive limits on neutrino fluxes, they allowed for
detailed studies of the experimental technique. With the advent of the research

teleophthalmology with low-cost imaging devices. However, the images from such
devices generally have a small field of view (FOV) and image quality
degradations, making matching difficult. In this work, we develop an efficient
and accurate retinal matching technique that combines dimension reduction and
mutual information (MI), called RetinaMatch. The dimension reduction
initializes the MI optimization as a coarse localization process, which narrows
the optimization domain and avoids local optima. The effectiveness of
RetinaMatch is demonstrated on the open fundus image database STARE with
simulated reduced FOV and anticipated degradations, and on retinal images
acquired by adapter-based optics attached to a smartphone. RetinaMatch achieves
a success rate over 94\% on human retinal images with the matched target
registration errors below 2 pixels on average, excluding the observer
variability. It outperforms the standard template matching solutions. In the
application of measuring vessel diameter repeatedly, single pixel errors are
expected. In addition, our method can be used in the process of image
mosaicking with area-based registration, providing a robust approach when the
feature based methods fail. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
template matching algorithm for retina images with small template images from
unconstrained retinal areas. In the context of the emerging mixed reality
market, we envision automated retinal image matching and registration methods
as transformative for advanced teleophthalmology and long-term retinal

intelligence problems due to its ability to outperform other approaches and
even humans at many problems. Despite its popularity we are still unable to
accurately predict the time it will take to train a deep learning network to
solve a given problem. This training time can be seen as the product of the
training time per epoch and the number of epochs which need to be performed to
reach the desired level of accuracy. Some work has been carried out to predict
the training time for an epoch -- most have been based around the assumption
that the training time is linearly related to the number of floating point
operations required. However, this relationship is not true and becomes
exacerbated in cases where other activities start to dominate the execution
time. Such as the time to load data from memory or loss of performance due to
non-optimal parallel execution. In this work we propose an alternative approach
in which we train a deep learning network to predict the execution time for
parts of a deep learning network. Timings for these individual parts can then
be combined to provide a prediction for the whole execution time. This has
advantages over linear approaches as it can model more complex scenarios. But,
also, it has the ability to predict execution times for scenarios unseen in the
training data. Therefore, our approach can be used not only to infer the
execution time for a batch, or entire epoch, but it can also support making a
well-informed choice for the appropriate hardware and model.

algorithm needs to solve a well-known knapsack problem: find an optimal packing
of items into a limited-size knapsack. The BwK problem is a common
generalization of numerous motivating examples, which range from dynamic
pricing to repeated auctions to dynamic ad allocation to network routing and
scheduling. While the prior work on BwK focused on the stochastic version, we
pioneer the other extreme in which the outcomes can be chosen adversarially.
This is a considerably harder problem, compared to both the stochastic version
and the ""classic"" adversarial bandits, in that regret minimization is no longer
feasible. Instead, the objective is to minimize the competitive ratio: the
ratio of the benchmark reward to the algorithm's reward.
  We design an algorithm with competitive ratio O(log T) relative to the best
fixed distribution over actions, where T is the time horizon; we also prove a
matching lower bound. The key conceptual contribution is a new perspective on
the stochastic version of the problem. We suggest a new algorithm for the
stochastic version, which builds on the framework of regret minimization in
repeated games and admits a substantially simpler analysis compared to prior
work. We then analyze this algorithm for the adversarial version and use it as
a subroutine to solve the latter.

both the primary through tides and with the ring through Lindblad torques, and
may exchange material with the ring through accretion and tidal disruption.
Here we show that these coupled ring-satellite systems fall into three distinct
dynamical regimes, which we refer to as `Boomerang,' `Slingshot,' and
`Torque-Dependent.' These regimes are determined by the relative locations of
the Fluid Roche Limit, the synchronous orbit, and the location of the maximum
orbit that Lindblad torques can perturb a satellite. Satellites that accrete
from rings in the Boomerang regime remain interior to the synchronous orbit,
and may be driven back toward the primary by tides. Satellites that accrete
from rings in the Slingshot regime form exterior to the synchronous orbit, and
are always driven away from the primary. Satellites that accrete from rings in
the Torque-Dependent regime may exhibit either Boomerang or Slingshot behavior,
depending on ring and satellite masses. We consider both known and hypothesized
ring/satellite systems in the solar system, and identify which of these three
regimes they fall into. We determine that Uranus exists within the
Torque-Dependent regime. Using the RING-MOONS code, which models the dynamical
evolution of coupled ring-satellite systems, we show that the Uranian satellite
Miranda may have accreted from a massive ancient Roche-interior ring and
followed a Slingshot-like dynamical path to its present orbit beyond the
synchronous orbit, while satellites that accreted after Miranda followed
Boomerang-like evolution paths and remained interior to the synchronous orbit.

place significant challenge as it will reduce speed greatly and consequently
result in unsuccessful turning. This paper presents a hybrid sailboat design to
solve this issue. Electric propellers and control system are added to a model
sailboat. We have further designed the control strategy and tuned the
parameters (PWM-time) experimentally. Finally, the system and control can
complete the tacking maneuver with average speed approximately 10% higher and
enhanced success rate, though the sailboat weight is much heavier.

noise inevitably affects the low-frequency mechanical freedom in optomechanical
experiments. However, we investigate here the beneficial effects of thermal
noise on a basic optomechanical system with parametric instability. In a regime
near parametric instability, it is found that thermal noise in the mechanical
freedom can sustain long-term quasi-coherent oscillations when the system would
otherwise remain in the equilibrium state. In an overlapping regime of
parametric instability and bistability, intermittent switching between a
self-sustained oscillating state and an equilibrium can be induced by adding a
certain amount of noise. When a subthreshold periodic signal is applied to the
mechanics, the switching between the self-sustained oscillations and the
equilibrium exhibits good periodicity at a rate that is synchronized to the
signal frequency, resulting in a significant amplification of the signal. Our
results deepen the understanding of the interplay between optomechanical
nonlinearity and noise and provide theoretical guidance for experimental
observation of noise-induced beneficial phenomena in optomechanics.

conductive filaments in metal/oxide/metal cross-point devices is introduced and
its application demonstrated. The technique is based on thermal discolouration
of a thin photoresist layer deposited on the top electrode of the cross-point
device and relies on the increase in temperature produced by local Joule
heating of an underlying conductive filament. Finite element modelling of the
temperature distribution and its dependencies shows that the maximum
temperature at the top-electrode/photoresist interface is particularly
sensitive to the top-electrode thickness. The technique is demonstrated on NbOx
based metal-oxide-metal cross-point devices with a 25 nm thick top (Pt)
electrode, where it is used to undertake a statistical analysis of the filament
location as a function of device area. This shows that filament formation is
heterogeneous. The majority of filaments form preferentially along the
top-electrode edge and the fraction of these increases with decreasing device
area. Transmission electron microscopy of the top and bottom electrode edges is
used to explain this observation and suggests that it is due to a reduction in
the effective oxide thickness in this region.

field in the ALMA era. It opens up the exciting possibility of detecting and
characterizing magnetic fields and grain growth in disks around young stellar
objects. However, to use polarization for probing the disk properties, its
production mechanism must be ascertained first. To date, the conventional
mechanism involving magnetically aligned grains fails to explain the
polarization patterns detected in most disks. This is especially true for the
inclined disk of HL Tau in ALMA Band 3 (wavelength $\sim 3$ mm), which has an
elliptical polarization pattern. The elliptical pattern was taken as evidence
for polarized emission by dust grains aligned with their long axes
perpendicular the direction of the radiative flux. We show that the radiatively
aligned grains produce a circular, rather than elliptical, polarization pattern
even in inclined disks such as HL Tau. An elliptical polarization pattern can
be produced if the grains are aligned aerodynamically by the difference in
rotation speed between the dust and gas through the Gold mechanism. However, a
strong azimuthal variation in polarized intensity is expected for both the
radiative and aerodynamic alignment, but not observed in the HL Tau disk in
ALMA Band 3. We conclude that neither of these two mechanisms alone can explain
the data and the origin of the 3 mm polarization remains a mystery. We
speculate that this mystery may be resolved by a combination of both direct
emission and scattering by aerodynamically aligned grains.

length scales is numerically challenging to resolve without the employment of
subgrid-scale (SGS) impact and breakup models. In this study, a physics-based
impact and breakup model for the generation of these microbubbles is developed
and implemented. The objectives of this study are to develop a computational

formation of microbubbles, to formulate a physics-based breakup model that
predicts the distribution of microbubble sizes using the characteristics of the
originating gas film, and to integrate these modules into a two-phase flow
solver that accurately captures the effects of bubbles of all sizes. In these
proceedings, an SGS model suitable for the aforementioned problems is proposed,

flow solver are outlined. Two aspects of the development of this SGS model are
then discussed in detail. First, the formulation and implementation of the
first step of the SGS model, the collision detection algorithm, is detailed.
Second, preliminary findings of a numerical investigation intended to shed

rotation slows while chromospheric activity weakens with a power-law dependence
on age, the so-called Skumanich relations. Subsequent characterization of the
mass-dependence of this behavior up to the age of the Sun led to the advent of
gyrochronology, which uses the rotation rate of a star to infer its age from an
empirical calibration. The efficacy of the method relies on predictable angular
momentum loss from a stellar wind entrained in the large-scale magnetic field
produced by global dynamo action. Recent observational evidence suggests that
the global dynamo begins to shut down near the middle of a star's main-sequence
lifetime, leading to a disruption in the production of large-scale magnetic
field, a dramatic reduction in angular momentum loss, and a breakdown of
gyrochronology relations. For solar-type stars this transition appears to occur
near the age of the Sun, when rotation becomes too slow to imprint Coriolis
forces on the global convective patterns, reducing the shear induced by
differential rotation, and disrupting the large-scale dynamo. We use data from
Barnes (2007) to reveal the signature of this transition in the observations
that were originally used to validate gyrochronology. We propose that
chromospheric activity may ultimately provide a more reliable age indicator for
older stars, and we suggest that asteroseismology can be used to help calibrate
activity-age relations for field stars beyond the middle of their main-sequence
lifetimes.

possible supergiant Be X-ray binary. In this work we report on the spin period
evolution of the neutron star based on all the currently available X-ray
observations of the system. We argue that the X-ray luminosity of the system
has remained almost constant since 2010, at a level above ten times the
Eddington limit. Moreover, we find evidence that the spin period of the neutron
star evolved from ~126 s down to ~18 s within a period of about 4 years. We
explain this unprecedented spin evolution in terms of the standard accretion
torque theory. An intriguing consequence for NGC 300 ULX1 is that a neutron
star spin reversal should have occurred a few years after the SN 2010da event.

example of self organization and collective behavior. This well-studied
phenomenon is classically characterized in terms of macroscopic parameters,
such as Lyapunov exponents, that help predict the systems transitions into
globally organized states. However, the local, microscopic, description of this
emergent process continues to elude us. Here we show that at the microscopic
level, synchronization is captured through a gradual process of topological
adjustment in phase space, in which the strange attractors of the two coupled
systems continuously converge, taking similar form, until complete topological
synchronization ensues. We observe the local nucleation of topological
synchronization in specific regions of the systems attractor, providing early
signals of synchrony, that appear significantly before the onset of complete
synchronization. This local synchronization initiates at the regions of the
attractor characterized by lower expansion rates, in which the chaotic
trajectories are least sensitive to slight changes in initial conditions. Our
findings offer an alternative description of synchronization in chaotic
systems, exposing its local embryonic stages that are overlooked by the
currently established global analysis. Such local topological synchronization
enables the identification of configurations where prediction of the state of
one system is possible from measurements on that of the other, even in the
absence of global synchronization.

on the representation, the asymptotic normality is further derived, which shows
that the MDL estimator achieves the optimal statistical efficiency, i.e., the
same efficiency as the classical linear SVM applying to the entire data set in
a single machine setup. Moreover, our asymptotic result avoids the condition on

soft-output detection method that computes the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) of

multiple receive antennas using a forward-and-backward algorithm. To reduce the
computational complexity further, we also present a low-complexity detection

(SM), where the U(1)$_X$ charge of a SM field is given by a linear combination
of its hypercharge and Baryon-minus-Lepton ($B-L$) number. All the gauge and
mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies are cancelled in this model with the
introduction of three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). Unlike the conventional
minimal U(1)$_X$ model, where a universal U(1)$_X$ charge of $-1$ is assigned
to three RHNs, we consider an alternative charge assignment, namely, two RHNs
($N_R^{1,2}$) have U(1)$_X$ charge $-4$ while one RHN ($N_R$) has a $+5$
charge. With a minimal extension of the Higgs sector, the three RHNs acquire
their Majorana masses associated with U(1)$_X$ symmetry breaking. While
$N_R^{1,2}$ have Yukawa coupling with the SM lepton doublets and play an
essential role for the 'minimal seesaw' mechanism, $N_R$ is isolated from the
SM particles due to its U(1)$_X$ charge and hence it is a natural candidate for
the dark matter (DM) without invoking additional symmetries. In this model
context, we investigate the $Z^\prime$-portal RHN DM scenario, where the RHN DM
communicates with the SM particles through the U(1)$_X$ gauge boson ($Z^\prime$
boson). We identify a narrow parameter space by combining the constraints from
the observed DM relic abundance, the results of the search for a $Z^\prime$
boson resonance at the Large Hadron Collider Run-2, and the gauge coupling
perturbativity up to the Planck/Grand Unification scale. For a special choice
of U(1)$_X$ charges for the SM fields allows us to extend the model to
SU(5)$\times$U(1)$_X$ grand unification. In this scenario, the model parameter
space is more severely constrained, which will be explored at future high
energy collider experiments.

estimation can take advantage of verifiable physical constraints, and the
certification is with respect to classical side information. Examples include
randomness from single-photon measurements and device-independent randomness
from Bell tests. Advantages of probability estimation include adaptability to
changing experimental conditions, unproblematic early stopping when goals are
achieved, optimal randomness rates, applicability to Bell tests with small
violations, and unsurpassed finite-data efficiency. We greatly reduce latencies
for producing random bits and formulate an associated rate-tradeoff problem of
independent interest. We also show that the latency is determined by an
information-theoretic measure of nonlocality rather than the Bell violation.

optimally dispatch a population of on/off controllable loads to achieve this

been investigated. In present paper, we investigate a secondary fan-spine (SFS)
structure within the fan of a larger fan-spine topology. On 2013 November 18,
this large fan-spine structure was traced out due to the partial eruption of a
filament, which caused a circular-ribbon flare in active region 11897. The
extrapolated 3D magnetic fields and squashing factor Q maps depict distinctly
this fan-spine topology, its surrounding quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) halo, and
a smaller quasi-circular ribbon with high Q located in the center, which
implies the existence of fine structure within the fan. The imaging
observations, extrapolated 3D fields, and Q maps on November 17 show that there
indeed exists an SFS surrounded by a QSL, which is enveloped by another
QSL-halo corresponding to the overlying larger domeshaped fan. Moreover, the
material flows caused by the null-point reconnection are also detected along
this SFS. After checking the evolution of the underneath magnetic fields, we
suggest that the continuous emergence of magnetic flux within the central
parasitic region encompassed by the opposite-polarity fields results in the
formation of the SFS under the large fan.

several possible models are under consideration for the data, the multiple
imputation is typically performed under a single-best model selected from the
candidate models. This single model selection approach ignores the uncertainty
associated with the model selection and so leads to underestimation of the
variance of multiple imputation estimator. In this paper, we propose a new
multiple imputation procedure incorporating model uncertainty in the final
inference. The proposed method incorporates possible candidate models for the
data into the imputation procedure using the idea of Bayesian Model Averaging
(BMA). The proposed method is directly applicable to handling item nonresponse

investigated. A limited simulation study confirms that our model averaging

plays an important role replacing expensive large-scale linear dynamical
systems by inexpensive reduced order models that capture key features of the
original, full order model. One approach to model reduction finds reduced order
models that are locally optimal approximations in the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm, an
approach taken by the Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (IRKA) among others.
Here we introduce a new approach for $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction
using the projected nonlinear least squares framework previously introduced in
[J. M. Hokanson, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 39 (2017), pp. A3107--A3128]. At each
iteration, we project the $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimization problem onto a
finite-dimensional subspace yielding a weighted least squares rational
approximation problem. Subsequent iterations append this subspace such that the
least squares rational approximant asymptotically satisfies the first order
necessary conditions of the original, $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimization problem.
This enables us to build reduced order models with similar error in the
$\mathcal{H}_2$ norm but using far fewer evaluations of the expensive, full
order model compared to competing methods. Moreover, our new algorithm only
requires access to the transfer function of the full order model, unlike IRKA
which requires a state-space representation or TF-IRKA which requires both the
transfer function and its derivative. Applying the projected nonlinear least
squares framework to the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction problem open
new avenues for related model reduction problems.

with Spitzer 8 $\mu$m data suggests that the $\sim26$-30 K dust seen by
Herschel resides in the photodissociation region (PDR) surrounding the HII
region. Its projected radial profile is consistent with that of a spherical
shell, thus arguing against previous suggestions of cylindrical or planar
geometry. The inferred geometry is, in fact, consistent with previous
interpretations of the HII region as a classical Str\""omgren sphere, except for
the fact that the ionising star (CD -38.11636; O8V) is displaced by more than
half a radius from its geometric centre. None of the previously published
models has satisfactorily accounted for that displacement. It could, however,
be explained by proper motion of the O star at $\sim2$-4 km s$^{-1}$ since its
formation, possibly due to a cloud-cloud collision. We suggest that the current
spherical bubble constitutes the fossilised remnant of the initial expansion of
the HII region following the formation of the star, which now continues to flee

information theory-based approaches seek a subset of features such that the

maximized. Despite the simplicity of this objective, there still remain several
open problems in optimization. These include, for example, the automatic
determination of the optimal subset size (i.e., the number of features) or a
stopping criterion if the greedy searching strategy is adopted. In this paper,
we suggest two stopping criteria by just monitoring the conditional mutual

multivariate matrix-based Renyi's \alpha-entropy functional, which can be
directly estimated from data samples, we showed that the CMI among groups of

Using large-scale galaxy surveys such as SDSS and 2MRS, we test the variation
of expansion expected in the $\Lambda$-CDM model versus a more generic

distribution in the lines of sight to those galaxy groups. We compare the
observed systematic variation of the Hubble flow to mock catalogues from the
Millennium Simulation in the case of the $\Lambda$-CDM model, and a deformed

expansion. Results. We perform a series of statistical tests, ranging from
linear regressions to Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, on the obtained data. They

problems which aims at modeling conditional distribution of images in the

An image in the source domain might have multiple representations in the target
domain. Therefore, ambiguity in modeling of the conditional distribution
arises, specially when the images in the source and target domains come from
different modalities. Current approaches mostly rely on simplifying assumptions
to map both domains into a shared-latent space. Consequently, they are only
able to model the domain-invariant information between the two modalities.
These approaches usually fail to model domain-specific information which has no
representation in the target domain. In this work, we propose an unsupervised
image-to-image translation framework which maximizes a domain-specific
variational information bound and learns the target domain-invariant
representation of the two domain. The proposed framework makes it possible to
map a single source image into multiple images in the target domain, utilizing
several target domain-specific codes sampled randomly from the prior
distribution, or extracted from reference images.

families, according mainly to their magnetic field strength. The one with a
higher magnetic field of $10^{14}$ - $10^{15}$ G is called magnetar,
characterized with repeated short bursts, and the other is X-ray isolated
neutron star (XINS) with $10^{13}$ G. Both magnetars and XINSs show thermal
emission in X-rays, but it has been considered that the thermal spectrum of
magnetars is reproduced with a two-temperature blackbody (2BB), while that of
XINSs shows only a single-temperature blackbody (1BB) and the temperature is
lower than that of magnetars. On the basis of the magnetic field and
temperature, it is often speculated that XINSs may be old and cooled magnetars.
Here we report that all the seven known XINSs show a high-energy component in
addition to the 1BB model. Analyzing all the XMM-Newton data of the XINSs with
the highest statistics ever achieved, we find that their X-ray spectra are all
reproduced with a 2BB model, similar to magnetars. Their emission radii and
temperature ratios are also similar to those of magnetars except for two XINSs,
which show significantly smaller radii than the others. The remarkable
similarity in the X-ray spectra between XINSs and magnetars suggests that their
origins of the emission are also the same. The lower temperature in XINSs can
be explained if XINSs are older than magnetars. Therefore, these results are
the observational indication that supports the standard hypothesis on the
classification of highly-magnetized NSs.

regularization (Lite-SVRC) algorithm for finding the local minimum efficiently
in nonconvex optimization. The proposed algorithm achieves a lower sample
complexity of Hessian matrix computation than existing cubic regularization
based methods. At the heart of our analysis is the choice of a constant batch
size of Hessian matrix computation at each iteration and the stochastic
variance reduction techniques. In detail, for a nonconvex function with $n$
component functions, Lite-SVRC converges to the local minimum within
$\tilde{O}(n+n^{2/3}/\epsilon^{3/2})$ Hessian sample complexity, which is
faster than all existing cubic regularization based methods. Numerical
experiments with different nonconvex optimization problems conducted on real
datasets validate our theoretical results.

nanoparticles (NP). The LAL processes cover logarithmically wide range of
spatiotemporal scales and is not fully understood. The NP produced by LAL are
rather expensive, thus optimization of involved processes is valuable. As the
first step to such optimizations more deep understanding is necessary. We
employ physical models and computer simulations by thermodynamic, hydrodynamic,
and molecular dynamics codes in this direction. Absorbing light metal expanding
into transparent solid or liquid dielectrics is considered. We analyze an
interplay between diffusion, hydrodynamic instability, and decrease of surface
tension down to zero value caused by strong heating and compression
transferring matter into state of overcritical fluids. The primary NPs appear
during expansion and cooling of diffusion zone when pressure in this zone drops
below critical pressure for a metal. Long evolution from the overcritical
states to states below a critical point for a metal and down to critical point
of liquid and deeply down to surrounding pressure of 1 bar is followed.
Conductive heating of liquid from hot metal is significant.

training data synthesis for learning-based computer vision. However, despite
the recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs), it is still a
challenging task to generate images with detailed conditioning on object
shapes. Existing methods for conditional image generation use category labels
and/or keypoints and are only give limited control over object categories. In
this work, we present SCGAN, an architecture to generate images with a desired
shape specified by an input normal map. The shape-conditioned image generation
task is achieved by explicitly modeling the image appearance via a latent
appearance vector. The network is trained using unpaired training samples of
real images and rendered normal maps. This approach enables us to generate
images of arbitrary object categories with the target shape and diverse image
appearances. We show the effectiveness of our method through both qualitative
and quantitative evaluation on training data generation tasks.

shows its great potential accompanied by technological advances in recent
years. Reservoir simulation will play an indispensable role in the prediction
of the implementation of ISC projects. With the computational complexity, it is
imperative to develop an effective and robust parallel in-situ combustion
simulator. In this paper, a mathematical model for In Situ Combustion is
proposed, which takes full consideration for related physical phenomena,
including multi-dimensional multi-component three-phase flow, heat convection
and conduction, chemical reactions, and mass transfer between phases. In the
mathematical model, different governing equations and constraints are involved,
forming a complicated PDE (partial differential equation) system. For physical
and chemical behaviors, some special treatments for the ISC simulator are
discussed and applied. Also, a modified PER (Pseudo-Equilibrium Ratio) method
is proposed in the thesis. A fully implicit scheme is applied, and
discretization is implemented with the FDM (Finite Difference Method). In
solving nonlinear systems, the Newton Method is introduced, and both numerical
and analytical Jacobian matrices are applied. Due to the complexity of an ISC
problem, an appropriate decoupling method must be considered. Thus the
Gauss-Jordan transformation is raised. Then, with certain preconditioners and
iterative solvers, a numerical solution can be obtained. The results of
different models are given, which are validated with the results from CMG
STARS. Also, the scalability of parallelization is proved, indicating the
excellent performance of parallel computing. This accurate, efficient, parallel
ISC simulator applies to complex reservoir models.

using an Anderson-Holstein based dissipative quantum dot setup under two
relevant bias situations: (a) a voltage bias in the absence of an electronic
temperature gradient and (b) an electronic temperature gradient at zero
voltage. It is shown that the direction of phonon transport in the non-linear
regime is different in the two cases since the first case facilitates the
accumulation of phonons in the dot and the second case leads to the absorption
of phonons in the dot. In the linear regime, both the phonon and electronic
transport get decoupled and Onsager's symmetry is verified. We explain the
observed cumulative effects of voltage and electronic temperature gradients on
the non-linear phonon currents by introducing a new transport coefficient that
we term as the \textit{electron induced phonon thermal conductivity}. It is
demonstrated that under suitable operating conditions in Case (a) the dot can
pump in phonons into the hotter phonon reservoirs and in Case (b) the dot can
extract phonons out of the colder phonon reservoirs. Finally, we elaborate on
how the non-linear electronic heat current can be stimulated and controlled by
engineering the temperature of the phonon reservoirs even under vanishing
effective electron flow.

how quantum mechanical techniques can be used for a classical system and we
restrict ourselves to regular two-body interaction potentials. In particular we
compute a mean field limit for the Hamilton Vlasov system in the sense of
Fr\""ohlich, Knowles, Schwarz, and, more recently, Neiss, that arises from
classical dynamics. The structure reveals strong analogy to the bosonic quantum

have attracted much attention as a robust modality for action recognition.
Previous methods model skeletons based on RNN or CNN, which has limited
expressive power for irregular skeleton joints. While graph convolutional
networks (GCN) have been proposed to address irregular graph-structured data,
the fundamental graph construction remains challenging. In this paper, we
represent skeletons naturally on graphs, and propose a graph regression based
GCN (GR-GCN) for skeleton-based action recognition, aiming to capture the
spatio-temporal variation in the data. As the graph representation is crucial
to graph convolution, we first propose graph regression to statistically learn
the underlying graph from multiple observations. In particular, we provide
spatio-temporal modeling of skeletons and pose an optimization problem on the
graph structure over consecutive frames, which enforces the sparsity of the
underlying graph for efficient representation. The optimized graph not only
connects each joint to its neighboring joints in the same frame strongly or
weakly, but also links with relevant joints in the previous and subsequent
frames. We then feed the optimized graph into the GCN along with the
coordinates of the skeleton sequence for feature learning, where we deploy
high-order and fast Chebyshev approximation of spectral graph convolution.
Further, we provide analysis of the variation characterization by the Chebyshev
approximation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed
graph regression and show that the proposed GR-GCN achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on the widely used NTU RGB+D, UT-Kinect and SYSU
3D datasets.

this opens new ways of understanding how people act and move, and how these
movements crystallise into the structural patterns observed by censuses. In
this article we explore the convergence of mobile phone data with more
classical socioeconomic data from census in French cities. We extract mobile
phone indicators from six months worth of Call Detail Records (CDR) data, while
census and administrative data are used to characterize the socioeconomic
organisation of French cities. We address various definitions of cities and
investigate how they impact the relation between mobile phone indicators, such
as the number of calls or the entropy of visited cell towers, and measures of
economic organisation based on census data, such as the level of deprivation,
inequality and segregation. Our findings show that some mobile phone indicators
relate significantly with different socioeconomic organisation of cities.
However, we show that found relations are sensitive to the way cities are
defined and delineated. In several cases, differing city definitions
delineations can change the significance or even the signs of found
correlations. In general, cities delineated in a restricted way (central cores
only) exhibit traces of human activity which are less related to their
socioeconomic organisation than cities delineated as metropolitan areas and

physically pertinent observables at finite $T$, such as the \textit{per}-site

representations whose integrands are expressed in terms of solutions to
auxiliary non-linear integral equations. The derivation of such representations
was based on numerous conjectures: the possibility to exchange the infinite
volume and the infinite Trotter number limits, the existence of a real,
non-degenerate, maximal in modulus Eigenvalue of the quantum transfer matrix,
the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the auxiliary non-linear integral
equations, as well as the possibility to take the infinite Trotter number limit
on their level. We rigorously prove all these conjectures for temperatures
large enough. As a by product of our analysis, we obtain the large-$T$
asymptotic expansion for a subset of sub-dominant Eigenvalues of the quantum
transfer matrix and thus of the associated correlation lengths. This result was
never obtained previously, not even on heuristic grounds.

describe the interaction forces between the liquid and the cantilever. The
novelty of this approach is that, under the assumption of small cantilever
oscillations, by using the superposition principle we found a very simple
integral expression to describe fluid-cantilever interactions. More
specifically we note that, beside including fluid inertia and viscosity (which
is common to many existing models in the literature) an additional diffisivity
term needs to be considered, whose crucial influence for the correct evaluation
of the cantilever response to the thermal excitation is shown in the present
paper. The coefficients of our model are obtained by using numerical results
for a 2D fluid flow around a vibrating rectangular cross-section, and depend on
the distance from the wall. This allowed us to completely characterize the
dynamics of a dAFM cantilever also when it operates in tilted conditions. We

have well defined uniaxial anisotropy. Abrupt changes in the average
resistivity vs. film thickness were observed, which cannot be explained by the
models accounting for the thickness and grain size but strongly correlate with
the changes in (111) texture in the films. We compared our results with the
literature and show that independent of growth method, substrate and deposition
temperature, the AMR value presents a saturation behavior with thickness at
about 100 nm.

two independent points, we design a multi-point supervision formulation to
encode more clues in order to reduce the impact of inaccurate prediction of

of neighbor grid points. The grid guided localization approach is easy to be
extended to different state-of-the-art detection frameworks. Grid R-CNN leads
to high quality object localization, and experiments demonstrate that it
achieves a 4.1% AP gain at IoU=0.8 and a 10.0% AP gain at IoU=0.9 on COCO

wide binaries is identified from a catalog produced by cross-matching APOGEE
stars with UCAC5 astrometry, and we confirm the fidelity of this sample with
precision parallaxes from Gaia DR2. For as many as 14 separate elements, we
compare the abundances between components of our wide binaries, finding they
have very similar chemistry (typically within 0.1 dex). This level of
consistency is more similar than can be expected from stars with different
origins (which show typical abundance differences of 0.3-0.4 dex within our
sample). For the best measured elements, Fe, Si, K, Ca, Mn, and Ni, these
differences are reduced to 0.05-0.08 dex when selecting pairs of dwarf stars

currently be used for chemical tagging at the level of $\sim$0.1 dex or at the

discuss a scenario in which unfavored fragmentations $q/{\bar q} \to D$ and
$s/{\bar s} \to D_s$ are responsible for the asymmetries. We fix the strength

reproduced under the assumption that the flared gas disk has a power-law form

Carlo calculation in RADMC-3D shows that the disk temperature has a gradient
along the vertical direction beyond the dust ring, as it blocks the stellar

flared gas disk in combination with the dust ring. In addition, no significant
depletion of the CO molecules in the cold midplane achieves a reasonable
agreement with the observed twin-line pattern. This result indicates that the

content with receiving the trusted-curator model guarantees. In particular, we
study the utility of hybrid model estimators that compute the mean of arbitrary
real-valued distributions with bounded support. When the curator knows the
distribution's variance, we design a hybrid estimator that, for realistic
datasets and parameter settings, achieves a constant factor improvement over
natural baselines. We then analytically characterize how the estimator's
utility is parameterized by the problem setting and parameter choices. When the
distribution's variance is unknown, we design a heuristic hybrid estimator and
analyze how it compares to the baselines. We find that it often performs better
than the baselines, and sometimes almost as well as the known-variance
estimator. We then answer the question of how our estimator's utility is
affected when users' data are not drawn from the same distribution, but rather
from distributions dependent on their trust model preference. Concretely, we
examine the implications of the two groups' distributions diverging and show
that in some cases, our estimators maintain fairly high utility. We then
demonstrate how our hybrid estimator can be incorporated as a sub-component in
more complex, higher-dimensional applications. Finally, we propose a new
privacy amplification notion for the hybrid model that emerges due to
interaction between the groups, and derive corresponding amplification results

inter-channel dependencies (ICD) based on the CSI, 3) and channel-specific

  This paper presents a generalized C2F framework by making two technical

coarse prediction (a class vector, a detected box, a segmentation mask, etc.)
is encoded into a dense (pixel-level) matrix and concatenated to the original

sees additional information. Second, we present a progressive training strategy
which starts with feeding the ground-truth instead of the coarse output into
the fine model, and gradually increases the fraction of coarse output, so that
at the end of training the fine model is ready for testing. We also relate our
approach to curriculum learning by showing that data difficulty keeps
increasing during the training process. We apply our framework to three vision
tasks including image classification, object localization and semantic
segmentation, and demonstrate consistent accuracy gain compared to the baseline

order perturbation theory. We give the explicit derivation of the
photoionisation (x-ray absorption) cross section and the doubly differential
cross sections for elastic and inelastic Thomson scattering, as well as
resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. A connection to relevant experimental

In this paper, we present a new method, called Optimal Coordinate Ascent (OCA)

relies on coordinate ascent to find an optimal solution for gradient boosting
methods score (number of correctly classified samples). OCA takes into account
the notion of dependencies between variables forming blocks in our
optimization. The coordinate ascent optimization solves the issue of the NP
hard original problem where the number of combinations rapidly explode making a
grid search unfeasible. It reduces considerably the number of iterations
changing this NP hard problem into a polynomial search one. OCA brings
substantial differences and improvements compared to previous coordinate ascent
feature selection method: we group variables into block and individual
variables instead of a binary selection. Our initial guess is based on the
k-best group variables making our initial point more robust. We also introduced
new stopping criteria making our optimization faster. We compare these two
methods on our data set. We found that our method outperforms the initial one.
We also compare our method to the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method

particles. It is shown that: (i) for uniform equilibrium field between the

a simple analytical model for shear Alfv\'{e}nic mode; (ii) for periodic
equilibrium field with local defect, clear AGE is formed inside spectral gap
for both low and high depths of magnetic throats, although lower depth yields
easier observation. The strongest AGE can be in order of $3.1\times10^{-4}$ to
equilibrium field, making it conveniently measurable in experiment. The AGE is
a standing wave localized around the defect which is introduced to break the
system's periodicity, and its wavelength is twice the system's period,
consistent with Bragg's law. Parameter scan reveals that the AGE remains nearly
the same when the number of magnetic ripples is reduced from $18$ to $8$,
however, there occurs an upward frequency shift when the depth of magnetic
ripples drops from $0.5$ to $0.1$, possibly due to a flute-like effect:

the field-induced forbidden-to-allowed transitions. The field modulation of the

formation of a density depletion. We present a comprehensive analysis of the

in detail the temporal evolution of density, magnetic field, plasma flow
velocity, phase speed and position of the wave amplitude. Effects like
reflection, refraction and transmission of the wave strongly support the theory
that large scale disturbances in the corona are fast MHD waves and build the
major distinction to the competing pseudo-wave theory. The formation of
stationary bright fronts was one of the main reasons for the development of
pseudo-waves. Here we show that stationary bright fronts can be produced by the
interactions of an MHD wave with a CH. We find secondary waves that are
traversing through the CH and we show that one part of these traversing waves
leaves the CH again, while another part is being reflected at the CH boundary
inside the CH. We observe a density depletion that is moving in the opposite
direction of the primary wave propagation. We show that the primary wave pushes
the CH boundary to the right, caused by the wave front exerting dynamic
pressure on the CH.

that empty electronic states on Si(331) are essentially localized on the
pentamers with interstitials and under-coordinated Si sp$^2$-like atoms between
them, while filled electronic states are localized on under-coordinated Si
sp$^3$-like atoms and dimers on trenches. The calculated electronic density of

mobile devices, e.g., powerful central processing unit (CPU) and nascent neural

federated learning, has been envisioned as a new AI approach with broad
application prospects. However, the learning process of the existing federated
learning platforms rely on the direct communication between the model owner,
e.g., central cloud or edge server, and the mobile devices for transferring the
model update. Such a direct communication may be energy inefficient or even
unavailable in mobile environments. In this paper, we consider adopting the
relay network to construct a cooperative communication platform for supporting
model update transfer and trading. In the system, the mobile devices generate
model updates based on their training data. The model updates are then
forwarded to the model owner through the cooperative relay network. The model
owner enjoys the learning service provided by the mobile devices. In return,
the mobile devices charge the model owner certain prices. Due to the coupled
interference of wireless transmission among the mobile devices that use the
same relay node, the rational mobile devices have to choose their relay nodes
as well as deciding on their transmission powers. Thus, we formulate a
Stackelberg game model to investigate the interaction among the mobile devices
and that between the mobile devices and the model owner. The Stackelberg
equilibrium is investigated by capitalizing on the exterior point method.
Moreover, we provide a series of insightful analytical and numerical results on
the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game.

circuits (ICs) from counterfeiting, piracy and malicious functionality changes
by an untrusted foundry. It achieves these goals by introducing new inputs,
called key inputs, and additional logic to an IC such that the circuit produces
the correct output only when the key inputs are set to specific values. The
correct values of the key inputs are kept secret from the untrusted foundry and
programmed after manufacturing and before distribution, rendering piracy,
counterfeiting and malicious design changes infeasible. The security of logic
locking relies on the assumption that the untrusted foundry cannot infer the
correct values of the key inputs by analysis of the circuit.
  This paper proposes Functional Analysis attacks on Logic Locking algorithms
(abbreviated as FALL attacks). FALL attacks have two stages. Their first stage
is dependent on the locking algorithm and involves analyzing structural and
functional properties of locked circuits to identify a list of potential
locking keys. The second stage is algorithm agnostic and introduces a powerful
addition to SAT-based attacks called key confirmation. Key confirmation can
identify the correct key from a list of alternatives and works even on circuits
that are resilient to the SAT attack. In comparison to past work, the FALL
attack is more practical as it can often succeed (90% of successful attempts in
our experiments) by only analyzing the locked netlist, without requiring oracle
access to an unlocked circuit. Our experimental evaluation shows that FALL
attacks are able to defeat 65 out of 80 (81%) circuits locked using
Stripped-Functionality Logic Locking (SFLL-HD).

that there are two modes of stacking disorder present, which give rise to an

direct solution of structures with disorder in some dimensions and order in
others. The local and extended structure of a solid determines its properties

scatterings and lose energy. This jet quenching phenomenon may lead to the
suppression of leading hadron productions as well as medium modifications of
full jet observables in heavy-ion collisions. In this talk we discuss the
nuclear modification factors and yield ratios of identified meson such as
$\eta$, $\rho^0$, $\phi$, $\omega$, and $K^0_{\rm S}$ as well as $\pi$ meson at
large $p_T$ in A+A collisions at the next-to-leading order (NLO) with
high-twist approach of parton energy loss. Then we discuss a newly developed
formalism of combing NLO matrix elements and parton shower (PS) for initial
hard production with parton energy loss in the QGP, and its application in
investigating massive gauge boson ($Z^0$/$W^{\pm}$) tagged jet productions and
$b\bar{b}$ dijet correlations in Pb+Pb at the LHC.

  Problem in Perfect Graphs",,,,,"cs.DS math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the selective graph coloring problem, which is a generalization
of the classical graph coloring problem. Given a graph together with a
partition of its vertex set into clusters, we want to choose exactly one vertex
per cluster so that the number of colors needed to color the selected set of
vertices is minimized. This problem is known to be NP-hard. In this study, we
focus on an exact cutting plane algorithm for selective graph coloring in
perfect graphs. Since there exists no suite of perfect graph instances to the
best of our knowledge, we also propose an algorithm to randomly (but not
uniformly) generate perfect graphs, and provide a large collection of instances
available online. We conduct computational experiments to test our method on
graphs with varying size and densities, and compare our results with a
state-of-the-art algorithm from the literature and with solving an integer
programming formulation of the problem by CPLEX. Our experiments demonstrate
that our solution strategy significantly improves the solvability of the
problem.

  on LAPD",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Characterizing the gap eigenmode of shear Alfv\'{e}n waves (SAW) and its
interaction with energetic ions is important to the success of magnetically
confined fusion. Previous studies have reported an experimental observation of
the spectral gap of SAW on LAPD (Zhang et al 2008 Phys. Plasmas 15 012103), a
linear large plasma device (Gekelman et al 1991 Rev. Sci. Instrum. 62 2875)
possessing easier diagnostic access and lower cost compared with traditional
fusion devices, and analytical theory and numerical gap eigenmode using ideal
conditions (Chang 2014 PhD Thesis at Australian National University). To guide
experimental implementation, the present work models the gap eigenmode of SAW
using exact LAPD parameters. A full picture of the wave field for previous
experiment reveals that the previously observed spectral gap is not global but
an axially local result. To form a global spectral gap, the number of magnetic
mirrors has to be increased and stronger static magnetic field makes it more
clear. Such a spectral gap is obtained for the magnetic field of
$B_0(z)=1.2+0.6\cos[2\pi (z-33.68)/3.63]$ with $7.74$~m magnetic beach. By
introducing two types of local defects (corresponding to $E_\theta(z_0)=0$ and
$E_\theta'(z_0)=0$ respectively), odd-parity and even-parity discrete
eigenmodes are formed clearly inside the gap. The strength of these gap
eigenmodes decreases significantly with collision frequency, which is
consistent with previous studies. Parameter scans show that these gap
eigenmodes can be even formed successfully for the field strength of
$B_0(z)=0.2+0.1\cos[2\pi (z-33.68)/3.63]$ and with only $4$ magnetic mirrors,
which are achievable by LAPD at its present status. This work can serve as a
strong motivation and direct reference for the experimental implementation of
the gap eigenmode of SAW on LAPD and other linear plasma devices.

the exact mechanism of quarkonium production still remains elusive. Even

perturbation (2PT) treatment of the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) breaks down
for the alloys containing heavier ions, while it provides a very accurate
description of the MAE behaviour of FeCo, FeCu, and FePd. Moreover, the
robustness of the 2PT approximation is such that in these cases it accounts for
the MAE of highly-non-neutral alloys and, thus, it can be used to predict their
performance when dopants are present or when they are subject to applied gate
bias, which are typical conditions in working magnetoelectric devices. We also
observe that switching of the easy axis direction can be induced in some of
these alloys by addition or removal of, at least, one electron per cell. In all
cases, the details of the bandstructure are responsible for the finally
observed MAE value and, therefore, suggest a limited predicting power of models
based on the expected orbital moment values and bandwidths. Finally, we have
confirmed the importance of various calculation parameters to obtain converged
MAE values, in particular, those related to the accuracy of the Fermi level

classical confinement, and its effect on the local Seebeck coefficient has
mostly been neglected, as has the Peltier effect in general due to the
complexity of measuring small temperature gradients locally. Here we report
that reducing the width of a graphene channel to 100 nm changes the Seebeck

us to probe the local temperature of electrically contacted graphene
two-terminal devices or to locally heat the sample. We show that constrictions
in mono- and bilayer graphene facilitate a spatially correlated gradient in the
Seebeck and Peltier coefficient, as evidenced by the pronounced thermovoltage
$V_{th}$ and heating/cooling response $\Delta T_{Peltier}$, respectively. This
geometry dependent effect, which has not been reported previously in 2D

forbidden gaps in the continuous spectrum, it is still yet unknown about the
minimum number and depth of periodic modulations for clear spectral formation.
This limit is explored by investigating shear Alfv\'{e}n waves propagating
through magnetic mirror array in a low temperature plasma cylinder, referring
to an existing experiment [Zhang et al., Phys. Plasmas 15, 012103 (2008)]. It
is found that the bottom-edge ratio, a defined parameter characterizing how
""noisy"" the formed spectral gap is, scales inversely with the square of the
number and depth of magnetic mirrors, and they should be bigger than $7$ and
$0.4$ respectively to form a clear spectral gap for the plasma conditions
employed. This scaling is consistent with a pervious analysis [Kryuchkyan and
Hatsagortsyan, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 053604 (2011)], and also applicable to
other fields such as optics and semiconductors. Moreover, it shows that the
center of spectral gap experiences a parabolic shape of descending frequency
shift when the modulation depth is increased, which is believed to be a new
discovery.

We generalise two approaches proposed in the literature and show that,
regardless of the dark-energy model, the new virialization term can be
calibrated on the peculiar velocity of the shell as measured from Einstein-de
Sitter simulations. The two virialization recipes qualitatively reproduce the
features of the ordinary SCM, i.e., a constant $\Delta_{\rm vir}$ for the EdS
model and time-variation for dark-energy models, but without any mass
dependence. Depending on the actual description of virialization and on the
dark-energy model, the value of $\Delta_{\rm vir}$ varies between 10 and 40
percent. We use the new recipes to predict the surface-mass-density profile of
dark matter haloes and the number of convergence density peaks for LSST- and

$T(E,\gamma)$ in strongly coupled systems and we illustrate its main features

microcanonical thermodynamics. Interestingly, while this $T(E,\gamma)$ is a
monotonically increasing function of the total energy $E$, its dependence with
$\gamma$ is a purely quantum effect notably visible near the ground state

burst oscillations, in their lightcurves during thermonuclear X-ray bursts.
Their frequencies can be offset from the spin frequency of the NS (known
independently) by several Hz, and can drift by 1-3 Hz. One plausible
explanation for this phenomenon is that a wave is present in the bursting ocean
that decreases in frequency (in the rotating frame) as the burst cools. The
strongest candidate is the buoyant $r$-mode; however, models for the burning
ocean background used in previous studies over-predict frequency drifts by
several Hz. Using new background models (which include shallow heating, and
burning in the tail of the burst) the evolution of the buoyant $r$-mode is
calculated. The resulting frequency drifts are smaller, in line with
observations. This illustrates the importance of accounting for the detailed
nuclear physics in these bursts.

are performed in the dilepton and lepton-plus-jets $t\bar{t}$ decay channels.
Results are presented at particle level in the form of inclusive cross-sections
of $t\bar{t}$ final states with three and four $b$-jets as well as differential
cross-sections as a function of global event properties and properties of
$b$-jet pairs. The measured inclusive fiducial cross-sections generally exceed
the $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ predictions from various next-to-leading-order matrix
element calculations matched to a parton shower but are compatible within the
total uncertainties. The experimental uncertainties are smaller than the
uncertainties in the predictions. Comparisons of state-of-the-art theoretical
predictions with the differential measurements are shown and good agreement
with data is found for most of them.

the filaments and become more dispersed with time. Both the supernova-induced

heavy relative to the ion. In typical experiments, however, ultracold buffer
gases are confined in traps resulting in localised, non-uniform density
distributions. Using a superstatistical approach, we develop an analytical
model for an ion interacting with a localised buffer gas. We demonstrate
theoretically that limiting collisions to the centre of the ion trap enables
cooling at far greater mass ratios than achievable using a uniform buffer gas,
but that an upper limit to the usable mass ratio exists even in this case.
Furthermore, we analytically derive the energy distribution for an ion
interacting with a buffer gas held in a harmonic potential. The analytical
distribution obtained is found to be in excellent agreement with the results of
numerical simulations.

scattering length to intermediate values, we reveal a universal regime where
the period of the coherent atom-molecule oscillations is set by the molecule
binding energy. For the largest scattering lengths we can numerically simulate

Coevolution stands for coupled dynamics of the state of the nodes and of the

evolution of the network by link rewiring. Nonlinearity of the interactions is
taken into account through a parameter q that describes the nonlinear effect of
local majorities, being q = 1 the marginal situation of the ordinary voter
model. Finally the connection between the two layers is measured by a degree of
multiplexing `. In terms of these three parameters, p, q and ` we find a rich
phase diagram with different phases and transitions. When the two layers have
the same plasticity p, the fragmentation transition observed in a single layer
is shifted to larger values of p plasticity, so that multiplexing avoids
fragmentation. Different plasticities for the two layers lead to new phases
that do not exist in a coevolving nonlinear voter model in a single layer,
namely an asymmetric fragmented phase for q > 1 and an active shattered phase

is developed, which aims to improve the global search ability and local search

proposed method involves three basic sub-criteria to infill new samples
asynchronously to balance the global exploration and local exploitation. First,
to capture the promising possible global optimal region, searching for the
global optimum with genetic algorithm (GA) based on the current surrogate
models of the objective and constraint functions. Second, to infill samples in
the region with sparse samples to improve the global accuracy of the surrogate
models, a grid searching with Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) with the current
surrogate model is adopted to explore the sample space. Third, to accelerate
the local searching efficiency, searching for a local optimum with sequential
quadratic programming (SQP) based on the local surrogate models in the reduced
interval, which involves some samples near the current optimum. When the new
sample is too close to the existing ones, the new sample should be abandoned,
due to the poor additional information. According to the three sub-criteria,
the new samples are placed in the regions which have not been fully explored
and includes the possible global optimum point. When a possible global optimum
point is found, the local searching sub-criterion captures the local optimum
around it rapidly. Numerical and engineering examples are used to verify the
efficiency of the proposed method. The statistical results show that the
proposed method has good global searching ability and efficiency.

optimization problems under uncertainty on the other hand. Solutions are
so-called winning strategies for the existential player that specify how to
react on moves of the universal player - i.e. certain assignments of

  QIPs can be solved with the help of game tree search that is enhanced with
non-chronological back-jumping. We develop and theoretically substantiate
pruning techniques based upon (algebraic) properties similar to pruning

Furthermore, we introduce a Variational HCN enhanced with turn dropout which

Using relational reasoning modules, such as the non-local module
\cite{wang2017non}, can therefore improve object detection. Current schemes
apply such dedicated modules either to a specific layer of the bottom-up
stream, or between already-detected objects. We show that the relational
process can be better modeled in a coarse-to-fine manner and present a novel
framework, applying a non-local module sequentially to increasing resolution
feature maps along the top-down stream. In this way, information can naturally
passed from larger objects to smaller related ones. Applying the module to fine
feature maps further allows the information to pass between the small objects
themselves, exploiting repetitions of instances of the same class. In practice,
due to the expensive memory utilization of the non-local module, it is
infeasible to apply the module as currently used to high-resolution feature
maps. We redesigned the non local module, improved it in terms of memory and
number of operations, allowing it to be placed anywhere along the network. We
further incorporated relative spatial information into the module, in a manner
that can be incorporated into our efficient implementation. We show the
effectiveness of our scheme by improving the results of detecting small objects

particularly large at millimeter wavelengths. New clues to calibrate the
atmospheric models can be obtained with the advent of the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio interferometer. In this work, we
analyzed the lower limit of the polar brightening observed at 100 and 230 GHz
by ALMA, during its Science Verification period, 2015 December 16-20. We find
that the average polar intensity is higher than the disk intensity at 100 and
230 GHz, with larger brightness intensities at the South pole in eight of the
nine maps analyzed. The observational results were compared with calculations
of the millimetric limb brightnening emission for two semi-empirical
atmospheric models, FAL- C (Fontenla et al. 1993) and SSC (Selhorst et al.
2005a). Both models presented larger limb intensities than the averaged
observed values. The intensities obtained with the SSC model were closer to the
observations, with polar brightenings of 10.5% and 17.8% at 100 and 230 GHz,
respectively. This discrepancy may be due to the presence of chromospheric
features (like spicules) at regions close to the limb.

characterization of when $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{Z}G)$ satisfies Kazhdan's
property $(\operatorname{T})$, both in terms of the finite group $G$ and in
terms of the simple components of the semisimple algebra $\mathbb{Q}G$.
Furthermore, it is shown that for $\mathcal{U}( \mathbb{Z} G)$ this property is
equivalent to the weaker property $\operatorname{FAb}$ (i.e. every subgroup of
finite index has finite abelianization), and in particular also to a hereditary
version of Serre's property $\operatorname{FA}$, denoted $\operatorname{HFA}$.
More precisely, it is described when all subgroups of finite index in
$\mathcal{U} (\mathbb{Z} G)$ have both finite abelianization and are not a
non-trivial amalgamated product. A crucial step for this is a reduction to
arithmetic groups $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathcal{O})$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is an
order in a finite dimensional semisimple $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra $D$, and finite
groups $G$ which have the so-called cut property. For such groups $G$ we
describe the simple epimorphic images of $\mathbb{Q} G$. The proof of the unit
theorem fundamentally relies on fixed point properties and the abelianization
of the elementary subgroups $\operatorname{E}_n(D)$ of

degenerate case of lower rank, i.e.\ for $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$

nonstationarities. In this article we describe their similarities in a general
framework of detrending methods. We establish this framework independently of
the definition of DFA or DMA but by investigating the failure of standard
statistical tools applied on nonstationary time series, let these be intrinsic
nonstationarities such as for Brownian pathes, or external ones due to additive
trends. In particular, we investigate the sample averaged mean squared
displacement of the summed time series. By modifying this estimator we
introduce a general form of the so-called fluctuation function and can
formulate the framework of detrending methods. A detrending method provides an
estimator of the fluctuation function which obeys the following principles: The
first relates the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation function to the
stochastic properties of the time series. The second principles claims
unbiasedness of the estimatior. This is the centerpiece of the detrending
procedure and ensures that the detrending method can be applied to
nonstationary time series, e.g. FBM or additive trends. Both principles are
formulated and investigated in detail for DFA and DMA by using the relationship
between the fluctuation function and the autocovariance function of the
underlying stochastic process of the time series.

binary HD166734 with newly calibrated MESA stellar evolution models for single

of core overshooting (alpha = 0.5), mass loss, and rotational mixing. We can
utilise the gradient in the M-L plane to constrain the amount of mass loss to
0.5 - 1.5 times the standard Vink et al. 2001 prescriptions, and we can exclude
extreme reduction or multiplication factors. The extent of the vectors in the
M-L plane leads us to conclude that the amount of core overshooting is larger
than is normally adopted in contemporary massive star evolution models. We
furthermore conclude that rotational mixing is mandatory to get the nitrogen
abundance ratios between the primary and secondary components to be correct
(3:1) in our testbed binary system. Our calibrated grid of models, alongside
our new M-L plane approach, present the possibility of a widened main sequence
due to an increased demand for core overshooting. The increased amount of core
overshooting is not only needed to explain the extended main sequence, but the
enhanced overshooting is also needed to explain the location of the
upper-luminosity limit of the red supergiants. Finally, the increased amount of
core overshooting has -- via the compactness parameter -- implications for
supernova explodibility.

developing robust and precise techniques to constrain the underlying

different types of supervised learning for backward modelling (from signal to
parameters) are examples of such techniques. They usually require many
instances of forward modelling (from parameters to signal) in sampling the
parameters space, either when performing the steps of the Markov Chain or when
building a training sample for supervised learning. As forward modelling can be
costly (if performed with numerical simulations for example), we should attempt
to perform an optimal sampling according to some principle. With this goal in
mind, we present an approach based on defining a metric on the space of
observables, induced by the manner through which the modelling creates a
mapping from the parameter space onto the space of observables. This metric
bears a close connection to Jeffreys' prior from information theory. It is used
to generate a homogeneous and isotropic sampling of the signal space with two
different methods. We show that when the resulting optimized samplings, created
with 21cmFAST, are used to train a neural network we obtain a modest reduction
of the error on parameter reconstruction of ~10% (compared to a na\""ive

Anomalous Cepheids, 199 RR Lyrae stars and 16 dwarf Cepheids in the field. This
is only the fifth extra-galactic systems in which dwarf Cepheids have been
systematically searched. Henceforth, the new stars increase the census of stars
coming from different environments that can be used to asses the advantages and
limitations of using dwarf Cepheids as standard candles in populations for
which the metallicity is not necessarily known. The dwarf Cepheids found in
Sextans have a mean period of 0.066 days, and a mean $g$ amplitude of 0.87
mags. They are located below the horizontal branch spanning a range of 0.8 mag,
between $21.9 < g < 22.7$. The number of dwarf Cepheids in Sextans is low
compared with other galaxies such as Carina, which have a strong
intermediate-age population. On the other hand, the number and ratio of RR
Lyrae stars to dwarf Cepheids is quite similar to Sculptor, a galaxy which, as
Sextans, is dominated by an old stellar population. The dwarf Cepheid stars
found in Sextans follow a well constrained Period-Luminosity relationship with
an rms=0.05 mag in the $g$ band, which was set up by anchoring to the distance
modulus given by the RR Lyrae stars. Although the majority of the variable
stars in Sextans are located toward the center of the galaxy, we have found 2
RR Lyrae stars and 1 Anomalous Cepheid in the outskirts of the galaxy, which
may be extra-tidal stars and suggest this galaxy may be undergoing tidal
destruction. These possible extra-tidal variable stars share the same proper
motions as Sextans, as seen by recent Gaia measurements.

considering the modeling of diverse, imaginative, and reasonable music pieces
in the style different from their original one. To achieve this, learning
stable multi-modal representations for both domain-variant (i.e., style) and
domain-invariant (i.e., content) information of music in an unsupervised manner
is critical. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised music style transfer
method without the need for parallel data. Besides, to characterize the
multi-modal distribution of music pieces, we employ the Multi-modal
Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation (MUNIT) framework in the proposed
system. This allows one to generate diverse outputs from the learned latent
distributions representing contents and styles. Moreover, to better capture the
granularity of sound, such as the perceptual dimensions of timbre and the
nuance in instrument-specific performance, cognitively plausible features
including mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), spectral difference, and
spectral envelope, are combined with the widely-used mel-spectrogram into a
timber-enhanced multi-channel input representation. The Relativistic average
Generative Adversarial Networks (RaGAN) is also utilized to achieve fast
convergence and high stability. We conduct experiments on bilateral style
transfer tasks among three different genres, namely piano solo, guitar solo,
and string quartet. Results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method
in music style transfer with improved sound quality and in allowing users to
manipulate the output.

first large-scale database suitable for 3D car instance understanding -
ApolloCar3D. The dataset contains 5,277 driving images and over 60K car
instances, where each car is fitted with an industry-grade 3D CAD model with
absolute model size and semantically labelled keypoints. This dataset is above
20 times larger than PASCAL3D+ and KITTI, the current state-of-the-art. To
enable efficient labelling in 3D, we build a pipeline by considering 2D-3D
keypoint correspondences for a single instance and 3D relationship among

algorithms with the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks.
Specifically, we first segment each car with a pre-trained Mask R-CNN, and then
regress towards its 3D pose and shape based on a deformable 3D car model with

improves fitting performance. Finally, we develop a new 3D metric jointly

and quantum communications substantially rely on quantum entanglement
formation. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that dissipation destroys
quantum coherence, coupling with a dissipative environment can also generate
entanglement. We consider a system composed of two quantum dot qubits coupled
with a common, damped surface plasmon mode; each quantum dot is also coupled to
a separate photonic cavity mode. Cavity quantum electrodynamics calculations
show that upon optical excitation by a femtosecond laser pulse, entanglement of
the quantum dot excitons occurs, and the time evolution of the $g^{(2)}$ pair
correlation function of the cavity photons is an indicator of the entanglement.
We also show that the degree of entanglement is conserved during the time
evolution of the system. Furthermore, if coupling of the photonic cavity and
quantum dot modes is large enough, the quantum dot entanglement can be
transferred to the cavity modes to increase the overall entanglement lifetime.

First, they constitute a distinct type of galactic systems, with their own
evolution histories and underlying physical processes; secondly, they probe
little-chartered regions of parameter space, as they have baryonic masses
similar to massive galaxies, and similar velocity dispersions, but much larger
sizes -- similar to cluster cores (or even to clusters), but much lower
dispersions. Importantly in the context of MOND, they have the lowest internal
accelerations reachable inside galactic systems. I analyze a sample of 56
medium-richness groups having a large number ($\ge 15$) of members with
measured velocities. The groups obey the deep-MOND,
baryonic-mass-velocity-dispersion relation, $M_MGa_0=(81/4)\sigma^4$, with
individual, MOND $M_M/L_K$ ratios of order $1$ solar unit, with
$(M_M/L_K)_{median}=0.7$ s.u. compared with the much larger Newtonian $M_d/L_K$
-- several tens s.u., and $(M_d/L_K)_{median}=37$ s.u. The same MOND relation
describes dwarf spheroidals -- 2-3 orders smaller in size, and 7-8 orders lower
in mass. The groups conformation to the MOND relation is equivalent to their
lying on the deep-MOND branch of the `acceleration-discrepancy relation',
$g\approx (g_N a_0)^{1/2}$, for $g$ as low as a few percents of $a_0$ ($g_N$ is
the baryonic, Newtonian, gravitational acceleration, and $g$ the actual one).
This argues against a breakdown of MOND at extremely low accelerations. This
conformation also argues against the hypothesis that the remaining MOND
conundrum in cluster cores bespeaks a breakdown of MOND on large-distance
scales; our groups are as large as cluster cores, but do not show obvious
disagreement with MOND. I also discuss the possible presence of the
idiosyncratic, MOND external-field effect.

non-metal terminated tips, e.g. oxygen-terminated copper, are well-suited for
enhanced temporal resolution up to video rate imaging velocities while
preserving picometer range spatial resolution. Contrarily, the
highest-attainable spatial resolution of atomically-engineered tips with
low-stiffness, e.g. CO-terminated, deteriorate with increasing imaging
velocity. Our results reveal that when atomically-engineered tips terminated

between Gaussian and exponential, which we call $p$-exponential measures. We
study their measure-theoretic properties and in particular their concentration.
Our findings are used to develop a general contraction theory of posterior
distributions on nonparametric models with $p$-exponential priors in separable
Banach parameter spaces. Our approach builds on the general contraction theory
for Gaussian process priors in van der Vaart and van Zanten 2008, namely we use
prior concentration to verify prior mass and entropy conditions sufficient for
posterior contraction. However, the specific concentration properties of
$p$-exponential priors lead to a more complex entropy bound which can influence
negatively the obtained rate of contraction, depending on the topology of the
parameter space. Subject to the more complex entropy bound, we show that the
rate of contraction depends on the position of the true parameter relative to a
certain Banach space associated to $p$-exponential measures and on the small
ball probabilities of these measures. For example, we apply our theory in the
white noise model under Besov regularity of the truth and obtain minimax rates
of contraction using (rescaled) $\alpha$-regular $p$-exponential priors. In
particular, our results suggest that when interested in spatially inhomogeneous
unknown functions, in terms of posterior contraction, it is preferable to use
Laplace rather than Gaussian priors.

composite estimation method to produce statistics on employment from the

estimators are linear combinations of monthly survey weighted averages (called
month-in-sample estimates) in each rotation groups. Denoting by $X$ the vector
of month-in-sample estimates and by $\Sigma$ its design based variance, the
coefficients of the linear combination were optimized by the Census Bureau
after substituting $\Sigma$ by an estimate and under unrealistic stationarity
assumptions. To show the limits of this approach, we compared the AK estimator
with different competitors using three different synthetic populations that
mimics the Current Population Survey (CPS) data and a simplified sample design
that mimics the CPS design. In our simulation setup, empirically best
estimators have larger mean square error than simple averages. In the real data
analysis, the AK estimates are constantly below the survey-weighted estimates,
indicating potential bias. Any attempt to improve on the estimated optimal
estimator in either class would require a thorough investigation of the highly
non-trivial problem of estimation of $\Sigma$ for a complex setting like the
CPS (we did not entertain this problem in this paper). A different approach is
to use a variant of the regression composite estimator used by Statistics
Canada. The regression composite estimator does not require estimation of
$\Sigma$ and is less sensitive to the rotation group bias in our simulations.
Our study demonstrates that there is a great potential for improving the
estimation of levels and month to month changes in the unemployment rates by
using the regression composite estimator.

physical model for the void-galaxy cross-correlation function projected along

void-centric angular distances and redshift differences between void-galaxy
pairs, hence it is not necessary to assume a fiducial cosmology. This model
reproduces the coupled dynamical (Kaiser effect, RSD) and geometrical
(Alcock-Paczynski effect, GD) distortions that affect the correlation
measurements. It also takes into account the scale mixing due to the projection
ranges in both directions. The model is general, so it can be applied to an
arbitrary cylindrical binning scheme, not only in the case of the projected
correlations. It primarily depends on two cosmological parameters: $\Omega_m$,
the matter fraction of the Universe today (sensitive to GD), and $\beta$, the
ratio between the growth rate factor of density perturbations and the tracer
bias (sensitive to RSD). In the context of the new generation of galaxy
spectroscopic surveys, we calibrated the test using the Millennium XXL
simulation for different redshifts. The method successfully recovers the
cosmological parameters. We studied the effect of measuring with different
projection ranges, finding robust results up to wide ranges. The resulting data
covariance matrices are relatively small, which reduces the noise in the
Gaussian likelihood analysis and will allow the usage of a smaller number of
mock catalogues. The performance evaluated in this work indicates that the

shown to them. As a result, models trained on linguistic features derived from
such datasets may not be generalizable across tasks. Building on prior work
demonstrating that same-task data of healthy participants helps improve AD
detection on a single-task dataset of pathological speech, we augment an
AD-specific dataset consisting of subjects describing a picture with multi-task
healthy data. We demonstrate that normative data from multiple speech-based
tasks helps improve AD detection by up to 9%. Visualization of decision
boundaries reveals that models trained on a combination of structured picture
descriptions and unstructured conversational speech have the least out-of-task
error and show the most potential to generalize to multiple tasks. We analyze
the impact of age of the added samples and if they affect fairness in
classification. We also provide explanations for a possible inductive bias
effect across tasks using model-agnostic feature anchors. This work highlights
the need for heterogeneous datasets for encoding changes in multiple facets of
cognition and for developing a task-independent AD detection model.

orbit of the suspension flow and act by dyadic piecewise linear homeomorphisms
in the flow direction. We show that if the system is minimal, the group is

straightforward examples of finitely generated simple left-orderable groups. We
show that if the system is minimal, every action of the corresponding group on
the circle has a fixed point. These constitute the first examples of finitely

in regions severely impacted by RFI. We report on our in-depth testing of an
automated spectral line source finder to produce HI total intensity maps which
we present side-by-side with significance maps to evaluate the reliability of
the morphology recovered by the source finder. We recommend that this become a
common place manner of presenting data from upcoming HI surveys of resolved
objects. We use the COSMOS 20k group catalogue, and we extract filamentary
structure using the topological DisPerSE algorithm to evaluate the \hi\
morphology in the context of both local and large-scale environments and we
discuss the shortcomings of both methods. Many of the detections show disturbed
HI morphologies suggesting they have undergone a recent interaction which is
not evident from deep optical imaging alone. Overall, the sample showcases the
broad range of ways in which galaxies interact with their environment. This is
a first look at the population of galaxies and their local and large-scale
environments observed in HI by CHILES at redshifts beyond the z=0.1 Universe.

model, word2vec, for capturing meaningful relationships in ecological (complex
polyphonic) music. More precisely, the skip-gram version of word2vec is used to
model slices of music from a large corpus spanning eight musical genres. In
this newly learned vector space, a metric based on cosine distance is able to
distinguish between functional chord relationships, as well as harmonic
associations in the music. Evidence, based on cosine distance between
chord-pair vectors, suggests that an implicit circle-of-fifths exists in the
vector space. In addition, a comparison between pieces in different keys
reveals that key relationships are represented in word2vec space. These results
suggest that the newly learned embedded vector representation does in fact
capture tonal and harmonic characteristics of music, without receiving explicit
information about the musical content of the constituent slices. In order to
investigate whether proximity in the discovered space of embeddings is
indicative of `semantically-related' slices, we explore a music generation
task, by automatically replacing existing slices from a given piece of music
with new slices. We propose an algorithm to find substitute slices based on
spatial proximity and the pitch class distribution inferred in the chosen
subspace. The results indicate that the size of the subspace used has a
significant effect on whether slices belonging to the same key are selected. In
sum, the proposed word2vec model is able to learn music-vector embeddings that
capture meaningful tonal and harmonic relationships in music, thereby providing
a useful tool for exploring musical properties and comparisons across pieces,
as a potential input representation for deep learning models, and as a music
generation device.

equation in complex form. We can easily transform the equation, which describe
N-point gravitational lens, into polynomial equation that is convenient to use
for our research. In our work, we present lens mapping as a linear combination
of two mapping: complex analytical and identity mapping. Analytical mapping is
specified by analytical function (deflection function). We studied necessary
and sufficient conditions for the existence of deflection function and proved
some theorems. Deflection function is analytical, rational, its zeroes are
fixed points of lens mapping and their number is from 1 to N-1, poles of
deflection function are coordinates of point masses, all poles are simple, the
residues at the poles are equal to the value of point masses.\\ We used
Gauss-Lucas theorem and proved that all fixed points of lens mapping are in the

address the challenges on convergence analysis, we firstly consider to form a
global recursion relation over spatial and temporal scales since the
traditional GN is a time iterative method and the network-wide NLLS need to be
solved. Secondly, the derived recursion related to the networkwide deviation
between the successive two iterations is ambiguous due to the uncertainty of
descent discrepancy in GN update step between two versions of cooperation and
non-cooperation. Thus, an important work is to derive the boundedness
conditions of this discrepancy. Finally, based on the temporal-spatial

allow the development of promising tools in several application domains. In
medical training and simulation the learning potential of AR is significantly
amplified by the capability of the system to present 3D medical models in
real-time at remote locations. Furthermore the simulation applicability is
broadened by the use of real-time deformable medical models. This work presents
a distributed medical training prototype designed to train medical
practitioners' hand-eye coordination when performing endotracheal intubations.
The system we present accomplishes this task with the help of AR paradigms. An
extension of this prototype to medical simulations by employing deformable
medical models is possible. The shared state maintenance of the collaborative
AR environment is assured through a novel adaptive synchronization algorithm
(ASA) that increases the sense of presence among participants and facilitates
their interactivity in spite of infrastructure delays. The system will allow
paramedics, pre-hospital personnel, and students to practice their skills
without touching a real patient and will provide them with the visual feedback
they could not otherwise obtain. Such a distributed AR training tool has the
potential to: allow an instructor to simultaneously train local and remotely
located students and, allow students to actually ""see"" the internal anatomy and
therefore better understand their actions on a human patient simulator (HPS).

the center-of-mass energy of 1.5 TeV. The assumed signal process is highly
motivated by the enhancements in the $A/H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ decays at
relatively high $\tb$ values. Such enhancements result in the dominance of the
mentioned decay modes even for Higgs masses above the threshold of the on-shell
top quark pair production. Taking advantage of such a unique feature, several
benchmark scenarios are studied. Simulating the detector response based on the
SiD detector at the ILC, simulated events are analyzed to reconstruct the $H$
and $A$ Higgs bosons. The top quark pair production and $Z/\gamma$ production
are the main SM background processes and are well under control. Results
indicate that, the $H$ and $A$ Higgs bosons are observable with signals
exceeding $5\sigma$ with possibility of mass measurement in all the tested
scenarios. Specifically, the parameter space region enclosed with the mass

LQ-controller in the feedback mode is employed to mitigate noise and

The model employs a closure using a mixing length model. Its link to

consistently manifests a pattern of meta-stable quasi-periodic configurations,
lasting for hundreds of time units, yet interspersed with abrupt ($\Delta
t\ll1$) mergers of adjacent steps in the staircase. The mergers occur at the
staircase lattice defects where the pattern has not completely relaxed to a
strictly periodic solution that can be obtained analytically. Other types of
stationary solutions are solitons and kinks in the PV gradient and
$\varepsilon$ - profiles. The waiting time between mergers increases strongly
as the number of steps in the staircase decreases. This is because of an
exponential decrease in inter-step coupling strength with growing spacing. The
long-time staircase dynamics is shown numerically be determined by local
interaction with adjacent steps. Mergers reveal themselves through the
explosive growth of the turbulent PV-flux which, however, abruptly drops to its
global constant value once the merger is completed.

bi-dimensional street canyon have been investigated experimentally in a wind
tunnel in combination with differential wall heating. Laser-Doppler anemometry
together with a fast flame ionisation detector and cold-wire anemometry were
employed to sample velocities, concentration, temperatures and fluxes.
  A single-vortex pattern was observed in the isothermal case, preserved also
in the leeward case, but with an increment of the vortex speed. Heating the
windward wall was found to generate a counter-rotating vortex, resulting in the
reduction of velocity within the canopy. The stable stratification also
contributes reducing the speed, but only in the lower half of the canyon. The
largest values of turbulent kinetic energy were observed above the canopy,
while inside they were concentrated close to the windward wall, even when the
leeward one was heated. An incoming stable stratification produced a turbulence
reduction in all the cases. Windward heating was found to produce larger
temperature increments within the canopy, while in the leeward case heat was
immediately vacated above the canopy. A stable approaching flow reduced both
temperatures and heat fluxes.
  A passive tracer was released from a ground-level point source at the centre
of the canyon. The plume cross-section was mostly affected by the windward wall
heating, which produced an increment of the pollutant concentration on the
windward side by breaking the main vortex. The stable stratification created a
generalised increment of pollutant within the canopy, with concentrations twice
as large. Turbulent pollutant fluxes were found significant only at roof level
and close to the source. On the other hand, in the windward wall-heated case
the reduction of the mean flux renders the turbulent component relevant in
other locations as well.

but the ""Japanese"" problem is much harder than the ""Chinese"" one, since the

only for a few ""Japanese"" tangram shapes their solutions can be found by a

to the utmost level. The dynamic system and subsystem partitioning enable
tracking the evolution of the initial stocks, environmental inputs, and
intercompartmental system flows, as well as the associated storages derived
from these stocks, inputs, and flows individually and separately within the
system. Moreover, the transient and the dynamic direct, indirect, acyclic,

given flow path or from one compartment, directly or indirectly, to any other
are analytically characterized, systematically classified, and mathematically
formulated. Further, the article develops a dynamic technique based on the
diact transactions for the quantitative classification of interspecific
interactions and the determination of their strength within food webs. Major
concepts and quantities of the current static network analyses are also
extended to nonlinear dynamic settings and integrated with the proposed dynamic
measures and indices within the proposed unifying mathematical framework.
Therefore, the proposed methodology enables a holistic view and analysis of
ecological systems. We consider that this methodology brings a novel complex

analysis of samples of nearby SLSNe-I and lower-luminosity events, a threshold
of M_g<-19.8 mag at peak appears to separate SLSNe-I from the normal
population. SLSN-I light curves can be quite complex, presenting both early
bumps and late post-peak undulations. SLSNe-I spectroscopically evolve from an
early hot photospheric phase with a blue continuum and weak absorption lines,
through a cool photospheric phase resembling spectra of SNe Ic, and into the
late nebular phase. SLSNe-II are not nearly as well studied, lacking
information based on large sample studies. Proposed models for the SLSN power
source are challenged to explain all the observations. SLSNe arise from massive
progenitors, with some events associated with very massive stars (M>40 solar).
Host galaxies of SLSNe in the nearby universe tend to have low mass and
sub-solar metallicity. SLSNe are rare, with rates <100 times lower than
ordinary SNe. SLSN cosmology and their use as beacons to study the
high-redshift universe offer exciting future prospects.

of hypnosis during induction phase in clinical anesthesia. In contrast with
existing control schemes for propofol delivery, the proposed scheme guarantees
overdosing prevention while ensuring good performance. The core idea is to
reformulate overdosing prevention as a constraint, and then use the recently
introduced Explicit Reference Governor to enforce the constraint satisfaction
at all times. The proposed scheme is evaluated in comparison with a robust PID
controller on a simulated surgical procedure for 44 patients whose
Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic models have been identified using clinical
data. The results demonstrate that the proposed constrained control scheme can
deliver propofol to yield good induction phase response while preventing
overdosing in patients; whereas other existing schemes might cause overdosing
in some patients. Simulations show that mean rise time, mean settling time, and
mean overshoot of less than 5 [min], 8 [min], and 10%, respectively, are
achieved, which meet typical anesthesiologists' response specifications.

remarkable progress. A missing ingredient, however, is the ability to
automatically evaluate point-wise importance w.r.t.\! classification
performance, which is usually reflected by a saliency map. A saliency map is an
important tool as it allows one to perform further processes on point-cloud
data. In this paper, we propose a novel way of characterizing critical points
and segments to build point-cloud saliency maps. Our method assigns each point
a score reflecting its contribution to the model-recognition loss. The saliency
map explicitly explains which points are the key for model recognition.
Furthermore, aggregations of highly-scored points indicate important
segments/subsets in a point-cloud. Our motivation for constructing a saliency
map is by point dropping, which is a non-differentiable operator. To overcome
this issue, we approximate point-dropping with a differentiable procedure of
shifting points towards the cloud centroid. Consequently, each saliency score
can be efficiently measured by the corresponding gradient of the loss w.r.t the
point under the spherical coordinates. Extensive evaluations on several
state-of-the-art point-cloud recognition models, including PointNet, PointNet++
and DGCNN, demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposed saliency

localized graph convolutions with two types of graph downsampling operations

sinusoidal signals is important for numerous fields. It is known that a
quiescent, deterministic system possessing a supercritical Hopf bifurcation is
more sensitive to sinusoidal stimuli the closer it operates to the bifurcation.
To understand signal detection in many natural settings, however, noise must be
taken into account. We study the Fokker-Planck equation describing the
sinusoidally forced dynamics of a noisy supercritical or subcritical Hopf
oscillator. To distinguish an oscillator's motion owing to sinusoidal forcing
from that provoked by noise, we employ the phase-locked amplitude and vector
strength, which are zero in the absence of an external signal. The phase-locked
amplitude and entrainment to frequency-detuned forcing but not resonant forcing
peak as functions of the control parameter. These peaks occur near but not at
the bifurcations. Moreover, an oscillator can detect stimuli over the broadest
frequency range when it spontaneously oscillates near a Hopf bifurcation.
Although noise exerts the greatest effect on the phase-locked amplitude when a
Hopf oscillator is near a Hopf bifurcation, the oscillator nevertheless
performs best as a sinusoidal-signal detector when it operates close to the
bifurcation. The oscillator's ability to differentiate detuned signals from
noise is greatest with it autonomously oscillates near to but not at the
bifurcation.

technological weapon-of-choice behind the success of Bitcoin and other

implementations continues to increase, adopters should focus on selecting the
best one to support their decentralized applications (dApps), rather than
developing new ones from scratch. In this paper we present a framework to aid
software architects, developers, tool selectors and decision makers to adopt
the right blockchain technology for their problem at hand. The framework
exposes the correlation between technological decisions and architectural
features, capturing the knowledge from existing industrial products, technical
forums/blogs, experts' feedback and academic literature; plus our own
experience using and developing blockchain-based applications. We validate our
framework by applying it to dissect the most outstanding blockchain platforms,
i.e., the ones behind the top 10 cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin. Then, we
show how we applied it to a real-world case study in the insurtech domain.

balance at the interfacial region. While electric field acts favourably to
spread a droplet on a rigid surface, this tendency may be significantly
suppressed over soft surfaces, considering a part of the interfacial energy
being utilized to deform the solid elastically by capillary forces. Here, we
bring out a unique mechanism by virtue of which addition of nano-particles to
the droplet brings in a favourable recovery of the electro-spreading
characteristics of a soft surface, by realizing an alteration in the effective
dielectric constant of the interfacial region. Our experiments further
demonstrate that this mechanism ceases to be operative beyond a threshold
volume fraction of the particle suspension, due to inevitable contact line
pinning. We also develop a theory to explain our experimental observations. Our
findings provide a non-contact mechanism for meniscus spreading and droplet
control, bearing far-reaching implications in biology and engineering.

  online, retrieves arbitrarily-shaped clusters, and mitigates order dependence",,,,,"cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a novel adaptive resonance theory (ART)-based modular
architecture for unsupervised learning, namely the distributed dual vigilance
fuzzy ART (DDVFA). DDVFA consists of a global ART system whose nodes are local
fuzzy ART modules. It is equipped with the distinctive features of distributed
higher-order activation and match functions, using dual vigilance parameters
responsible for cluster similarity and data quantization. Together, these allow
DDVFA to perform unsupervised modularization, create multi-prototype clustering
representations, retrieve arbitrarily-shaped clusters, and control its
compactness. Another important contribution is the reduction of
order-dependence, an issue that affects any agglomerative clustering method.
This paper demonstrates two approaches for mitigating order-dependence:
preprocessing using visual assessment of cluster tendency (VAT) or
postprocessing using a novel Merge ART module. The former is suitable for batch
processing, whereas the latter can be used in online learning. Experimental
results in the online learning mode carried out on 30 benchmark data sets show
that DDVFA cascaded with Merge ART statistically outperformed the best other
ART-based systems when samples were randomly presented. Conversely, they were
found to be statistically equivalent in the offline mode when samples were
pre-processed using VAT. Remarkably, performance comparisons to non-ART-based
clustering algorithms show that DDVFA (which learns incrementally) was also
statistically equivalent to the non-incremental (offline) methods of DBSCAN,
single linkage hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC), and k-means, while
retaining the appealing properties of ART. Links to the source code and data
are provided. Considering the algorithm's simplicity, online learning
capability, and performance, it is an ideal choice for many agglomerative
clustering applications.

kinetic energy and emission of longitudinal stress waves during the cavity
collapse. Here we report that cavitation in elastic solids may additionally
emit shear waves that could affect soft tissues in human bodies/brains. During
collapse of the cavity close to an air-solid boundary, the cavity moves away
from the boundary and forms a directed jet flow, which confines shear stresses
in a volume between the bubble and the free boundary. Elastographic and
high-speed imaging resolve this process and reveal the origin of a shear wave
in this region. Additionally, the gelatin surface deforms and a conical crack
evolves. We speculate that tissue fracture observed in medical therapy may be
linked to the non-spherical cavitation bubble collapse.

bending and buckling actuation. To predict the full non-linear piezoelectric
behavior, we measured the non-linear charge coefficient, hysteresis and creep
effects of the piezo material and inserted them into the FEM model using a
virtual electric field. We further included and discussed the fabrication
parameters -- glue layers and thermal stress -- and their variations. To verify
our simulations, we fabricated and measured a set of lenses with different
geometries, where we found good agreement and show that their qualitative
behavior is also well described by a simple analytical model. We finally
discuss the effects of the geometry on the electric response and find, e.g., an
increased focal power range from $\pm 4.5$ to $\pm 9\, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$ when
changing the aperture from $14$ to $10\, \mathrm{mm}$.
