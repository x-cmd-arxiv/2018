  Image Segmentation","9 pages, 11 Figs, 1 Table, Accepted by CVPR",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With pervasive applications of medical imaging in health-care, biomedical
image segmentation plays a central role in quantitative analysis, clinical
diagno- sis, and medical intervention. Since manual anno- tation su ers limited
reproducibility, arduous e orts, and excessive time, automatic segmentation is
desired to process increasingly larger scale histopathological data. Recently,
deep neural networks (DNNs), par- ticularly fully convolutional networks
(FCNs), have been widely applied to biomedical image segmenta- tion, attaining
much improved performance. At the same time, quantization of DNNs has become an
ac- tive research topic, which aims to represent weights with less memory
(precision) to considerably reduce memory and computation requirements of DNNs
while maintaining acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we apply quantization
techniques to FCNs for accurate biomedical image segmentation. Unlike existing
litera- ture on quantization which primarily targets memory and computation
complexity reduction, we apply quan- tization as a method to reduce over tting
in FCNs for better accuracy. Speci cally, we focus on a state-of- the-art
segmentation framework, suggestive annotation [22], which judiciously extracts
representative annota- tion samples from the original training dataset, obtain-
ing an e ective small-sized balanced training dataset. We develop two new
quantization processes for this framework: (1) suggestive annotation with
quantiza- tion for highly representative training samples, and (2) network
training with quantization for high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the
MICCAI Gland dataset show that both quantization processes can improve the
segmentation performance, and our proposed method exceeds the current
state-of-the-art performance by up to 1%. In addition, our method has a
reduction of up to 6.4x on memory usage.

Hall (AVHE) edge states in topological elastic waveguides. The fundamental
lattice is assembled based on a non-resonant unit where space inversion
symmetry (SIS) is broken by simply perturbing the underlying lattice geometry.
This aspect is in net contrast with existing elastic AVHE designs that exploit
locally-resonant units and require the addition of masses in order to break
SIS. The experimental results presented in this study validate findings so far
presented only at theoretical and numerical level. In particular, it is found
that edge modes can effectively propagate along domain walls between
topologically dissimilar domains and that disorder-induced backscattering is
substantially suppressed due to the weak coupling between oppositely
valley-polarized modes. The coupling between valley modes is also further
investigated and linked to an evident chiral flux of the mechanical energy.
Finally, we show that the weak coupling between the valleys can be exploited to
achieve selective mode injection at the domain wall, hence realizing a very
effective excitation strategy of the chiral edge states.

with decreasing thickness. This suppression is normally governed by either
disorder-induced localization of Cooper pairs, weakening of Coulomb screening,
or generation and unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs as described by the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) theory. Defying general expectations,
few-layer NbSe2 - an archetypal example of ultrathin superconductors - has been
found to remain superconducting down to monolayer thickness. Here we report
measurements of both the superconducting energy gap and critical temperature in
high-quality monocrystals of few-layer NbSe2, using planar-junction tunneling
spectroscopy and lateral transport. We observe a fully developed gap that
rapidly reduces for devices with the number of layers N < 5, as does their
ctitical temperature. We show that the observed reduction cannot be explained
by disorder, and the BKT mechanism is also excluded by measuring its transition
temperature that for all N remains very close to Tc. We attribute the observed
behavior to changes in the electronic band structure predicted for mono- and
bi- layer NbSe2 combined with inevitable suppression of the Cooper pair density
at the superconductor-vacuum interface. Our experimental results for N > 2 are
in good agreement with the dependences of the gap and Tc expected in the latter
case while the effect of band-structure reconstruction is evidenced by a
stronger suppression of the gap and the disappearance of its anisotropy for N =
2. The spatial scale involved in the surface suppression of the density of
states is only a few angstroms but cannot be ignored for atomically thin

proposed framework termed as HLLC-SWM (\textbf{S}elective \textbf{W}ave

inherent diffusive HLL component within the HLLC scheme in the vicinity of a
shock wave while leaving its antidiffusive component unmodified to retain
accuracy on linearly degenerate wavefields. We present two strategies to
compute the requisite supplementary dissipation which results in HLLC-SWM-E and
HLLC-SWM-P variants. Through a linear perturbation analysis of the HLLC-SWM
framework, we clarify how the additional dissipation introduced in this way
helps in damping of unphysical perturbations in primitive quantities under a
derived CFL constraint. A matrix based stability analysis of a steady
two-dimensional normal shock is used to show that both variants of the HLLC-SWM
scheme are shock stable over a wide range of inlet Mach numbers. Results from
standard test cases demonstrate that the HLLC-SWM schemes are capable of
computing shock stable solutions on a variety of problems while retaining
positivity and exact inviscid contact ability. On viscous flows, while the

$\kappa_0 \approx 5.6158$ is defined explicitly. This gives a partial answer to
a problem posed by Duplantier, Miller and Sheffield (2014). Our proof in fact
yields a stronger connectivity result for $\kappa \in (4,\kappa_0]$, which says
that there is a Markovian way of finding a path from any fixed bubble to
$\infty$. We also show that there is a (non-explicit) $\kappa_1 \in (\kappa_0,

  Our proofs are based on an encoding of SLE$_\kappa$ in terms of a pair of

to a problem about stable processes. In fact, due to this encoding, our results
can be re-phrased as statements about the connectivity of the adjacency graph

This problem is a natural generalization of the extensively-studied kPath

parameterized universal approximators. As such, the value of the parameters is
unimportant, and only the out of sample performance is considered. On the other
hand much of the literature on model estimation assumes that the parameters
themselves have intrinsic value, and thus is concerned with bias and variance
of parameter estimates, which may not have any simple relationship to out of
sample model performance. Therefore, within supervised machine learning, heavy
use is made of ridge regression (i.e., L2 regularization), which requires the
the estimation of hyperparameters and can be rendered ineffective by certain
model parameterizations. We introduce an objective function which we refer to
as Information-Corrected Estimation (ICE) that reduces KL divergence based
generalization error for supervised machine learning. ICE attempts to directly
maximize a corrected likelihood function as an estimator of the KL divergence.
Such an approach is proven, theoretically, to be effective for a wide class of

corrected estimation procedure is shown experimentally to lead to significant
reduction in generalization error compared to maximum likelihood estimation and

Specifically, we consider fluctuating lines under tension (e.g., polymer or

At equilibrium, the lines acquire a collective tilt proportional to an integer

against substrate disorder, as verified by classical Langevin dynamics
simulations. This robustness arises because excitations in this system of
thermally fluctuating lines are gapped by virtue of inter-line interactions. We
establish the topological underpinning of this pattern via a mapping that we

  antidiffusion control",,,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Various forms of numerical shock instabilities are known to plague many
contact and shear preserving approximate Riemann solvers, including the popular
Harten-Lax-van Leer with Contact (HLLC) scheme, during high speed flow
simulations. In this paper we propose a simple and inexpensive novel strategy
to prevent the HLLC scheme from developing such spurious solutions without
compromising on its linear wave resolution ability. The cure is primarily based
on a reinterpretation of the HLLC scheme as a combination of its well-known
diffusive counterpart, the HLL scheme, and an antidiffusive term responsible
for its accuracy on linear wavefields. In our study, a linear analysis of this
alternate form indicates that shock instability in the HLLC scheme could be
triggered due to the unwanted activation of the antidiffusive terms of its mass
and interface-normal flux components on interfaces that are not aligned with
the shock front. This inadvertent activation results in weakening of the
favourable dissipation provided by its inherent HLL scheme and causes
unphysical mass flux variations along the shock front. To mitigate this, we
propose a modified HLLC scheme that employs a simple differentiable pressure
based multidimensional shock sensor to achieve smooth control of these critical
antidiffusive terms near shocks. Using a linear perturbation analysis and a
matrix based stability analysis, we establish that the resulting scheme, called
HLLC-ADC (Anti-Diffusion Control), is shock stable over a wide range of
freestream Mach numbers. Results from standard numerical test cases demonstrate
that the HLLC-ADC scheme is indeed free from the most common manifestations of
shock instability including the Carbuncle phenomenon without significant loss
of accuracy on shear dominated viscous flows.

Considering samples of grouped and ungrouped galaxies, we find the
$\mathrm{sSFR}-M_*$ relations of disk-dominated central galaxies to have no
detectable dependence on host dark-matter halo (DMH) mass, even where
weak-lensing measurements indicate a difference in halo mass of a factor
$\gtrsim5$. We further detect a gradual evolution of the $\mathrm{sSFR}-M_*$
relation of non-grouped (field) central disk galaxies with redshift, even over
a $\Delta z \approx 0.04$ ($\approx5\cdot10^{8}\mathrm{yr}$) interval, while
the scatter remains constant. This evolution is consistent with extrapolation
of the ""main-sequence-of-star-forming-galaxies"" from previous literature that
uses larger redshift baselines and coarser sampling.
  Taken together, our results present new constraints on the paradigm under
which the SFR of galaxies is determined by a self-regulated balance between gas
inflows and outflows, and consumption of gas by star-formation in disks, with
the inflow being determined by the product of the cosmological accretion rate
and a fuelling-efficiency -- $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{b,halo}}\zeta$. In particular,
maintaining the paradigm requires $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{b,halo}}\zeta$ to be
independent of the mass $M_{\mathrm{halo}}$ of the host DMH. Furthermore, it
requires the fuelling-efficiency $\zeta$ to have a strong redshift dependence
($\propto (1+z)^{2.7}$ for $M_*=10^{10.3} M_{\odot}$ over $z=0 - 0.13$), even
though no morphological transformation to spheroids can be invoked to explain
this in our disk-dominated sample. The physical mechanisms capable of giving
rise to such dependencies of $\zeta$ on $M_{\mathrm{halo}}$ and $z$ for disks

stellar rotation, a stellar population model for the galaxy, and prescriptions
for observational bias and confusion to predict the rotation distribution in
the Kepler field under standard ""vanilla"" assumptions. We arrive at two central
conclusions: first, that standard braking models fail to reproduce the observed
distribution at long periods, and second, that the interpretation of the period
distribution is complicated by mixtures of unevolved and evolved stars and
observational uncertainties. By assuming that the amplitude and thus
detectability of rotational signatures is tied to the Rossby number, we show
that the observed period distribution contains an apparent ""Rossby edge"" at
$\textrm{Ro}_{thresh} = 2.08$, above which long-period, high-Rossby number
stars are either absent or undetected. This $\textrm{Ro}_{thresh}$ is
comparable to the Rossby number at which van Saders et al. (2016) observed the
onset of weakened magnetic braking, and suggests either that this modified
braking is in operation in the full Kepler population, or that stars undergo a
transition in spottedness and activity at a very similar Rossby number. We

of magnitude in mass, ~5 orders of magnitude in central galaxy star formation
rate (SFR), ~4 orders of magnitude in the classical cooling rate (dM/dt) of the
intracluster medium (ICM), and ~5 orders of magnitude in the central black hole
accretion rate. For each system in this sample, we measure dM/dt using archival
Chandra X-ray data and acquire the SFR and systematic uncertainty in the SFR by
combining over 330 estimates from dozens of literature sources. With these
data, we estimate the efficiency with which the ICM cools and forms stars,
finding e_cool = SFR/(dM/dt) = 1.4 +/- 0.4% for systems with dM/dt > 30
Msun/yr. For these systems, we measure a slope in the SFR-dM/dt relation
greater than unity, suggesting that the systems with the strongest cool cores
are also cooling more efficiently. We propose that this may be related to, on
average, higher black hole accretion rates in the strongest cool cores, which
could influence the total amount (saturating near the Eddington rate) and
dominant mode (mechanical vs radiative) of feedback. For systems with dM/dt <
30 Msun/yr, we find that the SFR and dM/dt are uncorrelated, and show that this
is consistent with star formation being fueled at a low (but dominant) level by
recycled ISM gas in these systems. We find an intrinsic log-normal scatter in
SFR at fixed dM/dt of 0.52 +/- 0.06 dex, suggesting that cooling is tightly
self-regulated over very long timescales, but can vary dramatically on short
timescales. There is weak evidence that this scatter may be related to the
feedback mechanism, with the scatter being minimized (~0.4 dex) in systems for
which the mechanical feedback power is within a factor of two of the cooling
luminosity.

correspondence: this structure should reproduce spacetime, general relativity,
and quantum field theory in a limit of weak gravitational fields. A central
question is that of ""Einstein separability,"" and asks how to define mutually
independent subsystems, e.g. through localization. Familiar definitions
involving tensor products or operator subalgebras do not clearly accomplish
this in gravity, as is seen in the correspondence limit. Instead, gravitational
behavior, particularly gauge invariance, suggests a network of Hilbert
subspaces related via inclusion maps, contrasting with other approaches based
on tensor-factorized Hilbert spaces. Any such localization structure is also
expected to place strong constraints on evolution, which are also supplemented
by the constraint of unitarity.

Along the way, we present an estimator for reconstructing long-wavelength

After applying bias-hardening, we find that a detection of the lensing

clustering or cosmic shear from a large photometric survey look promising,
provided that systematics can be sufficiently controlled. We reach similar
conclusions for a single-dish survey inspired by CII measurements planned for

separated electron and hole pockets of similar sizes, centered at certain

spin-density-wave (SDW) magnetism. We show that SDW order is degenerate at the
mean-field level. Beyond mean-field, the degeneracy is lifted and is either
$120^{\circ}$ ""triangular"" order (same as for localized spins), or a collinear
order with antiferromagnetic spin arrangement on two-thirds of sites, and
non-magnetic on the rest of sites. We also study a time-reversal symmetric
directional spin bond order, which emerges when some interactions are repulsive
and some are attractive. We show that this order is also degenerate at a
mean-field level, but beyond mean-field the degeneracy is again lifted. We next
consider the evolution of a magnetic order in a magnetic field starting from an
SDW state in zero field. We show that a field gives rise to a canting of an SDW
spin configuration. In addition, it necessarily triggers the directional bond
order, which, we argue, is linearly coupled to the SDW order in a finite field.
We derive the corresponding term in the Free energy. Finally, we consider the
interplay between an SDW order and superconductivity and charge order. For
this, we analyze the flow of the couplings within parquet renormalization group
(pRG) scheme. We show that magnetism wins if all interactions are repulsive and
there is little energy space for pRG to develop. However, if system parameters
are such that pRG runs over a wide range of energies, the system may develop
either superconductivity or an unconventional charge order, which breaks

has received high resolution spectral imaging during the Cassini flyby. We
present a new analysis of the Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer observations
of Phoebe, which critically, includes a geometry correction routine that
enables pixel-by-pixel mapping of visible and infrared spectral cubes directly
onto the Phoebe shape model, even when an image exhibits significant trailing
errors. The result of our re-analysis is a successful match of 40 images,
producing spectral maps covering the majority of Phoebe's surface, roughly a
3rd of which is imaged by high resolution observations (<22 km per pixel
resolution). There is no spot on Phoebe's surface that is absent of water
absorption. The regions richest in water are clearly associated with the Jason
and South Pole impact basins. We find Phoebe exhibits only three spectral
types, and a water-ice concentration that correlates with physical depth and
visible albedo. The water-rich and water-poor regions exhibit significantly
different crater size frequency distributions, and different large crater
morphologies. We propose that Phoebe once had a water-poor surface whose
water-ice concentration was enhanced by basin forming impacts which exposed
richer subsurface layers. Finally, we demonstrate that the range of Phoebe's
water-ice absorption spans the same range exhibited by dynamically excited
Kuiper Belt Objects. The common water-ice absorption depths and primordial
origins, and the association of Phoebe's water-rich regions with its impact

existence of quantum critical points described by an emergent tensor gauge
theory featuring subdimensional excitations, in close relation to fracton
theories. We begin by reexamining a previously studied deconfined quantum
critical point between two valence bond solid (VBS) phases on a bilayer
honeycomb lattice. We show that the critical theory maps onto a rank-two tensor
gauge theory featuring one-dimensional particles. In a slightly different
context, the same tensor gauge theory also describes a deconfined quantum
critical point between a two-dimensional superfluid and a finite-momentum Bose
condensate, both of which are dual to rank-one gauge theories. This represents
an entirely new class of deconfined quantum criticality, in which a critical
tensor gauge theory arises on top of a stable conventional gauge theory.
Furthermore, we propose that this quantum critical point gives rise to a new
finite-temperature phase of bosons, behaving as an exciton Bose condensate, in
which excitons (boson-hole pairs) are condensed but individual bosons are not.
We discuss how small modifications of this theory give rise to the stable

tidal disruption events, to extended massive stars, such as blue super giants

supercurrent passing through the graphene-based Josephson junctions. We show in
the presence of a constant pseudomagnetic field ${\bf B}_S$ originated from an
arc-shape elastic deformation, the Josephson current is monotonically enhanced.
This is in contrast with the oscillatory behavior of supercurrent (known as
Fraunhofer pattern) caused by real magnetic fields passing through the
junction. The absence of oscillatory supercurrent originates from the fact that
strain-induced gauge fields have opposite directions at the two valleys due to
the time-reversal symmetry. Subsequently there is no net Aharonov-Bohm effect
due to ${\bf B}_S$ in the current carried by the bound states composed of
electrons and holes from different valleys. On the other hand, when both
magnetic and pseudomagnetic fields are present, Fraunhofer-like oscillations as
function of the real magnetic field flux are found. We find that the Fraunhofer
pattern and in particular its period slightly change by varying the
strain-induced gauge field as well as the geometric aspect ratio of the
junction. Intriguingly, the combination of two kinds of gauge fields results in
two special fingerprint in the local current density profile: (i) strong
localization of the Josephson current density with more intense maximum
amplitudes; (ii) appearance of the inflated vortex cores - finite regions with
almost diminishing Josephson currents - which their sizes increases by
increasing ${\bf B}_S$. These findings reveal unexpected interference
signatures of strain-induced gauge fields in graphene SNS junctions and provide
unique tools for sensitive probing of the pseudomagnetic fields.

observe the full suite of transiting planet characterization geometries

transiting exoplanet studies. Community engagement in the project will be

is detected towards V4046 Sgr, MWC 480, and HD 163296. Rotational temperatures
derived for disks with multiple detected lines range from 29-73K, indicating
emission from the temperate molecular layer of the disk. V4046 Sgr and MWC 480
radial abundance profiles are constrained using a parametric model; the
gas-phase CH3CN and HC3N abundances with respect to HCN are a few to tens of
percent in the inner 100 AU of the disk, signifying a rich nitrile chemistry at
planet- and comet-forming disk radii. We find consistent relative abundances of
CH3CN, HC3N, and HCN between our disk sample, protostellar envelopes, and solar
system comets; this is suggestive of a robust nitrile chemistry with similar

unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. In spite of these technical
advances, many lines of interest are still at best weakly detected and
therefore necessitate detection and analysis techniques specialized for the low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Matched filters can leverage knowledge of
the source structure and kinematics to increase sensitivity of spectral line
observations. Application of the filter in the native Fourier domain improves
SNR while simultaneously avoiding the computational cost and ambiguities
associated with imaging, making matched filtering a fast and robust method for
weak spectral line detection. We demonstrate how an approximate matched filter
can be constructed from a previously observed line or from a model of the
source, and we show how this filter can be used to robustly infer a detection
significance for weak spectral lines. When applied to ALMA Cycle 2 observations
of CH3OH in the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya, the technique yields a ~53%
SNR boost over aperture-based spectral extraction methods, and we show that an
even higher boost will be achieved for observations at higher spatial
resolution. A Python-based open-source implementation of this technique is

bidirectional GRU network. The encoder effectively captures both short-term and
long-term spatio-temporal information. More importantly, LCANet incorporates a
cascaded attention-CTC decoder to generate output texts. By cascading CTC with
attention, it partially eliminates the defect of the conditional independence
assumption of CTC within the hidden neural layers, and this yields notably
performance improvement as well as faster convergence. The experimental results

holographic CFTs of arbitrary odd dimensions in the context of the AdS/CFT

renormalized Entanglement Entropy thus obtained can be rewritten in terms of
the Euler characteristic and the AdS curvature of the minimal surface. This
prescription considers the use of the Replica Trick to express the renormalized
Entanglement Entropy in terms of the renormalized gravitational action
evaluated on the conically-singular replica manifold extended to the bulk. This
renormalized action is obtained in turn by adding the Chern form as the
counterterm at the boundary of the 2n-dimensional asymptotically AdS bulk
manifold. We explicitly show that, up to next-to-leading order in the
holographic radial coordinate, the addition of this boundary term cancels the
divergent part of the Entanglement Entropy. We discuss possible applications of

tractable, including reward shaping, curriculum learning and using a policy
pre-trained on a task with a reduced action set to warm-start the full problem.
For efficient and more flexible data collection, we train in simulation and
transfer the policies to a real robot. We show that using curriculum learning,
policies learned with a sparse reward formulation can be trained at similar
rates as with a shaped reward. These policies result in success rates
comparable to the policy initialized on the simplified task. We could
successfully transfer these policies to the real robot with only minor
modifications of the depth image filtering. We found that using a heuristic to
warm-start the training was useful to enforce desired behavior, while the
policies trained from scratch using a curriculum learned better to cope with
unseen scenarios where objects are removed.

often require a collision-free shortest path to be computed quickly given a
roadmap graph. Typically, the computational cost of evaluating whether an edge
of the roadmap graph is collision-free dominates the running time of search
algorithms. Algorithms such as Lazy Weighted A* (LWA*) and LazySP have been
proposed to reduce the number of edge evaluations by employing a lazy lookahead
(one-step lookahead and infinite-step lookahead, respectively). However, this
comes at the expense of additional graph operations: the larger the lookahead,
the more the graph operations that are typically required. We propose Lazy
Receding-Horizon A* (LRA*) to minimize the total planning time by balancing
edge evaluations and graph operations. Endowed with a lazy lookahead, LRA*
represents a family of lazy shortest-path graph-search algorithms that
generalizes LWA* and LazySP. We analyze the theoretic properties of LRA* and
demonstrate empirically that, in many cases, to minimize the total planning
time, the algorithm requires an intermediate lazy lookahead. Namely, using an
intermediate lazy lookahead, our algorithm outperforms both LWA* and LazySP.

We characterize the interplay between rankers and spammers as a game. We define
the two critical features of this game, spam resistance and distortion, based
on how spammers spam and how rankers protect against spam. We observe that all
the ranking functions that are well-studied in the literature, including the
original formulation of PageRank, have poor spam resistance, poor distortion,

A secondary benefit is that Min-PPR comes with an explicit cost function on
nodes that shows how important they are to the spammer; thus a ranker can focus
their spam-detection capacity on these vulnerable nodes. Both Min-PPR and its

individual X-ray halos, following the established $L_X-T_X$ and $L_X-Y_X$

relations, especially for future blind stacking, can come from several factors,
including miscentering, projection, contamination of low mass systems, mass
bias and covariance bias. We also evaluate the fractions of relaxed and cool

we generalise the study to the case of a supermassive black hole binary
(SMBHB), using both analytical estimates and hydrodynamical simulations,
looking for specific observable signatures. The range of binary separation for
which it is possible to distinguish between the disruption created by a single
or a binary black hole concerns typically separations of order a few
milliparsecs for a primary of mass $\sim 10^6M_{\odot}$. When the fallback rate
is affected by the secondary, it undergoes two types interruptions, depending
on the initial inclination $\theta$ of the orbit of the star relative to the
plane of the SMBHB. For $\theta \lesssim 70^\circ$, periodic sharp
interruptions occur and the time of first interruption depends on the distance
of the secondary black hole with the debris. If $\theta \gtrsim 70^\circ$, a
first smooth interruption occurs, but not always followed by a further recovery
of the fallback rate. This implies that most of the TDEs around a SMBHB will
undergo periodic sharp interruptions of their lightcurve.

progressive disease, such as cancer or Alzheimer's. Progressive diseases often
start with mild symptoms that might precede a diagnosis, and each patient
follows their own trajectory. Patient trajectories exhibit wild variability,
which can be associated with many factors such as genotype, age, or sex. An
additional layer of complexity is that, in real life, the amount and type of
data available for each patient can differ significantly. For example, for one
patient we might have no prior history, whereas for another patient we might
have detailed clinical assessments obtained at multiple prior time-points. This
paper presents a probabilistic model that can handle multiple modalities
(including images and clinical assessments) and variable patient histories with
irregular timings and missing entries, to predict clinical scores at future
time-points. We use a sigmoidal function to model latent disease progression,
which gives rise to clinical observations in our generative model. We
implemented an approximate Bayesian inference strategy on the proposed model to
estimate the parameters on data from a large population of subjects.
Furthermore, the Bayesian framework enables the model to automatically
fine-tune its predictions based on historical observations that might be
available on the test subject. We applied our method to a longitudinal
Alzheimer's disease dataset with more than 3000 subjects [23] and present a
detailed empirical analysis of prediction performance under different
scenarios, with comparisons against several benchmarks. We also demonstrate how
the proposed model can be interrogated to glean insights about temporal
dynamics in Alzheimer's disease.

BioNetGen language (BNGL), which is used to formulate mathematical, rule-based
models of biochemical systems. BNGL provides an intuitive plain-text, or
string, representation of such systems, which is based on a graphical
formalism. Reactions are defined in terms of graph-rewriting rules that specify
the necessary intrinsic properties of the reactants, a transformation, and a
rate law. Rules may also contain contextual constraints that restrict
application of the rule. In some cases, the specification of contextual
constraints can be verbose, making a rule difficult to read. RuleBuilder is
designed to ease the task of reading and writing individual reaction rules, as
well as individual BNGL patterns similar to those found in rules. The software
assists in the reading of existing models by converting BNGL strings of
interest into a graph-based representation composed of nodes and edges.
RuleBuilder also enables the user to construct de novo a visual representation
of BNGL strings using drawing tools available in its interface. As objects are
added to the drawing canvas, the corresponding BNGL string is generated on the
fly, and objects are similarly drawn on the fly as BNGL strings are entered
into the application. RuleBuilder thus facilitates construction and
interpretation of rule-based models.

processes (ZiGP) for such zero-inflated datasets, produced by sparse kernels
through learning a latent probit Gaussian process that can zero out kernel rows
and columns whenever the signal is absent. The ZiGPs are particularly useful
for making the powerful Gaussian process networks more interpretable. We
introduce sparse GP networks where variable-order latent modelling is achieved

systems, such as tripping of a generating unit or a transmission line. Such
failures can propagate and destabilize the entire power system, potentially
leading to widespread outages. One approach to mitigate impending cascading
failures is through controlled islanding, in which a set of transmission lines
is deliberately tripped to partition the unstable system into several disjoint,
internally stable islands. Selecting such a set of transmission lines is
inherently a combinatorial optimization problem. Current approaches address
this problem in two steps: first classify coherent generators into groups and
then separate generator groups into different islands with minimal
load-generation imbalance. These methods, however, are based on computationally
expensive heuristics that do not provide optimality guarantees. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach to controlled islanding based on weak
submodularity. Our formulation jointly captures the minimal generator
non-coherency and minimal load-generation imbalance in one objective function.
We relax the problem to a formulation with bounded submodularity ratio and a
matroid constraint, and propose an approximation algorithm which achieves a
provable optimality bound on non-coherency and load-generation imbalance. The
proposed framework is tested on IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus power systems.

outstanding question is whether the inferred paleofields represent the
background magnetic field of the solar nebula or were unique to the
chondrule-forming environment. We investigate the amplification of the magnetic
field above background values for two proposed chondrule formation mechanisms,
large-scale nebular shocks and planetary bow shocks. Behind large-scale shocks,
the magnetic field parallel to the shock front is amplified by factors $\sim
10-30$, regardless of the magnetic diffusivity. Therefore, chondrules melted in
these shocks probably recorded an amplified magnetic field. Behind planetary
bow shocks, the field amplification is sensitive to the magnetic diffusivity.
We compute the gas properties behind a bow shock around a 3000 km-radius
planetary embryo, with and without atmospheres, using hydrodynamics models. We
calculate the ionization state of the hot, shocked gas, including thermionic
emission from dust, and thermal ionization of gas-phase potassium atoms, and
the magnetic diffusivity due to Ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion. We
find that the diffusivity is sufficiently large that magnetic fields have
already relaxed to background values in the shock downstream where chondrules
acquire magnetizations, and that these locations are sufficiently far from the
planetary embryos that chondrules should not have recorded a significant
putative dynamo field generated on these bodies. We conclude that, if melted in
planetary bow shocks, chondrules probably recorded the background nebular
field.

the K2 mission. The star is relatively nearby ($d$ = 69 pc) and bright ($V$ =
10.7 mag, $K_s$ = 8.4 mag), making the planetary system an attractive target
for radial velocity follow-up and atmospheric characterization with the James
Webb Space Telescope. The inner two planets are hot super-Earths ($R_b$ = 1.40
$\pm$ 0.06 R$_\oplus$, $R_c$ = 1.34 $\pm$ 0.08 R$_\oplus$), while the outer
planet is a warm sub-Neptune ($R_d$ = 2.6 $\pm$ 0.1 R$_\oplus$). We estimate
the stellar age to be 360$^{+490}_{-140}$ Myr based on rotation, activity, and
kinematic indicators. The K2-233 system is particularly interesting given
recent evidence for inflated radii in planets around similarly-aged stars, a
trend potentially related to photo-evaporation, core-cooling, or both
mechanisms.

Yet,
little is known of how specific properties of music impact speech processing.
This paper addresses this knowledge gap by investigating 1) whether the masking
effect of background music with lyrics is larger than that of music without
lyrics, and 2) whether the masking effect is larger for more complex music. To
answer these questions, a word identification experiment was run in which Dutch
participants listened to Dutch CVC words embedded in stretches of background
music in two conditions, with and without lyrics, and at three SNRs. Three
songs were used of different genres and complexities. Music stretches with and
without lyrics were sampled from the same song in order to control for factors
beyond the presence of lyrics. The results showed a clear negative impact of
the presence of lyrics in background music on spoken-word recognition. This
impact is independent of complexity. The results suggest that social spaces
(e.g., restaurants, caf\'es and bars) should make careful choices of music to
promote conversation, and open a path for future work.

developed. The theory allows one to calculate the threshold current for the

outperform state-of-the-art defect prediction algorithms defined by Ghortra et

perform much better than standard learners.

most well-known and widely used algorithms, due to its mathematical elegance

as it might be, state-of-the-art lacks an intuitive way to explain the ranking

paradigm shift for PageRank, from identifying which nodes are most important to
understanding why the ranking algorithm gives a particular ranking result. We
formally define the PageRank auditing problem, whose central idea is to
identify a set of key graph elements (e.g., edges, nodes, subgraphs) with the
highest influence on the ranking results. We formulate it as an optimization
problem and propose a family of effective and scalable algorithms (AURORA) to
solve it. Our algorithms measure the influence of graph elements and
incrementally select influential elements w.r.t. their gradients over the
ranking results. We perform extensive empirical evaluations on real-world
datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed methods (AURORA) provide
intuitive explanations with a linear scalability.

fixed- and random-parameter count data models are calibrated. The models

prediction accuracy. The results show that the statewide calibration factor is

variables: annual average daily traffic, segment length, shoulder width, lane

the energy-dependent evolutions of all correlated interaction parameters are
derived after taking into account one-loop corrections from the interplay

interaction and impurity influence the low-energy properties of two-dimensional
semi-Dirac materials are discreetly explored and addressed attentively. After
carrying out the standard renormalization group analysis, we find that both
trivial insulating and nontrivial semimetal states are qualitatively stable
against all four kinds of four-fermion interactions. However, while switching
on both four-fermion interaction and impurity, certain insulator-semimetal
phase transition and the distance of Dirac nodal points can be respectively
induced and modified due to their strong interplay and intimate competition.
Moreover, several non-Fermi liquid behaviors that deviate from the conventional
Fermi liquids are exhibited at the lowest-energy limit.

judged salient than others, and implies a relative rank exists on salient
objects. The solution presented in this paper solves this more general problem
that considers relative rank, and we propose data and metrics suitable to
measuring success in a relative object saliency landscape. A novel deep
learning solution is proposed based on a hierarchical representation of
relative saliency and stage-wise refinement. We also show that the problem of

it often fails to consider the additional information contained in the

from the intense stellar wind to the upper atmospheres of three of the
Trappist-1 planets (e, f, and g). We use a formalism that treats the system as
two electromagnetic regions, where the efficiency of the energy transmission
between one region (the stellar wind at the planetary orbits) to the other (the
planetary ionospheres) depends on the relation between the conductances and
impedances of the two regions. Since the energy flux of the stellar wind is
very high at these planetary orbits, we find that for the case of high
transmission efficiency (when the conductances and impedances are close in
magnitude), the energy dissipation in the upper planetary atmospheres is also
very large. On average, the Ohmic energy can reach $0.5-1~W/m^2$, about 1\% of
the stellar irradiance and 5-15 times the EUV irradiance. Here, using constant
values for the ionospheric conductance, we demonstrate that the stellar wind
energy could potentially drive large atmospheric heating in terrestrial
planets, as well as in hot jupiters. More detailed calculations are needed to
assess the ionospheric conductance and to determine more accurately the amount
of heating the stellar wind can drive in close-orbit planets.

noise is usable and when the channel has an intrinsic characteristic that a

as a tool that extrinsically makes Bob more advantageous than Eve. This method
uses error-correcting code in addition to the common key and noise, and manages
the three components in random-number transmission. Secret keys are generated
from noise, and messages are encrypted with the secret keys in a one-time pad
manner. As a result, information leaks meaningful to Eve are restricted to the
parity-check symbols for the random numbers. It is possible to derive the
candidates of the common key from the parity check symbols, and the security of
this method is quantified in terms of the amount of computations needed for an
exhaustive search of the candidates, where we evaluate the security by assuming
that all parity check symbols leak to Eve without bit errors. Noise contributes
to not only generating secret keys but also enhancing the security because the

items from a larger set of items based on a number of possibly-noisy tests, and
is relevant in applications such as medical testing, communication protocols,
pattern matching, and many more. One of the defining features of the group
testing problem is the distinction between the non-adaptive and adaptive
settings: In the non-adaptive case, all tests must be designed in advance,
whereas in the adaptive case, each test can be designed based on the previous
outcomes. While tight information-theoretic limits and near-optimal practical
algorithms are known for the adaptive setting in the absence of noise,
surprisingly little is known in the noisy adaptive setting. In this paper, we
address this gap by providing information-theoretic achievability and converse
bounds under various noise models, as well as a slightly weaker achievability
bound for a computationally efficient variant. These bounds are shown to be
tight or near-tight in a broad range of scaling regimes, particularly at low
noise levels. The algorithms used for the achievability results have the
notable feature of only using two or three stages of adaptivity.

learning model. Our algorithms are interactive in nature, i.e., instead of
outputting a model based on the training data, they provide predictions for a
set of $m$ feature vectors that arrive online. We show that, for the feature
vectors on which an ensemble of models (trained on random disjoint subsets of a
dataset) makes consistent predictions, there is almost no-cost of privacy in
generating accurate predictions for those feature vectors. To that end, we
provide a novel coupling of the distance to instability framework with the
sparse vector technique. We provide algorithms with formal privacy and utility
guarantees for both binary/multi-class classification, and soft-label
classification. For binary classification in the standard (agnostic) PAC model,
we show how to bootstrap from our privately generated predictions to construct
a computationally efficient private learner that outputs a final accurate
hypothesis. Our construction - to the best of our knowledge - is the first
computationally efficient construction for a label-private learner. We prove
sample complexity upper bounds for this setting. As in non-private sample
complexity bounds, the only relevant property of the given concept class is its
VC dimension. For soft-label classification, our techniques are based on
exploiting the stability properties of traditional learning algorithms, like
stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We provide a new technique to boost the
average-case stability properties of learning algorithms to strong (worst-case)
stability properties, and then exploit them to obtain private classification
algorithms. In the process, we also show that a large class of SGD methods
satisfy average-case stability properties, in contrast to a smaller class of

solar cell performance. Nevertheless, the characterization of the band tailing
in experimental semiconductor crystals is generally difficult. In this article,
to determine the tail state generation in various solar cell materials, we have
developed a quite general theoretical scheme in which the experimental Urbach
energy is compared with the absorption edge energy derived from density
functional theory (DFT) calculation. For this purpose, the absorption spectra
of solar cell materials, including CdTe, CuInSe2 (CISe), CuGaSe2 (CGSe),
Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and hybrid perovskites, have been
calculated by DFT particularly using very-high-density k meshes. As a result,
we find that the tail state formation is negligible in CdTe, CISe, CGSe and
hybrid perovskite polycrystals. However, coevaporated CZTSe and CZTS layers
exhibit very large Urbach energies, which are far larger than the theoretical
counterparts. Based on DFT analysis results, we conclude that the quite large
tail state formation observed in the CZTSe and CZTS originates from extensive
cation disordering. In particular, even a slight cation substitution is found
to generate unusual band fluctuation in CZT(S)Se. In contrast, CH3NH3PbI3
hybrid perovskite shows the sharpest absorption edge theoretically, which
agrees with experiment.

narrowly carried out on conventional rate-based spiking system designs for
fulfilling the practical cognitive tasks, underestimating SNN's energy
efficiency, throughput, and system flexibility. Although the time-based SNN can
be more attractive conceptually, its potentials are not unleashed in realistic

hardware-favorable techniques: precise single-spike temporal encoding,
efficient supervised temporal learning, and fast asymmetric decoding are
proposed accordingly to boost the energy efficiency and data processing

one-cycle pulse of a specifically polarized electric field, the charge
densities at half of the sites of the system oscillate in the same phase and

Fourier transform of the time profile of the charge density at any site after
photoexcitation has peaks for finite-sized systems that correspond to those of
the steady-state optical conductivity spectrum. For strong fields, these peaks
are suppressed and a new peak appears on the high-energy side, that is, the

oscillation is eventually damped. In the two-dimensional case without intersite

  Measurement",,,"10.1109/CCWC.2018.8301619",,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectrum sensing enables cognitive radio systems to detect unused portions of
the radio spectrum and then use them while avoiding interferences to the
primary users. Energy detection is one of the most used techniques for spectrum
sensing because it does not require any prior information about the
characteristics of the primary user signal. However, this technique does not
distinguish between the signal and the noise. It has a low performance at low
SNR, and the selection of the threshold becomes an issue because the noise is
uncertain. The detection performance of this technique can be further improved
using a dynamic selection of the sensing threshold. In this work, we
investigate a dynamic selection of this threshold by measuring the power of
noise present in the received signal using a blind technique. The proposed
model was implemented and tested using GNU Radio software and USRP units. Our
results show that the dynamic selection of the threshold based on measuring the
noise level present in the received signal during the detection process
increases the probability of detection and decreases the probability of false
alarm compared to the ones of energy detection with a static threshold.

can be used to obtain depth images of the retina. The changing layer
thicknesses can thus be quantified by analyzing these OCT images, moreover
these changes have been shown to correlate with disease progression in multiple
sclerosis. Recent automated retinal layer segmentation tools use machine
learning methods to perform pixel-wise labeling and graph methods to guarantee
the layer hierarchy or topology. However, graph parameters like distance and
smoothness constraints must be experimentally assigned by retinal region and
pathology, thus degrading the flexibility and time efficiency of the whole
framework. In this paper, we develop cascaded deep networks to provide a
topologically correct segmentation of the retinal layers in a single feed
forward propagation. The first network (S-Net) performs pixel-wise labeling and
the second regression network (R-Net) takes the topologically unconstrained
S-Net results and outputs layer thicknesses for each layer and each position.
Relu activation is used as the final operation of the R-Net which guarantees
non-negativity of the output layer thickness. Since the segmentation boundary
position is acquired by summing up the corresponding non-negative layer
thicknesses, the layer ordering (i.e., topology) of the reconstructed
boundaries is guaranteed even at the fovea where the distances between
boundaries can be zero. The R-Net is trained using simulated masks and thus can
be generalized to provide topology guaranteed segmentation for other layered
structures. This deep network has achieved comparable mean absolute boundary
error (2.82 {\mu}m) to state-of-the-art graph methods (2.83 {\mu}m).

The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the optimal

examples which contain human-imperceptible perturbations. A series of defending
methods, either proactive defence or reactive defence, have been proposed in
the recent years. However, most of the methods can only handle specific
attacks. For example, proactive defending methods are invalid against grey-box
or white-box attacks, while reactive defending methods are challenged by
low-distortion adversarial examples or transferring adversarial examples. This
becomes a critical problem since a defender usually does not have the type of
the attack as a priori knowledge. Moreover, existing two-pronged defences
(e.g., MagNet), which take advantages of both proactive and reactive methods,
have been reported as broken under transferring attacks. To address this
problem, this paper proposed a novel defensive framework based on collaborative
multi-task training, aiming at providing defence for different types of
attacks. The proposed defence first encodes training labels into label pairs
and counters black-box attacks leveraging adversarial training supervised by
the encoded label pairs. The defence further constructs a detector to identify
and reject high-confidence adversarial examples that bypass the black-box
defence. In addition, the proposed collaborative architecture can prevent
adversaries from finding valid adversarial examples when the defence strategy
is exposed. In the experiments, we evaluated our defence against four
state-of-the-art attacks on $MNIST$ and $CIFAR10$ datasets. The results showed
that our defending method achieved up to $96.3\%$ classification accuracy on
black-box adversarial examples, and detected up to $98.7\%$ of the high
confidence adversarial examples. It only decreased the model accuracy on benign
example classification by $2.1\%$ for the $CIFAR10$ dataset.

Its retrograde orbit points to an extragalactic origin, but no further chemical
evidence supports this idea. Light-element chemical abundances are useful to
tag GCs and can be used to shed light on this discussion. We aim to derive CN
and CH band strengths for red giant stars in NGC3201 and compare these with
photometric indices and high-resolution spectroscopy and discuss in the context
of GC chemical tagging. We found three groups in the CN-CH distribution. A main
sequence (S1), a secondary less-populated sequence (S2), and a group of
peculiar (pec) CN-weak and CH-weak stars, one of which was previously known.
The three groups seem to have different C+N+O and/or s-process element
abundances, to be confirmed by high-resolution spectroscopy. These are typical
characteristics of anomalous GCs. The CN distribution of NGC 3201 is
quadrimodal, which is more common in anomalous clusters. However, NGC3201 does
not belong to the trend of anomalous GCs in the mass-size relation. Three
scenarios are postulated here: (i) if the sequence pec-S1-S2 has increasing
C+N+O and s-process element abundances, NGC3201 would be the first anomalous GC
outside of the mass-size relation; (ii) if the abundances are almost constant,
NGC3201 would be the first non-anomalous GC with multiple CN-CH
anti-correlation groups; or (iii) it would be the first anomalous GC without
variations in C+N+O and s-process element abundances. In all cases, the
definition of anomalous clusters and the scenario in which they have an
extragalactic origin must be revised.

The phase field models have been widely used to study coarsening dynamics of
material systems with microstructures. It is known that phase field models are
usually derived from energy variation so that they obey some energy dissipation
laws intrinsically. Recently, many works have been published on investigating
fractional-order phase field models, but little is known of the corresponding
energy dissipation laws. We focus on the time-fractional phase field models and
report that the effective free energy and roughness obey a universal power-law
scaling dynamics during coarsening. Mainly, the effective free energy and
roughness in the time-fractional phase field models scale by following a
similar power law as the integer phase field models, where the power is
linearly proportional to the fractional order. This universal scaling law is
verified numerically against several phase field models, including the
Cahn-Hilliard equations with different variable mobilities and molecular beam
epitaxy models. This new finding sheds light on potential applications of time
fractional phase field models in studying coarsening dynamics and crystal
growths.

geometry of the expanding, large-scale Universe is very nearly Euclidean. This
basic empirical fact is at the core of the so-called ""flatness problem"", which
is widely perceived to be a major outstanding problem of modern cosmology and
as such forms one of the prime motivations behind inflationary models. An
inspection of the literature and some further critical reflection however
quickly reveals that the typical formulation of this putative problem is
fraught with questionable arguments and misconceptions and that it is moreover
imperative to distinguish between different varieties of problem. It is shown
that the observational fact that the large-scale Universe is so nearly flat is
ultimately no more puzzling than similar ""anthropic coincidences"", such as the
specific (orders of magnitude of the) values of the gravitational and
electromagnetic coupling constants. In particular, there is no fine-tuning
problem in connection to flatness of the kind usually argued for. The arguments
regarding flatness and particle horizons typically found in cosmological
discourses in fact address a mere $single$ issue underlying the standard FLRW
cosmologies, namely the $extreme$ improbability of these models with respect to
any ""reasonable measure"" on the ""space of all spacetimes"". This issue may be
expressed in different ways and a phase space formulation, due to Penrose, is
presented here. A horizon problem only arises when additional assumptions -
which are usually kept implicit and at any rate seem rather speculative - are
made.

inversion symmetry is absent, we show that superconducting states that avoid
mixing of spin-triplet and spin-singlet configurations are allowed, and
remarkably, spin-triplet states that are topologically nontrivial can be
stabilized in a large portion of the phase diagram. The orbital-dependent
spin-triplet pairing generally leads to topological superconductivity with
point nodes that are protected by a nonvanishing winding number. We demonstrate
that the disclosed topological phase can exhibit Lifshitz-type transitions upon
different driving mechanisms and interactions, e.g., by tuning the strength of
the atomic spin-orbit and inversion asymmetry couplings or by varying the
doping and the amplitude of order parameter. Such distinctive signatures of the
nodal phase manifest through an extraordinary reconstruction of the low-energy
excitation spectra both in the bulk and at the edge of the superconductor.

Construction of sentiment classifiers is a standard text mining task, but here
we address the question of how to properly evaluate them as there is no settled
way to do so. Sentiment classes are ordered and unbalanced, and Twitter
produces a stream of time-ordered data. The problem we address concerns the
procedures used to obtain reliable estimates of performance measures, and
whether the temporal ordering of the training and test data matters. We
collected a large set of 1.5 million tweets in 13 European languages. We
created 138 sentiment models and out-of-sample datasets, which are used as a
gold standard for evaluations. The corresponding 138 in-sample datasets are
used to empirically compare six different estimation procedures: three variants
of cross-validation, and three variants of sequential validation (where test
set always follows the training set). We find no significant difference between
the best cross-validation and sequential validation. However, we observe that
all cross-validation variants tend to overestimate the performance, while the
sequential methods tend to underestimate it. Standard cross-validation with
random selection of examples is significantly worse than the blocked
cross-validation, and should not be used to evaluate classifiers in
time-ordered data scenarios.

models. Manually crafting these features usually comes with high cost due to
the variety, volume and velocity of raw data in web-scale systems.
Factorization based models, which measure interactions in terms of vector
product, can learn patterns of combinatorial features automatically and
generalize to unseen features as well. With the great success of deep neural
networks (DNNs) in various fields, recently researchers have proposed several
DNN-based factorization model to learn both low- and high-order feature
interactions. Despite the powerful ability of learning an arbitrary function
from data, plain DNNs generate feature interactions implicitly and at the
bit-wise level. In this paper, we propose a novel Compressed Interaction
Network (CIN), which aims to generate feature interactions in an explicit
fashion and at the vector-wise level. We show that the CIN share some
functionalities with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural
networks (RNNs). We further combine a CIN and a classical DNN into one unified
model, and named this new model eXtreme Deep Factorization Machine (xDeepFM).
On one hand, the xDeepFM is able to learn certain bounded-degree feature
interactions explicitly; on the other hand, it can learn arbitrary low- and
high-order feature interactions implicitly. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on three real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that xDeepFM
outperforms state-of-the-art models. We have released the source code of

mechanics. It can represent, for example, a system with particles that have a
self-propulsion mechanism. Each node of the network specifies a possible
location of a particle, and its orientation. The orientation (which is formally
like a spin degree of freedom) determines the self-propulsion direction. The
bonds represent the possibility to make transitions: to hop between locations;
or to switch the orientation. In systems of experimental interest (Janus
particles), the self-propulsion is induced by illumination. An emergent aspect
is the topological stochastic disorder (TSD). It is implied by the
non-uniformity of the illumination. In technical terms the TSD reflects the
local non-zero circulations (affinities) of the stochastic transitions. This
type of disorder, unlike non-homogeneous magnetic field, is non-hermitian, and
can lead to the emergence of a complex relaxation spectrum. It is therefore
dramatically distinct from the conservative Anderson-type or Sinai-type
disorder. We discuss the consequences of having TSD. In particular we
illuminate 3~different routes to under-damped relaxation, and show that
localization plays a major role in the analysis. Implications of the bulk-edge

Atomic Force Microscopy (TUNA), which is able to detect ultra-low currents
ranging from 80 fA to 120 pA, was used to correlate the local topography with
electrical properties of tetraglycidyl methylene dianiline (TGMDA) epoxy
nanocomposites at low concentration of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) ranging from
0.05% up to 2% by wt. The results show the unique capability of TUNA technique
in identifying conductive pathways in CNF/resins even without modifying the
morphology with usual treatments employed to create electrical contacts to the

low-energy negative ion states of beryllium (configuration 2$s^2\varepsilon p\;
^2P$) and magnesium (configuration 3$s^2\varepsilon p\; ^2P$) atoms. The method
applies an additional perturbation potential and it requires only routine
bound-state multi-electron quantum calculations. Such computations are
accessible by most of the free or commercial quantum chemistry software
available for atoms and molecules. The perturbation potential is implemented as
a spherical Gaussian function with a fixed width. Stability of the analytic
continuation technique with respect to the width and with respect to the input
range of electron affinities is studied in detail. The computed resonance
parameters $E_r$=0.282 eV, $\Gamma$=0.316 eV for the $2p$ state of Be$^-$ and
$E_r$=0.188 eV, $\Gamma$=0.167 for the $3p$ state of Mg$^-$, agree well with
the best results obtained by much more elaborated and computationally demanding
present-day methods.

sensing of Earth's atmosphere, and the corresponding primary transit
spectroscopy has turned out to be valuable for characterization of extrasolar
planets. Our objective is an assessment of the detectability of molecular
signatures in Earth's transit spectra.
  To this end, we take a limb sequence of representative cloud-free
transmission spectra recorded by the space-borne ACE-FTS Earth observation
mission (Hughes et al., ACE infrared spectral atlases of the Earth's
atmosphere, JQSRT 2014) and combine these spectra to the effective height of
the atmosphere. These data are compared to spectra modeled with an atmospheric
radiative transfer line-by-line infrared code to study the impact of individual
molecules, spectral resolution, the choice of auxiliary data, and numerical
approximations. Moreover, the study serves as a validation of our infrared
radiative transfer code.
  The largest impact is due to water, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous
oxide, nitrogen, nitric acid, oxygen, and some chlorofluorocarbons (CFC11 and
CFC12). The effect of further molecules considered in the modeling is either
marginal or absent. The best matching model has a mean residuum of 0.4 km and a
maximum difference of 2 km to the measured effective height. For a quantitative
estimate of visibility and detectability we consider the maximum change of the
residual spectrum, the relative change of the residual norm, the additional
transit depth, and signal-to-noise ratios for a JWST setup. In conclusion, our
study provides a list of molecules that are relevant for modeling transmission
spectra of Earth-like exoplanets and discusses the feasibility of retrieval.

(ASD). Reviewed methodologies include: contemporary Computer Aided Systems

Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Assisted interventions. The research over the past
decade has provided enough demonstrations that individuals with ASD have a
strong interest in technology based interventions, which are useful in both,
clinical settings as well as at home and classrooms. Despite showing great
promise, research in developing an advanced technology based intervention that
is clinically quantitative for ASD is minimal. Moreover, the clinicians are
generally not convinced about the potential of the technology based
interventions due to non-empirical nature of published results. A major reason
behind this lack of acceptability is that a vast majority of studies on
distinct intervention methodologies do not follow any specific standard or
research design. We conclude from our findings that there remains a gap between
the research community of computer science, psychology and neuroscience to
develop an AI assisted intervention technology for individuals suffering from
ASD. Following the development of a standardized AI based intervention
technology, a database needs to be developed, to devise effective AI
algorithms.

to a molecular bound state. In the field of ultracold quantum gases, atomic
Feshbach resonances became a usual tool for tailoring atomic interactions
opening up many new applications in this field. In a semiconductor microcavity,
the Feshbach resonance appears when two lower polaritons are coupled to the
molecular biexciton state. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a cross
Feshbach resonance for which a pair of polaritons, lower together with upper,
effectively couples to the biexciton state. This demonstration is a crucial
step towards the efficient generation of entangled photon pairs in a
semiconductor microcavity. The existence of a Cross Feshbach resonance
establishes the condition to convert a pair of upper and lower polaritons via
the biexciton state into two lower polaritons, paving the way for the
generation of momentum and polarization entangled photons.

at high temperatures, become insulating below $\sim100$ K due to the formation
of a Charge Density Wave (CDW). The physics of this transition is not
conventional and involves a multiband Peierls instability with strong interband
coupling. This CDW ground state is readily destroyed with femtosecond laser
pulses resulting in a light-induced insulator-to-metal phase transition. The
current understanding of this transition remains incomplete, requiring
measurements of the transient electronic structure to complement previous
investigations of the lattice dynamics. Time- and angle-resolved
photo\-emission spectroscopy with extreme ultra-violet radiation is applied to
this end. We find that the transition from the insulating to the metallic band
structure occurs within $\sim660$ fs that is a fraction of the amplitude mode
period. The long life time of the transient state ($>100$ ps) is attributed to
trapping in a metastable state in accordance with previous work.

acceleration factors. Residual convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown
potential for removing artifacts caused by data undersampling. In this study we
investigated the effect of different radial sampling patterns on the accuracy
of a CNN. We also acquired actual real-time undersampled radial data in
patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), and compare CNN reconstruction to
Compressed Sensing (CS).
  METHODS: A 3D (2D plus time) CNN architecture was developed, and trained
using 2276 gold-standard paired 3D data sets, with 14x radial undersampling.
Four sampling schemes were tested, using 169 previously unseen 3D 'synthetic'
test data sets. Actual real-time tiny Golden Angle (tGA) radial SSFP data was
acquired in 10 new patients (122 3D data sets), and reconstructed using the 3D
CNN as well as a CS algorithm; GRASP.
  RESULTS: Sampling pattern was shown to be important for image quality, and
accurate visualisation of cardiac structures. For actual real-time data,
overall reconstruction time with CNN (including creation of aliased images) was
shown to be more than 5x faster than GRASP. Additionally, CNN image quality and
accuracy of biventricular volumes was observed to be superior to GRASP for the
same raw data.
  CONCLUSION: This paper has demonstrated the potential for the use of a 3D CNN
for deep de-aliasing of real-time radial data, within the clinical setting.
Clinical measures of ventricular volumes using real-time data with CNN
reconstruction are not statistically significantly different from the
gold-standard, cardiac gated, BH techniques.

quiescent prominence represented by a magnetic rope are investigated in terms
of the model proposed by Kolotkov et al. 2016. We consider a weakly nonlinear
case governed by a quadratic nonlinearity, and also analyse the fully nonlinear
equations of motion. We treat the prominence as a massive line current located
above the photosphere and interacting with the magnetised dipped environment
via the Lorentz force. In this concept the magnetic dip is produced by two
external current sources located at the photosphere. Finite amplitude
horizontal and vertical oscillations are found to be strongly coupled between
each other. The coupling is more efficient for larger amplitudes and smaller
attack angles between the direction of the driver and the horizontal axis.
Spatial structure of oscillations is represented by Lissajous-like curves with
the limit cycle of a hourglass shape, appearing in the resonant case, when the
frequency of the vertical mode is twice the horizontal mode frequency. A
metastable equilibrium of the prominence is revealed, which is stable for small
amplitude displacements, and becomes horizontally unstable, when the amplitude
exceeds a threshold value. The maximum oscillation amplitudes are also
analytically derived and analysed. Typical oscillation periods are determined
by the oscillation amplitude, prominence current, its mass and position above
the photosphere, and the parameters of the magnetic dip. The main new effects
of the finite amplitude are the coupling of the horizontally and vertically
polarised transverse oscillations (i.e. the lack of a simple, elliptically
polarised regime) and the presence of metastable equilibria of prominences.

number of units at the next level below that are strongly correlated. We use
Chow-Liu's algorithm to learn a tree-structured probabilistic model for the
units at the current level, use the tree to identify subsets of units that are
strongly correlated, and introduce a new unit with receptive field over the
subsets. The procedure is repeated on the new units to build multiple layers of
hidden units. The resulting model is called a TRF-net. Empirical results show
that, when compared to dense FNNs, TRF-net achieves better or comparable
classification performance with much fewer parameters and sparser structures.

Systems that are physically similar are expected to present smaller distances
(between their densities, wave functions and potentials) than systems that
present different physical behaviors. For this reason metric spaces are good
candidates for probing quantum phase transitions, since they could identify
regimes of distinct phases. Here we apply metric space analysis to explore the
transitions between the several phases in spin imbalanced systems. In
particular we investigate the so-called FFLO (Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov)
phase, which is an intriguing phenomenon in which superconductivity and
magnetism coexist in the same material. This is expected to appear for example
in attractive fermionic systems with spin-imbalanced populations, due to the
internal polarization produced by the imbalance. The transition between FFLO
phase (superconducting phase) and the normal phase (non-superconducting) and
their boundaries have been subject of discussion in recent years. We consider
the Hubbard model in the attractive regime for which Density Matrix
Renormalization Group calculations allow us to obtain the exact density
function of the system. We then analyze the exact density distances as a
function of the polarization. We find that our distances display signatures of
the distinct quantum phases in spin-imbalanced fermionic systems: with respect
to a central reference polarization, systems without FFLO present a very
symmetric behavior, while systems with phase transitions are asymmetric.

from binary interactions to the gravitational collapse of interstellar

bedrock on which to compare and interpret upcoming high-resolution data (e.g.
\emph{ALMA} data) using 3D models. We develop a simplified analytical
parametrised description of a 3D EDE, with a possible substructure such as
warps, gaps, and spiral instabilities. In addition, different velocity fields
(Keplerian, radial, super-Keplerian, sub-Keplerian and rigid rotation) are
considered. The effect of a bipolar outflow is also investigated. The
geometrical models are fed into the 3D radiative transfer code {\tt LIME}, that
produces 3D intensity maps throughout velocity space. We investigate the
spectral signature of the $J$=3$-$2 up to $J$=7$-$6 rotational transitions of
CO in the models, as well as the spatial aspect of this emission by means of
channel maps, wide-slit position-velocity (PV) diagrams, stereograms, and

electronic properties. Here we generalize the TSM state further to a
higher-symmetry and higher-dimensional pseudo Dirac nodal sphere (PDNS) state,
with the band crossings forming a 2D closed sphere at the Fermi level. The PDNS
state is characterized with a spherical backbone consisting of multiple

maintained by weak interactions. It exhibits some unique electronic properties

possible types of PDNS states, and identify all the possible band crossings
with pairs of 1D irreducible representations to form the PDNS states in 32
point groups. Importantly, we discover that strained MH3 (M= Y, Ho, Tb, Nd) and
Si3N2 are materials candidates to realize these two types of PDNS states,
respectively. As a high-symmetry-required state, the PDNS semimetal can be

First, we will establish a gap theorem which allows to deduce that a sequence
$(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of real numbers in $[0,1)$ having a certain weak gap
structure, cannot have Poissonian pair correlations. This result covers a broad
class of sequences, e.g., Kronecker sequences, the van der Corput sequence and
in more general $LS$-sequences of points and digital $(t,1)$-sequences.
Additionally, this theorem enables us to derive negative pair correlation
properties for sequences of the form $(\lbrace a_n \alpha \rbrace)_{n \in
\mathbb{N}}$, where $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a strictly increasing
sequence of integers with maximal order of additive energy, a notion that plays
an important role in many fields, e.g., additive combinatorics, and is strongly
connected to Poissonian pair correlation problems. These statements are not
only metrical results, but hold for all possible choices of $\alpha$.
  Second, in this note we study the pair correlation statistics for sequences
of the form, $x_n = \lbrace b^n \alpha \rbrace, \ n=1, 2, 3, \ldots$, with an
integer $b \geq 2$, where we choose $\alpha$ as the Stoneham number and as an
infinite de Bruijn word. We will prove that both instances fail to have the
Poissonian property. Throughout this article $\lbrace \cdot \rbrace$ denotes
the fractional part of a real number.

leading edge of the flare kernel showed the intensity enhancement in the blue
wing, and the smaller intensity of the blue-side peak (h2v) than that of the
red-side one (h2r). The blueshift lasted for 9-48 s with a typical speed of
10.1 $\pm$ 2.6 km s$^{-1}$ and it was followed by the high intensity and the
large redshift with a speed of up to 51 km s$^{-1}$ detected in the Mg II h
line. The large redshift was a common property for all six lines but the
blueshift prior to it was found only in the Mg II lines. A cloud modeling of
the Mg II h line suggests that the blue wing enhancement with such peak
difference can be caused by a chromospheric-temperature (cool) upflow. We
discuss a scenario in which an upflow of cool plasma is lifted up by expanding
hot plasma owing to the deep penetration of non-thermal electrons into the
chromosphere. Furthermore, we found that the blueshift persisted without any
subsequent redshift in the leading edge of the flare kernel during its decaying
phase. The cause of such long-lasting blueshift is also discussed.

light curves shows that the two anomalies are explained with two planetary mass
ratio companions to the primary lens. Although a binary source model is also
able to explain the second anomaly, it is marginally ruled out by 3.1 $\sigma$.
The 2-planet model indicates that the first anomaly was caused by planet ""b""
with a mass ratio of $q = (4.5_{-0.6}^{+0.7}) \times 10^{-4}$ and projected
separation in unit of the Einstein radius, $s = 0.753 \pm 0.004$. The second
anomaly reveals planet ""c"" with a mass ratio of $q_{2} = (7.0_{-1.7}^{+2.3})
\times 10^{-4}$ with $\Delta \chi^{2} \sim 170$ compared to the single planet
model. Its separation has a so-called close-wide degeneracy. We estimated the
physical parameters of the lens system from Bayesian analysis. This gives that
the masses of planet b and c are $m_{\rm b} = 56_{-33}^{+51}\,M_{\oplus}$ and
$m_{\rm c} = 85_{-51}^{+86}\,M_{\oplus}$, respectively, and they orbit a late
type star with a mass of $M_{\rm host} = 0.40_{-0.24}^{+0.36}\,M_{\odot}$
located at $D_{\rm L} = 6.4_{-1.8}^{+1.3}\,\rm kpc$ from us. If the 2-planet
model is true, this is the third multiple planet system detected by using the
microlensing method, and the first multiple planet system detected in the low
magnification events, which are dominant in the microlensing survey data. The
occurrence rate of multiple cold gas giant systems is estimated using the two
such detections and a simple extrapolation of the survey sensitivity of 6 year
MOA microlensing survey (Suzuki et al. 2016) combined with the 4 year $\mu$FUN
detection efficiency (Gould et al. 2010). It is estimated that $6 \pm 2\,\%$ of

external field that couples to local {\em non-affine} displacements, i.e. those
displacements of neighbouring vertices that cannot be represented as a local
affine strain. We obtain both zero and finite temperature phase diagrams in the
strain -- field plane. Pleats occur here as a result of an equilibrium
first-order transition from the homogeneous network to a heterogeneous phase
where stress is localised within pleats and eliminated elsewhere. We show that
in the thermodynamic limit the un-pleated state is always metastable at
vanishing field for infinitesimal strain. Plastic deformation of the initially
homogeneous network is akin to the decay of a metastable phase via a dynamical
transition. We make predictions concerning local stress distributions and
thermal effects associated with pleats which may be observable in suitable
experimental systems.

dimension of a quantum system in a prepare-and-measure scenario imposing
minimal assumptions on the internal features of the devices. However, as the
dimension increases, the major obstacle in the realization of DW arises due to
the requirement of many outcome quantum measurements. In this article, we
propose a new variant of a widely studied communication task (random access
code) and take its average payoff as the DW. The presented DW applies to
arbitrarily large quantum systems employing only binary outcome measurements.

considered as functions values in $\mathbb{R}^r$, but as consecutive

Previously, we have proved that a property called spectral condition or sum
rule implies a factorization in terms of a generalized difference operator that
gives rise to a ""difference scheme"" whose contractivity governs the convergence
of the scheme. But many convergent Hermite schemes, for example, those based on
cardinal splines, do not satisfy the spectral condition. In this paper, we

game model whose behavior mimics an empirically derived non-local homogeneous
flocking model for agents with gradient self-propulsion dynamics. The
mean-field game framework provides a non-cooperative optimal control
description of the behavior of a population of agents in a distributed setting.
In this description, each agent's state is driven by optimally controlled
dynamics that result in a Nash equilibrium between itself and the population.
The optimal control is computed by minimizing a cost that depends only on its
own state, and a mean-field term. The agent distribution in phase space evolves
under the optimal feedback control policy. We exploit the low-rank perturbative
nature of the non-local term in the forward-backward system of equations
governing the state and control distributions, and provide a linear stability
analysis demonstrating that our model exhibits bifurcations similar to those

severe consequences may result. For probabilistic image registration (PIR), the
predominant way to quantify the registration uncertainty is using summary

Does utilizing the registration uncertainty always be beneficial. We show that
there are two types of uncertainties: the transformation uncertainty, Ut, and

is a fundamental capability needed by machine systems to follow complex
directives. Recently, modular networks have been shown to be an effective
framework for performing visual reasoning tasks. While modular networks were
initially designed with a degree of model transparency, their performance on
complex visual reasoning benchmarks was lacking. Current state-of-the-art
approaches do not provide an effective mechanism for understanding the
reasoning process. In this paper, we close the performance gap between
interpretable models and state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods. We propose
a set of visual-reasoning primitives which, when composed, manifest as a model
capable of performing complex reasoning tasks in an explicitly-interpretable
manner. The fidelity and interpretability of the primitives' outputs enable an
unparalleled ability to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of the resulting
model. Critically, we show that these primitives are highly performant,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.1% on the CLEVR dataset. We also show
that our model is able to effectively learn generalized representations when
provided a small amount of data containing novel object attributes. Using the
CoGenT generalization task, we show more than a 20 percentage point improvement
over the current state of the art.

Towards this goal, we present a practical evaluation algorithm that allows
constant delay enumeration of a spanner's output after a precomputation phase

interfaces, and in hydrophobic confinement inform the hydration of hydrophobic
solutes as well as their interactions and assembly. The characterization of
such free energetics is typically performed using enhanced sampling techniques
such as umbrella sampling. In umbrella sampling, order parameter distributions
obtained from adjacent biased simulations must overlap in order to estimate
free energy differences between biased ensembles. Many biased simulations are
typically required to ensure such overlap, which exacts a steep computational
cost. We recently introduced a sparse sampling method, which circumvents the
overlap requirement by using thermodynamic integration to estimate free energy
differences between biased ensembles. Here we build upon and generalize sparse
sampling for characterizing the free energetics of water density fluctuations
in systems near liquid-vapor coexistence. We also introduce sensible heuristics
for choosing the biasing potential parameters and strategies for adaptively
refining them, which facilitate the estimation of such free energetics
accurately and efficiently. We illustrate the method by characterizing the free
energetics of cavitation in a large volume in bulk water. We also use sparse
sampling to characterize the free energetics of capillary evaporation for water
confined between two hydrophobic plates. In both cases, sparse sampling is
nearly two orders of magnitude faster than umbrella sampling. Given its
efficiency, the sparse sampling method is particularly well suited for
characterizing free energy landscapes for systems wherein umbrella sampling is
prohibitively expensive.

where $\bar{\bf u}{\scriptstyle(t,{\bf x})}$ is the ensemble-averaged velocity
field, $\mu_\alpha$ is an enhanced molecular viscosity, and $C_\alpha$ is a
turbulent mixing coefficient (with units (length)$^\alpha$/(time)). The
derivation is grounded in Boltzmann kinetic theory, which presumes an
equilibrium probability distribution $f_\alpha^{eq}(t,{\bf x},{\bf u})$ of
particle speeds. While historically $f_\alpha^{eq}$ has been assumed to be the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, we show that any member of the family of L\'evy
$\alpha$-stable distributions is a suitable alternative. If $\alpha=2$, then
$f^{eq}_\alpha$ is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, with large particle
speeds very unlikely, and the Navier-Stokes equations are recovered (with
$\mu_\alpha = \mu$ and $C_\alpha = 0$). If $0 < \alpha < 2$, then
$f^{eq}_\alpha$ is a L\'evy $\alpha$-stable distribution, with ""heavy tails""
that permit large velocity fluctuations, as in turbulence. For shear turbulent
flows, the choice of $\alpha = 1$ (Cauchy distribution for $f_\alpha^{eq}$)
leads to the logarithmic velocity profile known as the Law of the Wall. We also

class label function varies smoothly on the data graph, resulting in the rather
strict prior that the label function has low-frequency content. Meanwhile, in
many classification problems, the label function may vary abruptly in certain
graph regions, resulting in high-frequency components. Although the
semi-supervised estimation of class labels is an ill-posed problem in general,
in several applications it is possible to find a source graph on which the
label function has similar frequency content to that on the target graph where
the actual classification problem is defined. In this paper, we propose a
method for domain adaptation on graphs motivated by these observations. Our
algorithm is based on learning the spectrum of the label function in a source
graph with many labeled nodes, and transferring the information of the spectrum
to the target graph with fewer labeled nodes. While the frequency content of
the class label function can be identified through the graph Fourier transform,
it is not easy to transfer the Fourier coefficients directly between the two
graphs, since no one-to-one match exists between the Fourier basis vectors of
independently constructed graphs in the domain adaptation setting. We solve
this problem by learning a transformation between the Fourier bases of the two
graphs that flexibly ``aligns'' them. The unknown class label function on the
target graph is then reconstructed such that its spectrum matches that on the
source graph while also ensuring the consistency with the available labels. The
proposed method is tested in the classification of image, online product
review, and social network data sets. Comparative experiments suggest that the
proposed algorithm performs better than recent domain adaptation methods in the
literature in most settings.

rise to topologically protected edge states. The proposal is based on the
combination of dipolar exchange interaction, which couples the internal angular
momentum and the orbital degree of freedom of a Rydberg excitation, and a
static magnetic field breaking time reversal symmetry. We demonstrate that for
realistic experimental parameters, signatures of topologically protected edge
states are present in small systems with as few as 10 atoms. Our analysis paves
the way for the experimental realization of Rydberg systems characterized by a
topological invariant, providing a promising setup for future application in
quantum information.

to lithic-rich proximal deposits from a stratigraphic section of the Cretaio
Tephra eruption (Ischia Island, Italy). Analyses were performed separately on
bulk material, juvenile, and lithic fraction from each pyroclastic layer.
Results highlight that the bulk material is characterized by a single scaling
regime whereas two scaling regimes, with contrasting power-law exponents, are
observed for the juvenile and the lithic fractions. On the basis of these
results, we infer that the bulk material cannot be considered as a good proxy
for deducing eruption dynamics because it is the result of mixing of fragments
belonging to the lithic and juvenile fraction, both of which underwent
different events of fragmentation governed by different mechanisms. In
addition, results from fractal analyses of the lithic fraction suggest that it
likely experienced a fragmentation eventin which the efficiency of
fragmentation was larger for the coarser fragments relative to the finer ones.
On the contrary, we interpret the different scaling regimes observed for the
juvenile fraction as due to sequential events of fragmentation in the conduit,
possibly enhanced by the presence of lithic fragments in the eruptive mixture.
In particular, collisional events generated increasing amounts of finer
particles modifying the original juvenile GSDs and determining the development
of two scaling regimes in which the finer fragments record a higher efficiency
of fragmentation relative to the coarser ones. We further suggest that in
lithic-rich proximal fall deposits possible indications about the original GSDs
of the juvenile fraction might still reside in the coarser particles fraction.

stellar objects, we observed the well-known core G31.41+0.31 with ALMA at 1.4
mm with an angular resolution of~0.22"" (~1700 au). The dust continuum emission
has been resolved into two cores namely Main and NE. The Main core, which has
the stronger emission and is the more chemically rich, has a diameter of ~5300
au, and is associated with two free-free continuum sources. The Main core looks
featureless and homogeneous in dust continuum emission and does not present any
hint of fragmentation. Each transition of CH3CN and CH3OCHO, both ground and
vibrationally excited, as well as those of CH3CN isotopologues, shows a clear
velocity gradient along the NE-SW direction, with velocity linearly increasing
with distance from the center, consistent with solid-body rotation. However,
when comparing the velocity field of transitions with different upper level
energies, the rotation velocity increases with increasing energy of the
transition, which suggests that the rotation speeds up towards the center.
Spectral lines towards the dust continuum peak show an inverse P-Cygni profile
that supports the existence of infall in the core. The infall velocity
increases with the energy of the transition suggesting that the infall is
accelerating towards the center of the core, consistent with gravitational
collapse. Despite the monolithic appearance of the Main core, the presence of
red-shifted absorption, the existence of two embedded free-free sources at the
center, and the rotational spin-up are consistent with an unstable core
undergoing fragmentation with infall and differential rotation due to
conservation of angular momentum. Therefore, the most likely explanation for
the monolithic morphology is that the large opacity of the dust emission
prevents the detection of any inhomogeneity in the core.

structure involving two or three planets, as well as indicating possible
migration routes from secular to double resonances or pure 3-planet
commensurabilities. These structures are then compared to the present-day
orbital architecture of observed resonant chains. In a second part of the paper
we describe N-body simulations of type-I migration. Depending on the orbital
decay timescale, we show that 3-planet systems may be trapped in different
combinations of independent commensurabilities: (i) double resonances, (ii)
intersection between a 2-planet and a first-order 3-planet resonance, and (iii)
simultaneous libration in two first-order 3-planet resonances. These latter
outcomes are found for slow migrations, while double resonances are almost
always the final outcome in high-density disks. Finally, we discuss an
application to the TRAPPIST-1 system. We find that, for low migration rates and
planetary masses of the order of the estimated values, most 3-planet
sub-systems are able to reach the observed double resonances after following
evolutionary routes defined by pure 3-planet resonances. The final orbital
configuration shows resonance offsets comparable with present-day values
without the need of tidal dissipation. For the 8/5 resonance proposed to
dominate the dynamics of the two inner planets, we find little evidence of its
dynamical significance; instead, we propose that this relation between mean
motions could be a consequence of the interaction between a pure 3-planet
resonance and a 2-planet commensurability between planets c and d.

the shape of the viscous drift, replacing the usual linear viscous damping, and
its relation with the diffusion coefficient modulating the white noise term. As
a second step, we implement a procedure to reconstruct the drift and the
diffusion term of the LE from the time-series of the momentum of a heavy
particle embedded in a large Hamiltonian system. The results of our
reconstruction are in good agreement with the phenomenological arguments.
Applying the method to systems with negative temperature, we can observe that
also in this case there is a suitable Langevin equation, obtained with a
precise protocol, able to reproduce in a proper way the statistical features of
the slow variables. In other words, even in this context, systems with negative

exoplanet atmospheres and brightness variation across the stellar disk from
transit observations. The new method is capable of recovering exoplanet
atmosphere absorption spectra and stellar specific intensities without relying
on theoretical models of stars and planets. We fit both stellar specific
intensity and planetary radius simultaneously directly to transit light curves.
This allows stellar models to be removed from the data analysis. Furthermore,
we use a data-quality weighted filtering technique to achieve an optimal
trade-off between spectral resolution and reconstruction fidelity homogenising
the signal to noise ratio across the wavelength range. Such approach is more
efficient than conventional data binning onto a low resolution wavelength grid.
We demonstrate that our analysis is capable of re-producing results achieved by
using explicit quadratic limb darkening equation, and that the filtering
technique helps eliminating spurious spectral features in regions with strong
telluric absorption. The method is applied to the VLT FORS2 observations of the
exoplanets GJ 1214 b and WASP-49 b, and our results are in agreement with
previous studies. Comparisons between obtained stellar specific intensity and
numerical models indicates that the method is capable of accurately
reconstructing the specific intensity. The proposed method enables more robust
characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres by separating derivation of
planetary transmission and stellar specific intensity spectra (that is
model-independent) from chemical and physical interpretation.

Actually, Wikipedia offers solid knowledge and strong correlations among
countries by linking web pages together for different types of information
(e.g. economical, historical, political, and many others). The major finding of
this paper is to show that meaningful results on the influence of country ties
can be extracted from the hyperlinked structure of Wikipedia. We leverage a
novel stochastic matrix representation of Markov chains of complex directed
networks called the reduced Google matrix theory. For a selected small size set
of nodes, the reduced Google matrix concentrates direct and indirect links of
the million-node sized Wikipedia network into a small Perron-Frobenius matrix
keeping the PageRank probabilities of the global Wikipedia network. We perform
a novel sensitivity analysis that leverages this reduced Google matrix to
characterize the influence of relationships between countries from the global
network. We apply this analysis to two chosen sets of countries (i.e. the set
of 27 European Union countries and a set of 40 top worldwide countries). We
show that with our sensitivity analysis we can exhibit easily very meaningful
information on geopolitics from five different Wikipedia editions (English,

data sets were divided into three parts: training set (105 data), validation
set (20) and testing set (20). ANN and DNN were compared for the prediction of
the disintegrating time. The accuracy of the ANN model has reached 85.60%,
80.00% and 75.00% on the training set, validation set and testing set
respectively, whereas that of the DNN model was 85.60%, 85.00% and 80.00%,
respectively. Compared with the ANN, DNN showed the better prediction for ODT
formulations. It is the first time that deep neural network with the improved

The proposed predictive approach could evaluate the critical parameters about

the environment and the agent of more than $90\% $ with less than $30$

predicts a universal value for the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy
density, $\eta/s=1/4\pi$. The holographic calculations have motivated the
formulation of the celebrated KSS conjecture, according to which all fluids
conform to the lower bound $\eta/s \geq 1/4\pi$. The bound on $\eta/s$ may be
regarded as a lower bound on the {\it relaxation} properties of perturbed
fluids and it has been the focus of much recent attention. In particular, it
was argued that for a class of field theories with Gauss-Bonnet gravity dual,
the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$, could violate the
conjectured KSS bound. In the present paper we argue that the proposed
violations of the KSS bound are strongly constrained by Bekenstein's
generalized second law (GSL) of thermodynamics. In particular, it is shown that
physical consistency of the Gauss-Bonnet theory with the GSL requires its
coupling constant to be bounded by $\lambda_{GB}\lesssim 0.063$. We further
argue that the genuine physical bound on the relaxation properties of
physically consistent fluids is $\Im\omega(k>2\pi T)>\pi T$, where $\omega$ and
$k$ are respectively the proper frequency and the wavenumber of a perturbation
mode in the fluid.

by these facts, we aim to provide a set of software implementation guidelines,
i.e., MedShare to deal with interoperability issues among disconnected
healthcare systems. The proposed integrated architecture includes: 1) a data
extractor to fetch legacy medical data from a hemodialysis center, 2)
converting it to a common data model, 3) indexing patient information using the
HashMap technique, and 4) a set of services and tools that can be installed as
a coherent environment on top of stand-alone EHRs systems. Our work enabled
three cooperating but autonomous hospitals to mutually exchange medical data
and helped them develop a common reference architecture. It lets stakeholders
retain control over their patient data, winning the trust and confidence much
needed towards a successful deployment of MedShare. Security concerns were
effectively addressed that also included patient consent in the data exchange

previously identified a series of large-scale arch-like structures that have
never been seen before in any other debris disk and that move outward at high
velocities. We initiated a monitoring program with the following objectives: 1)
track the location of the structures and better constrain their projected
speeds, 2) search for new features emerging closer in, and ultimately 3)
understand the mechanism responsible for the motion and production of the disk
features. AU Mic was observed at 11 different epochs between August 2014 and
October 2017 with the IR camera and spectrograph of SPHERE. These high-contrast
imaging data were processed with a variety of angular, spectral, and
polarimetric differential imaging techniques to reveal the faintest structures
in the disk. We measured the projected separations of the features in a
systematic way for all epochs. We also applied the very same measurements to
older observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with the visible
cameras STIS and ACS. The main outcomes of this work are 1) the recovery of the
five southeastern broad arch-like structures we identified in our first study,
and confirmation of their fast motion (projected speed in the range 4-12 km/s);
2) the confirmation that the very first structures observed in 2004 with ACS
are indeed connected to those observed later with STIS and now SPHERE; 3) the
discovery of two new very compact structures at the northwest side of the disk

calculating scattering amplitudes that bypass the traditional construction
based on Lagrangians and Feynman rules. Motivated by this progress, we
investigate the long-wavelength behavior of scattering amplitudes of massless
scalar particles: Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons. The low-energy dynamics of NG
bosons is governed by the underlying spontaneously broken symmetry, which
likewise allows one to bypass the Lagrangian and connect the scaling of the
scattering amplitudes directly to the Lie algebra of the symmetry generators.
We focus on theories with enhanced soft limits, where the scattering amplitudes
scale with a higher power of momentum than expected based on the mere existence
of Adler's zero. Our approach is complementary to that developed recently by
Cheung et al., and in the first step we reproduce their result. That is, as far
as Lorentz-invariant theories with a single physical NG boson are concerned, we
find no other nontrivial theories featuring enhanced soft limits beyond the
already well-known ones: the Galileon and the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar.
Next, we show that in a certain sense, these theories do not admit a nontrivial
generalization to non-Abelian internal symmetries. Namely, for compact internal
symmetry groups, all NG bosons featuring enhanced soft limits necessarily
belong to the center of the group. For noncompact symmetry groups such as the
ISO($n$) group featured by some multi-Galileon theories, these NG bosons then
necessarily belong to an Abelian normal subgroup. The Lie-algebraic consistency
constraints admit two infinite classes of solutions, generalizing the known
multi-Galileon and multi-flavor DBI theories.

assigned to multiple communication requests. Each request contributes its
weight to the resources it uses and the total load on a resource is then
translated to the cost it incurs via a resource specific cost function. For
example, a request may be to establish a virtual circuit, thus contributing to
the load on each edge in the circuit. Motivated by energy efficiency
applications, recently, there is a growing interest in GND using cost functions
that exhibit (dis)economies of scale ((D)oS), namely, cost functions that
appear subadditive for small loads and superadditive for larger loads.
  The current paper advances the existing literature on approximation
algorithms for GND problems with (D)oS cost functions in various aspects: (1)
we present a generic approximation framework that yields approximation results
for a much wider family of requests in both directed and undirected graphs; (2)
our framework allows for unrelated weights, thus providing the first
non-trivial approximation for the problem of scheduling unrelated parallel
machines with (D)oS cost functions; (3) our framework is fully combinatorial
and runs in strongly polynomial time; (4) the family of (D)oS cost functions
considered in the current paper is more general than the one considered in the
existing literature, providing a more accurate abstraction for practical energy
conservation scenarios; and (5) we obtain the first approximation ratio for GND
with (D)oS cost functions that depends only on the parameters of the resources'
technology and does not grow with the number of resources, the number of
requests, or their weights. The design of our framework relies heavily on
Roughgarden's smoothness toolbox (JACM 2015), thus demonstrating the possible
usefulness of this toolbox in the area of approximation algorithms.

that the potential faults of software are hard to be discovered in the early

could be a supplement to enhance the UML. In this paper, we show how to

it is robust under insertion, therefore, enabling its use in incremental
constructions. The time-complexity analysis of the resulting simple randomized
incremental construction is non-standard, and interesting in its own right,
because the intermediate Voronoi-like structures are order-dependent. We
further extend the approach to compute the following structures in expected
linear time: the order-(k+1) subdivision within an order-k Voronoi region, and
the farthest abstract Voronoi diagram after the order of its regions at
infinity is known.

resurfacing of their regolith due to seismic shaking. In this work we present
the best pre-encounter near-infrared spectra of Apophis obtained so far. These
new data were obtained during the 2013 apparition using the NASA Infrared

previous observations by Binzel et al. (2009) but with a much higher
signal-to-noise ratio. Spectral band parameters were extracted from the spectra
and were used to determine the composition of the asteroid. Using a naive Bayes
classifier, we computed the likelihood of Apophis being an LL chondrite to be
>99% based on mol% of Fa vs. Fs. Using the same method, we estimated a
probability of 89% for Apophis being an LL chondrite based on ol/(ol+px) and

synergistically characterize a coherent cellular state. The first approaches
started from metabolic models which were extended by the regulation of the

representation of the integrated system as three network domains (regulatory,

systems. They lead to the definition of the entropy, which, for a homogeneous
system, is a homogeneous function of order one in the extensive variables and
is maximized at equilibrium. We say that the macroscopic systems are extensive
and so it is also the entropy. For a mesoscopic system, by definition, the size
and the contacts with other systems influence its thermodynamic properties and
therefore, if we define an entropy, this cannot be a homogeneous of order one
function in the extensive variables. So, mesoscopic systems and their entropies
are non-extensive. While for macroscopic systems and homogeneous entropies the
equilibrium conditions are clearly defined, it is not so clear how the
non-extensive entropies should be applied for the calculation of equilibrium
properties of mesoscopic systems--for example it is not clear what is the role
played by the boundaries and the contacts between the subsystems. We propose
here a general definition of the entropy in the equilibrium state, which is
applicable to both, macroscopic and mesoscopic systems. This definition still
leaves an apparent ambiguity in the definition of the entropy of a mesoscopic
system, but this we recognize as the signature of the anthropomorphic character
of the entropy (see Jaynes, Am. J. Phys. 33, 391, 1965).
  To exemplify our approach, we analyze four formulas for the entropy (two for
extensive and two for non-extensive entropies) and calculate the equilibrium
(canonical) distribution of probabilities by two methods for each. We show that
these methods, although widely used, are not equivalent and one of them is a
consequence of our definition of the entropy of a compound system.

two categories: one is the unscheduled train, whose operating frequency
fluctuates with origin-destination (OD) demands; the other is the scheduled
train, which is running based on regular timetable just like the passenger
trains. The timetable will be released to the public if determined and it would
not be influenced by OD demands. Typically, the total capacity of scheduled
trains can usually satisfy the predicted demands of express cargos in average.
However, the demands are changing in practice. Therefore, how to distribute the
shipments between different stations to unscheduled and scheduled train
services has become an important research field in railway transportation. This
paper focuses on the coordinated optimization of the rail express cargos
distribution in two service networks. On the premise of fully utilizing the
capacity of scheduled service network first, we established a Car-to-Train
(CTT) assignment model to assign rail express cargos to scheduled and
unscheduled trains scientifically. The objective function is to maximize the
net income of transporting the rail express cargos. The constraints include the
capacity restriction on the service arcs, flow balance constraints, logical
relationship constraint between two groups of decision variables and the due
date constraint. The last constraint is to ensure that the total transportation
time of a shipment would not be longer than its predefined due date. Finally,
we discuss the linearization techniques to simplify the model proposed in this
paper, which make it possible for obtaining global optimal solution by using
the commercial software.

couplings of the heavy Higgs boson to a pair of top quarks, through the decay
$H \to t\bar t \to b W^+ \bar b W^-$. We use the helicity-amplitude method to

one-dimensional angular distributions can only reveal two of them.

rely on directly tuning parameters like compression rate, to blindly reduce
image features, thereby lacking guarantee on both defense efficiency (i.e.
accuracy of polluted images) and classification accuracy of benign images,
after applying defense methods. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
JPEG-based defensive compression framework, namely ""feature distillation"", to
effectively rectify adversarial examples without impacting classification
accuracy on benign data. Our framework significantly escalates the defense
efficiency with marginal accuracy reduction using a two-step method: First, we
maximize malicious features filtering of adversarial input perturbations by
developing defensive quantization in frequency domain of JPEG compression or
decompression, guided by a semi-analytical method; Second, we suppress the
distortions of benign features to restore classification accuracy through a
DNN-oriented quantization refine process. Our experimental results show that
proposed ""feature distillation"" can significantly surpass the latest
input-transformation based mitigations such as Quilting and TV Minimization in
three aspects, including defense efficiency (improve classification accuracy
from $\sim20\%$ to $\sim90\%$ on adversarial examples), accuracy of benign
images after defense ($\le1\%$ accuracy degradation), and processing time per
image ($\sim259\times$ Speedup). Moreover, our solution can also provide the
best defense efficiency ($\sim60\%$ accuracy) against the recent adaptive
attack with least accuracy reduction ($\sim1\%$) on benign images when compared
with other input-transformation based defense methods.

the energy conditions and the nature of bulk geometry have been examined. It is
found that the expansion of the four-dimensional universe depends on its
location along the extra dimension and will be different at different locations
in the bulk spacetime. At low energies, the trapping of fields within the brane
implies a specific correlation between the warp factor and the

high energies, the bulk is assumed to be sourced by a scalar field with

momentum space the reaction amplitude factorizes into a product of projectile
and target transition form factors, folded with the nucleon-nucleon isovector
interaction and a distortion coefficient which accounts for initial and final
state ion-ion elastic interactions. The multipole structure of the transition
form factors is studied in detail for Fermi-type non-spin flip and
Gamow-Teller-type spin flip transitions, also serving to establish the
connection to nuclear beta decay. The reaction kernel is evaluated for central
and rank-2 tensor interactions. Initial and final state elastic ion-ion
interaction are shown to be dominated by the imaginary part of the optical
potential allowing to evaluate the reaction coefficients in the strong
absorption limit, realized by the black disk approximation. In that limit the
distortion coefficient is evaluated in closed form, revealing the relation to
the total reaction cross section and the geometry of the transition form
factors. It is shown that at small momentum transfer distortion effects reduce
to a simple scaling factor, allowing to define reduced forward-angle cross
section which is given by nuclear matrix elements of beta decay-type. The
response function formalism is used to describe nuclear charge changing
transitions. Spectral distributions obtained by a self-consistent HFB and QRPA

recognition systems by increasing the model size of Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks. Unfortunately, the ever-increasing size of LSTM model leads to
inefficient designs on FPGAs due to the limited on-chip resources. The previous
work proposes to use a pruning based compression technique to reduce the model
size and thus speedups the inference on FPGAs. However, the random nature of
the pruning technique transforms the dense matrices of the model to highly
unstructured sparse ones, which leads to unbalanced computation and irregular
memory accesses and thus hurts the overall performance and energy efficiency.
  In contrast, we propose to use a structured compression technique which could
not only reduce the LSTM model size but also eliminate the irregularities of
computation and memory accesses. This approach employs block-circulant instead
of sparse matrices to compress weight matrices and reduces the storage
requirement from $\mathcal{O}(k^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(k)$. Fast Fourier Transform
algorithm is utilized to further accelerate the inference by reducing the
computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(k^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(k\text{log}k)$. The datapath and activation functions are
quantized as 16-bit to improve the resource utilization. More importantly, we
propose a comprehensive framework called C-LSTM to automatically optimize and
implement a wide range of LSTM variants on FPGAs. According to the experimental
results, C-LSTM achieves up to 18.8X and 33.5X gains for performance and energy
efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art LSTM implementation under the

and/or vote for other countries' tunes. Throughout the years, the voting system
has repeatedly been accused of being biased by the presence of tactical voting,
according to which votes would represent strategic interests rather than actual
musical preferences of the voting countries. In this work, we develop a latent
space model to investigate the presence of a latent structure underlying the
exchange of votes. Focusing on the period from 1998 to 2015, we represent the
vote exchange as a multivariate network: each edition is a network, where
countries are the nodes and two countries are linked by an edge if one voted
for the other. The different networks are taken to be independent replicates of
a common latent space capturing the overall relationships among the countries.
Proximity denotes similarity, and countries close in the latent space are
assumed to be more likely to exchange votes. Therefore, if the exchange of
votes depends on the similarity between countries, the quality of the competing
songs might not be a relevant factor in the determination of the voting
preferences, and this would suggest the presence of bias. A Bayesian
hierarchical modelling approach is employed to model the probability of a
connection between any two countries as a function of their distance in the
latent space, and of network-specific parameters and edge-specific covariates.
The inferred latent space is found to be relevant in the determination of edge
probabilities, however, the positions of the countries in such space only
partially correspond to their actual geographical positions.

rigid rotating dipoles. The underlying high--dimensional potential energy
landscape is analyzed in particular by determining the equilibrium points and
their stability in the common plane of rotation. Starting from the minimal
energy configuration, the response of the chain to excitation of a single
dipole is investigated. Using both the linearized and the exact Hamiltonian of
the dipole chain, we detect an approximate excitation energy threshold between
a weakly and a strongly nonlinear dynamics. In the weakly nonlinear regime, the
chain approaches in the course of time the expected energy equipartition among
the dipoles. For excitations of higher energy, strongly localized excitations
appear whose trajectories in time are either periodic or irregular, relating to
the well-known discrete or chaotic breathers, respectively. The phenomenon of
spontaneous formation of domains of opposite polarization and phase locking is
found to commonly accompany the time evolution of the chaotic breathers.
Finally, the sensitivity of the dipole chain dynamics to the initial conditions
is studied as a function of the initial excitation energy by computing a fast
chaos indicator. The results of this study confirm the aforementioned
approximate threshold value for the initial excitation energy, below which the
dynamics of the dipole chain is regular and above which it is chaotic.

variant for accurately predicting the multigrid convergence of problems with
random and jumping coefficients. This LFA method is based on a specific basis
of the Fourier space rather than the commonly used Fourier modes. To show the
utility of this analysis, we consider, as an example, a simple cell-centered
multigrid method for solving a steady-state single phase flow problem in a
random porous medium. We successfully demonstrate the prediction capability of
the proposed LFA using a number of challenging benchmark problems. The
information provided by this analysis helps us to estimate a-priori the time
needed for solving certain uncertainty quantification problems by means of a
multigrid multilevel Monte Carlo method.

resulting in side-effects. We investigate in an intermediate-complexity climate
model the applicability of linear response theory (LRT) to the assessment of a
geoengineering method. This application of LRT is twofold. First, our objective
(O1) is to assess only the best possible geoengineering scenario by looking for
a suitable modulation of solar forcing that can cancel out or otherwise
modulate a climate change signal resulting from a rise in CO2 alone. Here we
consider only the cancellation of the expected global mean surface air
temperature. It is a straightforward inverse problem for this solar forcing,
and, considering an infinite time period, we use LRT to provide the solution in
the frequency domain in closed form. We provide procedures suitable for
numerical implementation that apply to finite time periods too. Second, to be
able to use LRT to quantify side-effects, the response with respect to
uncontrolled observables, such as regional must be approximately linear. Our
objective (O2) here is to assess the linearity of the response. We find that
under geoengineering in the sense of (O1) the asymptotic response of the
globally averaged temperature is actually not zero. This is due to an
inaccurate determination of the linear susceptibilities. The error is due to a
significant quadratic nonlinearity of the response. This nonlinear contribution
can be easily removed, which results in much better estimates of the linear
susceptibility, and, in turn, in a fivefold reduction in the global average
surface temperature under geoengineering. This correction dramatically improves
also the agreement of the spatial patterns of the predicted and of the true
response. However, such an agreement is not perfect and is worse in the case of
the precipitation patterns, as a result of greater degree of nonlinearity.

important role in many applications such as image retrieval, inspection
systems, face recognition, medical image processing, etc. There are many
approaches extracting texture features in gray-level images such as local
binary patterns, gray level co-occurrence matrices, statistical features,
skeleton, scale invariant feature transform, etc. The texture analysis methods
can be categorized in 4 groups titles: statistical methods, structural methods,
filter-based and model based approaches. In many related researches, authors
have tried to extract color and texture features jointly. In this respect,
combined methods are considered as efficient image analysis descriptors. Mostly
important challenges in image texture analysis are rotation sensitivity, gray
scale variations, noise sensitivity, illumination and brightness conditions,
etc. In this paper, we review most efficient and state-of-the-art image texture
analysis methods. Also, some texture classification approaches are survived.

  and Fake News Containment",,,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work is a technical approach to modeling false information nature,
design, belief impact and containment in multi-agent networks. We present a
Bayesian mathematical model for source information and viewer's belief, and how
the former impacts the latter in a media (network) of broadcasters and viewers.
Given the proposed model, we study how a particular information (true or false)
can be optimally designed into a report, so that on average it conveys the most
amount of the original intended information to the viewers of the network.
Consequently, the model allows us to study susceptibility of a particular group
of viewers to false information, as a function of statistical metrics of the
their prior beliefs (e.g. bias, hesitation, open-mindedness, credibility
assessment etc.). In addition, based on the same model we can study false
information ""containment"" strategies imposed by network administrators.
Specifically, we study a credibility assessment strategy, where every
disseminated report must be within a certain distance of the truth. We study
the trade-off between false and true information-belief convergence using this
scheme which leads to ways for optimally deciding how truth sensitive an
information dissemination network should operate.

oscillatory modes of the system are constructed and studied. The bifurcations
with period doubling and with formation of chaotic modes are found. Their
attractors are constructed. The full spectra of indices and divergencies for
the obtained modes, the values of KS-entropies, horizons of predictability, and
Lyapunov dimensions of strange attractors are calculated. Some conclusions
