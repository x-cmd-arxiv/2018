hyperspectral image, as well as estimating the size of the EM set, plays an
important role in multispectral image processing. In this paper, we present
condition-residuum-diagrams. By plotting the residuum resulting from the
unmixing and reconstruction and the condition number of various EM sets, the
resulting diagram provides insight into the behavior of the spectral unmixing
under a varying amount of endmembers (EMs). Furthermore, we utilize
condition-residuum-diagrams to realize an EM reduction algorithm that starts
with an initially extracted, over-complete EM set. An over-complete EM set
commonly exhibits a good unmixing result, i.e. a lower reconstruction residuum,
but due to its partial redundancy, the unmixing gets numerically unstable, i.e.
the unmixed abundances values are less reliable. Our greedy reduction scheme
improves the EM set by reducing the condition number, i.e. enhancing the set's
stability, while keeping the reconstruction error as low as possible. The
resulting set sequence gives hint to the optimal EM set and its size. We
demonstrate the benefit of our condition-residuum-diagram and reduction scheme
on well-studied datasets with known reference EM set sizes for several
well-known EE algorithms.

  Task-Focused Attention",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Several recent studies have demonstrated the promise of deep visuomotor
policies for robot manipulator control. Despite impressive progress, these
systems are known to be vulnerable to physical disturbances, such as accidental
or adversarial bumps that make them drop the manipulated object. They also tend
to be distracted by visual disturbances such as objects moving in the robot's
field of view, even if the disturbance does not physically prevent the
execution of the task. In this paper, we propose an approach for augmenting a
deep visuomotor policy trained through demonstrations with Task Focused visual
Attention (TFA). The manipulation task is specified with a natural language
text such as `move the red bowl to the left'. This allows the visual attention
component to concentrate on the current object that the robot needs to
manipulate. We show that even in benign environments, the TFA allows the policy
to consistently outperform a variant with no attention mechanism. More
importantly, the new policy is significantly more robust: it regularly recovers
from severe physical disturbances (such as bumps causing it to drop the object)
from which the baseline policy, i.e. with no visual attention, almost never
recovers. In addition, we show that the proposed policy performs correctly in
the presence of a wide class of visual disturbances, exhibiting a behavior
reminiscent of human selective visual attention experiments. Our proposed
approach consists of a VAE-GAN network which encodes the visual input and feeds
it to a Motor network that moves the robot joints. Also, our approach benefits
from a teacher network for the TFA that leverages textual input command to
robustify the visual encoder against various types of disturbances.

$\phi (r)=\epsilon_r$ if the two interacting particles are overlapped
($r<\sigma$), $\phi(r)=-\epsilon_a$ inside a corona ($\sigma <r<\lambda$), and
$\phi(r)=0$ otherwise ($r>\lambda$). Thus, the potential reduces to the
conventional square-well (SW) one in the limit $\epsilon_r\to\infty$ and to the
penetrable-sphere (PS) potential if $\epsilon_a\to0$ or $\lambda\to\sigma$.
This paper aims at studying the temperature dependence of the Navier--Stokes
transport coefficients of a dilute gas of particles interacting via the PSW
model. By exploiting the fact that the PSW scattering process is analogous to
that of a light ray passing through two concentric spherical media with
different refractive indices, the scattering angle is analytically derived as a
function of the impact parameter and the relative velocity of the colliding
particles; depending on the values of those two quantities, collisions can be
soft, hard, or grazing. Next, by standard application of known general results
from the Chapman--Enskog method, the Navier--Stokes transport coefficients in
the first-order approximation are numerically evaluated. It is found that the
PSW coefficients are practically indistinguishable from the SW ones for
temperatures low enough ($k_BT\lesssim 0.2 \epsilon_r$), there exists a
transition regime ($0.2 \epsilon_r\lesssim k_BT\lesssim 10\epsilon_r$) where
the transport coefficients interpolate between the SW and the PS ones, and
finally the PSW coefficients are comparable to the PS ones for high enough
temperatures ($k_BT\gtrsim 10\epsilon_r$). The results are applied to the
temperature profiles of the planar Fourier flow.

analysis for ensuring that, even when an adversarial environment removes a

all the security constraints. Wang and Li proposed three notions of workflow
resiliency: static, decremental, and dynamic resiliency. While decremental and
dynamic resiliency are both PSPACE-complete, Wang and Li did not provide a
matching lower and upper bound for the complexity of static resiliency.
  The present work begins with proving that static resiliency is
$\Pi_2^p$-complete, thereby bridging a long-standing complexity gap in the
literature. In addition, a fourth notion of workflow resiliency, one-shot
resiliency, is proposed and shown to remain in the third level of the

in the gravitational-waves they emit and can be measured using parameterised
waveform models. Accurately and efficiently describing the complicated
precessional dynamics of the various angular momenta of the system in these
waveform models is the object of active investigation. One of the key models
extensively used in the analysis of LIGO and Virgo data is the
single-precessing-spin waveform model IMRPhenomPv2. In this article we present
a new model IMRPhenomPv3 which includes the effects of two independent spins in
the precession dynamics. Whereas IMRPhenomPv2 utilizes a single-spin
frequency-dependent post-Newtonian rotation to describe precession effects, the
improved model, IMRPhenomPv3, employs a double-spin rotation that is based on
recent developments in the description of precessional dynamics. Besides
double-spin precession, the improved model benefits from a more accurate
description of precessional effects. We validate our new model against a large
set of precessing numerical-relativity simulations. We find that IMRPhenomPv3
has better agreement with the inspiral portion of precessing binary-black-hole
simulations and is more robust across a larger region of the parameter space
than IMRPhenomPv2. As a first application we analyse, for the first time, the
gravitational-wave event GW151226 with a waveform model that describes two-spin
precession. Within statistical uncertainty our results are consistent with
published results. IMRPhenomPv3 will allow studies of the measurability of
individual spins of binary black holes using GWs and can be used as a
foundation upon which to build further improvements, such as modeling
precession through merger, extending to higher multipoles, and including tidal
effects.

subjective nature. Moreover, many factors influence VQA. Compression of video
content, while necessary for minimising transmission and storage requirements,
introduces distortions which can have detrimental effects on the perceived
quality. Especially when dealing with modern video coding standards, it is
extremely difficult to model the effects of compression due to the
unpredictability of encoding on different content types. Moreover, transmission
also introduces delays and other distortion types which affect the perceived
quality. Therefore, it would be highly beneficial to accurately predict the
perceived quality of video to be distributed over modern content distribution
platforms, so that specific actions could be undertaken to maximise the Quality
of Experience (QoE) of the users. Traditional VQA techniques based on feature
extraction and modelling may not be sufficiently accurate. In this paper, a
novel Deep Learning (DL) framework is introduced for effectively predicting VQA
of video content delivery mechanisms based on end-to-end feature learning. The
proposed framework is based on Convolutional Neural Networks, taking into
account compression distortion as well as transmission delays. Training and
evaluation of the proposed framework are performed on a user annotated VQA
dataset specifically created to undertake this work. The experiments show that
the proposed methods can lead to high accuracy of the quality estimation,
showcasing the potential of using DL in complex VQA scenarios.

limited to over and under voltages, excessive line losses, overloading of
transformers and feeders, and protection failure. To avoid such potential
negative impacts, the concept of hosting capacity is introduced and used. The
hosting capacity is defined as the total capacity of DERs that can be
integrated into a given feeder/microgrid without exceeding operational
restrictions and/or requiring system upgrades. Hosting capacity studies are
primarily done based on steadystate analyses. However, in case of microgrids
and when transitioning between grid-connected and islanded modes, dynamic
operation becomes more restrictive than steady-state operation and thus is
worthy of detailed investigation to provide a better understanding of the
amount of DER that the microgrid can host. This paper examines this problem and
provides extensive simulations on a practical test system to show its
importance and merits.

(QSO) at $z \gtrsim 4$ has motivated Madau and Haardt to investigate a
reionization scenario in which active galactic nuclei dominate the photon
budget at all times. Their analytical study reveals that this picture is in
agreement with the evolution of the HI volume fraction in the intergalactic
medium (IGM) and the optical depth to Thomson scattering of the cosmic
microwave background. We employ a suite of hydrodynamical simulations
post-processed with a radiative transfer code to further investigate the
properties of such a reionization history. In particular, we generate synthetic
absorption-line spectra for HI and HeII that we compare with observational
data. Although we confirm the analytical results mentioned above, we also find
that the evolution of the IGM temperature and of the HeII optical depth are at
odds with current observational constraints. Nevertheless, the QSO-dominated
scenario presents the attractive feature that it naturally generates an
inhomogeneous IGM and thus produces an extended tail at high values in the
distribution function of the HI effective optical depth, in agreement with
recent observations. We find tentative evidence that considering some QSO
emission at redshift $z \gtrsim 5$ could reconcile such observations with
numerical simulations that have so far failed to reproduce this feature.
Finally, we show that collecting more HeII-absorption spectra at $z \gtrsim 3$

constraining the QSO contribution to reionization.

contrast to corresponding axisymmetric (2D) simulations, which confirm previous
claims that the RbR+ approximation can foster explosions in 2D in particular in
models with powerful axial sloshing of the stalled shock due to the standing
accretion shock instability (SASI). However, while local and instantaneous
variations of neutrino fluxes and heating rates can still be considerably
higher with RbR+ transport in 3D, the time-averaged quantities are very similar
to FMD results because of the absence of a fixed, artificial symmetry axis that
channels the flow. Therefore, except for stochastic fluctuations, the neutrino
signals and the post-bounce evolution of 3D simulations with FMD and RbR+
transport are also very similar, in particular for our calculations with the
better grid resolution. Higher spatial resolution has clearly a more important

time-evolving direction and overall properties fully consistent with the LESA
phenomenon. Models with RbR+ transport develop LESA dipoles somewhat faster and
with temporarily higher amplitudes, but the FMD calculations exhibit cleaner
hemispheric asymmetries with a far more dominant dipole. In contrast, the RbR+
results display much wider multipole spectra of the neutrino-emission
anisotropies with significant power also in the quadrupole and higher-order
modes. Our results disprove speculations that LESA is a numerical artifact of
RbR+ transport. We also discuss LESA as consequence of a dipolar convection

quantum memory and in the case of topological codes, they form useful models
for topological phases of matter. In this paper, we discuss the theory of
stabilizer codes as a discrete version of a linear gauge structure, a concept
we introduce here. A linear gauge structure captures all the familiar
ingredients of $U(1)$ gauge theory including a generalization of charge
conservation, Maxwell equations and topological terms. Using this connection,
we prove some important results for stabilizer codes which can be used to
characterize their error-correction properties. However, this perspective does
not depend on any particular Hamiltonian or Lagrangian, which as a consequence
is agnostic to the source of the gauge redundancy. Based upon the connection to
stabilizer codes, we view the source of the gauge redundancy as an ambiguity in
the tensor product structure of the Hilbert space. That is, the gauge provides
a set of equivalent but arbitrary ways to factorize the Hilbert space. We apply
this formalism to the $d=2$ and $3$ toric code as well as the paradigm fracton
models, X-Cube and Haah's cubic code. From this perspective, we are able to map
all these models to some continuum version which captures all or some of the

spectrum of light particles consisting of both stable and unstable dark mesons.
The simultaneous presence of these two types of particles can lead to novel
mechanisms for generating the correct dark matter relic abundance, which in
turn can reflect themselves into new exotic signatures at colliders. We study
the viability of such sectors for various Hidden Valley models and map the
valid parameter space to possible collider signatures. Mediators studied
include various scalar bifundamentals and a heavy $Z'$. It is shown that in
general bounds from direct and indirect detection can easily be avoided. In
most of the allowed parameter space, the relic density is determined by stable
mesons annihilating to unstable ones which in turn decay quickly to Standard
Model particles. Dark mesons that decay mainly to heavier Standard Model
fermions allow for more valid parameter space, though dark mesons are still
allowed to decay exclusively to some of the lighter fermions. Possible exotic
collider signatures include displaced vertices, emerging jets and semivisible
jets.

underestimated by almost a factor of 3, and by a factor of 2 between 3000 and

bias in different stellar mass and luminosity bins. We focus on comparing the
clustering dependence on these two properties. While UV-luminosity is only
related to recent starbursts of a galaxy, stellar mass reflects the integrated
build-up of the whole star formation history, which should make it more tightly
correlated with halo mass. Hence, the clustering segregation with stellar mass
is expected to be larger than with luminosity. However, our measurements
suggest that the segregation with luminosity is larger with $\simeq 90\%$
confidence (neglecting contributions from systematic errors). We compare this
unexpected result with predictions from the \textsc{Meraxes} semi-analytic
galaxy formation model. Interestingly, the model reproduces the observed
angular correlation functions, and also suggests stronger clustering
segregation with luminosity. The comparison between our observations and the

of CN (HCN) abundances being about an order of magnitude higher (lower) in the

coefficient acquires asymptotic value $6.5552$ times the bulk value of
$\pi^2/3$. The relaxation time is shown to be renormalized by the inverse of
the square of the gap, and so, leads to a ballistic regime in the linear Dirac

the Standard Model. We consider several dark sectors with fermions that
transform under the electroweak group, as arise from a variety of models
including strongly-coupled theories of dark matter (e.g., stealth dark matter),
bosonic technicolor (strongly-coupled indcued electroweak symmetry breaking),
vector-like confinement, etc. We consider theories with two and four flavors
under an $SU(N)$ strong group that acquire variously chiral, vector-like, and
mixed contributions to their masses. We construct the non-linear sigma model
describing the dark pions and match the ultraviolet theory onto a low energy
effective theory that provides the leading interactions of the lightest dark
pions with the Standard Model. We uncover two distinct classes of effective
theories that are distinguishable by how the lightest dark pions decay:
""Gaugephilic"": where $\pi^0 \rightarrow Z h$, $\pi^\pm \rightarrow W h$
dominate once kinematically open, and ""Gaugephobic"": where $\pi^0 \rightarrow
\bar{f} f$, $\pi^\pm \rightarrow \bar{f}' f$ dominate. Custodial $SU(2)$ plays
a critical role in determining the ""philic"" or ""phobic"" nature of a model. In
dark sectors that preserve custodial $SU(2)$, there is no axial anomaly, and so
the decay $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ is highly suppressed. In a companion

These dark sectors consist of composites formed from constituents that are
charged under the electroweak group and interact with the Higgs, but are
neutral under Standard Model color. In these scenarios, the most promising
target is the dark meson sector, consisting of dark vector-mesons as well as
dark pions. In this paper we study dark meson production and decay at the LHC
in theories that preserve a global SU(2) dark flavor symmetry. Dark pions can
be pair-produced through resonant dark vector meson production, $p
p\to\rho_D\to\pi_D\pi_D$, and decay in one of two distinct ways: gaugephobic,
when $\pi_D\to f\bar{f}'$ generally dominates; or gaugephilic, when $\pi_D\to
W+h,Z+h$ dominates once kinematically open. Unlike QCD, the decay
$\pi^0_D\to\gamma\gamma$ is virtually absent due to the dark flavor symmetry.
We recast a vast set of LHC searches to determine the current constraints on
dark meson production and decay. When $m_{\rho_D}$ is slightly heavier than $2
m_{\pi_D}$ and $\rho_D^{\pm,0}$ kinetically mixes with the weak gauge bosons,
the 8 TeV same-sign lepton search strategy sets the best bound, $m_{\pi_D}>500$
GeV. Yet, when only the $\rho^0_D$ kinetically mixes with hypercharge, we find
the strongest LHC bound is $m_{\pi_D}>130$ GeV, that is only slightly better
than what LEP II achieved. We find the relative insensitivity of LHC searches,
especially at 13 TeV, can be blamed mainly on their penchant for high mass
objects or large MET. Dedicated searches would undoubtedly yield substantially
improved sensitivity. We provide a GitHub page to speed the implementation of
these searches in future LHC analyses. Our findings provide a strong motivation
for model-independent searches of the form $pp\to A\to B+C\to SM\, SM+SM\, SM$

compressible, turbulent, as well as flows involving further physics such as
non-equilibrium internal energy exchange and chemical reactions. Despite its
wide applicability, deterministic solution of the Boltzmann equation presents a
huge computational challenge, and often the collision operator is simplified
for practical reasons. In this work, we introduce a highly accurate
deterministic method for the full Boltzmann equation which couples the
Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) discretization in time and physical

encompasses three aspects: first, the fast spectral method for the collision
operator applies to general collision kernels with little or no practical
limitations, and in order to adapt to the spatial discretization, we propose
here a singular-value-decomposition based algorithm to further reduce the cost
in evaluating the collision term; second, the DG formulation employed has high
order of accuracy at element-level, and has shown to be more efficient than the
finite volume method; thirdly, the element-local compact nature of DG as well
as our collision algorithm is amenable to effective parallelization on
massively parallel architectures. The solver has been verified against
analytical Bobylev-Krook-Wu solution. Further, the standard benchmark test
cases of rarefied Fourier heat transfer, Couette flow, oscillatory Couette

radiation force on the cooler, more opaque outer layers can balance or exceed
the force of gravity. These near or super-Eddington outer envelopes represent a
long standing challenge for calculating the evolution of massive stars in one
dimension, a situation that limits our understanding of the stellar progenitors
of some of the most exciting and energetic explosions in the universe. In
particular, the proximity to the Eddington limit has been the suspected cause
for the variability, large mass loss rate and giant eruptions of an enigmatic
class of massive stars: the luminous blue variables (LBVs). When in quiescence,
LBVs are usually found on the hot ($T_{eff} \approx 2 - 4 \times 10^4$ K) S Dor
instability strip. While in outburst, most LBVs stay on the cold S Dor
instability strip with a $T_{eff} \approx 9000$ K. Here we show that physically
realistic three dimensional global radiation hydrodynamic simulations of
radiation dominated massive stars with the largest supercomputers in the world
naturally reproduce many observed properties of LBVs, specifically their
location in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and their episodic mass loss
with rates of $10^{-7}-10^{-5} M_{\odot}/yr$. The helium opacity peak is found
to play an important role to determine these properties, which is not realized
in the traditional one dimensional models of massive stars. The simulations
also predict that convection causes irregular envelope oscillations and 10-30%
brightness variations on a typical timescale of a few days. The variability is
more prominent in our models that are on the cool part of the S Dor
instability. These calculations pave the way to a quantitative understanding of
the structure, stability and the dominant mode of mass loss of massive stars.

used to compute the emissivities, opacities and average ionization states of
carbon (C) and polystyrene (CH) plasmas in the warm-dense matter regime in
which the coupling constant varies between 0.02 to 2.0. The accuracy of results
of STA calculations is assessed by benchmarking against the available
experimental data and results obtained using other theoretical methods,
assuming that a state of local thermodynamic equilibrium exists in the plasma.
In the case of a carbon plasma, the STA method yields spectral features that
are in reasonably-good agreement with Dirac-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Slater
theories; in the case of CH, we find that STA-derived opacities are very
similar to those derived using quantum-molecular-dynamics density-functional
theory and Hartree-Fock method down to plasma temperature of about 20 eV. Our
calculations also compare favorably with available experimental measurements of
Gamboa {\it et al} [High Energy Density Phys. {\bf 11}, 75 (2014)] of the
plasma temperature and average ionization state behind a blast wave in a pure
carbon foam. Although the STA-computed average-ionization charge state in the
rarefaction region appears to be lower than the experimental data, it is within
the experimental uncertainty and the discrepancy is nevertheless consistent
with results reported using an atomic kinetic model. In addition, we further
predict the temperature dependence of average ionization states of CH plasma in
the same temperature range as for the carbon plasma.

their surrounding environments on all physical scales, from Galactic binary
systems to galaxies and galaxy clusters. An important avenue to understand the
formation of these jets is by characterising the systems and circumstances from
which they are launched. Whenever a black hole or neutron star accretes matter,
it appears to inevitably result in the launching of a jet, the only exception
being the most common type of accreting neutron stars: those with strong ($B
\geq 10^{12}$ G) magnetic fields. This exception has created the paradigm that
strong magnetic fields inhibit the formation of jets. Here, we report the
discovery of a jet launched by a strongly-magnetised neutron star that is
accreting above the Eddington limit, disproving this long-standing paradigm.
The radio luminosity of the jet is two orders of magnitude fainter than seen in
other neutron stars, implying an important role for the neutron star's
properties in regulating jet power. This jet detection necessitates fundamental
revision of current neutron star jet models and opens up new tests of jet
theory for all accreting systems. It also shows that the strong magnetic fields
of ultra-luminous X-ray pulsars do not prevent such sources from launching
jets.

to this question in the negative, presenting two counterexamples in which
uniqueness of the flow of the vector field holds but one can construct
non-trivial signed measure-valued solutions to the continuity equation with

coherent structures are revealed, twelve in L1688 and six in B18, each of which
shows a sharp ""transition to coherence"" in velocity dispersion around its
periphery. The identification of these structures provides a chance to study
the coherent structures in molecular clouds statistically. The identified
coherent structures have a typical radius of 0.04 pc and a typical mass of 0.4
Msun, generally smaller than previously known coherent cores identified by
Goodman et al. (1998), Caselli et al. (2002), and Pineda et al. (2010). We call

cores, these structures are not virially bound by self-gravity and are instead
predominantly confined by ambient pressure. The droplets have density profiles
shallower than a critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere, and they have a velocity (VLSR)

These results point to a potential formation mechanism through pressure
compression and turbulent processes in the dense gas. We present a comparison

of field helicity (RHELT) and energy (RET) between a donor and an acceptor,
both being dipolar, magnetoelectric and bi-isotropic, chiral in particular,
with rotating excited dipoles. We introduce orientational factors that control
this process. Also, a RHELT and RET interaction radius is put forward. The
detection of RHELT adds a wealth of information contained in the helicity of
the transferred fields, never used or established to date. The nature of these
dipolar magnetoelectric bi-isotropic particles and/or molecules with induced
dipoles possessing angular momentum, enriches the number of variables and
associated effects. Hence the landscape involved in this transfer phenomenon,
never explored before, is significantly broader than in conventional FRET. In
this way, chiral interacting objects convey terms in the equations of transfer
rate of helicity and energy that are discriminatory, so that one can extract
information on their structural chirality handedness and polarization rotation.
As such, not only the rate of electromagnetic helicity transfer, but also that
of energy transfer may be negative, which for the latter means an enhanced
emission from the donor in pressence of acceptor, a phenomenon which does not
exist in conventional FRET. Importantly, both the RHELT and RET rates, as well
as the RHELT interaction radius, are very sensitive to changes in the helicity,
or state of polarization, of the illumination, as well as to the polarization
of the excited electric and magnetic dipole moments of donor and acceptor.
Finally, we introduce the observable quanties in terms of which one can obtain
the transfer rates and interaction radii.

1.96(8) Debye), and the T1 spin lifetime in low magnetic fields is longer than
previously thought (> 4.6(1.5) hours). We furthermore determined the optical
excited state lifetime (7.7(4) ns), and therefore the natural radiative

(IBCs) as a technique of avoiding the problem of ultraviolet divergence in
non-relativistic quantum field theories while treating space as a continuum and
electrons as point particles. An IBC can be expressed in the particle-position
representation of a Fock vector $\psi$ as a condition on the values of $\psi$
on the set of collision configurations, and the corresponding Hamiltonian is
defined on a domain of vectors satisfying this condition. We describe here how
Bohmian mechanics can be extended to this type of Hamiltonian. In fact, part of
the development of IBCs was inspired by the Bohmian picture. Particle creation
and annihilation correspond to jumps in configuration space; the annihilation
is deterministic and occurs when two particles (of the appropriate species)
meet, whereas the creation is stochastic and occurs at a rate dictated by the
demand for the equivariance of the $|\psi|^2$ distribution, time reversal
symmetry, and the Markov property. The process is closely related to processes
known as Bell-type quantum field theories.

parameterized by the magnetic axis shape along with three other real numbers,

generate good initial conditions for conventional optimization, and its speed

T_2$ which is completely nonunitary. The idea is to use the Sz.-Nagy-Foias
functional model for $T$ as the model space also for the commutative tuple

operator, and identify what added structure is required to classify such
commutative contractive factorizations $T = T_1 T_2$ up to unitary equivalence.
In addition to the characteristic function $\Theta_T$, we identify additional
invariants $({\mathbb G}, {\mathbb W})$ which can be used to construct a
functional model for the commuting pair $(T_1, T_2)$ and which have good
uniqueness properties: if two commutative contractive pairs $(T_1, T_2)$ and
$(T'_1, T'_2)$ are unitarily equivalent, then their characteristic triples
$(\Theta, {\mathbb G}, {\mathbb W})_T$ and $(\Theta, {\mathbb G}, {\mathbb

simple cases where the characteristic triples can be explicitly computed. This
work extends earlier results of Berger-Coburn-Lebow \cite{B-C-L} for the case

approximations for a class of affine parametric saddle point problems. Such
problems can be found in many computational science and engineering fields,
including the Stokes equations for viscous incompressible flow, mixed
formulation of diffusion equations for heat conduction or groundwater flow,
time-harmonic Maxwell equations for electromagnetics, etc. Due to the lack of
knowledge or intrinsic randomness, the coefficients of such problems are
uncertain and can often be represented or approximated by high- or countably
infinite-dimensional random parameters equipped with suitable probability
distributions, and the coefficients affinely depend on a series of either
globally or locally supported basis functions, e.g., Karhunen--Lo\`eve
expansion, piecewise polynomials, or adaptive wavelet approximations.
Consequently, we are faced with solving affine parametric saddle point
problems. Here we study sparse polynomial approximations of the parametric
solutions, in particular sparse Taylor approximations, and their convergence
properties for these parametric problems. With suitable sparsity assumptions on
the parametrization, we obtain the algebraic convergence rates $O(N^{-r})$ for
the sparse polynomial approximations of the parametric solutions, in cases of
both globally and locally supported basis functions. We prove that $r$ depends
only on a sparsity parameter in the parametrization of the random input, and in
particular does not depend on the number of active parameter dimensions or the
number of polynomial terms $N$. These results imply that sparse polynomial
approximations can effectively break the curse of dimensionality, thereby
establishing a theoretical foundation for the development and application of
such practical algorithms as adaptive, least-squares, and compressive sensing
constructions.

they provide collision-free path solutions regardless of obstacle geometry in a
given environment. However, their computational complexity increases
significantly with the dimensionality of the motion planning problem. Adaptive
sampling is one of the ways to speed up SMPs by sampling a particular region of
a configuration space that is more likely to contain an optimal path solution.
Although there are a wide variety of algorithms for adaptive sampling, they
rely on hand-crafted heuristics; furthermore, their performance decreases
significantly in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present a neural
network-based adaptive sampler for motion planning called Deep Sampling-based
Motion Planner (DeepSMP). DeepSMP generates samples for SMPs and enhances their
overall speed significantly while exhibiting efficient scalability to
higher-dimensional problems. DeepSMP's neural architecture comprises of a
Contractive AutoEncoder which encodes given workspaces directly from a raw
point cloud data, and a Dropout-based stochastic deep feedforward neural
network which takes the workspace encoding, start and goal configuration, and
iteratively generates feasible samples for SMPs to compute end-to-end
collision-free optimal paths. DeepSMP is not only consistently computationally
efficient in all tested environments but has also shown remarkable
generalization to completely unseen environments. We evaluate DeepSMP on
multiple planning problems including planning of a point-mass robot,
rigid-body, 6-link robotic manipulator in various 2D and 3D environments. The
results show that on average our method is at least 7 times faster in
point-mass and rigid-body case and about 28 times faster in 6-link robot case

policies that are parameterized in a way that makes them easily reusable. This
diversity and parameterization of low-level skills allows us to find a
transferable policy that is able to use combinations and variations of
different skills to solve more complex, high-level tasks. In particular, we
first use simulation to jointly learn a policy for a set of low-level skills,
and a ""skill embedding"" parameterization which can be used to compose them.
Later, we learn high-level policies which actuate the low-level policies via
this skill embedding parameterization. The high-level policies encode how and
when to reuse the low-level skills together to achieve specific high-level
tasks. Importantly, our method learns to control a real robot in joint-space to
achieve these high-level tasks with little or no on-robot time, despite the
fact that the low-level policies may not be perfectly transferable from
simulation to real, and that the low-level skills were not trained on any
examples of high-level tasks. We illustrate the principles of our method using
informative simulation experiments. We then verify its usefulness for real
robotics problems by learning, transferring, and composing free-space and
contact motion skills on a Sawyer robot using only joint-space control. We
experiment with several techniques for composing pre-learned skills, and find
that our method allows us to use both learning-based approaches and efficient
search-based planning to achieve high-level tasks using only pre-learned

the central 100 pc area around an AGN, down to the pc scale, is key for
understanding how the very final transfer of matter from kpc scale to the
sub-parsec size of the accretion disc is achieved. Using AO-assisted
(SPHERE-VLT) near-IR images in H and Ks and narrow-band of the Seyfert 2 galaxy
NGC1068 we analyse the radial distribution of brightness in the central r < 100
pc area down to the pc scale. The median-averaged radial profiles are adjusted
by a cusp (power-law) plus a central point-source. A simple radiative transfer
model is used to interpret the data. We find that the fit of profiles beyond
10pc is done quite precisely at Ks by a cusp of exponent -2.0 plus a central
point-source and by a cusp of exponent -1.2 at H. The difference between H and
Ks can be explained by differential extinction, provided that the distribution
of dust is itself cuspy as r^-1. However, the required stellar density follows
a r^-4 cusp, much steeper than any other cusp theoretically predicted and the
mass of the cluster is unreasonable, even introducing a segregation in the
stellar population with an excess of giant stars inward. A much more acceptable
solution is found with a K profile dominated by warm dust emission, while the H
profile corresponds to a stellar cusp. NGC1068 is shown to satisfy a
relationship between half-light radius, cusp luminosity and exponent which
suggests that the cusp is the remnant of a recent starbust. We identify the
central point-like source with the very hot dust at the internal wall of the
putative torus and derive an intrinsic luminosity that requires an overall
extinction AK ~ 8, a value consistent with predictions by several models.

Model reduction is known very challenging for high-dimensional parametric
problems whose solutions also live in high-dimensional manifolds. However, the
manifold of some quantity of interest (QoI) depending on the parametric
solutions may be low-dimensional. We use the Hessian of the QoI with respect to
the parameter to detect this low-dimensionality, and draw training samples by
projecting the high-dimensional parameter to a low-dimensional subspace spanned
by the eigenvectors of the Hessian corresponding to its dominating eigenvalues.
Instead of forming the full Hessian, which is computationally intractable for a
high-dimensional parameter, we employ a randomized algorithm to efficiently
compute the dominating eigenpairs of the Hessian whose cost does not depend on
the nominal dimension of the parameter but only on the intrinsic dimension of
the QoI. We demonstrate that the Hessian-based sampling leads to much smaller
errors of the reduced basis approximation for the QoI compared to a random
sampling for a diffusion equation with random input obeying either uniform or

method to reconstruct subsurface velocity image. Waveform inversion is a
typical non-linear and ill-posed inverse problem. Existing physics-driven
computational methods for solving waveform inversion suffer from the cycle
skipping and local minima issues, and not to mention solving waveform inversion
is computationally expensive. In recent years, data-driven methods become a
promising way to solve the waveform inversion problem. However, most deep
learning frameworks suffer from generalization and over-fitting issue. In this
paper, we developed a real-time data-driven technique and we call it
VelocityGAN, to accurately reconstruct subsurface velocities. Our VelocityGAN
is built on a generative adversarial network (GAN) and trained end-to-end to
learn a mapping function from the raw seismic waveform data to the velocity
image. Different from other encoder-decoder based data-driven seismic waveform
inversion approaches, our VelocityGAN learns regularization from data and
further impose the regularization to the generator so that inversion accuracy
is improved. We further develop a transfer learning strategy based on
VelocityGAN to alleviate the generalization issue. A series of experiments are
conducted on the synthetic seismic reflection data to evaluate the
effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization of VelocityGAN. We not only
compare it with existing physics-driven approaches and data-driven frameworks

  The second part considers the structural implications when a joint

conserves the same quantities with RMHD. The noncanonical Hamiltonian and Nambu
description of this generic system are derived and in addition a canonical
description is formed by Clebsch-parameterizing the vorticity and the magnetic
flux function. The method for the construction of the dynamical equations is
based on the imposition of the conservation laws as orthogonality conditions.
Furthermore, this approach enabled us to construct three families of models
that respect any combination of two out of the three conservation laws. Some of
these models can serve as conservative regularizations of RMHD since under
certain conditions they keep the enstrophy bounded without the need of
introducing viscosity and may be candidates for incorporating small length
scale physics into the RMHD framework.

expand the parameter space by extending the model to include bulk fermions. We
do so, and show that for any choice of parameters, the model remains in

discuss the absolutely crucial property of {\em isospectrality} of the
aforementioned transformations which guarantees that the quasinormal mode (QNM)
spectra of potentials, related via the transformation, completely coincide. We
demonstrate that, while the first two types of the Darboux transformations (DT
and BDT) are indeed isospectral, the situation is wildly different for the GDT:
it violates the isospectrality requirement and is therefore only valid for the
solutions with just one fixed frequency. Furthermore, it is shown that although
in this case the GDT does provide a relationship between two arbitrary
potentials (a short-ranged and a long-ranged potentials relationship being just
a trivial example), this relationship ends up being completely formal. Finally,
we consider frequency-dependent potentials. A new generalization of the Darboux
transformation is constructed for them and it is proven (on a concrete example)
that such transformations are also not isospectral. In short, we demonstrate
how a little, almost incorporeal flaw may become a major problem for an
otherwise perfectly admirable goal of mathematical generalization.

the image of the same person under the new pose, synthesizing novel views of

This problem has recently been addressed in a supervised manner, i.e., during
training the ground truth images under the new poses are given to the network.
We go beyond these approaches by proposing a fully unsupervised strategy. We
tackle this challenging scenario by splitting the problem into two principal
subtasks. First, we consider a pose conditioned bidirectional generator that
maps back the initially rendered image to the original pose, hence being
directly comparable to the input image without the need to resort to any
training image. Second, we devise a novel loss function that incorporates
content and style terms, and aims at producing images of high perceptual

interacting electrons, holes and photons in a semiconductor microcavity, where
the loss of cavity photons into vacuum is of particular importance. The method
incorporates correlation and fluctuation processes beyond mean-field theory in
a wide parameter range of detuning, Coulomb interaction, light-matter coupling
and damping, even in the case when the number of quasiparticle excitations is
large. This enables the description of exciton and polariton formation, and
their possible condensation through spontaneous phase symmetry breaking by
analyzing the ground-state, steady-state and spectral properties of a rather
generic electron-hole-photon Hamiltonian, which also includes the coupling to
two fermionic baths and a free-space photon reservoir. Thereby, the
steady-state behavior of the system is obtained by evaluating expectation
values in the long-time limit by means of the Mori-Zwanzig projection
technique. Tracking and tracing different order parameters, the fully

where better perplexity typically comes at the cost of greater computation
complexity. In a software keyboard application on mobile devices, this
translates into higher power consumption and shorter battery life. This paper
represents the first attempt, to our knowledge, in exploring
accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs for NLMs. Building on quasi-recurrent neural
networks (QRNNs), we apply pruning techniques to provide a ""knob"" to select
different operating points. In addition, we propose a simple technique to
recover some perplexity using a negligible amount of memory. Our empirical
evaluations consider both perplexity as well as energy consumption on a
Raspberry Pi, where we demonstrate which methods provide the best
perplexity-power consumption operating point. At one operating point, one of
the techniques is able to provide energy savings of 40% over the state of the
art with only a 17% relative increase in perplexity.

virial mass ($M_v$) of cosmic structures in the context of $\Lambda$CDM model
and in an $f(R)$ model of modified gravity -- namely, the Hu-Sawicki model. The
$R_t$ is the distance from the center of the cosmic structure to the shell that
is detaching from the Hubble flow at a given time, while the $M_v$ is defined,
for this work, as the mass enclosed within the volume where the density is
$200$ times the background density. We consider that gravitationally bound
astrophysical systems follow a Navarro-Frenk-White density profile, while
beyond the virial radius ($R_v$) the profile is approximated by the 2-halo term
of the matter correlation function. By combining them together with the
information drawn from solving the spherical collapse for the structures, we
are able to connect two observables: the $R_t$ and the $M_v$. We show that, in
$\Lambda$CDM, the turnaround mass ($M_t$) at $z=0$ is related to the $M_v$ of
that same structure by $M_t \simeq 3.07 \, M_v$, while in terms of the radii we
have that $R_t \simeq 3.7 \, R_v$ (for $M_v$ of $10^{13} \, h^{-1} \,
M_\odot$). In the $f(R)$ model, we have $M_t \simeq 3.43 \, M_v$ and $R_t
\simeq 4.1 \, R_v$, for $|f_{R0}|=10^{-6}$ and the same mass scale. Therefore,
the difference between $\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ in terms of these observable
relations is of order $\sim 10-20\%$ even for a relatively mild strength of the
modification of gravity ($|f_{R0}|=10^{-6}$). For the $R_t$ itself we find a
difference of $\sim 9\%$ between the weakly modification in gravity considered
in this work ($|f_{R0}|=10^{-6}$) and $\Lambda$CDM for a mass of $10^{13} \,
h^{-1} \, M_\odot$. Once observations allow precisions of this order or better
in measurements $R_t$, as well as the $M_v$, these quantities will become
powerful tests of modified gravity.

realistic cases, the local heat generation in kiloWatt-class fiber amplifiers
is either dominated by the quantum defect or the parasitic absorption depending
on the pump wavelength. In conventional designs, radiative cooling can be
substantial only in properly designed amplifiers, when the pump power is tens
of watts or lower, unless the parasitic absorption is reduced compared to the
commonly reported values in the literature. We also explore the impact of the
non-ideal quantum efficiency of the gain material. The developed formalism can

posed by Alon, Mossel, and Pemantle '15. In this model, each vertex of a graph
can be either truthful or corrupt. Each vertex reports about the types
(truthful or corrupt) of all its neighbors to a central agency, where truthful
nodes report the true types they see and corrupt nodes report adversarially.
The central agency aggregates these reports and attempts to find a single
truthful node. Inspired by real auditing networks, we pose our problem for
arbitrary graphs and consider corruption through a computational lens. We
identify a key combinatorial parameter of the graph $m(G)$, which is the
minimal number of corrupted agents needed to prevent the central agency from
identifying a single truthful node. We give an efficient (in fact, linear time)
algorithm for the central agency to identify a truthful node that is successful
whenever the number of corrupt nodes is less than $m(G)/2$. On the other hand,
we prove that for any constant $\alpha > 1$, it is NP-hard to find a subset of
nodes $S$ in $G$ such that corrupting $S$ prevents the central agency from
finding one truthful node and $|S| \leq \alpha m(G)$, assuming the Small Set
Expansion Hypothesis (Raghavendra and Steurer, STOC '10). We conclude that
being corrupt requires being clever, while detecting corruption does not.
  Our main technical insight is a relation between the minimum number of
corrupt nodes required to hide all truthful nodes and a certain notion of
vertex separability for the underlying graph. Additionally, this insight lets
us design an efficient algorithm for a corrupt party to decide which graphs
require the fewest corrupted nodes, up to a multiplicative factor of $O(\log
n)$.

  Spatial Denoising Approach","34 pages",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the problem of measuring spatial and temporal variation
in driver productivity on ride-sourcing trips. This variation is especially
important from a driver's perspective: if a platform's drivers experience
systematic disparities in earnings because of variation in their riders'
destinations, they may perceive the pricing model as inequitable. This
perception can exacerbate search frictions if it leads drivers to avoid
locations where they believe they may be assigned ""unlucky"" fares. To
characterize any such systematic disparities in productivity, we develop an
analytic framework with three key components. First, we propose a productivity
metric that looks two consecutive trips ahead, thus capturing the effect on
expected earnings of market conditions at drivers' drop-off locations. Second,
we develop a natural experiment by analyzing trips with a common origin but
varying destinations, thus isolating purely spatial effects on productivity.
Third, we apply a spatial denoising method that allows us to work with raw
spatial information exhibiting high levels of noise and sparsity, without
having to aggregate data into large, low-resolution spatial zones. By applying
our framework to data on more than 1.4 million rides in Austin, Texas, we find
significant spatial variation in ride-sourcing driver productivity and search
frictions. Drivers at the same location experienced disparities in productivity
after being dispatched on trips with different destinations, with origin-based
surge pricing increasing these earnings disparities. Our results show that trip
distance is the dominant factor in driver productivity: short trips yielded
lower productivity, even when ending in areas with high demand. These findings
suggest that new pricing strategies are required to minimize random disparities
in driver earnings.

triangular pyramids-like Cu2O porous nanostructured films (PNFs) are studied by
heating treatments under different atmosphere and temperature. It is found that
the nanoscale building triangular-pyramids turn round preferentially at the
sharp angles and/or coalesce with their contacting ones by directional
diffusion and plastic flow of atoms, which are driven by the
nonuniformly-distributed surface nanocurvature. As a result, the triangular
pyramids become quasi-sphere shape and the PNF evolves into a big, dense
particles film. It is also observed that the heating or thermal activation
effect efficiently promotes the reduction or oxidation of Cu2O pyramids and the
crystallization or growth of the as-achieved Cu or CuO grains. The above
physical and chemical instabilities or changes at the nanoscale of Cu2O PNFs
can be well accounted for by the combined mechanism of nanocurvature effect and
thermal activation effect. The nanocurvature effect can lower the energy
barrier for the atom diffusion or plastic flow and lower the activation energy
for the chemical reactions, while the thermal activation effect can supply the
required kinetic energy or activation energy and make the atomic
transportations and reactions kinetically possible. The findings reveal the
evolution laws of morphology, crystal structure and composition of triangular
pyramids-like Cu2O PNF during heating treatments, which can further be extended

present a necessary and sufficient condition for edge-colored graphs (not
necessary to be proper) to have a $(g,f)$-chromatic spanning tree. Using this
criterion, I show that an edge-colored complete graph $G$ has a spanning tree
with a color probability distribution `similar' to that of $G$. Moreover, I
conjecture that an edge-colored complete graph $G$ of order $2n$ $(n \ge 3)$
can be partitioned into $n$ edge-disjoint spanning trees such that each has a
color probability distribution `similar' to that of $G$.

the database community and the programming language community, we are facing
difficulties to use views in practice. The main reason is that we lack ways to
directly describe view update strategies to deal with the inherent ambiguity of

controlling and sharing distributed data based on views, and establish a
software foundation for systematic construction of such data management
systems. Our key observation is that a view should be defined through a view
update strategy rather than a view definition. We show that Datalog can be used
for specifying view update strategies whose unique view definition can be
automatically derived, present a novel P2P-based programmable architecture for
distributed data management where updatable views are fully utilized for
controlling and sharing distributed data, and demonstrate its usefulness
through the development of a privacy-preserving ride-sharing alliance system.

comprised of range-shifted beamlets. The dosimeter response was simulated
according to an experimental quenching model. The beam model followed a
treatment planning system. The beam was decomposed into finely arranged
beamlets with weights estimated by deconvolution of longitudinal dosimeter
responses. The distributions of physical and biological doses were
reconstructed from the estimated weights, and were compared with the plan. We
also evaluated the sensitivity to measurement errors and to erratic delivery
with an undelivered beamlet. Results: The reconstructed physical and biological
doses accurately reproduced the simulated delivery with errors approximately
corresponding to the measurement errors. The erratic beam delivery was easily
detectable by comparison of biological dose distribution to the plan.
Conclusions: We have developed a method to measure physical and biological
doses by longitudinal dosimetry of quenched response without using plan data.
The method only involves a general optimization algorithm, a radiobiology
model, and experimental beamlet data, and requires no extra corrections.
Theoretically, this approach is applicable to various dosimeters and to proton

effectiveness.

system can simultaneously achieve decentralization, security, and performance
scalability. For current blockchain systems, as more nodes join the network,
the efficiency of the system (computation, communication, and storage) stays
constant at best. A leading idea for enabling blockchains to scale efficiency
is the notion of sharding: different subsets of nodes handle different portions
of the blockchain, thereby reducing the load for each individual node. However,
existing sharding proposals achieve efficiency scaling by compromising on trust
- corrupting the nodes in a given shard will lead to the permanent loss of the
corresponding portion of data. In this paper, we settle the trilemma by
demonstrating a new protocol for coded storage and computation in blockchains.
In particular, we propose PolyShard: ``polynomially coded sharding'' scheme
that achieves information-theoretic upper bounds on the efficiency of the
storage, system throughput, as well as on trust, thus enabling a truly scalable
system. We provide simulation results that numerically demonstrate the
performance improvement over state of the arts, and the scalability of the
PolyShard system. Finally, we discuss potential enhancements, and highlight
practical considerations in building such a system.

$\textsf{spanoid}$ (generalizing the notion of a matroid), which captures
well-studied problems in several areas. These include combinatorial geometry,
algebra (arrangements of hypersurfaces and ideals), statistical physics
(bootstrap percolation) and coding theory. We initiate a thorough investigation
of spanoids, from computational and structural viewpoints, focusing on
parameters relevant to the applications areas above and, in particular, to
questions regarding Locally Correctable Codes (LCCs).
  One central parameter we study is the $\textsf{rank}$ of a spanoid, extending
the rank of a matroid and related to the dimension of codes. This leads to one
main application of our work, establishing the first known barrier to improving
the nearly 20-year old bound of Katz-Trevisan (KT) on the dimension of LCCs. On
the one hand, we prove that the KT bound (and its more recent refinements)
holds for the much more general setting of spanoid rank. On the other hand we
show that there exist (random) spanoids whose rank matches these bounds. Thus,
to significantly improve the known bounds one must step out of the spanoid
framework.
  Another parameter we explore is the $\textsf{functional rank}$ of a spanoid,
which captures the possibility of turning a given spanoid into an actual code.
The question of the relationship between rank and functional rank is one of the
main questions we raise as it may reveal new avenues for constructing new LCCs
(perhaps even matching the KT bound). As a first step, we develop an entropy
relaxation of functional rank to create a small constant gap and amplify it by
tensoring to construct a spanoid whose functional rank is smaller than rank by
a polynomial factor. This is evidence that the entropy method we develop can
prove polynomially better bounds than KT-type methods on the dimension of LCCs.

learning: large, deep networks can generalize well, but existing theories
bounding generalization error are exceedingly loose, and thus cannot explain
this striking performance. Furthermore, a major hope is that knowledge may
transfer across tasks, so that multi-task learning can improve generalization
on individual tasks. However we lack analytic theories that can quantitatively
predict how the degree of knowledge transfer depends on the relationship
between the tasks. We develop an analytic theory of the nonlinear dynamics of
generalization in deep linear networks, both within and across tasks. In
particular, our theory provides analytic solutions to the training and testing
error of deep networks as a function of training time, number of examples,
network size and initialization, and the task structure and SNR. Our theory
reveals that deep networks progressively learn the most important task
structure first, so that generalization error at the early stopping time
primarily depends on task structure and is independent of network size. This
suggests any tight bound on generalization error must take into account task
structure, and explains observations about real data being learned faster than
random data. Intriguingly our theory also reveals the existence of a learning
algorithm that proveably out-performs neural network training through gradient
descent. Finally, for transfer learning, our theory reveals that knowledge
transfer depends sensitively, but computably, on the SNRs and input feature

rigidity and stability in Diophantine dynamics as well as their absence in

the Orion Trapezium Cluster with the recently comissioned GRAVITY instrument.
We observe a total of 16 stars of mainly OB spectral type. We find three
previously unknown companions for $\theta ^1$ Ori B, $\theta ^2$ Ori B, and
$\theta ^2$ Ori C. We determine a separation for the previously suspected
companion of NU Ori. We confirm four companions for $\theta ^1$ Ori A, $\theta
^1$ Ori C, $\theta ^1$ Ori D, and $\theta ^2$ Ori A, all with substantially
improved astrometry and photometric mass estimates. We refine the orbit of the
eccentric high-mass binary $\theta ^1$ Ori C and we are able to derive a new
orbit for $\theta ^1$ Ori D. We find a system mass of 21.7 $M_{\odot}$ and a
period of $53$ days. Together with other previously detected companions seen in
spectroscopy or direct imaging, eleven of the 16 high-mass stars are multiple
systems. We obtain a total number of 22 companions with separations up to 600
AU. The companion fraction of the early B and O stars in our sample is about 2,
significantly higher than in earlier studies of mostly OB associations. The
separation distribution hints towards a bimodality. Such a bimodality has been
previously found in A stars, but rarely in OB binaries, which up to this point
have been assumed to be mostly compact with a tail of wider companions. We also
do not find a substantial population of equal-mass binaries. The observed
distribution of mass ratios declines steeply with mass, and like the direct
star counts, indicates that our companions follow a standard power law initial
mass function. Again, this is in contrast to earlier findings of flat mass
ratio distributions in OB associations. We exclude collision as a dominant
formation mechanism but find no clear preference for core accretion or
competitive accretion.

get a complete analytic description of gauged solitons in (3+1) dimensions
living within a finite volume in terms of classic results in the theory of
differential equations and Kummer's con uent functions. We consider here two
types of gauged solitons: gauged Skyrmions and gauged time-crystals (namely,
gauged solitons periodic in time, whose time-period is protected by a winding
number). The dependence of the energy of the gauged Skyrmions on the Baryon
charge can be determined explicitly. The theory of Kummer's confluent functions
leads to a quantization condition for the period of the time-crystals.
Likewise, the theory of Sturm-Liouville operators gives rise to a quantization
condition for the volume occupied by the gauged Skyrmions. The present analysis
also discloses that resurgent techniques are very well suited to deal with the
gauged Skyrme model as well. In particular, we discuss a very nice relation
between the electromagnetic perturbations of the gauged Skyrmions and the
Mathieu equation which allows to use many of the modern resurgence techniques

methods to this end is evaluated mostly based on the Pearson correlation
coefficient between predicted and observed data, assuming that the upper bound
would be 1 (perfect correlation). However, the performance of these predictors
can be limited by the distribution and noise of the experimental data. Here we
estimate, for the first time, a theoretical upper-bound to the DDG prediction
performances imposed by the intrinsic structure of currently available DDG
data. Given a set of measured DDG protein variations, the theoretically best
predictor is estimated based on its similarity to another set of experimentally
determined DDG values. We investigate the correlation between pairs of measured
DDG variations, where one is used as a predictor for the other. We analytically
derive an upper bound to the Pearson correlation as a function of the noise and
distribution of the DDG data. We also evaluate the available datasets to
highlight the effect of the noise in conjunction with DDG distribution. We
conclude that the upper bound is a function of both uncertainty and spread of
the DDG values, and that with current data the best performance should be
between 0.7-0.8, depending on the dataset used; higher Pearson correlations
might be indicative of overtraining. It also follows that comparisons of

can emerge due to the breaking of inversion symmetry. This property is of both
fundamental and practical interest, in particular with a view to exploiting it
in low-power electronic devices. Advances towards technological applications
have been hindered, however, by the relatively low ordering temperatures
$T_\mathrm{spiral}$ of most magnetic spiral phases, which rarely exceed 100 K.
We have recently established that the ordering temperature of a magnetic spiral
can be increased up to 310 K by the introduction of chemical disorder. Here we
explore the design space opened up by this novel mechanism by combining it with
a targeted lattice control of some magnetic interactions. In Cu-Fe layered
perovskites we obtain $T_\mathrm{spiral}$ values close to 400 K, comfortably
far from room temperature and almost 100 K higher than using chemical disorder
alone. Moreover, we reveal a linear, universal relationship between the
spiral's wave vector and the onset temperature of the spiral phase. This linear
law ends at a paramagnetic-collinear-spiral triple point, which defines the
highest spiral ordering temperature that can be achieved in this class of
materials. Based on these findings, we propose a general set of rules for
designing magnetic spirals in layered perovskites using external pressure,
chemical substitutions and/or epitaxial strain, which should guide future
efforts to engineer magnetic spiral phases with ordering temperatures suitable
for technological applications.

electron-positron annihilation via plastic scintillators where photons interact
predominantly via Compton scattering. Registration of both primary and
scattered photons enables to determinate the linear polarization of the primary
photon on the event by event basis with a certain probability. Here we present
quantitative results on the feasibility of such polarization measurements of
photons from the decay of positronium with the J-PET and explore the physical
limitations for the resolution of the polarization determination of 511 keV
photons via Compton scattering. For scattering angles of about 82 deg (where
the best contrast for polarization measurement is theoretically predicted) we
find that the single event resolution for the determination of the polarization
is about 40 deg (predominantly due to properties of the Compton effect).
However, for samples larger than ten thousand events the J-PET is capable of
determining relative average polarization of these photons with the precision
of about few degrees. The obtained results open new perspectives for studies of
various physics phenomena such as quantum entanglement and tests of discrete
symmetries in decays of positronium and extend the energy range of polarization
measurements by five orders of magnitude beyond the optical wavelength regime.

cities, intelligent transportation system, customer behavior prediction, and
visual surveillance. Understanding the characteristics of the individual motion
in a crowd can be beneficial for social event detection and abnormal detection,
but it has rarely been studied. In this paper, we focus on the extraversion
measure of individual motions in crowds based on trajectory data. Extraversion
is one of typical personalities that is often observed in human crowd behaviors
and it can reflect not only the characteristics of the individual motion, but
also the that of the holistic crowd motions. To our best knowledge, this is the
first attempt to analyze individual extraversion of crowd motions based on
trajectories. To accomplish this, we first present a effective composite motion
descriptor, which integrates the basic individual motion information and social
metrics, to describe the extraversion of each individual in a crowd. The social
metrics consider both the neighboring distribution and their interaction
pattern. Since our major goal is to learn a universal scoring function that can
measure the degrees of extraversion across varied crowd scenes, we incorporate
and adapt the active learning technique to the relative attribute approach.
Specifically, we assume the social groups in any crowds contain individuals
with the similar degree of extraversion. Based on such assumption, we
significantly reduce the computation cost by clustering and ranking the
trajectories actively. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our proposed
method by measuring the degree of extraversion for real individual trajectories
in crowds and analyzing crowd scenes from a real-world dataset.

  Information from Multi-Source Medical Data","Accepted as CIKM2019 long paper",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge Graph (KG) contains entities and the relations between entities.
Due to its representation ability, KG has been successfully applied to support
many medical/healthcare tasks. However, in the medical domain, knowledge holds
under certain conditions. For example, symptom \emph{runny nose} highly
indicates the existence of disease \emph{whooping cough} when the patient is a
baby rather than the people at other ages. Such conditions for medical
knowledge are crucial for decision-making in various medical applications,
which is missing in existing medical KGs. In this paper, we aim to discovery
medical knowledge conditions from texts to enrich KGs.
  Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are systematized collection of clinical
data and contain detailed information about patients, thus EMRs can be a good
resource to discover medical knowledge conditions. Unfortunately, the amount of
available EMRs is limited due to reasons such as regularization. Meanwhile, a
large amount of medical question answering (QA) data is available, which can
greatly help the studied task. However, the quality of medical QA data is quite
diverse, which may degrade the quality of the discovered medical knowledge
conditions. In the light of these challenges, we propose a new truth discovery
method, MedTruth, for medical knowledge condition discovery, which incorporates
prior source quality information into the source reliability estimation
procedure, and also utilizes the knowledge triple information for trustworthy
information computation. We conduct series of experiments on real-world medical
datasets to demonstrate that the proposed method can discover meaningful and
accurate conditions for medical knowledge by leveraging both EMR and QA data.
Further, the proposed method is tested on synthetic datasets to validate its
effectiveness under various scenarios.

unfortunate trans-Planckian problem --- a Hawking photon near spatial infinity,
if back-tracked to the immediate vicinity of the horizon is hugely blue-shifted
and found to have had trans-Planckian energy. (And if back-tracked all the way
to the horizon, the photon is formally infinitely blue-shifted, and formally
acquires infinite energy.) Unruh has forcefully argued that this implies that
the Hawking flux represents a vacuum instability in the presence of a horizon,
and that the Hawking photons are actually emitted from some region exterior to
the horizon. We seek to make this idea more precise and somewhat explicit by
building a purely kinematical model for Hawking evaporation based on two Vaidya
spacetimes (outer and inner) joined across a thin time-like boundary layer. The
kinematics of this model is already quite rich, and we shall defer
consideration of the dynamics for subsequent work. In particular we shall
present an explicit calculation of the the 4-acceleration of the shell
(including the effects of gravity, motion, and the outgoing null flux) and
relate this 4-acceleration to the Unruh temperature.

vector-valued observables. In contrast to the scalar-valued observables
examined previously, this multidimensional thermodynamic uncertainty relation
provides a natural way to study currents in high-dimensional systems and to
obtain relations between different observables. Our proof is based on the
generalized Cr{\'a}mer-Rao inequality, which we interpret as a relation between
physical observables and the Fisher information. This allows us to develop
high-dimensional versions of both the original, steady state uncertainty
relation and the more recently obtained generalized uncertainty relation for
time-periodic systems. We apply the multidimensional uncertainty relation to
obtain a new constraint on the performance of steady-state heat engines, which
is tighter than previous bounds and reveals the role of heat-work correlations.
As a second application, we show that the uncertainty relation is connected to
a bound on the differential mobility. As a result of this connection, we find
that a necessary condition for equality in the uncertainty relation is that the
system obeys the equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation.

frequency of occurred event---is missing. An alternative approach is therefore
considered where the quasiprobability operationally reveals the negativity of

theoretical framework for determining completely which events do and do not
happen in evolving quantum, or indeed classical, systems. The theory is
observer-independent and constructed from discrete histories, making the
framework a potential setting for discrete quantum cosmology and quantum
gravity, as well as ordinary discrete quantum systems. The foundation of this
theory is Quantum Measure Theory, which generalises (classical) measure theory
to allow for quantum interference between alternative histories; and its
co-event interpretation, which describes whether events can or can not occur,
and in what combination, given a system and a quantum measure. In contrast to
previous co-event schemes, the evolving co-event scheme is applied in stages,
in the stochastic sense, without any dependence on later stages, making it
manifestly compatible with an evolving block view. It is shown that the
co-event realities produced by the basic evolving scheme do not depend on the
inclusion or exclusion of zero measure histories in the history space, which
follows non-trivially from the basic rules of the scheme. It is also shown that
this evolving co-event scheme will reduce to producing classical realities when
it is applied to classical systems.

the equilibrium Model B for diffusive phase separation of a scalar field, by
adding leading-order terms that break time-reversal symmetry. It was recently
shown that such active terms can cause the bulk phase separation of Model B to
be replaced by a steady state of microphase separation at a finite length
scale. This phenomenon was understood at mean-field level as due to the
activity-induced reversal of the Ostwald ripening mechanism, which provides the
kinetic pathway to bulk phase separation in passive fluids. This reversal
occurs only in certain ranges for the activity parameters. In this paper we go
beyond such a mean-field analysis and develop a $1$-loop Renormalisation Group
(RG) approach. We first show that, in the parameter range where bulk phase
separation is still present, the critical point belongs formally to the same
(Wilson-Fisher) universality class as the passive Model B. In contrast, in a
parameter range associated with microphase separation, we find that an unstable
non-equilibrium fixed point of the RG flow arises for $d\geq 2$, colliding with
the Wilson-Fisher point in $d\to 2^+$ and making it unstable in $d=2$. At large
activity, the flow in this region is towards strong coupling. We argue that the
phase transition to microphase separation in active systems, in the physically
relevant dimensions $d=2$ and $3$, very probably belongs to a new
non-equilibrium universality class. Because it is governed by the
strong-coupling regime of the RG flow, our perturbative analysis leaves open
the quantitative characterization of this new class.

intends to expand the applicability of 5th generation New Radio access
technology to support operation in unlicensed bands by adhering to
Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) requirements for accessing the channel. LBT was
already adopted by different variants of 4th generation Long Term Evolution
(LTE) in unlicensed spectrum, i.e., Licensed-Assisted Access and MulteFire, to
guarantee fair coexistence among different radio access technologies. In the
case of beam-based transmissions, the NR-U coexistence framework is
significantly different as compared to LTE in unlicensed spectrum due to the
use of directional antennas, which enhance the spatial reuse but also
complicate the interference management. In particular, beam-based transmissions
are needed in the unlicensed spectrum at millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands, which
is an attractive candidate for NR-U due to its large amount of allocated
spectrum. As a consequence, some major design principles need to be revisited
to address coexistence for beam-based NR-U. In this paper, different problems
and the potential solutions related to channel access procedures, frame
structure, initial access procedures, re-transmission procedures, and
scheduling schemes are discussed. A simulation evaluation of different

of reconstruction with fewer rays. In vector and tensor problems it holds the
promise of reconstruction of images that are in the null space of related

moments of the distribution are the x-ray transform of powers of the unknown

$\gamma\indices{^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}}$ and their respective conjugate momenta,

multiplexing multiple views on a single image sensor. However, the high angular
resolution is achieved at the expense of reducing the spatial resolution of
each view by orders of magnitude compared to the raw sensor image. While light
field super-resolution is still at an early stage, the field of single image
super-resolution (SISR) has recently known significant advances with the use of
deep learning techniques. This paper describes a simple framework allowing us
to leverage state-of-the-art SISR techniques into light fields, while taking
into account specific light field geometrical constraints. The idea is to first
compute a representation compacting most of the light field energy into as few
components as possible. This is achieved by aligning the light field using
optical flows and then by decomposing the aligned light field using singular
value decomposition (SVD). The principal basis captures the information that is
coherent across all the views, while the other basis contain the high angular
frequencies. Super-resolving this principal basis using an SISR method allows
us to super-resolve all the information that is coherent across the entire
light field. This framework allows the proposed light field super-resolution
method to inherit the benefits of the SISR method used. Experimental results
show that the proposed method is competitive, and most of the time superior, to
recent light field super-resolution methods in terms of both PSNR and SSIM
quality metrics, with a lower complexity.

advisors' trustworthiness and advice reliability. Specifically, these processes
are hypothesized to be particularly important in situations where objective
feedback is absent or difficult to acquire. Here, we use a judge-advisor system
paradigm to precisely manipulate the profiles of virtual advisors whose
opinions are provided to participants performing a perceptual decision making
task. We find that when advisors' and participants' judgments are independent,
people are able to discriminate subtle advice features, like confidence
calibration, whether or not objective feedback is available. However, when
observers' judgments (and judgment errors) are correlated - as is the case in
many social contexts - predictable distortions can be observed between feedback
and feedback-free scenarios. A simple model of advice reliability estimation,
endowed with metacognitive insight, is able to explain key patterns of results
observed in the human data. We use agent-based modeling to explore implications
of these individual-level decision strategies for network-level patterns of
trust and belief formation.

the future fifth generation (5G) wireless communication system. In mMTC, the
information processing at the sensor nodes is required to be simple, low power
consuming and spectral efficient. In order to increase the spectral efficiency
at the cost of minimum performance loss and to simplify the information
processing at the sensor node, in this paper a codebook based spreading
technique is proposed. In the proposed scheme, first, the modulation and
spreading are combined into a direct symbol-to-sequence spreader, which
directly maps the input bits into a codeword from the user specific codebook.
Secondly, utilizing the sporadic node activity of the mMTC a compressive
sensing based algorithm is designed for multiuser activity and data detection.
Exploiting the multidimensional structure of the codebook, the required signal
to noise ratio (SNR) to increase the modulation order, is reduced as compared
to the conventional scheme. Besides reducing the power consumption, it is shown
that for modulation order of eight, the proposed scheme achieves a gain of 1 dB
over the conventional scheme at bit error rate (BER) of 10^-5. However, more
sophisticated decoding algorithm is required to achieve the performance gain at
a lower modulation order.

entangled SE states relevant to quantum metrology, we demonstrate that under
the decoherence of S, redundant information is imprinted onto E, giving rise to
classical objectivity - a consensus of the nuclear spins about the state of S.
This provides the first laboratory verification of the objective classical

Together with insights from adiabatic elimination and kinetic Monte Carlo, we
identify three dynamical regimes. For initial times, their evolution is
dominated by the system unitary dynamics and depends on the initial state and
the Hamiltonian parameters. For weak spin-spin interaction anisotropy, after
this initial dynamical regime, two-time correlations enter an algebraic scaling
regime signaling the breakdown of time-translation invariance and the emergence
of aging. For stronger interaction anisotropy, these correlations first go
through a stretched exponential regime before entering the algebraic one. Such
complex relaxation arises due to the competition between the proliferation
dynamics of energetically costly excitations and their motion. As a result,
dissipative heating dynamics of spin systems can be used to probe the entire

multipole moments of a compact binary system, known in terms of symmetric and

compact binaries within the post-Newtonian (PN) formalism. For nonspinning
compact binaries, we derive the gravitational wave phasing formula, in the
frequency domain, parametrizing each PN order term in terms of the multipole
moments which contribute to that order. Using GW observations, this
{\it{parametrized multipolar phasing}} would allow us to derive the bounds on
possible departures from the multipole structure of GR and hence constrain the
parameter space of alternative theories of gravity. We compute the projected
accuracies with which the second generation ground-based detectors, such as
Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), the third
generation detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, as well as

measure the first two or three multipole coefficients with good accuracy,
Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope may be able to measure the first four
multipole coefficients which enter the phasing formula. Intermediate mass ratio
inspirals, with mass ratio of several tens, in the frequency band of planned
space-based LISA mission should be able to measure all the seven multipole
coefficients which appear in the 3.5PN phasing formula. Our finding highlights
the importance of this class of sources for probing the strong-field gravity

radius, finding that its motions between 130 AU and 60 AU are partially fitted
with a Keplerian orbit by a stellar object of $\sim0.30 ~\rm\,M_\odot$, while
the motions within 60 AU do not follow any Keplerian orbit at all. This makes
it difficult to lead a reliable estimation of the mass of L328-IRS.
Nonetheless, our ALMA observations were useful enough to well constrain the
inclination angle of the outflow cavity of L328-IRS as $\sim 66^{\circ}$,
enabling us to better determine the mass accretion rate of $\sim 8.9\times

L328-IRS is mostly due to this mass accretion process in the disk, or that
L328-IRS has mostly accumulated the mass through this constant accretion rate

leave our identification of L328-IRS as a proto-brown dwarf to be tentative

and a low-rank promoting term have important applications in machine learning
and signal processing, such as when one wishes to recover an unknown matrix
that is simultaneously low-rank and sparse. However, such problems are highly
challenging to solve in large-scale: the low-rank promoting term prohibits
efficient implementations of proximal methods for composite optimization and
even simple subgradient methods. On the other hand, methods which are tailored
for low-rank optimization, such as conditional gradient-type methods, which are
often applied to a smooth approximation of the nonsmooth objective, are slow
since their runtime scales with both the large Lipshitz parameter of the
smoothed gradient vector and with $1/\epsilon$. In this paper we develop
efficient algorithms for \textit{stochastic} optimization of a strongly-convex
objective which includes both a nonsmooth term and a low-rank promoting term.
In particular, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first algorithm
that enjoys all following critical properties for large-scale problems: i)
(nearly) optimal sample complexity, ii) each iteration requires only a single
\textit{low-rank} SVD computation, and iii) overall number of thin-SVD
computations scales only with $\log{1/\epsilon}$ (as opposed to
$\textrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ in previous methods). We also give an algorithm for
the closely-related finite-sum setting. At the heart of our results lie a novel
combination of a variance-reduction technique and the use of a
\textit{weak-proximal oracle} which is key to obtaining all above three
properties simultaneously.

the total magnetic field (gaps) and/or the electric field may exceed the value

the emission. If only one star is magnetized (1M-DNS scenario) the emission is
likely to be produced along the direction of the magnetic field at the location
of the secondary; then, if the magnetic axis is misaligned with the orbital
spin, this direction is modulated on the orbital period. For the 2M-DNS

reach, even for surrogate-based approaches: the proposed solutions are
sub-optimal or do not cover the front well. As non-compromising optimal
solutions have usually little point in applications, this work restricts the
search to solutions that are close to the Pareto front center. The article
starts by characterizing this center, which is defined for any type of front.
Next, a Bayesian multi-objective optimization method for directing the search
towards it is proposed. Targeting a subset of the Pareto front allows an
improved optimality of the solutions and a better coverage of this zone, which
is our main concern. A criterion for detecting convergence to the center is
described. If the criterion is triggered, a widened central part of the Pareto
front is targeted such that sufficiently accurate convergence to it is
forecasted within the remaining budget. Numerical experiments show how the
resulting algorithm, C-EHI, better locates the central part of the Pareto front
when compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian algorithms.

waves, which is analogous to an oscillating charge generating electromagnetic

Solving the equations of spin dynamics, we calculate the energy dissipation
caused by spin wave radiation for arbitrary tipping angles of the magnetization
and directions of the magnetic field, and for both vortex types of $^3$He-B.
For the double-core vortex we also consider the anisotropy of the radiation and
the dependence of the dissipation on twisting of the half cores. The radiated
energy is compared with experiments in the mid-temperature range $T \sim 0.5
T_c$. The dependence of the calculated dissipation on several parameters is in
good agreement with the experiments. Combined with numerically calculated

Such the stress drop is caused by restructuring of the contact networks,
accompanied by drastic changes of the interaction forces. The changes of the
forces happen heterogeneously in space, indicating that collective non-affine
motions of the disks are most pronounced when slip-avalanches occur. We analyze

in the regret minimization framework. For this problem, all existing regret
minimization algorithms for the fully-adversarial setting are based on a
positive semidefinite convex relaxation, and hence require quadratic memory and
SVD computation (either thin of full) on each iteration, which amounts to at
least quadratic runtime per iteration. This is in stark contrast to a
corresponding stochastic i.i.d. variant of the problem, which was studied
extensively lately, and admits very efficient gradient ascent algorithms that
work directly on the natural non-convex formulation of the problem, and hence
require only linear memory and linear runtime per iteration. This raises the
question: can non-convex online gradient ascent algorithms be shown to minimize
regret in online adversarial settings? In this paper we take a step forward
towards answering this question. We introduce an
\textit{adversarially-perturbed spiked-covariance model} in which, each data
point is assumed to follow a fixed stochastic distribution with a non-zero
spectral gap in the covariance matrix, but is then perturbed with some
adversarial vector. This model is a natural extension of a well studied
standard stochastic setting that allows for non-stationary (adversarial)
patterns to arise in the data and hence, might serve as a significantly better
approximation for real-world data-streams. We show that in an interesting
regime of parameters, when the non-convex online gradient ascent algorithm is
initialized with a ""warm-start"" vector, it provably minimizes the regret with
high probability. We further discuss the possibility of computing such a
""warm-start"" vector, and also the use of regularization to obtain fast regret
rates. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical experiments on both

perform simulations, artificially reducing the initial angular velocity of the

torus for the rapidly rotating model by considering the viscous and
recombination effects and show that if the energy of $\sim 10^{52}$ erg is
injected from the torus to the envelope, the luminosity and timescale of the

towards systematically studying V1 computations by categorizing neurons into
groups that perform similar computations. We present a framework to identify
common features independent of individual neurons' orientation selectivity by
using a rotation-equivariant convolutional neural network, which automatically
extracts every feature at multiple different orientations. We fit this model to
responses of a population of 6000 neurons to natural images recorded in mouse
primary visual cortex using two-photon imaging. We show that our
rotation-equivariant network not only outperforms a regular CNN with the same
number of feature maps, but also reveals a number of common features shared by
many V1 neurons, which deviate from the typical textbook idea of V1 as a bank
of Gabor filters. Our findings are a first step towards a powerful new tool to

Several families of communication-reduction methods, such as quantization,
large-batch methods, and gradient sparsification, have been proposed. To date,
gradient sparsification methods - where each node sorts gradients by magnitude,
and only communicates a subset of the components, accumulating the rest locally
- are known to yield some of the largest practical gains. Such methods can
reduce the amount of communication per step by up to three orders of magnitude,
while preserving model accuracy. Yet, this family of methods currently has no
theoretical justification.
  This is the question we address in this paper. We prove that, under analytic
assumptions, sparsifying gradients by magnitude with local error correction
provides convergence guarantees, for both convex and non-convex smooth
objectives, for data-parallel SGD. The main insight is that sparsification
methods implicitly maintain bounds on the maximum impact of stale updates,
thanks to selection by magnitude. Our analysis and empirical validation also
reveal that these methods do require analytical conditions to converge well,
justifying existing heuristics.

in the formation of molecules, like formaldehyde, methanol, and complex organic
molecules (COMs). These species form through the sequential hydrogenation of CO
ice. Although molecular hydrogen (H2) abundances can be four orders of
magnitude higher than those of free H-atoms in dense clouds, H2 surface
chemistry has been largely ignored; several laboratory studies show that H2
does not actively participate in non-energetic ice chemistry because of the
high activation energies required. Aims. For the example of CO ice
hydrogenation, we experimentally investigated the potential role of H2
molecules on the surface chemistry when energetic processing (i.e., UV
photolysis) is involved. We test whether additional hydrogenation pathways
become available upon UV irradiation of a CO:H2 ice mixture and whether this
reaction mechanism also applies to other chemical systems. Methods. Ultra-high
vacuum (UHV) experiments were performed at 8~20 K. A pre-deposited solid
mixture of CO:H2 was irradiated with UV-photons. Reflection absorption infrared
spectroscopy (RAIRS) was used as an in situ diagnostic tool. Single reaction
steps and possible isotopic effects were studied by comparing results from
CO:H2 and CO:D2 ice mixtures. Results. After UV-irradiation of a CO:H2 ice
mixture, two photon-induced products, HCO and H2CO, are unambiguously detected.
The proposed reaction mechanism involves electronically excited CO in the
following reaction steps: CO + h{\nu}->CO*, CO* + H2->HCO + H where newly
formed H-atoms are then available for further hydrogenation reactions. The HCO
formation yields have a strong temperature dependence for the investigated
regime, which is most likely linked to the H2 sticking coefficient. Finally,
the astronomical relevance of this photo-induced reaction channel is discussed.

it increases as hole-doping increases. The Fe-3d$_{xy}$ (xy) orbital is much

star formation processes over cosmological timescales. Magnesium has three
stable isotopes, 24Mg, 25Mg, 26Mg, which can be produced both in massive and
intermediate-mass (IM) stars with masses between 2 and 8 M_\odot. In this work,
we use constraints on the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and explore
the role and mass range of intermediate mass stars using the observed isotopic
ratios. We compare several models of stellar nucleosynthesis with
metallicity-dependent yields and also consider the effect of rotation on the
yields massive stars and its consequences on the evolution of the Mg isotopes.
We use a cosmic evolution model updated with new observational SFRD data and
new reionization constraints coming from 2018 Planck collaboration
determinations. We find that the main contribution of 24Mg comes from massive
stars whereas 25Mg and 26Mg come from intermediate mass stars. To fit the
observational data on magnesium isotopic ratios, an additional intermediate
mass SFRD component is preferred. Moreover, the agreement between model and
data is further improved when the range of IM masses is narrowed towards higher
masses (5-8 M_\odot). While some rotation also improves the fit to data, we can
exclude the case where all stars have high rotational velocities due to an
over-production of 26Mg.

behavior of the system by screening the drain. Dissipation leads to two types
of fluctuations. First, fluctuations are generated by particles emitted in the
reservoir. Both above and below the critical loss, these result in thermal
emission of phonons with a temperature set by the loss rate and the chemical
potential. The second type of fluctuation results from scattering on the drain
and gives rise to a particular correlation pattern that can be observed in the
density-density correlation. Aside from correlations between in an out
scattered modes, outgoing particles are correlated with localized modes through
a process that is reminiscent of Hawking radiation. Finally, we briefly discuss
the dynamics of the system when there are two drains, in which case it is
possible to construct a black hole laser.

the Hamiltonian action, or equivalently in the number of quanta (phonons) of
the motion linearized about the zero of the potential. At the presence of
additional stray electric fields, the ion is pushed from the origin of the
potential and set into a large-amplitude driven oscillation, and above a
threshold amplitude of such ""excess micromotion"", the action distribution of
excitations about the driven oscillation broadens and becomes distinctly

that of the Doppler cooling limit. We derive a relation allowing to deduce just
from the experimentally observable photon scattering rate both the required
detuning for optimal cooling and the final mean phonon number. These results
are important for quantum information processing and other applications, and in

supersymmetry enhancement at their IR fixed point, thereby giving a Lagrangian
description for a plethora of Argyres-Douglas theories. A generic feature of
these Lagrangians is that a number of gauge invariant operators decouple (as
free fields) along the RG-flow. These decoupled operators can be naturally
taken into account from the beginning itself by introducing additional gauge
singlets (sometimes called `flipping fields') that couple to the decoupled
operators via appropriate superpotential terms. It has also been checked that
upon dimensionally reducing to 3d, the $(A_1,A_{2n-1})$ type Lagrangians only
produce the expected behavior when flipping fields are included in the
Lagrangian. In this paper we further investigate the role of flipping fields
and find an example where the expected necessity of including the flipping
fields in the dimensionally reduced Lagrangians seems to get violated. In the
process we find two new dual Lagrangians for the so called 3d $T[SU(2)]$
theory.

network weights. The emergent bulk metric is found to have both a black hole

In fact, a quark antiquark potential holographically calculated by the emergent

conclusion is supported by the behavior of the degrees of polarization of the

(MZMs) due to the absence of smoking-gun signatures in charge transport
measurements. Recent studies suggest that the spin degree of freedom of MZMs
may provide an alternative detection method. We study the spin properties of
the superconducting state in Majorana nanowires and the associated
unconventional Josephson effect with realistic experimental parameters taken
from [Zhang {\it et al.}, Nature 556, 74 (2018)]. For a superconducting thin
film with in-plane polarized spin-triplet pairing, an out-of-plane electric
field can generate a supercurrent perpendicular to both the superconducting
spin polarization and the electric field, so we name this phenomena as
superconducting anomalous Hall effect (ScAHE). In a Majorana nanowire, the
regime with finite polarized spin-triplet pairing almost coincides with the
chiral regime, which includes the topological regime. We further study the
effects of polarized spin-triplet pairing in two types of Josephson junctions.
One dramatic finding is that SOC can induce an anomalous supercurrent at zero
phase difference only in the U-shape junction, a basic ingredient of scalable
topological quantum computation. This can be viewed as a consequence of the
ScAHE. Our work reveals that the spin degree of freedom is indeed helpful for
detecting MZMs.

compact active zone of $42\times42\times35\textrm{cm}^3$ and operating on the
highly enriched uranium-235 at 90 MW thermal power. We report the results of
the Neutrino-4 experiment of measurements of reactor antineutrino flux and
spectrum dependence on the distance in the range 6-12 meters from the center of
the reactor core. Using the measured spectrum and the distance dependence of
antineutrino flux, we performed the model independent analysis of restrictions
on the oscillation parameters $\Delta m^2_{14}$ and $\sin^2 2\theta_{14}$. The
method of coherent addition of results of measurements is proposed. It allows
us to directly observe the effect of oscillations. We observed the oscillation
effect at CL $3.5\sigma$ in the vicinity of $\Delta m^2_{14} \approx
7.26\textrm{eV}^2$ and $\sin^2 2\theta_{14} \approx 0.38$. Combining the result
of the Neutrino-4 experiment and the result of the gallium anomaly effect we
obtained value $\sin^2 2\theta_{14} \approx 0.35 \pm 0.07 (5\sigma)$. The
analysis of systematics effects is presented. Comparison with results of other

necessary to notice that obtained values $\sin^2 2\theta_{14} \approx 0.35 \pm

potential performance than conventional active learning methods in which only
one criterion is deployed for sample selection. A central issue related to
MQCAL methods concerns the development of an integration criteria strategy
(ICS) that makes full use of all criteria. The conventional ICS adopted in
relevant research all facilitate the desired effects, but several limitations
still must be addressed. For instance, some of the strategies are not
sufficiently scalable during the design process, and the number and type of
criteria involved are dictated. Thus, it is challenging for the user to
integrate other criteria into the original process unless modifications are
made to the algorithm. Other strategies are too dependent on empirical
parameters, which can only be acquired by experience or cross-validation and
thus lack generality; additionally, these strategies are counter to the
intention of active learning, as samples need to be labeled in the validation
set before the active learning process can begin. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel MQCAL method for classification tasks that employs a third
strategy via weighted rank aggregation. The proposed method serves as a
heuristic means to select high-value samples of high scalability and generality
and is implemented through a three-step process: (1) the transformation of the
sample selection to sample ranking and scoring, (2) the computation of the
self-adaptive weights of each criterion, and (3) the weighted aggregation of
each sample rank list. Ultimately, the sample at the top of the aggregated
ranking list is the most comprehensively valuable and must be labeled. Several
experiments generating 257 wins, 194 ties and 49 losses against other
state-of-the-art MQCALs are conducted to verify that the proposed method can
achieve superior results.

spatial modulation of the electron-energy distribution reflects the phase

  self-similarity learning, super-resolution",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-similarity learning has been recognized as a promising method for single
image super-resolution (SR) to produce high-resolution (HR) image in recent
years. The performance of learning based SR reconstruction, however, highly
depends on learned representation coeffcients. Due to the degradation of input
image, conventional sparse coding is prone to produce unfaithful representation
coeffcients. To this end, we propose a novel kernel based low-rank sparse model
with self-similarity learning for single image SR which incorporates
nonlocalsimilarity prior to enforce similar patches having similar
representation weights. We perform a gradual magnification scheme, using
self-examples extracted from the degraded input image and up-scaled versions.
To exploit nonlocal-similarity, we concatenate the vectorized input patch and
its nonlocal neighbors at different locations into a data matrix which consists
of similar components. Then we map the nonlocal data matrix into a
high-dimensional feature space by kernel method to capture their nonlinear
structures. Under the assumption that the sparse coeffcients for the nonlocal
data in the kernel space should be low-rank, we impose low-rank constraint on
sparse coding to share similarities among representation coeffcients and remove
outliers in order that stable weights for SR reconstruction can be obtained.
Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method in both
visual quality and reconstruction error.

for exact and heuristic methods, and some cases with as few as 18 cargoes

set-partitioning phase and uses problem-tailored variation operators to
efficiently handle all the problem characteristics. As shown in our
experimental analyses, the B&P optimally solves 239/240 existing instances

that it can optimally solve problems with around 60 ships and 200 cargoes

trivial modification of the field space geometry of the scalar sector, which
allows for inflationary phase that begins at the conformal point of the
inflaton $\psi$, i.e. $\langle\psi\rangle=0$. Since the model is Weyl
invariant, the inflaton condensation models a process of spontaneous Weyl
symmetry breaking. For a wide range of parameters the spectral observables of
the model are in good agreement with the CMB measurements, such that the scalar
spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio approximately agree with those of
Starobinsky's inflation, i.e. $n_s\simeq 0.96-0.97$ and $r \approx 3\times
10^{-3}$. The simplest version of our model contains two scalar degrees of
freedom, one of them being an exactly flat direction. If that degree is excited
early on in inflation and if inflation lasts for about 60 e-foldings, we find
that the Unverse undergoes a short period of kination that predates inflation.
Such a period strongly suppresses the amplitude of large scale CMB temperature

tomography (OCT) B-scans of the optic nerve head (ONH).
  Methods: Volume scans consisting of 97 horizontal B-scans were acquired
through the center of the ONH using a commercial OCT device (Spectralis) for
both eyes of 20 subjects. For each eye, single-frame (without signal
averaging), and multi-frame (75x signal averaging) volume scans were obtained.
A custom deep learning network was then designed and trained with 2,328 ""clean
B-scans"" (multi-frame B-scans), and their corresponding ""noisy B-scans"" (clean
B-scans + gaussian noise) to de-noise the single-frame B-scans. The performance
of the de-noising algorithm was assessed qualitatively, and quantitatively on
1,552 B-scans using the signal to noise ratio (SNR), contrast to noise ratio
(CNR), and mean structural similarity index metrics (MSSIM).
  Results: The proposed algorithm successfully denoised unseen single-frame OCT
B-scans. The denoised B-scans were qualitatively similar to their corresponding
multi-frame B-scans, with enhanced visibility of the ONH tissues. The mean SNR
increased from $4.02 \pm 0.68$ dB (single-frame) to $8.14 \pm 1.03$ dB
(denoised). For all the ONH tissues, the mean CNR increased from $3.50 \pm
0.56$ (single-frame) to $7.63 \pm 1.81$ (denoised). The MSSIM increased from
$0.13 \pm 0.02$ (single frame) to $0.65 \pm 0.03$ (denoised) when compared with
the corresponding multi-frame B-scans.
  Conclusions: Our deep learning algorithm can denoise a single-frame OCT
B-scan of the ONH in under 20 ms, thus offering a framework to obtain superior
quality OCT B-scans with reduced scanning times and minimal patient discomfort.

factorization (nsNMF), and support vector machine (SVM) to utilize the full
range of sequencing data, aiming at better aggregating genetic mutations and
improving their power in predicting cancer types. Specifically, we introduced a
classifier to distinguish cancer types using somatic mutations obtained from
whole-exome sequencing data. Mutations were identified from multiple cancers
and scored using SIFT, PP2, and CADD, and grouped at the individual gene level.
The nsNMF was then applied to reduce dimensionality and to obtain coefficient
and basis matrices. A feature matrix was derived from the obtained matrices to
train a classifier for cancer type classification with the SVM model. We have
demonstrated that the classifier was able to distinguish the cancer types with
reasonable accuracy. In five-fold cross-validations using mutation counts as
features, the average prediction accuracy was 77.1% (SEM=0.1%), significantly
outperforming baselines and outperforming models using mutation scores as
features. Using the factor matrices derived from the nsNMF, we identified
multiple genes and pathways that are significantly associated with each cancer

associations between somatic mutations and cancers. The discovered genes and
pathways associated with each cancer type can lead to biological insights. The

a low-lying reduced Hamiltonian for a relevant subspace of states,
incorporating effects of its coupling to states with much higher energy.
Suppose this powerful elimination approach is applied to quasi-energy states in
periodically-driven systems, a critical question then arises that the violation
of the adiabatic condition caused by driven forces challenges such a presence
of spectral reduction in the non-equilibrium driven system. Here, both
theoretically and experimentally, we newly reported two kinds of driven-induced
eliminations universal in topologically-protected Floquet systems. We named
them ""quasi-adiabatic elimination"" and ""high-frequency-limited elimination"", in
terms of different driven frequencies that deny the underlying requirement for
the adiabatic condition. Both two non-adiabatic eliminations are observed in
our recently developed microwave Floquet simulator, a programmable test
platform composed of periodically-bending ultrathin metallic coupled corrugated
waveguides. Through the near-field imaging on our simulator, the mechanisms
between the adiabatic and driven-induced eliminations are revealed, indicating
the ubiquitous spectral decomposition for tailoring and manipulating Floquet
states with quasi-energies. Finally, we hope our findings may open up profound

Discovering sequences with desired properties has long been an interesting
intellectual pursuit. This paper puts forth a new paradigm, AlphaSeq, to
discover desired sequences algorithmically using deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) techniques. AlphaSeq treats the sequence discovery problem as an episodic
symbol-filling game, in which a player fills symbols in the vacant positions of
a sequence set sequentially during an episode of the game. Each episode ends
with a completely-filled sequence set, upon which a reward is given based on
the desirability of the sequence set. AlphaSeq models the game as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP), and adapts the DRL framework of AlphaGo to solve the
MDP. Sequences discovered improve progressively as AlphaSeq, starting as a
novice, learns to become an expert game player through many episodes of game
playing. Compared with traditional sequence construction by mathematical tools,
AlphaSeq is particularly suitable for problems with complex objectives
intractable to mathematical analysis. We demonstrate the searching capabilities
of AlphaSeq in two applications: 1) AlphaSeq successfully rediscovers a set of
ideal complementary codes that can zero-force all potential interferences in
multi-carrier CDMA systems. 2) AlphaSeq discovers new sequences that triple the
signal-to-interference ratio -- benchmarked against the well-known Legendre
sequence -- of a mismatched filter estimator in pulse compression radar

necessary texture and motion representations for ingestion and analysis by
spatio-temporal deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, when
considering visual Internet-of-Things applications, surveillance systems and
semantic crawlers of large video repositories, the video capture and the
CNN-based semantic analysis parts do not tend to be co-located. This
necessitates the transport of compressed video over networks and incurs
significant overhead in bandwidth and energy consumption, thereby significantly
undermining the deployment potential of such systems. In this paper, we
investigate the trade-off between the encoding bitrate and the achievable
accuracy of CNN-based video classification models that directly ingest
AVC/H.264 and HEVC encoded videos. Instead of retaining entire compressed video
bitstreams and applying complex optical flow calculations prior to CNN
processing, we only retain motion vector and select texture information at
significantly-reduced bitrates and apply no additional processing prior to CNN
ingestion. Based on three CNN architectures and two action recognition
datasets, we achieve 11%-94% saving in bitrate with marginal effect on
classification accuracy. A model-based selection between multiple CNNs
increases these savings further, to the point where, if up to 7% loss of
accuracy can be tolerated, video classification can take place with as little
as 3 kbps for the transport of the required compressed video information to the
system implementing the CNN models.

  with Intrinsic Similarity Metrics","10 pages; KDD'18 Deep Learning Day, August 2018, London, UK",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When performing data classification over a stream of continuously occurring
instances, a key challenge is to develop an open-world classifier that
anticipates instances from an unknown class. Studies addressing this problem,
typically called novel class detection, have considered classification methods
that reactively adapt to such changes along the stream. Importantly, they rely
on the property of cohesion and separation among instances in feature space.
Instances belonging to the same class are assumed to be closer to each other
(cohesion) than those belonging to different classes (separation).
Unfortunately, this assumption may not have large support when dealing with
high dimensional data such as images. In this paper, we address this key
challenge by proposing a semisupervised multi-task learning framework called
CSIM which aims to intrinsically search for a latent space suitable for
detecting labels of instances from both known and unknown classes.
Particularly, we utilize a convolution neural network layer that aids in the
learning of a latent feature space suitable for novel class detection. We
empirically measure the performance of CSIM over multiple realworld image
datasets and demonstrate its superiority by comparing its performance with
existing semi-supervised methods.

  with Unexpected Hazards","17 pages, 12 images",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vision-based navigation of autonomous vehicles primarily depends on the Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based systems in which the controller obtains input from
sensors/detectors, such as cameras and produces a vehicle control output, such
as a steering wheel angle to navigate the vehicle safely in a roadway traffic
environment. Typically, these DNN-based systems of the autonomous vehicle are
trained through supervised learning; however, recent studies show that a
trained DNN-based system can be compromised by perturbation or adversarial
inputs. Similarly, this perturbation can be introduced into the DNN-based
systems of autonomous vehicle by unexpected roadway hazards, such as debris and
roadblocks. In this study, we first introduce a roadway hazardous environment
(both intentional and unintentional roadway hazards) that can compromise the
DNN-based navigational system of an autonomous vehicle, and produces an
incorrect steering wheel angle, which can cause crashes resulting in fatality
and injury. Then, we develop a DNN-based autonomous vehicle driving system
using object detection and semantic segmentation to mitigate the adverse effect
of this type of hazardous environment, which helps the autonomous vehicle to
navigate safely around such hazards. We find that our developed DNN-based
autonomous vehicle driving system including hazardous object detection and
semantic segmentation improves the navigational ability of an autonomous
vehicle to avoid a potential hazard by 21% compared to the traditional
DNN-based autonomous vehicle driving system.

  Spectral Information",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle myocardium in cardiac CT
angiography (CCTA) is essential for e.g. the assessment of myocardial
perfusion. Automatic deep learning methods for segmentation in CCTA might
suffer from differences in contrast-agent attenuation between training and test
data due to non-standardized contrast administration protocols and varying
cardiac output. We propose augmentation of the training data with virtual
mono-energetic reconstructions from a spectral CT scanner which show different
attenuation levels of the contrast agent. We compare this to an augmentation by
linear scaling of all intensity values, and combine both types of augmentation.
We train a 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) with 10 conventional CCTA
images and corresponding virtual mono-energetic reconstructions acquired on a
spectral CT scanner, and evaluate on 40 CCTA scans acquired on a conventional
CT scanner. We show that training with data augmentation using virtual
mono-energetic images improves upon training with only conventional images
(Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) 0.895 $\pm$ 0.039 vs. 0.846 $\pm$ 0.125). In
comparison, training with data augmentation using linear scaling improves the
DSC to 0.890 $\pm$ 0.039. Moreover, combining the results of both augmentation
methods leads to a DSC of 0.901 $\pm$ 0.036, showing that both augmentations
lead to different local improvements of the segmentations. Our results indicate
that virtual mono-energetic images improve the generalization of an FCN used
for myocardium segmentation in CCTA images.

pulmonary hypertension, require the assessment of the right ventricular (RV)
function. This work addresses the fully automatic and robust access to one of
the key RV biomarkers, its ejection fraction, from the gold standard imaging
modality, MRI. The problem becomes the accurate segmentation of the RV blood
pool from cine MRI sequences. This work proposes a solution based on Fully
Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNN), where our first contribution is the
optimal combination of three concepts (the convolution Gated Recurrent Units
(GRU), the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and the L1 loss function)
that achieves an improvement of 0.05 and 3.49 mm in Dice Index and Hausdorff
Distance respectively with respect to the baseline FCNN. This improvement is
then doubled by our second contribution, the ROI-GAN, that sets two GANs to
cooperate working at two fields of view of the image, its full resolution and
the region of interest (ROI). Our rationale here is to better guide the FCNN
learning by combining global (full resolution) and local Region Of Interest
(ROI) features. The study is conducted in a large in-house dataset of $\sim$
23.000 segmented MRI slices, and its generality is verified in a publicly
available dataset.

using the densely connected convolutional neural network (DenseNet) and gated
recurrent unit network (GRU) for addressing the inter-patient ECG
classification problem. A deep learning model architecture is proposed and is
evaluated using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and Supraventricular Databases. The
results obtained show that without applying any complicated data pre-processing
or feature engineering methods, both of our models have considerably
outperformed the state-of-the-art performance for supraventricular (SVEB) and
ventricular (VEB) arrhythmia classifications on the unseen testing dataset
(with the F1 score improved from 51.08 to 61.25 for SVEB detection and from
88.59 to 89.75 for VEB detection respectively). As no patient-specific or
device-specific information is used at the training stage in this work, it can
be considered as a more generic approach for dealing with scenarios in which
varieties of ECG signals are collected from different patients using different
types of sensor devices.

We use a phase-sensitive lock-in detection at the fundamental and the second
harmonic of the modulation frequency to separate the materials' responses that
are linear and quadratic in Terahertz electric field. We demonstrate this
method by measuring the quadratic Terahertz Kerr effect in the presence of the
much stronger linear electro-optic effect in the (110) GaP crystal. We propose
that the method can be used to detect Terahertz second harmonic generation in
noncentrosymmetric media in time-domain spectroscopy, with broad potential
applications in nonlinear Terahertz photonics and related technology.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which achieve good results for image

continuous attributes. However, flow-based data inevitably contain categorical
attributes such as IP addresses or port numbers. Therefore, we propose three
different preprocessing approaches for flow-based data in order to transform
them into continuous values. Further, we present a new method for evaluating
the generated flow-based network traffic which uses domain knowledge to define
quality tests. We use the three approaches for generating flow-based network
traffic based on the CIDDS-001 data set. Experiments indicate that two of the
three approaches are able to generate high quality data.
