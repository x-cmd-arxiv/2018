  network",,,"10.1002/mp.13421",,"physics.med-ph eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Functional imaging is emerging as an important tool for lung cancer
treatment planning and evaluation. Compared with traditional methods such as
nuclear medicine ventilation-perfusion (VQ), positron emission tomography
(PET), single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT), or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), which use contrast agents to form 2D or 3D functional
images, ventilation imaging obtained from 4DCT lung images is convenient and
cost-effective because of its availability during radiation treatment planning.
Current methods of obtaining ventilation images from 4DCT lung images involve
deformable image registration (DIR) and a density (HU) change-based algorithm
(DIR/HU); therefore the resulting ventilation images are sensitive to the
selection of DIR algorithms. Methods: We propose a deep convolutional neural
network (CNN)-based method to derive the ventilation images from 4DCT directly
without explicit DIR, thereby improving consistency and accuracy of ventilation
images. A total of 82 sets of 4DCT and ventilation images from patients with
lung cancer were studied using this method. Results: The predicted images were
comparable to the label images of the test data. The similarity index and
correlation coefficient averaged over the ten-fold cross validation were
0.883+-0.034 and 0.878+-0.028, respectively. Conclusions: The results
demonstrate that deep CNN can generate ventilation imaging from 4DCT without
explicit deformable image registration, reducing the associated uncertainty.

radial velocities (RVs) and metallicities. From cluster members we derived mean
RVs of RV_NGC1928=249.58+-4.65 km/s and RV_NGC939=258.85+-2.08 km/s, and mean
metallicities of [Fe/H]_NGC1928=-1.30+-0.15 dex and [Fe/H]_NGC1939=-2.00+-0.15
dex. We found that both GCs have RVs and positions consistent with being part
of the LMC disc, so that we rule out any possible origin but that in the same
galaxy. By computing the best solution of a disc that fully contains each GC,
we obtained circular velocities for the 15 known LMC GCs. We found that 11/15
of the GCs share the LMC rotation derived from $HST$ and $Gaia$ DR2 proper
motions. This outcome reveals that the LMC disc existed since the very early
epoch of the galaxy formation and experienced the steep relatively fast
chemical enrichment shown by its GC metallicities. The four remaining GCs
turned out to have circular velocities not compatible with an in situ cluster
formation, but rather with being stripped from the SMC.

Comparing different X-ray energy bands we find localized differences in the
absorbing column and in the emission processes. Collisional ionization may be
prevalent in the area of most intense optical line emission (Halpha and
[OIII]). There is a good correspondence between optical line, radio continuum
and soft (<3 keV) X-ray features, consistent with simulations of jet/molecular
disk interactions. At all energies >3 keV, the extended emission in the central
1"".5 (170 pc) radius circumnuclear region amounts to ~70-30% of the
contribution of a point source in that area (or 40-25% of the total counts in
the region). Within a 5"" radius, the contribution from extended emission
overcomes that from a nuclear point source in the 3-4 keV band. This extended
emission suggests scattering of nuclear photons by dense molecular clouds in
the inner galactic disk of ESO 428-G014. Its presence may adversely bias the

$k \cdot p$ theory has fruitfully served this role for the long time since its
establishment. During the last three decades several problems have been
detected in connection with the application of the $k \cdot p$ approach to such
nanostructures. These problems are closely related to the violation of the
ellipticity conditions for the underlying model, the fact that has been largely
overlooked in the literature. We derive ellipticity conditions for $6 \times
6$, $8\times 8$ and $14 \times 14$ Hamiltonians obtained by the application of
Luttinger-Kohn theory to the bulk zinc blende (ZB) crystals, and demonstrate
that the corresponding models are non-elliptic for many common crystalline
materials. With the aim to obtain the admissible (in terms of ellipticity)
parameters, we further develop and justify a parameter rescaling procedure for
$8\times 8$ Hamiltonians. This allows us to calculate the admissible parameter
sets for GaAs, AlAs, InAs, GaP, AlP, InP, GaSb, AlSb, InSb, GaN, AlN, InN. The
newly obtained parameters are then optimized in terms of the bandstructure fit
by changing the value of the inversion asymmetry parameter $B$ that is proved
to be essential for ellipticity of $8\times 8$ Hamiltonian. The consecutive
analysis, performed here for all mentioned $k \cdot p$ Hamiltonians, indicates
the connection between the lack of ellipticity and perturbative terms
describing the influence of out-of-basis bands on the structure of the
Hamiltonian. This enables us to quantify the limits of models' applicability
material-wise and to suggest a possible unification of two different $14 \times

superconductivity manifests as a zero-bias conductance peak. In weak magnetic
fields, the zero-bias conductance peak is found to exhibit an unusual negative
magnetoresistance when the Kondo temperature is comparable to the
superconductor gap. The observation could not be explained by magnetic field
induced '0-$\pi$' phase transition, topological phase transition, or other
known mechanisms, but may arise from correlation induced interference when
Cooper pairs cotunnel through the quantum dots.

lattice QCD simulations, adopting a stout staggered discretization of the
theory on lattices with $N_t = 6$ slices in the Euclidean temporal direction;
for each value of the pion mass the temperature is changed moving along a line
of constant physics. We find that the decrease of $T_c$ as a function of $B$,
which is observed for physical quark masses, persists in the whole explored
mass range, even if the relative variation of $T_c$ appears to be a decreasing
function of $m_\pi$, approaching zero in the quenched limit. The location of
$T_c$ is based on the renormalized quark condensate and its susceptibility;
determinations based on the Polyakov loop lead to compatible results. On the
contrary, inverse magnetic catalysis, i.e. the decrease of the quark condensate
as a function of $B$ in some temperature range around $T_c$, is not observed
when the pion mass is high enough. That supports the idea that inverse magnetic
catalysis might be a secondary phenomenon, while the modifications induced by
the magnetic background on the gauge field distribution and on the confining
properties of the medium could play a primary role in the whole range of pion

  aquifer model",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hydrological models of karst aquifers are often semi-distributed, and
physical processes such as infiltration and spring discharge generation are
described in a lumped way. Several works have previously addressed the problems
associated with the calibration of such models, highlighting in particular the
issue of model parameter estimation and model equifinality. In this work, we
investigate the problem of model calibration using the active subspace (AS)
method, a novel tool for model parameter dimension reduction. We apply the
method to a newly proposed hydrological model for karst aquifers, LuKARS, to
investigate if the AS framework identifies catchment-specific characteristics
or if the results only depend on the chosen model structure. Therefore, we
consider four different case studies, three synthetic and one real case
(Kerschbaum springshed in Waidhofen a.d. Ybbs, Austria), with varying hydrotope
distributions and properties. We find that both the hydrotope area coverage and
the catchment characteristics have major impacts on parameter sensitivities.
While model parameters are similarly informed in scenarios with less varying
catchment characteristics, we find significant differences in parameter
sensitivities when the applied hydrotopes were different from each other. Our
results show that the AS method can be used to investigate the relation between
the model structure, the area of a hydrotope, the physical properties of a
catchment and the discharge data. Finally, we successfully effectively reduce
the parameter dimensions of the LuKARS model for the Kerschbaum case study
using the AS method. The model with reduced parameter dimensions is able to
reproduce the observed impacts of land use changes in the Kerschbaum
springshed, highlighting the robustness of the hydrotope-based modeling
approach of LuKARS and its applicability for land use change impact studies in
karstic systems.

governing free surface flows are mostly effective in manipulating fluids having
characteristically low values of the electrical conductivity (lower than 0.085

manipulate fluids having higher electrical conductivities. To circumvent the
problem of traditional electrokinetic processes in manipulating highly
conductive fluids mediated by free surface flows, here we demonstrate a novel

alternating electric current and a thermal field. The consequent local
gradients in electrical properties can be tuned to direct the flow towards a

affect the gravitational-wave phase evolution of a neutron-star binary.
Weinberg (2016) suggests that this instability can turn on as the
gravitational-waves pass through the sensitive band of ground-based detectors,
although the size of the effect is not known. The discovery of the binary
neutron star merger GW170817 provides an opportunity to look for evidence of
nonlinear tides from $p$-$g$ mode coupling. We compute Bayesian evidences that
compare waveform models that include the $p$-$g$ mode coupling to models that
do not. Using the waveform model and priors of Essick et al. (2016) we find
that the observation of GW170817 is consistent with $p$-$g$ mode coupling, in
agreement with Abbott, B. P., et al. (2019a). We investigate the properties of
the model and find that this consistency is due to degeneracy in a large region
of the parameter space between the the model that includes nonlinear tides from
$p$-$g$ mode coupling and the standard post-Newtonian model that does not. We
investigate the consistency of the GW170817 signal with regions of the
parameter space where the effect of nonlinear tides is not degenerate with the
standard model. Regions of the nonlinear tide parameter space that have a
fitting factor of less than 99$\%$ (98.5$\%$) are disfavored by a Bayes factor
of 15 (25). We conclude that the consistency of the GW170817 signal with the

elements by a novel, elegant and simple numerical analysis and corresponding
numerical experiments, whenever the momentum balance is dominated by forces of
a gradient type. More precisely, a reduction of the $L^2$ convergence order for
high order methods, and even a complete stall of the $L^2$ convergence order
for lowest-order methods on preasymptotic meshes is predicted by the analysis
and practically observed. On the other hand, it is also shown that
(structure-preserving) pressure-robust mixed methods do not suffer from this
locking phenomenon, even if they are of lowest-order. A connection to
well-balanced schemes for (vectorial) hyperbolic conservation laws like the
shallow water or the compressible Euler equations is made.

producing a light curve with a faint echo. This echo, and others from
subsequent flares, can lead to the planet's discovery, revealing its orbital
configuration and physical characteristics. A challenge is that an echo is
faint relative to the flare and measurement noise. Here, we use a method, based
on autocorrelation function estimation, to extract faint planetary echoes from
stellar flare light curves. A key component of our approach is that we
compensate for planetary motion, measures of echo strength are then co-added
into a strong signal. Using simple flare models in simulations, we explore the
feasibility of this method with current technology for detecting planets around
nearby M dwarfs. We also illustrate how our method can tightly constrain a
planet's orbital elements and the mass of its host star. This technique is most
sensitive to giant planets within 0.1 au of active flare stars and offers new
opportunities for planet discovery in orientations and configurations that are
inaccessible with other planet search methods.

During its normal operation, the turbine blades experience a continuous change

This work presents a re-examination of the two phenomena, that shows the

$\kappa$, the \emph{Resonance Casimir-Polder interaction (RCPI)} between two

composition of the interiors of small, hot, rocky exoplanets because the
interior is evaporating and that material is condensing into dust, which is
being blown away and then transiting the star. Their transit signal is
dominated by dusty effluents forming a comet-like tail trailing the host planet
(or leading it, in the case of K2-22b), making these good candidates for
transmission spectroscopy. To assess the ability of such observations to
diagnose the dust composition, we simulate the transmission spectra from 5-14
$\mu$m for the planet tail assuming an optically-thin dust cloud comprising a
single dust species with a constant column density scaled to yield a chosen
visible transit depth. We find that silicate resonant features near 10 $\mu$m
can produce transit depths that are at least as large as those in the visible.
For the average transit depth of 0.55% in the Kepler band for K2-22b, the
features in the transmission spectra can be as large as 1%, which is detectable
with the JWST MIRI low-resolution spectrograph in a single transit. The
detectability of compositional features is easier with an average grain size of
1 $\mu$m despite features being more prominent with smaller grain sizes. We
find most features are still detectable for transit depths of ~0.3% in the
visible range. If more disintegrating planets are found with future missions
such as the space telescope TESS, follow-up observations with JWST can explore

formation activity are linked to their structure, as traced by their population
of dense cores. We also find that the fraction of massive cores that are the
most mass segregated in each region correlates with the surface density of star
formation in the clouds. The Taurus region with low star-forming activity is
associated with a highly hierarchical spatial distribution of the cores (low Q
value) and the cores show no sign of being mass segregated. On the other
extreme, the mini-starburst region W43-MM1 has a higher Q that is suggestive of
a more centrally condensed structure and it possesses a higher fraction of
massive cores that are segregated by mass. While some limited evolutionary
effects might be present, we attribute the correlation between the star

challenging task necessitating the simultaneous treatment of quantum

subjected to a uniform and static electric field is prototypical, raising key
questions such as the fate of Bloch oscillations with increasing correlation
strength, the approach to a steady state DC transport regime and the role of
dissipation in it, and electric field driven phase transitions. We develop here
an effective large-N Keldysh field theory for studying nonequilibrium transport
in a regular one-dimensional dissipative Mott insulator system subjected to a
uniform electric field. Upon abruptly turning on the electric field (a quench),
a transient oscillatory current response reminiscent of Bloch oscillations is
found. In the regime of small tunneling conductance the amplitude of these
oscillations, over a large time window, decreases as an inverse square
power-law in time, ultimately going over to an exponential decay beyond a large
characteristic time that increases with N. Such a relaxation to a steady state
DC response is absent in the dissipation free Hubbard chain at half filling.
The steady state current at small fields is governed by large distance
cotunneling, a process absent in the equilibrium counterpart. The low-field DC
current has a Landau-Zener-Schwinger form but qualitatively differs from the
expression for pair-production probability for the dissipation free
counterpart. The breakdown of perturbation theory in the Mott phase possibly
signals a nonequilibrium phase transition to a metallic phase. Our study sheds
light on the approach of a driven, dissipative strongly correlated system to a
nonequilibrium steady state and also provides a general analytic microscopic
framework for understanding other nonequilibrium phenomena in these systems.

identified in the field include Lya emitters (LAEs), massive star-forming
galaxies, and ultra-massive galaxies (log (Mstar/Msun)>= 11) which may have
already halted their star formation. The sky distribution of the star-forming
galaxies suggests the presence of a significant overdensity (delta_g=8+/-2),
which is spatially offset from the previously confirmed members by 3-4 Mpc to
the west. Candidate quiescent and post-starburst galaxies are also found in
large excess (a factor of ~ 8-15 higher surface density than the field)
although their redshifts are less certain. We estimate that the total enclosed
mass traced by star-forming galaxy candidates is roughly comparable to that of
PC217.96+32.3 traced by the LAEs. We speculate that the true extent of

our LAE selection. Alternatively, the newly discovered overdensity may belong
to another Coma progenitor not associated with PC217.96+32.3. Expectations from
theory suggest that both scenarios are equally unlikely (<1%), particularly in
the cosmic volume probed in our survey. If confirmed as a single structure, its
total mass will be well in excess of Coma, making this a singularly large
cosmic structure rarely seen even in large cosmological simulations. Finally,
we find that the protocluster galaxies follow the same SFR-M_star scaling

automated systems into decision-making procedures highlights not only the
importance of decision theory for automated systems but also the need for these
decision procedures to be explainable to the people involved in them.
Traditional realist accounts of explanation, wherein explanation is a relation
that holds (or does not hold) eternally between an explanans and an
explanandum, are not adequate to account for the notion of explanation required
for artificial decision procedures. We offer an alternative account of
explanation as used in the context of automated decision-making that makes
explanation an epistemic phenomenon, and one that is dependent on context. This
account of explanation better accounts for the way that we talk about, and use,
explanations and derived concepts, such as `explanatory power', and also allows
us to differentiate between reasons or causes on the one hand, which do not
need to have an epistemic aspect, and explanations on the other, which do have
such an aspect. Against this theoretical backdrop we then review existing
approaches to explanation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and
suggest desiderata which truly explainable decision systems should fulfill.

proposed modern-day analogues of the globular clusters (GCs) that were products
of extreme star formation in the early universe. The exact conditions and
mechanisms under which YMCs form remain unknown -- a fact further complicated
by the extreme radiation fields produced by their numerous massive young stars.
Here we show that GC-sized clusters are naturally produced in
radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of isolated 10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$ Giant
Molecular Clouds (GMCs) with properties typical of the local universe, even
under the influence of radiative feedback. In all cases, these massive clusters
grow to GC-level masses within 5 Myr via a roughly equal combination of
filamentary gas accretion and mergers with several less massive clusters.
Lowering the heavy-element abundance of the GMC by a factor of 10 reduces the
opacity of the gas to radiation and better represents the high-redshift
formation conditions of GCs. This results in higher gas accretion leading to a
mass increase of the largest cluster by a factor of ~4. When combined with
simulations of less massive GMCs (10$^{4-6}$ M$_{\odot}$), a clear relation
emerges between the maximum YMC mass and the mass of the host GMC. Our results
demonstrate that YMCs, and potentially GCs, are a simple extension of local
cluster formation to more massive clouds and do not require suggested exotic
formation scenarios.

radiative hydrodynamics simulations for the formation of young massive clusters
to track their chemical self-enrichment during their first 5 Myr. These
clusters form embedded within filamentary Giant Molecular Clouds by a
combination of gas accretion and rapid merging of protoclusters. Chemical
enrichment is a dynamic process happening as the young cluster assembles, so
that the original (1P) and enriched (2P) subpopulations of stars form almost
simultaneously. Here we test two simple and opposite extremes for the injection
of enriched material into the intracluster gas: we assume either continuous
injection in a way that tracks the star formation rate; or sudden injection by
a single instantaneous event. Using helium abundance as a proxy for the
enrichment, we find that realistic multiple population features can be
reproduced by injecting a total helium mass amounting to a few percent of the
cluster's total mass. The differences in individual growth histories can lead
to widely differing 1P/2P outcomes. These models suggest that dual or multiple
populations can emerge rapidly in massive star clusters undergoing the typical
mode of star cluster formation.

The quotient of this group by its homogeneous Weyl subgroup gives a principal
fiber bundle with 2n-dim base manifold and Weyl fibers. The Cartan
generalization to a curved 2n-dim geometry admits an action functional linear
in the curvatures. Because symmetry is maintained between the translations and
the special conformal transformations in the construction, these spaces are
called biconformal; this same symmetry gives biconformal spaces overlapping
structures with double field theories, including manifest T duality. We
establish that biconformal geometry is a form of double field theory, showing
how general relativity with integrable local scale invariance arises from its
field equations. While we discuss the relationship between biconformal
geometries and the double field theories of T-dual string theories, our
principal interest is the study of the gravity theory. We show that vanishing
torsion and vanishing co-torsion solutions to the field equations overconstrain
the system, implying a trivial biconformal space. Wih co-torsion unconstrained,
we show that (1) the torsion-free solutions are foliated by copies of an n-dim

scale-invariant general relativity with symmetric, divergence-free sources on
either the co-tangent bundle of n-dim (p,q)-spacetime or the torus of double
field theory, and (3) torsion-free solutions admit a subclass of spacetimes
with n-dim non-abelian Lie symmetry. These latter cases include the possibility
of a gravity-electroweak unification. It is notable that the field equations
reduce all curvature components to dependence only on the solder form of an

Seyfrert 1 galactic nucleus NGC~7469 using the RXTE and ASCA observations. We
demonstrate strong observational evidence that NGC~7469 undergoes spectral
transitions from the low hard state (LHS) to the intermediate state (IS) during
these observations. The RXTE observations (1996--2009) show that the source was
in the IS ~ 75 % of the time only, ~ 25 % of the time in the LHS. The spectra
of NGC~7469 are well fitted by the so-called bulk motion Comptonization (BMC)
model for all spectral states. We have established the photon index saturation
level, Gamma_{sat}+2.1+/-0.1, in the Gamma versus mass accretion rate, Mdot
correlation. This Gamma- Mdot correlation allows us to estimate the black hole
(BH) mass in NGC~7469 to be M__BH> 3 x 10^6 solar masses assuming the distance
to NGC~7469 of 70 Mpc. For this BH mass estimate, we use the scaling method
taking Galactic BHs, GRO~J1655--40, Cyg~ X--1 and an extragalactic BH source,
NGC~4051 as reference sources. The Gamma versus Mdot correlation revealed in
NGC~7469 is similar to those in a number of Galactic and extragalactic BHs and
it clearly shows the correlation along with the strong Gamma saturation at
~2.1. This is robust observational evidence for the presence of a BH in
NGC~7469. We also find that the seed photon temperatures are quite low, of the
order of 140-200 eV, which are consistent with a high BH mass in NGC~7469 that
is more than 3x10^6 solar masses.

used in printing to reproduce multi-color images. For mechanical reasons, these
color separations are generally not perfectly aligned with respect to each
other when they are rendered by their respective imaging stations. This
phenomenon, called color plane misregistration, causes gap and halo artifacts
in the printed image. Color trapping is an image processing technique that aims
to reduce these artifacts by modifying the susceptible edge boundaries to
create small, unnoticeable overlaps between the color planes. We propose three
low-complexity algorithms for automatic color trapping which hide the effects
of small color plane mis-registrations. Our algorithms are designed for
software or embedded firmware implementation. The trapping method they follow
is based on a hardware-friendly technique proposed by J. Trask (JTHBCT03) which
is too computationally expensive for software or firmware implementation. The
first two algorithms are based on the use of look-up tables (LUTs). The first
LUT-based algorithm corrects all registration errors of one pixel in extent and
reduces several cases of misregistration errors of two pixels in extent using
only 727 Kbytes of storage space. This algorithm is particularly attractive for
implementation in the embedded firmware of low-cost formatter-based printers.
The second LUT-based algorithm corrects all types of misregistration errors of
up to two pixels in extent using 3.7 Mbytes of storage space. The third
algorithm is a hybrid one that combines LUTs and feature extraction to minimize
the storage requirements (724 Kbytes) while still correcting all
misregistration errors of up to two pixels in extent. This algorithm is
suitable for both embedded firmware implementation on low-cost formatter-based
printers and software implementation on host-based printers.

information on user channel quality becomes a major drawback in practical

beamforming we allow NOMA to exploit the space domain, and hence the user angle
emerges as a promising (yet novel) limited feedback scheme. We show that as the
user region for NOMA transmission gets wider, the users become more distinctive
at the transmitter side with respect to their angles, making user angle
feedback a better alternative than distance feedback in such scenarios. We
rigorously derive and analyze the outage sum rate performance for NOMA

sum rates using those feedback schemes match closely with simulations, and
provide useful insights on properly choosing a limited feedback scheme for

evolutionary tree when data concerning the underlying species set are given.
These data typically come in the form of DNA, RNA or protein alignments, which
consist of various characters (also often referred to as sites). Often,
however, tree reconstruction methods based on criteria like maximum parsimony
may fail to provide a unique tree for a given dataset, or, even worse,
reconstruct the `wrong' tree (i.e. a tree that differs from the one that
generated the data). On the other hand it has long been known that if the
alignment consists of all the characters that correspond to edges of a
particular tree, i.e. they all require exactly $k=1$ substitution to be
realized on that tree, then this tree will be recovered by maximum parsimony
methods. This is based on Buneman's theorem in mathematical phylogenetics. It
is the goal of the present manuscript to extend this classic result as follows:
We prove that if an alignment consists of all characters that require exactly
$k=2$ substitutions on a particular tree, this tree will always be the unique
maximum parsimony tree (and we also show that this can be generalized to
characters which require at most $k=2$ substitutions). In particular, this also
proves a conjecture based on a recently published observation by Goloboff et
al. affirmatively for the special case of $k=2$.

binary with a neutron star primary and a red giant companion in a $\sim$5.4 day
orbit. This initial conclusion, based on optical and X-ray data, was confirmed
when a 2.66 ms radio pulsar was found at the same location (and with the same
orbital properties) as the optical/X-ray source. However, these initial studies
found conflicting evidence about the accretion state and other properties of
the binary. We present new optical, radio, and X-ray observations of J1417 that
allow us to better understand this unusual system. We show that one of the main
pieces of evidence previously put forward for an accretion disk---the complex
morphology of the persistent H$\alpha$ emission line---can be better explained
by the presence of a strong, magnetically driven stellar wind from the
secondary and its interaction with the pulsar wind. The radio spectral index
derived from VLA/ATCA observations is broadly consistent with that expected
from a millisecond pulsar, further disfavoring an accretion disk scenario.
X-ray observations show evidence for a double-peaked orbital light curve,
similar to that observed in some redback millisecond pulsar binaries and likely
due to an intrabinary shock. Refined optical light curve fitting gives a
distance of 3.1$\pm$0.6 kpc, confirmed by a Gaia DR2 parallax measurement. At
this distance the X-ray luminosity of J1417 is (1.0$^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$) $\times
10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is more luminous than all known redback systems in
the rotational-powered pulsar state, perhaps due to the wind from the giant
companion. The unusual phenomenology of this system and its differing
evolutionary path from redback millisecond pulsar binaries points to a new
eclipsing pulsar ""spider"" subclass that is a possible progenitor of normal

matter density distribution of the nearby Universe is measured through redshift
or line-of-sight peculiar velocity surveys. However, both methods require
model-dependent distance measures to place the galaxies or to differentiate
peculiar velocity from the Hubble expansion. In this paper, we use the
correlated proper motions of galaxy pairs from the VLBA Extragalactic Proper
Motion Catalog to place limits on the transverse peculiar velocity of galaxy
pairs with comoving separations <1500 Mpc without a reliance on precise
distance measurements. The relative proper motions of galaxy pairs across the
line of sight can be directly translated into relative peculiar velocities
because no proper motion will occur in a homogeneous expansion. We place a 3
sigma limit on the relative proper motion of pairs with comoving separations <
100 Mpc of -17.4 microas/yr < thetadot / sin theta < 19.8 microas/yr. We also
confirm that large-separation objects (> 200 Mpc) are consistent with pure
Hubble expansion to within ~ 5.3 microas/yr (1 sigma). Finally, we predict that
Gaia end-of-mission proper motions will be able to significantly detect the
mass distribution of large-scale structure on length scales < 25 Mpc. This
future detection will allow a test of the shape of the theoretical mass power

developed by several authors for log-concave probability distributions. In this
work we replace the log-concavity assumption with a log-concavity at infinity
condition. We provide novel $L^2$ convergence rates for Euler schemes,
expressed explicitly in terms of problem parameters. From there we derive
non-asymptotic bounds on the distance between the laws induced by Euler schemes
and the invariant laws of SDEs, both for schemes with standard and with
randomised (inaccurate) drifts. We also obtain bounds for the hierarchy of
discretisation, which enables us to deploy a multi-level Monte Carlo estimator.
Our proof relies on a novel construction of a coupling for the Markov chains
that can be used to control both the $L^1$ and $L^2$ Wasserstein distances
simultaneously. Finally, we provide a weak convergence analysis that covers
both the standard and the randomised (inaccurate) drift case. In particular, we
reveal that the variance of the randomised drift does not influence the rate of
weak convergence of the Euler scheme to the SDE.

Millimeter Array. Together, these images comprise the first spatially resolved
thermal dataset with complete coverage of Europa's surface. The resulting
brightness temperatures correspond to a frequency of 233 GHz (1.3 mm) and a
typical linear resolution of roughly 200 km. At this resolution, the images
capture spatially localized thermal variations on the scale of geologic and
compositional units. We use a global thermal model of Europa to simulate the
ALMA observations in order to investigate the thermal structure visible in the

large-scale daytime thermal structure on Europa largely results from bolometric
albedo variations across the surface. Using bolometric albedos extrapolated
from Voyager measurements, a homogenous model reproduces these patterns well,
but localized discrepancies exist. These discrepancies can be largely explained
by spatial inhomogeneity of the surface thermal properties. Thus, we use the
four ALMA images to create maps of the surface thermal inertia and emissivity
at our ALMA wavelength. From these maps, we identify a region of either
particularly high thermal inertia or low emissivity near 90 degrees West and 23
degrees North, which appears anomalously cold in two of our images.

is also clear that the formation of C vacancies depends on the growth
conditions: For TM-rich conditions, B1-structured carbides will always favour C
vacancy formation. For C-rich conditions it is energetically favourable to form
C vacancies in ScC, VC, NbC, CrC, MoC and WC. Experimentally large C vacancy
concentrations are found in B1-structured TM carbides and our calculations are
in line with these observations. In fact, TiC, ZrC, HfC and TaC are the only
B1-structured TM carbides that do not spontaneously favour C vacancies and then
only for C-rich conditions. C vacancies may still be present in these systems,
however, due to the high temperatures used when growing TM carbides. In the
case of WC-structured TM carbides, C vacancy formation is not energetically
favourable irrespective of the growth conditions, which is the reason why this

L-leap method instantaneously updates the system state vector at discrete time

be stationary during each time bucket. We propose to use Multilevel Monte Carlo
(MLMC) to efficiently propagate the uncertainties in a supply chain network,

we combine molecular dynamics and high-speed force spectroscopy on the

excellent agreement at overlapping velocities and provided evidence of the

and visits various intermediate states far from the binding pocket while
streptavidin undergoes transient induced fits, all varying with loading rate.
This multistate process slows down the transition to the unbound state and
favors rebinding, thus explaining the long lifetime of the complex. We provide
an atomistic, dynamic picture of the unbinding process, replacing a simple
two-state picture with one that involves many routes to the lock and
rate-dependent induced-fit motions for intermediates, which might be relevant

compact Riemannian manifold $M$, in this paper we define the concept of
unstable topological entropy of $f$ on a set $Y \subset M$ not necessarily
compact and we extend a theorem of R. Bowen proving that, for an ergodic
$f$-invariant measure $\mu$, the unstable measure theoretical entropy of $f$ is
upper bounded by the unstable topological entropy of $f$ on any set of full
$\mu$-measure. We also define a notion of unstable topological entropy of $f$
using a Hausdorff dimension like characterization.

Additional references added to main text","Nature Communications 10, 1581 (2019)","10.1038/s41467-019-09436-y",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scrambling of quantum information is the process by which information
initially stored in the local degrees of freedom of a quantum many-body system
spreads over its many-body degrees of freedom, becoming inaccessible to local
probes and thus apparently lost. Scrambling and entanglement are key concepts
reconciling seemingly unrelated behaviors including thermalization of isolated
quantum systems and information loss in black holes, and have revolutionized
our understanding of non-equilibrium phenomena. Here, we demonstrate that a
family of fidelity out-of-time-order correlators (FOTOCs), recently measured in
a trapped-ion quantum simulator via time reversal of the many-body dynamics
followed by a fidelity measurement, can serve as a unifying diagnostic tool
that elucidates the intrinsic connection between fast scrambling, volume law
entanglement, ergodicity, quantum chaos, and the associated butterfly effect in
the semiclassical dynamics of the system. We demonstrate the utility of FOTOCs
by computing them in the Dicke model, an iconic model in quantum optics,
recently implemented in atomic and trapped-ion setups. This model describes the
coupling of a large spin to an oscillator and features rich behaviors,
including a quantum phase transition and chaos. Here, we show that FOTOCs
provide a direct measure of the spin-phonon Renyi entropy and quantum
thermalization. Moreover, we connect the FOTOCs to the variance of simple
operators, allowing us to observe fast scrambling in the parameter regime where
the system's classical trajectories are chaotic, and to explicitly relate the
quantum and classical Lyapunov exponents in a truly quantum many-body system.
Our results open a path for the experimental use of FOTOCs to quantify fast
scrambling, determine bounds on quantum information processing and to identify
possible candidates of black hole analogs in controllable quantum systems.

synthetic city on the statistics of displacements. Our city is constituted
initially by a set of streets that form a regular tessellation of the euclidean
plane. Therefore we will have three types of cities, formed by squares,
triangles or hexagons. We studied the complementary cumulative distribution
function for displacements (CCDF). For the whole set of streets the CCDF is a
stretched exponential, and as streets are deleted this function becomes a
linear function and then two clear different exponentials. This behavior is
qualitatively the same for all the tessellations. Most of this functions has
been reported in the literature when studying the displacements of individuals
based on cell data trajectories and GPS information. However, in the light of
this work, the appearance of different functions for displacements CCDF can be
attributed to the connectivity of the underlying street network. It is
remarkably that for some proportion of streets we got a linear function for
such function, and as far as we know this behavior has not been reported nor
considered. Therefore, it is advisable to analyze experimental in the light of

(MIMO) systems is limited by the sparse nature of propagation channels and the
restricted number of radio frequency (RF) chains at transceivers. The
introduction of reconfigurable antennas offers an additional degree of freedom
on designing mmWave MIMO systems. This paper provides a theoretical framework
for studying the mmWave MIMO with reconfigurable antennas. Based on the virtual
channel model, we present an architecture of reconfigurable mmWave MIMO with
beamspace hybrid analog-digital beamformers and reconfigurable antennas at both
the transmitter and the receiver. We show that employing reconfigurable
antennas can provide throughput gain for the mmWave MIMO. We derive the
expression for the average throughput gain of using reconfigurable antennas in
the system, and further derive the expression for the outage throughput gain
for the scenarios where the channels are (quasi) static. Moreover, we propose a
low-complexity algorithm for reconfiguration state selection and beam
selection. Our numerical results verify the derived expressions for the
throughput gains and demonstrate the near-optimal throughput performance of the
proposed low-complexity algorithm.

Due to the central role of thrombin, thrombin generation and specifically the
thrombin generation curve (TGC) is commonly used as an indicator of haemostatic
activity. Functional characteristics of the haemostatic system in neonates and
children are significantly different compared with adults; at the same time
plasma levels of haemostatic proteins vary considerably with age. However,
relating one to the other has been difficult, both due to significant
inter-individual differences for individuals of similar age and the complexity
of the biochemical reactions underlying haemostasis. Mathematical modelling has
been very successful at representing the biochemistry of blood clotting. In
this study we address the challenge of large inter-individual variability by
parameterising the Hockin-Mann model with data from individual patients, across
different age groups from neonates to adults. Calculating TGCs for each patient
of a specific age group provides us with insight into the variability of
haemostatic activity across that age group. From our model we observe that two
commonly used metrics for haemostatic activity are significantly lower in
neonates than in older patients. Because both metrics are strongly determined
by prothrombin and prothrombin levels are considerably lower in neonates we
conclude that decreased haemostatic activity in neonates is due to lower
prothrombin availability.

ferroelectric material that is composed of three perovskite-like units and one
fluorite-like unit stacked alternatively along the $c$-direction. The ground
state crystal structure is monoclinic with the spontaneous polarization (~50
$\mu$C/cm$^{2}$) along the in-plane $b$-direction. BiT typically grows along
the $c$-direction in thin film form and having the polarization vector aligned
with the growth orientation can be beneficial for several potential device
applications. It is well known that judicious doping of ferroelectrics is an
effective method in adjusting the magnitude and the orientation of the
spontaneous polarization. Here, we show using first-principles density
functional theory and a detailed phonon analysis that Bi atoms in the
fluorite-like layers have significantly more impact on the magnitude and
orientation of the spontaneous polarization vector as compared to the
perovskite-like layer. The low energy hard phonon modes are characterized by
fluorite-like layers experiencing transverse displacements and large changes in
Born effective charges on Bi atoms. Thus, the breaking of symmetry caused by
doping of Bi sites within the fluorite-like layer leads to the formation of
uncancelled permanent dipole moments along the $c$-direction. This provides an
opportunity for doping the Bi site in the fluorite-like layer. Isovalent
dopants P, As, and Sb were studied. P is found to be most effective in the
reorientation of the spontaneous polarization. It leads to a three-fold
enhancement of the $c$-component of polarization and to a commensurate rotation
of the spontaneous polarization vector by 36.2$^{\circ}$ towards the
$c$-direction.

from averaging and cosmological backreaction on observational predictions could

unequal dynamic and geometric spatial curvatures, there is little evidence for
differing Hubble scales within these phenomenological template models.

an illustration of a selected trait, we consider the elastic energy of an
important conformational change within an elastic network model, and we show
that selection acting on this energy leads to correlations among residues. For
this concrete example and more generally, we demonstrate that the main
signature of functional sectors lies in the small-eigenvalue modes of the
covariance matrix of the selected sequences. However, secondary signatures of
these functional sectors also exist in the extensively-studied large-eigenvalue
modes. Our simple, general model leads us to propose a principled method to

problems which are much harder to solve than smooth optimization problems. Most
of these tools have not been translated to clinical PET data, as the
state-of-the-art algorithms for non-smooth problems do not scale well to large

advanced randomized optimization algorithms to solve the PET reconstruction

total variation, total generalized variation, directional total variation and
various different physical constraints. The proposed algorithm randomly uses
subsets of the data and only updates the variables associated with these. While
this idea often leads to divergent algorithms, we show that the proposed
algorithm does indeed converge for any proper subset selection. Numerically, we
show on real PET data (FDG and florbetapir) from a Siemens Biograph mMR that
about ten projections and backprojections are sufficient to solve the MAP

population studies and fisheries stock assessments. ELEFAN (Electronic LEngth
Frequency ANalysis) is a widely used method to fit a growth curve to
length-frequency distribution (LFD) data. However, up to now, it was not
possible to assess its accuracy or the uncertainty inherent of this method, or
to obtain confidence intervals for growth parameters within an unconstrained
search space. In this study, experiments were conducted to assess the precision
and accuracy of bootstrapped and single-fit ELEFAN-based curve fitting methods,
using synthetic LFDs with known input parameters and a real data set of Abra
alba shell lengths. The comparison of several types of bootstrap experiments
and their outputs (95% confidence intervals and confidence contour plots)
provided a first glimpse into the accuracy of modern ELEFAN-based fit methods.
The main components of uncertainty (precision and reproducibility of fit
algorithms, seed effects, sample size and matrix information content) could be
assessed from partial bootstraps. Uncertainty was mainly determined by LFD
matrix size, total number of non-zero bins and the sampling of large-sized
individuals. A new pseudo-Rsquared index for the goodness-of-fit of VBGF models
to LFD data is proposed. For a large, perfect synthetic data set,
pseudo-RsquaredPhi was very high (88 to 100%), indicating an excellent fit of
the VBGF model. The small Abra alba data set showed a low pseudo-RsquaredPhi,
from to 54% to 68%, indicating the need for more samples and a larger LFD data
matrix. New, robust, bootstrap-based methods for curve fitting are presented
and discussed. This study demonstrates a promising new path for length-based
analyses of growth and mortality in natural populations, which are the basis
for a new suite of methods that are included in the new fishboot package.

Brauer and partition monoids, along with the algebras they generate, has
heavily influenced the direction of research by a significant number of
mathematicians and physicists. Examples include Schur-Weyl type dualities in
representation theory along with Potts, ice-type and Andrew-Baxter-Forrester
models from statistical mechanics, giving strong motivation for the planar
modular partition monoid to be examined.
  The original results contained within this thesis relating to the planar
modular partition monoid are: the establishment of generators; recurrence
relations for the cardinality of the monoid; recurrence relations for the
cardinality of Green's $\mathcal{R}$, $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{D}$
relations; and a conjecture on relations that appear to present the planar
modular partition monoid when $m=2$. For diagram semigroups that are closed

$\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ relations have previously been established

exposition of the fundamentals of diagram semigroups, which have traditionally
been approached from the representation theory side and have since blossomed

gamma-ray photons from three flares, which according to \stereo occurred in
active regions behind the limb of the Sun as delineated by near Earth
instruments. For two of these flares \r has provided HXR images with sources
located just above the limb, presumably from the loop top (LT) region of a
relatively large loop. Fermi-Gamma-ray Burst Monitor has detected HXRs and
gamma-rays, and RSTN has detected microwaves emissions with similar light
curves. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of these multi-wavelength
observations assuming that HXRs and microwaves are produced by electrons
accelerated at the LT source, with emphasize on the importance of the proper
treatment of escape of the particles from the acceleration-source region and
the trans-relativistic nature of the analysis. The observed spectra are used to
determine the magnetic field and relativistic electron spectra. It is found
that a simple power-law in momentum (with cut off above a few 100 MeV) agrees
with all observations, but in energy space a broken power law spectrum
(steepening at rest mass energy) may be required. It is also shown that the
production of the $>100$ MeV photons detected by The Fermi-Large Area Telescope
at the LT source would require more energy compared to photospheric emission.
These energies are smaller than that required for electrons, so that the
possibility that all the emissions originate in the LT cannot be ruled out on
energetic grounds. However, the differences in the light curves and emission
centroids of HXRs and $>100$ MeV gamma-rays favour a different source for the
latter.

contained in dust grains, and its variation provides key insights into the life
cycle of dust. We measure the dust-to-metals ratio in M101, a nearby galaxy
with a radial metallicity (Z) gradient spanning $\sim$1 dex. We fit the dust
spectral energy distribution from 100 to 500 $\mu m$ with five variants of the
modified blackbody dust emission model in which we vary the temperature
distribution and how emissivity depends on wavelength. Among them, the model
with a single temperature blackbody modified by a broken power-law emissivity
gives the statistically best fit and physically most plausible results. Using
these results, we show that the dust-to-gas ratio is proportional to $\rm
Z^{1.7}$. This implies that the dust-to-metals ratio is not constant in M101,
but decreases as a function of radius, equivalent to a lower fraction of metals
trapped in dust at low metallicity (large radius). The dust-to-metals ratio in
M101 remains at or above what would be predicted by the minimum depletion level
of metals observed in the Milky Way. Our current knowledge of
metallicity-dependent CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor suggests that variations in
the conversion factor cannot be responsible for the dust-to-metals ratio trends
we observe. This change of dust-to-metals ratio is significantly correlated
with molecular hydrogen fraction, which suggests that the accretion of gas
phase metals onto existing dust grains could be a mechanism contributing to a

exploratory article proposes a direct method based on frequency distributions

languages, which can be considered from a complex outlook as information
processing machines, and which somehow manage to set appropriate levels of
redundancy, already ""made the choice"" whether a linguistic unit is a phoneme or
not, and this would be reflected in a greater smoothness in a frequency versus

reasonable to consider the Spanish semiconsonant /w/ as a separate phoneme from
its vowel counterpart /u/, on the one hand, and possibly also the semiconsonant
/j/ as a separate phoneme from its vowel counterpart /i/, on the other. As
language has been so central a topic in the study of complexity, this
discussion grants us, in addition, an opportunity to gain insight into emerging
properties in the broader complex systems debate.

main contribution is the design, evaluation, and optimization of DNN
architectures of increasing depth for heart disease diagnosis. This work led to
the discovery of a novel five layer DNN architecture - named Heart Evaluation
for Algorithmic Risk-reduction and Optimization Five (HEARO-5) -- that yields
best prediction accuracy. HEARO-5's design employs regularization optimization
and automatically deals with missing data and/or data outliers. To evaluate and
tune the architectures we use k-way cross-validation as well as Matthews
correlation coefficient (MCC) to measure the quality of our classifications.
The study is performed on the publicly available Cleveland dataset of medical
information, and we are making our developments open source, to further
facilitate openness and research on the use of DNNs in medicine. The HEARO-5

geometrical features of the embedded manifold, proving that the manifold
enlarges or shrinks locally isotropically so that it is always embedded

curvature converges to a constant or diverges to infinity slowly. The distance
between two signals also changes, converging eventually to a stable fixed
value, provided both the number of neurons in a layer and the number of layers
tend to infinity. This causes a problem, since when we consider a curve in the
input space, it is mapped as a continuous curve of fractal nature, but our
theory contradictorily suggests that the curve eventually converges to a
discrete set of equally spaced points. In reality, the numbers of neurons and

the discrepancies between our theory and reality. We need to further study the
discrepancies to understand their implications on information processing.

these parameters. Our studies are based on the X-ray data from the Swift/BAT
catalogue. We confirm previous results that radio galaxies are on average
X-ray-louder than radio-quiet AGNs, but find that their spectral slopes are
very similar. This suggests that in radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs the hard
X-rays are produced in the same region and by the same mechanism. We argue that
this region can be associated with the hot, geometrically thick, central
portion of the accretion flow, where production of hard X-rays is likely to be
dominated by Comptonization of the optical/UV radiation of the truncated 'cold'
accretion disc by hot electrons. The larger X-ray luminosities in radio-loud
AGNs may result from larger radiative efficiencies of the innermost portions of
the accretion flows around faster rotating black holes.

spontaneous breaking of an emergent U(1) symmetry, for attractive interactions.
Despite the fact that the U(1) symmetry is not exact, this transition was
claimed to be in a supersymmetric universality class when time reversal

signals to output signals. Its input-output relation is considered to be
stochastic, being described for a given input by a parameterized conditional
probability distribution of outputs. The space of parameters consisting of
weights and biases is a Riemannian manifold, where the metric is defined by the
Fisher information matrix. The natural gradient method uses the steepest
descent direction in a Riemannian manifold, so it is effective in learning,
avoiding plateaus. It requires inversion of the Fisher information matrix,
however, which is practically impossible when the matrix has a huge number of
dimensions. Many methods for approximating the natural gradient have therefore
been introduced. The present paper uses statistical neurodynamical method to
reveal the properties of the Fisher information matrix in a net of random
connections under the mean field approximation. We prove that the Fisher
information matrix is unit-wise block diagonal supplemented by small order
terms of off-block-diagonal elements, which provides a justification for the
quasi-diagonal natural gradient method by Y. Ollivier. A unitwise
block-diagonal Fisher metrix reduces to the tensor product of the Fisher
information matrices of single units. We further prove that the Fisher
information matrix of a single unit has a simple reduced form, a sum of a
diagonal matrix and a rank 2 matrix of weight-bias correlations. We obtain the
inverse of Fisher information explicitly. We then have an explicit form of the
natural gradient, without relying on the numerical matrix inversion, which
drastically speeds up stochastic gradient learning.

paper answers the following question: What is the optimal balance between these
three competing benefits? We answer this question in the context of the
downlink of a cellular network, where multi-antenna BSs serve multiple
single-antenna users using zero-forcing beamforming with equal power
assignment, while nulling interference at a subset of out-of-cell users. Any
remaining spatial dimensions provide transmit diversity for the scheduled
users. Utilizing tools from stochastic geometry, we show that, surprisingly, to
maximize the per-BS ergodic sum rate, with an optimal allocation of spatial
resources, interference nulling does not provide a tangible benefit. The
strategy of avoiding inter-cell interference nulling, reserving some fraction
of spatial resources for multiplexing and using the rest to provide diversity,
is already close-to-optimal in terms of the sum-rate. However, interference
nulling does bring significant benefit to cell-edge users, particularly when
adopting a range-adaptive nulling strategy where the size of the cooperating BS
cluster is increased for cell-edge users.

from various sources with unusual radio morphologies, we found numerous
remnant-type double radio sources with very diffuse lobes in VLASS, both with

observing frequency of VLASS is well suited for the optical identification of
radio sources, and despite its limited sensitivity to extended emission, allows
to reveal large radio galaxies based on morphological features unrecognizable

hypothesizes their depths to obtain a 3D skeleton. We propose a novel Random
Projection layer, which randomly projects the generated 3D skeleton and sends
the resulting 2D pose to the discriminator. The discriminator improves by
discriminating between the generated poses and pose samples from a real
distribution of 2D poses. Training does not require correspondence between the

magnetic field to a Coulomb gas leads to an unscreened logarithmic interaction
between the vortices, and with periodic boundary conditions vortex
configurations are always vorticity neutral with an equal number of plus and
minus vortices. We demonstrate that relaxing the neutrality condition has
certain advantages. It leads to non-neutral vortex configurations that can
appear in real systems with open boundary conditions and permits calculation of
the compressibility, which for thin film superconductors corresponds to the
magnetic permeability. The vortex-number fluctuation has remarkable scaling
properties at and below the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The
fugacity variable becomes dangerously irrelevant in the low-temperature phase
and leads to a multiplicative scaling correction to the mean-square
vortex-number fluctuation and to the magnetic permeability. This multiplicative
correction strongly affects the scaling properties of the vorticity fluctuation
at and below the transition. Consequences of these findings are demonstrated
using Monte Carlo simulations. Inclusion of the next-higher order correction to

their position on the $\sigma$ vs. M$_B$ plane coincides -- depending on the

key non-electrical features seen during action potentials are reviewed; a shift
in birefringence, the pattern of heat emission and absorption, and the
expansion of cell diameter. How the soliton wave model uses the lipid phase
transition to account for each of these three phenomena is contrasted with
alternatives which might be consistent with the Hodgkin-Huxley model of action
potentials. It is suggested that changes in membrane potential during the
action potential might have a significant effect on membrane proteins and
contribute to the production of each of these phenomena. A key assumption of
the soliton wave model is that lipid phase transitions are common and adaptive
in life. However a review of the literature suggests that often lipid phase
transitions are damaging to cells, and so are often avoided. There is a need
for clearer evidence as to whether or not neurons actually do have liquid
crystalline to gel lipid phase transitions happening in them during action
potentials, as the soliton model assumes. Several major paradigm shifts are
associated with the soliton wave model, and with the proposal of induced lipid

$\calB$ denoted by $\EC_\calB(f):= \min_C \EC_{\calB}(C)$ where $C$ is a
circuit over $\calB$ computing $f$.
  We study the case when $\calB = \{\land_2, \lor_2, \lnot\}$, the standard
Boolean basis. It is known that any Boolean function can be computed by a
circuit (with potentially large size) with an energy of at most
$3n(1+\epsilon(n))$ for a small $ \epsilon(n)$(which we observe is improvable
to $3n-1$). We show several new results and connections between energy
complexity and other well-studied parameters of Boolean functions.
  * For all Boolean functions $f$, $\EC(f) \le O(\DT(f)^3)$ where $\DT(f)$ is
the optimal decision tree depth of $f$.
  * We define a parameter \textit{positive sensitivity} (denoted by $\psens$),
a quantity that is smaller than sensitivity and defined in a similar way, and
show that for any Boolean circuit $C$ computing a Boolean function $f$, $
\EC(C) \ge \psens(f)/3$.
  * For a monotone function $f$, we show that $\EC(f) = \Omega(\KW^+(f))$ where
$\KW^+(f)$ is the cost of monotone Karchmer-Wigderson game of $f$.
  * Restricting the above notion of energy complexity to Boolean formulas, we
show $\EC(F) = \Omega\left (\sqrt{L(F)}-depth(F)\right )$ where $L(F)$ is the
size and $depth(F)$ is the depth of a formula $F$.

upload, share, and record food images, recipes, cooking videos, and food
diaries, leading to large-scale food data. Large-scale food data offers rich
knowledge about food and can help tackle many central issues of human society.
Therefore, it is time to group several disparate issues related to food
computing. Food computing acquires and analyzes heterogenous food data from
disparate sources for perception, recognition, retrieval, recommendation, and
monitoring of food. In food computing, computational approaches are applied to
address food related issues in medicine, biology, gastronomy and agronomy. Both
large-scale food data and recent breakthroughs in computer science are
transforming the way we analyze food data. Therefore, vast amounts of work has
been conducted in the food area, targeting different food-oriented tasks and
applications. However, there are very few systematic reviews, which shape this
area well and provide a comprehensive and in-depth summary of current efforts
or detail open problems in this area. In this paper, we formalize food
computing and present such a comprehensive overview of various emerging
concepts, methods, and tasks. We summarize key challenges and future directions
ahead for food computing. This is the first comprehensive survey that targets
the study of computing technology for the food area and also offers a
collection of research studies and technologies to benefit researchers and

cyclic graphs of length 4 or larger. A 2-graph G is Eulerian if all vertex
degrees of G are even. An edge refinement of a graph splits an edge (a,b) to
two edges (a,c),(c,b) and connects the newly added vertex c to the intersection
of S(a) with S(b). Theorem I assures that every 2-graph can be rendered
Eulerian by successive edge refinements. The construction is explicit using
geodesic cutting. After the refinement, we have an Eulerian 2-graph that
carries a natural geodesic flow. We construct some ergodic ones. A 2-graph with
boundary is finite simple graph for which every unit sphere is either a path
graph of length n larger than 1 or a cyclic graph of length larger than 3.
2-balls are special 2-graphs are simply connected with a circular boundary.
Theorem II tells that every 2-ball can be edge refined using interior edges to
become Eulerian if and only if its boundary has length divisible by 3. A
billiard map is defined already if all interior vertices have even degree. We
will construct some ergodic billiards in 2-balls, where the geodesics bouncing
off at the boundary symmetrically and which visit every interior edge exactly
once. A consequence of Theorem II is that an Eulerian billiard which is ergodic
must have a boundary length that is divisible by 3. We also construct other
2-graphs like tori with ergodic geodesic flows. This clashes with experience in
the continuum, where tori have periodic points minimizing the length in
homology classes of paths. Ergodic Eulerian 2-graphs or billiards are exciting
because they satisfy a Hopf-Rynov result: there exists a geodesic connection
between any two vertices. We get so unique canonical metric associated to any
ergodic Eulerian graph. It is non-local in the sense that two adjacent vertices
can have large distance.

7.3 K.In this article, we investigate the influence of Sn intercalation on
superconducting properties of 2H-NbSe2. Sn being nonmagnetic and having no
outer shell d-electrons unlike transition metals, one naively would presume
that its effect on superconducting properties will be very marginal. However,
our magnetic and transport studies reveal a significant reduction of both
superconducting transition temperature and upper critical field [Tc and BC2
(0)] upon Sn intercalation. With a mere 4 mole% Sn intercalation, it is
observed that Tc and BC2 (0) get suppressed by ~ 3.5 K and 3 T, respectively.
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) analysis of magneto-transport data is
performed to estimate BC2 (0). From the low temperature Raman scattering data
in the normal phase of intercalated NbSe2, it is inferred that the suppression
of superconductivity cannot be ascribed to strengthening of charge density wave
(CDW)ordering. The effects such as electron-doping induced Fermi surface change
and/or disorder scattering upon intercalation are speculated to be at play for
the observed phenomena.

on the probability of winning as a key input. However calculating the precise
probability using combinatorics is an intractable problem, so instead we
approximate it. Monte Carlo simulation is an effective technique that can be
used to approximate the probability that a player will win and/or tie a hand.
However, without the use of a memory-intensive lookup table or a supercomputer,
it becomes infeasible to run millions of times when training an agent with
self-play. To combat the space-time tradeoff, we use deep learning to
approximate the probabilities obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation with
high accuracy. The learned model proves to be a lightweight alternative to
Monte Carlo simulation, which ultimately allows us to use the probabilities as

after each phase a decision is made about whether to move a molecule forward.
Early phase efficacy decisions are often made on the basis of single arm
studies based on RECIST tumor response as endpoint. This decision rules are
implicitly assuming some form of surrogacy between tumor response and long-term
endpoints like progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). The
surrogacy is most often assessed as weak, but sufficient to allow a rapid
decision making as early phase studies lack the survival follow up and number
of patients to properly assess PFS or OS. With the emergence of therapies with
new mechanisms of action, for which the link between RECIST tumor response and
long-term endpoints is either not accessible yet because not enough data is
available to perform a meta-regression, or the link is weaker than with
classical chemotherapies, tumor response based rules may not be optimal. In
this paper, we explore the use of a multistate model for decision making based
on single-arm early phase trials. The multistate model allows to account for
more information than the simple RECIST response status, namely, the time to
get to response, the duration of response, the PFS time and time to death. We
propose to base the decision on efficacy on the OS hazard ratio (HR), predicted
from a multistate model based on early phase data with limited survival
follow-up, combined with historical control data. Using three case studies and
simulations, we illustrate the feasibility of the estimation of the OS HR using
a multistate model based on limited data from early phase studies. We argue
that, in the presence of limited follow up and small sample size, and on
assumptions within the multistate model, the OS prediction is acceptable and
may lead to better decisions for continuing the development of a drug.

number of solutions to an underdetermined system of linear equations $Ax = b$,
where the coordinates of the vector $x$ are restricted to take values in some
small subset (e.g. $\{\pm 1\}$) of the underlying field. The classical ways of
bounding this quantity are to use either a rank bound observation due to
Odlyzko or a vector anti-concentration inequality due to Hal\'asz. The former
gives a stronger conclusion except when the number of equations is
significantly smaller than the number of variables; even in such situations,
the hypotheses of Hal\'asz's inequality are quite hard to verify in practice.
In this paper, using a novel approach to the anti-concentration problem for
vector sums, we obtain new Hal\'asz-type inequalities which beat the Odlyzko
bound even in settings where the number of equations is comparable to the
number of variables. In addition to being stronger, our inequalities have
hypotheses which are considerably easier to verify. We present two applications

unfortunately, computing it in general is computationally intractable. Two
popular (variational) approximation schemes for estimating the free energy of
general Ising models (in particular, even in regimes where correlation decay
does not hold) are: (i) the mean-field approximation with roots in statistical
physics, which estimates the free energy from below, and (ii) hierarchies of
convex relaxations with roots in theoretical computer science, which estimate
the free energy from above. We show, surprisingly, that the tight regime for
both methods to compute the free energy to leading order is identical.
  More precisely, we show that the mean-field approximation is within
$O((n\|J\|_{F})^{2/3})$ of the free energy, where $\|J\|_F$ denotes the
Frobenius norm of the interaction matrix of the Ising model. This
simultaneously subsumes both the breakthrough work of Basak and Mukherjee, who
showed the tight result that the mean-field approximation is within $o(n)$
whenever $\|J\|_{F} = o(\sqrt{n})$, as well as the work of Jain, Koehler, and
Mossel, who gave the previously best known non-asymptotic bound of
$O((n\|J\|_{F})^{2/3}\log^{1/3}(n\|J\|_{F}))$. We give a simple, algorithmic
proof of this result using a convex relaxation proposed by Risteski based on
the Sherali-Adams hierarchy, automatically giving sub-exponential time
approximation schemes for the free energy in this entire regime. Our
algorithmic result is tight under Gap-ETH.
  We furthermore combine our techniques with spin glass theory to prove (in a
strong sense) the optimality of correlation rounding, refuting a recent
conjecture of Allen, O'Donnell, and Zhou. Finally, we give the tight
generalization of all of these results to $k$-MRFs, capturing as a special case

human-machine communications, as emotion is an essential part of human-to-human
communications. One aspect of emotion is reflected in the language we use. How
to represent emotions in texts is a challenge in natural language processing
(NLP). Although continuous vector representations like word2vec have become the
new norm for NLP problems, their limitations are that they do not take emotions
into consideration and can unintentionally contain bias toward certain
identities like different genders.
  This thesis focuses on improving existing representations in both word and
sentence levels by explicitly taking emotions inside text and model bias into
account in their training process. Our improved representations can help to
build more robust machine learning models for affect-related text
classification like sentiment/emotion analysis and abusive language detection.
  We first propose representations called emotional word vectors (EVEC), which
is learned from a convolutional neural network model with an emotion-labeled
corpus, which is constructed using hashtags. Secondly, we extend to learning
sentence-level representations with a huge corpus of texts with the pseudo task
of recognizing emojis. Our results show that, with the representations trained
from millions of tweets with weakly supervised labels such as hashtags and
emojis, we can solve sentiment/emotion analysis tasks more effectively.
  Lastly, as examples of model bias in representations of existing approaches,
we explore a specific problem of automatic detection of abusive language. We
address the issue of gender bias in various neural network models by conducting
experiments to measure and reduce those biases in the representations in order
to build more robust classification models.

scales. Most of the nearest-neighbor spin correlations are independent of the
details of evolution, due to the formation of rigid domains. The correlations
on a fractal set of domain walls are found to be variable and to depend
distinctly on the noise history and the initial state. Correlations in samples
with independent initial configurations are found to persistently differ when
subject to identical noise histories, for coarsening scales of up to hundreds
of lattice units. However, samples with identical initial configurations and
subject to independent noise histories have correlations that converge to each

ocean are key components of on-shelf nutrient budgets and biogeochemical
cycles. On a regional scale, submarine canyons enhance physical processes such
as shelf-slope mass exchange and mixing. There is good understanding of the
flow around upwelling submarine canyons; however, the flux of biologically
relevant tracers is less understood. This work investigates the impact of
submarine canyons on the cross-shelf exchange of tracers and water, taking into
account the impact of locally-enhanced mixing within the canyon, and develops a
scaling estimate for canyon-induced upwelling of tracers, proportional to local
concentration, vertical diffusivity, and previously scaled upwelling flux. For
that purpose, we performed numerical experiments simulating an upwelling event
near an idealized canyon, adding a passive tracer with an initially linear
profile. We varied the geographic distribution of vertical eddy diffusivity and
its magnitude, the initial stratification, Coriolis parameter, and the strength
of the incoming flow. We find that a canyon, of width 5% of the length of the
shelf, upwells between 25 to 89% more tracer mass onto the shelf than coastal
upwelling. Locally-enhanced vertical diffusivity has a positive effect on the
tracer that is advected by the upwelling flow and can increase canyon-upwelled
tracer flux by up to 27%.

functions of scalar field are assumed for the function $f(\phi)$ function. For
the power-law and exponential functions, a constant slow-roll parameter
$\epsilon$ is obtained which produced difficulties for the graceful exit from

exponential type, $\Psi_{\rm ex}=\exp(F) \Phi_0$, with the uncorrelated

TOFS formalism based on Hermitian form, it is shown that the energy per

mode-collapsing during training. We study the issue of mode collapse of
Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Network (BEGAN), which is one of
the state-of-the-art generative models. Despite its potential of generating
high-quality images, we find that BEGAN tends to collapse at some modes after a
period of training. We propose a new model, called \emph{BEGAN with a
Constrained Space} (BEGAN-CS), which includes a latent-space constraint in the
loss function. We show that BEGAN-CS can significantly improve training
stability and suppress mode collapse without either increasing the model
complexity or degrading the image quality. Further, we visualize the
distribution of latent vectors to elucidate the effect of latent-space
constraint. The experimental results show that our method has additional
advantages of being able to train on small datasets and to generate images
similar to a given real image yet with variations of designated attributes
on-the-fly.

  synonymous codon usage",,,,,"q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background Synonymous codon choice is mainly affected by mutation and
selection. For the majority of genes within a genome, mutational pressure is
the major driving force, but selective strength can be strong and dominant for
specific set of genes or codons. More specifically, the selective strength on
translational efficiency and accuracy increases with the gene's expression
level. Many statistical approaches have been developed to evaluate and quantify
the selective profile in codon usage, including S index and Akashi's test, but
no program or pipeline has been developed that includes these tests and
automates the calculation.
  Results In this study, we release an R package SSCU (selective strength for
codon usage, v2.4.0), which includes tools for codon usage analyses. The
package identifies optimal codons using two approaches (comparative and
correlative methods), implements well-established statistics for detecting
codon selection, such as S index, Akashi's test, and estimates standard genomic
statistics, such as genomic GC3, RSCU and Nc.
  Conclusions The package is useful for researchers working on the codon usage
analysis, and thus has general interest to the biological research community.
The package is deposited and curated at the Bioconductor site, and has
currently been downloaded for more than 2000 times and ranked as top 50%
packages.

(Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a popular sparse modeling
method while it has been known to yield unexpected large bias especially at a
sparse representation. There have been several studies for improving this
problem such as the introduction of non-convex regularization terms. The
important point is that this bias problem directly affects model selection in
applications since a sparse representation cannot be selected by a prediction
error based model selection even if it is a good representation. In this
article, we considered to improve this problem by introducing a scaling that
expands LASSO estimator to compensate excessive shrinkage, thus a large bias in
LASSO estimator. We here gave an empirical value for the amount of scaling.
There are two advantages of this scaling method as follows. Since the proposed
scaling value is calculated by using LASSO estimator, we only need LASSO
estimator that is obtained by a fast and stable optimization procedure such as
LARS (Least Angle Regression) under LASSO modification or coordinate descent.
And, the simplicity of our scaling method enables us to derive SURE (Stein's
Unbiased Risk Estimate) under the modified LASSO estimator with scaling. Our
scaling method together with model selection based on SURE is fully empirical
and do not need additional hyper-parameters. In a simple numerical example, we
verified that our scaling method actually improves LASSO and the SURE based
model selection criterion can stably choose an appropriate sparse model.

sets. The problem of training a deep net on a few or one sample per class

using only a few representatives of these classes. This problem has previously
been approached by meta-learning. Here we propose a novel meta-learner which
shows state-of-the-art performance on common benchmarks for one/few shot
classification. Our model features three novel components: First is a
feed-forward embedding that takes random class support samples (after a
customary CNN embedding) and transfers them to a better class representation in
terms of a classification problem. Second is a novel attention mechanism,
inspired by competitive learning, which causes class representatives to compete
with each other to become a temporary class prototype with respect to the query
point. This mechanism allows switching between representatives depending on the
position of the query point. Once a prototype is chosen for each class, the
predicated label is computed using a simple attention mechanism over prototypes
of all considered classes. The third feature is the ability of our meta-learner
to incorporate deeper CNN embedding, enabling larger capacity. Finally, to ease
the training procedure and reduce overfitting, we averages the top $t$ models
(evaluated on the validation) over the optimization trajectory. We show that
this approach can be viewed as an approximation to an ensemble, which saves the
factor of $t$ in training and test times and the factor of of $t$ in the

$\textit{Herschel}$ with other tracers of ionised gas, we build a picture of
this dense plasma. We adopt a collisional ionisation model, so the analysis is
not tied to a specific energisation mechanism. We find that the dense plasma is
concentrated in a disk that is $130\;{\rm pc}$ thick, and makes a significant
contribution to radio pulsar dispersion measures in the inner Galactic plane.
The strength of the far infrared N$^+$ emission requires high temperatures in
the plasma, with $T \simeq 19{,}000\,{\rm K}$ indicated both by the ratio of
N$^+$ to C$^+$, and by the ratio of N$^+$ to microwave bremsstrahlung in the

where strong optical emission is observed from N$^+$ (and S$^+$), relative to
both H$\alpha$ and microwave bremsstrahlung, and suggests a common origin. If
so, the same gas provides a natural explanation for the extreme radio-wave
scattering phenomena that are sometimes observed in pulsars and quasars. We
therefore propose a new picture of the warm ionised medium as seen in emission,
in which the plasma is dense, hot, and localised in numerous structures of size

DATP regresses importance of different temporal segments and generates weights

is no need of additional supervision except video-level activity class label.
We conduct extensive experiments to investigate various input features and
different weight models. Experimental results show that DATP can learn to
assign large weights to key video segments. More importantly, DATP can improve
training of frame-level feature extractor. This is because relevant temporal

development in a duct at different Reynolds numbers, a StreamVane distortion
generating device was designed and experimentally analyzed in a small-scale
low-speed wind tunnel (ReD 500,000) and in a full-scale engine testing rig (ReD
3 million). Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry was used to measure the
three-component velocity fields at discrete measurement planes downstream of
the distortion device. Results show that the secondary flow is generated and
develops very similarly in both scales, and is mostly driven by two-dimensional
(2D) vortex dynamics. Induced velocities arising from the proximity of the
vortex to the duct wall causes the vortex center to convect circumferentially
around the duct, in the same sense as the vortex rotation, as it travels
downstream. Small-scale turbulence results show small-scale instabilities
related to the development of the vortex. This work shows that the development
of this vane-generated, vortex-dominated flow is largely Reynolds number
independent for the covered range, so that details of similar duct-bounded

processed by a separated deep convolutional network, allowing to take decisions
independently from each modality, we introduce a central network linking the
modality specific networks. This central network not only provides a common
feature embedding but also regularizes the modality specific networks through
the use of multi-task learning. The proposed approach is validated on 4
different computer vision tasks on which it consistently improves the accuracy
of existing multimodal fusion approaches.

the problem of identifying deep network generated (DNG) images. Taking the
differences between camera imaging and DNG image generation into
considerations, we analyze the disparities between DNG images and real images
in different color components. We observe that the DNG images are more
distinguishable from real ones in the chrominance components, especially in the
residual domain. Based on these observations, we propose a feature set to
capture color image statistics for identifying DNG images. Additionally, we
evaluate several detection situations, including the training-testing data are
matched or mismatched in image sources or generative models and detection with
only real images. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method
can accurately identify DNG images and outperforms existing methods when the

between the observed and predicted seismograms suffers from local minima.
Recently, earth mover's distance (EMD) has been introduced to FWI to compute
the misfit between two seismograms. Instead of comparisons bin by bin, EMD
allows to compare signal intensities across different coordinates. This measure
has great potential to account for time and space shifts of events within
seismograms. However, there are two main challenges in application of EMD to
FWI. The first one is that the compared signals need to satisfy nonnegativity
and mass conservation assumptions. The second one is that the computation of
EMD between two seismograms is a computationally expensive problem. In this
paper, a strategy is used to satisfy the two assumptions via decomposition and
recombination of original seismic data. In addition, the computation of EMD
based on dynamic formulation is formulated as a convex optimization problem. A
primal-dual hybrid gradient method with linesearch has been developed to solve
this large-scale optimization problem on GPU device. The advantages of the new
method are that it is easy to implement and has high computational efficiency.
Compared to LSD based FWI, the computation time of the proposed method will
approximately increase by 11% in our case studies. A 1D time-shift signals case
study has indicated that EMD is more effective in capturing time shift and
makes the misfit function more convex. Two applications to synthetic data using
transmissive and reflective recording geometries have demonstrated the
effectiveness of EMD in mitigating cycle-skipping issues. We have also applied
the proposed method to SEG 2014 benchmark data, which has further demonstrated
that EMD can mitigate local minima and provide reliable velocity estimations
without using low frequency information in the recorded data.

attacks on Tor. Despite the importance of flow correlation attacks on Tor,
existing flow correlation techniques are considered to be ineffective and
unreliable in linking Tor flows when applied at a large scale, i.e., they
impose high rates of false positive error rates or require impractically long
flow observations to be able to make reliable correlations. In this paper, we
show that, unfortunately, flow correlation attacks can be conducted on Tor
traffic with drastically higher accuracies than before by leveraging emerging
learning mechanisms. We particularly design a system, called DeepCorr, that
outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant margins in correlating Tor
connections. DeepCorr leverages an advanced deep learning architecture to learn
a flow correlation function tailored to Tor's complex network this is in
contrast to previous works' use of generic statistical correlation metrics to
correlated Tor flows. We show that with moderate learning, DeepCorr can
correlate Tor connections (and therefore break its anonymity) with accuracies
significantly higher than existing algorithms, and using substantially shorter
lengths of flow observations. For instance, by collecting only about 900
packets of each target Tor flow (roughly 900KB of Tor data), DeepCorr provides
a flow correlation accuracy of 96% compared to 4% by the state-of-the-art
system of RAPTOR using the same exact setting.
  We hope that our work demonstrates the escalating threat of flow correlation
attacks on Tor given recent advances in learning algorithms, calling for the
timely deployment of effective countermeasures by the Tor community.

$l_{ls}$, we reveal two qualitatively different regimes in the nonlinear heat

detailed structure of the F/I interfaces is inessential. Here $T_s$ is the

of dense gas mass (Mdg) involved in the formation of stars both for distant
galaxies and clouds in our Galaxy. Similarly, the mass accretion rate (Macc)
and the disk mass (Mdisk) of young, Class II stars are also linearly
correlated. We plotted the corresponding observational data together, finding a
statistically significant correlation that spans ~ 16 orders of magnitude. This
probably represents one of the widest ranges of any empirical correlation
known, encompassing galaxies that are several kpc in size, pc-size star-forming
clouds within our Galaxy, down to young, pre-main sequence stars with au-size
protoplanetary disks. We propose a bottom-up hypothesis suggesting that a
relation between Macc and the total circumstellar mass surrounding Class 0/I
sources (Mcs; disk+envelope) drives the correlation in protostellar-hosting
clouds and cloud-hosting galaxies. This is consistent with the fact that the
SFRs derived for clouds over a timescale of 2 Myr can be roughly recovered from
the sum of instantaneous Macc values of the protostars embedded within them,
implying that galactic SFRs averaged over ~ 10-100 Myr should be constant over
this period too. Moreover, the sum of the Mcs values directly participating in
the formation of the protostellar population in a cloud likely represents a
non-negligible fraction of the Mdg within the cloud. If such fraction is ~
1-35% of the Mdg associated with star-forming clouds and galaxies, then the
global correlation for all scales has a near unity slope and an intercept
consistent with the (proto-)stellar accretion timescale, Mcs/Macc. Therefore,
an additional critical test of our hypothesis is that the Macc-Mdisk
correlation for Class II stars should also be observed between Macc and Mcs for
Class 0/I sources with similar slope and intercept.

  and minor improvements regarding the hypotheses of some theorems. To appear
  in Mem. Amer. Math. Soc",,,,"math.GT math.AT math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The simplicial volume is a homotopy invariant of manifolds introduced by
Gromov in 1982. In order to study its main properties, Gromov himself initiated
the dual theory of bounded cohomology, that developed into an active and
independent research field. Gromov's theory of bounded cohomology was based on
the use of multicomplexes, which are simplicial structures that generalize
simplicial complexes without allowing all the degeneracies appearing in
simplicial sets.
  In the first part of this paper we lay the foundation of the theory of
multicomplexes. We construct the singular multicomplex K(X) associated to a
topological space X, and we prove that K(X) is homotopy equivalent to $X$ for
every CW complex X. Following Gromov, we introduce the notion of completeness,
which translates into the context of multicomplexes the Kan condition for
simplicial sets. We then develop the homotopy theory of complete
multicomplexes.
  In the second part we apply the theory of multicomplexes to the study of the
bounded cohomology of topological spaces. We provide complete proofs of
Gromov's Mapping Theorem (which implies that the bounded cohomology of a space
only depends on its fundamental group) and of Gromov's Vanishing Theorem, which
ensures the vanishing of the simplicial volume of closed manifolds admitting an
amenable cover of small multiplicity.
  The third part is devoted to the study of locally finite chains on
non-compact spaces. We expand some ideas of Gromov to provide complete proofs
of a criterion for the vanishing and a criterion for the finiteness of the
simplicial volume of open manifolds. As a by-product of these results, we prove
a criterion for the l^1-invisibility of closed manifolds in terms of amenable
covers. As an application, we give the first complete proof of the vanishing of
the simplicial volume of the product of three open manifolds.

space and astrophysical sources is of critical importance in the analysis of

acceleration and transport mechanisms at work. This paper addresses this
general problem, in particular in solar flares, where in addition to scattering
by turbulence, the magnetic field convergence from the acceleration region
towards its boundaries also influences the particle escape. We test an
(approximate) analytic relation between escape and scattering times, and the
field convergence rate, based on the work of Malyshkin and Kulsrud (2001),
valid for both strong and weak diffusion limits and isotropic pitch angle
distribution of the injected particles, with a numerical model of particle
transport. To this end, a kinetic Fokker-Planck transport model of particles is
solved with a stochastic differential equation scheme assuming different
initial pitch angle distributions. This approach enables further insights into
the phase-space dynamics of the transport process, which would otherwise not be
accessible. We find that in general the numerical results agree well with the
analytic equation for the isotropic case, however, there are significant
differences weak diffusion regime for non-isotopic cases, especially for
distributions beamed along the magnetic field lines. The results are important
in the interpretation of observations of energetic particles in solar flares,
and other similar space and astrophysical acceleration sites and for the
determination of acceleration-transport coefficients, commonly used in
Fokker-Planck type kinetic equations.

transits of planetary debris as well as absorption lines from circumstellar

broad-band photometry of the system, obtained with the Gran Telescopio Canarias

$5.5$ h, somewhat longer than the $4.5$-h orbital period of the debris.
Dividing the GTC spectrophotometry into five wavelength bands reveals no
significant colour differences, confirming grey transits in the optical. We
argue that absorption by an optically thick structure is a plausible
alternative explanation for the achromatic nature of the transits that can
allow the presence of small-sized ($\sim\mu$m) particles. The longest ($87$
min) and deepest ($50$ per cent attenuation) transit recorded in our data
exhibits a complex structure around minimum light that can be well modelled by
multiple overlapping dust clouds. The strongest circumstellar absorption line,
Fe II $\lambda$5169, significantly weakens during this transit, with its
equivalent width reducing from a mean out-of-transit value of $2$ \AA\ to $1$
\AA\ in-transit, supporting spatial correlation between the circumstellar gas

outward velocity of about 140 kms-1 that can be interpreted as an upwards
propagating wave in the 304 A and 171 A lines; higher speeds are seen in 193 A
(up to 1000 km/s). The ejection of the cold He II plasma is delayed by about 4
min in the lowest layer and more than 12 min in the highest level compared to
the hot 193 A behavior. A study of the dynamics using time-slice diagrams
reveals that a large amount of fast ejected material originates from below the

cylinder with quasi-parallel edge-enhanced walls. After the initial phase of a
longitudinal acceleration, the speed substantially reduces and the ejecta
disperse into the environment. Finally, the detailed temporal and spatial

however, usually assumed to be zero because of neutralization due to the
presence of plasma. We revisit the question of the SMBH charge and put
realistic limits on its value, timescales of charging and discharging, and
observable consequences of the potential, small charge associated with the
Galactic centre black hole. The electric charge due to classical arguments
based on the mass difference between protons and electrons is $\lesssim
10^9\,{\rm C}$ and is of a transient nature on the viscous time-scale. However,
the rotation of a black hole in magnetic field generates electric field due to
the twisting of magnetic field lines. This electric field can be associated
with induced charge, for which we estimate an upper limit of $\lesssim
10^{15}\,{\rm C}$. Moreover, this charge is most likely positive due to an
expected alignment between the magnetic field and the black-hole spin. Even a
small charge of this order significantly shifts the position of the innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO) of charged particles. In addition, we propose a
novel observational test based on the presence of the bremsstrahlung surface
brightness decrease, which is more sensitive for smaller unshielded electric
charges than the black-hole shadow size. Based on this test, the current upper
observational limit on the charge of Sgr A* is $\lesssim 3\times 10^{8}\,{\rm

A volumetric (tetrahedral) skull model encoding the variations of different
skulls, a surface head model encoding the head variations, and a dense
statistic of facial soft tissue thickness (FSTT). All data are automatically
derived from computed tomography (CT) head scans and optical face scans. In
order to obtain a proper dense FSTT statistic, we register a skull model to
each skull extracted from a CT scan and determine the FSTT value for each
vertex of the skull model towards the associated extracted skin surface. The
FSTT values at predefined landmarks from our statistic are well in agreement
with data from the literature.
  To recover a face from a skull remain, we first fit our skull model to the
given skull. Next, we generate spheres with radius of the respective FSTT value
obtained from our statistic at each vertex of the registered skull. Finally, we
fit a head model to the union of all spheres. The proposed automated method
enables a probabilistic face-estimation that facilitates forensic recovery even
from incomplete skull remains. The FSTT statistic allows the generation of
plausible head variants, which can be adjusted intuitively using principal
component analysis. We validate our face recovery process using an anonymized
head CT scan. The estimation generated from the given skull visually compares
well with the skin surface extracted from the CT scan itself.

cosmological constraints from tomographic cosmic shear analyses. These analyses
differ in many aspects: the datasets, the shear and photometric redshift
estimation algorithms, the theory model assumptions, and the inference
pipelines. To assess the robustness of the existing cosmic shear results, we
present in this paper a unified analysis of four of the recent cosmic shear
surveys: the Deep Lens Survey (DLS), the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing
Survey (CFHTLenS), the Science Verification data from the Dark Energy Survey

By using a unified pipeline, we show how the cosmological constraints are
sensitive to the various details of the pipeline. We identify several analysis
choices that can shift the cosmological constraints by a significant fraction
of the uncertainties. For our fiducial analysis choice, considering a Gaussian
covariance, conservative scale cuts, assuming no baryonic feedback
contamination, identical cosmological parameter priors and intrinsic alignment
treatments, we find the constraints (mean, 16% and 84% confidence intervals) on

emerged from: the sheer breadth of the regulation; questions around how to

bilayer system, where mobile point charges, all of the same sign, are immersed
into the space left between two parallel, homogeneously charged plates (with
possibly different charge densities). At vanishing temperatures, the particles
are expelled from the slab interior; they necessarily stick to one of the two
plates, and form there ordered sublattices. Using complementary tools (analytic
and numerical) we study systematically the self-assembly of the point charges
into ordered ground state configurations as the inter-layer separation and the
asymmetry in the charge densities are varied. The overwhelming plethora of
emerging Wigner bilayer ground states can be understood in terms of the
competition of two strategies of the system: the desire to guarantee net charge
neutrality on each of the plates and the effort of the particles to
self-organize into commensurate sublattices. The emerging structures range from
simple, highly commensurate (and thus very stable) lattices (such as staggered
structures, built up by simple motives) to structures with a complicated
internal structure. The combined application of our two approaches (whose
results agree within remarkable accuracy) allows to study on a quantitative
level phenomena such as over- and underpopulation of the plates by the mobile
particles, the nature of phase transitions between the emerging phases (which
pertain to two different universality classes), and the physical laws that
govern the long-range behaviour of the forces acting between the plates.
Extensive Monte Carlo simulations, which have been carried out at small, but
finite temperatures along selected, well-defined pathways in parameter space
confirm the analytical and numerical predictions within high accuracy.

interesting for investigation of chirality-sensitive light-matter interactions.
Recent breakthroughs have enabled generation of such light sources via high
harmonic generation (HHG) from rare gases. There is a growing interest in
extending HHG medium from gases to solids, especially to 2D materials, as they
hold great promise to develop ultra-compact solid-state photonic devices and
provide insights into electronic properties of the materials themselves.
However, HHG in graphene driven by terahertz to mid-infrared fields reported so
far only generate low harmonic orders, and furthermore no harmonics driven by
circularly polarized lasers. Here, using first-principles simulations within a
time-dependent density-functional theory framework, we show that it is possible
to generate HHG extending to the XUV spectral region in monolayer extended
graphene excited by near-infrared lasers. Moreover, we demonstrate that a
single circularly polarized driver is enough to ensure HHG in graphene with
circular polarization. The corresponding spectra reflect the six-fold
rotational symmetry of the graphene crystal. Extending HHG in graphene to the
XUV spectral regime and realizing circular polarization represent an important
step towards the development of novel nanoscale attosecond photonic devices and
numerous applications such as spectroscopic investigation and nanoscale imaging
of ultrafast chiral and spin dynamics in graphene and other 2D materials.

secure power grid operations. It is, therefore, necessary to make accurate wind
power prediction and its uncertainty quantification. Wind power forecasting
usually depends on wind speed prediction and the wind-to-power conversion
process. However, most current wind power prediction models only consider
portions of the uncertainty. This paper develops an integrative framework for
predicting wind power density, considering uncertainties arising from both wind
speed prediction and the wind-to-power conversion process. Specifically, we
model wind speed using the inhomogeneous Geometric Brownian Motion and convert
the wind speed prediction density into the wind power density in a closed-form.
The resulting wind power density allows quantifying prediction uncertainties
through prediction intervals. To forecast the power output, we minimize the
expected prediction cost with (unequal) penalties on the overestimation and
underestimation. We show the predictive power of the proposed approach using
data from multiple operating wind farms located at different sites.

increase in He content from the canonical value (Y = 0.245) to Y = 0.30 and
0.40 causes a simultaneous increase in stellar luminosity and in pulsation
period. To investigate the dependence of the RRL distance scale on the He
abundance, we computed new optical (RI) and near-infrared (JHK ) period
luminosity metallicity helium relations. Interestingly enough, the increase in
He content causes a minimal change in the coefficients of both period and
metallicity terms, since canonical and He-enhanced models obey similar PLZ
relations. On the contrary, the classical B and V band mean magnitude
metallicity relations and the R band PLZ relation display a significant
dependence on the He content. The He enhanced models are, at fixed metal
content, 0.2 to 0.5 mag brighter than canonical ones. This variation is only
marginally affected by evolutionary effects. The quoted distance diagnostics
once calibrated with trigonometric parallaxes (Gaia) will provide the
opportunity to estimate the He content of field and cluster RRLs. Moreover, the

the worst-case estimates of the length of the longest increasing trail/path

still widely open. Recently Lavrov and Loh proposed to study the average case
of this problem in which the edge ordering is chosen uniformly at random. They
conjectured (and it was proved by Martinsson) that such an ordering with high

  In this paper we consider random graph $G=G(n,p)$ and its edge ordering
chosen uniformly at random. In this setting we determine whp the asymptotics of

the variational principle to become well-posed, beside the canonical structure

how one can remove the restrictions imposed on the metric variations in

after carefully chosen the inner parameters of the system, by turning on an
external magnetic field we can find spin and energy currents propagating in
different directions. More interestingly, we may find cases in which
rectifications of the energy and of the spin currents occur in opposite
directions, i.e., if the energy current is larger when flowing from left to
right side, then the spin current is larger if it flows from the right to left

understanding, which aims to identify mentions of named entities in text e.g.,

dedicated word-level representations, which suffer from two main shortcomings.
First, the vocabulary size is large, yielding large memory requirements and
training time. Second, these models are not able to learn morphological or
phonological representations. To remedy the above shortcomings, we adopt a
neural solution based on bidirectional LSTMs and conditional random fields,
where we rely on subword units, namely characters, phonemes, and bytes. For
each word in an utterance, our model learns a representation from each of the
subword units. We conducted experiments in a real-world large-scale setting for
the use case of a voice-controlled device covering four languages with up to
5.5M utterances per language. Our experiments show that (1) with increasing
training data, performance of models trained solely on subword units becomes
closer to that of models with dedicated word-level embeddings (91.35 vs 93.92
F1 for English), while using a much smaller vocabulary size (332 vs 74K), (2)
subword units enhance models with dedicated word-level embeddings, and (3)
combining different subword units improves performance.

excited states, thereby suppressing the dielectronic recombination rate. The
improved suppression factors presented here, although highly approximate, allow
summed recombination rate coefficients to be used to intermediate densities.
There have been several technical improvements to our previously presented
fits. For H- through B-like ions the activation log densities have been
adjusted to better reproduce existing data. For B-, C-, Al-, and Si-like ions
secondary autoionization is now included. The treatment of density
discontinuity in electron excitations out of ground state H-, He-, and Ne-like

jets differ significantly from one another and appear to asymptote to different

model to investigate the origin of the difference between the observed
suppression of jets and hadrons and relate it, quantitatively, to the observed
modification of the jet fragmentation function in jets that have been modified
by passage through the medium produced in heavy ion collisions. In particular,
the observed increase in the fraction of hard fragments in medium-modified
jets, which indicates that jets with the fewest hardest fragments lose the
least energy, corresponds quantitatively to the observed difference between the
suppression of hadrons and jets. We argue that a harder fragmentation pattern
for jets with a given energy after quenching is a generic feature of any
mechanism for the interaction between jets and the medium that they traverse
that yields a larger suppression for wider jets. We also compare the results of
our global fit to LHC data to measurements of the suppression of high energy
hadrons in RHIC collisions, and find that with its parameter chosen to fit the

phoretic far-field interactions to a pair-interaction whose strength is mainly
controlled by one genuine parameter (swimming speed). The model suggests that
phoretic interactions are generically important for autophoretic colloids

dominate over hydrodynamic interactions for the typical case of half-coating

dynamic clustering in active colloids at low density. This suggests that
dynamic clustering can emerge from the interplay of screened phoretic

composition using up-to-date stellar evolution models. We simulate the
evolution of pre-main-sequence stars as a function of the efficiency of heat
injection during accretion, the deuterium mass fraction, and the stellar mass.
For simplicity, we assume that planet formation leads to the late accretion of
zero-metallicity gas, diluting the surface stellar composition as a function of
the mass of the stellar outer convective zone. We adopt
$150\,{\mathrm{M}_\oplus}(M_\star/\mathrm{M}_\odot)(Z/\mathrm{Z}_\odot)$ as an
uncertain but plausible estimate of the mass of heavy elements that is not
accreted by stars with giant planets, including our Sun. By combining our
stellar evolution models to these estimates, we evaluate the consequences of
planet formation on stellar surface composition. We show that after the first
$\sim0.1$ Myr, the evolution of the convective zone follows classical
evolutionary tracks within a factor of two in age. We find that planet
formation should lead to a scatter in stellar surface composition that is
larger for high-mass stars than for low-mass stars. We predict a spread in
[Fe/H] of approximately $0.02$ dex for stars with $T_\mathrm{eff}\sim 5500\,$K,
marginally compatible with differences in metallicities observed in some binary
stars with planets. Stars with $T_\mathrm{eff}\geq 7000\,$K may show much
larger [Fe/H] deficits, by 0.6 dex or more, compatible with the existence of
refractory-poor $\lambda$ Boo stars. We also find that planet formation may
explain the lack of refractory elements seen in the Sun as compared to solar
twins, but only if the ice-to-rock ratio in the solar-system planets is less
than $\approx0.4$ and planet formation began less than $\approx1.3$ Myr after

assuming that the tori is a linear media, making it is possible to characterize
the magnetic polarization of the fluid through the magnetic susceptibility
$\chi_{m}$. The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) structure of the models was solved by
following the Komissarov approach, but with the aim of including the magnetic
polarization of the fluid, the integrability condition for the magnetic
counterpart was modified. We build two kinds of magnetized tori depending on
whether the magnetic susceptibility is constant in space or not. In the models
with constant $\chi_{m}$, we find that the paramagnetic tori ($\chi_{m}>0$) are
more dense and less magnetized than the diamagnetic ones ($\chi_{m}<0$) in the
region between the inner edge, $r_{in}$, and the center of the disk, $r_{c}$;
however, we find the opposite behavior for $r>r_{c}$. Now, in the models with
non-constant $\chi_{m}$, the tori become more magnetized than the Komissarov
solution in the region where $\partial\chi_{m}/\partial r<0$, and less
magnetized when $\partial\chi_{m}/\partial r>0$. Nevertheless, it is worth
mentioning that in all solutions presented in this paper the magnetic pressure
is greater than the hydrodynamic pressure. These new equilibrium tori can be
useful for studying the accretion of a magnetic media onto a rotating black

show that the energy oscillations of the MBSs can show very different behavior

oscillations amplitudes and decreasing periods, while in the other regimes the
complete opposite behavior is found with increasing magnetic field strength. We
also find that the topological phase can become dependent on the chain length,

everywhere. The proof involves interpolation of the discrete process and
analysis of the limiting semigroup of the evolution. In order to identify the
limit, we use the theories of dimer models as well as Hamilton-Jacobi
equations.
  It seems that our result is the first example in $d>1$ where such a full
hydrodynamic limit with a nonconvex Hamiltonian can be obtained for a discrete
system. We also define the shuffling height process for more general periodic
dimer models, where we expect similar results to hold.

window of the width $s$ in their common boundary are calculated under the
assumption that the transverse electric field $\pmb{\mathscr{E}}$ is applied to
the structure. It is shown that the increase of the electric intensity brings
closer to each other fundamental propagation thresholds of the opening and the

at any nonzero $s$, exhibits the energy $E_0$ decrease for the growing
$\mathscr{E}$ and in the high-field regime $E_0$ stays practically the same
regardless of the size of the connecting region. It is predicted that the
critical window widths $s_{cr_n}$, $n=1,2,\ldots$, at which new excited
localized orbitals emerge, strongly depend on the transverse voltage; in
particular, the field leads to the increase of $s_{cr_n}$, and, for quite
strong electric intensities, the critical width unrestrictedly diverges. This
remarkable feature of the electric-field-induced switching of the bound states
can be checked, for example, by the change of the optical properties of the

strength and absorption spectrum exhibit a conspicuous maximum on their
$\mathscr{E}$ dependence and turn to zero when the electric intensity reaches
its critical value. Comparative analysis of the two-dimensional (2D) and 3D

performance but bring expensive computation cost. Accelerating such
over-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical
pruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and
retraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during
retraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they
directly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause
unrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an
Asymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference
procedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters
during the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned
model would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In
this way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.
Second, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and
asymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With
asymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually
concentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning
process would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on
image classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more
than 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which
is higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.

over a wide range. Studying density dependence of symmetry energy is thus a
major topic of research in nuclear physics. Density dependence of symmetry
energy is primarily characterized by three empirical quantities defined for
infinite nuclear matter namely, symmetry energy coefficient J, slope parameter
L and curvature parameter K_sym ; all of these quantities pertaining to
saturation density \rho_0 of infinite nuclear matter. Since nuclear matter is

associated effective stress-stiffening is disconnected from actual
stress-induced changes of the elastic modulus and should therefore be regarded
as an apparent stiffening of the material. We argue that new approaches in

we have solved an old problem stated in [Calvanese, De Giacomo, Lenzerini,
Vardi, SPDS ACM, 2000] showing that query determinacy is undecidable for
Regular Path Queries. Here a strong generalisation of this result is shown, and
-- we think -- a very unexpected one. We prove that no regularity is needed:
determinacy remains undecidable even for finite unions of conjunctive path
queries.

step toward further analysis such as cell counting, cell segmentation, study of
cell connections, etc. This is a challenging task due to the complex texture of
histology image, variation in shape, and touching cells. To tackle these
hurdles, many approaches have been proposed in the literature where deep
learning methods stand on top in terms of performance. Hence, in this paper, we
propose a novel framework for nuclei detection based on Mixture Density
Networks (MDNs). These networks are suitable to map a single input to several
possible outputs and we utilize this property to detect multiple seeds in a
single image patch. A new modified form of a cost function is proposed for
training and handling patches with missing nuclei. The probability maps of the
nuclei in the individual patches are next combined to generate the final
image-wide result. The experimental results show the state-of-the-art
performance on complex colorectal adenocarcinoma dataset.

because of their varying sizes and appearances. We propose a novel weakly
supervised method to localize chest pathologies using class aware deep
multiscale feature learning. Our method leverages intermediate feature maps
from CNN layers at different stages of a deep network during the training of a
classification model using image level annotations of pathologies. During the
training phase, a set of \emph{layer relevance weights} are learned for each
pathology class and the CNN is optimized to perform pathology classification by
convex combination of feature maps from both shallow and deep layers using the
learned weights. During the test phase, to localize the predicted pathology,
the multiscale attention map is obtained by convex combination of class
activation maps from each stage using the \emph{layer relevance weights}
learned during the training phase. We have validated our method using 112000
X-ray images and compared with the state-of-the-art localization methods. We
experimentally demonstrate that the proposed weakly supervised method can
improve the localization performance of small pathologies such as nodule and
mass while giving comparable performance for bigger pathologies e.g.,

mechanics. We believe the instant correlation between entangled distant quantum
particles can be explained by the fact that in a laboratory reference frame the
photon traveling duration is positive and finite while its proper (in vacuum)
traveling duration is equal to zero. In the latter case, any two events that
are separated (in a laboratory reference frame) by an arbitrary finite distance
can be considered as simultaneous ones. So, the photon nonlocal correlation
turns out to be a relative property and may be explained like known twins
paradox in relativity. In such a situation, any standard causal interaction
between the correlated particles is absent in a laboratory reference frame;
however, some specific mutual couple appears between them; this couple is
strictly oscillating without some oriented energy or/and information
transferring. We also motivate the basic hypothesis extension on quantum
particles having nonzero masses.

regularization of steadily-moving straight dislocations of arbitrary
orientation is introduced, with two scale parameters $a_\parallel$ and
$a_\perp$ along the direction of motion and transverse to it, respectively. The
dislocation core shape is an ellipse. When $a_\perp/a_\parallel\to 0$, the
model reduces to the Peierls-Eshelby dislocation, the fields of which are
non-differentiable on the slip plane. For finite $a_\parallel$ and $a_\perp$,
fields are everywhere differentiable. Applying the author's so-called `causal'
Stroh formalism to the model, explicit expressions for the regularized fields
in anisotropic elasticity are derived for any velocity. For faster-than-wave
velocities, Mach-cone angles are found insensitive to the ratio
$a_\parallel/a_\perp$, as must be. However, the larger $a_\parallel$, the
weaker the intensity of the cone branches. An expression is given for the
radiative dissipative force opposed to motion. From this expression, it is
inferred that the concept of a `radiation-free' intersonic velocity can, when
not applicable, be replaced by that of a `least-radiation' velocity.

focusing of elastic guided waves in a free-standing plate with a step-like
thickness change. Under certain conditions, a positive phase velocity (forward)
Lamb mode can be converted into a negative phase velocity (backward) mode at
such interface, giving rise to negative refraction. A semi-analytical model is
developed in order to study the influence of various parameters such as the
material Poisson's coefficient, the step-like thickness, the frequency and the
incidence angle. To this end, all the Lamb and shear horizontal propagating
modes, but also a large number of their inhomogeneous and evanescent
counterpart,s are taken into account. The boundary conditions applied to the
stress-displacement fields at the thickness step yields an equation system. Its
inversion provides the transmission and reflection coefficients between each
mode at the interface. The step-like thickness and Poisson's ratio are shown to
be key parameters to optimize the negative refraction process. In terms of
material, Duralumin is found to be optimal as it leads to a nearly perfect
conversion between forward and backward modes over broad frequency and angular
ranges. An excellent focusing ability is thus predicted for a flat lens made of
two symmetric thickness steps. Theoretical results are confirmed by a numerical
FDTD simulation and experimental measurements made on an optimized Duralumin
flat lens by means of laser interferometry. This theoretical study paves the
way towards the optimization of elastic devices based on negative refraction,
in particular for cloaking or super-focusing purposes.
