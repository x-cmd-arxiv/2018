class-related representations. The second branch is fully unsupervised and
dedicated to model information discarded by the first branch to reconstruct
input data. To further support the expected behavior of our model, we propose
an original training objective. It favors stability in the discriminative
branch and complementarity between the learned representations in the two

visualizations and ablation studies validate our contributions and the behavior

of its normal closure is a semidirect product $C_{p^n}\rtimes C_D$ of the

$p$. We characterize the transitive groups of degree $p^3$ which are Galois
groups of the normal closure of a separable field extension having some cyclic
Hopf Galois structure and determine the number of those. We prove that if a
separable field extension of degree $p^3$ has a nonabelian Hopf Galois

the nonabelian type. We obtain that, for $p>3$, the two abelian noncyclic Hopf

We present a table which gives the number of Hopf Galois structures of each
possible type on a separable extension of degree $27$ to illustrate that for

viscosity ($\alpha_B$), accretion rate (${\dot m}$) and plasma-$\beta$,
respectively. In the rotating magnetized accretion flow, centrifugal barrier is
developed in the nearby region of the black hole that triggers the
discontinuous shock transition in the flow variables. Evidently, the shock
properties and the dynamics of the post-shock flow (hereafter post-shock corona
(PSC)) are being governed by the flow parameters. We study the role of
dissipation parameters in the formation of standing shock wave and find that
global shocked accretion solutions exist both in gas pressure dominated flows
and in magnetic pressure dominated flows. In addition, we observe that standing
shock continues to form around the rapidly rotating black holes as well. We
identify the range of dissipation parameters that permits shocked accretion
solutions and find that standing shocks continue to form even in presence of
high dissipation limit, although the likelihood of shock formation diminishes
with the increase of dissipation. Further, we compute the critical accretion
rate (${\dot m}^{\rm cri}$) that admits shock and observe that standing shock
exists in a magnetically dominated accretion flow when the accretion rate lies

granulation is corrugated and the granules can block other granules, as well as
the intergranular lane components. Overall, the visible plasma flows and

C*-correspondences, including all regular ones, are shown to be hyperrigid.
Using Hamana's injective envelope theory, we extend earlier results from the
discrete group case to arbitrary locally compact groups; this includes a
resolution of the Hao-Ng isomorphism for the reduced crossed product and all
hyperrigid C*-correspondences. A culmination of these results is the resolution
of the Hao-Ng isomorphism problem for the full crossed product and all
row-finite graph correspondences; this extends a recent result of Bedos,
Kaliszewski, Quigg and Spielberg.

to the strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI), and the role of diverse multipole
fluctuations on the pairing mechanism attracts a lot of attention. Here, we
study a mechanism of superconductivity in heavy fermion systems, by focusing on
the impact of vertex corrections (VCs) for the pairing interaction going beyond
the Migdal approximation. In heavy fermion systems, strong interference between
multipole fluctuations cause significant VCs, that represent many-body effects
beyond mean-field-type approximations. Especially, the coupling constants
between electrons and charged-bosons, including the electron-phonon coupling
constant, are strongly magnified by the VCs. For this reason, moderate
even-rank (=electric) multipole fluctuations give large attractive interaction,
and therefore s-wave superconductivity can emerge in heavy-fermion systems. In
particular, phonon-mediated superconductivity is expected to be realized near
the magnetic criticality, thanks to the VCs due to magnetic multipole
fluctuations. The present mechanism may be responsible for the fully gapped
s-wave superconducting state realized in CeCu2Si2.

better performances than the two-part structure of traditional machine learning
methods. However, there are still two problems to be resolved: cutting down
signal to noise ratio of the steganalysis feature map and steganalyzing images
of arbitrary size. Some algorithms required fixed size images as the input and
had low accuracy due to the underutilization of the noise residuals obtained by
various types of filters. In this paper, we focus on designing an improved
network structure based on CNN to resolve the above problems. First, we use 3x3
kernels instead of the traditional 5x5 kernels and optimize convolution kernels
in the preprocessing layer. The smaller convolution kernels are used to reduce
the number of parameters and model the features in a small local region. Next,
we use separable convolutions to utilize channel correlation of the residuals,
compress the image content and increase the signal-to-noise ratio (between the
stego signal and the image signal). Then, we use spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)
to aggregate the local features, enhance the representation ability of
features, and steganalyze arbitrary size image. Finally, data augmentation is
adopted to further improve network performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed CNN structure is significantly better than other four methods
such as SRM, Ye-Net, Xu-Net, and Yedroudj-Net, when it is used to detect two
spatial algorithms such as WOW and S-UNIWARAD with a wide variety of datasets

interacting with the vacuum electromagnetic field, during a nonequilibrium

two atoms prepared in a correlated, symmetric or antisymmetric, state. Since
the atoms start from a nonequilibrium conditions, their interaction energy is
time dependent. We obtain, at second order in the atom-field coupling, an
analytic expression for the time-dependent resonance interaction energy between
the atoms. We show that this interaction vanishes when the two atoms are
outside the light-cone of each other, in agreement with relativistic causality,
while it instantaneously settles to its stationary value after time $t=R/c$

of our two-atom system. We show that the field energy density vanishes in
points outside the light-cone of both atoms, thus preserving relativistic
causality. On the other hand, inside the light-cone of both atoms, the energy
density instantaneously settles to its stationary value. Specifically, for
points at equal distance from the two atoms, we find that it vanishes if the
two atoms are prepared in the antisymmetric (subradiant) state, while it is
enhanced, with respect to the case of atoms in a factorized state, in the

information on the perpendicular domain phase that is stabilized by dipole
interactions, the transitions to or from the domain phase are subtle and
difficult to characterize experimentally. Magnetic susceptibility measurements
show no divergence in the vicinity of the spin-reorientation transition as a
function of thickness -- a null result that is difficult to interpret with
confidence. This article reports separate dynamical and equilibrium versions of
the reorientation transition in Fe/2ML Ni/W(110) films, using measurements of

occurs when increasing the film thickness causes the domain walls to depin, and
the system moves from a configuration that minimizes local energetics to one
that minimizes global energetics. The dynamical transition \textit{is} marked
by a divergent magnetic susceptibility measured with a field applied along the
in-plane W[001] direction. A comparative study of the two versions of the same
spin-reorientation transition aids in the experimental characterization of the
effects of dipole interactions on the phase transitions. This comparison
confirms the original null result found in magnetic susceptibility measurements

performance drop due to distribution mismatch is often encountered in the real

been proposed to mitigate the performance drop. However, very little attention
has been made toward leveraging information in videos which are naturally
captured in most camera systems. In this work, we propose to leverage ""motion
prior"" in videos for improving human segmentation in a weakly-supervised active

videos, we can extract candidate foreground motion segments (referred to as
motion prior) potentially corresponding to human segments. We propose to learn
a memory-network-based policy model to select strong candidate segments
(referred to as strong motion prior) through reinforcement learning. The
selected segments have high precision and are directly used to finetune the
model. In a newly collected surveillance camera dataset and a publicly
available UrbanStreet dataset, our proposed method improves the performance of
human segmentation across multiple scenes and modalities (i.e., RGB to Infrared

domain adaptation approaches such that additional performance gain is achieved
by combining our weakly-supervised active learning approach with domain

timescales ranging from a few hours up to a few days. Some of this variability
may be associated with occultation events by clouds in the broad line region.
In this work, we aim to model the spectral and polarization variability arising
from X-ray obscuration events, serving as probes of the relativistic effects
that dominate the emission from the innermost regions. We show that asymmetries
can be clearly detected in the AGN spectra as the cloud is shading different
parts of the accretion disc. We also show that these effects can be detected in
the temporal evolution of the polarization degree ($P$) and the polarization
position angle ($\Psi$). The variations in $P$ and $\Psi$ are highly dependent
on the inclination of the system, the position of the primary source and its
intrinsic polarization. Considering the disc-corona system only, for an
inclination $\theta = 30^\circ$ (60$^\circ$), $P$ increases up to $\sim 20$%
(30)%, in the 4-8 keV band, when the unpolarized primary source is obscured.
However, after accounting for the contribution of parsec-scale material
scattering the light in our line of sight (narrow-line region and molecular
torus), the variability is smoothed out and the polarization degree can be
reduced down to $\sim 1$% (2%). Our results suggest that the study of eclipses

the limitation to 2.5D simulations and the especially use of Hydrogen plasma as
a propellant, whose element is rarely considered in the real scenario. Also,
the analysis mainly focussed on studying the physical content of the outcomes,
by leaving out the analysis of more important engineering quantities, such as
the mass flow and thrust effectively reached out of such systems. With this
work, we intend to fill these gaps in order to provide further insights into
the great potentiality of a future technology based on magnetic reconnection.
Additionally, one of the possibly limiting features was the inevitable
symmetric outflow produced by the reconnection process. Among all the possible

self-energy corrections of individual Kohn-Sham states, and thus the $G_0W_0$
band structure is distinctively different from its DFT counterpart, i.e.,
many-body effects cannot be regarded as a rigid shift of the conduction bands.
We explore the nature of the optical excitations at the interface over a wide
energy range and show that various kinds of electron-hole pairs are formed,
comprising hybrid excitons and (hybrid) charge-transfer excitations. The
absorption onset is characterized by a strongly bound bright ZnO-dominated
hybrid exciton. For selected examples of either exciton type, we analyze the
individual contributions from the valence and conduction bands and discuss the
binding strength and extension of the electron-hole wavefunctions.

which was observed simultaneously by XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. The 0.7-2 keV FFPs
show a non-linear behaviour, while they are well fitted by a straight line, in
the $\sim 2-40$ keV range. Without any additional modelling, this result
strongly suggests that neither absorption nor spectral slope variations can
contribute significantly to the observed variability above 2 keV (on time
scales $\lesssim$5 days, at least). The FFP method is capable of separating the
variable and the constant X-ray spectral components in this source. We found
that the low-, average- and high-flux spectra of the variable components are
consistent with a power law varying in normalisation only plus a relativistic
reflection component varying simultaneously with the continuum. At low
energies, we identify an additional variable component, consistent with a
neutral absorber with a variable covering fraction. We also detect two spectral
components whose fluxes remain constant over the duration of the observations.
These components can be well described by a blackbody emission of $kT_{\rm
BB}\sim 0.18\, \rm keV$, dominating at soft X-rays, and a reflection component
from neutral material. The spectral model resulting from the FFP analysis can
fit well the energy spectra of the source. We suggest that a combined study of
FFPs and energy spectra in the case of X-ray bright and variable Seyferts can
identify, unambiguously, the various spectral components, and can lift the
degeneracy that is often observed within different models fitting equally well
time-averaged spectra of these objects.

growth rate and the neutral curve of the two types of instabilities: (i) the
Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) wave and (ii) the Coriolis force-driven instability.
We report the existence of four distinct unstable modes (Modes I-IV) at low
Reynolds numbers of which only the existence of Mode I is previously known for
the present flow configuration. Furthermore, Modes I and II exhibit competing
characteristics. We infer that Modes III and IV might cause strong mixing
locally by virtue of strong velocity perturbation in proximity to the
interface. We quantify the potential of all the modes to induce such localized
mixing near the interface using the notion of penetration depth. Further,
insight into the mechanism of energy transfer, drawn from the evaluation of
kinetic-energy budget, reveals that the Reynolds stress first transfers energy
from the mean flow to the streamwise velocity fluctuations. The Coriolis force,
thereafter, redistributes the axial momentum into spanwise and wall-normal
directions, generating the frequently observed roll-cell structures. A
qualitative comparison of our predictions with reported experiments on
roll-cells indicates co-existence of Modes I and II.

theories are built for rigorously analyzing the positivity-preserving (PP)
property of MHD schemes with a HLL type flux on polytopal meshes in any space
dimension. The main challenges overcome here include establishing relation
between the PP property and discrete divergence of magnetic field on general
meshes, and estimating proper wave speeds in the HLL flux to ensure the PP
property. In 1D case, we prove that the standard DG and finite volume methods
with the proposed HLL flux are PP, under condition accessible by a PP limiter.
For multidimensional conservative MHD system, standard DG methods with a PP
limiter are not PP in general, due to the effect of unavoidable
divergence-error. We construct provably PP high-order DG and finite volume
schemes by proper discretization of symmetrizable MHD system, with two
divergence-controlling techniques: locally divergence-free elements and a
penalty term. The former leads to zero divergence within each cell, while the
latter controls the divergence error across cell interfaces. Our analysis
reveals that a coupling of them is important for positivity preservation, as
they exactly contribute the discrete divergence-terms absent in standard DG
schemes but crucial for ensuring the PP property. Numerical tests confirm the
PP property and the effectiveness of proposed PP schemes. Unlike conservative
MHD system, the exact smooth solutions of symmetrizable MHD system are proved
to retain the positivity even if the divergence-free condition is not
satisfied. Our analysis and findings further the understanding, at both

theory with a global symmetry, then apply the ""gauge principle,"" which demands
that this symmetry hold locally. For example, the global phase rotation of a
system of conserved charges can be promoted to a local phase rotation by
coupling to an ordinary U(1) vector gauge field. More recently, a class of
particles has been studied featuring not only charge conservation, but also
conservation of higher moments, such as dipole moment, which leads to severe
restrictions on the mobility of charges. These particles, called fractons, are
known to be intimately connected to symmetric tensor gauge fields. In this
work, we show how to derive such tensor gauge theories by applying the gauge
principle to a theory of ungauged fractons. We begin by formulating a field
theory for ungauged fractons exhibiting global conservation of charge and
dipole moment. We show that such fracton field theories have a characteristic
non-Gaussian form, reflecting the fact that fractons intrinsically interact
with each other even in the absence of a mediating gauge field. We then promote
the global higher moment conservation laws to local ones, which requires the
introduction of a symmetric tensor gauge field. Finally, we extend these
arguments to other types of subdimensional particles besides fractons. This
work offers a possible route to the formulation of non-abelian fracton
theories.

jets in a global framework. Foregoing the commonly invoked force-free limit, we
focus on the small-scale, internal instabilities triggered in regions of the
jet dominated by a toroidal magnetic field, with a weak vertical field and
finite thermal pressure gradient. Such regions are likely to occur far from the
jet source and boundaries, and are potential sites of magnetic energy
dissipation that is essential to explain the particle acceleration and
radiation observed from astrophysical jets. We validate the local stability
analysis of Begelman by verifying that the eigenfunctions of the most unstable
modes are radially localized. This finding allows us to propose a generic
stability criterion in the presence of a weak vertical field. A stronger
vertical field with a radial gradient complicates the stability criterion, due
to the competition between the destabilizing thermal pressure gradient and
stabilizing magnetic pressure gradients. Nevertheless, we argue that the jet
interiors generically should be subject to rapidly growing, small-scale
instabilities, capable of producing current sheets that lead to dissipation. We
identify some new instabilities, not predicted by the local analysis, which are
sensitive to the background radial profiles but have smaller growth rates than
the local instabilities, and discuss the relevance of our work to the findings
of recent numerical jet simulations.

modest in PG 2308+098. By compiling literature values of the disk size

spectrum is sensitive to DM-baryon scattering if the fraction of interacting DM
is larger than (or comparable to) the fractional uncertainty in the baryon
energy density. Meanwhile, there is a mass-dependent lower limit on the
fraction for which the required interaction to cool the baryons sufficiently is
so strong that it drives the interacting-DM temperature to the baryon
temperature prior to their decoupling from the CMB. If this occurs as early as
recombination, the cooling saturates. We precisely determine the viable
parameter space for millicharged DM, and find that only a fraction (m_chi/MeV)
0.0115% <~ f <~ 0.4% of the entire DM content, and only for DM-particle masses
between 0.5 MeV - 35 MeV, can be charged at the level needed to marginally
explain the anomaly, without violating limits from SLAC, CMB, Big-Bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN), or stellar and SN1987A cooling. In reality, though, we
demonstrate that at least moderate fine tuning is required to both agree with
the measured absorption profile and overcome various astrophysical sources of
heating. Finally, we point out that a ~0.4% millicharged DM component which is
tightly coupled to the baryons at recombination may resolve the current 2-sigma
tension between the BBN and CMB determinations of the baryon energy density.

entanglement costs of encoding and decoding quantum information in a

effect in the electric dipole moment (EDM) $d_\mu$ as well. In this context it
has often been argued that in UV complete models the electron EDM, which is
very precisely measured, excludes a large effect in $d_\mu$. However, the
recently observed 2.5$\sigma$ tension in $a_e=(g-2)_e/2$, if confirmed,
requires that the muon and electron sectors effectively decouple to avoid
constraints from $\mu\to e\gamma$. We briefly discuss UV complete models that
possess such a decoupling, which can be enforced by an Abelian flavor symmetry
$L_\mu-L_\tau$. We show that, in such scenarios, there is no reason to expect a
correlation between the electron and muon EDM, so that the latter can be
sizable. New limits on $d_\mu$ improved by up to two orders of magnitude are
expected from the upcoming $(g-2)_\mu$ experiments at Fermilab and J-PARC.
Beyond, a proposed dedicated muon EDM experiment at PSI could further advance
the limit. In this way, future improved measurements of $a_e$, $a_\mu$, as well
as the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ are not only set to provide exciting
precision tests of the SM, but, in combination with EDMs, to reveal crucial
insights into the flavor structure of physics beyond the SM.

existence of quantum circuits that renormalize entanglement in real space at
different length scales. Chern insulators, however, cannot have scale-invariant
discrete MERA circuits with finite bond dimension. In this Letter, we show that
the continuous MERA (cMERA), a modified version of MERA adapted for field
theories, possesses a fixed point wavefunction with nonzero Chern number.
Additionally, it is well known that reversed MERA circuits can be used to
prepare quantum states efficiently in time that scales logarithmically with the
size of the system. However, state preparation via MERA typically requires the
advent of a full-fledged universal quantum computer. In this Letter, we
demonstrate that our cMERA circuit can potentially be realized in existing
analog quantum computers, i.e., an ultracold atomic Fermi gas in an optical
lattice with light-induced spin-orbit coupling.

one of the ingredients for a NNLL accurate parton shower algorithm. As an
application we obtain analytic NNLL results, of which several are new, for all
angularities $\tau_x$ defined with respect to both the thrust axis and the

intracluster light (ICL). In this work, we compare the bi-dimensional
distribution of dark matter in massive galaxy clusters (as traced by
gravitational lensing models) with the distribution of the ICL. To do that, we
use the superb data from the Hubble Frontier Fields Initiative. Using the
Modified Hausdorff distance (MHD) as a way of quantifying the similarities
between the mass and ICL distributions, we find an excellent agreement (MHD~25
kpc) between the two components. This result shows that the ICL exquisitely
follows the global dark matter distribution, providing an accurate luminous
tracer of dark matter. This finding opens up the possibility of exploring the
distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters in detail using only deep

astrophysical transients including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), core-collapse
supernovae with choked jets and neutron star mergers. IceCube's optical and
X-ray follow-up program searches for such transient sources by looking for two
or more muon neutrino candidates in directional coincidence and arriving within
100s. The measured rate of neutrino alerts is consistent with the expected rate
of chance coincidences of atmospheric background events and no likely
electromagnetic counterparts have been identified in Swift follow-up
observations. Here, we calculate generic bounds on the neutrino flux of
short-lived transient sources. Assuming an $E^{-2.5}$ neutrino spectrum, we
find that the neutrino flux of rare sources, like long gamma-ray bursts, is
constrained to <5% of the detected astrophysical flux and the energy released
in neutrinos (100GeV to 10PeV) by a median bright GRB-like source is
$<10^{52.5}$erg. For a harder $E^{-2.13}$ neutrino spectrum up to 30% of the
flux could be produced by GRBs and the allowed median source energy is $<
10^{52}$erg. A hypothetical population of transient sources has to be more
common than $10^{-5}\text{Mpc}^{-3}\text{yr}^{-1}$
($5\times10^{-8}\text{Mpc}^{-3}\text{yr}^{-1}$ for the $E^{-2.13}$ spectrum) to
account for the complete astrophysical neutrino flux.

a powerful probe of the neutral gas content of the universe. This radio
frequency transition has been used routinely for decades to observe, both in
emission and absorption, HI in the Galactic interstellar medium as well as in
extragalactic sources. In general, however, it is not trivial to derive the
physically relevant parameters like temperature, density or column density from
these observations. Here, we have considered the issue of column density
estimation from the HI 21 cm emission spectrum for sightlines with a
non-negligible optical depth and a mix of gas at different temperatures. The
complicated radiative transfer and a lack of knowledge about the relative
position of gas clouds along the sightline often make it impossible to uniquely
separate the components, and hinders reliable estimation of column densities in
such cases. Based on the observed correlation between the 21 cm brightness
temperature and optical depth, we propose a method to get an unbiased estimate

space formalism. We define a covariant phase space and compute the algebra of
symmetries at the null boundary by considering the boundary-preserving
diffeomorphisms that preserve this phase space. This algebra is the semi-direct
sum of diffeomorphisms on the two sphere and a nonabelian algebra of
supertranslations that has some similarities to supertranslations at null
infinity. By using the general prescription developed by Wald and Zoupas, we
derive the localized charges of this algebra at cross sections of the null
surface as well as the associated fluxes. Our analysis is covariant and applies
to general non-stationary null surfaces. We also derive the global charges that
generate the symmetries for event horizons, and show that these obey the same
algebra as the linearized diffeomorphisms, without any central extension. Our
results show that supertranslations play an important role not just at null
infinity but at all null boundaries, including non-stationary event horizons.
They should facilitate further investigations of whether horizon symmetries and
conservation laws in black hole spacetimes play a role in the information loss
problem, as suggested by Hawking, Perry, and Strominger.

4.5um using Spitzer/IRAC. The CWW 89 binary system is a member of the
$3.0\pm0.25$ Gyr-old open cluster Ruprecht 147, and is composed of a Sun-like
primary and an early M-dwarf secondary separated by a projected distance of 25
AU. CWW 89Ab has a radius of $0.937\pm0.042$ RJ and a mass of $36.5\pm0.1$ MJ,
and is on a 5.3 day orbit about CWW 89A with a non-zero eccentricity of
$e=0.19$ (Curtis et al. 2016). We strongly detect the eclipses of CWW 89Ab in
both Spitzer channels as $\delta_{3.6}=1147\pm213$ ppm and
$\delta_{4.5}=1097\pm225$ ppm after correcting for the dilution from CWW 89B.
After accounting for the irradiation that CWW 89Ab receives from its host star,
these measurements imply that the brown dwarf has an internal luminosity of
$\log(\mathrm{L_{bol}/\mathrm{L}_\odot})=-4.19\pm0.14$. This is 16 times, or
$9.3\,\sigma$, higher than model predictions given the known mass, radius, and
age of CWW 89Ab. As we discuss, this over-luminosity is not explainable by an
inaccurate age determination, additional stellar heating, nor tidal heating.
Instead, we suggest that the anomalous luminosity of CWW 89Ab is caused by a
dayside temperature inversion -- though a significant error in the evolutionary
models is also a possibility. Importantly, a temperature inversion would
require a super-stellar C/O ratio in CWW 89Ab's atmosphere. If this is indeed
the case, it implies that CWW 89Ab is a 36.5 MJ object that formed via core
accretion processes. Finally, we use our measurement of CWW 89Ab's orbital
eccentricity, improved via these observations, to constrain the tidal quality
factors of the brown dwarf and the host star CWW 89A to be $Q_{BD}>10^{4.15}$
and $Q_*>10^{9}$, respectively.

velocity fields are found to show detectable deviations from uniform coplanar
circular motion, although most of these variations are symmetric about the
center of the galaxy. The behavior of gas and stellar velocity fields is
largely independent, even when PA_k profiles for both components are measured
over the same radii. We present evidence that one class of symmetric PA_k
variations is likely associated with bars and/or oval distortions, while
another class is more consistent with warped disks. This analysis sets the

screening leads to gaps in coverage. We discuss how screening can turn
fundamentally equivalence principle (EP)-preserving forces into EP-violating

required in all galaxy evolution simulations due to the ubiquity of turbulence

Smagorinsky model, is known to be over-diffusive due to its strong dependence
on the fluid velocity shear. We present a method for dynamically calculating a
more accurate, locally appropriate, turbulent diffusivity: the dynamic
localised Smagorinsky model. We investigate a set of standard
astrophysically-relevant hydrodynamical tests, and demonstrate that the dynamic
model curbs over-diffusion in non-turbulent shear flows and improves the
density contrast in our driven turbulence experiments. In galactic discs, we
find that the dynamic model maintains the stability of the disc by preventing
excessive angular momentum transport, and increases the metal-mixing timescale
in the interstellar medium. In both our isolated Milky Way-like galaxies and
cosmological simulations, we find that the interstellar and circumgalactic
media are particularly sensitive to the treatment of turbulent diffusion. We
also examined the global gas enrichment fractions in our cosmological
simulations, to gauge the potential effect on the formation sites and
population statistics of Population III stars and supermassive black holes,
since they are theorised to be sensitive to the metallicity of the gas out of

hypercharge interactions. We consider the custodial-symmetric GM model to arise
at some high scale as a result of an unspecified ultraviolet completion, and
quantify the custodial symmetry violation induced as the model is run down to
the weak scale. The measured value of the eletroweak rho parameter (along with
unitarity considerations) lets us constrain the scale of the ultraviolet
completion to lie below tens to hundreds of TeV. Subject to this constraint, we
quantify the size of other custodial-symmetry-violating effects at the weak

supergiants. They undergo extreme, irregular declines in brightness of many
magnitudes due to the formation of thick clouds of carbon dust. It is thought
that RCB stars result from the mergers of CO/He white dwarf (WD) binaries. We
constructed post--merger spherically asymmetric models computed with the MESA
code, and then followed the evolution into the region of the HR diagram where
the RCB stars are located. We also investigated nucleosynthesis in the
dynamically accreting material of CO/He WD mergers which may provide a suitable
environment for significant production of 18O and the very low 16O/18O values
observed. We have also discovered that the N abundance depends sensitively on
the peak temperature in the He--burning shell. Our MESA modeling consists of
engineering the star by adding He--WD material to an initial CO--WD model, and
then following the post--merger evolution using a nuclear--reaction network to
match the observed RCB abundances as it expands and cools to become an RCB
star. These new models are more physical because they include rotation, mixing,
mass-loss, and nucleosynthesis within MESA. We follow the later evolution
beyond the RCB phase to determine the stars' likely lifetimes. The relative
numbers of known RCB and Extreme Helium (EHe) stars correspond well to the
lifetimes predicted from the MESA models. In addition, most of computed
abundances agree very well with the observed range of abundances for the RCB
class.

stellar disc evolve to form phase space spirals similar to those discovered by
Antoja et al. ( arXiv:1804.10196) in Gaia Data Release 2. These spirals were
found by projecting Solar Neighbourhood stars onto the $z-v_z$ plane. Faint
spirals appear in the number density of stars projected onto the $z-v_z$ plane,
which can be explained by a simple model for phase wrapping. More prominent
spirals are seen when bins across the $z-v_z$ plane are coloured by median
$v_R$ or $v_\phi$. We use both toy model and fully self-consistent simulations
to show that the spirals develop naturally from vertical bending oscillations
of a stellar disc. The underlying physics follows from the observation that the
vertical energy of a star (essentially, its ""radius"" in the $z-v_z$ plane)
correlates with its angular momentum or, alternatively, guiding radius.
Moreover, at fixed physical radius, the guiding radius determines the azimuthal
velocity. Together, these properties imply the link between in-plane and
vertical motion that lead directly to the Gaia spirals. We show that the cubic
$R-z$ coupling term in the effective potential is crucial for understanding the
morphology of the spirals. This suggests that phase space spirals might be a
powerful probe of the Galactic potential. In addition, we argue that
self-gravity is necessary to properly model the evolution of the bending waves
and their attendant phase space spirals.

recoverable, elastic strain increment is unaffected by alterations of the
elastic moduli that accompany loading. This assumption is found to be false for
a granular material, and discrete element (DEM) simulations demonstrate that
granular materials are coupled materials at both micro- and macro-scales.
Elasto-plastic coupling at the macro-scale is placed in the context of
thermomechanics framework of Tomasz Hueckel and Hans Ziegler, in which the
elastic moduli are altered by irreversible processes during loading. This
complex behavior is explored for multi-directional loading probes that follow
an initial monotonic loading. An advanced DEM model is used in the study, with
non-convex non-spherical particles and two different contact models: a
conventional linear-frictional model and an exact implementation of the
Hertz-like Cattaneo-Mindlin model. Rectilinear true-triaxial probes were used
in the study (i.e., no direct shear strain), with tiny strain increments of
$2\times 10^{-6}$. At the micro-scale, contact movements were monitored during
small increments of loading and load-reversal, and results show that these
movements are not reversed by a reversal of strain direction, and some contacts
that were sliding during a loading increment continue to slide during reversal.
The probes show that the coupled part of a strain increment, the difference
between the recoverable (elastic) increment and its reversible part, must be
considered when partitioning strain increments into elastic and plastic parts.
Small increments of irreversible (and plastic) strain and contact slipping and
frictional dissipation occur for all directions of loading, and an elastic
domain, if it exists at all, is smaller than the strain increment used in the
simulations.

furthest X-ray cavities consist of aged plasma. All observed signatures both in

distortions in the tail's inner parts, which we attribute to the activity of

Bayesian inference techniques to recover the alpha values for clusters
simulated with slug, using mock observations of these clusters comprised of
broad-band photometry and equivalent width measurements of a selection of UV
spectral features. We find some improvement when compared to attempts using
broad-band photometry alone (with the interquartile range of the alpha
posterior PDF shrinking by 32%), although we still do not yet fully break the
known degeneracy between the cluster mass and alpha. Finally, we make
predictions about how effective real observations will be by quantifying our
ability to constrain alpha as a function of limiting equivalent width. We find
that observations sensitive to a modest equivalent width of 9 A are sufficient
to improve the recovery of the IMF slope parameter by 32% (interquartile range

nearest and brightest SNe Ia yet observed by the Kepler spacecraft. Here we
present the discovery of ASASSN-18bt, the K2 light curve, and pre-discovery
data from ASAS-SN and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System
(ATLAS). The K2 early-time light curve has an unprecedented 30-minute cadence
and photometric precision for an SN~Ia light curve, and it unambiguously shows
a ~4 day nearly linear phase followed by a steeper rise. Thus, ASASSN-18bt
joins a growing list of SNe Ia whose early light curves are not well described
by a single power law. We show that a double-power-law model fits the data
reasonably well, hinting that two physical processes must be responsible for
the observed rise. However, we find that current models of the interaction with
a non-degenerate companion predict an abrupt rise and cannot adequately explain
the initial, slower linear phase. Instead, we find that existing, published
models with shallow 56Ni are able to span the observed behavior and, with
tuning, may be able to reproduce the ASASSN-18bt light curve. Regardless, more
theoretical work is needed to satisfactorily model this and other early-time
SNe~Ia light curves. Finally, we use Swift X-ray non-detections to constrain
the presence of circumstellar material (CSM) at much larger distances and lower
densities than possible with the optical light curve. For a constant density
CSM these non-detections constrain rho<4.5 * 10^5 cm^-3 at a radius of 4 *10^15

The reversible response was linear but exhibited a high degree of stiffness
anisotropy. The irreversible behavior, however, departed in several respects
from classical elasto-plasticity. A small amount of irreversible strain and
contact slipping occurred for all directions of the stress increment (loading,
unloading, transverse loading, etc.), demonstrating that an elastic domain, if
it exists at all, is smaller than the strain increment used in the simulations.
Irreversible strain occurred in directions tangent to the primary yield
surface, and the direction of the irreversible strain varied with the direction
of the stress increment. For stress increments within the deviatoric pi-plane,
the irreversible response had rounded-corners, evidence of multiple plastic
mechanisms. The response at these rounded corners varied in a continuous manner
as a function of stress direction. The results are placed in the context of
advanced elasto-plasticity models: multi-mechanism plasticity and tangential
plasticity. Although these models are an improvement on conventional
elasto-plasticity, they do not fully fit the simulation results.

stellar masses that mimic a single cosmological survey covering the redshift
range between z~0 to z~7. We confirm that the Star-Forming Main Sequence holds
as a tight relation in this range of redshifts, and evolves strongly in both
the zero-point and slope. This evolution is different for the population of
local star-forming (SFGs) and retired (RGs) galaxies, with the latter
presenting a stronger evolution in the zero-point and a weaker evolution in the
slope. The fraction of RGs decreases rapidly with z, particularly for those
classified as RGs at z~0. Contrary to previous studies we detect RGs well above
z>1, although not all of them are progenitors of local RGs. Finally, adopting
the required corrections to make the survey complete in mass in a limited
volume, we recover the cosmic star-formation rate (SFR), stellar mass density,
and average specific SFR histories of the Universe in this wide range of
look-back times, with a remarkable agreement with the values reported by
various cosmological surveys. We demonstrate that the progenitors of local RGs
were more actively forming stars in the past, contributing to most of the
cosmic SFR density at z>0.5, and to most of the cosmic stellar mass density at
any redshift. They suffer a general quenching in the SFR at z~0.35. Below this
redshift the progenitors of local SFGs dominate the SFR density of the
Universe.

the outer belts and spiralling inwards under Poynting-Robertson drag. We
present an empirical model fitted to N-body simulations that allows the fate of
these dust particles when they encounter a planet to be rapidly calculated.
High mass planets eject most particles, whilst dust passes low mass planets
relatively unperturbed. Close-in, high mass planets (hot Jupiters) are best at
accreting dust. The model predicts the accretion rate of dust onto planets
interior to debris belts, with mass accretions rates of up to hundreds of
kilograms per second predicted for hot Jupiters interior to outer debris belts,
when collisional evolution is also taken into account. The model can be used to
infer the presence and likely masses of as yet undetected planets in systems
with outer belts. The non-detection of warm dust with the Large Binocular
Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) around Vega could be explained by the presence
of a single Saturn mass planet, or a chain of lower mass planets. Similarly,
the detection of warm dust in such systems implies the absence of planets above
a quantifiable level, which can be lower than similar limits from direct
imaging. The level of dust detected with LBTI around beta Leo can be used to
rule out the presence of planets more massive than a few Saturn masses outside

occurs and damage statistics, are some of the key quantities of interest (QoI).
High-fidelity models for brittle failure that accurately predict these QoI
exist but are highly computationally intensive, making them infeasible to
incorporate in upscaling and uncertainty quantification frameworks. The goal of
this paper is to provide a fast heuristic to reasonably estimate quantities
such as failure path and damage in the process of brittle failure. Towards this
goal, we first present a method to predict failure paths under tensile loading
conditions and low-strain rates. The method uses a $k$-nearest neighbors
algorithm built on fracture process zone theory, and identifies the set of all
possible pre-existing cracks that are likely to join early to form a large
crack. The method then identifies zone of failure and failure paths using
weighted graphs algorithms. We compare these failure paths to those computed
with a high-fidelity model called the Hybrid Optimization Software Simulation
Suite (HOSS). A probabilistic evolution model for average damage in a system is
also developed that is trained using 150 HOSS simulations and tested on 40
simulations. A non-parametric approach based on confidence intervals is used to
determine the damage evolution over time along the dominant failure path. For
upscaling, damage is the key QoI needed as an input by the continuum models.
This needs to be informed accurately by the surrogate models for calculating
effective modulii at continuum-scale. We show that for the proposed average
damage evolution model, the prediction accuracy on the test data is more than
90\%. In terms of the computational time, the proposed models are $\approx
\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ times faster compared to high-fidelity HOSS.

$\operatorname{CIP}_{\infty}$. These problems generalize the well-studied Set
Cover problem. We make two algorithmic contributions.
  First, we show that a simple algorithm based on randomized rounding with
alteration improves or matches the best known approximation algorithms for
$\operatorname{CIP}$ and $\operatorname{CIP}_{\infty}$ in a wide range of
parameter settings, and these bounds are essentially optimal. As a byproduct of
the simplicity of the alteration algorithm and analysis, we can derandomize the
algorithm without any loss in the approximation guarantee or efficiency.
Previous work by Chen, Harris and Srinivasan [12] which obtained near-tight
bounds is based on a resampling-based randomized algorithm whose analysis is
complex.
  Non-trivial approximation algorithms for $\operatorname{CIP}$ are based on
solving the natural LP relaxation strengthened with knapsack cover (KC)
inequalities [5,24,12]. Our second contribution is a fast (essentially
near-linear time) approximation scheme for solving the strengthened LP with a
factor of $n$ speed up over the previous best running time [5].
  Together, our contributions lead to near-optimal (deterministic)

interest. In between the outgoing pulses, the radar measures the signal
reflected from the targets to determine their presence, range, velocity and
other characteristics. Radar systems face multiple challenges, generating many
trade-offs such as bandwidth versus range resolution and dwell time versus
Doppler resolution. In MIMO radar, high resolution requires a large aperture
and high number of antennas, increasing hardware and processing requirements.
  Recently, novel approaches in sampling theory and radar signal processing
have been proposed to allow target detection and parameter recovery from
samples obtained below the Nyquist rate. These techniques exploit the sparsity
of the target scene in order to reduce the required number of samples, pulses
and antennas, breaking the link between bandwidth, dwell time and number of
antennas on the one hand and range, Doppler and azimuth resolution,
respectively, on the other.
  This review introduces this so-called sub-Nyquist radar paradigm and
describes the corresponding sampling and recovery algorithms, that leverage
compressed sensing techniques to perform time and spatial compression. We focus
on non radar imaging applications and survey many recent compressed radar
systems. Our goal is to review the main impacts of compressed radar on
parameter resolution as well as digital and analog complexity. The survey
includes fast and slow time compression schemes as well as spatial compression
approaches. We show that beyond substantial rate reduction, compression may
also enable communication and radar spectrum sharing. Throughout the paper, we
consider both theoretical and practical aspects of compressed radar, and
present hardware prototype implementations, demonstrating real-time target
parameter recovery from low rate samples in pulse-Doppler and MIMO radars.

the probed radial range. We do not find many galaxies with kinematic
transitions such as those expected between the inner in-situ and outer accreted
stars within the radial range probed. We compare the V/sigma gradient and
maximum values to the visual morphologies of the galaxies to better understand
the link between visual and kinematic morphologies. We find that the radial
distribution of dynamical support in galaxies is linked to their visual
morphology. Late-type systems have higher rotational support at all radii and
steeper V/sigma gradients compared to early-type galaxies. We perform a search
for embedded discs, which are rotationally supported discy structures embedded
within large scale slowly or non-rotating structures. Visual inspection of the
kinematics reveals at most three galaxies (out of 384) harbouring embedded

electrocardiographic signals with deep recurrent denoising neural networks. We
utilize a transfer learning technique by pretraining the network using
synthetic data, generated by a dynamic ECG model, and fine-tuning it with a
real data. We also investigate the impact of the synthetic training data on the
network performance on real signals. The proposed method was tested on a real
dataset with varying amount of noise. The results indicate that four-layer deep
recurrent neural network can outperform reference methods for heavily noised
signal. Moreover, networks pretrained with synthetic data seem to have better
results than network trained with real data only. We show that it is possible
to create state-of-the art denoising neural network that, pretrained on
artificial data, can perform exceptionally well on real ECG signals after
proper fine-tuning.

mathematical guarantees for such scenarios is challenging but have numerous
potential practical applications. Due to the challenges, analysis of
reach-avoid problems involves making trade-offs between generality of system
dynamics, generality of problem setups, optimality of solutions, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we combine sum-of-squares optimization
and dynamic programming to address the reach-avoid problem, and provide a
conservative solution that maintains reaching and avoidance guarantees. Our
method is applicable to polynomial system dynamics and to general problem
setups, and is more computationally scalable than previous related methods.
Through a numerical example involving two single integrators, we validate our
proposed theory and compare our method to Hamilton-Jacobi reachability. Having

the Gabor transform of white Gaussian noise [Bardenet et al., 2017]. This
answered pioneering work by Flandrin [2015], who observed that the zeros of the
Gabor transform of white noise had a very regular distribution and proposed
filtering algorithms based on the zeros of a spectrogram. The mathematical link
with GAFs provides a wealth of probabilistic results to inform the design of
such signal processing procedures. In this paper, we study in a systematic way
the link between GAFs and a class of time-frequency transforms of Gaussian
white noises on Hilbert spaces of signals. Our main observation is a conceptual
correspondence between pairs (transform, GAF) and generating functions for
classical orthogonal polynomials. This correspondence covers some classical
time-frequency transforms, such as the Gabor transform and the Daubechies-Paul
analytic wavelet transform. It also unveils new windowed discrete Fourier
transforms, which map white noises to fundamental GAFs. All these transforms
may thus be of interest to the research program `filtering with zeros'. We also
identify the GAF whose zeros are the extrema of the Gabor transform of the
white noise and derive their first intensity. Moreover, we discuss important
subtleties in defining a white noise and its transform on infinite dimensional
Hilbert spaces. Finally, we provide quantitative estimates concerning the
finite-dimensional approximations of these white noises, which is of practical
interest when it comes to implementing signal processing algorithms based on
GAFs.

agreement problem, given input values from a lattice, processes have to
non-trivially decide output values that lie on a chain. We consider the lattice

lattice agreement, we present two algorithms which run in $\log f$ and $\min
\{O(\log^2 h(L)), O(\log^2 f)\}$ rounds, respectively, where $h(L)$ denotes the
height of the {\em input sublattice} $L$, $f < n$ is the number of crash

previously known algorithms. The algorithm by Attiya et al.
\cite{attiya1995atomic} takes $\log n$ synchronous rounds, and the algorithm by
Mavronicolasa \cite{mavronicolasabound} takes $\min \{O(h(L)), O(\sqrt{f})\}$

time complexity of $2 \cdot \min \{h(L), f + 1\}$ message delays which improves
on the previously known time complexity of $O(n)$ message delays.

gravitational waves in four dimensional, asymptotically flat spacetime, using
numerical solutions of the Einstein equations. The pure vacuum problem requires
singular, Aichelburg-Sexl type sources to achieve finite energy solutions,
which are problematic to treat both mathematically and numerically. Instead
then, we use null (massless) particles to source non-trivial geometry within
the initial wave fronts. The main purposes of this paper are to (a) motivate
the problem, (b) introduce methods for numerically solving the Einstein
equations coupled to distributions of collisionless massless or massive
particles, and (c) present a first result on the formation of black holes in
the head-on collision of axisymmetric distributions of null particles.
Regarding the last-named, initial conditions are chosen so that a black hole
forms promptly, with essentially no matter escaping the collision. This can be
interpreted as approaching the ultra-relativistic collision problem from within
an infinite boost limit, but where the matter distribution is spread out, and
thus non-singular. We find results that are consistent with earlier
perturbative calculations of the collision of Aichelburg-Sexl singularities, as
well as numerical studies of the high-speed collision of boson stars, black
holes, and fluid stars: a black hole is formed containing most of the energy of
the spacetime, with the remaining $15\pm1\%$ of the initial energy radiated
away as gravitational waves. The methods developed here could be relevant for
other problems in strong field gravity and cosmology that involve particle
distributions of matter.

fusion relations for the transfer matrix, stemming from the Yang-Baxter algebra
properties, provide the necessary closure relations to define the action of the
transfer matrix on such a basis in terms of elementary local shifts, leading to
a separate transfer matrix spectral problem. Hence our scheme extends to the
quantum case a key feature of Liouville-Arnold classical integrability
framework where the complete set of conserved charges defines both the level
manifold and the flows on it leading to the construction of action-angle
variables. We work in the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method.
As a first example of our approach, we give the construction of such a basis
for models associated to Y(gln) and argue how it extends to their trigonometric
and elliptic versions. Then we show how our general scheme applies concretely
to fundamental models associated to the Y(gl2) and Y(gl3) R-matrices leading to
the full characterization of their spectrum. For Y(gl2) and its trigonometric
deformation a particular case of our method reproduces Sklyanin's construction
of separate variables. For Y(gl3) it gives new results, in particular through
the proper identification of the shifts acting on the separate basis. We stress
that our method also leads to the full characterization of the spectrum of
other known quantum integrable lattice models, including in particular
trigonometric and elliptic spin chains, open chains with general integrable
boundaries, and further higher rank cases that we will describe in forthcoming

rapid advances in the available architectures and how networks are trained
based on large computational infrastructure and standard datasets with millions
of images. In contrast, performance and time constraints for example, of small
devices and free cloud GPUs necessitate efficient network training (i.e.,
highest accuracy in the shortest inference time possible), often on small
datasets. Here, we hypothesize that initially decreasing image size during
training makes the training process more efficient, because pre-shaping weights
with small images and later utilizing these weights with larger images reduces
initial network parameters and total inference time. We test this Efficient
Network TRaining (ENTR) Hypothesis by training pre-trained Residual Network
(ResNet) models (ResNet18, 34, & 50) on three small datasets (steel
microstructures, bee images, and geographic aerial images) with a free cloud
GPU. Based on three training regimes of i) not, ii) gradually or iii) in one
step increasing image size over the training process, we show that initially
reducing image size increases training efficiency consistently across datasets
and networks. We interpret these results mechanistically in the framework of
regularization theory. Support for the ENTR hypothesis is an important
contribution, because network efficiency improvements for image recognition
tasks are needed for practical applications. In the future, it will be exciting
to see how the ENTR hypothesis holds for large standard datasets like ImageNet
or CIFAR, to better understand the underlying mechanisms, and how these results

reveal the validity a fundamental ingredient in the foundations of one of the
cornerstones in modern physics namely quantum mechanics. In terms of a certain
parameter $\kappa_S$, it was argued that a non-zero value could imply a
breakdown of the fundamental Born's rule as well as the superposition
principle. Here we argue that a physical realization of such arguments could
lead to an erroneous conclusion and contradict the basic rules of quantum
mechanics. In fact, we argue that a proper interpretation of the procedures
involved in a physical determination of $\kappa_S$ does not necessarily lead to
$\kappa_S=0$. In order to show this we consider a mono-chromatic source of
photons prepared in an {\it arbitrary} quantum state and a simple version of
the well-established photon detection theory of Glauber which, by construction,
obeys all the rules of quantum mechanics. It is, however, also argued that
after a proper identification of the relevant quantum-mechanical probability
amplitudes one can be reach $\kappa_S=0$. As long as one only consider a single
photon detector, it is verified that, in this context, there is no fundamental
difference between quantum-mechanical interference and interference as
expressed in terms of classical electro-magnetic waves.

strength, we find a series of distinct dynamical phases, including an
interstitial flow phase, a moving disordered state, a moving crystal, and a

signatures in the skyrmion lattice structure, the skyrmion Hall angle, the
velocity fluctuation distributions, and the velocity-force curves. The moving
clustered state is similar to the segregated state recently observed in
continuum-based simulations with strong quenched disorder. The segregation
arises from the drive dependence of the skyrmion Hall angle, and appears in the
strong pinning limit when the skyrmions have nonuniform velocities, causing
different portions of the sample to have different effective skyrmion Hall

Zeeman splitting was used to probe the topological nature. Here instead we
treat a ferromagnetic material, half-metallic GdN, where the splitting of the
triple nodal points comes from the spin-orbit coupling. The size of the
splitting ranges from 15 to 150 meV depending on the magnetization orientation,
enabling a transition between a Weyl-point phase and a ""nearly triple nodal

planet-star mass ratios, but such models are highly nonlinear and difficult to
invert. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are often used to explore the
posterior distribution for model parameters, but, due to the high correlations
between parameters, nonlinearity, and potential multi-modality in the
posterior, many samplers perform very inefficiently. Therefore, we assess the
performance of several MCMC samplers that use varying degrees of geometric
information about the target distribution. We generate synthetic datasets from
multiple models, including the TTVFaster model and a simple sinusoidal model,
and test the efficiencies of various MCMC samplers. We find that sampling
efficiency can be greatly improved for all models by sampling from a parameter
space transformed using an estimate of the covariance and means of the target
distribution. No one sampler performs the best for all datasets, but several
samplers, such as Differential Evolution Monte Carlo and Geometric adaptive
Monte Carlo, have consistently efficient performance. For datasets with near
Gaussian posteriors, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers with 2 or 3 leapfrog
steps obtained the highest efficiencies. Based on differences in effective
sample sizes per time, we show that the right choice of sampler can improve
sampling efficiencies by several orders of magnitude.

due to boundary terms, even for closed systems and with real potentials. The
role played by these non-Hermiticities on quantum mechanical uncertainty
relations is discussed, especially in multiply-connected spaces. These
subtleties, reflections of topological quantum anomalies (for any
dimensionality, for both Schrodinger and Dirac/Weyl Hamiltonians and for either
continuous or lattice (tight-binding) models) can always be written as global
fluxes of certain generalized current densities Jg. In continuous
nonrelativistic models, these have the forms that had earlier been used by
Chemists, while for Dirac/Weyl or other lattice models they have relativistic
forms only recently worked out. Examples are provided where such
non-Hermiticities have a direct physical significance (for both conventional
and topological materials). In all examples considered, these non-Hermitian
boundary terms turn out to be quantized, the quantization being either of
conventional or of a topological (Quantum Hall Effect (QHE))-type. The latter
claim is substantiated through application to a simple QHE arrangement (2D
Landau system in an external in-plane electric field), where some particular Jg
is related to the well-known edge currents. The non-Hermitian terms play a
subtle role on Berry curvatures in solids and seem to be crucial for the
consistent application of the Modern Theories of Polarization and Orbital
Magnetization. It is emphasized that the above systems can be closed (in
multiply-connected space, so that the boundaries disappear, but the
non-Hermiticity remains), a case in non-Hermitian physics that has not been

test of this kind for models of negative hydrogen ion sources (NHIS), and very
good agreement has been achieved for electron temperature, vibrational
distribution function (VDF) of hydrogen molecules, and n_H^-/n_e ratio. The
small discrepancies in number densities of negative hydrogen ions, positive
ions, as well as hydrogen atoms can be attributed to the differences in the
predicted electron number density for given discharge power. Higher electron
number density obtained with GMNHIS is possibly due to fewer dissociation
channels accounted for in GMNHIS, leading to smaller energy loss. In addition,
we validated GMNHIS against experimental data obtained in an electron cyclotron
resonance (ECR) discharge used for H^- production. The model qualitatively (and
even quantitatively for certain conditions) reproduces the experimental H^-
number density. The H^- number density as a function of pressure first
increases at pressures below 12 mTorr, and then saturates for higher pressures.
This dependence was analyzed by evaluating contributions from different
reaction pathways to the creation and loss of the H^- ions. The developed codes
can be used for predicting the H^- production, improving the performance of
NHIS, and ultimately optimizing the parameters of negative ion beams for ITER.

components. In contrast to the notably different photoassociation-induced
fractional atom losses observed for the bare spin components of a statistical
mixture, a superposition state with a comparable spin composition displays the
same fractional loss on every spin component. We interpret this as the
superposition state itself undergoing photoassociation. For superposition
states induced by a large Raman coupling and zero Raman detuning, we observe a
nearly complete suppression of the photoassociation rate. This suppression is
consistent with a model based upon quantum destructive interference between two
photoassociation pathways for colliding atoms with different spin combinations.
This model also explains the measured dependence of the photoassociation rate
on the Raman detuning at a moderate Raman coupling. Our work thus suggests that
preparing atoms in quantum superpositions may represent a powerful new
technique to coherently control photochemical reactions.

We first analyse the secrecy capacity of the direct source-to-destination

then introduced to improve reliability and security of communications in the

erasures to multiple receivers with different messages (multiple uni-cast) each
with possibly different hard deadline constraints. A novel metric is proposed
and evaluated: the global deadline outage probability, which gives the
probability that the hard communication deadline is not met for at least one of
the receivers. The cut-set upper bound is derived and a scheduling policy is
proposed to determine which receiver's packets should be sent in each time
slot. This policy is shown to be optimal among all scheduling policies, i.e.,
it achieves all boundary points of cut-set upper bounds when the transmitter
knows the erasure patterns for all the receivers ahead of making the scheduling
decision. An expression for the global deadline outage probability is obtained
for two receivers and is plotted and interpreted for various system parameters.
These plots are not Monte-Carlo simulations, and hence the obtained expression
may be used in the design of future downlink broadcast networks. Future
extensions to per-user deadline outage probabilities as well as to scenarios
with causal knowledge of the channel states are briefly discussed.

observations at multiple sensors is considered. Such a framework is relevant to
many cyber-physical systems and internet-of-things applications. Sensors make
sequential measurements that are shared with a fusion center; the fusion center
applies a certain filtering algorithm to make its estimates. The challenge is
the presence of a few unknown malicious sensors which can inject anomalous
observations to skew the estimates at the fusion center. The set of malicious
sensors may be time-varying. The problems of malicious sensor detection and
secure estimation are considered. First, an algorithm for secure estimation is
proposed. The proposed estimation scheme uses a novel filtering and learning
algorithm, where an optimal filter is learnt over time by using the sensor
observations in order to filter out malicious sensor observations while
retaining other sensor measurements. Next, a novel detector to detect injection
attacks on an unknown sensor subset is developed. Numerical results demonstrate
up to 3 dB gain in the mean squared error and up to 75% higher attack detection
probability under a small false alarm rate constraint, against a competing
algorithm that requires additional side information.

challenging because mobile models need to be small and fast, yet still
accurate. Although significant efforts have been dedicated to design and
improve mobile CNNs on all dimensions, it is very difficult to manually balance
these trade-offs when there are so many architectural possibilities to
consider. In this paper, we propose an automated mobile neural architecture
search (MNAS) approach, which explicitly incorporate model latency into the
main objective so that the search can identify a model that achieves a good
trade-off between accuracy and latency. Unlike previous work, where latency is
considered via another, often inaccurate proxy (e.g., FLOPS), our approach
directly measures real-world inference latency by executing the model on mobile
phones. To further strike the right balance between flexibility and search
space size, we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space that
encourages layer diversity throughout the network. Experimental results show
that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mobile CNN models
across multiple vision tasks. On the ImageNet classification task, our MnasNet
achieves 75.2% top-1 accuracy with 78ms latency on a Pixel phone, which is 1.8x
faster than MobileNetV2 [29] with 0.5% higher accuracy and 2.3x faster than

([Fe/H]=-4.0) and very large enhancement of C, N, and O with excesses of Na,
Mg, Al, and Si. This star is a new example of a small group of such CEMP stars
identified by previous studies. We find a very similar abundance pattern for
O-Zn in this class of objects that shows enhancement of elements up to Si and
normal abundance of Ca and Fe-group elements. Whereas the C/N ratio is
different among these stars, the (C+N)/O ratio is similar. This suggests that C
was also yielded with similar abundance ratios relative to O-Zn in progenitors,
and was later affected by the CN-cycle. By contrast, the heavy neutron-capture
elements Sr and Ba are deficient in J2217+2104, compared to the four objects in
this class previously studied. This indicates that the neutron-capture process
in the early Galaxy, presumably the r-process, has no direct connection to the
phenomenon that has formed such CEMP stars. Comparisons of the abundance
pattern well determined for such CEMP stars with those of supernova
nucleosynthesis models constrain the progenitor mass to be about 25Msun, which
is not particularly different from typical mass of progenitors expected for
extremely metal-poor stars in general.

  We use spectral spanners to study composable core-sets for spectral problems.
We show that for many objective functions one can use a spectral spanner,

system to behave as intended without being affected by malicious external
influences that can compromise its integrity and efficiency. Security attacks
can be divided based on when they occur: if an attack occurs during training,
it is known as a poisoning attack, and if it occurs during inference (after
training) it is termed an evasion attack. Poisoning attacks compromise the
training process by corrupting the data with malicious examples, while evasion
attacks use adversarial examples to disrupt entire classification process.
Defenses proposed against such attacks include techniques to recognize and
remove malicious data, train a model to be insensitive to such data, and mask
the model's structure and parameters to render attacks more challenging to
implement. Furthermore, the privacy of the data involved in model training is
also threatened by attacks such as the model-inversion attack, or by dishonest
service providers of AI applications. To maintain data privacy, several
solutions that combine existing data-privacy techniques have been proposed,
including differential privacy and modern cryptography techniques. In this

framework that (1) assimilates UAV observations with speed-density sensor data,
(2) quantifies uncertainty on the road/traffic state, and (3) adaptively
navigates the UAV to minimize this uncertainty. The navigation algorithm uses
the A-optimal information measure (mean uncertainty), and it depends on
covariance matrices generated by a dual state ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). In
the EnKF procedure, since observations are a nonlinear function of the incident
state variables, we use diagnostic variables that represent model predicted
measurements. We also present a state update procedure that maintains a
monotonic relationship between incident parameters and measurements. We compare
the traffic/incident state estimates resulting from the UAV
navigation-estimation procedure against corresponding estimates that do not use

extracts caging loops through a topological analysis of the distance field

appear two distinct modes with linear and quadratic dispersion relations at low

found to be related to each other by simple rescaling when vortices in
different components overlap owing to an intercomponent attraction. These
results are consistent with an effective field theory analysis. However, the
rescaling relations break down for interlaced vortex lattices appearing with an
intercomponent repulsion, indicating a nontrivial effect of an intercomponent
vortex displacement beyond the effective field theory. We also find that
high-energy parts of the excitation bands exhibit line or point nodes as a
consequence of a fractional translation symmetry present in some of the lattice

fainter than that of core-collapse supernovae, and is consistent with those of
supernova impostors and other Intermediate-Luminosity Optical Transients. The
quasi-bolometric lightcurve peaks at $\sim$ 2 $\times$ 10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
and the late-time photometry allows us to constrain an ejected $^{56}$Ni mass
of $\sim$ 8 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$\msun. The spectra of AT~2017be show minor
evolution over the observational period, a relatively blue continuum showing at
early phases, which becomes redder with time. A prominent H$\alpha$ emission
line always dominates over other Balmer lines. Weak Fe {\sc ii} features,
Ca~{\sc ii} H$\&$K and the Ca {\sc ii} NIR triplet are also visible, while
P-Cygni absorption troughs are found in a high resolution spectrum. In
addition, the [Ca~{\sc ii}] $\lambda$7291,7324 doublet is visible in all
spectra. This feature is typical of Intermediate-Luminosity Red Transients
(ILRTs), similar to SN~2008S. The relatively shallow archival Spitzer data are
not particularly constraining. On the other hand, a non-detection in deeper
near-infrared HST images disfavours a massive Luminous Blue Variable eruption
as the origin for AT~2017be. As has been suggested for other ILRTs, we propose
that AT~2017be is a candidate for a weak electron-capture supernova explosion
of a super-asymptotic giant branch star, still embedded in a thick dusty

alternative to vocoders and hence they are often called neural vocoders. The
neural vocoder uses acoustic features as local condition parameters, and these
parameters need to be accurately predicted by another acoustic model. However,
it is not yet clear how to train this acoustic model, which is problematic
because the final quality of synthetic speech is significantly affected by the
performance of the acoustic model. Significant degradation happens, especially
when predicted acoustic features have mismatched characteristics compared to
natural ones. In order to reduce the mismatched characteristics between natural
and generated acoustic features, we propose frameworks that incorporate either
a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) or its variant, Wasserstein
GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP), into multi-speaker speech synthesis that
uses the WaveNet vocoder. We also extend the GAN frameworks and use the
discretized mixture logistic loss of a well-trained WaveNet in addition to mean
squared error and adversarial losses as parts of objective functions.
Experimental results show that acoustic models trained using the WGAN-GP
framework using back-propagated discretized-mixture-of-logistics (DML) loss
achieves the highest subjective evaluation scores in terms of both quality and

generates suitable features for wind power prediction using atmospheric

and generalization capabilities, is able to learn the fluctuations in the
meteorological properties and thus is able to perform effective mapping of the
wind power. In the deep network, a regression layer is appended at the end to
predict sort-term wind power. It is experimentally shown that the deep learning

  Communication",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Peripheral authentication is an important aspect in the vehicle networks to
provide services to only authenticated peripherals and a security to internal
vehicle modules such as anti-lock braking system, power-train control module,
engine control unit, transmission control unit, and tire pressure monitoring.
In this paper a three-way handshake scheme is proposed for a vehicle to a
keyfob authentication. A keyfob is a key with a secure hardware that
communicates and authenticates the vehicle over the wireless channel.
Conventionally, a vehicle to keyfob authentication is realized through a
challenge-response verification protocol. An authentic coupling between the
vehicle identity and the keyfob avoids any illegal access to the vehicle.
However, these authentication messages can be relayed by an active adversary,
thereby, can amplify the actual distance between an authentic vehicle and a
keyfob. Eventually, an adversary can possibly gain access to the vehicle by
relaying wireless signals and without any effort to generate or decode the
secret credentials. Hence, the vehicle to keyfob authentication scheme must
contain an additional attribute verification such as physical movement of a
keyfob holder.
  Our solution is a two-party and three-way handshake scheme with proactive and
reactive commitment verification. The proposed solution also uses a time
interval verification such that both vehicle and keyfob would yield a similar
locomotion pattern of a dynamic keyfob within a similar observational time
interval. Hence, the solution is different from the distance bounding protocols
that require multiple iterations for the round-trip delay measurement. The
proposed scheme is shown to be adaptable with the existing commitment scheme
such as Schnorr identification scheme and Pedersen commitment scheme.

look at the challenging problem of cross modal face verification and
recognition between caricature and visual image modalities. Caricature have
exaggerations of facial features of a person. Due to the significant variations
in the caricatures, building vision models for recognizing and verifying data
from this modality is an extremely challenging task. Visual images with
significantly lesser amount of distortions can act as a bridge for the analysis
of caricature modality. We introduce a publicly available large
Caricature-VIsual dataset [CaVI] with images from both the modalities that
captures the rich variations in the caricature of an identity. This paper
presents the first cross modal architecture that handles extreme distortions of
caricatures using a deep learning network that learns similar representations
across the modalities. We use two convolutional networks along with
transformations that are subjected to orthogonality constraints to capture the
shared and modality specific representations. In contrast to prior research,
our approach neither depends on manually extracted facial landmarks for
learning the representations, nor on the identities of the person for
performing verification. The learned shared representation achieves 91%
accuracy for verifying unseen images and 75% accuracy on unseen identities.
Further, recognizing the identity in the image by knowledge transfer using a
combination of shared and modality specific representations, resulted in an
unprecedented performance of 85% rank-1 accuracy for caricatures and 95% rank-1
accuracy for visual images.

we investigated the change of the transmission probability of a bellow compared
to a cylindrical tube in TPMC simulations. The results were used to develop an
empirical model to simplify the geometry of a bellow in a TPMC model by
replacing it with a cylindrical tube of extended length, consequently
compensating the reduced conductance of the bellow. The simulated transmission
probabilities of a variety of different bellow lengths have been used to fit
the parameters of the model. Each bellow geometry simulated with MolFlow+
comprised two cylindrical tubes, one at each end, and the central bellow
section. The geometry of each bellow is described by two quantities. The first
one is the total length of the geometry model normalized to the inner diameter
of the bellow. The second one is the fraction of the bellow section with regard
to the total length. Simulating a tube instead of a long bellow reduced the
simulation time by a factor of up to 1000, while the error introduced through
the replacement of the bellow with a cylindrical tube of modified length was in
most cases negligible.

demonstrate that the proposed initialization scheme learns at a speed of orders
of magnitudes faster than the classical ones, and thus attests a strong

multimedia applications. Most existing works tend to introduce complex priors
to estimate the sharp image structures for blur kernel estimation. However, it
has been verified that directly optimizing these models is challenging and easy
to fall into degenerate solutions. Although several experience-based heuristic
inference strategies, including trained networks and designed iterations, have
been developed, it is still hard to obtain theoretically guaranteed accurate
solutions. In this work, a collaborative learning framework is established to
address the above issues. Specifically, we first design two modules, named
Generator and Corrector, to extract the intrinsic image structures from the
data-driven and knowledge-based perspectives, respectively. By introducing a
collaborative methodology to cascade these modules, we can strictly prove the
convergence of our image propagations to a deblurring-related optimal solution.
As a nontrivial byproduct, we also apply the proposed method to address other

unresolved, compact emission knot was discovered to be located 0.166"" away from

captured from the WD progenitor when it was an asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
star. In this paper, we assess the hot WD to determine its atmospheric and
stellar parameters. We performed a model-atmosphere analysis of ultraviolet

0.4, and a solar helium abundance (He = 0.25 +/- 0.1, mass fraction). We
measured the abundances of ten more species (C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Ar, Fe, Ni)

wind mass-loss, with a theoretical rate of log(dot-M/M_sun/yr) = -11.0

photosphere. The WD has a mass of M/M_sun = 0.58 (+0.12)(-0.04) and its
post-AGB age (log(t_evol/yr) = 3.60 (+1.26)(-0.09)) is compatible with the PN

annotations, especially in biomedical segmentation. Although many
semi-supervised methods have been proposed to provide extra training data,
automatically generated labels are usually too noisy to retrain models
effectively. In this paper, we propose a Two-Stream Mutual Attention Network
(TSMAN) that weakens the influence of back-propagated gradients caused by
incorrect labels, thereby rendering the network robust to unclean data. The
proposed TSMAN consists of two sub-networks that are connected by three types
of attention models in different layers. The target of each attention model is
to indicate potentially incorrect gradients in a certain layer for both
sub-networks by analyzing their inferred features using the same input. In
order to achieve this purpose, the attention models are designed based on the
propagation analysis of noisy gradients at different layers. This allows the
attention models to effectively discover incorrect labels and weaken their
influence during the parameter updating process. By exchanging multi-level
features within the two-stream architecture, the effects of noisy labels in
each sub-network are reduced by decreasing the updating gradients. Furthermore,
a hierarchical distillation is developed to provide more reliable pseudo labels
for unlabelded data, which further boosts the performance of our retrained
TSMAN. The experiments using both the HVSMR 2016 and BRATS 2015 benchmarks
demonstrate that our semi-supervised learning framework surpasses the

Multi-speaker DOA estimation is formulated as a multi-class multi-label

feature is treated as a separate binary classification problem. The phase
component of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) coefficients of the

DOA estimation approach to adapt to unseen acoustic conditions and its
robustness to unseen noise type is demonstrated. Through additional empirical
investigation, it is also shown that with an array of M microphones our
proposed framework yields the best localization performance with M-1

  Mittal","A Zero-Shot Framework for Sketch-based Image Retrieval","Accepted in ECCV 2018, Munich Germany",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) is the task of retrieving images from a
natural image database that correspond to a given hand-drawn sketch. Ideally,
an SBIR model should learn to associate components in the sketch (say, feet,
tail, etc.) with the corresponding components in the image having similar shape
characteristics. However, current evaluation methods simply focus only on
coarse-grained evaluation where the focus is on retrieving images which belong
to the same class as the sketch but not necessarily having the same shape
characteristics as in the sketch. As a result, existing methods simply learn to
associate sketches with classes seen during training and hence fail to
generalize to unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark for
zero-shot SBIR where the model is evaluated in novel classes that are not seen
during training. We show through extensive experiments that existing models for
SBIR that are trained in a discriminative setting learn only class specific
mappings and fail to generalize to the proposed zero-shot setting. To
circumvent this, we propose a generative approach for the SBIR task by
proposing deep conditional generative models that take the sketch as an input
and fill the missing information stochastically. Experiments on this new
benchmark created from the ""Sketchy"" dataset, which is a large-scale database
of sketch-photo pairs demonstrate that the performance of these generative
models is significantly better than several state-of-the-art approaches in the
proposed zero-shot framework of the coarse-grained SBIR task.

method to be called unsmoothed particle hydrodynamics SPH$-i$ which makes few
assumptions and makes no assumption beyond the Navier-Stokes equations. The
most attractive feature when compared with standard smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) is that no explicit turbulence modeling is required.
Furthermore, despite being a high order model, it retains the same, simple
structure as standard SPH. In this sense SPH$-i$ is a coarse-grained direct
numerical simulation approach.
  In SPH, due the scale-dependence resulting from the convolution operator, all
modes below the kernel cut-off length, are filtered out leading to loss of
information. However, we conjecture that the SPH field, theoretically, still
contains enough information so that the SPH$-i$ field is a restored form of the
original underlying continuum field. Since two filters are required, a rigorous
technique for constructing compatible convolution and deconvolution filters is
presented. The SPH$-i$ model is relatively easy to implement.

translational invariance are broken spontaneously at the same time. We include
an ionic lattice that breaks translational symmetry explicitly in the UV of the
theory. Thus, this construction realizes spontaneous crystallization on top of
a background lattice. We solve the Dirac equation for a probe fermion in the
associated background geometry using numerical techniques, and explore the
interplay between spontaneous and explicit breaking of translations. We note
that in our model the breaking of the U(1) symmetry doesn't play a role in the
analysis of the fermionic spectral function. We investigate under which
conditions a Fermi surface can form and focus in particular on how the ionic
lattice affects its structure. When the ionic lattice becomes sufficiently
strong the spectral weight peaks broaden, denoting a gradual disappearance of
the Fermi surface along the symmetry breaking direction. This phenomenon occurs
even in the absence of spontaneously generated stripes. The resulting Fermi
surface appears to consist of detached segments reminiscent of Fermi arcs.

unexplored, such probes are set to rise dramatically in importance as upcoming
surveys provide data of unprecedented quantity and quality on galaxy structure
and dynamics. In this paper, we use warping of stellar disks to test the
chameleon- or symmetron-screened fifth forces which generically arise when new
fields couple to matter. We take r-band images of mostly late-type galaxies
from the Nasa Sloan Atlas and develop an automated algorithm to quantify the
degree of U-shaped warping they exhibit. We then forward-model the warp signal
as a function of fifth-force strength $\Delta G/G_N$ and range $\lambda_C$, and
the gravitational environments and internal properties of the galaxies,
including full propagation of the non-Gaussian uncertainties. Convolving this
fifth-force likelihood function with a Gaussian describing astrophysical and
observational noise and then constraining $\Delta G/G_N$ and $\lambda_C$ by
Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we find the overall likelihood to be significant
increased ($\Delta\log(\mathcal{L}) \simeq 20$) by adding a screened fifth
force with $\lambda_C \simeq 2$ Mpc, $\Delta G/G_N \simeq 0.01$. The variation
of $\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})$ with $\lambda_C$ is quantitatively as expected
from the correlation of the magnitude of the fifth-force field with the force's
range, and a similar model without screening achieves no increase in likelihood
over the General Relativistic case $\Delta G=0$. Although these results are in
good agreement with a previous analysis of the same model using offsets between
galaxies' stellar and gas mass centroids (Desmond et al. 2018), we caution that
the effects of confounding baryonic and dark matter physics must be thoroughly

subprime crisis and is close to the inversion. This fact has gathered attention
of investors around the world and revived the discussion of proper modeling and
forecasting yield curve, since changes in interest rate structure are believed
to represent investors expectations about the future state of economy and have
foreshadowed recessions in the United States. While changes in term structure
of interest rates are relatively easy to interpret they are however very
difficult to model and forecast due to no proper economic theory underlying
such events. Yield curves are usually represented by multivariate sparse time
series, at any point in time infinite dimensional curve is portrayed via
relatively few points in a multivariate space of data and as a consequence
multimodal statistical dependencies behind these curves are relatively hard to
extract and forecast via typical multivariate statistical methods.We propose to
model yield curves via reconstruction of joint probability distribution of
parameters in functional space as a high degree polynomial. Thanks to adoption
of an orthonormal basis, the MSE estimation of coefficients of a given function
is an average over a data sample in the space of functions. Since such
polynomial coefficients are independent and have cumulant-like interpretation
ie.describe corresponding perturbation from an uniform joint distribution, our
approach can also be extended to any d-dimensional space of yield curve
parameters (also in neighboring times) due to controllable accuracy. We believe
that this approach to modeling of local behavior of a sparse multivariate
curved time series can complement prediction from standard models like ARIMA,
that are using long range dependencies, but provide only inaccurate prediction
of probability distribution, often as just Gaussian with constant width.

suggesting that they are distinct structures. In the region of the Northern Arm
sampled here, there is only a weak correlation between the intensity of the
emission and the degree of polarization. This is consistent with saturated
grain alignment where the degree of polarization depends on geometric effects,
including the angle of inclination of the field to the line of sight and
superposition of filaments with different field directions, rather than the

Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS, an instrument on board
Envisat) during this rare event, show a 40% increase of ozone in the nighttime
secondary ozone layer at subpolar latitudes compared to non-SSW years. This
study investigates the cause of the mesospheric nighttime ozone increase, using
the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Whole Atmosphere Community
Climate Model with specified dynamics (SD-WACCM). The 2002 SH winter was
characterized by several reductions of the strength of the polar night jet in
the upper stratosphere before the jet reversed completely, marking the onset of
the major SSW. At the time of these wind reductions, corresponding episodic
increases can be seen in the modelled nighttime secondary ozone layer. This
ozone increase is attributed largely to enhanced upwelling and the associated
cooling of the altitude region in conjunction with the wind reversal. This is
in correspondence to similar studies of SSW induced ozone enhancements in NH.
But unlike its NH counterpart, the SH secondary ozone layer appeared to be
impacted less by episodic variations in atomic hydrogen. Seasonally decreasing
atomic hydrogen plays however a larger role in SH compared to NH.

spectrum (1-750 keV) from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Polar
Orbiting Environmental Satellites and European Organisation for the
Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites/Meteorological Operational
satellites. To study the importance of ion chemistry for the production of NO,
WACCM-D, which has more complex ion chemistry, is used. Both standard WACCM and
WACCM-D underestimate the storm time NO increase in the main production region
(90-110 km), using both electron energy inputs. At and below 80 km, including
medium-energy electrons ($>$30 keV) is important both for NO directly produced
at this altitude region and for NO transported from other regions (indirect
effect). By using WACCM-D the direct NO production is improved, while the
indirect effects on NO suffer from the downward propagating deficiency above.
In conclusion, both a full range energy spectrum and ion chemistry is needed

epidemic dynamics on networks. We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible

introduced activity-driven networks with memory. By means of an activity-based
mean-field approach we derive, in the long time limit, analytical predictions
for the epidemic threshold as a function of the parameters describing the
distribution of activities and the strength of the memory effects. Our results
show that memory reduces the threshold, which is the same for SIS and SIR
dynamics, therefore favouring epidemic spreading. The theoretical approach
perfectly agrees with numerical simulations in the long time asymptotic regime.
Strong aging effects are present in the preasymptotic regime and the epidemic
threshold is deeply affected by the starting time of the epidemics. We discuss
in detail the origin of the model-dependent preasymptotic corrections, whose
understanding could potentially allow for epidemic control on correlated
temporal networks.

emerging topic in remote sensing. In this paper we propose a framework, based
on image regression, to perform change detection in heterogeneous multitemporal
satellite images, which has become a main topic in remote sensing. Our method
learns a transformation to map the first image to the domain of the other
image, and vice versa. Four regression methods are selected to carry out the
transformation: Gaussian processes, support vector machines, random forests,
and a recently proposed kernel regression method called homogeneous pixel
transformation. To evaluate not only potentials and limitations of our
framework, but also the pros and cons of each regression method, we perform
experiments on two data sets. The results indicates that random forests achieve
good performance, are fast and robust to hyperparameters, whereas the
homogeneous pixel transformation method can achieve better accuracy at the cost
of a higher complexity.

conductance model, we developed in a previous work a theory of fluctuations
based on the notion of homogenization commutator: we proved that the two-scale

fluctuation scaling when averaged on large scales (as opposed to the two-scale
expansion of the solution operator taken separately) and that the large-scale

fluctuations to leading order, which we refer to as the pathwise structure of
fluctuations in stochastic homogenization. In the present contribution we
extend this result in two directions: we treat continuum elliptic (possibly
non-symmetric) systems and allow for strongly correlated coefficient fields
(Gaussian-like with a covariance function that can display an arbitrarily slow
algebraic decay at infinity). Our main result shows in this general setting
that the two-scale expansion of the homogenization commutator is still accurate

large-eddy simulation (WMLES), which is a turbulence modelling approach that
reduces the computational cost of traditional (wall-resolved) LES by
introducing special treatment of the inner region of turbulent boundary layers
(TBLs). The library is based on OpenFOAM and enhances the general-purpose LES
solvers provided by this software with state-of-the-art wall modelling
capability. In particular, the included wall models belong to the class of
wall-stress models that account for the under-resolved turbulent structures by
predicting and enforcing the correct local value of the wall shear stress. A
review of this approach is given, followed by a detailed description of the
library, discussing its functionality and extensible design. The included
wall-stress models are presented, based on both algebraic and ordinary
differential equations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the library, it was
used for WMLES of turbulent channel flow and the flow over a backward-facing
step (BFS). For each flow, a systematic simulation campaign was performed, in
order to find a combination of numerical schemes, grid resolution and wall
model type that would yield a good predictive accuracy for both the mean
velocity field in the outer layer of the TBLs and the mean wall shear stress.
The best result was achieved using a mildly dissipative second-order accurate
scheme for the convective fluxes applied on an isotropic grid with 27000 cells
per $\delta^3$-cube, where $\delta$ is the thickness of the TBL or the
half-height of the channel. An algebraic model based on Spalding's law of the
wall was found to perform well for both flows. On the other hand, the tested
more complicated models, which incorporate the pressure gradient in the wall
shear stress prediction, led to less accurate results.

for nanoscale separation. The enhancement is attributed to the excitation of
anisotropic and hyperbolic plasmonic modes. Meanwhile, a large thermal
modulation effect, depending on the twisted angle of principal axes between the
upper and bottom sheets of anisotropic 2D materials, is revealed. The
near-field radiative heat transfer for different concentrations of electron is
demonstrated and the role of hyperbolic plasmonic modes is analyzed. Our
finding of radiative heat transfer between anisotropic 2D materials may find
promising applications in thermal nano-devices, such as non-contact thermal
modulators, thermal lithography, thermos-photovoltaics, etc.

revenue, we are supposed to maintain an efficient marketplace with plenty of
quality users, guarantee a reasonable return on investment (ROI) for
advertisers, and meanwhile, facilitate a pleasant shopping experience for the
users. These requirements essentially pose a constrained optimization problem.
Directly optimizing over auction parameters yields a discontinuous, non-convex
problem that denies effective solutions. One of our major contribution is a
practical convex optimization formulation of the original problem. We devise a
novel re-parametrization of auction mechanism with discrete sets of
representative instances. To construct the optimization problem, we build an
auction simulation system which estimates the resulted business indicators of
the selected parameters by replaying the auctions recorded from real online
requests. We summarized the experiments on real search traffics to analyze the
effects of fidelity of auction simulation, the efficacy under various
constraint targets and the influence of regularization. The experiment results
show that with proper entropy regularization, we are able to maximize revenue
while constraining other business indicators within given ranges.

calculating the intrinsic Gilbert damping within a unified theoretical
framework, mapping out their connections and the approximations required to
derive each formula. This scheme enables a direct comparison of the different
methods on the same footing and a consistent evaluation of their range of
validity. Most methods lead to very similar results for the bulk ferromagnets
Fe, Co and Ni, due to the low spin-orbit interaction strength and the absence
of the spin pumping mechanism. The effects of inhomogeneities, temperature and
other sources of finite electronic lifetime are often accounted for by an
empirical broadening of the electronic energy levels. We show that the
contribution to the damping introduced by this broadening is additive, and so
can be extracted by comparing the results of the calculations performed with
and without spin-orbit interaction. Starting from simulated ferromagnetic
resonance spectra based on the underlying electronic structure, we
unambiguously demonstrate that the damping parameter obtained within the
constant broadening approximation diverges for three-dimensional bulk magnets
in the clean limit, while it remains finite for monolayers. Our work puts into
perspective the several methods available to describe and compute the Gilbert

of the detector, one possibility is to study the shadow of the Moon, i.e. the
deficit of the atmospheric muon flux from the direction of the Moon induced by
the absorption of cosmic rays. Analysing the data taken between 2007 and 2016,
the Moon shadow is observed with $3.5\sigma$ statistical significance. The
detector angular resolution for downward-going muons is
0.73$^{\circ}\pm0.14^{\circ}.$ The resulting pointing performance is consistent
with the expectations. An independent check of the telescope pointing accuracy
is realised with the data collected by a shower array detector onboard of a
ship temporarily moving around the ANTARES location.

recently been catapulted into the limelight due to their coexisting coherent
and incoherent hybrid dynamics. Here, we present a method to engineer a chimera
state by using an appropriate distribution of heterogeneous time delays on the
edges of a network. The time delays in interactions, intrinsic to natural or
artificial complex systems, are known to induce various modifications in
spatiotemporal behaviors of the coupled dynamics on networks. Using a coupled
chaotic map with the identical coupling environment, we demonstrate that
control over the spatial location of the incoherent region of a chimera state
in a network can be achieved by appropriately introducing time delays. This
method allows for the engineering of tailor-made one cluster or multi-cluster
chimera patterns. Furthermore, borrowing a measure of eigenvector localization
from the spectral graph theory, we introduce a spatial inverse participation
ratio, which provides a robust way for the identification of the chimera state.
This report highlights the necessity to consider the heterogeneous time delays
to develop applications for the chimera states in particular and understand
coupled dynamical systems in general.

nonperturbative modes are purely imaginary, we find that for fermionic field
perturbations the nonperturbative modes acquire a real part. We find that the
imaginary part of the quasinormal frequencies is always negative in both
branches; therefore, the spherical Gauss-Bonnet-AdS black holes are stable
against fermionic field perturbations.

  Image Processing and Reconstruction on Heterogeneous Devices",,,,,"cs.DC eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Medical image processing is often limited by the computational cost of the
involved algorithms. Whereas dedicated computing devices (GPUs in particular)
exist and do provide significant efficiency boosts, they have an extra cost of
use in terms of housekeeping tasks (device selection and initialization, data
streaming, synchronization with the CPU and others), which may hinder
developers from using them. This paper describes an OpenCL-based framework that
is capable of handling dedicated computing devices seamlessly and that allows
the developer to concentrate on image processing tasks.
  The framework handles automatically device discovery and initialization, data
transfers to and from the device and the file system and kernel loading and
compiling. Data structures need to be defined only once independently of the
computing device; code is unique, consequently, for every device, including the
host CPU. Pinned memory/buffer mapping is used to achieve maximum performance
in data transfers.
  Code fragments included in the paper show how the computing device is almost
immediately and effortlessly available to the users algorithms, so they can
focus on productive work. Code required for device selection and
initialization, data loading and streaming and kernel compilation is minimal
and systematic. Algorithms can be thought of as mathematical operators (called
processes), with input, output and parameters, and they may be chained one
after another easily and efficiently. Also for efficiency, processes can have
their initialization work split from their core workload, so process chains and
loops do not incur in performance penalties. Algorithm code is independent of
the device type targeted.

couplings is investigated. Dual- grid multiscale CFD-DEM couplings have been
recently developed and successfully adopted in different applications still, an
efficient parallelization for such a numerical method represents an open issue.
Despite its ability to provide grid convergent solutions and more accurate
results than standard CFD-DEM couplings, this young numerical method requires
good parallel performances in order to be applied to large-scale problems and,
therefore, extend its range of application. The parallelization strategy here
proposed aims to take advantage of the enhanced complexity of a dual-grid
coupling to gain more flexibility in the domain partitioning while keeping a
low inter-process communication cost. In particular, it allows avoiding inter-
process communication between CFD and DEM software and still allows adopting
complex partitioning strategies thanks to an optimized grid-based
communication. It is shown how the parallelized multiscale coupling holds all
its natural advantages over a mono-scale coupling and can also have better
parallel performance. Three benchmark cases are presented to assess the
accuracy and performance of the strategy. It is shown how the proposed method
allows maintaining good parallel performance when operated over 1000 processes.

is inherent to all surveys of human feelings and opinions in which subjective
responses are elicited on numerical scales. The paper also proposes a solution.
The problem is ""focal value response"" (FVR) behavior, a deep tendency by some
kinds of individuals -- particularly those with low levels of education -- to
simplify the response scale by considering only a subset of possible responses
such as the lowest, middle, and highest. This renders even the weak ordinality
assumption used with such data invalid. I show in this paper that, especially
if a researcher is trying to estimate the influence of education, the resulting
biases in inference can be overwhelmingly large. Using the application of
""happiness"" or life satisfaction data as an example, I first use a multinomial
logit model to diagnose the factors empirically associated with FVR. I then
introduce a new computational approach to estimate the bias resulting from FVR,
to correct estimates of univariate and multivariate inference, and to estimate
an index quantifying the fraction of respondents who exhibit FVR. Addressing
this problem resolves a longstanding and unexplained anomaly in the life
satisfaction literature, namely that the returns to education, after adjusting
for income, appear to be small or negative. I also show that, due to the same
econometric problem, the marginal utility of income in a subjective wellbeing
sense has been consistently underestimated by economists of happiness.

that PBH formation is easier at a specific time, i.e., when the asymptotic mass
$m_H$, acquired by the $\psi$ field at the higgs scale, becomes dominant, so
that the typical BH mass $M_{BH}$ depends on $m_H$ value. For instance, if $m_H

mechanism enhancing PBH formation also causes technical difficulties to
evaluate the transfer function of SCDEW models at high $k$. A tentative
solution of this problem leaves only minor discrepancies from $\Lambda$CDM,
also at these scales, gradually vanishing for greater $m_H$ values. We conclude
that, for suitable parameter choices, SCDEW models could be the real physics

showed that its spectral slope is slightly bluish, in agreement with its B/F

has a spin period of 3.604 hours and we found a variation of the linear
polarisation with rotation. This seems to be a rare case in which such

amplitude. Combining this new information with the brightness and colour
variation, as well as previously reported results from Arecibo radar
observations, we conclude that there is no variation of the mineralogy across

investigate the effect of diagonal coupling inspired by findings in brain
neuron connectivity. Multi-chimera states are reported both for the simple
diagonal and combined nonlocal-diagonal connectivities and we determine the
range of optimal parameter regions where chimera states appear. Overall, the
measures of coherence indicate that as the coupling range increases (below
all-to-all coupling) the emergence of chimera states is favoured and the mean
phase velocity deviations between coherent and incoherent regions become more
prominent. A number of novel synchronization phenomena are induced as a result
of the combined connectivity. We record that for coupling strengths $\sigma <
1$ the synchronous regions have mean phase velocities lower than the
asynchronous, while the opposite holds for $\sigma > 1$. In the intermediate
regime, $\sigma \sim 1$, the oscillators have common mean phase velocity (i.e.,
are frequency-locked) but different phases (i.e., they are phase-asynchronous).
Solitary states are recorded for small values of the coupling strength, which
grow into chimera states as the coupling strength increases.We determine
parameter values where the combined effects of nonlocal-diagonal coupling
generate chimera states with two different levels of synchronous domains
mediated by asynchronous regions.

this study, we investigate PCFs using full disk H{\alpha} data from 1973 to

Observatory (BBSO), in digital form from 1997 to 2018 and in 35 mm film

segmented shape and close-to-limb location were not handled well by automatical
detections in several previous studies. Our results show that the PCFs start to
move poleward at the beginning of each solar cycle. When the PCFs approach to
the maximum latitude, the polar field strength reduces to zero followed by a
reversal. The migration rates are about 0.4 to 0.7 degree per Carrington
rotation, with clear N-S asymmetric pattern. In cycles 21 and 23, the PCFs in
the northern hemisphere migrate faster than those in the southern hemisphere.
However, in the ""abnormal"" cycle 24, the southern PCFs migrate faster, which is
consistent with other observations of magnetic fields and radio emission. In
addition, there are more days in cycle 23 and 24 without PCFs than in the

the Fisher information measure have their highest (respectively lowest) values
in the Alps, where the time dynamics of wind speed follows a more disordered

environments. Typical examples include wound healing, cancer growth and embryo
development. In these crowded environments cells are able to interact with each
other in a variety of ways. These include excluded volume interactions,
adhesion, repulsion, cell signalling, pushing and pulling. One popular way to
understand the behaviour of a group of interacting cells is through an
agent-based model (ABM). A typical aim of modellers using such represtations is
to elucidate how the microscopic interactions at the cell-level impact on the
macroscopic behaviour of the population. The complex cell-cell interactions
listed above have also been incorporated into such models; all apart from
cell-cell pulling. In this paper we consider this under-represented cell-cell
interaction, in which an active cell is able to `pull' a nearby neighbour as it
moves. We incorporate a variety of potential cell-cell pulling mechanisms into
on- and off-lattice agent-based volume exclusion models of cell movement. For
each of these agent-based models we derive a continuum partial differential
equation which describes the evolution of the cells at a population-level. We
study the agreement between the ABMs and the continuum, population-based
models, and compare and contrast a range of ABMs (accounting for the different
pulling mechanisms) with each other. We find generally good agreement between
the ABMs and the corresponding continuum models that worsens as the agent-based
models become more complex. Interestingly, we observe that the partial
differential equations that we derive differ significantly, depending on
whether they were derived from on- or off-lattice ABMs of pulling. This hints
that it is important employ the appropriate ABM when representing pulling

as gravity, and their collision and coalescence efficiencies are taken to be
unity. We solve the thermodynamic equations governing temperature, water-vapor
mixing ratio, and the resulting supersaturation fields together with the
Navier-Stokes equation. We find that the droplet-size distribution broadens
with increasing Reynolds number and/or mean energy dissipation rate. Turbulence
affects the condensational growth directly through supersaturation
fluctuations, and it influences collisional growth indirectly through
condensation. Our simulations show for the first time that, in the absence of
the mean updraft cooling, supersaturation fluctuation-induced broadening of
droplet-size distributions enhances the collisional growth. This is contrary to
classical (non-turbulent) condensational growth, which leads to a growing mean
droplet size, but a narrower droplet-size distribution. Our findings, instead,
show that condensational growth facilitates collisional growth by broadening
the size distribution in the tails at an early stage of rain formation. With
increasing Reynolds numbers, evaporation becomes stronger. This counteracts the
broadening effect due to condensation at late stages of rain formation. Our
conclusions are consistent with results of laboratory experiments and field
observations, and show that supersaturation fluctuations are important for
precipitation.

High-spatial resolution observations in the millimeter range might reveal how
these stars form and how they assemble their mass. We want to study the
fragmentation process down to the 0.01~pc scale in the most massive
condensation observed at the south-western edge of the HII region RCW~120 where
the most massive Herschel cores ($\sim$124~$M_{\odot}$ in average) could form
high-mass stars. Using ALMA 3~mm continuum observations towards the densest and
most massive millimetric condensation (Condensation 1) of RCW~120, we used the
getimages and getsources algorithms to extract the sources detected with ALMA
and obtained their physical parameters. The fragmentation of the hersche cores
is discussed through their Jeans mass to understand the properties of the
future stars. We extracted 18 fragments from the ALMA continuum observation at
3~mm towards 8 cores detected with Herschel, whose mass and deconvolved size
range from 2~$M_{\odot}$ to 32~$M_{\odot}$ and from 1.6~mpc to 28.8~mpc,
respectively. The low degree of fragmentation observed, regarding to the
thermal Jeans fragmentation, suggests that the observed fragmentation is
inconsistent with ideal gravitational fragmentation and other ingredients such
as turbulence or magnetic fields should be added in order to explain it.
Finally, the range of fragments' mass indicates that the densest condensation
of RCW~120 is a favourable place for the formation of high-mass stars with the
presence of a probable UCHII region associated with the 27~$M_{\odot}$ Fragment
1 of Core 2.

techniques to deliver numerical solutions of parametrized PDEs in real-time
performance with reasonable accuracy. For incompressible flow problems, RBMs
based on LBB stable velocity-pressure spaces do not generally inherit the
stability of the underlying high-fidelity model and, instead, additional
stabilization techniques must be introduced. One way of bypassing the loss of
LBB stability in the RBM is to inflate the velocity space with supremizer
modes. This however deteriorates the performance of the RBM in the
performance-critical online stage, as additional DOFs must be introduced to
retain stability, while these DOFs do not effectively contribute to accuracy of
the RB approximation. In this work we consider a velocity-only RB
approximation, exploiting a solenoidal velocity basis. The solenoidal reduced
basis emerges directly from the high-fidelity velocity solutions in the offline
stage. By means of Piola transforms, the solenoidality of the velocity space is
retained under geometric transformations, making the proposed RB method
suitable also for the investigation of geometric parameters. To ensure exact
solenoidality of the high-fidelity velocity solutions that constitute the RB,
we consider approximations based on divergence-conforming compatible B-splines.
We show that the velocity-only RB method leads to a significant improvement in
computational efficiency in the online stage, and that the pressure solution
can be recovered a posteriori at negligible extra cost. We illustrate the
solenoidal RB approach by modeling steady two-dimensional Navier-Stokes flow

nightly rotational variability and seasonal changes in bulk morphology. We
determined a rotational pole direction of RA/Dec = 81/+29 with an obliquity of

at lat/long +77/245 and a 20 deg radius, 4 times larger than the eastern

some dust features. Water morphology, based on OH, was quite different than
that of the carbon-bearing species, implying a different driver for the polar
jets such as CO or CO2. Ion tails were detected in decontaminated images from
both the dust and NH filters, likely being H2O+ and OH+, respectively. We

in order for the Cesaro means to converge weakly to some bounded regular

a set of algebraic equations of the functional Bethe Ansatz method by a single

is demonstrated for a number of quasi-exactly solvable (QES) potentials of the
Schr\""odinger equation, such as two different sets of modified Manning
potentials with three parameters, an electron in Coulomb and magnetic fields
and relative motion of two electrons in an external oscillator potential, the
hyperbolic Razavy potential, and a (perturbed) double sinh-Gordon system. The
approach enables one to straightforwardly determine eigenvalues and wave
functions. Odd parity solutions for the modified Manning potentials are also
determined. For the QES examples considered here, constraint polynomials
terminate a finite chain of orthogonal polynomials in an independent variable
that need not to be necessarily energy. In the majority of cases the finite
chain of orthogonal polynomials is characterized by a positive-definite moment
functional ${\cal L}$, implying that a corresponding constraint polynomial has
only real and simple zeros. Constraint polynomials are shown to be different
from the weak orthogonal Bender-Dunne polynomials. At the same time the QES
examples considered elucidate essential difference with various generalizations
of the Rabi model. Whereas in the former case there are $n+1$ polynomial
solutions at each point of a $n$th baseline, in the latter case there are at
most $n+1$ polynomial solutions on entire $n$th baseline.

system amenable to efficient Gibbs sampling. We show that in the absence of
photometric information, this method reduces to commonly used clustering
redshift estimators. Using a simple model system, we show how the incorporation
of clustering information with photo-$z$'s tightens redshift posteriors, and
can overcome biases or gaps in the coverage of a spectroscopic prior. The
method enables the full propagation of redshift uncertainties into cosmological
analyses, and uses all the information at hand to reduce those uncertainties

predict at a high speed the expected TDOS associated with the second stage

consists of a large number of deterministic operational problems generated by
controlled probabilistic sampling. The labels are computed based on solutions
to these problems (solved independently and offline), employing appropriate
aggregation and subselection methods to address uncertainty. Results on our

communicate. When sensing, an agent measures (in additive gaussian noise)
linear combinations of the unknown vector of parameters. When communicating, an
agent can broadcast information to a few other agents, by using the channels
that happen to be randomly at its disposal at the time.
  To coordinate the agents towards their estimation goal, we propose a novel
algorithm called FADE (Fast and Asymptotically efficient Distributed
Estimator), in which agents collaborate at discrete time-steps; at each
time-step, agents sense and communicate just once, while also updating their
own estimate of the unknown vector of parameters.
  FADE enjoys five attractive features: first, it is an intuitive estimator,
simple to derive; second, it withstands dynamic networks, that is, networks
whose communication channels change randomly over time; third, it is strongly
consistent in that, as time-steps play out, each agent's local estimate
converges (almost surely) to the true vector of parameters; fourth, it is both
asymptotically unbiased and efficient, which means that, across time, each
agent's estimate becomes unbiased and the mean-square error (MSE) of each
agent's estimate vanishes to zero at the same rate of the MSE of the optimal
estimator at an almighty central node; fifth, and most importantly, when
compared with a state-of-art consensus+innovation (CI) algorithm, it yields
estimates with outstandingly lower mean-square errors, for the same number of
communications -- for example, in a sparsely connected network model with 50
agents, we find through numerical simulations that the reduction can be
dramatic, reaching several orders of magnitude.

terrestrial accelerator neutrinos, we calculate their approximate expressions
from which we prove that, at medium baselines, the CPT-odd component is small

CP asymmetry as a theoretical background, provided the hierarchy is known. At
long baselines, on the other hand, we find that (i) a Hierarchy-odd term in the

thus provide separate information on (i) the neutrino mass ordering, and (ii)
direct evidence of genuine CP violation in the lepton sector.

The theory assumes that one can easily compute an unbiased gradient estimator,
which is usually the case due to the sample average nature of empirical risk
minimization. There exist, however, many scenarios (e.g., graphs) where an
unbiased estimator may be as expensive to compute as the full gradient because
training examples are interconnected. Recently, Chen et al. (2018) proposed
using a consistent gradient estimator as an economic alternative. Encouraged by
empirical success, we show, in a general setting, that consistent estimators
result in the same convergence behavior as do unbiased ones. Our analysis
covers strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex objectives. We verify the results
with illustrative experiments on synthetic and real-world data. This work opens
several new research directions, including the development of more efficient

capabilities of Gaia DR2 measurements to search for Sco OB2 members across its

and photometric data to select association members, using minimal assumptions
derived mostly from the Hipparcos studies. Gaia resolves small details in both
the kinematics of individual Sco OB2 subgroups and their distances from the
Sun. We develop methods to explore the 3D kinematics of stellar populations
covering large sky areas. We find ~11000 pre-main sequence (PMS) Sco OB2
members (with <3% contamination), plus ~3600 MS candidate members with a larger
(10-30%) field-star contamination. A higher-confidence subsample of ~9200 PMS
(and ~1340 MS) members is also selected (<1% contamination for the PMS),
affected however by larger (~15%) incompleteness. We classify separately stars
in compact and diffuse populations. Most members belong to a few kinematically
distinct diffuse populations, whose ensemble outlines the association shape.
Upper Sco is the densest part of Sco OB2, with a complex spatial and
kinematical structure, and no global pattern of motion. Other dense subclusters
are found in Upper Centaurus-Lupus and in Lower Centaurus-Crux. Most clustered
stars appear to be younger than the diffuse PMS population, suggesting star
formation in small groups which rapidly disperse and dilute, while keeping
memory of their original kinematics. We also find that the open cluster IC 2602
has a similar dynamics to Sco OB2, and its PMS members are evaporating and
forming a ~10 deg halo around its double-peaked core.

relativity framework (applied in $v$-space according to de Montera's proposal).
We first review some of the various ingredients which are at the heart of the
scale relativity approach (scale dependence and fractality, chaotic paths,
irreversibility) and recall that they indeed characterize fully developped
turbulent flows. Then we show that, in this framework, the time derivative of
the Navier-Stokes equation can be transformed into a macroscopic
Schr\""odinger-like equation. The local velocity PDF is given by the squared
modulus of a solution of this equation. This implies the presence of null
minima $P_v(v_i)\approx 0$ in this PDF. We also predict a new acceleration
component in Lagrangian representation, $A_q=\pm D_v \: d \ln P_v/dv$, which is
therefore expected to diverge in these minima. Then we check these theoretical
predictions by data analysis of available turbulence experiments: (1) Empty
zones are in effect detected in observed Lagrangian velocity PDFs. (2) We give
a direct proof of the existence of the new acceleration component by directly
identifying it in the data of a laboratory turbulence experiment. (3) It
precisely accounts for the bursts and calm periods of the intermittent
acceleration observed in experiments. (4) Moreover, the shape of the
acceleration PDF can be analytically predicted from $A_q$, and this theoretical
PDF precisely fits the experimental data, including the large tails. (5)
Finally, numerical simulations of this new process allow us to recover the
observed autocorrelation functions of acceleration magnitude and the exponents
of structure functions.

TEM and STEM techniques that enable the structural analysis of electron
beam-sensitive and weakly scattering nano-materials. Here, we demonstrate such
a technique, STEM holography, capable of absolute phase and amplitude object
wave measurement with respect to a vacuum reference wave. We use an
amplitude-dividing nanofabricated grating to prepare multiple spatially
separated electron diffraction probe beams focused at the sample plane, such
that one beam transmits through the specimen while the others pass through
vacuum. We raster-scan the diffracted probes over the region of interest. We
configure the post specimen imaging system of the microscope to diffraction
mode, overlapping the probes to form an interference pattern at the detector.
Using a fast-readout, direct electron detector, we record and analyze the
interference fringes at each position in a 2D raster scan to reconstruct the
complex transfer function of the specimen, t(x). We apply this technique to
image a standard target specimen consisting of gold nanoparticles on a thin
amorphous carbon substrate, and demonstrate 2.4 angstrom resolution phase
images. We find that STEM holography offers higher phase-contrast of the
amorphous material while maintaining Au atomic lattice resolution when compared
with high angle annular dark field STEM.

differential intracellular signaling and steroidogenesis. The mechanistic basis
of such differential responses remains mostly unknown. Here, we compared the
abilities of recombinant rhLH and rhCG to elicit cAMP, \beta-arrestin 2
activation, and steroidogenesis in HEK293 cells and mouse Leydig tumor cells

indicate that rhLH and rhCG differentially promote cell responses mediated by

kinetics: rhCG was more potent than rhLH in both HEK293 and mLTC-1 cells.
Interestingly, partial effects of rhLH were found on \beta-arrestin recruitment
and on progesterone production compared to rhCG. Such a link was further
supported by knockdown experiments. These pharmacological differences
demonstrate that rhLH and rhCG act as natural biased agonists. The discovery of

essential for reproduction. It specifically binds to a membrane receptor (FSHR)
expressed in somatic cells of the gonads. The FSH/FSHR system presents many
peculiarities compared to classical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). FSH is
a large naturally heterogeneous heterodimeric glycoprotein. The FSHR is
characterized by a very large NH2-terminal extracellular domain, which binds
the FSH and participates to the activation/inactivation switch of the receptor.
Once activated, the FSHR couples to G{\alpha}s and, in some instances, to other
G{\alpha} subunits. G protein-coupled receptor kinases and \beta-arrestins are
also recruited to the FSHR and account for its desensitization, the control of
its trafficking and its intracellular signalling. Of note, the FSHR
internalization and recycling are very fast and involve very early endosomes
instead of early endosomes. All the transduction mechanisms triggered upon FSH
stimulation lead to the activation of a complex signalling network that
controls gene expression by acting at multiple levels. The integration of these
mechanisms leads to context-adapted responses from the target gonadal cells,
but also indirectly affects the fate of germ cells. Depending of the
physiological/developmental stage, FSH elicits proliferation, differentiation
or apoptosis in order to maintain the homeostasis of the reproductive system.
Pharmacological tools targeting FSHR recently came to the fore and open
promising prospects both for basic research and therapeutic applications. This
paper provides an updated review of the most salient aspects and peculiarities

radio and X-ray studies ($\mathcal{M}_{\rm RN}=2.58\pm0.17$ and
$\mathcal{M}_{\rm RS}=2.10\pm0.08$). However, color-color diagrams and
modelings suggest a flatter injection spectral index than the one obtained from
the spectral index map, indicating that projection effects might be not
entirely negligible. The southern relic consists of five ""arms"". Embedded in
it, we find a tailed radio galaxy which seems to be connected to the relic. A
spectral index flattening, where the radio tail connects to the relic, is also

methodology is used for stability analysis. As for deriving formulas for the
asymptotic average of both capacitor voltage and inductor current, a new simple
analytic method is introduced. It was shown analytically that the time average
of capacitor voltage converges to half of the source voltage. A formula for the
time average of the current of the inductor is also computed. As a by-product
it was discovered that the period of the current is half of the switching
period. Numerical simulations are obtained to illustrate the accuracy of the
results. Higher dimensional generalisations could become a bit complicated as
stability analysis of higher dimensional exponential matrices are not so easy
to handle. On the other hand, the new discovery on the period of the current is
more likely to give new insights in handling higher dimensional systems.

activity recognition applications. However, in the face of modern artificial
intelligence sensor-based games, many research achievements cannot be
practically applied on portable devices. DCNNs are typically resource-intensive
and too large to be deployed on portable devices, thus this limits the
practical application of complex activity detection. In addition, since
portable devices do not possess high-performance Graphic Processing Units
(GPUs), there is hardly any improvement in Action Game (ACT) experience.
Besides, in order to deal with multi-sensor collaboration, all previous human
activity recognition models typically treated the representations from
different sensor signal sources equally. However, distinct types of activities
should adopt different fusion strategies. In this paper, a novel scheme is
proposed. This scheme is used to train 2-bit Convolutional Neural Networks with
weights and activations constrained to {-0.5,0,0.5}. It takes into account the
correlation between different sensor signal sources and the activity types.
This model, which we refer to as DFTerNet, aims at producing a more reliable
inference and better trade-offs for practical applications. Our basic idea is
to exploit quantization of weights and activations directly in pre-trained
filter banks and adopt dynamic fusion strategies for different activity types.
Experiments demonstrate that by using dynamic fusion strategy can exceed the
baseline model performance by up to ~5% on activity recognition like
OPPORTUNITY and PAMAP2 datasets. Using the quantization method proposed, we
were able to achieve performances closer to that of full-precision counterpart.
These results were also verified using the UniMiB-SHAR dataset. In addition,
the proposed method can achieve ~9x acceleration on CPUs and ~11x memory
saving.

B 99, 041401 (2019)","10.1103/PhysRevB.99.041401",,"cond-mat.mes-hall physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this Letter we study the generation of quasi-static magnetic fields by the
plasmon-induced inverse Faraday effect and propose a magneto-optical waveguide
structure for achieving magnetization switching at sub-ps time in a
nano-confined magneto-optical structure. In particular we show that the
direction of the generated quasi-static field in a magneto-optical dielectric
cavity side-coupled to a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguide depends
sensitively on the wavelength of the surface plasmon polaritions (SPP). This
phenomenon could open up a new energy-efficient ultrafast method for
nano-confined all-optical magnetization switching by two-frequency pulses.

  Network in Embedded FPGA","Accepted by International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and
  Applications (FPL'2018)",,,,"cs.DC cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural network accelerators with low latency and low energy consumption are
desirable for edge computing. To create such accelerators, we propose a design
flow for accelerating the extremely low bit-width neural network (ELB-NN) in
embedded FPGAs with hybrid quantization schemes. This flow covers both network
training and FPGA-based network deployment, which facilitates the design space
exploration and simplifies the tradeoff between network accuracy and
computation efficiency. Using this flow helps hardware designers to deliver a
network accelerator in edge devices under strict resource and power
constraints. We present the proposed flow by supporting hybrid ELB settings
within a neural network. Results show that our design can deliver very high
performance peaking at 10.3 TOPS and classify up to 325.3 image/s/watt while
running large-scale neural networks for less than 5W using embedded FPGA. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the most energy efficient solution in
comparison to GPU or other FPGA implementations reported so far in the
literature.

crossed magnetic fields owing to the momentum transfer between the macroscopic
degrees of freedom for the plasma flow was studied. Based on these results, we
have discussed the acceleration of plasma flow containing the charged
macroscopic particles. The estimates presented make it possible to draw a
tentative conclusion about the axial acceleration of the dusty plasma flows.

(RP) of Quantum Dots (QDs) are highly sensitive to their nearby surrounding
material. To enhance the RDR and shape the RP, interspacing between the QDs and
their distances from discontinuities caused by multi-layered environment in
which they are immersed, must be controlled with nanoscale accuracy. State of
the art in QD based micro-display has so far ignored these aspects of
light-matter interaction in pixel design and therefore has been unable to
harness the full potential of QDs in pixel size reduction. I propose a novel
pixel technology for dynamic micro-displays with novel capabilities such as (1)
Each submicron pixel being operable electrically yet independently (i.e. the
ability of turning a pixel on/off being independent from the neighboring
pixels, hence the infinite contrast ratio. (2) Highly directional light being
emitted from each pixel and (3) Increased quantum yield and luminescence while
decreasing the number of QDs per pixel, hence minimizing the power consumption
