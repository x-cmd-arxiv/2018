  Topological Features",,,,,"quant-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-Hermitian singularities are ubiquitous in non-conservative open systems.
These singularities are often points of measure zero in the eigenspectrum of
the system which make them difficult to access without careful engineering.
Despite that, they can remotely induce observable effects when some of the
system's parameters are varied along closed trajectories in the parameter
space. To date, a general formalism for describing this process beyond simple
cases is still lacking. Here, we bridge this gap and develop a general approach
for treating this problem by utilizing the power of permutation operators and
representation theory. This in turn allows us to reveal the following
surprising result which contradicts the common belief in the field: loops that
enclose the same singularities starting from the same initial point and
traveling in the same direction, do not necessarily share the same end outcome.
Interestingly, we find that this equivalence can be formally established only
by invoking the topological notion of homotopy. Our findings are general with
far reaching implications in various fields ranging from photonics and atomic
physics to microwaves and acoustics.

score the probability of belonging to different classes. We train such a
Capsule Projection Network (CapProNet) by learning an orthogonal projection
matrix for each capsule subspace, and show that each capsule subspace is
updated until it contains input feature vectors corresponding to the associated
class. We will also show that the capsule projection can be viewed as
normalizing the multiple columns of the weight matrix simultaneously to form an
orthogonal basis, which makes it more effective in incorporating novel
components of input features to update capsule representations. In other words,
the capsule projection can be viewed as a multi-dimensional weight
normalization in capsule subspaces, where the conventional weight normalization
is simply a special case of the capsule projection onto 1D lines. Only a small
negligible computing overhead is incurred to train the network in
low-dimensional capsule subspaces or through an alternative hyper-power
iteration to estimate the normalization matrix. Experiment results on image
datasets show the presented model can greatly improve the performance of the
state-of-the-art ResNet backbones by $10-20\%$ and that of the Densenet by
$5-7\%$ respectively at the same level of computing and memory expenses. The
CapProNet establishes the competitive state-of-the-art performance for the
family of capsule nets by significantly reducing test errors on the benchmark

an offline trained face verifier based on deep convolutional neural networks

arbitrarily across natural psychological taxonomies (e.g., dogs are separated
into breeds, but never jointly categorized as ""dogs""), and bias the resulting

However, in any physically reasonable situation this is impossible. We collect
different scenarios of such a kind and show why in every act of collision
$E_{c.m.}$ is indeed finite (although it can be as large as one likes). The
factors preventing infinite energy are diverse: the necessity of infinite
proper time, infinite tidal forces, potential barrier, etc. This prompts us to
formulate a general principle according to which the limits in which $E_{c.m.}$
becomes infinite are never achieved. We call this the kinematic censorship
(KC). Although by itself the validity of KC is quite natural, its application
allows one to forbid scenarios of collisions predicting infinite $E_{c.m.}$
without going into details. The KC is valid even in the test particle
approximation, so explanation of why $E_{c.m.}$ cannot be infinite, does not
require references (common in literature) to the non-linear regime,
backreaction, etc. The KC remains valid not only for free moving particles but
also if particles experience the action of a finite force. For an individual
particle, we consider a light-like continuous limit of a time-like trajectory
in which the effective mass turns into zero. We show that it cannot be
accelerated to an infinite energy during a finite proper time under the action
of such a force. As an example, we consider dynamics of a scalar particle
interacting with a background scalar field.

Bayesian tree-based model for nonparametric regression. The goal of tsBART is
to introduce smoothness over a single target covariate t, while not necessarily
requiring smoothness over other covariates x. TsBART is based on the Bayesian
Additive Regression Trees (BART) model, an ensemble of regression trees. TsBART
extends BART by parameterizing each tree's terminal nodes with smooth functions
of t, rather than independent scalars. Like BART, tsBART captures complex
nonlinear relationships and interactions among the predictors. But unlike BART,
tsBART guarantees that the response surface will be smooth in the target
covariate. This improves interpretability and helps regularize the estimate.
  After introducing and benchmarking the tsBART model, we apply it to our
motivating example: pregnancy outcomes data from the National Center for Health
Statistics. Our aim is to provide patient-specific estimates of stillbirth risk
across gestational age (t), based on maternal and fetal risk factors (x).
Obstetricians expect stillbirth risk to vary smoothly over gestational age, but
not necessarily over other covariates, and tsBART has been designed precisely
to reflect this structural knowledge. The results of our analysis show the
clear superiority of the tsBART model for quantifying stillbirth risk, thereby
providing patients and doctors with better information for managing the risk of
perinatal mortality. All methods described here are implemented in the R

defined by the activity between consecutive silent states. We claim that the
latter definition may be extended to some theoretical models to characterize
their power-law avalanches and critical behavior. We study a system in which
the separation of driving and relaxation time scales emerges from its
structure. We apply both definitions of avalanche to our model. Both yield
power-law-distributed avalanches that scale with system size in the critical
point as expected. Nevertheless, we find restricted power-law-distributed
avalanches outside of the critical region within the experimental procedure,
which is not expected by the standard theoretical definition. We remark that
these results are dependent on the model details.

  using Dynamic Fog",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) has emerged as a promising solution for
enhancing road safety. Routing of messages in VANET is challenging due to
packet delays arising from high mobility of vehicles, frequently changing
topology, and high density of vehicles, leading to frequent route breakages and
packet losses. Previous researchers have used either mobility in vehicular fog
computing or cloud computing to solve the routing issue, but they suffer from
large packet delays and frequent packet losses. We propose Dynamic Fog for
Connected Vehicles (DFCV), a fog computing based scheme which dynamically
creates, increments and destroys fog nodes depending on the communication
needs. The novelty of DFCV lies in providing lower delays and guaranteed
message delivery at high vehicular densities. Simulations were conducted using
hybrid simulation consisting of ns-2, SUMO, and Cloudsim. Results show that
DFCV ensures efficient resource utilization, lower packet delays and losses at
high vehicle densities.

Our sample stars were preselected among early-type variables using light curve
morphology criteria. Spectroscopic information was gleaned from the literature,
and archival and newly-acquired spectra. Photometric variability was analyzed
using archival ASAS-3 time series data. To enable a comparison of results, we
have largely adopted the methodology of Labadie-Bartz et al. (2017), who
carried out a similar investigation based on KELT data. Complex photometric
variations were established in most stars: outbursts on different time-scales
(in 73$\pm$5% of stars), long-term variations (36$\pm$6%), periodic variations
on intermediate time-scales (1$\pm$1%) and short-term periodic variations
(6$\pm$3%). 24$\pm$6% of the outbursting stars exhibit (semi)periodic
outbursts. We close the apparent void of rare outbursters reported by
Labadie-Bartz et al. (2017) and show that Be stars with infrequent outbursts
are not rare. While we do not find a significant difference in the percentage
of stars showing outbursts among early-type, mid-type and late-type Be stars,
we show that early-type Be stars exhibit much more frequent outbursts. We have
measured rising and falling times for well-covered and well-defined outbursts.
Nearly all outburst events are characterized by falling times that exceed the
rising times. No differences were found between early-, mid- and late-type
stars; a single non-linear function adequately describes the ratio of falling
time to rising time across all spectral subtypes, with the ratio being larger
for short events.

it is shown that the category of quivers embeds into the category of incidence

shown to be simply represented using incidence hypergraph homomorphisms.

Our goal is the rigorous derivation of the effective dielectric permittivity of

the $\ell_1$ norm of a matrix $D$ times the coefficient vector. We derive a
broad result on uniqueness that places weak assumptions on the predictor matrix
$X$ and penalty matrix $D$; the implication is that, if $D$ is fixed and its
null space is not too large (the dimension of its null space is at most the
number of samples), and $X$ and response vector $y$ jointly follow an
absolutely continuous distribution, then the generalized lasso problem has a
unique solution almost surely, regardless of the number of predictors relative
to the number of samples. This effectively generalizes previous uniqueness
results for the lasso problem (which corresponds to the special case $D=I$).
Further, we extend our study to the case in which the loss is given by the
negative log-likelihood from a generalized linear model. In addition to
uniqueness results, we derive results on the local stability of generalized
lasso solutions that might be of interest in their own right.

This may not be optimal for the hierarchical GCN and diverse samples in action

frequency, even making the network alternated between the synchronous and

a detailed analysis on the influence of coupling frequency on network

some characteristic frequencies comparable to the intrinsic frequency of the

technique of finite-time Lyapunov exponent, we investigate further the
mechanism for the maximized synchronizability, and find that at the

exponent is abruptly changed from the localized to broad distributions. When
this feature is absent or not prominent, the network synchronizability is less

modulating drug response. A recent screening of ~1,000 cancer cell lines to a
collection of anti-cancer drugs illuminated the link between genotypes and
vulnerability. However, due to essential differences between cell lines and
tumors, the translation into predicting drug response in tumors remains
challenging. Here we proposed a DNN model to predict drug response based on
mutation and expression profiles of a cancer cell or a tumor. The model
contains a mutation and an expression encoders pre-trained using a large
pan-cancer dataset to abstract core representations of high-dimension data,
followed by a drug response predictor network. Given a pair of mutation and
expression profiles, the model predicts IC50 values of 265 drugs. We trained
and tested the model on a dataset of 622 cancer cell lines and achieved an
overall prediction performance of mean squared error at 1.96 (log-scale IC50
values). The performance was superior in prediction error or stability than two
classical methods and four analog DNNs of our model. We then applied the model
to predict drug response of 9,059 tumors of 33 cancer types. The model
predicted both known, including EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer
and tamoxifen in ER+ breast cancer, and novel drug targets. The comprehensive
analysis further revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance to
a chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel in a pan-cancer setting and the anti-cancer
potential of a novel agent, CX-5461, in treating gliomas and hematopoietic
malignancies. Overall, our model and findings improve the prediction of drug
response and the identification of novel therapeutic options.

real-time SLAM. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep neural
network architecture of a feature embedding for visual loop closure that is
both reliable and compact. Our model is built upon the autoencoder
architecture, tailored specifically to the problem at hand. To train our
network, we inflict random noise on our input data as the denoising autoencoder
does, but, instead of applying random dropout, we warp images with randomized
projective transformations to emulate natural viewpoint changes due to robot
motion. Moreover, we utilize the geometric information and illumination
invariance provided by histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), forcing the
encoder to reconstruct a HOG descriptor instead of the original image. As a
result, our trained model extracts features robust to extreme variations in
appearance directly from raw images, without the need for labeled training data
or environment-specific training. We perform extensive experiments on various
challenging datasets, showing that the proposed deep loop-closure model
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness
and efficiency. Our model is fast and reliable enough to close loops in real

off-the-shelf networks in state-of-the-art ConvNet-based loop closure systems.

with a photon index of $\Gamma=1.63\pm0.02$ and a low coronal temperature of
$kT_{\rm e}=22\pm1$ keV, corresponding to a low spectral cutoff well
constrained by NuSTAR. Spectral modeling of the relativistic disk reflection
features, consisting of a broad Fe K$\alpha$ line and the Compton reflection
hump, reveals that the black hole is rapidly spinning with the spin parameter
of $a^{*}>0.96$, and the inner accretion disk is viewed at a high inclination
angle of $i=64^{+2}_{-3}{^\circ}$ (statistical errors, 90% confidence). The
high inclination is independently confirmed by dips in the light curves, which
can be explained by absorbing material located near the disk plane temporarily
obscuring the central region. In addition, we detect an absorption line in the
NuSTAR spectra centered at $7.03^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ keV. If associated with
ionized Fe K absorption lines, this provides evidence for the presence of
outflowing material in the low/hard state of a black hole binary candidate. A
timing analysis shows the presence of a type-C QPO in the power spectrum, with
the frequency increasing from $\sim0.14$ Hz to $\sim0.21$ Hz during the single

crucial to guarantee the safety of an agent during training as well as

algorithms under the framework of constrained Markov decision problems (CMDPs),
an extension of the standard Markov decision problems (MDPs) augmented with

signal size is as expected based on calculation, and the EMTs show a
sufficiently fast time response for bunch-by-bunch beam monitoring. The
spill-by-spill intensity resolution is 0.4%, better than the required value
(1%). Signal linearity within $\pm$1% is achieved at proton beam powers up to
460 kW (with +250 kA focusing horn operation). A gradual signal decrease was
observed during the initial exposure, due to the stabilization of dynode
materials, before the response became stable within $\pm$1%. This work
demonstrates that EMTs are a good candidate for future muon monitoring at T2K,

in the construction of physical hadrons, which are color singlets, in an
analogous manner to valence quarks. Hadrons with no valence quarks are called
glueballs, while hadrons where both gluons and valence quarks combine to form a
color singlet are called hybrids. The unambiguous identification of such states
among the experimental hadron spectrum has been thus far not possible.
Glueballs are particularly difficult to establish experimentally since the
lowest lying ones are expected to strongly mix with conventional mesons. On the
other hand, hybrids should be easier to single out because the set of quantum
numbers available to their lowest excitations may be exotic, i.e., not realized
in conventional quark-antiquark systems. Particularly promising for discovery
appear to be heavy hybrids, which are made of gluons and a
heavy-quark-antiquark pair (charm or bottom). In the heavy-quark sector
systematic tools can be used that are not available in the light-quark sector.
In this paper we use a nonrelativistic effective field theory to uncover for
the first time the full spin structure of heavy-quark hybrids up to
$1/m^2$-terms in the heavy-quark-mass expansion. We show that such terms
display novel characteristics at variance with our consolidated experience on
the fine and hyperfine splittings in atomic, molecular and nuclear physics. We
determine the nonperturbative contributions to the matching coefficients of the
effective field theory by fitting our results to lattice-QCD determinations of
the charmonium hybrid spectrum and extrapolate the results to the bottomonium
hybrid sector where lattice-QCD determinations are still challenging.

may adopt cache locality-aware warp scheduling which gives higher execution
priority to warps with higher potential of data locality. However, we observe
that warps with high potential of data locality often incurs far more cache
thrashing or interference than warps with low potential of data locality.
Consequently, cache locality-aware warp scheduling may undesirably increase
cache interference and/or unnecessarily decrease TLP. In this paper, we propose
Cache Interference-Aware throughput-Oriented (CIAO) on-chip memory architecture
and warp scheduling which exploit unused shared memory space and take insight
opposite to cache locality-aware warp scheduling. Specifically, CIAO on-chip
memory architecture can adaptively redirect memory requests of severely
interfering warps to unused shared memory space to isolate memory requests of
these interfering warps from those of interfered warps. If these interfering
warps still incur severe cache interference, CIAO warp scheduling then begins
to selectively throttle execution of these interfering warps. Our experiment
shows that CIAO can offer 54% higher performance than prior cache

problem.Typically, a meta-learner is trained on a variety of tasks in the hopes
of being generalizable to new tasks. However, the generalizability on new tasks
of a meta-learner could be fragile when it is over-trained on existing tasks
during meta-training phase. In other words, the initial model of a meta-learner
could be too biased towards existing tasks to adapt to new tasks, especially
when only very few examples are available to update the model. To avoid a
biased meta-learner and improve its generalizability, we propose a novel
paradigm of Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning (TAML) algorithms. Specifically, we
present an entropy-based approach that meta-learns an unbiased initial model
with the largest uncertainty over the output labels by preventing it from
over-performing in classification tasks. Alternatively, a more general
inequality-minimization TAML is presented for more ubiquitous scenarios by
directly minimizing the inequality of initial losses beyond the classification
tasks wherever a suitable loss can be defined.Experiments on benchmarked
datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches outperform compared
meta-learning algorithms in both few-shot classification and reinforcement

higher frequency bands, we investigate the problem of path selection and rate
allocation for multi-hop self-backhaul millimeter wave (mmWave) networks.
Enabling multi-hop mmWave transmissions raises a potential issue of increased
latency, and thus, in this work we aim at addressing the fundamental questions:
how to select the best multi-hop paths and how to allocate rates over these
paths subject to latency constraints? In this regard, we propose a new system
design, which exploits multiple antenna diversity, mmWave bandwidth, and
traffic splitting techniques to improve the downlink transmission. The studied
problem is cast as a network utility maximization, subject to an upper delay
bound constraint, network stability, and network dynamics. By leveraging
stochastic optimization, the problem is decoupled into: path selection and rate
allocation sub-problems, whereby a framework which selects the best paths is
proposed using reinforcement learning techniques. Moreover, the rate allocation
is a nonconvex program, which is converted into a convex one by using the
successive convex approximation method. Via mathematical analysis, we provide a
comprehensive performance analysis and convergence proofs for the proposed
solution. Numerical results show that our approach ensures reliable
communication with a guaranteed probability of up to $99.9999\%$, and reduces
latency by $50.64\%$ and $92.9\%$ as compared to baseline models. Furthermore,
the results showcase the key trade-off between latency and network arrival
rate.

the highest ventilation volume, present in nature. Such performance is
attributed to a functional unit of gill - secondary lamella - that can extract
oxygen from an ambience even at a very low partial pressure. For centuries,
gills have stood as one of the simplest but an elegant gas/solute exchange
organs. Although the role of various morphometric factors of fish gills on
gas/solute exchange capabilities have been reported, there has been limited
understanding on what makes fish gills as an excellent gas/solute exchange
system. Therefore, in the current study, we have theoretically studied the
variation of few structural and parametric ratios, which were known to have
role in gas/solute exchange, with respect to the weight of fishes. Thereafter,
modelling and simulation of convection-diffusion transport through a two
dimensional model of secondary lamella were carried out to study different
factors affecting the performance of gills. The results obtained from both the
studies (theoretical and computational) were in good agreement with each other.
Thus, our study suggested that fish gills have optimized parametric ratios, at
multiple length scales, throughout an evolution to arrive at an organ with
enhanced mass transport capabilities. Further, our study also highlighted the
role of length of primary and secondary lamella, surface area of secondary
lamellae and inter-lamellar distance on gas/solute exchange capabilities of
fish gills. Thus, these defined morphological parameters and parametric ratios
could be exploited in future to design and develop efficient gas/solute
exchange microdevices.

comprised of regular and irregular components, which makes uncovering the
complexity of network structures to be a fundamental challenge. Exploring the
regular information and identifying the roles of microscopic elements in
network data can help us recognize the principle of network organization and
contribute to network data utilization. However, the intrinsic structural
properties of networks remain so far inadequately explored and theorised. With
the realistic assumption that there are consistent features across the local
structures of networks, we propose a low-rank pursuit based self-representation
network model, in which the principle of network organization can be uncovered
by a representation matrix. According to this model, original true networks can
be reconstructed based on the observed unreliable network topology. In
particular, the proposed model enables us to estimate the extent to which the
networks are regulable, i.e., measuring the reconstructability of networks. In
addition, the model is capable of measuring the importance of microscopic
network elements, i.e., nodes and links, in terms of network regularity thereby
allowing us to regulate the reconstructability of networks based on them.
Extensive experiments on disparate real-world networks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed network reconstruction and regulation algorithm.
Specifically, the network regularity metric can reflect the reconstructability
of networks, and the reconstruction accuracy can be improved by removing
irregular network links. Lastly, our approach provides an unique and novel
insight into the organization exploring of complex networks.

analysis of the long timescale variability. Adopting a power-law form for the
variability structure function, $V=A(t/1yr)^{\gamma}$, we use the
multi-dimensional parametric fitting to explore the relationships between the
quasar variability amplitude and a wide variety of quasar properties, including
redshift (positive), bolometric luminosity (negative), rest-frame wavelength
(negative), and black hole mass (uncertain). We also find that $\gamma$ can be
also expressed as a function of redshift (negative), bolometric luminosity
(positive), rest-frame wavelength (positive), and black hole mass (positive).
Tests of the fitting significance with the bootstrap method show that, even
with such a large quasar sample, some correlations are marginally significant.
The typical value of $\gamma$ for the entire dataset is $\gtrsim 0.25$,
consistent with the results in previous studies on both the quasar ensemble
variability and the structure function. A significantly negative correlation
between the variability amplitude and the Eddington ratio is found, which may
be explained as an effect of accretion disk instability.

relationship to families of stochastic particle systems such as the Dyson model

unnoticed after the initial work of Gallardo, Yor and Chybiryakov. We study the

the jump processes of types $A_{N-1}$ and $B_N$ undergo a phase transition when
the parameter $\beta$ decreases toward one in the bulk scaling limit. In

mode design. The proposed method tunes the two gains of STA on line
simultaneously such that a second order sliding mode can take place with small
rectifying gains. The perturbation magnitude is obtained exactly by employing a
third-order sliding mode observer in opposition to the conventional
approximations by using a first order low pass filter. While driving the
sliding variable to the sliding mode surface, one gain of the STA automatically
converges to an adjacent area of the perturbation magnitude in finite time. The
other gain is adjusted by the above gain to guarantee the robustness of the
STA. This method requires only one parameter to be adjusted. The adjustment is
straightforward because it just keeps increasing until it fulfills the
convergence constraints. For large values of the parameter, chattering in the
update law of the two gains is avoided by employing a geometry based backward
Euler integration method. The usefulness is illustrated by an example of
designing an equivalent control based sliding mode control (ECBC-SMC) with the
proposed adaptive STA for a perturbed LTI system.

throughput. After channel model formulation, user information rates are
allocated and decoding order for all the received data layers is obtained by
solving a max-min fairness problem using a greedy algorithm. An achievable rate
is derived under the truncated Gaussian input distribution. To reduce the
decoding complexity, a map on the decoding order and rate allocation is
constructed for all positions of interest on the receiver plane and its size is
reduced by a classification-based algorithm. Meanwhile, the symmetrical
geometry of LED arrays is exploited. Finally, the transmitter-user association
problem is formulated and solved by a genetic algorithm. It is observed that
the system throughput increases as the receivers are slightly misaligned with
corresponding LED arrays due to the reduced interference level, but decreases
afterwards due to the weakened link gain.

statistics: how to determine which of several datasets is the best for
inferring neuronal responses. Comparisons of this kind are important for
experimenters when choosing an imaging protocol - and for developers of new
acquisition methods. However, the hypothesis that one dataset is better than
another cannot be tested using conventional statistics (based on likelihood
ratios), as these require the data to be the same under each hypothesis. Here
we present Bayesian data comparison, a principled framework for evaluating the
quality of functional imaging data, in terms of the precision with which
neuronal connectivity parameters can be estimated and competing models can be
disambiguated. For each of several candidate datasets, neuronal responses are
inferred using Dynamic Casual Modelling (DCM) - a commonly used Bayesian
procedure for modelling neuroimaging data. Next, the parameters from
subject-specific models are summarised at the group level using a Bayesian
General Linear Model (GLM). A series of measures, which we introduce here, are
then used to evaluate each dataset in terms of the precision of (group-level)
parameter estimates and the ability of the data to distinguish similar models.
To exemplify the approach, we compared four datasets that were acquired in a
study evaluating multiband fMRI acquisition schemes. To enable people to
reproduce these analyses using their own data and experimental paradigms, we
provide general-purpose Matlab code via the SPM software.

uncertainty relation for general time-independent Hamiltonians, stated for both

strong, in the sense that it allows for a quantum memory to help reduce the

relative entropy of asymmetry. Due to the operational relevance of entropy, we
anticipate that our uncertainty relation will have information-processing

detects moving objects and uses the relevant information for action selection.
The detection of moving objects is done in an unsupervised way by exploiting
structure from motion. Instead of directly learning a policy from raw images,
the agent first learns to detect and segment moving objects by exploiting flow
information in video sequences. The learned representation is then used to
focus the policy of the agent on the moving objects. Over time, the agent
identifies which objects are critical for decision making and gradually builds
a policy based on relevant moving objects. This approach, which we call
Motion-Oriented REinforcement Learning (MOREL), is demonstrated on a suite of
Atari games where the ability to detect moving objects reduces the amount of
interaction needed with the environment to obtain a good policy. Furthermore,
the resulting policy is more interpretable than policies that directly map
images to actions or values with a black box neural network. We can gain
insight into the policy by inspecting the segmentation and motion of each
object detected by the agent. This allows practitioners to confirm whether a
policy is making decisions based on sensible information.

  A theorem of R\""odl asserts that if an $n$-vertex graph is non-universal then
it contains an almost homogeneous set (i.e one with edge density either very

adaptation problem. We present new normalized solutions with strong theoretical
guarantees for the cross-entropy loss and other similar losses. We also provide
new guarantees that hold in the case where the conditional probabilities for
the source domains are distinct. Moreover, we give new algorithms for
determining the distribution-weighted combination solution for the
cross-entropy loss and other losses. We report the results of a series of
experiments with real-world datasets. We find that our algorithm outperforms
competing approaches by producing a single robust model that performs well on
any target mixture distribution. Altogether, our theory, algorithms, and
empirical results provide a full solution for the multiple-source adaptation
problem with very practical benefits.

4-manifolds satisfying a generic condition, that are compatible with other
geometric structures. A \em{Lagrangian} Engel structure is an Engel 2-plane
field on a symplectic 4-manifold for which the 2-planes are Lagrangian with
respect to the symplectic structure. We solve the equivalence problems for
Lagrangian Engel structures and use the resulting structure equations to
classify homogeneous Lagrangian Engel structures. This allows us to determine
all compact, homogeneous examples. Compact manifolds that support homogeneous
Lagrangian Engel structures are diffeomorphic to quotients of one of a
determined list of nilpotent or solvable 4-dimensional Lie groups by co-compact
lattices.

  Video Streaming","Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-access edge computing (MEC) enables placing video content at the edge
of the network aiming to improve the quality of experience (QoE) of the mobile
clients. Video content caching at edge servers also reduces traffic in the
backhaul of the mobile network, hence reducing operational costs for mobile
network operators (MNOs). However, minimizing the rate of cache misses and
maximizing the average video quality may sometimes be at odds with each other,
particularly when the cache size is constrained. Our objective in this article
is two fold: First, we explore the impact of fixed video content caching on the
optimal QoE of mobile clients in a setup where servers at mobile network edge
handle bitrate selection. Second, we want to investigate the effect of cache
replacement on QoE-traffic trade-off. An integer nonlinear programming (INLP)
optimization model is formulated for the problem of jointly maximizing the QoE,
the fairness as well as minimizing overall data traffic on the origin video
server. Due to its NP-Hardness, we then present a low complexity greedy-based
algorithm with minimum need for parameter tuning which can be easily deployed.
We show through simulations that the joint optimization indeed enables striking
a desired trade-off between traffic reduction and QoE. The results also reveal
that with fixed cached contents, the impact of caching on the QoE is
proportional to the desired operational point of MNO. Furthermore, the effect
of cache replacement on QoE is less noticeable compared to its effect on
backhaul traffic when cache size is constrained.

dialogue context, is an essential part of task-oriented dialogue systems. In
this paper, we propose the Global-Locally Self-Attentive Dialogue State Tracker
(GLAD), which learns representations of the user utterance and previous system
actions with global-local modules. Our model uses global modules to share
parameters between estimators for different types (called slots) of dialogue
states, and uses local modules to learn slot-specific features. We show that
this significantly improves tracking of rare states and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the WoZ and DSTC2 state tracking tasks. GLAD
obtains 88.1% joint goal accuracy and 97.1% request accuracy on WoZ,
outperforming prior work by 3.7% and 5.5%. On DSTC2, our model obtains 74.5%

1.1% and 1.0%.

require substantial generalisation skills, recent studies have implied that
they struggle when solving the task they are trained on requires inferring its
underlying compositional structure. In this paper, we introduce Attentive
Guidance, a mechanism to direct a sequence to sequence model equipped with
attention to find more compositional solutions. We test it on two tasks,
devised precisely to assess the compositional capabilities of neural models,
and we show that vanilla sequence to sequence models with attention overfit the
training distribution, while the guided versions come up with compositional
solutions that fit the training and testing distributions almost equally well.
Moreover, the learned solutions generalise even in cases where the training and
testing distributions strongly diverge. In this way, we demonstrate that
sequence to sequence models are capable of finding compositional solutions
without requiring extra components. These results helps to disentangle the
causes for the lack of systematic compositionality in neural networks, which
can in turn fuel future work.

suitable for modeling dynamic systems. To train an RNN for multi-step
prediction of dynamic systems, it is crucial to efficiently address the state
initialization problem, which seeks proper values for the RNN initial states at
the beginning of each prediction interval. In this work, the state
initialization problem is addressed using Neural Networks (NNs) to effectively
train a variety of RNNs for modeling two aerial vehicles, a helicopter and a
quadrotor, from experimental data. It is shown that the RNN initialized by the
NN-based initialization method outperforms the state of the art. Further, a
comprehensive study of RNNs trained for multi-step prediction of the two aerial
vehicles is presented. The multi-step prediction of the quadrotor is enhanced
using a hybrid model which combines a simplified physics-based motion model of
the vehicle with RNNs. While the maximum translational and rotational
velocities in the quadrotor dataset are about 4 m/s and 3.8 rad/s,
respectively, the hybrid model produces predictions, over 1.9 second, which
remain within 9 cm/s and 0.12 rad/s of the measured translational and
rotational velocities, with 99\% confidence on the test dataset
