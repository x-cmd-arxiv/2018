200$ TeV) neutrino from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056 and the
coincident observations of enhanced $\gamma$-ray emissions from the same object
by MAGIC and other experiments can be used to set stringent constraints on
Lorentz violation in the propagation of neutrinos that is linear in the
neutrino energy: $\Delta v = - E/M_1$, where $\Delta v$ is the deviation from
the velocity of light, and $M_1$ is an unknown high energy scale to be
constrained by experiment. Allowing for a difference in neutrino and photon
propagation times of $\sim 10$ days, we find that $M_1 \gtrsim 3 \times
10^{16}$ GeV. This improves on previous limits on linear Lorentz violation in
neutrino propagation by many orders of magnitude, and the same is true for
quadratic Lorentz violation.

partition of $\mathbb{N}$ can be represented as a paintbox based on a random
mass-partition. Similarly, any exchangeable composition (i.e. ordered partition
of $\mathbb{N}$) can be represented as a paintbox based on an
interval-partition (Gnedin 1997). Our first main result is that any
exchangeable coalescent process (not necessarily Markovian) can be represented
as a paintbox based on a random non-decreasing process valued in
interval-partitions, called nested interval-partition, generalizing the notion
of comb metric space introduced by Lambert & Uribe Bravo (2017) to represent
compact ultrametric spaces. As a special case, we show that any
$\Lambda$-coalescent can be obtained from a paintbox based on a unique random
nested interval partition called $\Lambda$-comb, which is Markovian with
explicit transitions. This nested interval-partition directly relates to the
flow of bridges of Bertoin & Le Gall (2003). We also display a particularly
simple description of the so-called evolving coalescent (Pfaffelhuber &
Wakolbinger 2006) by a comb-valued Markov process. Next, we prove that any
measured ultrametric space $U$, under mild measure-theoretic assumptions on
$U$, is the leaf set of a tree composed of a separable subtree called the
backbone, on which are grafted additional subtrees, which act as star-trees
from the standpoint of sampling. Displaying this so-called weak isometry
requires us to extend the Gromov-weak topology of Greven et al (2006), that was
initially designed for separable metric spaces, to non-separable ultrametric
spaces. It allows us to show that for any such ultrametric space $U$, there is
a nested interval-partition which is 1) indistinguishable from $U$ in the
Gromov-weak topology; 2) weakly isometric to $U$ if $U$ has complete backbone;
3) isometric to $U$ if $U$ is complete and separable.

We call such groups densely (locally) minimal. In 1972 Prodanov proved that the
infinite compact abelian groups having all subgroups minimal are precisely the
groups $\mathbb Z_p$ of $p$-adic integers. In [31], we extended Prodanov's
theorem to the non-abelian case at several levels. In this paper, we focus on
the densely (locally) minimal abelian groups.
  We prove that in case that a topological abelian group $G$ is either compact
or connected locally compact, then $G$ is densely locally minimal if and only
if $G$ either is a Lie group or has an open subgroup isomorphic to $\mathbb
Z_p$ for some prime $p$. This should be compared with the main result of [9].
Our Theorem C provides another extension of Prodanov's theorem: an infinite
locally compact group is densely minimal if and only if it is isomorphic to
$\mathbb Z_p$. In contrast, we show that there exists a densely minimal,
compact, two-step nilpotent group that neither is a Lie group nor it has an

hierarchy. We present a new method to determine neutrino mass hierarchy by
comparing the events of inverse beta decays (IBD), $\bar{\nu}_e + p\rightarrow
n + e^+$, and neutral current (NC) interactions, $\nu(\overline{\nu}) +
p\rightarrow\nu(\overline{\nu}) + p$, of supernova neutrinos from accretion and
cooling phases in scintillation detectors. Supernova neutrino flavor
conversions depend on the neutrino mass hierarchy. On account of
Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effects, the full swap of $\bar{\nu}_e$ flux with
the $\bar{\nu}_x$ ($x=\mu,~\tau$) one occurs in the inverted hierarchy, while
such a swap does not occur in the normal hierarchy. In consequence, the ratio
of high energy IBD events to NC events for the inverted hierarchy is higher
than in the normal hierarchy. Since the luminosity of $\bar{\nu}_e$ is larger
than that of $\nu_x$ in accretion phase while the luminosity of $\bar{\nu}_e$
becomes smaller than that of $\nu_x$ in cooling phase, we calculate this ratio
for both accretion and cooling phases. By analyzing the change of this event
ratio from accretion phase to cooling phase, one can determine the neutrino
mass hierarchy.

gravitational shock waves on the dual geometries. Regardless of the nature of
the transition, for values of the parameter close to the critical value almost
all the energy of the projectiles is deposited into a long-lived, quasi-static
blob of energy at mid-rapidity. This configuration is well described by the
constitutive relations of second-order hydrodynamics that include all
second-order gradients that are purely spatial in the local rest frame. In
contrast, a M\""uller-Israel-Stewart-type formulation of hydrodynamics fails to
provide a good description. We discuss possible implications for searches of
the QCD critical point.

the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model and observations. The 'missing
satellites problem' infamously describes the overabundance of subhalos from CDM
simulations compared to the number of satellites observed in the Milky Way. A
variety of solutions to this discrepancy have been proposed; however, the
impact of the specific properties of the Milky Way halo relative to the typical
halo of its mass have yet to be explored. Motivated by recent studies that
identified ways in which the Milky Way is atypical (e.g., Licquia et al. 2015),
we investigate how the properties of dark matter halos with mass comparable to
our Galaxy's --- including concentration, spin, shape, and scale factor of the
last major merger --- correlate with the subhalo abundance. Using zoom-in
simulations of Milky Way-like halos, we build two models of subhalo abundance
as functions of host halo properties and conclude that the Milky Way should be
expected to have 22%-44% fewer subhalos with low maximum rotation velocities
($V_{\rm max}^{\rm sat} \sim 10$kms$^{-1}$) at the 95% confidence level and up
to 72% fewer than average subhalos with high rotation velocities ($V_{\rm
max}^{\rm sat} \gtrsim 30$kms$^{-1}$, comparable to the Magellanic Clouds) than
would be expected for a typical halo of the Milky Way's mass. Concentration is
the most informative single parameter for predicting subhalo abundance. Our
results imply that models tuned to explain the missing satellites problem
assuming typical subhalo abundances for our Galaxy will be over-correcting.

can be viewed as a (hierarchically large) bound on the smallness of the slow
roll parameter $\epsilon_V$. This leads us to consider the other slow roll
parameter $\eta_V$ more closely, and we are lead to conjecture that the bound
is not necessarily on $\epsilon_V$, but on slow roll itself. A natural
refinement of the de Sitter swampland conjecture is therefore that slow roll is
violated at ${\cal O}(1)$ in Planck units in any UV complete theory. A
corollary is that $\epsilon_V$ need not necessarily be ${\cal O}(1)$, if
$\eta_V \lesssim -{\cal O}(1)$ holds. We consider various tachyonic tree level

goal is to find an assignment satisfying a relaxed version of the constraints.
Several well-known problems can be cast as promise CSPs including approximate
graph coloring, discrepancy minimization, and interesting variants of
satisfiability. Similar to CSPs, the tractability of promise CSPs can be tied
to the structure of operations on the solution space called polymorphisms,
though in the promise world these operations are much less constrained. Under
the thesis that non-trivial polymorphisms govern tractability, promise CSPs
therefore provide a fertile ground for the discovery of novel algorithms.
  In previous work, we classified Boolean promise CSPs when the constraint
predicates are symmetric. In this work, we vastly generalize these algorithmic
results. Specifically, we show that promise CSPs that admit a family of
""regional-periodic"" polymorphisms are in P, assuming that determining which
region a point is in can be computed in polynomial time. Such polymorphisms are
quite general and are obtained by gluing together several functions that are
periodic in the Hamming weights in different blocks of the input.
  Our algorithm is based on a novel combination of linear programming and
solving linear systems over rings. We also abstract a framework based on
reducing a promise CSP to a CSP over an infinite domain, solving it there, and
then rounding the solution to an assignment for the promise CSP instance. The
rounding step is intimately tied to the family of polymorphisms and clarifies
the connection between polymorphisms and algorithms in this context. As a key
ingredient, we introduce the technique of finding a solution to a linear
program with integer coefficients that lies in a different ring (such as
$\mathbb Z[\sqrt{2}]$) to bypass ad-hoc adjustments for lying on a rounding
boundary.

we perform a similar study in a more complicated case: the XXZ open spin-1/2
chain with the most general integrable boundary terms. To solve this model by
means of SoV we use an algebraic Vertex-IRF gauge transformation reducing one
of the boundary K-matrices to a diagonal form. As usual within the SoV
approach, the scalar products of separate states are computed in terms of
dressed Vandermonde determinants having an intricate dependency on the
inhomogeneity parameters. We show that these determinants can be transformed
into different ones in which the homogeneous limit can be taken
straightforwardly. These representations generalize in a non-trivial manner to
the trigonometric case the expressions found previously in the rational case.
We also show that generically all scalar products can be expressed in a form
which is similar to - although more cumbersome than - the well-known Slavnov
determinant representation for the scalar products of the Bethe states of the
periodic chain. Considering a special choice of the boundary parameters
relevant in the thermodynamic limit to describe the half infinite chain with a
general boundary, we particularize these representations to the case of one of

applications where -- much like in computer vision -- the challenges are
characterized by high-dimensional spatial data dominated by multipoint
statistics. In particular, a novel technique called generative adversarial
networks has been recently studied for geological parametrization and
synthesis, obtaining very impressive results that are at least qualitatively
competitive with previous methods. The method obtains a neural network
parametrization of the geology -- so-called a generator -- that is capable of
reproducing very complex geological patterns with dimensionality reduction of
several orders of magnitude. Subsequent works have addressed the conditioning
task, i.e. using the generator to generate realizations honoring spatial
observations (hard data). The current approaches, however, do not provide a
parametrization of the conditional generation process. In this work, we propose
a method to obtain a parametrization for direct generation of conditional
realizations. The main idea is to simply extend the existing generator network
by stacking a second inference network that learns to perform the conditioning.
This inference network is a neural network trained to sample a posterior
distribution derived using a Bayesian formulation of the conditioning task. The
resulting extended neural network thus provides the conditional
parametrization. Our method is assessed on a benchmark image of binary
channelized subsurface, obtaining very promising results for a wide variety of
conditioning configurations.

electromagnetic (EM) counterparts GRB170817A and kilonova AT 2017gfo has
triggered extensive study of the EM emission of binary neutron star mergers. A
parameter which is common to and plays a key role in both the GW and the EM
analyses is the viewing angle of the binary's orbit. If a binary is viewed from
different angles, the amount of GW energy changes (implying that orientation
and distance are correlated) and the EM signatures can vary, depending on the
structure of the emission. Information about the viewing angle of the binary
orbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the
EM data, and can potentially be extracted from either side.
  In the first part of this study, we present a systematic analysis of how well
the viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data. We
show that if the sky position and the redshift of the binary can be identified
via the EM counterpart and an associated host galaxy, then for 50$\%$ of the
systems the viewing angle can be constrained to $\leq 7^{\circ}$ uncertainty
from the GW data, independent of electromagnetic emission models. On the other
hand, if no redshift measurement is available, the measurement of the viewing
angle with GW alone is not informative, unless the true viewing angle is close
to $90^{\circ}$. This holds true even if the sky position is measured
independently.
  Then, we consider the case where some constraints on the viewing angle can be
placed from the EM data itself. We show that the EM measurements can then be
used in the analysis of GW data to improve the precision of the luminosity
distance, and hence of the Hubble constant, by a factor of 2 to 3.

vacuum states and (ii) the appropriate measure in the quantum path integral. To
address (i) we explicitly construct the set of ground state wave-functionals in
the field basis focussing on scalar modes $\theta(x)$. Firstly, we show that in
the limit in which the gauge coupling is zero, we obtain an infinite set of
degenerate ground states at large volume distinguished by
$\theta(x)\to\theta(x)+\theta_0$, spontaneously breaking the global symmetry,
as is well known. We then show that at finite gauge coupling there is a unique
ground state at large volume since the wave-functional only depends on
$\nabla\theta$ in the IR, and we explain this at the level of the Lagrangian.
Since gauge fields fall off exponentially from sources there are no conserved
charges or symmetries in the Higgs phase; so the Higgs mechanism is the removal
of symmetry from the theory. We show how physical features of defects, such as
cosmic strings in the abelian Higgs model, are best understood in this context.
Since there is a unique ground state, we address (ii) whether the path integral
is a volume measure for the radial Higgs field $\mathcal{D}\rho\,\rho^{N-1}$
from the $N$ components of the Higgs multiplet, or a line measure
$\mathcal{D}\rho$ as the $N-1$ would-be Goldstones can be removed in unitary
gauge. We prove that the need to avoid quartic divergences demands a tower of
counter terms that resum to exactly give the volume measure. So the size of the
Hilbert space in the zero gauge coupling case and finite gauge coupling case
are in one-to-one correspondence, despite the degeneracy of the ground state
being lifted in the latter. As a cosmological application, we point out that
the volume measure can make it exponentially more unlikely in $N(=4)$ for the
Standard Model Higgs to relax to the electroweak vacuum in the early universe.

always result in a non-singular inflationary scenario with a phase of
super-inflation succeeded by the conventional inflation. We show the existence

are only reliable over approximately sub-Planckian field excursions. The two
most promising effective models for early universe cosmology, inflation and
ekpyrosis, are mechanisms that, in order to address cosmological puzzles, must
operate over vast expansion/energy ranges. This suggests that it might be
appropriate to describe them using scaling laws. Here we combine these two
ideas and demonstrate that they drive inflation and ekpyrosis to their
extremes: inflation must start at ultra-slow-roll, and ekpyrosis at
ultra-fast-roll. At face value, the implied spectra are overly tilted to the
red, although in both cases minor departures from pure scale freedom bring the
spectral indices within current observational bounds. These models predict a
significant spectral running at a level detectable in the near future
($\alpha_s \approx -10^{-3}$). Ekpyrotic models with minimal coupling are
nevertheless ruled out, as they lead to levels of non-Gaussianity that are at
least an order of magnitude too large. No such restrictions apply to models
with a kinetic coupling between the two ekpyrotic scalar fields, and these
remain the most promising ekpyrotic models.
  An additional swampland criterion that was recently proposed for the slope of
the scalar field potential would however rule out all ultra-slow-roll models of
inflation. Finally, we speculate on the existence of corresponding restrictions
on the slope at negative potential values, which might lead to similarly severe
constraints on ekpyrotic models.

v}$ to a non-negative value $I({\bf v})$ so that the more homogeneous ${\bf
v}$, the larger its impurity. We study clustering based on impurity measures:
given a collection $V$ of $n$ many $k$-dimensional vectors and an impurity
measure $I$, the goal is to find a partition ${\cal P}$ of $V$ into $L$ groups
$V_1,\ldots,V_L$ that minimizes the total impurities of the groups in ${\cal
P}$, i.e., $I({\cal P})= \sum_{m=1}^{L} I(\sum_{{\bf v} \in V_m}{\bf v}).$
  Impurity minimization is widely used as quality assessment measure in
probability distribution clustering and in categorical clustering where it is
not possible to rely on geometric properties of the data set. However, in
contrast to the case of metric based clustering, the current knowledge of
impurity measure based clustering in terms of approximation and
inapproximability results is very limited.
  Our research contributes to fill this gap. We first present a simple linear
time algorithm that simultaneously achieves $3$-approximation for the Gini
impurity measure and $O(\log(\sum_{{\bf v} \in V} \| {\bf v}
\|_1))$-approximation for the Entropy impurity measure. Then, for the Entropy
impurity measure---where we also show that finding the optimal clustering is
strongly NP-hard---we are able to design a polynomial time
$O(\log^2(\min\{k,L\}))$-approximation algorithm. Our algorithm relies on a
nontrivial characterization of a class of clusterings that necessarily includes
a partition achieving $O(\log^2(\min\{k,L\}))$--approximation of the impurity
of the optimal partition. Remarkably, this is the first polynomial time
algorithm with approximation guarantee independent of the number of
points/vector and not relying on any restriction on the components of the
vectors for producing clusterings with minimum entropy.

network element learns a chart of the radio geometry in its surrounding area.
The channel chart captures the local spatial geometry of the area so that
points that are close in space will also be close in the channel chart and vice
versa. CC works in a fully unsupervised manner, i.e., learning is only based on
channel state information (CSI) that is passively collected at a single point
in space, but from multiple transmit locations in the area over time. The
method then extracts channel features that characterize large-scale fading
properties of the wireless channel. Finally, the channel charts are generated
with tools from dimensionality reduction, manifold learning, and deep neural
networks. The network element performing CC may be, for example, a
multi-antenna base-station in a cellular system and the charted area in the
served cell. Logical relationships related to the position and movement of a
transmitter, e.g., a user equipment (UE), in the cell can then be directly
deduced from comparing measured radio channel characteristics to the channel
chart. The unsupervised nature of CC enables a range of new applications in UE

eye-tracking experiments, in which humans perform an iris recognition task,
give better performance than random patches? Our results say that (1)
domain-specific BSIF features can out-perform the default BSIF features, and
(2) selecting image patches in a task-specific manner guided by human

neutrons, the fundamental building blocks of nuclei collectively known as
nucleons. The field of nucleon spin provides a critical window for testing
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the gauge theory of the strong interactions since
it involves fundamental aspects of hadron structure, and it can be probed in
detail in experiments, particularly deep inelastic lepton scattering on
polarized targets. QCD was initially probed in high energy deep inelastic
lepton scattering with unpolarized beams and targets. With time, interest
shifted from testing perturbative QCD to illuminating the nucleon structure
itself. In fact, the spin degrees of freedom of hadrons provide an essential
and detailed verification of both perturbative and nonperturbative QCD
dynamics. Nucleon spin was initially thought of coming mostly from the spin of
its quark constituents, based on intuition from the parton model. However, the
first experiments showed that this expectation was incorrect. It is now clear
that nucleon physics is much more complex, involving quark orbital angular
momenta as well as gluonic and sea quark contributions. Thus, the nucleon spin
structure remains a most active aspect of QCD research, involving important
advances such as the developments of generalized parton distributions (GPD) and
transverse momentum distributions (TMD). Elastic and inelastic lepton-proton
scattering, as well as photoabsorption experiments provide various ways to
investigate non-perturbative QCD. Fundamental sum rules -- such as the Bjorken
sum rule for polarized photoabsorption on polarized nucleons -- are also in the
non-perturbative domain. This realization triggered a vigorous program to link
the low energy effective hadronic description of the strong interactions to

problem of portfolio weight selection to maximize expected logarithmic growth.
Going beyond existing literature, our focal point here is the rebalancing
frequency which we include as an additional parameter in our analysis. The
problem is first set in a control-theoretic framework, and then, the main
question we address is as follows: In the absence of transaction costs, does
high-frequency trading always lead to the best performance? Related to this is
our prior work on betting, also in the Kelly context, which examines the impact
of making a wager and letting it ride. Our results on betting frequency can be
interpreted in the context of weight selection for a two-asset portfolio
consisting of one risky asset and one riskless asset. With regard to the
question above, our prior results indicate that it is often the case that there
are no performance benefits associated with high-frequency trading. In the
present paper, we generalize the analysis to portfolios with multiple risky
assets. We show that if there is an asset satisfying a new condition which we
call dominance, then an optimal portfolio consists of this asset alone; i.e.,
the trader has ""all eggs in one basket"" and performance becomes a constant
function of rebalancing frequency. Said another way, the problem of rebalancing
is rendered moot. The paper also includes simulations which address practical
considerations associated with real stock prices and the dominant asset
condition.

effectiveness which depends on the supply of visible photons with wavelengths
between 400 and 700 nm. In this paper, we quantify the effectiveness of PS in
two contexts which are relevant for M dwarfs. First, using photons from an M
dwarf in its quiescent non-flaring state, we find that PS on an M dwarf planet
in the HZ of its parent star is less effective than on Earth by a factor of 10
for a flare star with mid-M spectral type. For a flare star with late-M
spectral type, PS effectiveness is smaller than on Earth by a factor of 100 or
more. Second, using photons which are incident on the HZ planet during flares,
we find that PS effectiveness can increase by factors of 5-20 above the
quiescent values. In the case of a flare star with mid-M spectral type, we find
that the PS effectiveness during a flare can increase up to as much as 50-60
percent of the values on Earth. However, for a late-M flare star, even during
flares, the PS effectiveness remains almost one order of magnitude smaller than
on Earth. We suggest that for biological processes on M dwarf planets, the
stellar activity cycle may replace the orbital period as the year.

number of standard deviations beyond which one should clip data from a sample
ultimately depends on the size of the sample. Chauvenet rejection is one of the
oldest, and simplest, ways to account for this, but, like sigma clipping,
depends on the sample's mean and standard deviation, neither of which are
robust quantities: Both are easily contaminated by the very outliers they are
being used to reject. Many, more robust measures of central tendency, and of
sample deviation, exist, but each has a tradeoff with precision. Here, we
demonstrate that outlier rejection can be both very robust and very precise if
decreasingly robust but increasingly precise techniques are applied in
sequence. To this end, we present a variation on Chauvenet rejection that we
call ""robust"" Chauvenet rejection (RCR), which uses three decreasingly
robust/increasingly precise measures of central tendency, and four decreasingly
robust/increasingly precise measures of sample deviation. We show this
sequential approach to be very effective for a wide variety of contaminant
types, even when a significant -- even dominant -- fraction of the sample is
contaminated, and especially when the contaminants are strong. Furthermore, we

central star masses in excess of $0.66 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$, and main sequence
progenitors of at least $\sim 2.5 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$. Since M31's bulge has
very few intermediate-age stars, we conclude that conventional single-star

present the circumstellar extinctions for the region's bright PNe and
demonstrate that the distribution is similar to that found for PNe in the Large

our results to extinction measurements made for PNe in the E6 elliptical NGC

standard model lepton flavor so that the correct relic density is obtained. We
identify a discrete symmetry that allows mass mixing between the vector-like

between these fields and the remaining standard model leptons. This flavor
sequestering avoids unwanted lepton-flavor-violating effects, substantially
relaxing constraints on the mass scale of the vector-like states. We discuss

$\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control and iterative learning control (ILC) framework

changing disturbances. The $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive controller makes the system
behave close to a reference model; however, it does not guarantee that perfect

performance based on previous iterations. The combined framework in this paper
uses $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control as an underlying controller that achieves
a robust and repeatable behavior, while the ILC acts as a high-level adaptation
scheme that mainly compensates for systematic tracking errors. We illustrate
that this framework enables transfer learning between dynamically different
systems, where learned experience of one system can be shown to be beneficial
for another different system. Experimental results with two different
quadrotors show the superior performance of the combined $\mathcal{L}_1$-ILC

art models in machine learning. Most successful deep neural models are the ones
with many layers which highly increases their number of parameters. Training
such models requires a large number of training samples which is not always
available. One of the fundamental issues in neural networks is overfitting
which is the issue tackled in this thesis. Such problem often occurs when the
training of large models is performed using few training samples. Many
approaches have been proposed to prevent the network from overfitting and
improve its generalization performance such as data augmentation, early
stopping, parameters sharing, unsupervised learning, dropout, batch
normalization, etc.
  In this thesis, we tackle the neural network overfitting issue from a
representation learning perspective by considering the situation where few
training samples are available which is the case of many real world
applications. We propose three contributions. The first one presented in
chapter 2 is dedicated to dealing with structured output problems to perform
multivariate regression when the output variable y contains structural
dependencies between its components. The second contribution described in
chapter 3 deals with the classification task where we propose to exploit prior
knowledge about the internal representation of the hidden layers in neural
networks. Our last contribution presented in chapter 4 showed the interest of
transfer learning in applications where only few samples are available. In this
contribution, we provide an automatic system based on such learning scheme with
an application to medical domain. In this application, the task consists in
localizing the third lumbar vertebra in a 3D CT scan. This work has been done

mechanism, focusing on agents with Leontief utilities. The majority of the
economics and mechanism design literature has focused on \emph{linear} prices,
meaning that the cost of a good is proportional to the quantity purchased.
Equilibria for linear prices are known to be exactly the maximum Nash welfare
allocations.
  \emph{Price curves} allow the cost of a good to be any (increasing) function
of the quantity purchased. We show that price curve equilibria are not limited
to maximum Nash welfare allocations with two main results. First, we show that
an allocation can be supported by strictly increasing price curves if and only
if it is \emph{group-domination-free}. A similarly characterization holds for
weakly increasing price curves. We use this to show that given any allocation,
we can compute strictly (or weakly) increasing price curves that support it (or
show that none exist) in polynomial time. These results involve a connection to
the \emph{agent-order matrix} of an allocation, which may have other
applications. Second, we use duality to show that in the bandwidth allocation
setting, any allocation maximizing a CES welfare function can be supported by
price curves.

point to supersymmetry as an underlying symmetry of particle physics: the
unification of gauge couplings within supersymmetry, the fact that nature
respects the supersymmetry prediction that the Higgs boson mass lie below 130
GeV, and vacuum stability up to the Planck scale with a Higgs boson mass at
$\sim 125$ GeV while the standard model does not do that. Coupled with the fact
that supersymmetry solves the big hierarchy problem related to the quadratic
divergence to the Higgs boson mass square along with the fact that there is no
alternative paradigm that allows us to extrapolate physics from the electroweak
scale to the grand unification scale consistent with experiment, supersymmetry
remains a compelling framework for new physics beyond the standard model. The
large loop correction to the Higgs boson mass in supersymmetry to lift the tree
mass to the experimentally observable value, indicates a larger value of the
scale of weak scale supersymmetry, making the observation of sparticles more
challenging but still within reach at the LHC for the lightest ones. Recent
analyses show that a high energy LHC (HE-LHC) operating at 27 TeV running at
its optimal luminosity of $2.5 \times 10^{35}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ can reduce the
discovery period by several years relative to HL-LHC and significantly extend
the reach in parameter space of models. In the coming years several experiments
related to neutrino physics, searches for supersymmetry, on dark matter and

element mass ($M_Z$) in these planets. The corresponding relation is
characterized by a power-law profile, $M_Z \propto M_p^{3/5}$. We develop a
simplified, but physically motivated analysis to investigate how the power-law
profile can be produced under the current picture of planet formation. Making
use of the existing semi-analytical formulae of accretion rates of pebbles and
planetesimals, our analysis shows that the relation can be reproduced well if
it traces the final stage of planet formation. In the stage, planets accrete
solids from gapped planetesimal disks and gas accretion is limited by disk
evolution. We also find that dust accretion accompanying with gas accretion
does not contribute to $M_Z$ for planets with $M_p < 10^3 M_{\oplus}$. Our
findings are broadly consistent with that of previous studies, yet we
explicitly demonstrate how planetesimal dynamics is crucial for better
understanding the relation. While our approach is simple, we can also reproduce
the trend of a correlation between planet metallicity and $M_p$ that is
obtained by detailed population synthesis calculations, when the same
assumption is adopted. Our analysis suggests that pebble accretion would not
play a direct role at the final stage of planet formation, whereas radial drift
of pebbles might be important indirectly for metal enrichment of planets.
Detailed numerical simulations and more observational data are required for
confirming our analysis.

Reionization must contend with overwhelmingly bright emission from foreground
sources. Accurate recovery of the 21 cm signal will require precise calibration
of the array, and several new avenues for calibration have been pursued in
recent years, including methods using redundancy in the antenna configuration.
The newly upgraded Phase II of Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is the first
interferometer that has large numbers of redundant baselines while retaining
good instantaneous UV-coverage. This array therefore provides a unique
opportunity to compare redundant calibration with sky-model based algorithms.
In this paper, we present the first results from comparing both calibration
approaches with MWA Phase II observations. For redundant calibration, we use
the package OMNICAL, and produce sky-based calibration solutions with the
analysis package Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD). There are three
principal results. (1) We report the success of OMNICAL on observations of
ORBComm satellites, showing substantial agreement between redundant visibility
measurements after calibration. (2) We directly compare OMNICAL calibration
solutions with those from FHD, and demonstrate these two different calibration
schemes give extremely similar results. (3) We explore improved calibration by
combining OMNICAL and FHD. We evaluate these combined methods using power
spectrum techniques developed for EoR analysis and find evidence for marginal
improvements mitigating artifacts in the power spectrum. These results are
likely limited by signal-to-noise in the six hours of data used, but suggest
future directions for combining these two calibration schemes.

with a stellar mass of about $3\times10^9\; M_{\odot}$. Based on abundance
matching techniques, M33's total mass at infall is estimated to be of order
$10^{11}\; M_{\odot}$. $\Lambda$CDM simulations predict that M33-mass halos
host several of their own low mass satellite companions, yet only one candidate
M33 satellite has been detected in deep photometric surveys to date. This
`satellites of satellites' hierarchy has recently been explored in the context
of the dwarf galaxies discovered around the Milky Way's Magellanic Clouds in
the Dark Energy Survey. Here we discuss the number of satellite galaxies
predicted to reside within the virial radius ($\sim$160 kpc) of M33 based on
$\Lambda$CDM simulations. We also calculate the expected number of satellite
detections in N fields of data using various ground--based imagers. Finally, we
discuss how these satellite population predictions change as a function of
M33's past orbital history. If M33 is on its first infall into M31's halo, its
proposed satellites are expected to remain bound to M33 today. However, if M33
experienced a recent tidal interaction with M31, the number of surviving
satellites depends strongly on the distance achieved at pericenter due to the
effects of tidal stripping. We conclude that a survey extending to $\sim$100
kpc around M33 would be sufficient to constrain its orbital history and a
majority of its satellite population. In the era of WFIRST, surveys of this
size will be considered small observing programs.

to renormalize the bare parameters of the problem, a systematic method was

full incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the evolution equation

out for a wide range of Reynolds numbers, Bingham numbers and ratios of the
fluid and total viscosity, while the turbulent flow simulations are performed
at a fixed bulk Reynolds number equal to 2800 and weak elasticity. We show that
in the laminar flow regime the friction factor increases monotonically with the
Bingham number (yield stress) and decreases with the viscosity ratio, while in
the turbulent regime the the friction factor is almost independent of the
viscosity ratio and decreases with the Bingham number, until the flow
eventually returns to a fully laminar condition for large enough yield
stresses. Three main regimes are found in the turbulent case, depending on the
Bingham number: for low values, the friction Reynolds number and the turbulent
flow statistics only slightly differ from those of a Newtonian fluid; for
intermediate values of the Bingham number, the fluctuations increase and the
inertial equilibrium range is lost. Finally, for higher values the flow
completely laminarises. These different behaviors are associated with a
progressive increases of the volume where the fluid is not yielded, growing
from the centerline towards the walls as the Bingham number increases. The
unyielded region interacts with the near-wall structures, forming
preferentially above the high speed streaks. In particular, the near-wall
streaks and the associated quasi-streamwise vortices are strongly enhanced in

essential in real-time virtual makeup applications, where users can see the

tracking techniques detect diverse facial landmarks and track them using a
point tracker such as the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) point tracker. Typically, 5
or 64 points are used for tracking a face. Even though these points are
sufficient to track the approximate locations of facial landmarks, they are not
sufficient to track the exact shape of facial landmarks. In this paper, we
propose a method that can track the exact shape of facial landmarks in
real-time by combining a deep learning technique and a point tracker. We detect
facial landmarks accurately using SegNet, which performs semantic segmentation
based on deep learning. Edge points of detected landmarks are tracked using the
KLT point tracker. In spite of its popularity, the KLT point tracker suffers
from the point loss problem. We solve this problem by executing SegNet
periodically to calculate the shape of facial landmarks. That is, by combining
the two techniques, we can avoid the computational overhead of SegNet for
real-time shape tracking and the point loss problem of the KLT point tracker.

density (1-1e5 /cm^3), metallicity (0-1e-2 Z_sun), UV strength (0-500 times
Galactic value), and cosmic microwave background temperature (10 and 30 K).
Shock-compressed clouds contract isobarically via atomic and molecular line
cooling, until self-gravitating clumps are formed by fragmentation. If the
metals are only in the gas-phase, the clump mass is higher than ~ 3 M_sun in
any conditions we studied. Although in some cases with a metallicity higher
than ~ 1e-3 Z_sun, re-fragmentation of a clump is caused by metal-line cooling,
this fragment mass is higher than ~ 30 M_sun. On the other hand, if about half
the mass of metals is condensed in dust grains, as in the Galactic interstellar
medium, dust cooling triggers re-fragmentation of a clump into sub-solar mass
pieces, for metallicities higher than ~ 1e-5 Z_sun. Therefore, the presence of
dust is essential in low-mass (< M_sun) star formation from a shock-compressed
cloud.

amount of attention recently for their stability at room temperature and
capability of motion driven by a low-density electrical current, which can be
potentially applied to spintronic devices. However, the thermal effect on the
formation of the skyrmions and their behavior has rarely been studied. Here, we
report a study on the creation of skyrmions in [Pt/Co/Ta]10 multilayer samples
at different temperatures using an in-situ Lorentz transmission electron
microscopy. By imaging the magnetization reversal process from positive
(negative) saturation to negative (positive) saturation, we found that the
skyrmions can be created by nucleation from ferromagnetic saturation state and
by breaking the labyrinth domains under certain external fields. By tuning the
external fields, a maximum density of skyrmions was reached at different
temperatures. The key finding is that the creation of the skyrmions in the
multilayers depends critically on the temperature and thermal history.

an intensity jump in dust continuum at ~ 350 GHz. It is nearly edge-on and is
almost exactly perpendicular to the jet axis. It has a size of ~ 30 au along
the major axis. It is geometrically thick, indicating that the (sub)millimeter
light emitting grains have yet to settle to the midplane. Its inner part is
expected to have transformed into a Keplerian rotating disk with a radius of ~
10 au. A rotating disk atmosphere and a compact rotating bipolar outflow are
detected in SO. The outflow fans out from the inner disk surfaces and is
rotating in the same direction as the flattened envelope, and hence could trace
a disk wind carrying away angular momentum from the inner disk. From the
rotation of the disk atmosphere, the protostellar mass is estimated to be <~ 50
M_Jup. Together with results from the literature, our result favors a model
where the disk radius grows linearly with the protostellar mass, as predicted
by models of pre-stellar dense core evolution that asymptotes to an $r^{-1}$
radial profile for both the column density and angular velocity.

the Modified Frequency Bat Algorithm (MFBA). The path planning problem for the
mobile robot in a dynamic environment is carried out using the proposed MFBA.
The path planning is achieved in two modes; the first mode is called path
generation and is implemented using the MFBA, this mode is enabled when no
obstacles near the mobile robot exist. When an obstacle close to the mobile
robot is detected, the second mode, i.e., the obstacle avoidance (OA) is
initiated. Simulation experiments have been conducted to check the validity and
the efficiency of the suggested MFBA based path planning algorithm by comparing
its performance with that of the standard BA. The simulation results showed
that the MFBA outperforms the standard BA by planning a collision-free path
with shorter, safer, and smoother than the path obtained by its BA counterpart.

equipartition property of the channel's smooth max-information; i.e., it
converges to the quantum mutual information of the channel in the independent
and identically distributed asymptotic limit. This implies the quantum reverse
Shannon theorem in the presence of no-signalling correlations. Finally, we
explore the simulation cost of various quantum channels.

still active after the acceleration phase, the modulated profile possesses a
severely decreased lift-up potential as measured by transient growth. As shown,
this results in an exponential decay of fluctuations and the flow
relaminarises. While this method can be easily applied at low to moderate flow
speeds, the minimum streamwise length over which the acceleration needs to act
increases linearly with the Reynolds number.

cross-section presents singular points, such as abrupt changes of radius or the
presence of thin walls, with openings, delimiting periodic compartments
composing the channel. Dispersion in such systems is analyzed using the
Fick-Jacobs' approximation. This approximation assumes a much faster
equilibration in the lateral than in the axial direction, along which the
dispersion is measured. If the characteristic width $a$ of the channel is much
smaller than the period $L$ of the channel, i.e. $\varepsilon = a/L$ is small,
this assumption is clearly valid for Brownian particles. For discontinuous
channels, the Fick-Jacobs' approximation is only valid at the lowest order in
$\varepsilon$ and provides a rough, though on occasions rather accurate,
estimate of the effective diffusivity. Here we provide formulas for the
effective diffusivity in discontinuous channels that are asymptotically exact
at the next-to-leading order in $\varepsilon$. Each discontinuity leads to a
reduction of the effective diffusivity. We show that our theory is consistent
with the picture of effective {\em trapping rates} associated with each
discontinuity, for which our theory provides explicit and asymptotically exact

scheduling policy determines the number of working servers (servers that are
turned on) in each group at every state $n$ (number of customers in the
system). Our goal is to find the optimal scheduling policy to minimize the
long-run average cost, which consists of an increasing convex holding cost and
a linear operating cost. We use the sensitivity-based optimization theory to
characterize the optimal policy. A necessary and sufficient condition of the
optimal policy is derived. We also prove that the optimal policy has monotone
structures and a quasi bang-bang control is optimal. We find that the optimal
policy is indexed by the value of $c - \mu G(n)$, where $c$ is the operating
cost rate, $\mu$ is the service rate for a server, and $G(n)$ is a computable
quantity called perturbation realization factor. Specifically, the group with
smaller negative $c - \mu G(n)$ is more preferred to be turned on, while the
group with positive $c - \mu G(n)$ should be turned off. However, the
preference ranking of each group is affected by $G(n)$ and the preference order
may change with the state $n$, the arrival rate, and the cost function. Under a
reasonable condition of scale economies, we further prove that the optimal
policy obeys a so-called $c$/$\mu$-rule. That is, the servers with smaller
$c$/$\mu$ should be turned on with higher priority and the preference order of
groups remains unchanged. This rule can be viewed as a sister version of the

sensing vectors are selected while sampling, depending on previous

the signal of interest is sparse. The corresponding transform determines the
collection of sensing vectors. K-AHS gradually refines initial coarse
measurements to significant signal coefficients in the sparse transform domain
based on a sensing tree which provides a natural hierarchy of sensing vectors.
K-AHS directly provides significant signal coefficients in the sparse transform
domain and does not require a reconstruction stage based on inverse
optimization. Therefore, the K-AHS sensing vectors must not satisfy any
incoherence or restricted isometry property. A mathematical analysis proves the
sampling complexity of K-AHS as well as a general and sufficient condition for

PISNe of $\sim$140-260 $M_\odot$ and $\sim$65-120 $M_\odot$ respectively for
stars that are not much affected by the wind mass loss. The corresponding
relative event rate between PISNe and core collapse supernovae is estimated to
be $\sim$1% for the present-day initial mass function. However, no confident
PISN candidate has been detected so far, despite more than 1,000 supernovae are
discovered every recent years. We investigate the evolution of VMSs with
various core carbon-to-oxygen ratios for the first time, by introducing a
multiplication factor $f_{\rm cag} \in [ 0.1, 1.2 ]$ to the $^{12}$C($\alpha,
\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate. We find that a less massive VMS with a high
$X$(C)/$X$(O) develops shell convection during the core carbon-burning phase,
with which the star avoids the pair-creation instability. The second result is
the high explodability for a massive VMS, i.e., a star with high $X$(C)/$X$(O)
explodes with a smaller explosion energy. Consequently, the initial and the CO
core mass ranges for PISNe are significantly increased. Finally, a PISN with
high $X$(C)/$X$(O) yields smaller amount of $^{56}$Ni. Therefore, PISNe with
high $X$(C)/$X$(O) are much rarer and fainter to be detected. This result
advances the first theory to decrease the PISN event rate by directly shifting

of many modern large-scale parallel computation frameworks and has recently
gained a lot of importance, especially in the context of classic graph
problems. Unsatisfactorily, all current $\text{poly} (\log \log n)$-round MPC
algorithms seem to get fundamentally stuck at the linear-memory barrier: their
efficiency crucially relies on each machine having space at least linear in the
number $n$ of nodes. As this might not only be prohibitively large, but also
allows for easy if not trivial solutions for sparse graphs, we are interested
in the low-memory MPC model, where the space per machine is restricted to be
strongly sublinear, that is, $n^{\delta}$ for any $0<\delta<1$.
  We devise a degree reduction technique that reduces maximal matching and
maximal independent set in graphs with arboricity $\lambda$ to the
corresponding problems in graphs with maximum degree $\text{poly}(\lambda)$ in
$O(\log^2 \log n)$ rounds. This gives rise to $O\left(\log^2\log n +
T(\text{poly} \lambda)\right)$-round algorithms, where $T(\Delta)$ is the
$\Delta$-dependency in the round complexity of maximal matching and maximal
independent set in graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$. A concurrent work by
Ghaffari and Uitto shows that $T(\Delta)=O(\sqrt{\log \Delta})$.
  For graphs with arboricity $\lambda=\text{poly}(\log n)$, this almost
exponentially improves over Luby's $O(\log n)$-round PRAM algorithm [STOC'85,

which implicitly assumes that each particle carries an independent local hidden
variable, i.e., the presence of bilocality[2]. Previous experimental studies of
bilocal hidden variable models did not fulfill the central requirement that the
assumed two local hidden variable models must be mutually independent and hence
their conclusions are flawed on the rejection of local realism[3-5]. By
harnessing the laser phase randomization[6] rising from the spontaneous
emission to the stimulated emission to ensure the independence between
entangled photon-pairs created at separate sources and separating relevant
events spacelike to satisfy the no-signaling condition, for the first time, we
simultaneously close the loopholes of independent source, locality and
measurement independence in an entanglement swapping experiment in a network.
We measure a bilocal parameter of 1.181$\pm$0.004 and the CHSH game value of
2.652$\pm$0.059, indicating the rejection of bilocal hidden variable models by
45 standard deviations and local hidden variable models by 11 standard
deviations. We hence rule out local realism and justify the presence of quantum
nonlocality in our network experiment. Our experimental realization constitutes
a fundamental block for a large quantum network. Furthermore, we anticipate
that it may stimulate novel information processing applications[7,8].

provides a significant change in the computational power of quantum automata

recognize non-regular languages with cut-point, even in the presence of
Karp-Lipton advice, and (ii) recognize non-regular promise languages with
bounded-error. Furthermore, we study the cutpoint-union of cutpoint languages

structural inhomogeneities such as well width fluctuations. Special attention

been carried out in the framework of atomistic tight-binding theory. Our
theoretical investigations show that independent of the here studied well
widths, carrier localization effects due to built-in fields, well width
fluctuations and random alloy fluctuations dominate over Coulomb effects in
terms of charge density redistributions. However, the situation is less clear
cut when the well width fluctuations are absent. For large well width (approx.
> 2.5 nm) charge density redistributions are possible but the electronic and
optical properties are basically dominated by the spatial out-of plane carrier
separation originating from the electrostatic built-in field. The situation
changes for lower well width (< 2.5 nm) where the Coulomb effect can lead to
significant charge density redistributions and thus might compensate a large
fraction of the spatial in-plane wave function separation observed in a
single-particle picture. Given that this in-plane separation has been regarded
as one of the main drivers behind the green gap problem, our calculations
indicate that radiative recombination rates might significantly benefit from a

  The proved theorem on the fractional integral operator action is formulated
in terms of the Jacobi series coefficients and is of particular interest. We
obtain a sufficient condition for a representation of a function by the
fractional integral in terms of the Jacobi series coefficients. We consider
several modifications of the Jacobi polynomials what gives us an opportunity to
study the invariant property of the Riemann-Liouville operator. In this

respect the existing dependence between $X$ and $Z$ and thus account for the

Cand\`es et al. (2018), our test relies on the availability of an approximation
to the distribution of $X \mid Z$. While Cand\`es et al. (2018)'s test uses
this estimate to draw new $X$ values, for our test we use this approximation to
design an appropriate non-uniform distribution on permutations of the $X$

Monte Carlo sampler for the implementation of our method, and establish bounds
on the Type I error in terms of the error in the approximation of the
conditional distribution of $X\mid Z$, finding that, for the worst case test
statistic, the inflation in Type I error of the conditional permutation test is
no larger than that of the conditional randomization test. We validate these

used. Second, the results following from the large-$\beta_0$ approximation are
analyzed. Finally, the consequences of applying the asymptotic renormalon-based
formula are investigated. We show that all approaches lead to corrections which
are qualitatively consistent in order of magnitude. Their sign-alternating
character in powers of the number of massless quarks is demonstrated. We
emphasize that there is no contradiction in the behavior of the fine structure
of the renormalon-based estimates with other approaches if one use the detailed
information about the normalization factor included in the renormalon
asymptotic formula. The obtained five- and six-loop estimates indicate that in
the case of the $b$-quark the asymptotic character of the studied relation
manifests itself above the fourth order of PT, whereas for the $t$-quark it
starts to reveal itself after the seventh order. This allows to conclude that
like the running masses, the pole masses of the $b$ and especially $t$-quark in
principle may be used in the phenomenologically-oriented studies.

circularly polarised laser fields opens the path to generate isolated
attosecond pulses and attosecond pulse trains with controlled ellipticity. The
generated harmonics have alternating helicity, and the ellipticity of the
generated attosecond pulse depends sensitively on the relative intensities of
two adjacent, counter-rotating harmonic lines. For the $s$-type ground state,
such as in Helium, the successive harmonics have nearly equal amplitude,
yielding isolated attosecond pulses and attosecond pulse trains with linear
polarisation, rotated by 120$^{{\circ}}$ from pulse to pulse. In this work, we
suggest a solution to overcome the limitation associated with the $s$-type
ground state. It is based on modifying the three propensity rules associated
with the three steps of the harmonic generation process: ionisation,
propagation, and recombination. We control the first step by seeding high
harmonic generation with XUV light tuned well below the ionisation threshold,
which generates virtual excitations with the angular momentum co-rotating with
the $\omega$-field. We control the propagation step by increasing the intensity
of the $\omega$-field relative to the $2\omega$-field, further enhancing the
chance of the $\omega$-field being absorbed versus the $2\omega$-field, thus
favouring the emission co-rotating with the seed and the $\omega-$field. We
demonstrate our proposed control scheme using Helium atom as a target and
solving time-dependent Schr{\""o}dinger equation in two and three-dimensions.

In our approach market states are identified by a reference sparse precision
matrix and a vector of expectation values. In our procedure, each multivariate
observation is associated with a given market state accordingly to a
minimization of a penalized Mahalanobis distance. The procedure is made
computationally very efficient and can be used with a large number of assets.
We demonstrate that this procedure is successful at clustering different states
of the markets in an unsupervised manner. In particular, we describe an
experiment with one hundred log-returns and two states in which the methodology
automatically associates states prevalently to pre- and post- crisis periods
with one state gathering periods with average positive returns and the other
state periods with average negative returns, therefore discovering
spontaneously the common classification of `bull' and `bear' markets. In
another experiment, with again one hundred log-returns and two states, we
demonstrate that this procedure can be efficiently used to forecast off-sample
future market states with significant prediction accuracy. This methodology
opens the way to a range of applications in risk management and trading
strategies in the context where the correlation structure plays a central role.

However, the performance of hotspot detectors relies highly on the quality of

that the interactions between such fields offer a clear distinction between

the underlying streets (note: entire streets rather than street segments),
which enables us to see scaling or fractal or living structure of far more
less-connected streets than well-connected ones. It is this underlying scaling
structure that makes human activities predictable, albeit in the sense of
collective rather than individual human moving behavior. This topological
analysis has not yet received its deserved attention in the literature, as many
researchers continue to rely on segment analysis for predicting human
activities. The segment-analysis-based methods are essentially geometric, with
a focus on geometric details of locations, lengths, and directions, and are
unable to reveal the scaling property, which means they cannot be used for
human activities prediction. We conducted a series of case studies using London
streets and tweet location data, based on related concepts such as natural
streets, and natural street segments (or street segments for short), axial
lines, and axial line segments (or line segments for short). We found that
natural streets are the best representation in terms of human activities or
traffic prediction, followed by axial lines, and that neither street segments
nor line segments bear a good correlation between network parameters and tweet
locations. These findings point to the fact that the reason why axial
lines-based space syntax, or the kind of topological analysis in general, works
has little to do with individual human travel behavior or ways that human
conceptualize distances or spaces. Instead, it is the underlying scaling
hierarchy of streets - numerous least-connected, a very few most-connected, and
some in between the least- and most-connected - that makes human activities
predictable.
