SWCX emission is a serious impediment to the study of the diffuse hot ISM,

is temporally variable. Modeling the SWCX emission, in order to remove it from
our observations, has proven to be more difficult than originally anticipated.
This work reviews our current understanding of SWCX emission, with special
attention to all of the components required for future modeling tools. Since,
in the absence of such a tool, observing programs can still be constructed to

aspects of SWCX will be very difficult to characterize, progress continues on

flocking bifurcation of the two-dimensional Vicsek model exhibits an interplay
between parabolic and hyperbolic behavior. For box sizes smaller than a certain
large value, flocking appears continuously from a uniform disordered state at a
critical value of the noise. Because of mass conservation, the amplitude
equations describing the flocking state consist of a scalar equation for the
density disturbance from the homogeneous particle density (particle number
divided by box area) and a vector equation for a current density. These two
equations contain two time scales. At the shorter scale, they are a hyperbolic
system in which time and space scale in the same way. At the longer, diffusive,
time scale, the equations are parabolic. The bifurcating solution depends on
the angle and is uniform in space as in the normal form of the usual pitchfork
bifurcation. We show that linearization about the latter solution is described
by a Klein-Gordon equation in the hyperbolic time scale. Then there are
persistent oscillations with many incommensurate frequencies about the
bifurcating solution, they produce a shift in the critical noise and resonate
with a periodic forcing of the alignment rule. These predictions are confirmed
by direct numerical simulations of the Vicsek model.

generalizing beyond what has been achieved by direct calculations in previous

excitations emerging in strongly correlated quantum systems, such as Laughlin
states in the fractional quantum Hall effect, Luttinger quasiparticles, or
parafermions. Here, we consider topological transitions in the full counting
statistics of standard sequential electron tunneling, and find that they lead
to the same type of charge fractionalization - strikingly without requiring
exotic quantum correlations. This conclusion relies on the realization that
fundamental integer charge quantization fixes the global properties of the
transport statistics whereas fractional charges can only be well-defined
locally. We then show that the reconciliation of these two contradicting
notions results in a nontrivially quantized geometric phase defined in the
detector space. In doing so, we show that detector degrees of freedom can be
used to describe topological transitions in nonequilibrium open quantum
systems. Moreover, the quantized geometric phase reveals a profound analogy
between the fractional charge effect in sequential tunneling and fractional
Josephson effect in topological superconducting junctions, where likewise the
Majorana- or parafermions exhibit a charge which is at odds with the Cooper
pair charge as the underlying unit of the supercurrent. In order to provide
means for an experimental verification of our claims, we demonstrate the
fractional nature of transport statistics at the example of highly feasible
transport models, such as weakly tunnel-coupled quantum dots or charge islands.
We then show that the geometric phase can be accessed through the detector's
waiting time distribution. Finally, we find that topological transitions in the
transport statistics could even lead to new applications, such as the
unexpected possibility to directly measure features beyond the resolution limit
of a detector.

OAS with Bayesian recovery and hard adaptation significantly outperforms the

aspects, two computationally tractable algorithms are proposed, and their
performances are compared against the state-of-the-art non-adaptive algorithms

line up well with independent simulations and previous studies that manually
compared simulated GC models with observed properties of Galactic GCs. These

determining the injection current tensor in these materials. We also find that
compression along the polar axis can increase the injection current (or change

through the $_4\phi_3$ basic hypergeometric function. Under suitable limits,
the $q$-Hahn PushTASEP degenerates to all known integrable (1+1)-dimensional

evolution of planetary systems into the post-main sequence phase. HD 47366, an

dynamically unstable on timescales much shorter than the stellar age unless the
planets are trapped in mutual 2:1 mean motion resonance, inconsistent with the
orbital solution presented in \cite{2016Sato} (hereafter: S16), or are moving
on mutually retrograde orbits. Here we examine the orbital stability of the
system presented in S16 using the $n$-body code {\sc Mercury} over a broad
range of $a$--$e$ parameter space consistent with the observed radial
velocities, assuming they are on co-planar orbits. Our analysis confirms that
the system as proposed in S16 is not dynamically stable. We therefore undertake
a thorough re-analysis of the available observational data for the HD 47366
system, through the Levenberg-Marquardt technique and confirmed by MCMC
Bayesian methodology. Our re-analysis reveals an alternative, lower
eccentricity fit that is vastly preferred over the highly eccentric orbital
solution obtained from the nominal best-fit presented in S16. The new, improved
dynamical simulation solution reveals the reduced eccentricity of the planetary
orbits, shifting the HD 47366 system into the edge of a broad stability region,
increasing our confidence that the planets are all that they seem to be. Our
rigorous examination of the dynamical stability of HD 47366 stands as a
cautionary tale in finding the global best-fit model.

limited to experiments that cannot be implemented into actual applications.
This poses a significant bottleneck to the advancement of NFRHT research. Here,
we describe devices bridging laboratory-scale measurements and potential NFRHT
engineering applications in energy conversion and thermal management. We report
a maximum NFRHT enhancement of ~ 28.5 over the blackbody limit with devices
made of millimeter-sized doped silicon (Si) surfaces separated by vacuum gap
spacings down to ~ 110 nm. The devices capitalize on micropillars, separating
the high-temperature emitter and low-temperature receiver, manufactured within
micrometer-deep pits. These micropillars, which are ~ 4.5 to 45 times longer
than the nanosize vacuum spacing where radiation transfer takes place, minimize
parasitic heat conduction without sacrificing device structural integrity. The
robustness of our devices enables gap spacing visualization via scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) prior to performing NFRHT measurements. Direct gap
spacing characterization is critical for transitioning NFRHT research from
laboratory-scale experiments to applications.

(shell flashes fueled by thick helium piles) with the ill-understood phenomenon
of strong flux fluctuations. Nine such bursts have been discussed in the
literature to date. Swift is particularly suitable for finding additional
examples. We find and list a total of 134 X-ray bursts; 44 are detected with
BAT only, 41 with XRT only, and 49 with both. Twenty-eight bursts involve
automatic slews. We find 12 intermediate-duration bursts, all detected in
observations involving automatic slews. Five show remarkably long
Eddington-limited phases in excess of 200 s. Five show fluctuations during the
decay phase; four of which are first discussed in the present study. We discuss
the general properties of the fluctuations, considering also 7 literature
cases. In general two types of fluctuations are observed: fast ones, with a
typical timescale of 1 s and up and downward fluctuations of up to 70%, and
slow ones, with a typical timescale of 1 min and only downward fluctuations of
up to 90%. The latter look like partial eclipses because the burst decay
remains visible in the residual emission. We revisit the interpretation of this
phenomenon in the context of the new data set and find that it has not changed
fundamentally despite the expanded data set. It is thought to be due to a
disturbance of the accretion disk by outflowing matter and photons, causing
obscuration and reflection due to Thompson scattering in an orbiting highly
ionized cloud or structure above or below the disk. We discuss in detail the
most pronounced burster SAX J1712.6-3739. One of the bursts from this source is
unusual in that it lasts longer than 5600 s, but does not appear to be a

  Prof. Giorgio Palumbo",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent hypothesis of a giant supercluster binary-like structure formed by
the Corona Borealis and its close companion Abell 2142 (supercluster) belongs
to a little known area of investigation as the dynamics of gravitationally
interacting galaxy supercluster pairs. From the observational point of view
this structure approximates the configuration of a binary-like system in linear
orbit interconnected by a huge filamentary structure which, if confirmed, it
would be the first case to date observed at z > 0.07. Given the importance to
disentangle this issue, a follow-up analysis has been performed on the region
constrained by the common envelop of the two superclusters in order to search
for new hints to confirm their mutual gravitational interaction. Observational
signatures of that interaction have been found mapping the inner peculiar
motions where the observed negative peculiar velocities measured within the
A2142 (supercluster) region suggest a general matter flow toward the Corona
Borealis supercluster. Besides, analyzing the effects on both superclusters due
to the mutual impact of the external tidal forces, turns out that their inner
dynamics remain unperturbed up to the turnaround radii. Outside, where the
binding forces are overlapped by the tidal ones, the outskirts of both
superclusters should be unstable and subject to fragmentation. Such a scenario
indicates that both superclusters interact with comparable and reciprocal tidal
perturbations leaving the whole system in a substantial dynamical equilibrium.
The origin of such a dynamical dichotomy would be explained either by a much
more massive Corona Borealis supercluster than that estimated in the present
work or by a selection effect biasing the small sample of peculiar velocities
due to the remoteness of the system worsened by the large uncertainty on their
measurements.

cyber-physical systems. Hybrid system models describe the required interplay of
computation and physical dynamics, which is crucial to guarantee what
computations lead to safe physical behavior (e.g., cars should not collide).
Control computations that affect physical dynamics must act in advance to avoid
possibly unsafe future circumstances. Formal verification then ensures that the
controllers correctly identify and provably avoid unsafe future situations
under a certain model of physics. But any model of physics necessarily deviates
from reality and, moreover, any observation with real sensors and manipulation
with real actuators is subject to uncertainty. This makes runtime validation a
crucial step to monitor whether the model assumptions hold for the real system
implementation.
  The key question is what property needs to be runtime-monitored and what a
satisfied runtime monitor entails about the safety of the system: the
observations of a runtime monitor only relate back to the safety of the system

construction of the 3D Apollonius diagram (also known as the 3D Additively
Weighted Voronoi diagram), namely the EdgeConflict predicate: given five sites
$S_i, S_j,S_k,S_l,S_m$ that define an edge $e_{ijklm}$ in the 3D Apollonius
diagram, and a sixth query site $S_q$, the predicate determines the portion of
$e_{ijklm}$ that will disappear in the Apollonius diagram of the six sites due
to the insertion of $S_q$.
  Our focus is on the algorithmic analysis of the predicate with the aim to
minimize its algebraic degree. We decompose the main predicate into three
sub-predicates, which are then evaluated with the aid of four additional
primitive operations. We show that the maximum algebraic degree required to
answer any of the sub-predicates and primitives, and, thus, our main predicate
is 10.
  Among the tools we use is the 3D inversion transformation. In the scope of
this paper and due to space limitations, only non-degenerate configurations are
considered, i.e. different Voronoi vertices are distinct and the predicates
never return a degenerate answer. Most of our analysis is carried out in the
inverted space, which is where our geometric observations and analysis is
captured in algebraic terms.

transients, such as core-collapse supernovae (SN) and powerful non-terminal
outbursts (SN impostors). Dedicated spectroscopic facilities can follow up
these events shortly after detection. Here we investigate the properties of
these explosions at early times. We use the radiative transfer code CMFGEN to
build an extensive library of spectra simulating the interaction of supernovae
and their progenitor's winds/circumstellar medium (CSM). We consider a range of
progenitor mass-loss rates (Mdot = 5e-4 to 1e-2 Msun/yr), abundances (solar,
CNO-processed, and He-rich), and SN luminosities (L = 1.9e8 to 2.5e10 Lsun).
The models simulate events ~1 day after explosion, and we assume a fixed
location of the shock front as Rin=8.6e13 cm. We show that the large range of
massive star properties at the pre-SN stage causes a diversity of early-time
interacting SN and impostors. We identify three main classes of early-time
spectra consisting of relatively high-ionisation (e.g. Ovi), medium-ionisation
(e.g. Ciii), and low-ionisation lines (e.g. Feii/iii). They are regulated by L
and the CSM density. Given a progenitor wind velocity Vinf, our models also
place a lower limit of Mdot > 5e-4 (Vinf/150 km/s) Msun/yr for detection of CSM
interaction signatures in observed spectra. Early-time SN spectra should
provide clear constraints on progenitors by measuring H, He, and CNO abundances
if the progenitors come from single stars. The connections are less clear
considering the effects of binary evolution. Yet, our models provide a clear
path for linking the final stages of massive stars to their post-explosion
spectra at early times, and guiding future observational follow-up of
transients with facilities such as the Zwicky Transient Facility.

understanding the mechanisms of planet formation. The dynamics of small grains
in the disc is stiffly coupled to the gas, while the dynamics of grown solids
is decoupled. Moreover, in some parts of the disc the concentration of the dust
is low (dust to gas mass ratio is about 0.01), while in other parts it can be
much higher. These factors place high requirements on the numerical methods for
disc simulations. In particular, when gas and dust are simulated with two
different fluids, explicit methods require very small timestep (must be less
than dust stopping time $t_{\rm stop}$ during which the velocity of a solid
particle is equalized with respect to the gas velocity) to obtain solution,
while some implicit methods requires high temporal resolution to obtain
acceptable accuracy. Moreover, recent studies underlined that for Smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH) when the gas and the dust are simulated with
different sets of particles only high spatial resolution $h<c_{\rm s} t_{\rm
stop}$ guaranties suppression of numerical overdissipation due to gas and dust
interaction.
  To address these problems, we developed a fast algorithm based on the ideas
of (1) implicit integration of linear (Epstein) drag and (2) exact conservation
of local linear momentum. We derived formulas for monodisperse dust-gas in
two-fluid SPH and tested the new method on problems with known analytical
solutions. We found that our method is a promising alternative for the
previously developed two-fluid SPH scheme in case of stiff linear drag thanks
to the fact that spatial resolution condition $h<c_{\rm s} t_{\rm stop}$ is not
required anymore for accurate results.

deprojected cross-correlation of galaxy clusters found in the Planck survey
with galaxies detected photometrically in the Pan-STARRS survey, shows a sharp
steepening feature (a logarithmic slope steeper than $-3$), which we associate
with the splashback radius. We infer the three-dimensional splashback radius
for the SZ cluster sample to be $r_{\rm sp}=1.85_{-0.30}^{+0.26}$ $h^{-1}$Mpc,
where the cluster sample has an average halo mass
$M_{500c}=3.0\times10^{14}h^{-1}M_\odot$ at an average redshift of $z=0.18$.
The inferred value of the splashback radius appears consistent with the
expected location for dark matter halos in the standard cold dark matter
paradigm. However, given the limited precision of our measurements, we cannot
conclusively rule out the smaller splashback radius measured so far in the
literature for optically selected galaxy clusters. We show that the splashback
radius does not depend upon the galaxy magnitude for galaxies fainter than
$M_i-5\log h=-19.44$, and is present at a consistent location in galaxy
populations divided by color. The presence of the splashback radius in the
star-forming galaxy population could potentially be used to put lower limits on
the quenching timescales for galaxies. We can marginally rule out the
contamination of the star-forming galaxy sample by quenched galaxies, but the
results would need further verification with deeper datasets.

fast algorithms for computing the drag force (momentum transfer) between solid

be used to calculate the momentum transfer between dust and gas instead of

equations for dust, and the collisionless Boltzmann equation for large bodies.
Preliminary results of supercomputer simulation of the gas-dust disc dynamics

machine learning requires easily accessible but noisy sources, such as
crowdsourcing services or tagged Web data. Noisy labels occur frequently in
data sets harvested via these means, sometimes resulting in entire classes of
data on which learned classifiers generalize poorly. For real world
applications, we argue that it can be beneficial to avoid training on such
classes entirely. In this work, we aim to explore the classes in a given data
set, and guide supervised training to spend time on a class proportional to its
learnability. By focusing the training process, we aim to improve model
generalization on classes with a strong signal. To that end, we develop an
online algorithm that works in conjunction with classifier and training
algorithm, iteratively selecting training data for the classifier based on how
well it appears to generalize on each class. Testing our approach on a variety
of data sets, we show our algorithm learns to focus on classes for which the
model has low generalization error relative to strong baselines, yielding a
classifier with good performance on learnable classes.

intelligence and interstellar travel are limited to cursory descriptions where
little detail is given about the nature of the artificial intelligence. This
article explores the role of artificial intelligence for interstellar travel by
compiling use cases, exploring capabilities, and proposing typologies, system

specific types of interstellar probes are given, along with potential system
and mission architectures, covering those proposed in the literature but also
presenting novel ones. Finally, a generic design for interstellar probes with
an AI payload is proposed. Given current levels of increase in computational
power, a spacecraft with a similar computational power as the human brain would
have a mass from dozens to hundreds of tons in a 2050-2060 timeframe. Given
that the advent of the first interstellar missions and artificial general
intelligence are estimated to be by the mid-21st century, a more in-depth
exploration of the relationship between the two should be attempted, focusing
on neglected areas such as protecting the artificial intelligence payload from

signal. We compare the results with models for a number of processes that may
produce polarized light in a planetary system to determine if we can rule out
any phenomena with this limit. Models of reflected light from thick clouds can
approach or exceed this limit, but such clouds are unlikely at the high
temperature of the WASP-18b atmosphere. Additionally, we model the expected
polarization resulting from the transit of the planet across the star and find
this has an amplitude of about 1.6 ppm, which is well below our detection

as unaccreted, galaxies that were distinct before accretion onto the main group
as single, and galaxies that were in external sub-groups before accretion onto
the main group as grouped.
  The unaccreted galaxy population experiences steady growth in dark matter,
gas and stellar mass. Both single- and group-accreted galaxies begin to lose
dark matter and gas after first accretion onto any host but continue to grow in
stellar mass. Individual trajectories show that galaxies cease mass growth
within roughly three virial radii of the main group. Single galaxies continue
to form stars until the group virial radius is crossed, when they begin to lose
both dark matter and gas. Grouped galaxies peak in mass when joining their
external sub-group, indicating that they experience preprocessing. Most
accreted galaxies retain their accumulated stellar mass. The total mass loss is
dominated by tidal stripping, with evidence for additional gas stripping via
ram pressure. Most accreted galaxies are quenched $\sim$(0.5-2.5) Gyr after
accretion onto any group.
  These differing histories place unaccreted, single and grouped galaxies in
distinct regions of the stellar mass-to-halo mass (SMHM) relation. This
suggests that preprocessed galaxies are a key source of scatter in the SMHM
relation for mixed galaxy populations.

grails of modern astrophysics. Astrophysicists survey large volumes of the
Universe and employ a large ensemble of computer simulations to compare with
the observed data in order to extract the full information of our own Universe.
However, to evolve trillions of galaxies over billions of years even with the

extensive analysis, demonstrates that D$^3$M outperforms the second order
perturbation theory (hereafter 2LPT), the commonly used fast approximate
simulation method, in point-wise comparison, 2-point correlation, and 3-point
correlation. We also show that D$^3$M is able to accurately extrapolate far
beyond its training data, and predict structure formation for significantly
different cosmological parameters. Our study proves, for the first time, that
deep learning is a practical and accurate alternative to approximate

adversarial examples, there has been a flood of research into defending and
attacking machine learning models. However, almost all proposed attacks assume
white-box access to a model. In other words, the attacker is assumed to have
perfect knowledge of the models weights and architecture. With this insider
knowledge, a white-box attack can leverage gradient information to craft
adversarial examples. Black-box attacks assume no knowledge of the model
weights or architecture. These attacks craft adversarial examples using
information only contained in the logits or hard classification label. Here, we
assume the attacker can use the logits in order to find an adversarial example.
Empirically, we show that 2-sided stochastic gradient estimation techniques are
not sensitive to scaling parameters, and can be used to mount powerful
black-box attacks requiring relatively few model queries.

where accretion onto the compact object occurs via the radially outflowing
stellar wind of its early B-type companion. We present an analysis of the
system's X-ray variability and periodic modulation using pointed observations
(2.5-25 keV) and Galactic bulge scans (2-10 keV) from the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer (RXTE) Proportional Counter Array (PCA), along with Swift Burst Alert
Telescope (BAT) 70-month snapshot (14-195 keV) and transient monitor (15-50
keV) observations. The orbital eclipse profiles in the PCA bulge scans and BAT
light curves are modeled using asymmetric and symmetric step and ramp
functions. We obtain an improved orbital period measurement of 6.7828 $\pm$
0.0004 days from an observed minus calculated (O-C) analysis of mid-eclipse
times derived from the BAT transient monitor and PCA scan data. No evidence is
found for the presence of a strong photoionization or accretion wake. We refine
the superorbital period to 20.067 $\pm$ 0.009 days from the discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) of the BAT transient monitor light curve. A pulse period of
1093.1036 $\pm$ 0.0004 s is measured from a pulsar timing analysis using
pointed PCA observations spanning $\sim$1.4 binary orbits. We present pulse
times of arrival (ToAs), circular and eccentric timing models, and calculations
of the system's Keplerian binary orbital parameters. We derive an X-ray mass
function of $f_{x}(M)$ $=$ 13.2$^{+2.4}_{-2.5}$ $M_{\odot}$ and find a spectral
type of B0.5 Ia for the supergiant companion through constraints on the mass
and radius of the donor. Measurements of the eclipse half-angle and additional
parameters describing the system geometry are provided.

blueshifted velocity component (HVC) tracing microjets, and a less blueshifted
low-velocity-component (LVC) attributed to winds. We focus here on the LVC
kinematics to investigate links between winds, jets, accretion, and disk
dispersal. We track the behavior of four types of LVC components: a broad and
narrow component (""BC"" and ""NC"") in LVCs that are decomposed into two
Gaussians, which typically have an HVC, and the single-Gaussian LVC profiles
separated into those that have an HVC (""SCJ"") and those that do not (""SC""). LVC
centroid velocities and line widths correlate with HVC equivalent width and
accretion luminosity, suggesting that LVC/winds and HVC/jets are kinematically
linked and connected to accretion. The deprojected HVC velocity correlates with
accretion luminosity, showing that faster jets come with higher accretion. BC
and NC kinematics correlate and their blueshifts are maximum at $\sim
35^{\circ}$, suggesting a conical wind geometry with this semi-opening angle.
Only SCs include $n_{13-31}$ up to $\sim3$ and their properties correlate with
this infrared index, showing that [OI] emission recedes to larger radii as the
inner dust is depleted, tracing less dense/hot gas and a decrease in wind
velocity. All together, these findings support a scenario where optically
thick, accreting inner disks launch radially-extended MHD disk winds that feed
jets, and where inner disk winds recede to larger radii and jets disappear in
concert with dust depletion.

galactic properties including stellar mass, effective radius, stellar surface
density, central velocity dispersion, central dark matter fraction and
in-situ-formed stellar mass ratio are compared to observations and other
simulations, revealing that IllustrisTNG reproduces many correlation trends,
and in particular, $\gamma^{\prime}$ is almost constant with redshift below $z

kinetic winds are crucial to lowering $\gamma^{\prime}$ and matching observed
galaxy correlations. The effects of stellar winds on $\gamma^{\prime}$ are
subdominant compared to AGN feedback, and differ due to the presence of AGN
feedback from previous works. The density profiles of the ETG dark matter halos
are well-described by steeper-than-NFW profiles, and they are steeper in the
full physics (FP) run than their counterparts in the dark matter only (DMO)
run. Their inner density slopes anti-correlates (remain constant) with the halo
mass in the FP (DMO) run, and anti-correlates with the halo concentration
parameter $c_{200}$ in both types of runs. The dark matter halos of low-mass
ETGs are contracted whereas high-mass ETGs are expanded, suggesting that
variations in the total density profile occur through the different halo

uncertain. To provide better constraints, we apply the large velocity gradient
method to a series of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies and derive the

starbursts and post-burst phases. We show that estimating the star formation

distinction between disks and starbursts. We find a tighter correlation of
$\alpha_{\rm CO}$ with the gas depletion time than with star formation rate,

cluster environment as a laboratory. Satellite galaxies in clusters move at
high velocities, making mergers between them rare. The stellar mass-size
relation in ten clusters and in the field is measured and compared at
$z~\mathtt{\sim}~1$. Our cluster sample contains 344
spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members with Gemini/GMOS and 182 confirmed
with HST WFC3 G141 grism spectroscopy. On average, quiescent and star-forming
cluster galaxies are smaller than their field counterparts by ($0.08\pm0.04$)
dex and ($0.07\pm0.01$) dex respectively. These size offsets are consistent
with the average sizes of quiescent and star-forming field galaxies between
$1.2\leqslant z\leqslant1.5$, implying the cluster environment has inhibited
size growth between this period and $z~\mathtt{\sim}~1$. The negligible
differences measured between the $z~\mathtt{\sim}~0$ field and cluster
quiescent mass-size relations in other works imply that the average size of
quiescent cluster galaxies must rise with decreasing redshift. Using a toy
model, we show that the disappearance of the compact cluster galaxies might be
explained if, on average, $\mathtt{\sim}40\%$ of them merge with their
brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and $\mathtt{\sim}60\%$ are tidally destroyed
into the intra-cluster light (ICL) between $0\leqslant z\leqslant1$. This is in
agreement with the observed stellar mass growth of BCGs between $0\leqslant
z\leqslant1$ and the observed ICL stellar mass fraction at $z~\mathtt{\sim}~0$.
Our results support minor mergers as the cause for the size growth in quiescent
field galaxies, with cluster-specific processes responsible for the similarity
between the field and cluster quiescent mass-size relations at low redshift.

transiting, but most lack sufficient follow-up observations to confidently
detect (or rule out) transits. We use published stellar, orbital, and planetary
parameters to estimate the transit probabilities for nearly all exoplanets that

that $25.5^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$ of the known RV exoplanets should transit their host
stars. This prediction is more than double the amount of RV exoplanets that are
currently known to transit. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)
presents a valuable opportunity to explore the transiting nature of many of the
known RV exoplanet systems. Based on the anticipated pointing of TESS during
its two-year primary mission, we identify the known RV exoplanets that it will
observe and predict that $11.7^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ of them will have transits
detected by TESS. However, we only expect the discovery of transits for $\sim$3
of these exoplanets to be novel (i.e., not previously known). We predict that
the TESS photometry will yield dispositive null results for the transits of
$\sim$125 RV exoplanets. This will represent a substantial increase in the
effort to refine ephemerides of known RV exoplanets. We demonstrate that these
results are robust to changes in the ecliptic longitudes of future TESS
observing sectors. Finally, we consider how several potential TESS extended

expressions. Such systems are exemplified by molecular switches, which exchange
heat with a bath. These molecules can photoisomerize, or change conformation,
or switch, upon absorbing light. The photoisomerization probability depends on
kinetic details that couple the molecule's energetics to its dissipation.
Therefore, a simple, general, thermodynamic-style bound on the
photoisomerization probability seems out of reach. We derive such a bound using
a resource theory. The resource-theory framework is a set of mathematical
tools, developed in quantum information theory, used to generalize
thermodynamics to small and quantum settings. From this toolkit has been
derived a generalization of the second law, the thermomajorization preorder. We
use thermomajorization to upper-bound the photoisomerization probability. Then,
we compare the bound with an equilibrium prediction and with a Lindbladian
model. We identify a realistic parameter regime in which the Lindbladian
evolution saturates the thermomajorization bound. We also quantify the energy
coherence in the electronic degree of freedom, and we argue that this coherence
cannot promote photoisomerization. This work illustrates how
quantum-information-theoretic thermodynamics can elucidate complex quantum
processes in nature, experiments, and synthetics.

constrain galaxy formation models. Here, we provide a modern quantitative
assessment of those relations, by modelling the rotation curves of galaxies
from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database with
the Einasto dark halo model. We focus in particular on the comparison between
the original SPARC parameters, with constant mass-to-light ratios for bulges
and disks, and the parameters for which galaxies follow the tightest radial
acceleration relation. We show that fits are improved in the second case, and
that the pure halo scaling relations also become tighter. We report that the
density at the radius where the slope is -2 is strongly anticorrelated to this
radius, and to the Einasto index. The latter is close to unity for a large
number of galaxies, indicative of large cores. In terms of dark matter-baryon
scalings, we focus on relations between the core properties and the extent of
the baryonic component, which are relevant to the cusp-core transformation
process. We report a positive correlation between the core size of halos with
small Einasto index and the stellar disk scale-length, as well as between the
averaged dark matter density within 2 kpc and the baryon-induced rotational
velocity at that radius. This finding is related to the consequence of the
radial acceleration relation on the diversity of rotation curve shapes,
quantified by the rotational velocity at 2 kpc. While a tight radial
acceleration relation slightly decreases the observed diversity compared to the
original SPARC parameters, the diversity of baryon-induced accelerations at 2
kpc is sufficient to induce a large diversity, incompatible with current
hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, while maintaining a tight
radial acceleration relation.

assumptions about the halo model. We compare four different models: spherical
isothermal and Navarro-Frenk-White halos, along with spherical and elliptical
Burkert halos. For both kinematics and lensing we find examples where different
models fit the data well but give enclosed masses that are inconsistent with
the true (i.e., input) values. This is especially notable when the input and
fit models differ in having cored or cuspy profiles (such as fitting an NFW

technique that monitors and corrects frequency variations in single photon
sources based on microring resonators. By using the same classical laser fields
required for photon generation as a probe to diagnose variations in the
resonator frequency, our protocol applies feedback control to correct photon
frequency errors in parallel to the optical quantum computation without
disturbing the physical qubit. We implement our technique on a silicon photonic
device and demonstrate sub 1 pm frequency stabilization in the presence of
applied environmental noise, corresponding to a fractional frequency drift of
<1 % of a photon linewidth. Using these methods we demonstrate feedback
controlled quantum state engineering. By distributing a single local oscillator
across a single chip or network of chips, our approach enables frequency
locking of many single photon sources for large-scale photonic quantum
technologies.

$H_{\phi}^{5}(G;\mathbb{Z})\oplus H_{\phi}^{1}(G;\mathbb{Z})$ for all 230 space
groups $G$, where $H^n_\phi(G;\mathbb{Z})$ denotes the $n$th twisted group
cohomology of $G$ with $\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients, and $\phi$ indicates that
$g\in G$ acts non-trivially on coefficients by sending them to their inverses
if $g$ reverses spacetime orientation and acts trivially otherwise. The
previously known summand $H_{\phi}^{5}(G;\mathbb{Z})$ corresponds only to
crystalline phases built without the $E_8$ state or its multiples on 2-cells of
space. It is the crystalline analogue of the ""group cohomology proposal"" for
classifying bosonic symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, which takes
the form $H_{\phi}^{d+2}(G;\mathbb{Z})\cong H_{\phi}^{d+1}(G;U(1))$ for finite
internal symmetry groups in $d$ spatial dimensions. The new summand
$H_{\phi}^{1}(G;\mathbb{Z})$ classifies possible configurations of $E_8$ states
on 2-cells that can be used to build crystalline phases beyond the group
cohomology proposal. The completeness of our classification and the physical
meaning of $H_{\phi}^{1}(G;\mathbb{Z})$ are established through a combination
of dimensional reduction, surface topological order, and explicit cellular
construction. The value of $H_{\phi}^{1}(G;\mathbb{Z})$ can be easily read off
from the international symbol for $G$. Our classification agrees with the
prediction of the ""generalized cohomology hypothesis,"" which concerns the
general structure of the classification of SPT phases, and therefore provides
strong evidence for the validity of the said hypothesis in the realm of
crystalline symmetries.

functions (\textsf{RIF}s), variants, and numeric functions often have a direct
or indirect role in contaminating algorithms. Some solutions that seek to
replace or avoid them have been proposed and investigated by the present author
in some of her earlier papers. Because multiple kinds of solution are of
interest to the contamination problem, granular generalizations of RIFs are
proposed, and investigated. Interesting representation results are proved and a
core algebraic strategy for generalizing Skowron-Polkowski style of rough
mereology (though for a very different purpose) is formulated. A number of
examples have been added to illustrate key parts of the proposal in higher

magnetically active, low-mass stars. Recently Somers et. al. 2017 showed that
radius inflation among low-mass stars in the young open cluster M45 (Pleiades
Cluster) is correlated to the rotation rate: faster rotators are more inflated.
Here we extend that work to a sample of 68 stars of the older open Hyades
Cluster. We derive the stars' spectral energy distributions to measure their
bolometric fluxes. With spectroscopically defined $T_{\rm eff}$ and {\it
Gaia\/} distances we calculate stellar radii using the Stefan-Boltzmann
relation. We find numerous stars that exhibit significant (3-4$\sigma$) radius
inflation relative to a nominal cluster isochrone. We compare these results to
that of the younger Pleiades and consider radius inflation as a function of
open cluster evolution. We find that unlike the Pleiades, there is not a
statistically significant correlation between radius inflation and stellar
rotation period. However, we do find that most inflated stars have (rapid)
rotational Rossby numbers of 0.1--0.2, such that the correlation of radius
inflation with Rossby number is statistically significant at 99.98\%
confidence. Since the canonical rotation-activity relation of low-mass stars is
understood to result from the connection between magnetic activity and surface
convection, our results imply that magnetic activity within the convective
layers of low-mass stars is what preferentially drives radius inflation

fully ionized plasmas mediated by stratification and 3D geometrical effects. In
Paper I, Cally & Khomenko (2015) have shown that in a weakly ionized plasma,
such as the solar photosphere and chromosphere, the Hall current introduces a
new coupling mechanism. The present study extends the results from Paper I to
the case of warm plasma. We report on numerical experiments where mode
transformation is studied using quasi-realistic stratification in thermodynamic
parameters resembling the solar atmosphere. This redresses the limitation of
the cold plasma approximation assumed in Paper I, in particular allowing the
complete process of coupling between fast and slow magneto-acoustic modes and
subsequent coupling of the fast mode to the Alfv\'en mode through the Hall
current. Our results confirm the efficacy of the mechanism proposed in Paper I
for the solar case. We observe that the efficiency of the transformation is a
sensitive function of the angle between the wave propagation direction and the
magnetic field, and of the wave frequency. The efficiency increases when the
field direction and the wave direction are aligned for increasing wave
frequencies. After scaling our results to typical solar values, the maximum
amplitude of the transformed Alfv\'en waves, for a frequency of 1 Hz,
corresponds to an energy flux (measured above the height of peak Hall coupling)
of $\sim10^3$ $\rm W\,m^{-2}$, based on an amplitude of 500 $\rm m\,s^{-1}$ at
$\beta=1$, which is sufficient to play a major role in both quiet and active
region coronal heating.

new paradigm for designing neural networks with multidimensional (tensor) data.
Our network architecture is based on the $t$-product (Kilmer and Martin, 2011),
an algebraic formulation to multiply tensors via circulant convolution. In this
$t$-product algebra, we interpret tensors as $t$-linear operators analogous to
matrices as linear operators, and hence our framework inherits mimetic matrix
properties. To exemplify the elegant, matrix-mimetic algebraic structure of our
$t$-NNs, we expand on recent work (Haber and Ruthotto, 2017) which interprets
deep neural networks as discretizations of non-linear differential equations
and introduces stable neural networks which promote superior generalization.
Motivated by this dynamic framework, we introduce a stable $t$-NN which
facilitates more rapid learning because of its reduced, more powerful
parameterization. Through our high-dimensional design, we create a more compact
parameter space and extract multidimensional correlations otherwise latent in
traditional algorithms. We further generalize our $t$-NN framework to a family
of tensor-tensor products (Kernfeld, Kilmer, and Aeron, 2015) which still
induce a matrix-mimetic algebraic structure. Through numerical experiments on
the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we demonstrate the more powerful
parameterizations and improved generalizability of stable $t$-NNs.

Furthermore, the current moons of Uranus can be reproduced by our model without
the need for planet-planet impact to create a debris disk for the moons to

which has started to been observed. An exciting claim has been made recently by
Silk (2017): that early feedback by IMBHs in gas-rich dwarf galaxies at
$z=5-8$, can potentially solve multiple dwarf galaxy problems within the
$\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter cosmology. We are performing Cosmological
Hydrodynamical Simulations of $(2 Mpc)^3$ volumes, starting from $z=100$, to
test the case for IMBHs in Dwarf Galaxies. Black holes of mass $1000 M_{\odot}$
are seeded inside halos when they reach a mass of $10^7 M_{\odot}$. The black
holes grow by accretion of gas from their surroundings and by merger with other
black holes, and consequently eject feedback energy. We analyze the simulation
output in post-processing to study the growth of the first IMBHs, and their
impact on star-formation. Our conclusions, based on numerical simulation
results, support the phenomenological ideas made by Silk (2017). IMBHs at the
centers of dwarf galaxies can be a strong source of feedback to quench

  Emission in Dwarf Galaxies","accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/sty3199",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Correlations between the radio continuum, infrared and CO emission are known
to exist for several types of galaxies and across several orders of magnitude.
However, the low-mass, low-luminosity and low-metallicity regime of these
correlations is not well known. A sample of metal-rich and metal-poor dwarf
galaxies from the literature has been assembled to explore this extreme regime.
The results demonstrate that the properties of dwarf galaxies are not simple
extensions of those of more massive galaxies; the different correlations
reflect different star-forming conditions and different coupling between the
star formation and the various quantities. It is found that dwarfs show
increasingly weaker CO and infrared emission for their luminosity, as expected
for galaxies with a low dust content, slower reaction rates, and a hard
ionizing radiation field. In the higher-luminosity dwarf regime (L_1.4GHz >
10^27 W, where L_1.4GHz ~ 10^29 W for a Milky Way star formation rate of ~1
M_sun yr^-1), the total and non-thermal radio continuum emission appear to
adequately trace the star formation rate. A breakdown of the dependence of the
(Halpha-based) thermal, non-thermal, and, hence, total radio continuum emission
on star formation rate occurs below L_1.4GHz ~ 10^27 W, resulting in a
steepening or downturn of the relations at extreme low luminosity. Below L_FIR
~ 10^36 W ~ 3 x 10^9 L_sun, the infrared emission ceases to adequately trace
the star formation rate. A lack of a correlation between the magnetic field
strength and the star formation rate in low star formation rate dwarfs suggests
a breakdown of the equipartition assumption. As extremely metal-poor dwarfs
mostly populate the low star formation rate and low luminosity regime, they
stand out in their infrared, radio continuum and CO properties.

strong Mn and P lines. HR 62 therefore resembles both a HgMn star (CP3) and a
He-weak PGa star (CP4).
  This study is a companion project to a high resolution survey of slowly
rotationg late-B type stars aiming at finding new chemically peculiar stars. We
have analysed the spectra of HR 62 (B8 III) and the dwarf comparison star HR
677 (B8 V) to derive their chemical abundances. Both stars have similar
effective temperatures (12500 K) and projected rotational velocities ($\sim$25
km s$^{-1}$).
  The medium resolution ($R$ $\sim$14000) spectra covering the wavelength range
of 4380-7350 \AA{} of HR 62 and HR 677 have been obtained with the \'{e}chelle
spectrograph attached to the 40 cm telescope in Ankara University Kreiken
Observatory (AUKR), Turkey. We have used SYNSPEC49/SYNPLOT written by I. Hubeny
and T. Lanz to compute grids of synthetic spectra and derive elemental
abundances by modeling selected unblended lines.
  We find that HR 62 exhibits underabundance of Si and remarkable overabundance
of P and Mn with respect to the Sun. In contrast, HR 677 does not have
abundances departing by more than $\pm$ 0.25 dex from solar abundances. A mass
of 5.4 $M_\odot$ and an age of 90 Myr have been estimated for HR 62.
  We discuss the origin of the chemical peculiarities of HR 62 and its status
as a CP star. The effective temperature of the star (12500 K) agrees well with
those of HgMn (CP3) stars. Furthermore, the main sequence end of its
evolutionary track also intersects the domain of He-weak CP4 stars. Hence these
first results suggest that HR 62 may be a transition object between the CP4 to
CP3 subgroup. However, a more detailed analysis of higher resolution spectra at
shorter wavelengths (< 4380 \AA{}) is necessary to clearly address the nature
of this interesting object.

by Karl Schwarzschild. Another highly relevant solution, representing a
rotating black hole, was found by Roy Kerr in 1963. It was only much after the

requires data taken over long time intervals. We combine radial velocity
measurements from five literature sources taken over the course of ~30 years to
yield the largest multi-epoch kinematic sample for stars in the dSphs Draco and
Ursa Minor. With this data set, we are able to implement an improved version of
the Bayesian technique described in Spencer et al. (2017b) to evaluate the
binary fraction of red giant stars in these dwarf galaxies. Assuming Duquennoy
& Mayor (1991) period and mass ratio distributions, the binary fractions in
Draco and Ursa Minor are $0.50^{+0.04}_{-0.06}$ and $0.78^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$,
respectively. We find that a normal mass ratio distribution is preferred over a
flat distribution, and that log-normal period distributions centered on long
periods ($\mu_{\log P}>3.5$) are preferred over distributions centered on short
ones. We reanalyzed the binary fractions in Leo II, Carina, Fornax, Sculptor,
and Sextans, and find that there is <1% chance that binary fraction is a
constant quantity across all seven dwarfs, unless the period distribution
varies greatly. This indicates that the binary populations in Milky Way dSphs
are not identical in regard to their binary fractions, period distributions, or
both. We consider many different properties of the dwarfs (e.g. mass, radius,
luminosity, etc.) and find that binary fraction might be larger in dwarfs that
formed their stars quickly and/or have high velocity dispersions.

high-dimensional normal density. The main setting considered is a fixed number
of vector following a high-dimensional normal distribution with unknown mean
and diagonal covariance matrix. The diagonal covariance matrix can be known or
unknown. If the covariance matrix is unknown, the sample size can be as small
as $2$. The proposed estimator is based on the idea that the unobserved pairs
of mean and variance for each dimension are drawn from an unknown bivariate
distribution, which we model as a mixture of normal-inverse gammas. The mixture
of normal-inverse gamma distributions provides advantages over more traditional
empirical Bayes methods, which are based on a normal-normal model. When fitting
a mixture model, we are essentially clustering the unobserved mean and variance
pairs for each dimension into different groups, with each group having a
different normal-inverse gamma distribution. The proposed estimator of each
mean is the posterior mean of shrinkage estimates, each of which shrinks a
sample mean towards a different component of the mixture distribution.
Similarly, the proposed estimator of variance has an analogous interpretation
in terms of sample variances and components of the mixture distribution. If
diagonal covariance matrix is known, then the sample size can be as small as
$1$, and we treat the pairs of known variance and unknown mean for each
dimension as random observations coming from a flexible mixture of
normal-inverse gamma distributions.

ring of NGC 6534 and partly by shocks -- in MCG 11-22-015. The oxygen
abundances in the HII regions of the rings are close to solar. We estimate the
star formation rates (SFR) in the two outer rings of the galaxies by using
several SFR indicators derived from narrow-band photometry in the H-alpha
emission line and archival GALEX ultraviolet images of the galaxies. The
derived SFRs allow to qualitatively restore star formation histories (SFH) in
the rings: in NGC 6534 the SFH is flat during the last 100-200 Myr, and in MCG
11-22-015 the star formation has started only a few Myr ago. We suggest that
the rings in NGC 6534 and MCG 11-22-015 have different natures: the former is a
resonant one supplied with gas perhaps through tidal effects, and the latter
has been produced by a satellite accretion. Recent outer gas accretion is
implied in both cases.

Sobolev spaces with a little higher regularity, $H^{1+\alpha}$. We rescaled

  for problems of large-deformation incompressible elasticity","Extensive revisions",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The immersed boundary method is a mathematical framework for modeling
fluid-structure interaction. This formulation describes the momentum,
viscosity, and incompressibility of the fluid-structure system in Eulerian
form, and it uses Lagrangian coordinates to describe the structural
deformations, stresses, and resultant forces. Integral transforms with Dirac
delta function kernels connect the Eulerian and Lagrangian frames. The fluid
and the structure are both typically treated as incompressible materials. Upon
discretization, however, the incompressibility of the structure is only
maintained approximately. To obtain an immersed method for incompressible
hyperelastic structures that is robust under large structural deformations, we
introduce a volumetric energy in the solid region that stabilizes the
formulation and improves the accuracy of the numerical scheme. This formulation
augments the discrete Lagrange multiplier for the incompressibility constraint,
thereby improving the original method's accuracy. This volumetric energy is
incorporated by decomposing the strain energy into isochoric and dilatational
components, as in standard solid mechanics formulations of nearly
incompressible elasticity. We study the performance of the stabilized method
using several quasi-static solid mechanics benchmarks, a dynamic
fluid-structure interaction benchmark, and a detailed three-dimensional model
of esophageal transport. The accuracy achieved by the stabilized immersed
formulation is comparable to that of a stabilized finite element method for
incompressible elasticity using similar numbers of structural degrees of
freedom.

theories compatible with the existence of a minimal (quantum gravity) length

by semisimple Lie algebras of coordinates. The other is characterized by
solvable Lie algebras. The explicit construction of corresponding Weyl-like
star products is given. We then focus on two specific examples of quantum space
and study the quantum properties of various models of scalar field theory with
quartic interactions built on them. The corresponding 2-point and 4-point
functions are computed at one-loop and the UV/IR mixing is discussed. The first
quantum spacetime considered is known as $\mathbb{R}^3_\theta$ which is a
deformation of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ noncommutativity. In this
case, the one-loop 2-point function is found to be finite with the deformation
parameter playing the role of a cutoff. The second quantum space is known as
$\kappa$-Minkowski. In this case, the action functional is required
$\kappa$-Poincar\'e invariant and various kinetic operators are considered. In
one case, we find that the one-loop 2-point function has milder UV divergence
than in the commutative case and that the one-loop 4-point function is finite.
The renormalization properties are discussed. Besides, the loss of cyclicity of
the Lebesgue integral (which results from the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e invariance of
the action functional) is interpreted as reflecting the occurrence of KMS
condition at the level of the algebra of fields modelling $\kappa$-Minkowski.
This interpretation sheds new light on $\kappa$-deformation-based quantum

While these representations are widely used in computer vision, their
prevalence in reinforcement learning is limited to sparse coding where
extracting representations for new data can be computationally intensive. Here,
we begin by demonstrating that learning a control policy incrementally with a
representation from a standard neural network fails in classic control domains,
whereas learning with a representation obtained from a neural network that has
sparsity properties enforced is effective. We provide evidence that the reason
for this is that the sparse representation provides locality, and so avoids
catastrophic interference, and particularly keeps consistent, stable values for
bootstrapping. We then discuss how to learn such sparse representations. We
explore the idea of Distributional Regularizers, where the activation of hidden
nodes is encouraged to match a particular distribution that results in sparse
activation across time. We identify a simple but effective way to obtain sparse
representations, not afforded by previously proposed strategies, making it more
practical for further investigation into sparse representations for

factors can lead to single emitters exhibiting ""blinking"", whereby the
fluorescence level switches between on and off states. Detailed
characterisation of this blinking behaviour including determining the switching
rates is often a powerful way to gain understanding about the underlying

bright emitters with low background noise, such approaches become difficult for
emitters fluorescing at low levels, high noise, or switching at fast rates. We
develop a Bayesian approach capable of inferring switching rates directly from
the time-series. This is able to deal with high levels of noise and fast
switching in fluorescence traces. Moreover, the Bayesian inference also yields
a robust picture of the parameter uncertainties, providing a benefit also for
bright emitters in low-noise settings. The technique can be adapted to identify

our method is applicable to a broad range of systems that show behaviour

exploration on a subset of variable states, and allows for reduced exploration

evolution of massive stars. Complete mixing over a certain distance beyond the
convective boundary (Stothers \& Chin 1985) and an exponentially decaying
diffusion outside the convection zone (Herwig 2000) are commonly adopted for
the overshoot mixing. Recently, Li (2012, 2017) developed the $k$-$\omega$
model, which can be used in both convection zones and overshooting regions. We
incorporated it in calculations of $30M_{\odot}$ stellar models. We find that
in the main sequence stage, models with the $k$-$\omega$ model are almost
identical to models with complete mixing in the overshooting region beyond the
convective core, and the overshooting in the $k$-$\omega$ model is equivalent
to an overshooting distance of about $0.15H_P$. In the post main sequence
stage, we find that the overshooting below the bottom of the intermediate
convection zone beyond the hydrogen-burning shell can significantly restrict
the size of the hydrogen-depleted core, and can penetrate effectively into the

core helium burning stage. During the core helium burning stage, we find that
the overshooting model based on the $k$-$\omega$ model results in a similar
complete mixing region but a much wider partial mixing region than the
overshooting model based on Herwig (2000). In particular, the overshooting
distance in the core helium burning stage may be significantly smaller than
that in the main sequence phase for massive stars.

detection, such as car, pedestrian and cyclist, especially when they are far
away from the camera and their sizes are small. Great advances have been made
for the deep networks, but small objects detection is still a challenging task.
In order to solve this problem, majority of existing methods utilize
complicated network or bigger image size, which generally leads to higher
computation cost. The proposed network model is referred to as modular feature
fusion detector (MFFD), using a fast and efficient network architecture for
detecting small objects. The contribution lies in the following aspects: 1) Two
base modules have been designed for efficient computation: Front module reduce
the information loss from raw input images; Tinier module decrease model size
and computation cost, while ensuring the detection accuracy. 2) By stacking the
base modules, we design a context features fusion framework for multi-scale
object detection. 3) The propose method is efficient in terms of model size and
computation cost, which is applicable for resource limited devices, such as
embedded systems for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Comparisons
with the state-of-the-arts on the challenging KITTI dataset reveal the
superiority of the proposed method. Especially, 100 fps can be achieved on the
embedded GPUs such as Jetson TX2.

that using the same blowing amplitude, harmonic VGJs were more effective and
efficient in reducing the separated region than the steady VGJs considering the
fact that the harmonic VGJs use less momentum than the steady case. For steady
VGJs, longitudinal structures formed immediately downstream of injection
location led to formation of hairpin-type vortices causing an earlier
transition to turbulence. Symmetric hairpin vortices were shown to develop
downstream of the forcing location for the harmonic VGJs as well. However, the
increased control effectiveness for harmonic VGJs flow control strategy is
attributed to the fact that shear-layer instability mechanism was exploited. As
a result, disturbances introduced by VGJs were strongly amplified leading to
development of large-scale coherent structures, which are very effective in
increasing the momentum exchange, thus, limiting the separated region.

infers the difference between an estimated and the true dynamics. In contrast
to other approaches, we can guarantee that the tracking error is stochastically

tracking error is asymptotically stable in the large. In simulation and with an

represented by an ordering vector ${q}_{1}$=$(0.2, 0.3, 0)$ and its cyclic
permutation. Upon heating, an additional magnetic peak splitting with
hysteresis was uncovered at around $T^*_{\rm N}{\sim}$2.5~K, indicating the
presence of a first-order commensurate-incommensurate transition with
${q}^*_{1}$=$(0.2, 0.3, {\delta})$ (${\delta}_{\rm max}{\simeq}$0.04) at
$T^*_{\rm N}$. A half-polarized neutron scattering experiment for polarization
parallel to the scattering vector revealed that polarization antiparallel to
the scattering vector has stronger intensity in both magnetic phases. This
feature clarifies the single chiral character of the helical structure with
moments lying perpendicular to the ordering vector in both ordered states.
Under a vertical magnetic field of 1.2~T for ${B}{\parallel}$[1,1,1] at 1.9~K
entering into the so-called $A$ phase, magnetic peaks form characteristic
hexagonal patterns in the equatorial scattering plane around nuclear peaks. An
ordering vector ${q}_{A}{\simeq}({\pm}0.09, {\pm}0.20, {\mp}0.28)$ of the
$A$-phase has similar periodic length as $q_{1}$, and could be the hallmark of
a formation of skyrmion lattice in EuPtSi.

smooth viewing experiences under unstable network conditions. However, most of
the existing rate adaptation approaches for ABR are content-agnostic, without
considering the semantic information of the video content. Nevertheless,
semantic information largely determines the informativeness and interestingness
of the video content, and consequently affects the QoE for video streaming. One
common case is that the user may expect higher quality for the parts of video
content that are more interesting or informative so as to reduce video
distortion and information loss, given that the overall bitrate budgets are
limited. This creates two main challenges for such a problem: First, how to
determine which parts of the video content are more interesting? Second, how to
allocate bitrate budgets for different parts of the video content with
different significances? To address these challenges, we propose a
Content-of-Interest (CoI) based rate adaptation scheme for ABR. We first design
a deep learning approach for recognizing the interestingness of the video
content, and then design a Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach for rate adaptation by
incorporating video interestingness information. The experimental results show
that our method can recognize video interestingness precisely, and the bitrate
allocation for ABR can be aligned with the interestingness of video content

train a single-shot convolutional neural network (CNN) that produces multiple
visual and geometric cues of interest: 2D bounding boxes, 2D keypoints of
interest, coarse object orientations and object dimensions. Subsets of these
cues are then used to poll probable ground planes from a pre-computed database
of ground planes, to identify the ""best fit"" plane with highest consensus. Once
identified, the ""best fit"" plane provides enough constraints to successfully
construct the desired 3D detection box, without directly predicting the 6DoF
pose of the object. The entire ground plane polling (GPP) procedure is
constructed as a non-parametrized layer of the CNN that outputs the desired

final 3D bounding box. Doing so allows us to poll thousands of different ground
plane configurations without adding considerable overhead, while also creating
a single CNN that directly produces the desired output without the need for
post processing. We evaluate our method on the 2D detection and orientation

system of multiple throughput-scalable blockchains with sharded consensus.
Specifically, the protocol design of sharded consensus not only enables
parallelizing the process of transaction validation with sub-groups of
processors, but also introduces the Byzantine consensus protocols for
accelerating the consensus processes. By allowing different blockchains to
impose different levels of processing fees and to have different

accordance with log-normal distributions, providing a constant mean length with
different widths of distribution. Scaling analysis was performed to obtain the
percolation thresholds in the thermodynamic limits for all values of the

evaporation, particularly its endpoint. In this paper I present a rather
complete toy model for the evolution of the geometry and the effective
stress-energy tensor derived from the geometry via the classical Einstein
equations. Modifications of the Schwarzschild geometry once the formation of
the black hole is complete are very small outside regions of high curvature,
and the curvature never becomes super-Planckian. The evolution of the white
hole is roughlythe time reverse of the formation and evaporation of the black
hole. The mass of the white hole increases as it gradually emits the negative
energy that flowed into the black hole during its evaporation until the matter
and radiaton that collapsed to form the black hole emerges and the white hole
disappears. I consider the compatibility of the model with some of the quantum
energy condition proposed in the literature, and the implications for the

studied numerically by a volume-of-fluid (VOF) method with two marker

was found based on the energy budget analysis. This can be explained by the
prolonged entanglement time and the enhanced internal-flow-induced viscous
dissipation for bouncing droplets at intermediate impact parameters, compared
with those at smaller or larger impact parameters. The universality of this
non-monotonicity was numerically verified, and thereby an approximate fitting
formula was proposed to correlate the kinetic energy dissipation factor with
the impact parameter for various Weber numbers and Ohnesorge numbers. From the
vortex dynamics perspective, a helicity analysis of droplet internal flow
identifies a strong three-dimensional interaction between the ""ring-shaped""
vortices and the ""line-shaped"" shear layers for off-center collisions.
Furthermore, we demonstrated theoretically and verified numerically that the
equivalence between the total enstrophy and the total viscous dissipation,
which holds for a single-phase flow system confined by stationary boundaries,
is not generally satisfied for the two-phase flow system containing gas-liquid

positions of three asteroids are measured with respect to the stars in Gaia DR2

declination are -0.090$^{''}$ and -0.623$^{''}$ based on the ephemeris of
published JPL, but the mean (O-C) are 3.122$^{''}$ and -0.636$^{''}$ based on
the ephemeris of published IMCCE. The great difference in declination could be
explained by several factors. (1)The degenerated CCD images caused by the high
apparent motion speed of the object leads to the reduction of positioning
accuracy. (2)The poor timing system may bring the system error, especially in
the high speed direction. (3)The asteroid may be perturbed by the earth when it
approaches the earth too closely. The astrometric results show that the
centroid centring method can reduce the dispersion of the non-Gaussian images
compared with the PSF model method. For Camillo and Midas, the astrometric
results are consistent based on two ephemerides. High-precision timing system,

this way, the cost and trouble of installing many measurement devices over

installed. The problem has been well-known since Hart's seminal paper in 1992,
and recently significant performance improvements have been achieved by
adopting deep networks. In this work, we focus on the idea that appliances have
on/off states, and develop a deep network for further performance improvements.
Specifically, we propose a subtask gated network that combines the main
regression network with an on/off classification subtask network. Unlike
typical multitask learning algorithms where multiple tasks simply share the
network parameters to take advantage of the relevance among tasks, the subtask
gated network multiply the main network's regression output with the subtask's
classification probability. When standby-power is additionally learned, the
proposed solution surpasses the state-of-the-art performance for most of the
benchmark cases. The subtask gated network can be very effective for any

augmentation is due to the enhancement of fluctuations by wakes behind

increased dissipation due to the particle drag. In order to examine the
turbulence attenuation mechanism, Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a
particle-gas suspension are carried out at a Reynolds number of about 3333
based on the average gas velocity $\bar{u}$, channel width $h$, and the gas
kinematic viscosity. The particle Reynolds number based on the particle
diameter $d_p$, gas kinematic viscosity and the flow velocity $\bar{u}$ is
about 42 and the Stokes number is in the range $7-450$. The particle volume
fraction is in the range $0-2 \times 10^{-3}$, and the particle mass loading is
in the range $0-9$. As the volume fraction is increased, a discontinuous
decrease in the turbulent velocity fluctuations is observed at a critical
volume fraction. from $9 \times 10^{-4}$ to $1 \times 10^{-3}$. There is a
reduction, by one order of magnitude, in the mean square fluctuating velocities
in all directions and in the Reynolds stress. Though there is a modest increase
in the energy dissipation due to particle drag, this increase is smaller than
the decrease in the turbulent energy production; moreover, there is a decrease
in the total energy dissipation rate when there is turbulence collapse. Thus,
turbulence attenuation appears to be due to a disruption of the turbulence
production mechanism, and not due to the increased dissipation due to the
particles. There is a discontinuous collapse in the turbulence intensities at a
critical particle loading, instead of the continuous decrease as the particle
loading is increased.

configurations (loops). In the short-wavelength limit MFP tends to a constant
value for any configuration. Oscillatory behavior is observed for all GBs which
indicates that they serve as diffraction grating for phonons. This property is
also inherent in GBs with irregularities caused by partial disclination

us to consider solution dependent source terms. Well-posedness of the model as
well as existence of strong solutions will be established for a broad class of
potentials. We will show that in the singular limit of vanishing viscosity we
recover a Darcy-type system related to Cahn-Hilliard-Darcy type models for
tumour growth which have been studied earlier. An asymptotic limit will show
that the results are also valid in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions

across different datasets, which severely limits the universality of the
detectors. To improve the adaptivity of the detectors, in this paper, we
present a novel dimension-decomposition region proposal network (DeRPN) that
can perfectly displace the traditional Region Proposal Network (RPN). DeRPN
utilizes an anchor string mechanism to independently match object widths and
heights, which is conducive to treating variant object shapes. In addition, a
novel scale-sensitive loss is designed to address the imbalanced loss
computations of different scaled objects, which can avoid the small objects
being overwhelmed by larger ones. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both
general object detection datasets (Pascal VOC 2007, 2012 and MS COCO) and scene
text detection datasets (ICDAR 2013 and COCO-Text) all prove that our DeRPN can
significantly outperform RPN. It is worth mentioning that the proposed DeRPN
can be employed directly on different models, tasks, and datasets without any
modifications of hyperparameters or specialized optimization, which further
demonstrates its adaptivity. The code will be released at

sufficient conditions for $\Psi(\theta_n)$ to decrease at a geometric rate:
$\Psi$ should decrease ""exponentially"" along the solution to the mean ODE, and
the deviation between the stochastic algorithm and the ODE solution (measured

provide practical conditions under which the two sufficient conditions may be

this paper we provide a framework for solving robust recoverable 0-1

several lower bounds and approximate solutions, which can be used for a wide

evaluate the influence of the resonance frequency. In this experiment, 13
participants executed a hammering task in direct manipulation using flexible
hammers in four conditions with resonance frequencies of 3.0 Hz to 9.9 Hz and

with visual and force feedback, without visual feedback, without force
feedback, and with a communication delay of 40 ms. The results indicate that

have been more populous than globular clusters when they were born, low-mass

dynamically formed main-sequence binary stars and stable and unstable mass
transfer between them since open clusters collapse within the main-sequence
life-time of massive stars. These binaries, therefore, have little
eccentricities. The fraction of such binaries among all merging BBHs increases
as the cluster mass decrease due to the shorter relaxation time. In our
simulations, $4.0\times10^{-5}$ and $1.7\times10^{-5}$ BBHs per solar mass
merged within 10 Gyr for models A and B, respectively. These values correspond
to $\sim$ 20-50% of the number of mergers per solar mass originated from

of BBHs originated from open clusters is not negligible. The estimated mergers

candidates is the measure of veto power. We find tight bounds on these minimal
shares for voting rules that are popular in the literature and in real
elections. We order these rules according to majority power and veto power. The
instant-runoff voting has both the highest majority power and the highest veto
power and the plurality rule has the lowest. In general, the higher the
majority power of a voting rule is, the higher its veto power. The three
exceptions are: voting with proportional veto power, Black's rule, and Borda
rule, which have a relatively low level of majority power and a high level of
veto power and thus provide minority protection. Our results can shed light on
how voting rules provide different incentives for voter participation and
candidate nomination.

analysis of execution traces against formal specifications. Typically, the two
main activities in runtime verification efforts are the process of creating
monitors from specifications, and the algorithms for the evaluation of traces
against the generated monitors. Other activities involve the instrumentation of
the system to generate the trace and the communication between the system under
analysis and the monitor. Most of the applications in runtime verification have
been focused on the dynamic analysis of software, even though there are many
more potential applications to other computational devices and target systems.
In this paper we present a collection of challenges for runtime verification
extracted from concrete application domains, focusing on the difficulties that
must be overcome to tackle these specific challenges. The computational models
that characterize these domains require to devise new techniques beyond the

are with confidence ascribed to mergers of compact objects and collapse of
massive stars, respectively. A third, intermediate/soft class, remains
putative. Its existence was claimed based on univariate and bivariate analyses
of GRB observables modeled with Gaussian distributions. This, however, may not
be the appropriate approach, as it has been already shown that the univariate
distributions of durations are better described by mixtures of two skewed
components rather than three Gaussian ones.
  This paper investigates whether data in the duration--hardness ratio plane is
better modeled by mixtures of skewed bivariate distributions than by normal
ones. The archival data set of the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory/BATSE and
Fermi/GBM data from the most recent catalogue release are examined. The
preferred model is chosen based on two information criteria, Akaike ($AIC$) and
Bayesian ($BIC$). It is found that the best description is given by a
two-component mixture of skewed Student-$t$ distributions, which outperforms
any other model considered. This implies that the distribution of the studied
parameters is intrinsically skewed, introducing spurious Gaussian components,
and hence the third class is unlikely to be a real phenomenon. Its existence,
based on statistical inference, is therefore rejected as unnecessary to explain
the observations.

relevant to the interpretation of geophysical data in subduction zones. A
polycrystalline antigorite specimen was tested via forced-oscillations at small
strain amplitudes and seismic frequencies (mHZ--Hz). The shear modulus has a
temperature sensitivity, $\partial G/ \partial T$, averaging $-0.017$ GPa
K$^{-1}$. Increasing temperature above $500^\circ$C results in more intensive
shear attenuation ($Q_G^{-1}$) and associated modulus dispersion, with
$Q_G^{-1}$ increasing monotonically with increasing oscillation period and
temperature. This ""background"" relaxation is adequately captured by a Burgers
model for viscoelasticity and possibly results from intergranular mechanisms.
Attenuation is higher in antigorite ($\log_{10} Q_G^{-1} \approx -1.5$ at
$550^\circ$C and $0.01$ Hz than in olivine ($\log_{10} Q_G^{-1} \ll -2.0$ below

robust identification of antigorite from seismic models of attenuation only.

a generic, parameter-free, and reliable tool to accurately predict transitional
and turbulent flows through medical devices. Flows through medical devices are
characterized by moderate Reynolds numbers and typically involve different flow
regimes such as laminar, transitional, and turbulent flows. Previous studies
for the FDA benchmark nozzle model revealed limitations of Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes turbulence models when applied to more complex flow scenarios.
Recent works based on large-eddy simulation approaches indicate that these
limitations can be overcome but also highlight potential limitations due to a
high sensitivity with respect to numerical parameters. The novel methodology
presented in this work is based on two key ingredients. Firstly, we use
high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods for discretization in space yielding
a discretization approach that is robust, accurate, and generic. The inherent
dissipation properties of high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations
render this approach well-suited for transitional and turbulent flow
simulations. Secondly, a precursor simulation approach is applied in order to
correctly predict the inflow boundary condition for the whole range of laminar,
transitional, and turbulent flow regimes. This approach eliminates the need to
fit parameters of the numerical solution approach. We investigate the whole
range of Reynolds numbers as suggested by the FDA benchmark nozzle problem in
order to critically assess the predictive capabilities of the solver. The
results presented in this study are compared to experimental data obtained by
particle image velocimetry demonstrating that the approach is capable of
correctly predicting the flow for different flow regimes.

sorting, whereby specific proteins are concentrated and distilled into
submicrometric lipid vesicles in eukaryotic cells. To this purpose, we
formulate a model based on the coupling of spontaneous molecular aggregation
with vesicle nucleation. Its implications are studied by means of a
phenomenological theory describing the diffusion of molecules towards multiple
sorting centers that grow due to molecule absorption and are extracted when
they reach a sufficiently large size. The predictions of the theory are
compared with numerical simulations of a lattice-gas realization of the model
and with experimental observations. The efficiency of the distillation process
is found to be optimal for intermediate aggregation rates, where the density of
sorted molecules is minimal and the process obeys simple scaling laws.
Quantitative measures of endocytic sorting performed in primary endothelial
cells are compatible with the hypothesis that these optimal conditions are
realized in living cells.

significant deviations from the KF model, which systematically underestimates
the reconfinement scale. For the power-law atmospheres the disagreement
increases with the power index k, exceeding two orders of magnitude for k=1.5.
For the King model, strong deviations are found on the outskirts of the

reconfined inside the core, the reconfinement scale is increased only by the

chloride microcrystals, which are constantly present in water and are visible
in the optical microscope as a dispersed phase. With rapid freezing, free water
crystallizes, turning into ice with the inclusion of the dispersed phase. At
this stage, xenogenic air bubbles are released. When ice melts, multiple small
bubbles form from diffusely dissolved air. At the same time, the ice acquires a
characteristic cellular structure. Bubbles grow, merge and form variegated air
channels that contribute to the release of air into the melt water. The
dispersed phase during the freezing of water under the conditions of our

a part of this fraction was kneaded from the main volume of water in the form
of loose flakes. The loss of water of part of the microdispersed phase and most

estimating their intrinsic X-ray luminosities. We adopt two different
strategies for X-ray sources for which more or less than 20 photons were
detected. For the brighter sample we fit the spectra with absorbed isothermal
models. In order to limit uncertainties, for most of the fainter Cygnus OB2
members in this sample, we constrain the spectral parameters to characteristic
ranges defined from the brightest stars. For X-ray sources with $<$20 net
photons we adopt a conversion factor from detected photon flux to intrinsic
flux. This was defined, building on the results for the previous sample, as a
function of the 20% quantile of the detected photon energy distributions, which
we prove to also correlate well with extinction. We then use the X-ray
extinction from the spectral fits to constrain the ratio between optical and
X-ray extinction toward Cygnus OB2, finding it consistent with standard
""Galactic""' values, when properly accounting for systematics. Finally we
exploit the large number of sources to constrain the average coronal abundances
of several elements, through two different ensemble analyses of the X-ray
spectra of low-mass Cygnus OB2 members. We find the pattern of abundances to be
largely consistent with that derived for the young stellar coronae in the Orion

from small-scale energetic eddies to large-scale motions (LSMs) in TBL. Dilute
desert sand grains with median diameter of 203{\mu}m and bulk volume fraction
of O(10-5) are used as discrete phase. Improved phase separation and discrete
particle matching method are developed for two-phase velocity measurement. The
results presented here provide new information concerning the effect of
high-inertia particles with dilute concentration on wall-bounded turbulence,
especially at high Re. The presence of sand grains attenuate turbulence
fluctuation by suppressing small-scale sweep-ejection cycle in the near-wall
region, and this suppression effect intensifies as the particle concentration
increases. A critical layer (y/{\delta}=0.12 or y+=670) is found to partition
the streamwise evolution of both the local concentration and the streamwise
mean velocity of the sand grains into a spatial developing near-wall region and
a quasi-parallel outer region. In addition, at this layer a balance of the
strength and probability between the sweep and ejection events of sand grains
is reached. Such a critical layer might be a good indicator of the upper bound
of the particle saltation process, in which LSMs are believed to play a
significant role.

important outcome of feedback. The formation of such low-mass, but metal-rich
and compact, objects is a long-standing puzzle. Using a pair of high-resolution
N-body+gas simulations, we investigate the evolution of a gas-rich low-mass
galaxy on a highly radial orbit around a massive host galaxy. As the infalling
low-mass galaxy passes through the host's corona at supersonic speeds, its
diffuse gas outskirts are stripped by ram pressure, as expected. However, the
compactness increases rapidly because of bursty star formation in the gas
tidally driven to the centre. The metal-rich gas produced by supernovae and
stellar winds is confined by the ram pressure from the surrounding environment,
leading to subsequent generations of stars being more metal-rich. After the gas
is depleted, tidal interactions enhance the metallicity further via the
stripping of weakly bound, old, and metal-poor stars, while the size of the
satellite is changed only modestly. The outcome is a metal-rich cE that is
consistent with observations. These results argue that classical cEs are
neither the stripped remnants of much more massive galaxies nor the merger
remnants of normal dwarfs. We present observable predictions that can be used

six-species model, characterized by the formation of spirals inside coarsening
domains, to two different types of perturbations: changing the values of the
predation and reproduction rates as well as changing the interaction scheme.
For both protocols we monitor the time evolution of the system after the onset
of the perturbation through the measurement of dynamical correlation functions
and time-dependent densities of empty sites. In this way we gain insights into
the complex responses to different perturbations in a system where spirals,
which are due to the formation of cyclic alliances, dominate the dynamics

mid-infrared to search for the presence of bow shocks around these objects.
Telescopes operating in the mid-infrared, such as the Spitzer Space Telescope
or Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), are potent tools for searching
for the stellar bow shocks. We used the available archival data from these
telescopes to search for bow shock candidates around the confirmed and
candidate HMXBs in the Galaxy. We detected extended mid-infrared structures
around several surveyed confirmed and candidate HMXBs. Two of these structures,
associated with Vela X-1 and 4U 1907+09, are genuine bow shocks that have been
studied previously. However, there are no new unambiguous bow shocks among the
rest of the objects. The paucity of bow shocks around HMXBs suggests that the
majority of these systems still reside within hot, low-density bubbles around
their parent star clusters or associations. This also implies that the
dynamical ejection of massive binaries is apparently less efficient than the
ejections caused by the supernova explosions inside a binary.

fireclay, each with firing temperatures from 550 {\deg}C to 950 {\deg}C. We
investigated the conductivity of standardized clay samples when immersed in a
0.9% sodium chloride solution with time-resolved four-point impedance
measurements. To test the reusability of the clay model, these measurements
were repeated after cleaning the samples by rinsing in deionized water for 5 h.
We found time-dependent impedance changes for approximately 5 min after
immersion in the solution. Thereafter, the conductivities stabilized between
0.0716 S/m and 0.0224 S/m depending on clay type and firing temperatures. The
reproducibility of the measurement results proved the effectiveness of the

In our approach, we integrate three key pillars of drug sensitivity, namely,
the molecular structure of compounds, transcriptomic profiles of cancer cells
as well as prior knowledge about interactions among proteins within cells. Our
models ingest a drug-cell pair consisting of SMILES encoding of a compound and
the gene expression profile of a cancer cell and predicts an IC50 sensitivity
value. Gene expression profiles are encoded using an attention-based encoding
mechanism that assigns high weights to the most informative genes. We present
and study three encoders for SMILES string of compounds: 1) bidirectional
recurrent 2) convolutional 3) attention-based encoders. We compare our devised
models against a baseline model that ingests engineered fingerprints to
represent the molecular structure. We demonstrate that using our
attention-based encoders, we can surpass the baseline model. The use of
attention-based encoders enhance interpretability and enable us to identify
genes, bonds and atoms that were used by the network to make a prediction.

set can be partitioned into. Previous approximation schemes were
nonconstructive, i.e., they only approximated the arboricity as a value without
computing a corresponding forest partition. This is because they operate on the
related pseudoforest partitions or the dual problem of finding dense subgraphs.
  We propose an algorithm for converting a partition of $k$ pseudoforests into
a partition of $k+1$ forests in $O(mk\log k + m \log n)$ time with a data
structure by Brodal and Fagerberg that stores graphs of arboricity $k$. A
slightly better bound can be given when perfect hashing is used. When applied
to a pseudoforest partition obtained from Kowalik's approximation scheme, our
conversion implies a constructive $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with
runtime $O(m \log n \log \Gamma\, \epsilon^{-1})$ for every $\epsilon > 0$. For
fixed $\epsilon$, the runtime can be reduced to $O(m \log n)$.
  Our conversion also implies a near-exact algorithm that computes a partition
into at most $\Gamma+2$ forests in $O(m\log n \,\Gamma \log^* \Gamma)$ time. It
might also pave the way to faster exact arboricity algorithms.
  We also make several remarks on approximation algorithms for the
pseudoarboricity and the equivalent graph orientations with smallest maximum
indegree, and correct some mistakes made in the literature.

practical importance in structural health monitoring due to its non-dispersive
characteristics. However, compared with Lamb wave, SH0 wave is less used in
practice since it is difficult to be excited by using conventional
piezoelectric transducers. Recently, face-shear piezoelectric mode has been
realized in PZT ceramics and several face-shear piezoelectric transducers have
been developed to excite pure SH0 wave in plates. However, when controllable
radiation pattern of SH0 wave is required, it is found that no mathematical
basis is available for designers to optimize the transducer's parameters. In
this work, based on the reciprocal theorem of elastodynamics and Huygens'
principle, a theoretical model is proposed to describe the SH0 wave field
generated by arbitrary-shaped face-shear transducers bonded on an infinite
isotropic plate. It is proved that the wave field generated by a face-shear
transducer is equivalent to that generated by uniform in-plane tractions along
its perimeter. Then the proposed model is applied to two specific cases of a
single square face-shear (d24) PZT wafer and a bidirectional SH0 wave
piezoelectric transducer(BSH-PT).Explicit analytical expressions for both cases
are successfully obtained. The accuracy of the obtained analytical model is
verified by both experiments and FEM simulations. Furthermore, some general
guidelines based on the analytical model are presented for optimization of the
transducer's dimensions. Finally, based on the guidelines, a new bidirectional
SH0 wave piezoelectric transducer is proposed with very small beam divergence.

coolant, and as a diagnostic molecule. However, a proper evaluation of the
cooling rate due to CO requires a determination of the populations of many
levels, the spontaneous and stimulated radiative de-excitation rates between
these levels, and the transfer of the emitted multi-line radiation;
additionally, this must be done for three isotopologues. It would be useful to
have a simple analytic formulation that avoided these complications; this could
then be used in situations where CO plays an important role as a coolant, but
the details of this role are not the main concern. We derive such a formulation
here, by first considering the two asymptotic forms that obtain in the limits
of (a) low volume-density and optical depth, and (b) high volume-density and
optical depth. These forms are then combined in such a way as to fit the
detailed numerical results from Goldsmith \& Langer (1978), which cover low
temperatures, and a range of physical conditions where the interplay of thermal
and sub-thermal excitation, optical-depth effects, and the contributions from
rare isotopologues, are all important. The fit is obtained using the
Metropolis-Hastings method, and reproduces the results of GL78 well. It is a
purely local and analytic function of state --- specifically a function of the
density, $\rho$, isothermal sound speed, $a$, CO abundance, $X_{_{\rm CO}}$,
and velocity divergence, $\nabla\cdot{\boldsymbol\upsilon}$. As an application,
we consider the cooling layer following a slow steady non-magnetic planar
J-shock. We show that, if the post-shock cooling is dominated by CO and its
isotopologues, the thickness of the post-shock cooling layer is very small and
approximately independent of the pre-shock velocity, $\upsilon_o$, or pre-shock
isothermal sound speed, $a_o$.

the former case of a fully repulsive binary BEC the phase separation of the
vortex-lattices is accompanied by a complete phase separation of component
densities. In the latter case of inter-species attraction there is a partial
phase separation of component densities, although there could be a complete
phase separation of the generated vortex lattices in the two components. In the
case of inter-species attraction, we need to have different intra-species

interconnecting of multiple chips/dies/tiers. Initially, we review prior art
and their limitations. We also put forward a novel, practical threat model of
IP piracy which is in line with the business models of present-day design

combine SM and LC. We propose a security-driven CAD and manufacturing flow for
face-to-face (F2F) 3D ICs, along with obfuscation of interconnects. Based on
this CAD flow, we conduct comprehensive experiments on DRC-clean layouts.
Strengthened by an extensive security analysis (also based on a novel attack to

unknown environment. We consider treasure hunt in geometric terrains with
obstacles. Both the terrain and the obstacles are modeled as polygons and both
the agent and the treasure are modeled as points. The agent navigates in the
terrain, avoiding obstacles, and finds the treasure when there is a segment of
length at most 1 between them, unobstructed by the boundary of the terrain or
by the obstacles. The cost of finding the treasure is the length of the
trajectory of the agent. We investigate the amount of information that the
agent needs a priori in order to find the treasure at cost $O(L)$, where $L$ is
the length of the shortest path in the terrain from the initial position of the
agent to the treasure, avoiding obstacles. Following the paradigm of algorithms
with advice, this information is given to the agent in advance as a binary
string, by an oracle cooperating with the agent and knowing the whole
environment: the terrain, the position of the treasure and the initial position
of the agent. Advice complexity of treasure hunt is the minimum length of the
advice string (up to multiplicative constants) that enables the agent to find
the treasure at cost $O(L)$.
  We first consider treasure hunt in regular terrains which are defined as
convex polygons with convex $c$-fat obstacles, for some constant $c>1$. A
polygon is $c$-fat if the ratio of the radius of the smallest disc containing
it to the radius of the largest disc contained in it is at most $c$. For the
class of regular terrains, we establish the exact advice complexity of treasure
hunt. We then show that advice complexity of treasure hunt for the class of
arbitrary terrains (even for non-convex polygons without obstacles, and even
for those with only horizontal or vertical sides) is exponentially larger than
for regular terrains.

2-D modified hologram configuration using parabolic surface reflector to
collimate the non-forward leaky modes into the forward leaky modes. The
modified hologram presents null-free radiation pattern and highly improved
operating frequency bandwidth. The consequent frequency bandwidth provides the
scannabality property by frequency variation. The forward mode-dominant surface
wave excitation of hologram lets the metasurface to generate the object beam
more precisely; therefore, high directivity all over the operating bandwidth is
obtained. The parabolic reflector lets the radiative surface of the metasurface

verified by fabrication and experimentally tested confirming the beam
maintenance over a reasonable frequency range and scannability property.

keys with security based on physical laws. Experimentally, it has been
implemented with optical means, achieving key rates of 1.26 Megabit/s over 50
kilometres (km) of standard optical fibre and 1.16 bit/hour over 404 km of
ultralow-loss fibre in a measurement-device-independent configuration.
Increasing the bit rate and range of QKD is a formidable, but important,
challenge. A related target, currently considered unfeasible without quantum
repeaters, is overcoming the fundamental rate-distance limit of point-to-point
QKD. Here we introduce a conceptually new scheme where pairs of
phase-randomised optical fields are first generated at two distant locations
and then combined at a central measuring station. The fields imparted with the
same random phase are ""twins"" and can be employed to distil a quantum key, as
we prove under an explicit security assumption. The key rate of this Twin-Field
QKD (TF-QKD) shows the same dependence on distance as a quantum repeater,
scaling with the square-root of the channel transmittance, irrespective of whom
is in control of the measuring station. Differently from a quantum repeater,
however, the new scheme is feasible with current technology and presents
manageable levels of noise even on 550 km of standard optical fibre. This is
promising to overcome the QKD rate-distance barrier and to greatly extend the
range of secure quantum communications.

between clouds. Such a collision will produce a shock-compressed layer, and a
star cluster can then condense out of the dense gas near the centre of the
layer. If the clouds are sufficiently massive, the star cluster is likely to
contain at least one massive star, which emits ionising radiation, and excites
an H{\sc ii} region, which then expands, sweeping up the surrounding neutral
gas. Once most of the matter in the clouds has accreted onto the layer,
expansion of the H{\sc ii} Region meets little resistance in directions
perpendicular to the mid-plane of the layer, and so it expands rapidly to
produce two lobes of ionised gas, one on each side of the layer. Conversely, in
directions parallel to the mid-plane of the layer, expansion of the H{\sc ii}
Region stalls due to the ram-pressure of the gas that continues to fall towards
the star cluster from the outer parts of the layer; a ring of dense neutral gas
builds up around the waist of the Bipolar H{\sc ii} Region, and may spawn a
second generation of star formation. In this paper we present a dimensionless
model for the flow of ionised gas in a Bipolar H{\sc ii} Region created
according to the above scenario, and predict the characteristics of the
resulting freefree continuum and recombination-line emission. This
dimensionless model can be scaled to the physical parameters of any particular
system. Our intention is that these predictions will be useful in testing the
scenario outlined above, and thereby providing indirect support for the role of
cloud/cloud collisions in triggering star formation.

spectrum. The excitation energy, emission energy and Stokes shift of its
luminescent centers are simulated through a constrained density-functional
theory method coupled with a ${\Delta}$SCF analysis of total energies, and
compared with experimental spectra. We show that the high-energy emission band
comes from a single Ce-based luminescent center, while the large experimental
spread of the low-energy emission band originates from a whole set of different
Ce-V$_O$ complexes together with the other Ce-based luminescent center.
Further, the luminescence thermal quenching behavior is analyzed. The $4f-5d$
crossover mechanism is found to be very unlikely, with a large crossing energy
barrier (E$_{fd}$) in the one-dimensional model. The alternative mechanism
usually considered, namely the electron auto-ionization, is also shown to be
unlikely. In this respect, we introduce a new methodology in which the
time-consuming accurate computation of the band gap for such models is
bypassed. We emphasize the usually overlooked role of the differing geometry
relaxation in the excited neutral electronic state Ce$^{3+,*}$ and in the
ionized electronic state Ce$^{4+}$. The results indicate that such electron
auto-ionization cannot explain the thermal stability difference between the
high- and low-energy emission bands. Finally, a hole auto-ionization process is
proposed as a plausible alternative. With the already well-established excited
state characterization methodology, the approach to color center identification
and thermal quenching analysis proposed here can be applied to other
luminescent materials in the presence of intrinsic defects.

Furthermore, a generalized Gaussian fit leads to simple estimators based on
order statistics that match the performance of more complicated maximum

estimators outperform both the sample mean and midrange for nontrivial sums of
Gaussian and uniform noise. Additional analysis of the generalized Gaussian

dither to quantized measurements. Specifically, we find subtractive dither to
be beneficial when the ratio between the Gaussian standard deviation and

industries and often requires machine learning driven solutions. Supervised
approaches, however, can be challenging, since it is often difficult to obtain
large amounts of labeled training data. In this work, we instead perform
one-class unsupervised learning on fault-free samples by training a deep
convolutional neural network to complete images whose center regions are cut
out. Since the network is trained exclusively on fault-free data, it completes
the image patches with a fault-free version of the missing image region. The
pixel-wise reconstruction error within the cut out region is an anomaly image
which can be used for anomaly detection. Results on surface images of decorated
plastic parts demonstrate that this approach is suitable for detection of
visible anomalies and moreover surpasses all other tested methods.

death. In many cases ganglion cells are spared making it possible to stimulate

shown that it is possible to express an optogenetic protein in ganglion cells

since optical targeting may be more precise than electrical stimulation with a
retinal prothesis. However the spatial resolution of
optogenetically-reactivated retinas has not been measured with fine-grained
stimulation patterns. Since the optogenetic protein is also expressed in axons,
it is unclear if these neurons will only be sensitive to the stimulation of a
small region covering their somas and dendrites, or if they will also respond
to any stimulation overlapping with their axon, dramatically impairing spatial
resolution. Here we recorded responses of mouse and macaque retinas to random
checkerboard patterns following an in vivo optogenetic therapy. We show that
optogenetically activated ganglion cells are each sensitive to a small region
of visual space. A simple model based on this small receptive field predicted
accurately their responses to complex stimuli. From this model, we simulated
how the entire population of light sensitive ganglion cells would respond to
letters of different sizes. We then estimated the maximal acuity expected by a
patient, assuming it could make an optimal use of the information delivered by

violation in low energy processes, has since emerged as an attractive framework
for light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. The scalar sector of the
minimal LRSM consists of an $SU(2)$ bi-doublet, as well as left- and
right-handed weak isospin triplets, thus making the corresponding vacuum
structure much more complicated than that of the Standard Model. In particular,
the desired ground state of the Higgs potential should be a charge conserving,
and preferably global, minimum with parity violation at low scales. We show
that this is not a generic feature of the LRSM potential and happens only for a
small fraction of the parameter space of the potential. We also analytically
study the potential for some simplified cases and obtain useful conditions
(though not necessary) to achieve successful symmetry breaking. We then carry
out a detailed statistical analysis of the minima of the Higgs potential using
numerical minimization and find that for a large fraction of the parameter
space, the potential does not have a good vacuum. Imposing the analytically
obtained conditions, we can readily find a small part of the parameter space
with good vacua. Consequences for some scalar masses are also discussed.

However, it is questionable whether it is correct to use the fixed and

introduce the active weighted mapping method which infers proper weight values
based on the characteristic of input data on the fly. The weight values of each
mapping unit are not fixed but changed as the input image is changed, and the
most proper weight values for each mapping unit are derived according to the
input image. For this purpose, channel-wise information is embedded from both
the shortcut connection and convolutional block, and then the fully connected

the backbone network and the proposed module alternately for a more stable

Earlier interferometric and polarimetric observations revealed strong
asymmetries both in the gap region and in the outer disc. The presence of a
companion was inferred to explain these asymmetric structures and the ongoing
disc clearing. Using an extensive set of multi-wavelength and multi-epoch
observations we aimed to identify the origin of the previously detected
asymmetries. We have observed V1247 Ori at three epochs spanning $\sim678$ days
using sparse aperture masking interferometry with Keck/NIRC2 and VLT/NACO. In
addition, we search for signs of accretion through VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL spectral
differential imaging in H$\alpha$ and R-band continuum. Our SMA sub-millimetre
interferometry in 880 $\mu$m continuum and in the CO(3-2) line allows us to
constrain the orientation and direction of rotation of the outer disc. We find
the L'-band emission to be dominated by static features which trace
forward-scattered dust emission from the inner edge of the outer disc located
to the north-east. In H- and K-band, we see evidence for a companion candidate
that moved systematically by 45$^{\circ}$ within the first $\sim$345 days. The
separation of the companion candidate is not well constrained, but the observed
position angle change is consistent with Keplerian motion of a body located on
a 6 au orbit. From the SMA CO moment map, the location of the disc rim, and the
detected orbital motion, we deduced the three-dimensional orientation of the
disc. We see no indication of accretion in H$\alpha$ and set upper limits for
an accreting companion. The measured contrast of the companion candidate in H
and K is consistent with an actively accreting protoplanet. Hence, we identify
V1247 Ori as a unique laboratory for studying companion-disc interactions and
disc clearing.

We report molecular dynamics simulations of a Lennard-Jones gas mimicking argon
under partial confinement for a wide range of densities at a temperature of 300
K. The isotropic behavior of velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) and mean
squared displacement (MSD), seen in the bulk, breaks down due to partial
confinement. A distinct trend emerges in the VACF-perpendicular and
MSD-perpendicular, corresponding to the confined direction, while the trends in
VACF-parallel and MSD-parallel, corresponding to the other two unconfined
directions are seen to be unaffected by the confinement. VACF-perpendicular
displays a minimum, at short timescales, that correlates with the separation
between the reflective walls. The effect of partial confinement on
MSD-perpendicular is seen to manifest as a transition from diffusive to
subdiffusive motion with the transition time correlating with the minimum in
the VACF-perpendicular. When compared to the trends shown by MSD and VACF in
the bulk, the MSD-perpendicular exhibits subdiffusive behavior and the
VACF-perpendicular features rapid decay, suggesting that confinement suppresses
the role of thermal fluctuations significantly. Repetitive wall-mediated
collisions are identified to give rise to the minima in VACF-perpendicular and
in turn a characteristic frequency in its frequency spectrum. The strong linear
relation between the minima in VACF-perpendicular and wall-spacing suggests the
existence of collective motion propagating at the speed of sound. These
numerical experiments can offer interesting possibilities in the study of
confined motion with observable consequences.

our main theorem showing that equivalence checking of two quantum Mealy
machines can be done with input sequences that are taken from some chosen basis

of higher-derivative harmonic oscillator with stable classical dynamics. A wide

nursing systems. However, due to the limitation in data sources and the
subjectiveness in pain intensity values, it is hard to adopt modern deep neural
networks for this problem without domain-specific auxiliary design. Inspired by
human vision priori, we propose a novel approach called saliency supervision,
where we directly regularize deep networks to focus on facial area that is
discriminative for pain regression. Through alternative training between
saliency supervision and global loss, our method can learn sparse and robust
features, which is proved helpful for pain intensity regression. We verified
saliency supervision with face-verification network backbone on the widely-used
dataset, and achieved state-of-art performance without bells and whistles. Our
saliency supervision is intuitive in spirit, yet effective in performance. We
believe such saliency supervision is essential in dealing with ill-posed
datasets, and has potential in a wide range of vision tasks.

gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) has been used in the turbulent flow simulations. At
the same time, high-order GKS has been developed, such as the two-stage
fourth-order scheme (S2O4) GKS, and used for laminar flow calculations. In this
paper, targeting on the high-Reynolds number engineering turbulent flows, an
implicit high-order GKS with Lower-Upper Symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS)
technique is developed under the S2O4 framework. Based on Vreman-type LES model
and $k - \omega$ SST model, a turbulent relaxation time is obtained and used
for an enlarged particle collision time in the implicit high-order GKS for the
high-Reynolds number turbulent flows. Numerical experiments include
incompressible decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence, incompressible
high-Reynolds number flat plate turbulent flow, incompressible turbulence
around NACA0012 airfoil, transonic turbulence around RAE2822 airfoil, and
transonic high-Reynolds number ARA M100 wing-body turbulence. Comparisons among
the numerical solutions from current implicit high-order GKS, the explicit
high-order GKS, the implicit second-order GKS, and experimental measurements
have been conducted. Through these examples, it is concluded that the
high-order GKS has high accuracy in space and time, especially for smooth
flows, obtaining more accurate turbulent flow fields on coarse grids compared
with second-order GKS. In addition, significant acceleration on computational
efficiency, as well as super robustness in simulating complex flows are
confirmed for current implicit high-order GKS. This study also indicates that
turbulence modeling plays a dominant role in the capturing physical solution,
such as in the transonic three-dimensional complex RANS simulation, in
comparison with numerical discretization errors.

requirements, we quantify the attacker capability in terms of the set of safety
requirements an attacker can compromise. Given a system (in the presence of an

the especially expensive and labor-intensive labeling, existing public corpora
in AT-level are all relatively small. Meanwhile, most of the previous methods
rely on complicated structures with given scarce data, which largely limits the
efficacy of the neural models. In this paper, we exploit a new direction named
coarse-to-fine task transfer, which aims to leverage knowledge learned from a
rich-resource source domain of the coarse-grained AC task, which is more easily
accessible, to improve the learning in a low-resource target domain of the
fine-grained AT task. To resolve both the aspect granularity inconsistency and
feature mismatch between domains, we propose a Multi-Granularity Alignment
Network (MGAN). In MGAN, a novel Coarse2Fine attention guided by an auxiliary
task can help the AC task modeling at the same fine-grained level with the AT
task. To alleviate the feature false alignment, a contrastive feature alignment
method is adopted to align aspect-specific feature representations
semantically. In addition, a large-scale multi-domain dataset for the AC task
is provided. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness

on perceived speech intelligibility, perceived listening effort and the general

and itself, through the Lagrangian density derivative terms. The spatial and
temporal dependence of h falls directly out of the field equations themselves.
Three solutions are found: a free field with a tadpole term; a standing-wave
non-propagating mode; a non-oscillating non-propagating mode. The first two are
quantizable, and the third is not. The third corresponds to a zero-momentum
classical field that naturally decays spatially to a constant with no ad-hoc
terms added to the Lagrangian. An attempt is made to calibrate the constants in
the third solution based on experimental data. The three fields are referred to
as actons. It is tentatively concluded that the acton origin coincides with a

  Mathematics",,,,"physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present a simple mathematical theory of carving turns in
alpine skiing and snowboarding. The theory captures the basic dynamics of
carving runs and thus provides a useful tool for assessing the potential and
limitations of the carving technique. We also apply the model to simulate runs
on slopes of constant gradient and describe the results. We find that pure
carving is possible only on relatively flat slopes, with the critical slope
angle in the range of 8-20 degrees. The exact value depends mostly on the
coefficient of snow friction and to a lesser degree on the sidecut radius of
the skis. In wiggly carving runs on slopes of subcritical gradient, the
aerodynamic drag force remains relatively unimportant and the speed stops
growing well below the one achieved in fall-line gliding. This is because the
increased g-force of carving turns leads to enhanced snow friction which can
significantly exceed the one found in the gliding. At the critical gradient,
the g-force of carving turns becomes excessive. For such and even steeper
slopes only hybrid turns, where at least some part of the turn is skidded, are
possible. The carving turns of all alpine racing disciplines are approximately
similar. This is because in the dimensionless equations of the model the
sidecut radius of skis enters only via the coefficient of the aerodynamic drag
term, which always remains relatively small. Simple modifications to the model
are made to probe the roles of skier angulation and skidding at the transition
phase of hybrid turns. As expected the angulation gives certain control over
the turn trajectory, but does not remove the slope limitations.

able to know whether their design business processes are feasible or not. In
order to solve this problem, we proposed a model called BPMNSemAuto that makes
use of the existing services stored in the service registry UDDI (Universal
Description Discovery and Integration). From the data extracted from the UDDI,
the WSDL files and the tracking data of service execution on the server, a Web
Service Ontology (WSOnto) is generated to store all the existing services. The
BPMNSemAuto model takes an input of business process design specifications, and
it generates an executable business process as an output. It provides an
interface for business analysts to specify the description of each service task
of the design business process. For each service task, the business analysts
specify the task objective (keywords), inputs, outputs and weights of the
Quality of Service (QoS) properties. From the design business process with the
service task specifications, a Business Process Ontology (BPOnto) is generated.
A service selection algorithm performs the mapping between the instances of the
WSOnto and the BPOnto to obtain possible mappings between these two ontologies.
The obtained mappings help the model to acquire web services to execute the
desired service tasks. Moreover, the consistency checking of the inputs of the
proposed model is performed before executing the service selection algorithm.
WordNet is used to solve the synonym problems and at the same time a keyword
extraction method is presented in this paper.

design aims to optimize the computation offloading to the cloud jointly with
the subchannel allocation to minimize the maximum (min-max) weighted energy
consumption subject to practical constraints on bandwidth, computing resource
and allowable latency for the multi-user multitask computation system. To
tackle this non-convex mixed integer non-linear problem (MINLP), we employ the
bisection search method to solve it where we propose a novel approach to
transform and verify the feasibility of the underlying problem in each
iteration. In addition, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, which can
decrease the number of binary optimization variables and enable more scalable
computation offloading optimization in the practical wireless HetNets.
Numerical studies confirm that the proposed design achieves the energy saving
gains about 55% in comparison with the local computation scheme under the
strict required latency of 0.1s.

  Forward System","presented at the ECMOR conference on 3.09.2018, Barcelona",,,,"physics.geo-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years researchers in oil-gas industry have established that the
contribution of memory is significant for the modeling of fluid flow in
unconventional reservoirs. Mathematically, a memory-based fluid flow model can
be described by the system of integro-differential equations. Despite the fact
that a large number of journal articles are devoted to numerical methods for
the forward solution of such equations, the problems of optimization and
optimal control of these systems are actual and insufficiently studied. We
consider the one-dimensional model of gas filtration and diffusion as a model
with memory. The system includes a partial differential equation for filtration
in fractures and weakly singular Volterra integral equation of the second kind,
which describes the diffusion of gas from blocks with closed nanopores.
Numerical simulation, obtained using a Navot-trapezoidal algorithm, shows that
the effect of memory influences on the distribution and the time evolution of
pressure and density in comparison with the classical double porosity model.
The pressure-constrained maximization of discounted cumulative gas production
was chosen as a basic optimization problem. The appearance of memory in the
model makes the standard adjoint-based approach not applicable since it was
developed only for conventional systems of partial differential equations. The
novel adjoint model for media with memory was obtained from the necessary
conditions of optimality using the classical theory of calculus of variations
and efficiently applied to production optimization problem. In conclusion we
compare optimal control scenarios for the model with memory and for the
classical double porosity model. Analysis has shown the importance of memory
accounting in reservoir optimization problems.
