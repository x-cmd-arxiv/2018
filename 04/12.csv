image. Motion-blurred images are the result of an averaging process, where
instant frames are accumulated over time during the exposure of the sensor.
Unfortunately, reversing this process is nontrivial. Firstly, averaging
destroys the temporal ordering of the frames. Secondly, the recovery of a
single frame is a blind deconvolution task, which is highly ill-posed. We
present a deep learning scheme that gradually reconstructs a temporal ordering
by sequentially extracting pairs of frames. Our main contribution is to
introduce loss functions invariant to the temporal order. This lets a neural
network choose during training what frame to output among the possible
combinations. We also address the ill-posedness of deblurring by designing a
network with a large receptive field and implemented via resampling to achieve
a higher computational efficiency. Our proposed method can successfully
retrieve sharp image sequences from a single motion blurred image and can
generalize well on synthetic and real datasets captured with different cameras.

is ascribed to the conformational dynamics of terminal ethylene groups of the

charge-transfer salts where, however, the anions form polymerlike chains, in
contrast to the spherical anions of the present material. Dielectric
spectroscopy reveals two additional relaxational processes. The characteristics
of the faster one are consistent with excitations of a one-dimensional Wigner
lattice as recently observed in this material by infrared spectroscopy, which
are also accompanied by conformational changes of the molecules. However, at
low temperature the ethylene-group relaxation exhibits the
cooperativity-induced dramatic slowing down that is typical for glassy
freezing, while the defect-related Wigner-lattice excitation follows thermally
activated behavior as expected for single-dipole relaxations.

the size of the hidden layers. This is commonly referred to as pooling, and is
applied to reduce the number of parameters, improve invariance to certain
distortions, and increase the receptive field size. Since pooling by nature is
a lossy process, it is crucial that each such layer maintains the portion of
the activations that is most important for the network's discriminability. Yet,
simple maximization or averaging over blocks, max or average pooling, or plain
downsampling in the form of strided convolutions are the standard. In this
paper, we aim to leverage recent results on image downscaling for the purposes
of deep learning. Inspired by the human visual system, which focuses on local
spatial changes, we propose detail-preserving pooling (DPP), an adaptive
pooling method that magnifies spatial changes and preserves important
structural detail. Importantly, its parameters can be learned jointly with the
rest of the network. We analyze some of its theoretical properties and show its
empirical benefits on several datasets and networks, where DPP consistently
outperforms previous pooling approaches.

complexity of the Maximum Independent Set problem on $P_t$-free graphs, that
is, on graphs not containing any induced path on $t$ vertices. So far,
polynomial-time algorithms are known only for $t\le 5$ [Lokshtanov et al., SODA

subexponential-time algorithms for the problem: we show that for any $t\ge 1$,
there is an algorithm for Maximum Independent Set on $P_t$-free graphs whose
running time is subexponential in the number of vertices. Even for the weighted
version MWIS, the problem is solvable in $2^{O(\sqrt {tn \log n})}$ time on
$P_t$-free graphs. For approximation of MIS in broom-free graphs, a similar
time bound is proved.
  Scattered Set is the generalization of Maximum Independent Set where the
vertices of the solution are required to be at distance at least $d$ from each
other. We give a complete characterization of those graphs $H$ for which
$d$-Scattered Set on $H$-free graphs can be solved in time subexponential in
the size of the input (that is, in the number of vertices plus the number of

graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges can be solved in time
$2^{O(|V(H)|\sqrt{n+m}\log (n+m))}$, even if $d$ is part of the input.

how median bias reduction in multinomial logistic regression can be done using
the equivalent Poisson log-linear model. The estimates coming out from mean and
median bias reduction are found to overcome practical issues related to
infinite estimates that can occur with positive probability in generalized
linear models with multinomial or discrete responses, and can result in valid
inferences even in the presence of a high-dimensional nuisance parameter

theoretical problem, especially because this new medium is widely exploited as
a platform for disinformation and propaganda. This paper introduces a novel
approach to influence estimation on social media networks and applies it to the
real-world problem of characterizing active influence operations on Twitter
during the 2017 French presidential elections. The new influence estimation
approach attributes impact by accounting for narrative propagation over the
network using a network causal inference framework applied to data arising from
graph sampling and filtering. This causal framework infers the difference in
outcome as a function of exposure, in contrast to existing approaches that
attribute impact to activity volume or topological features, which do not
explicitly measure nor necessarily indicate actual network influence.
Cram\'er-Rao estimation bounds are derived for parameter estimation as a step

identify the simplest causal structure which exhibits a separation between

Instrumental scenario, known from classical causal models. We derive
inequalities for this scenario and show that they are closely related to
well-known Bell inequalities, such as the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt

post-quantum bounds as well as strategies violating the first two. The
relations that we uncover imply that the quantum or post-quantum advantages
witnessed by the violation of our Instrumental inequalities are not
fundamentally different from those witnessed by the violations of standard
inequalities in the usual Bell scenario. However, non-classical tests in the
Instrumental scenario require fewer input choices than their Bell scenario
counterpart, which may have potential implications for device-independent
protocols.

our results are new even in the case of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 5$. In
particular, we prove that every tree in the forest has spectral dimension $4/3$
and walk dimension $3$ almost surely, and that the critical exponents governing
the intrinsic diameter and volume of the past of a vertex in the forest are $1$

the finite component that is disconnected from infinity when that vertex is
deleted from the forest.) We obtain as a corollary that the critical exponent
governing the extrinsic diameter of the past is $2$ on any transitive graph of
at least five dimensional polynomial growth, and is $1$ on any bounded degree

to be larger than stellar evolutionary models predict by as much as $10-15\%$.
A proposed explanation for this discrepancy involves effects from strong
magnetic fields, induced by rapid-rotation via the dynamo process. Although, a
handful of single, slowly-rotating M dwarfs with radius measurements from
interferometry also appear to be larger than models predict, suggesting that
rotation or binarity specifically may not be the sole cause of the discrepancy.
We test whether single, rapidly rotating, fully convective stars are also
larger than expected by measuring their $R \sin i$ distribution. We combine
photometric rotation periods from the literature with rotational broadening ($v
\sin i$) measurements reported in this work for a sample of 88 rapidly rotating
M dwarf stars. Using a Bayesian framework, we find that stellar evolutionary
models underestimate the radii by $10-15\% \substack{+3 \\ -2.5}$, but that at
higher masses ($0.18<M<0.4 M_{Sun}$) the discrepancy is only about $6\%$ and
comparable to results from interferometry and eclipsing binaries. At the lowest
masses ($0.08<M<0.18 M_{Sun}$), we find the discrepancy between observations
and theory is $13-18\%$, and we argue that the discrepancy is unlikely to be
due to effects from age. Furthermore, we find no statistically significant
radius discrepancy between our sample and the handful of M dwarfs with
interferometric radii. We conclude that neither rotation nor binarity is
responsible for the inflated radii of fully convective M dwarfs, and that all
fully-convective M dwarfs are larger than models predict.

find an observational turn-over of the torus emission in the $30-40$ $\mu$m
wavelength range with a characteristic temperature of $70-100$ K. This
component is clearly different from the diffuse extended emission in the narrow
line and star formation regions at 10-100 $\mu$m within the central 700 pc. We
compute $2.2-432$ $\mu$m 2D images using the best inferred \textsc{clumpy}
torus model based on several nuclear spectral energy distribution (SED)
coverages. We find that when $1-20$ $\mu$m SED is used, the inferred result
gives a small torus size ($<4$ pc radius) and a steep radial dust distribution.
The computed torus using the $1-432$ $\mu$m SED provides comparable torus
sizes, $5.1^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ pc radius, and morphology to the recently resolved
432 $\mu$m ALMA observations. This result indicates that the $1-20$ $\mu$m
wavelength range is not able to probe the full extent of the torus. The
characterization of the turn-over emission of the torus using the $30-60$
$\mu$m wavelength range is sensitive to the detection of cold dust in the
torus. The morphology of the dust emission in our 2D image at 432 $\mu$m is
spatially coincident with the cloud distribution, while the morphology of the
emission in the $1-20$ $\mu$m wavelength range shows an elongated morphology
perpendicular to the cloud distribution. We find that our 2D \textsc{clumpy}
torus image at 12 $\mu$m can produce comparable results to those observed using
IR interferometry.

magnitude in mass. It has been proposed that this characteristic scale is set
by some dynamical feedback mechanism preventing collapse beyond a certain
surface density. However, simple analytic models and detailed simulations of
star formation moderated by feedback from massive stars argue that feedback
becomes {\it less} efficient at higher surface densities (with the star
formation efficiency increasing as $\sim \Sigma/\Sigma_{crit}$). We therefore
propose an alternative model wherein stellar feedback becomes ineffective at
moderating star formation above some $\Sigma_{crit}$, so the supply of
star-forming gas is rapidly converted to stars before the system can contract
to higher surface density. We show that such a model -- with $\Sigma_{crit}$
taken directly from the theory -- naturally predicts the observed
$\Sigma_{max}$. $\Sigma_{max}\sim 100\Sigma_{crit}$ because the gas consumption
time is longer than the global freefall time even when feedback is ineffective.
Moreover the predicted $\Sigma_{max}$ is robust to spatial scale and
metallicity, and is preserved even if multiple episodes of star formation/gas
inflow occur. In this context, the observed $\Sigma_{max}$ directly tells us
where feedback fails.

stringent limits on whether multiple bursts of star-formation have taken place
within the cluster, as predicted by some models for the origin of multiple
populations. We carry out two distinct analyses to test whether multiple
star-formation epochs have occurred within NGC 1978. First, we use UV CMDs to
select stars from the first and second population along the SGB, and then
compare their positions in optical CMDs, where the morphology is dominantly
controlled by age as opposed to multiple population effects. We find that the
two populations are indistinguishable, with age differences of $1\pm20$ Myr
between them. This is in tension with predictions from the AGB scenario for the

in a metallic bilayer when the ratio between the Fermi velocities is small and
both metals have a similar, low carrier density. In this case, the slower

metal dichalcogenide (e.g. WSe$_2$). The superconducting transition temperature
that arises from the dynamically screened Coulomb repulsion is computed using

that $T_c$ can exceed 100 mK, and it increases further when the Dirac valley

in the background of a black hole corresponds to the acceleration of the

momentum-size correspondence as a tool to study scrambling in the field of a

non-trivial test of the momentum-size relation, as well as an explanation of a
paradoxical feature of scrambling previously discovered by Leichenauer
[arXiv:1405.7365 [hep-th]]. Naively Leichenauer's result says that only the
non-extremal entropy participates in scrambling. The same feature is also
present in the SYK model. In this paper we find a quite different
interpretation of Leichenauer's result which does not have to do with any
decoupling of the extremal degrees of freedom. Instead it has to do with the
buildup of momentum as a particle accelerates through the long throat of the
Reissner-Nordstrom geometry.

variations, with the two anomalous stars being enriched by ~0.2 dex. Due to our
small-size sample, this difference is at the ~2.5 sigma level; (ii) no evidence
for variations in the slow neutron-capture abundances over Fe, at odds with
what is often observed in anomalous Type II GCs, e.g. M 22 and Omega Centauri;
(iii) no large variations in light elements C, O and Na, compatible with the

are not expected. Since the analyzed stars are homogeneous in light elements,
the only way to reproduce the photometric splits on the sub-giant (SGB) and the

transport is crucial for diverse applications ranging from thermal management
to energy conversion. Grain boundaries (GBs) are ubiquitous defects in
polycrystalline materials, which scatter phonons and reduce thermal
conductivity. Historically, their impact on heat conduction has been studied
indirectly through spatially-averaged measurements, that provide little
information about phonon transport near a single GB. Here, using
spatially-resolved time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) measurements in
combination with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), we make localized
measurements of thermal conductivity within few \mu m of individual GBs in
boron-doped polycrystalline diamond. We observe strongly suppressed thermal
transport near GBs, a reduction in conductivity from ~1000 W/m-K at the center
of large grains to ~400 W/m-K in the immediate vicinity of GBs. Furthermore, we
show that this reduction in conductivity is measured up to ~10 \mu m away from
a GB. A theoretical model is proposed that captures the local reduction in
phonon mean-free-paths due to strongly diffuse phonon scattering at the
disordered grain boundaries. Our results provide a new framework for
understanding phonon-defect interactions in nanomaterials, with implications
for the use of high thermal conductivity polycrystalline materials as heat

common knowledge workers than defining RDF statements, in this paper, we
propose an easy-to-use, zero-configuration, web-based spreadsheet editor that
simultaneously transfers spreadsheet entries into RDF statements. It enables
various kinds of users to easily create semantic data whether they are RDF
experts or novices. The typical scenario we address focuses on creating
instance data starting with an empty knowledge base that is filled
incrementally. In a user study, participants were able to create more
statements in shorter time, having similar or even significantly outperforming
quality, compared to other approaches.

installed by default on Windows machines. While PowerShell can be configured by
administrators for restricting access and reducing vulnerabilities, these
restrictions can be bypassed. Moreover, PowerShell commands can be easily
generated dynamically, executed from memory, encoded and obfuscated, thus
making the logging and forensic analysis of code executed by PowerShell
challenging.For all these reasons, PowerShell is increasingly used by
cybercriminals as part of their attacks' tool chain, mainly for downloading
malicious contents and for lateral movement. Indeed, a recent comprehensive
technical report by Symantec dedicated to PowerShell's abuse by cybercrimials
reported on a sharp increase in the number of malicious PowerShell samples they
received and in the number of penetration tools and frameworks that use
PowerShell. This highlights the urgent need of developing effective methods for
detecting malicious PowerShell commands.In this work, we address this challenge
by implementing several novel detectors of malicious PowerShell commands and
evaluating their performance. We implemented both ""traditional"" natural
language processing (NLP) based detectors and detectors based on
character-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Detectors' performance
was evaluated using a large real-world dataset.Our evaluation results show
that, although our detectors individually yield high performance, an ensemble
detector that combines an NLP-based classifier with a CNN-based classifier
provides the best performance, since the latter classifier is able to detect
malicious commands that succeed in evading the former. Our analysis of these
evasive commands reveals that some obfuscation patterns automatically detected
by the CNN classifier are intrinsically difficult to detect using the NLP
techniques we applied.

insertions, deletions, and substitutions that need to be made to transform one
of the strings to another one. Approximating edit distance in subquadratic time
is ""one of the biggest unsolved problems in the field of combinatorial pattern
matching"". Our main result is a quantum constant approximation algorithm for
computing the edit distance in truly subquadratic time. More precisely, we give
an $O(n^{1.858})$ quantum algorithm that approximates the edit distance within
a factor of $7$. We further extend this result to an $O(n^{1.781})$ quantum
algorithm that approximates the edit distance within a larger constant factor.
  Our solutions are based on a framework for approximating edit distance in
parallel settings. This framework requires as black box an algorithm that
computes the distances of several smaller strings all at once. For a quantum
algorithm, we reduce the black box to \textit{metric estimation} and provide
efficient algorithms for approximating it. We further show that this framework
enables us to approximate edit distance in distributed settings. To this end,
we provide a MapReduce algorithm to approximate edit distance within a factor
of $3$, with sublinearly many machines and sublinear memory. Also, our
algorithm runs in a logarithmic number of rounds.

Here, we use joint GW-EM observations to measure the viewing angle of GW170817,
the angle between the binary's angular momentum and the line of sight. We
combine a direct measurement of the distance to the host galaxy of GW170817
(NGC 4993) of $40.7\pm 2.36$ Mpc with the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)/Virgo GW data and find that the viewing
angle is $32^{+10}_{-13}\,\pm 1.7$ degrees (90% confidence, statistical, and
systematic errors). We place a conservative lower limit on the viewing angle of
$\ge 13^\circ$, which is robust to the choice of prior. This measurement
provides a constraint on models of the prompt $\gamma$-ray and radio/X-ray
afterglow emission associated with the merger; for example, it is consistent
with the off-axis viewing angle inferred for a structured jet model. We provide
for the first time the full posterior samples from Bayesian parameter

Structural characteristics, e.g. a cluster size distribution, a number of

heat, are obtained for a range of temperature. In both cases, the cluster size
distribution becomes bimodal and elongated clusters appear at the temperature

candidates of a young active galactic nucleus (AGN) that is still embedded in
its optical host galaxy. The compact radio structure, with a maximal extent of
a few parsecs, makes it a member of the group of compact symmetric objects
(CSO). Its environment imposes a turnover of the radio synchrotron spectrum
towards lower frequencies, also classifying PKS 1718$-$649 as gigahertz-peaked
radio spectrum (GPS) source. Its close proximity has allowed the first
detection of extended X-ray emission in a GPS/CSO source with Chandra that is
for the most part unrelated to nuclear feedback. However, not much is known
about the nature of this emission. By co-adding all archival Chandra data and
complementing these datasets with the large effective area of XMM-Newton, we
are able to study the detailed physics of the environment of PKS 1718$-$649.
Not only can we confirm that the bulk of the $\lesssim$kiloparsec-scale
environment emits in the soft X-rays, but we also identify the emitting gas to
form a hot, collisionally ionized medium. While the feedback of the central AGN
still seems to be constrained to the inner few parsecs, we argue that
supernovae are capable of producing the observed large-scale X-ray emission at
a rate inferred from its estimated star formation rate.

doped EuTiO3. In particular, the topological Hall effect contribution appears
at higher temperatures and the anomalous Hall effect shows a sign change with
temperature. The results suggest that interfaces can be used to tune
topological phenomena in itinerant magnetic systems.

have shown greater potential to process complex sequential information than the
traditional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The conventional LSTM, however,
fails to take into consideration the impact of salient spatio-temporal dynamics
present in the sequential input data. This problem was first addressed by the
differential Recurrent Neural Network (dRNN), which uses a differential gating
scheme known as Derivative of States (DoS). DoS uses higher orders of internal
state derivatives to analyze the change in information gain caused by the
salient motions between the successive frames. The weighted combination of
several orders of DoS is then used to modulate the gates in dRNN. While each
individual order of DoS is good at modeling a certain level of salient
spatio-temporal sequences, the sum of all the orders of DoS could distort the
detected motion patterns. To address this problem, we propose to control the
LSTM gates via individual orders of DoS and stack multiple levels of LSTM cells
in an increasing order of state derivatives. The proposed model progressively
builds up the ability of the LSTM gates to detect salient dynamical patterns in
deeper stacked layers modeling higher orders of DoS, and thus the proposed LSTM
model is termed deep differential Recurrent Neural Network (d2RNN). The
effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on two publicly available
human activity datasets: NUS-HGA and Violent-Flows. The proposed model
outperforms both LSTM and non-LSTM based state-of-the-art algorithms.

""no"" for all $r\ge 4$. For instance, there are $4$-colorings of $K_{n,n}$ where
the largest balanced monochromatic component has $n/5$ vertices in both partite

observables can be broadly partitioned into two categories: differential, or
undifferenced. The differential techniques (e.g., real-time kinematic (RTK))
have several attractive properties, such as correlated error mitigation and
fast convergence; however, to support a differential processing scheme, an
infrastructure of reference stations within a proximity of the platform must be
in place to construct observation corrections. This infrastructure requirement
makes differential processing techniques infeasible in many locations. To
mitigate the need for additional receivers within proximity of the platform,
the precise point positioning (PPP) method utilizes accurate orbit and clock
models to localize the platform. The autonomy of PPP from local reference
stations make it an attractive processing scheme for several applications;
however, a current disadvantage of PPP is the slow positioning convergence when
compared to differential techniques. In this paper, we evaluate the convergence
properties of PPP with an incremental graph optimization scheme (Incremental
Smoothing and Mapping (iSAM2)), which allows for real-time filtering and
smoothing. The characterization is first conducted through a Monte Carlo
analysis within a simulation environment, which allows for the variations of
parameters, such as atmospheric conditions, satellite geometry, and intensity
of multipath. Then, an example collected data set is utilized to validate the

method should accurately aproximate the probability density function of the

affect the mean behavior of trajectories. We show that numerical simulations
converge, not to the exact probability density function (pdf) of the

we find that the observed statistical bias is exacerbated for multi-scale

in certain multi-scale systems solvers of sufficiently high order are
necessary. Alternatively, backward error analysis suggests the form of an

Though recent deep learning based methods work well for rigid objects, they
often fail on objects with large articulation, like human bodies. The core step
of existing methods is to fit a map from the observable views to novel views by
CNNs; however, the rich articulation modes of human body make it rather
challenging for CNNs to memorize and interpolate the data well. To address the
problem, we propose a novel deep learning based pipeline that explicitly
estimates and leverages the geometry of the underlying human body. Our new
pipeline is a composition of a shape estimation network and an image generation
network, and at the interface a perspective transformation is applied to
generate a forward flow for pixel value transportation. Our design is able to
factor out the space of data variation and makes learning at each step much
easier. Empirically, we show that the performance for pose-varying objects can
be improved dramatically. Our method can also be applied on real data captured
by 3D sensors, and the flow generated by our methods can be used for generating
high quality results in higher resolution.

Adam, Adadelta), parameter updates are scaled by the inverse square roots of
exponential moving averages of squared past gradients. Maintaining these
per-parameter second-moment estimators requires memory equal to the number of
parameters. For the case of neural network weight matrices, we propose
maintaining only the per-row and per-column sums of these moving averages, and
estimating the per-parameter second moments based on these sums. We demonstrate
empirically that this method produces similar results to the baseline.
Secondly, we show that adaptive methods can produce larger-than-desired updates
when the decay rate of the second moment accumulator is too slow. We propose
update clipping and a gradually increasing decay rate scheme as remedies.
Combining these methods and dropping momentum, we achieve comparable results to
the published Adam regime in training the Transformer model on the WMT 2014
English-German machine translation task, while using very little auxiliary
storage in the optimizer. Finally, we propose scaling the parameter updates

power systems. An OPF problem optimizes a specified objective function subject
to constraints imposed by both the non-linear power flow equations and
engineering limits. These constraints can yield non-convex feasible spaces that
result in significant computational challenges. Despite these non-convexities,
local solution algorithms actually find the global optima of some practical OPF
problems. This suggests that OPF problems have a range of difficulty: some
problems appear to have convex or ""nearly convex"" feasible spaces in terms of
the voltage magnitudes and power injections, while other problems can exhibit
significant non-convexities. Understanding this range of problem difficulty is
helpful for creating new test cases for algorithmic benchmarking purposes.
Leveraging recently developed computational tools for exploring OPF feasible

non-convexities for small OPF problems. This paper then proposes and analyzes

in discovery studies the sample size is typically small while the number of
markers being explored is much larger. Hence discovery studies suffer from
sparsity and high dimensionality issues. Currently the state-of-the-art methods
either find too many false positives or fail to identify many truly relevant

accurately finding the truly relevant protein markers in discovery studies. Our
method fits especially well with discovery studies because they are mostly
balanced design due to the fact that experiments are limited and controlled.
Our approach is based on the observation that the underlying distributions of
expression profiles are unimodal for those irrelevant plain markers. Our method
has asymptotic chi-square null distribution which facilitates the efficient
control of false discovery rate. We then evaluate our method using both
simulated and real experimental data. In all the experiments our method is
highly effective to discover the set of truly relevant markers, leading to
accurate biomarker identifications with high sensitivity and low empirical

Using direct numerical simulations, we estimate the compositional transport

number, inversely proportional to the rotation rate, and the density ratio
which measures the relative thermal and compositional stratifications. Within
our explored range of parameters, we generally find rotation to have little

a core task in many scene understanding problems. In real world applications, a
dynamic scene is commonly captured by a moving camera (i.e., panning, tilting
or hand-held), increasing the task complexity because the scene is observed
from different view points. The main challenge is the disambiguation of the
camera motion from scene motion, which becomes more difficult as the amount of
rigidity observed decreases, even with successful estimation of 2D image
correspondences. Compared to other state-of-the-art 3D scene flow estimation
methods, in this paper we propose to \emph{learn} the rigidity of a scene in a
supervised manner from a large collection of dynamic scene data, and directly
infer a rigidity mask from two sequential images with depths. With the learned
network, we show how we can effectively estimate camera motion and projected
scene flow using computed 2D optical flow and the inferred rigidity mask. For
training and testing the rigidity network, we also provide a new semi-synthetic
dynamic scene dataset (synthetic foreground objects with a real background) and
an evaluation split that accounts for the percentage of observed non-rigid
pixels. Through our evaluation we show the proposed framework outperforms
current state-of-the-art scene flow estimation methods in challenging dynamic

applications such as social network analysis. It is typically defined in terms
of subgraph isomorphism which is NP-Complete. To lower its complexity, many
extensions of graph simulation have been proposed which focus on some
topological constraints of pattern graphs that can be preserved in
polynomial-time over data graphs. We discuss in this paper the satisfaction of
a new topological constraint, called Label-Repetition constraint. To the best
of our knowledge, existing polynomial approaches fail to preserve this
constraint, and moreover, one can adopt only subgraph isomorphism for this end
which is cost-prohibitive. We present first a necessary and sufficient
condition that a data subgraph must satisfy to preserve the Label-Repetition
constraints of the pattern graph. Furthermore, we define matching based on a
notion of triple simulation, an extension of graph simulation by considering
the new topological constraint. We show that with this extension, graph pattern
matching can be performed in polynomial-time, by providing such an algorithm.
Our algorithm is sub-quadratic in the size of data graphs only, and quartic in
general. We show that our results can be combined with orthogonal approaches
for more expressive graph pattern matching.

$F_2$. The current is injected through the $F_1$ layer by means of an applied
bias voltage. The second configuration involves a $S F_1 F_2 F_3 S$ Josephson
junction whereby a phase difference $\Delta\varphi$ between the two
superconducting electrodes generates the supercurrent flow. In this case, the
central half-metallic $F_2$ layer is surrounded by two weak ferromagnets $F_1$

$S$ layer, we are able to optimize the conversion process in which
opposite-spin triplet pairs are converted into equal-spin triplet pairs that
propagate deep into the half-metallic regions in both junction types. For the
tunnel junctions, we study the bias-induced local magnetization, spin currents,
and spin transfer torques for various orientations of the relative

anticorrelated with the opposite-spin pairs. We show that the charge current

facial decomposition of the cone of functionals in the dual space $V^{*}$
having representing measures. We prove a generalization of the Truncated
Riesz-Haviland Theorem of Curto-Fialkow, which permits us to solve a
generalized Truncated Moment Problem in terms of positive extensions of $L$.
These results are adapted to derive a Riesz-Haviland Theorem for a generalized

Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) survey. We find that PSF
chromaticity is present in that redder stars appear smaller than bluer stars in
the $g, r,$ and $i$-bands at the 1-2 per cent level and in the $z$ and
$y$-bands at the 0.1-0.2 per cent level. From the color dependence of the PSF,
we fit a model between the monochromatic PSF trace radius, $R$, and wavelength
of the form $R(\lambda)\propto \lambda^{b}$. We find values of $b$ between -0.2
and -0.5, depending on the epoch and filter. This is consistent with the
expectations of a turbulent atmosphere with an outer scale length of $\sim
10-100$ m, indicating that the atmosphere is dominating the chromaticity. We
find evidence in the best seeing data that the optical system and detector also
contribute some wavelength dependence. Meyers and Burchat (2015) showed that
$b$ must be measured to an accuracy of $\sim 0.02$ not to dominate the
systematic error budget of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) weak
lensing (WL) survey. Using simple image simulations, we find that $b$ can be
inferred with this accuracy in the $r$ and $i$-bands for all positions in the
LSST field of view, assuming a stellar density of 1 star arcmin$^{-2}$ and that
the optical PSF can be accurately modeled. Therefore, it is possible to correct
for most, if not all, of the bias that the wavelength-dependent PSF will
introduce into an LSST-like WL survey.

several settings. Endemic in approaches to realize such intelligence in
machines is catastrophic forgetting: sequential learning corrupts knowledge
obtained earlier in the sequence, or tasks antagonistically compete for system
resources. Methods for obviating catastrophic forgetting have sought to
identify and preserve features of the system necessary to solve one problem
when learning to solve another, or to enforce modularity such that minimally
overlapping sub-functions contain task specific knowledge. While successful,
both approaches scale poorly because they require larger architectures as the
number of training instances grows, causing different parts of the system to
specialize for separate subsets of the data. Here we present a method for
addressing catastrophic forgetting called developmental compression. It
exploits the mild impacts of developmental mutations to lessen adverse changes
to previously-evolved capabilities and `compresses' specialized neural networks
into a generalized one. In the absence of domain knowledge, developmental
compression produces systems that avoid overt specialization, alleviating the
need to engineer a bespoke system for every task permutation and suggesting
better scalability than existing approaches. We validate this method on a robot
control problem and hope to extend this approach to other machine learning
domains in the future.

simulations serve as important tools for extracting the nuclear
incompressibility. However, uncertainties in transport models (or model
dependence) partly affect the reliability of the extracted result. In the
present work, by using the recently measured data of rapidity-dependent flows,
we constrain the incompressibility of nuclear matter and analyse the impact of
model uncertainties on the obtained value. The method is based on the newly
updated version of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD)
model in which the Skyrme potential energy-density functional is introduced.
Three different Skyrme interactions which give different incompressibilities
varying from $K_0$=201 to 271 MeV are adopted. The incompressibility is deduced
from the comparison of the UrQMD model simulations and the FOPI data for
rapidity-dependent elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at beam energies
0.4\emph{A} - 1.0\emph{A} GeV. The elliptic flow $v_2$ as a function of
rapidity $y_0$ can be well described by a quadratic fit $v_2=v_{20} +
v_{22}\cdot y_0^2 $. It is found that the quantity $v_{2n}$ defined by
$v_{2n}=|v_{20}|+|v_{22}|$ is quite sensitive to the incompressibility $K_0$
and the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, but not sensitive to the slope
parameter $L$ of the nuclear symmetry energy. With the FU3FP4 parametrization
of the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, an averaged $K_0 = 220 \pm
40$~MeV is extracted from the $v_{2n}$ of free protons and deuterons. However,
remaining systematic uncertainties, partly related to the choice of in-medium
nucleon-nucleon cross sections, are of the same magnitude ($\pm 40$~MeV).
Overall, the rapidity dependent elliptic flow supports a soft symmetric-matter
equation-of-state.

to the newly experimental data released by the FOPI collaboration at GSI. It is
found that the directed flow is more sensitive to the pion potential than the
elliptic one, and the attractive pion potential from the phen.B mode of the
phenomenological approach is too strong to describe the flow data and can be
safely ruled out. The relatively weak pion potential from the $\Delta$-hole
model can supply a good description for the FOPI data of both flows as
functions of both centrality and rapidity. A two-peak/valley structure occurs
in the transverse-velocity dependent directed flow but the elliptic flow drops
monotonously with increasing $u_{t0}$. Finally, both $v_1$ and $v_2$ flows with
large $u_{t0}$ from semi-central heavy ion collisions can be taken as sensitive

of PDE-constrained optimal control under high-dimensional uncertainty.
Specifically, we consider a mean-variance formulation of the control objective
and employ a Taylor expansion with respect to the uncertain parameter either to
directly approximate the control objective or as a control variate for variance
reduction. The expressions for the mean and variance of the Taylor
approximation are known analytically, although their evaluation requires
efficient computation of the trace of the (preconditioned) Hessian of the
control objective. We propose to estimate this trace by solving a generalized
eigenvalue problem using a randomized algorithm that only requires the action
of the Hessian on a small number of random directions. Then, the computational
work does not depend on the nominal dimension of the uncertain parameter, but
depends only on the effective dimension, thus ensuring scalability to
high-dimensional problems. Moreover, to increase the estimation accuracy of the
mean and variance of the control objective by the Taylor approximation, we use
it as a control variate for variance reduction, which results in considerable
computational savings (several orders of magnitude) compared to a plain Monte
Carlo method. We demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of the
proposed computational method for two examples with high-dimensional uncertain
parameters: subsurface flow in a porous medium modeled as an elliptic PDE, and
turbulent jet flow modeled by the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations
coupled with a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation characterizing model
uncertainty. In particular, for the latter more challenging example we show
scalability of our algorithm up to one million parameters resulting from
discretization of the uncertain parameter field.

the development of a spin-liquid phase sandwiched between the N\'eel and spin

properties of this universal spin liquid phase. We examine the phase diagram
near the Lifshitz point and calculate the positions of critical points,
excitation spectra, and spin-spin correlations functions. We argue that the
spin liquid in the vicinity of 2D Lifshitz point (LP) is similar to the gapped
Haldane phase in integer-spin 1D chains. We also consider a specific example of
a frustrated system with the spiral-N\'eel LP, the $J_1-J_3$ antiferromagnet on

problem. In this paper, this minimization program is recast as a matrix
completion problem of a low-rank $r$ Gram matrix with respect to a suitable
basis. The well known restricted isometry property can not be satisfied in this
scenario. Instead, a dual basis approach is introduced to theoretically analyze
the reconstruction problem. If the Gram matrix satisfies certain coherence
conditions with parameter $\nu$, the main result shows that the underlying
configuration of $n$ points can be recovered with very high probability from
$O(nr\nu\log^{2}(n))$ uniformly random samples. Computationally, simple and
fast algorithms are designed to solve the Euclidean distance geometry problem.

novel and generic solution based on boundary erosion is proposed. The clusters
are assumed to be separated by relatively sparse regions. The samples are
eroded sequentially according to their dynamic boundary densities. The erosion
starts from low density regions, invading inwards, until all the samples are
eroded out. By this manner, boundaries between different clusters become more
and more apparent. It therefore offers a natural and powerful way to separate
the clusters when the boundaries between them are hard to be drawn at once.
With the sequential order of being eroded, the sequential boundary levels are
produced, following which the clusters in arbitrary shapes are automatically
reconstructed. As demonstrated across various clustering tasks, it is able to
outperform most of the state-of-the-art algorithms and its performance is
nearly perfect in some scenarios.

has been extensively studied in brain science, psychology, and other
disciplines. Decision-making mechanisms have also been experimentally
implemented in physical processes, such as single photons and chaotic lasers.
The findings of these experiments suggest that there is a certain common basis
in describing decision making, regardless of its physical realizations. In this
study, we propose a local reservoir model to account for choice-based learning
(CBL). CBL describes decision consistency as a phenomenon where making a
certain decision increases the possibility of making that same decision again
later, which has been intensively investigated in neuroscience, psychology,
etc. Our proposed model is inspired by the viewpoint that a decision is
affected by its local environment, which is referred to as a local reservoir.
If the size of the local reservoir is large enough, consecutive decision making
will not be affected by previous decisions, thus showing lower degrees of
decision consistency in CBL. In contrast, if the size of the local reservoir
decreases, a biased distribution occurs within it, which leads to higher
degrees of decision consistency in CBL. In this study, an analytical approach
on local reservoirs is presented, as well as several numerical demonstrations.
Furthermore, a physical architecture for CBL based on single photons is
discussed, and the effects of local reservoirs is numerically demonstrated.
Decision consistency in human decision-making tasks and in recruiting empirical
data are evaluated based on local reservoir. In summary, the proposed local
reservoir model paves a path toward establishing a foundation for computational
mechanisms and the systematic analysis of decision making on different levels.

neural architecture for the group recommendation task. Group-level
recommendation is known to be a challenging task, in which intricate group
dynamics have to be considered. As such, this is to be contrasted with the
standard recommendation problem where recommendations are personalized with
respect to a single user. Our proposed approach hinges upon the key intuition
that the decision making process (in groups) is generally dynamic, i.e., a
user's decision is highly dependent on the other group members. All in all, our
key motivation manifests in a form of an attentive neural model that captures
fine-grained interactions between group members. In our MoSAN model, each
sub-attention module is representative of a single member, which models a
user's preference with respect to all other group members. Subsequently, a
Medley of Sub-Attention modules is then used to collectively make the group's
final decision. Overall, our proposed model is both expressive and effective.
Via a series of extensive experiments, we show that MoSAN not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance but also improves standard baselines by a
considerable margin.

two parts: the porous matrix and vugs. Then, we model the hydro-mechanical

Stokes equations within the vugs, and an extended Beavers-Joseph-Saffman

hydro-mechanical coupling behavior of vuggy porous media on larger scale.
Subsequently, the macroscopic poroelastic coefficients, such as the effective
Darcy permeability, effective Young's modulus and effective Biot coefficient,

domains using the generating process with new values for the latent variables
in G-DAN. In practice, the process to generate all features together may
involve high-dimensional latent variables, requiring dealing with distributions
in high dimensions and making it difficult to learn domain changes from few
source domains. Interestingly, by further making use of the causal
representation of joint distributions, we then decompose the joint distribution
into separate modules, each of which involves different low-dimensional latent
variables and can be learned separately, leading to a Causal G-DAN (CG-DAN).
This improves both statistical and computational efficiency of the learning
procedure. Finally, by matching the feature distribution in the target domain,
we can recover the target-domain joint distribution and derive the learning
machine for the target domain. We demonstrate the efficacy of both G-DAN and

the original unit cell below T_MI2, accompanied by a change of the crystal
system from the orthorhombic structure to the monoclinic one. Simple
dimerization of the Ru ions is nor seen in the ground state. The multiple As
sites observed in nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectrum also demonstrate
the formation of the superlattice in the ground state, which is clarified to be
nonmagnetic. The divergence in 1/T_1 at T_MI1 shows that a symmetry lowering by
the metal-insulator transition is accompanied by strong critical fluctuations
of some degrees of freedom. Using the structural parameters in the insulating

size of nuclear quadrupole frequencies for the multiple As sites, ensuring the
high validity of the structural parameters. The calculation also gives a
remarkable suppression in the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level,

synthesize realistically looking images of faces, scenery and even medical
images. Unfortunately, they usually require large training datasets, which are
often scarce in the medical field, and to the best of our knowledge GANs have
been only applied for medical image synthesis at fairly low resolution.
However, many state-of-the-art machine learning models operate on high
resolution data as such data carries indispensable, valuable information. In
this work, we try to generate realistically looking high resolution images of
skin lesions with GANs, using only a small training dataset of 2000 samples.
The nature of the data allows us to do a direct comparison between the image
statistics of the generated samples and the real dataset. We both
quantitatively and qualitatively compare state-of-the-art GAN architectures
such as DCGAN and LAPGAN against a modification of the latter for the task of
image generation at a resolution of 256x256px. Our investigation shows that we
can approximate the real data distribution with all of the models, but we
notice major differences when visually rating sample realism, diversity and
artifacts. In a set of use-case experiments on skin lesion classification, we
further show that we can successfully tackle the problem of heavy class
imbalance with the help of synthesized high resolution melanoma samples.

intelligent transportation systems, security, and logistics. However, there is
currently no large-scale public dataset for benchmarking approaches on this
problem. This work fills this gap by introducing the first real-world RGB-D
People Counting DataSet (PCDS) containing over 4,500 videos recorded at the
entrance doors of buses in normal and cluttered conditions. It also proposes an
efficient method for counting people in real-world cluttered scenes related to
public transportations using depth videos. The proposed method computes a point
cloud from the depth video frame and re-projects it onto the ground plane to
normalize the depth information. The resulting depth image is analyzed for
identifying potential human heads. The human head proposals are meticulously
refined using a 3D human model. The proposals in each frame of the continuous
video stream are tracked to trace their trajectories. The trajectories are
again refined to ascertain reliable counting. People are eventually counted by
accumulating the head trajectories leaving the scene. To enable effective head
and trajectory identification, we also propose two different compound features.
A thorough evaluation on PCDS demonstrates that our technique is able to count
people in cluttered scenes with high accuracy at 45 fps on a 1.7 GHz processor,
and hence it can be deployed for effective real-time people counting for
intelligent transportation systems.

to be either cropped or downsampled due to limited memory capacity of computing
devices. These operations lead to loss of resolution and increment of class
imbalance in the input data batches, which can downgrade the performances of
segmentation algorithms. Inspired by the architecture of image super-resolution

modified Unet framework that simultaneously learns to detect a ROI within the

Experiments on a variety of multi-modal volumes demonstrated that, when trained

this framework shows better segmentation performances than state-of-the-art

computational technique to derive stability-optimized adaptive methods of
strong order 1.5 for SDEs. The resulting explicit methods are shown to exhibit
substantially enlarged stability regions which allows for them to solve
pathwise stiff biological models orders of magnitude more efficiently than
previous methods like SRIW1 and Euler-Maruyama. Secondly, these integrators
include a stiffness estimator which allows for automatically switching between

adaptive L-stable strong order 1.5 implicit integrators for SDEs and stochastic

IoT vendors to develop formal specifications of the intended purpose of their
IoT devices, in the form of a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD), so that
their network behavior in any operating environment can be locked down and
verified rigorously.
  This paper aims to assist IoT manufacturers in developing and verifying MUD
profiles, while also helping adopters of these devices to ensure they are
compatible with their organizational policies. Our first contribution is to
develop a tool that takes the traffic trace of an arbitrary IoT device as input
and automatically generates a MUD profile for it. We contribute our tool as
open source, apply it to 28 consumer IoT devices, and highlight insights and
challenges encountered in the process. Our second contribution is to apply a
formal semantic framework that not only validates a given MUD profile for
consistency, but also checks its compatibility with a given organizational

selected devices, to demonstrate how MUD can reduce the effort needed for IoT

Bayesian inference in non-linear and non-Gaussian state space models. Our
article shows how to scale up PMCMC in terms of the number of observations and
parameters by expressing the target density of the PMCMC in terms of the basic
uniform or standard normal random numbers, instead of the particles, used in
the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm. Parameters that can be drawn efficiently
conditional on the particles are generated by particle Gibbs. All the other
parameters are drawn by conditioning on the basic uniform or standard normal
random variables; e.g. parameters that are highly correlated with the states,
or parameters whose generation is expensive when conditioning on the states.
The performance of this hybrid sampler is investigated empirically by applying
it to univariate and multivariate stochastic volatility models having both a
large number of parameters and a large number of latent states and shows that
it is much more efficient than competing PMCMC methods. We also show that the
proposed hybrid sampler is ergodic.

coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans of 163 patients. To perform automatic

recurrent convolutional neural network is applied on multi-planar reformatted
(MPR) images of the coronary arteries. First, a 3D convolutional neural network
is utilized to extract features along the coronary artery. Subsequently, the
extracted features are aggregated by a recurrent neural network that performs
two simultaneous multi-class classification tasks. In the first task, the
network detects and characterizes the type of the coronary artery plaque (no
plaque, non-calcified, mixed, calcified). In the second task, the network
detects and determines the anatomical significance of the coronary artery
stenosis (no stenosis, non-significant i.e. <50% luminal narrowing, significant
i.e. >50% luminal narrowing). For detection and classification of coronary
plaque, the method achieved an accuracy of 0.77. For detection and
classification of stenosis, the method achieved an accuracy of 0.80. The
results demonstrate that automatic detection and classification of coronary

a well-known problem in RDF stream reasoning. Higher expressiveness supports
more complex reasoning logic, however, it may also hinder system scalability.
Current research mainly focuses on logical frameworks suitable for stream
reasoning as well as the implementation and the evaluation of prototype
systems. These systems are normally developed in a centralized setting which
suffer from inherent limited scalability, while an in-depth study of applying
distributed solutions to cover E&S is still missing. In this paper, we aim to
explore the feasibility of applying modern distributed computing frameworks to
meet E&S all together. To do so, we first propose BigSR, a technical
demonstrator that supports a positive fragment of the LARS framework. For the
sake of generality and to cover a wide variety of use cases, BigSR relies on
the two main execution models adopted by major distributed execution
frameworks: Bulk Synchronous Processing (BSP) and Record-at-A-Time (RAT).
Accordingly, we implement BigSR on top of Apache Spark Streaming (BSP model)
and Apache Flink (RAT model). In order to conclude on the impacts of BSP and
RAT on E&S, we analyze the ability of the two models to support distributed
stream reasoning and identify several types of use cases characterized by their
levels of support. This classification allows for quantifying the E&S trade-off
by assessing the scalability of each type of use case \wrt its level of
expressiveness. Then, we conduct a series of experiments with 15 queries from 4
different datasets. Our experiments show that BigSR over both BSP and RAT
generally scales up to high throughput beyond million-triples per second (with
or without recursion), and RAT attains sub-millisecond delay for stateless
query operators.

crystalline, polycrystalline and other materials --- feature a predominantly
elastic response at small stresses, plasticity onset at a rather well-defined
yield stress and rate-dependence. Necking instabilities involve a unique
coupling between the system's geometry and its constitutive behavior. We
consider generic elasto-viscoplastic constitutive relations involving an
internal-state field, which represents the structural evolution of the material
during plastic deformation, and study necking in the long-wavelength
approximation (sometimes termed the lubrication or slender-bar approximation).
We derive a general expression for the largest time-dependent eigenvalue in an
approximate WKB-like linear stability analysis, highlighting various basic
physical effects involved in necking. This expression is then used to propose
criteria for the onset of necking and more importantly for the emergence of
strong localization. Applications to strain-softening amorphous plasticity, in
the framework of the Shear-Transformation-Zone model, and to strain-hardening
crystalline/polycrystalline plasticity, in the framework of the Kocks-Mecking

replacements. So far, our understanding of the process of colloidal gelation is
limited to long-time dynamical effects, where gelation is viewed as a phase
separation process interrupted by the glass transition. However, this picture
neglects two important effects: the influence of hydrodynamic interactions, and
the emergence of mechanical stability. With confocal microscopy experiments,
here we successfully follow the entire process of gelation with a
single-particle resolution, yielding time-resolved measures of internal stress
and viscoelasticity from the very beginning of the aggregation process. First,
we demonstrate that the incompressible nature of a liquid component constrains
the initial stage of phase separation, assisting the formation of a percolated
network. Then we show that this network is not mechanically stable and
undergoes rearrangements driven by self-generated internal stress. Finally, we
show that mechanical metastability is reached only after percolation of locally
isostatic environments, proving isostaticity a necessary condition for the
stability and load bearing ability of gels rather than the glass transition.
Our work reveals the crucial roles of momentum conservation in gelation in
addition to the conventional purely out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic picture.

questions we study concern a necessary and sufficient ratio with which a player
can achieve a goal. For reachability objectives, such {\em threshold ratios}

  In the proposed method, a Wasserstein generative adversarial network (GAN)

generator tries to synthesize realistic blood vessel geometries, the
discriminator tries to distinguish synthesized geometries from those of real
blood vessels. Both real and synthesized blood vessel geometries are
parametrized as 1D signals based on the central vessel axis. The generator can
optionally be provided with an attribute vector to synthesize vessels with
particular characteristics.
  The GAN was optimized using a reference database with parametrizations of
4,412 real coronary artery geometries extracted from CCTA scans. After
training, plausible coronary artery geometries could be synthesized based on
random vectors sampled from a latent space. A qualitative analysis showed
strong similarities between real and synthesized coronary arteries. A detailed
analysis of the latent space showed that the diversity present in coronary
artery anatomy was accurately captured by the generator.
  Results show that Wasserstein generative adversarial networks can be used to
synthesize blood vessel geometries.

the basis for automatic analysis of the spine, such as detection of vertebral

iterative instance segmentation approach that uses a fully convolutional neural

enabled by combining the network with a memory component that retains

image patches, using information from both image and memory to search for the
next vertebra. To efficiently traverse the image, we include the prior
knowledge that the vertebrae are always located next to each other, which is
used to follow the vertebral column. This method was evaluated with five
diverse datasets, including multiple modalities (CT and MR), various fields of
view and coverages of different sections of the spine, and a particularly
challenging set of low-dose chest CT scans. The proposed iterative segmentation

commercial magnetic force microscopy (MFM) probes using focused ion beam
lithography. Excess of magnetic coating from the probes was milled out, leaving
a V-shaped nanostructure on one face of the probe apex. Owing to the
nanostructure's shape anisotropy, such probe has four possible magnetic states
depending on the direction of the magnetization along each arm of the V-shape.
Two states of opposite polarity are characterised by the presence of a
geometrically constrained DW, pinned at the corner of the V-shape
nanostructure. In the other two states, the magnetization curls around the
corner with opposite chirality. Electron holography studies, supported by
numerical simulations, demonstrate that a strong stray field emanates from the
pinned DW, whilst a much weaker stray field is generated by the curling
configurations. Using in situ MFM, we show that the magnetization states of the
DW-probe can be easily controlled by applying an external magnetic field,
thereby demonstrating that this type of probe can be used as a switchable tool
with a low or high stray field intensity. We demonstrate that DW-probes enable
acquiring magnetic images with a negligible interference with the sample
magnetization, similar to that of commercial low moment probes, but with a
higher magnetic contrast. In addition, the DW-probe in the curl state provides
complementary information about the in-plane component of the sample's
magnetization, which is not achievable by standard methods and provides
additional information about the stray fields, e.g. as when imaging DWs.

multi-agent systems in different applications. In this paper we consider
multi-agent systems that can be modeled by means of potential games whose
potential function coincides with a global objective function to be maximized.
In this approach, the agents correspond to the strategic decision makers and
the optimization problem is equivalent to the problem of learning a potential
function maximizer in the designed game. The paper deals with two different
information settings in the system. Firstly, we consider systems, where agents
have the access to the gradient of their utility functions. However, they do
not possess the full information about the joint actions. Thus, to be able to
move along the gradient toward a local optimum, they need to exchange the
information with their neighbors by means of communication. The second setting
refers to a payoff-based approach to learning potential function maximizers.
Here, we assume that at each iteration agents can only observe their own played
actions and experienced payoffs. In both cases, the paper studies unconstrained
non-convex optimization with a differentiable objective function. To develop
the corresponding algorithms guaranteeing convergence to a local maximum of the
potential function in the game, we utilize the idea of the well-known
Robbins-Monro procedure based on the theory of stochastic approximation.

Second, not only static structure of the graphs and causality relationships are

associated with distinguishing facts such as: all six characters are equally
prominent; it has no dominant storyline; and friendship as surrogate family.
This paper uses tools from network theory to check whether these and other
assumptions can be quantified and proved correct. The main findings regarding
the centrality and temporal aspects are: patterns in graphs representing
different time slices of the show change; overall, degrees of the six friends
are indeed nearly the same; however, in different situations (thus graphs), the
magnitudes of degree centrality do change; betweenness centrality differs
significantly for each character thus some characters are better connectors
than others; there is a high difference regarding degrees of the six friends
versus the rest of the characters, which points to a centralized network; there
are strong indications that the six friends are part of a surrogate family. As
for the presence of groups within the network, methods of different natures
were investigated aiming at detecting groups (communities) in networks
representing different time slices as well as the network of all episodes. Such
methods were compared (pairwise and also using various metrics, including
plausibility). The multilevel method performs reasonably in general. Also, it
stands out that those methods do not agree very much, resulting in groups that

potential. The pseudorapity range 4<|{\eta}|<5 is of particular interest since
leptonic W decays provide an additional contribution to the neutrino flux from
b and c production. A modest detector of 4.1x$10^{27}$ nucleons/cm$^{2}$,
placed in the LHC tunnel, 25 m from the interaction point, around the focusing
magnet (Q1) closest to CMS, can cover that region. The hadronic calorimeter HF
and the CMS forward shield will protect it from the debris of pp collisions.
With a luminosity of 300/fb, foreseen for the LHC run in the years 2021-2023,
the detector can observe over a thousand {\tau} neutrino interactions, and a
hundred TeV-neutrino interactions of all flavours. Several backgrounds are
considered. A major source can be prompt muons from the interaction point.
However, the CMS magnetic field and the structure of the Forward Shield make
the estimation of their flux in the location of interest uncertain. Besides,

of the three initial mass function (IMF) slopes tested, and that populations

  However, recent analysis by Janka (2017), prompted us to revisit our basic

community in the last few years. To address the challenges in this field, many
researchers have proposed different strategies, which basically exploit either
cross-view invariant features or cross-view robust metrics. In this work, we
propose to exploit a post-ranking approach and combine different feature
representations through ranking aggregation. Spatial information, which
potentially benefits the person matching, is represented using a 2D body model,
from which color and texture information are extracted and combined. We also
consider background/foreground information, automatically extracted via Deep
Decompositional Network, and the usage of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
features. To describe the matching between images we use the polynomial feature
map, also taking into account local and global information. The Discriminant
Context Information Analysis based post-ranking approach is used to improve
initial ranking lists. Finally, the Stuart ranking aggregation method is
employed to combine complementary ranking lists obtained from different feature
representations. Experimental results demonstrated that we improve the
state-of-the-art on VIPeR and PRID450s datasets, achieving 67.21% and 75.64% on
top-1 rank recognition rate, respectively, as well as obtaining competitive
results on CUHK01 dataset.

and surface contamination. CLSM leverages optical properties of graphene and
provides greatly enhanced optical contrast and mapping of thickness down to a
single layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLSM by measuring
mechanically exfoliated and chemical vapor deposition graphene on Si/SiO2, and
epitaxial graphene on SiC. In the case of graphene on Si/SiO2, both CLSM
intensity and height mapping is powerful for analysis of 1-5 layers of
graphene. For epitaxial graphene on SiC substrates, the CLSM intensity allows
us to distinguish features such as dense, parallel 150 nm wide ribbons of
graphene (associated with the early stages of the growth process) and large
regions covered by the interfacial layer and 1-3 layers of graphene. In both
cases, CLSM data shows excellent correlation with conventional optical
microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, conductive
atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Raman mapping, with a
greatly reduced acquisition time. We demonstrate that CLSM is an indispensable
tool for rapid analysis of mass-produced graphene and is equally relevant to
other 2D materials.

They revealed that proteins involved in similar functions tend to be similarly

and cannot fully capture the higher-order organization of protein interactions,
including protein complexes. Results: To model the multi-sale organization of
these complex biological systems, we utilize simplicial complexes from
computational geometry. The question is how to mine these new representations
of PPI networks to reveal additional biological information. To address this,
we define simplets, a generalization of graphlets to simplicial complexes. By
using simplets, we define a sensitive measure of similarity between simplicial
complex network representations that allows for clustering them according to
their data types better than clustering them by using other state-of-the-art
measures, e.g., spectral distance, or facet distribution distance. We model
human and baker's yeast PPI networks as simplicial complexes that capture PPIs
and protein complexes as simplices. On these models, we show that our newly
introduced simplet-based methods cluster proteins by function better than the
clustering methods that use the standard PPI networks, uncovering the new
underlying functional organization of the cell. We demonstrate the existence of
the functional geometry in the PPI data and the superiority of our

mitigating error propagation. Moreover, this paper proposes a barrier

$K$ symbols is allocated with more power as an inserted barrier signal. BDPIM
with OSD (BDPIM-OSD) can limit the error propagation between two adjacent
barriers. To reduce the storing delay when using OSD to detect extremely large

empirically untested. One common assumption is that convolutional neural
networks need to be stable to small translations and deformations to solve
image recognition tasks. For many years, this stability was baked into CNN
architectures by incorporating interleaved pooling layers. Recently, however,
interleaved pooling has largely been abandoned. This raises a number of
questions: Are our intuitions about deformation stability right at all? Is it
important? Is pooling necessary for deformation invariance? If not, how is
deformation invariance achieved in its absence? In this work, we rigorously
test these questions, and find that deformation stability in convolutional
networks is more nuanced than it first appears: (1) Deformation invariance is
not a binary property, but rather that different tasks require different
degrees of deformation stability at different layers. (2) Deformation stability
is not a fixed property of a network and is heavily adjusted over the course of
training, largely through the smoothness of the convolutional filters. (3)
Interleaved pooling layers are neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving
the optimal form of deformation stability for natural image classification. (4)
Pooling confers too much deformation stability for image classification at
initialization, and during training, networks have to learn to counteract this
inductive bias. Together, these findings provide new insights into the role of
interleaved pooling and deformation invariance in CNNs, and demonstrate the
importance of rigorous empirical testing of even our most basic assumptions
about the working of neural networks.

fluid-surfactant phase-field model coupled with the fluid flow, in which the
system is highly nonlinear that couples the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations and two Cahn-Hilliard type equations. We develop two, linear and
second order time marching schemes for solving this system, by combining the
""Invariant Energy Quadratization"" approach for the nonlinear potentials, the
projection method for the Navier-Stokes equation, and a subtle
implicit-explicit treatment for the stress and convective terms. We prove the
well-posedness of the linear system and its unconditional energy stability
rigorously. Various 2D and 3D numerical experiments are performed to validate
the accuracy and energy stability of the proposed schemes.

approaches that interpolate directly in the intensity space are prone to
produce blurry images or even remove structures in the images. Our method
avoids such problems and faithfully preserves the information in the image.
Further, an important advantage of our formulation is that it provides an
unsupervised estimation of bi-directional motion fields. We show that these
motion fields can be used to halve the number of registrations required during
4D reconstruction, thus substantially reducing the reconstruction time.

two problems related to ensuring system herdability are explored. The first is
the input addition problem, which investigates which nodes in a network should

problem of selecting the best single node from which to herd the network, in
the case that a single node is guaranteed to make the system is herdable. In
order to select the best herding node, a novel control energy based herdability
centrality measure is introduced.

actions are defined as global color adjustment operations. Then we train our
agent to learn the optimal global enhancement sequence of the actions. In
addition, we present a 'distort-and-recover' training scheme which only
requires high-quality reference images for training instead of input and
retouched image pairs. Given high-quality reference images, we distort the
images' color distribution and form distorted-reference image pairs for
training. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method produces
decent enhancement results and our DRL approach is more suitable for the

building systems that can solve a substantial subset of them. In the system

Using this language and Bayesian inference, complex visual concepts can be
induced from the examples that are provided in each Bongard problem. Contrary
to other concept learning problems the examples from which concepts are induced
are not random in Bongard problems, instead they are carefully chosen to
communicate the concept, hence requiring pragmatic reasoning. Taking pragmatic
reasoning into account we find good agreement between the concepts with high

determine the spectrum in four different channels. It is found to be
qualitatively different from the elementary one, and especially from the one

terms of the Froehlich-Morchio-Strocchi mechanism. In fact, we find that
analytic methods based on this mechanism, a gauge-invariant extension of

multifractality in the scaling behaviour of local eigenfunctions are reflected
in macroscopic transport coefficients. We conjecture that an incipient
Anderson-localization transition may be the origin of this multifractality. It
is possible that multifractality is ubiquitous in transport properties of

ensembles. The method is an alternative to using an adjoint, which can be very
challenging to formulate and also computationally expensive to solve. The main
novelties of the presented approach are: 1) the use of goals, weighting the
perturbation to help resolve the most important sensitivities, 2) the use of
time windows, which enable the perturbations to be optimised independently for
each window and 3) re-orthogonalisation of the solution through time, which
helps optimise each perturbation when calculating sensitivity maps. These novel
methods greatly reduce the number of ensembles required to form the sensitivity
maps as demonstrated in this paper. As the presented method relies solely on
ensembles obtained from the forward model, it can therefore be applied directly
to forward models of arbitrary complexity arising from, for example,
multi-physics coupling, legacy codes or model chains. It can also be applied to
compute sensitivities for optimisation of sensor placement, optimisation for
design or control, goal-based mesh adaptivity, assessment of goals (e.g. hazard
assessment and mitigation in the natural environment), determining the worth of
current data and data assimilation.
  We analyse and demonstrate the efficiency of the approach by applying the
method to advection problems and also a non-linear heterogeneous multi-phase
porous media problem, showing, in all cases, that the number of ensembles
required to obtain accurate sensitivity maps is relatively low, in the order of

degrade the system performance. In this paper, the problem of estimating the
direction of arrival (DOA) in multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radar
system with unknown mutual coupling effect between antennas is investigated. To
exploit the target sparsity in the spatial domain, the compressed sensing
(CS)-based methods have been proposed by discretizing the detection area and
formulating the dictionary matrix, so an \emph{off-grid} gap is caused by the
discretization processes. In this paper, different from the present DOA
estimation methods, both the off-grid gap due to the sparse sampling and the
unknown mutual coupling effect between antennas are considered at the same
time, and a novel sparse system model for DOA estimation is formulated. Then, a
novel sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based method named sparse Bayesian
learning with the mutual coupling (SBLMC) is proposed, where an
expectation-maximum (EM)-based method is established to estimate all the
unknown parameters including the noise variance, the mutual coupling vectors,
the off-grid vector and the variance vector of scattering coefficients.
Additionally, the prior distributions for all the unknown parameters are
theoretically derived. With regard to the DOA estimation performance, the
proposed SBLMC method can outperform state-of-the-art methods in the MIMO radar
with unknown mutual coupling effect, while keeping the acceptable computational
complexity.

named as Review Network for measuring the influence of customers in online
merchandise sites like Amazon.com. Using this measured influence, we have
proposed a method that evaluates loyalty of customers of a brand based on their
ratings and sentiments of their reviews collected from online merchandise
sites. Review network of a brand is built from all the reviews of all the
products from that brand where nodes are customers and an edge is created if a
customer becomes a potential reader of a review written by another customer.
The centrality of a customer in that review network represents her influence.
Our proposed method named as Social Promoter Score combines loyalty and
centrality of all customers of a brand. We have compared our method with a
baseline approach based on the concept of Net Promoter Score . We have applied
Social Promoter Score on Amazon.com review data set of some well-known brands.
Results show that Social Promoter Score predicts financial health of a brand in
terms of future sales much better than baseline method. We have noticed that in
general effects of Social Promoter Score reflect on the product sales in one to
five months.

network, while inspecting only a small part of that network around a given seed
node. This is much cheaper than finding all communities in a network. Most
methods for local community detection are formulated as ad-hoc optimization
problems. In this work, we instead start from a generative model for networks
with community structure. By assuming that the network is uniform, we can
approximate the structure of unobserved parts of the network to obtain a method
for local community detection. We apply this local approximation technique to
two variants of the stochastic block model. To our knowledge, this results in
the first local community detection methods based on probabilistic models.
Interestingly, in the limit, one of the proposed approximations corresponds to
conductance, a popular metric in this field. Experiments on real and synthetic

range 10.25 < log M*/M_sun < 10.75, we explore the variation in galaxy
structure as a function of morphology and galaxy colour. Our sample of galaxies
is sub-divided into red, green and blue colour groups and into elliptical and
non-elliptical (disk-type) morphologies. Using KiDS and VIKING derived postage
stamp images, a group of eight volunteers visually classified bars, rings,
morphological lenses, tidal streams, shells and signs of merger activity for
all systems. We find a significant surplus of rings ($2.3\sigma$) and lenses
($2.9\sigma$) in disk-type galaxies as they transition across the green valley.
Combined, this implies a joint ring/lens green valley surplus significance of
$3.3\sigma$ relative to equivalent disk-types within either the blue cloud or
the red sequence. We recover a bar fraction of ~44% which remains flat with
colour, however, we find that the presence of a bar acts to modulate the
incidence of rings and (to a lesser extent) lenses, with rings in barred
disk-type galaxies more common by ~20-30 percentage points relative to their
unbarred counterparts, regardless of colour. Additionally, green valley
disk-type galaxies with a bar exhibit a significant $3.0\sigma$ surplus of
lenses relative to their blue/red analogues. The existence of such structures
rules out violent transformative events as the primary end-of-life evolutionary
mechanism, with a more passive scenario the favoured candidate for the majority
of galaxies rapidly transitioning across the green valley.

energy, possibly indicative of a surface peroxide species. A downward band
bending of 0.4 eV is observed for the reduced surface, while the band bending

of an implementation in the code. This does not integrate well with the error
handling of MPI, which more or less always results in program termination in
case of MPI failures. In particular, a local C++ exception can currently lead
to a deadlock due to unfinished communication requests on remote hosts. At the
same time, future MPI implementations are expected to include an API to
continue computations even after a hard fault (node loss), i.e. the worst
possible unexpected behaviour.
  In this paper we present an approach that adds extended exception propagation
support to C++ MPI programs. Our technique allows to propagate local exceptions
to remote hosts to avoid deadlocks, and to map MPI failures on remote hosts to
local exceptions. A use case of particular interest are asynchronous 'local
failure local recovery' resilience approaches. Our prototype implementation
uses MPI-3.0 features only. In addition we present a dedicated implementation,
which integrates seamlessly with MPI-ULFM, i.e. the most prominent proposal for
extending MPI towards fault tolerance.

classically, we compute that the collision energy indeed reaches below the
quantum limit for a perfect linear Paul trap. We analyze the effect of
imperfections in the ion trap that cause excess micromotion. We find that the
suppression of excess micromotion required to reach the quantum limit should be
within experimental reach. Indeed, although the requirements are strong, they
are not excessive and lie within reported values in the literature. We analyze
the detection and suppression of excess micromotion in our experimental setup.
Using the obtained experimental parameters in our simulation, we calculate
collision energies that are a factor 2-11 larger than the quantum limit,
indicating that improvements in micromotion detection and compensation are
needed there. We also analyze the buffer-gas cooling of linear and
two-dimensional ion crystals. We find that the energy stored in the eigenmodes
of ion motion may reach 10-100 $\mu$K after buffer-gas cooling under realistic
experimental circumstances. Interestingly, not all eigenmodes are buffer-gas

the stellar velocity dispersion of quiescent galaxies as an observational probe
of dark matter halo velocity dispersion and mass. Stellar velocity dispersion
is proportional to dark matter halo velocity dispersion for both central and
satellite galaxies. The dark matter halos of central galaxies are in virial
equilibrium and thus the stellar velocity dispersion is also proportional to
dark matter halo mass. This proportionality holds even when a line-of-sight
aperture dispersion is calculated in analogy to observations. In contrast, at a
given stellar velocity dispersion, the dark matter halo mass of satellite
galaxies is smaller than virial equilibrium expectations. This deviation from
virial equilibrium probably results from tidal stripping of the outer dark
matter halo. Stellar velocity dispersion appears insensitive to tidal effects
and thus reflects the correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and dark
matter halo mass prior to infall. There is a tight relation (<0.2 dex scatter)
between line-of-sight aperture stellar velocity dispersion and dark matter halo
mass suggesting that the dark matter halo mass may be estimated from the
measured stellar velocity dispersion for both central and satellite galaxies.
We evaluate the impact of treating all objects as central galaxies if the
relation we derive is applied to a statistical ensemble. A large fraction
(>2/3) of massive quiescent galaxies are central galaxies and systematic
uncertainty in the inferred dark matter halo mass is <0.1 dex thus simplifying
application of the simulation results to currently available observations.

information processing, which promises capabilities in computing, simulation,
secure communication, and metrology beyond what is possible for classical
devices. Exactly quantifying the entanglement of an unknown system requires
completely determining its quantum state, a task which demands an intractable
number of measurements even for modestly-sized systems. Here we demonstrate a
method for rigorously quantifying high-dimensional entanglement from extremely
limited data. We improve an entropic, quantitative entanglement witness to
operate directly on compressed experimental data acquired via an adaptive,
multilevel sampling procedure. Only $6,456$ measurements are needed to certify
an entanglement-of-formation of $7.11 \pm .04$ ebits shared by two
spatially-entangled photons. With a Hilbert space exceeding 68 billion
dimensions, we need $20$-million-times fewer measurements than the uncompressed
approach and $10^{18}$-times fewer measurements than tomography. Our technique
offers a universal method for quantifying entanglement in any large quantum
system shared by two parties.

conductivity induced by a magnetic field in the vicinity of a metal-insulator
transition and has inspired extensive studies for decades\cite{Ramirez1997,
Tokura2006}. Here we demonstrate an analogous spin effect near the N\'eel
temperature $T_{\rm{N}}$=296 K of the antiferromagnetic insulator \CrO. Using a
yttrium iron garnet \YIG/\CrO/Pt trilayer, we injected a spin current from the
YIG into the \CrO layer, and collected via the inverse spin Hall effect the
signal transmitted in the heavy metal Pt. We observed a change by two orders of
magnitude in the transmitted spin current within 14 K of the N\'eel
temperature. This transition between spin conducting and nonconducting states
could be also modulated by a magnetic field in isothermal conditions. This
effect, that we term spin colossal magnetoresistance (SCMR), has the potential
to simplify the design of fundamental spintronics components, for instance
enabling the realization of spin current switches or spin-current based
memories.

Ba(Zn$_{0.944}$Mn$_{0.056}$)$_2$P$_2$ with only spin doping, due to the
superexchange interaction between Mn atoms and the lack of itinerant carriers,
the short-range antiferromagnetic coupling dominates. Partially substituting K
atoms for Ba atoms, which introduces itinerant hole carriers into the $p$
orbitals of P atoms so as to link distant Mn moments with the spin-polarized
hole carriers via the $p$-$d$ hybridization between P and Mn atoms, is very
crucial for the appearance of ferromagnetism in the compound. Furthermore,
applying hydrostatic pressure first enhances and then decreases the
ferromagnetic coupling in
(Ba$_{0.75}$K$_{0.25}$)(Zn$_{0.944}$Mn$_{0.056}$)$_2$P$_2$ at a turning point
around 15 GPa, which results from the combined effects of the pressure-induced

walks with respect to continuous deformations preserving unitarity, locality,
translation invariance, a gap condition, and some symmetry of the tenfold way.
The classification largely matches the one recently obtained (arXiv:1611.04439)
for a similar setting leaving out translation invariance. However, the
translation invariant case has some finer distinctions, because some walks may
be connected only by breaking translation invariance along the way, retaining
only invariance by an even number of sites. Similarly, if walks are considered
equivalent when they differ only by adding a trivial walk, i.e., one that
allows no jumps between cells, then the classification collapses also to the
general one. The indices of the general classification can be computed in
practice only for walks closely related to some translation invariant ones. We
prove a completed collection of simple formulas in terms of winding numbers of
band structures covering all symmetry types. Furthermore, we determine the
strength of the locality conditions, and show that the continuity of the band
structure, which is a minimal requirement for topological classifications in
terms of winding numbers to make sense, implies the compactness of the
commutator of the walk with a half-space projection, a condition which was also
the basis of the general theory. In order to apply the theory to the joining of
large but finite bulk pieces, one needs to determine the asymptotic behaviour
of a stationary Schr\""odinger equation. We show exponential behaviour, and give
a practical method for computing the decay constants.

a precise degradation model is known. As the degradation process can only be
partially known or inaccurately modeled, images may not be well restored. Rain
streak removal and image deconvolution with inaccurate blur kernels are two
representative examples of such tasks. For rain streak removal, although an
input image can be decomposed into a scene layer and a rain streak layer, there
exists no explicit formulation for modeling rain streaks and the composition
with scene layer. For blind deconvolution, as estimation error of blur kernel
is usually introduced, the subsequent non-blind deconvolution process does not
restore the latent image well. In this paper, we propose a principled algorithm
within the maximum a posterior framework to tackle image restoration with a
partially known or inaccurate degradation model. Specifically, the residual
caused by a partially known or inaccurate degradation model is spatially
dependent and complexly distributed. With a training set of degraded and
ground-truth image pairs, we parameterize and learn the fidelity term for a
degradation model in a task-driven manner. Furthermore, the regularization term
can also be learned along with the fidelity term, thereby forming a
simultaneous fidelity and regularization learning model. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for image
deconvolution with inaccurate blur kernels, deconvolution with multiple

new time series of high-resolution spectra with the aim to derive improved
stellar and system parameters, to search for the possible impact of a third
component in the observed spectra, to look for indications of activity in the
Algol system, and to search for short-term variations in radial velocities. We
disentangled the composite spectra into the spectra of the binary components.
Then we analysed the resulting high signal-to-noise spectra of both stars.
Using a newly developed program code based on an improved method of
least-squares deconvolution, we were able to determine the radial velocities of
both components also during primary eclipse. This allowed us to develop a
better model of the system including the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and to
derive improved orbital parameters. Combining the results with those from
spectrum analysis, we obtain accurate stellar and system parameters. We further
deduce at least one oscillation frequency of 21.38 c/d. It could be detected
during primary eclipses only and confirms a previous photometric finding.
Results point to an amplitude amplification of non-radial pulsation modes due
to the eclipse mapping effect. The presence of a He\,I line in the spectra
indicates mass transfer in the R CMa system. Calculations of its Roche geometry
give evidence that the cool secondary component may fill its Roche lobe. No
evidence of a third body in the system could be found in the observed spectra.

the one hand, most distributed energy resources (DER) are converter-interfaced

current inertia emulation approach cannot provide guaranteed response. In this
paper, a model reference control based inertia emulation strategy is proposed
for diesel-wind systems. Desired inertia can be precisely emulated through the
proposed strategy. A typical frequency response model with parametric inertia
is set to be the reference model. A measurement at a specific location delivers
the information about the disturbance acting on the diesel-wind system to the
reference model. The objective is for the speed of the diesel generator to
track the reference so that the desired inertial response is realized. In
addition, polytopic parameter uncertainty will be considered. The control
strategy is configured in different ways according to different operating
points. The parameters of the reference model are scheduled to ensure adequate
frequency response under a pre-defined worst case. The controller is
implemented in a nonlinear three-phase diesel-wind system fed microgrid using
the Simulink software platform. The results show that exact synthetic inertia

two galaxies passed each other with a pericenter distance of 37 kpc. Tides
excited a two-armed spiral structure in the M33 disk, which is found to be the
predominant spiral signal in the observed galaxy and has been long known as a
feature easily induced by tidal interactions. We found that the gaseous warp
produced by the interaction did not resemble enough the observed one and we
performed an additional simulation including the hot gas halo of M31 to show
that this feature can be properly reproduced by tidal forces and ram pressure
stripping acting simultaneously on the gaseous disk. In addition to the spiral
arms, tidal forces produced the stellar stream similar to the observed one and
triggered a star formation burst at similar radii as it is observed.

While constant step size theory was established in the 1950's, zero stability
on nonuniform grids is less well understood. Here we investigate zero stability
on compact intervals and smooth nonuniform grids. In practical computations,
step size control can be implemented using smooth (small) step size changes.
The resulting grid $\{t_n\}_{n=0}^N$ can be modeled as the image of an
equidistant grid under a smooth deformation map, i.e., $t_n = \Phi(\tau_n)$,
where $\tau_n = n/N$ and the map $\Phi$ is monotonically increasing with
$\Phi(0)=0$ and $\Phi(1)=1$. The model is justified for any fixed order method
operating in its asymptotic regime when applied to smooth problems, since the
step size is then determined by the (smooth) principal error function which
determines $\Phi$, and a tolerance requirement which determines $N$. Given any
strongly stable multistep method, there is an $N^*$ such that the method is
zero stable for $N>N^*$, provided that $\Phi \in C^2[0,1]$. Thus zero stability
holds on all nonuniform grids such that adjacent step sizes satisfy
$h_n/h_{n-1} = 1 + \mathrm O(N^{-1})$ as $N\rightarrow\infty$. The results are

test based on the t distribution by modifying and extending Guenther's (1981)
approach for the one sample and two sample t tests. The generalized procedure
is employed to determine the sample size for treatment comparisons using the
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and the mixed effects model for repeated
measures (MMRM) in randomized clinical trials. The sample size is calculated by
adding a few simple correction terms to the sample size from the normal
approximation to account for the nonnormality of the t statistic and lower
order variance terms, which are functions of the covariates in the model. But
it does not require specifying the covariate distribution. The noniterative
procedure is suitable for superiority tests, noninferiority tests and a special
case of the tests for equivalence or bioequivalence, and generally yields the
exact or nearly exact sample size estimate after rounding to an integer. The
method for calculating the exact power of the two sample t test with unequal
variance in superiority trials is extended to equivalence trials. We also
derive accurate power formulae for ANCOVA and MMRM, and the formula for ANCOVA
is exact for normally distributed covariates. Numerical examples demonstrate
the accuracy of the proposed methods particularly in small samples.

both dynamic and thermodynamic nature. Some studies indicate the presence of
thermodynamic anomalies and of crossovers in the dynamic properties, but their
origin and degree of universality is difficult to assess. Moreover,
conventional simulations are barely able to cover the range of temperatures at
which these crossovers usually occur. To address these issues, we simulate the
Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones mixture using efficient protocols based on multi-CPU
and multi-GPU parallel tempering. Our setup enables us to probe the
thermodynamics and dynamics of the liquid at equilibrium well below the
critical temperature of mode-coupling theory, $T_{\rm MCT} = 0.435$. We find
that below $T=0.4$ the analysis is hampered by partial crystallization of the
metastable liquid, which nucleates extended regions populated by large
particles arranged in an fcc structure. By filtering out crystalline samples,
we reveal that the specific heat grows in a regular manner down to $T=0.38$.
Possible thermodynamic anomalies suggested by previous studies can thus occur
only in a region of the phase diagram where the system is highly metastable.
Using the equilibrium configurations obtained from the parallel tempering
simulations, we perform molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations to probe
the equilibrium dynamics down to $T=0.4$. A temperature-derivative analysis of
the relaxation time and diffusion data allows us to assess different dynamic
scenarios around $T_{\rm MCT}$. Hints of a dynamic crossover come from analysis
of the four-point dynamic susceptibility. Finally, we discuss possible future
numerical strategies to clarify the nature of crossover phenomena in
glass-forming liquids.

number of environmental applications dealing with contaminant dispersion and
passive scalar mixing. The aim of the present study is to extend the
observations available in the literature on relative dispersion of fluid
particle pairs to wall-bounded turbulent flows, by means of particle pair
tracking in direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow. The
mean-square change of separation between particle pairs follows a clear
ballistic regime at short times for all wall distances. The Eulerian structure
functions governing this short-time separation are characterised in the
channel, and allow to define a characteristic time scale for the ballistic
regime, as well as a suitable normalisation of the mean-square separation
leading to an overall collapse for different wall distances. Through fluid
particle pair tracking backwards and forwards in time, the temporal asymmetry
of relative dispersion is illustrated. At short times, this asymmetry is linked
to the irreversibility of turbulence, as in previous studies on homogeneous
isotropic flows. The influence of the initial separation (distance and
orientation) as well as the influence of mean shear are addressed. By
decomposing the mean-square separation into the dispersion by the fluctuating
velocity field and by the average velocity, it is shown that the influence of
mean shear becomes important at early stages of dispersion close to the wall
but also near the channel centre. The relative dispersion tensor $\Delta_{ij}$
is also presented and particularly the sign and time evolution of the
cross-term $\Delta_{xy}$ are discussed. Finally, a ballistic cascade model
previously proposed for homogeneous isotropic turbulence is adapted here to
turbulent channel flows. Preliminary results are given and compared to the DNS.

thermodynamic stability, electronic and magnetic properties. The emerging
picture suggests that, under thermodynamic equilibrium, 1$T'$-MoS$_2$ is more
prone to hosting lattice imperfections than the 2$H$ phase. More specifically,
our findings reveal that the S atoms that are closer to the Mo atomic plane are
the most reactive sites. Similarly to the 2$H$ phase, S vacancies and adatoms
in 1$T'$-MoS$_2$ are very likely to occur while Mo adatoms and antisites induce
local magnetic moments. Contrary to the 2$H$ phase, Mo vacancies in
1$T'$-MoS$_2$ are expected to be an abundant defect due to the structural
relaxation that plays a major role in lowering the defect formation energy.

derive assumption-free and exact solution methods for each one. We extend a
goodness-of-fit metric previously introduced for the problem with a single
observed decision to this new setting, and demonstrate several important
properties. Finally, we demonstrate our framework in a novel inverse
optimization-driven procedure for automated radiation therapy treatment
planning. Here, the inverse optimization model leverages an ensemble of dose
predictions from different machine learning models to construct a consensus
treatment plan that outperforms baseline methods. The consensus plan yields
better trade-offs between the competing clinical criteria used for plan

feature-based aggregation with feature construction using deep neural networks

approximated much more accurately by the nonlinear function of the features

by neural network-based reinforcement learning, thereby potentially leading to
more effective policy improvement.

extra degrees of freedom by treating the real and imaginary components of the

linear beamforming for waveform generation, we highlight the benefits of widely
linear beamforming over multiple temporal dimensions (symbol extension in time)
in the IMAC. This scheme achieves significantly higher information rates
compared to conventional proper Gaussian signaling at the expense of extra
complexity at the transmission phase. We study the sum-power minimization
problem under rate constraints. This problem is a difference of concave
functions (DC) program, hence, a non-convex problem. By numerical simulations,
we observe the benefits of improper Gaussian signaling alongside symbol
extension in power consumption for both single-antenna and multi-antenna base
stations. Interestingly, we observe that at strong interference scenarios, the
efficiency of improper Gaussian signaling outperforms conventional proper
Gaussian signaling at low rate demands. Moreover, in such scenarios the
sum-power required for achieving particular rate demands is significantly
reduced.

traditionally treated as a geometrical problem. Although geometrical methods
have been proven effective with regard to finding infinitesimal symmetry
transformations, they present certain conceptual difficulties in the case of
matrix-valued PDEs; for example, the usual differential-operator representation
of the symmetry-generating vector fields is not possible in this case. An
algebraic approach to the symmetry problem of PDEs is described, based on
abstract operators (characteristic derivatives) which admit a standard
differential-operator representation in the case of scalar-valued PDEs.

pragmatically for the Planck scale quantum features of spacetime. Among these
features is the existence of a characteristic length scale addressed commonly
by effective approaches to quantum gravity (QG). This characteristic length
scale could be realized, for instance and simply, by generalizing the standard
Heisenberg uncertainty principle (HUP) to a \emph{""generalized uncertainty
principle""} (GUP). While usually it is expected that phenomena belonging to the
realm of QG are essentially probable solely at the so-called Planck energy,
here we show how a GUP proposal containing the most general modification of
coordinate representation of the momentum operator could be probed by a
\emph{""cold atomic ensemble recoil experiment""} (CARE) as a low energy quantum
system. This proposed atomic interferometer setup has advantages over the
conventional architectures owing to the enclosure in a high finesse optical
cavity which is supported by a new class of low power consumption integrated
devices known as \emph{""micro-electro-opto-mechanical systems""} (MEOMS). The
proposed system comprises of a micro mechanical oscillator instead of spherical
confocal mirrors as one of the components of high finesse optical cavity. In
the framework of a bottom-up QG phenomenological viewpoint and by taking into
account the measurement accuracy realized for the fine structure constant (FSC)
from the Rubidium ($^{87}$Rb) CARE, we set some constraints as upper bounds on
the characteristic parameters of the underlying GUP. In the case of
superposition of the possible GUP modification terms, we managed to set a tight
constraint as $0.999978<\lambda_0<1.00002$ for the dimensionless characteristic
parameter.

more types of multipole terms than it is conventionally perceived. The toroidal

studied in recent years. Here we inspect more closely the other type of

discuss both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the mean-square radii and

terms of comfort and convenience and, in particular, the safety of the
autonomous vehicle. Safety functions in autonomous vehicles such as Automatic
Emergency Braking and Lane Centering Assist rely on computation, information
sharing, and the timely actuation of the safety functions. One opportunity to
achieve robust autonomous vehicle safety is by enhancing the robustness of
in-vehicle networking architectures that support built-in resiliency
mechanisms. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an advanced networking
paradigm that allows fine-grained manipulation of routing tables and routing
engines and the implementation of complex features such as failover, which is a
mechanism of protecting in-vehicle networks from failure, and in which a
standby link automatically takes over once the main link fails. In this paper,
we leverage SDN network programmability features to enable resiliency in the
autonomous vehicle realm. We demonstrate that a Software Defined In-Vehicle
Networking (SDIVN) does not add overhead compared to Legacy In-Vehicle Networks
(LIVNs) under non-failure conditions and we highlight its superiority in the
case of a link failure and its timely delivery of messages. We verify the
proposed architectures benefits using a simulation environment that we have
developed and we validate our design choices through testing and simulations

  Channels","Paper revised",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To overcome the limitations of DSRC with short range, non-supportability of
high density networks, unreliable broadcast services, signal congestion and
connectivity disruptions, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication
networks, standardized in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 14,
have been recently introduced to cover broader vehicular communication
scenarios including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) and
vehicle-to-infrastructure/network (V2I/N). In C-V2X, vehicles can directly
communicate over PC5 based dedicated sidelinks called direct mode or V2V
communication. However, high vehicle densities may require reuse of cellular
spectrum for V2V. Moreover, infrastructure mode communication through V2I/N
links can augment V2V communication by enhancing communication range and
reliability for enhanced safety along with consistent performance under traffic
congestions. Motivated by the stringent connection reliability, spectral
efficiency, and coverage requirements in C-V2X, this paper presents the first
comprehensive and tractable analytical framework for performance of C-V2X
networks over shared V2V and cellular uplink channels, where the transmitting
vehicles can deliver their information via infrastructure or direct mode, based
on their distances, propagation environments and the bias factor. By
practically modeling the vehicles on the roads using the doubly stochastic Cox
process and the base-stations, we derive new association probabilities, new
success probabilities of infrastructure and direct mode, and overall success
probability of the C-V2X communication over shared channels, which are
validated by the simulations results. Our results reveal the benefits of our
proposed model (possibility of selecting both direct and infrastructure modes
over shared channels) compared to V2V network in terms of success probability.
