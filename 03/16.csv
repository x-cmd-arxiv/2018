introduction of effective and generalizable deep learning frameworks such as
pointnet++. Thus far, however, point features have been abstracted in an
independent and isolated manner, ignoring the relative layout of neighboring
points as well as their features. In the present article, we propose to
overcome this limitation by using spectral graph convolution on a local graph,
combined with a novel graph pooling strategy. In our approach, graph
convolution is carried out on a nearest neighbor graph constructed from a
point's neighborhood, such that features are jointly learned. We replace the
standard max pooling step with a recursive clustering and pooling strategy,
devised to aggregate information from within clusters of nodes that are close
to one another in their spectral coordinates, leading to richer overall feature

consistent demonstrable advantage for the tasks of both point set

matter systems under general non-equilibrium conditions is proposed. In this
method interaction between nuclei and electrons is considered explicitly up to
the second order in atomic displacements defined with respect to the mean
atomic trajectory. This method enables one to consider movement of atoms beyond
their simple vibrations. Both electrons and nuclei are treated fully
quantum-mechanically using a combination of path integrals applied to nuclei
and non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) to elections. Our method is
partition-less: initially, the entire system is coupled and assumed to be at
thermal equilibrium. Then, the exact application of the Hubbard-Stratanovich
transformation in mixed real and imaginary times enables us to obtain, without
doing any additional approximations, an exact expression for the reduced
density matrix for nuclei and hence an effective quantum Liouville equation for
them, both containing Gaussian noises. It is shown that the time evolution of
the expectation values for atomic positions is described by an infinite
hierarchy of stochastic differential equations for atomic positions and momenta
and their various fluctuations. The actual dynamics is obtained by sampling all
stochastic trajectories. It is expected that applications of the method may
include photo-induced chemical reactions (e.g. dissociation), electromigration,
atomic manipulation in scanning tunneling microscopy, to name just a few.

energy-momentum tensor. Since these fields also carry a non-trivial
energy-momentum tensor, the coupling prescription generates self-interactions.
In analogy with gravity theories, we built the action by means of an iterative
process that leads to an infinite series, which can be resumed as the solution
of a set of differential equations. We show that, in some particular cases, the
equations become algebraic and that is also possible to find solutions in the
form of polynomials. We briefly review the case of the scalar field that has
already been studied in the literature and extend the analysis to the case of
derivative (disformal) couplings. We then explore theories with vector fields,
distinguishing between gauge- and non-gauge-invariant couplings. Interactions
with matter are also considered, taking a scalar field as a proxy for the
matter sector. We also discuss the ambiguity introduced by superpotential
(boundary) terms in the definition of the energy-momentum tensor and use them
to show that it is also possible to generate Galileon-like interactions with
this procedure. We finally use collider and astrophysical observations to set
constraints on the dimensionful coupling which characterises the phenomenology
of these models.

International Space Station (ISS) in August, 2015, has been accumulating
scientific data since October, 2015. CALET is intended to perform long-duration
observations of high-energy cosmic rays onboard the ISS. CALET directly
measures the cosmic-ray electron spectrum in the energy range of 1 GeV to 20
TeV with a 2% energy resolution above 30 GeV. In addition, the instrument can
measure the spectrum of gamma rays well into the TeV range, and the spectra of
protons and nuclei up to a PeV.
  In order to operate the CALET onboard ISS, JAXA Ground Support Equipment
(JAXA-GSE) and the Waseda CALET Operations Center (WCOC) have been established.
Scientific operations using CALET are planned at WCOC, taking into account
orbital variations of geomagnetic rigidity cutoff. Scheduled command sequences
are used to control the CALET observation modes on orbit. Calibration data
acquisition by, for example, recording pedestal and penetrating particle
events, a low-energy electron trigger mode operating at high geomagnetic
latitude, a low-energy gamma-ray trigger mode operating at low geomagnetic
latitude, and an ultra heavy trigger mode, are scheduled around the ISS orbit
while maintaining maximum exposure to high-energy electrons and other
high-energy shower events by always having the high-energy trigger mode active.
The WCOC also prepares and distributes CALET flight data to collaborators in
Italy and the United States.
  As of August 31, 2017, the total observation time is 689 days with a live
time fraction of the total time of approximately 84%. Nearly 450 million events
are collected with a high-energy (E>10 GeV) trigger. By combining all operation
modes with the excellent-quality on-orbit data collected thus far, it is
expected that a five-year observation period will provide a wealth of new and
interesting results.

approach which exploits the measurement uncertainties in a natural way. In
particular the comparison of temperature and humdity radiosonde measurements
collected within RAOB network and the corresponding atmospheric profiles
derived from IASI interferometers aboard of Metop-A and Metop-B satellites is
developed with the aim of understanding the vertical smoothing mismatch
uncertainty. Moreover, conventional RAOB functional data representation is
assessed by means of a comparison with radiosonde reference measurements given
by GRUAN network, which provides high resolution fully traceable radiosouding
profiles. In this way the uncertainty related to coarse vertical resolution, or
sparseness, of conventional RAOB is assessed. It has been found that the
uncertainty of vertical smoothing mismatch averaged along the profile is 0.50 K
for temperature and 0.16 g/kg for water vapour mixing ratio. Moreover the
uncertainty related to RAOB sparseness, averaged along the profile is 0.29 K
for temperature and 0.13 g/kg for water vapour mixing ratio.

radiation damage, which forms the basis for single-particle electron microscopy
and related techniques, is to distribute the dose over many identical copies of
an object. For the acquisition of low-dose data, ideally no dose should be
applied to the region of interest prior to the acquisition of data. We present
an automated approach that can collect large amounts of data efficiently by
acquiring images in an user-defined area-of-interest with atomic resolution. We
demonstrate that the stage mechanics of the Nion UltraSTEM, combined with an
intelligent algorithm to move the sample, allows the automated acquisition of
atomically resolved images from micron-sized areas of a graphene substrate.
Moving the sample stage automatically in a regular pattern over the
area-of-interest enables the collection of data from pristine sample regions
without exposing them to the electron beam before recording an image.
Therefore, it is possible to obtain data with minimal dose (no prior exposure
from focusing), which is only limited by the minimum signal needed for data
processing. This enables us to prevent beam induced damage in the sample and to
acquire large datasets within a reasonable amount of time.

density of states which enhances the effects of interactions, and may lead to

bosonic systems. Here we show that in dilute, homogeneous bosonic systems above
one dimension, weak, spin-independent, inter-particle interactions stabilize a
metallic state at zero temperature in the presence of a curved manifold of
dispersion minima. In this metallic phase the system possesses a quasi
long-range order with non-universal scaling exponents. At a fixed positive
curvature of the manifold, increasing either the dilution or the interaction
strength destabilizes the metallic state towards charge density wave states
that break one or more symmetries. The magnitude of the wave vector of the

for understanding cognitive information processes. However, access to the
dynamic processes underlying cognition is limited to indirect measurements of

the network structure of the underlying process is challenging. In this
article, we embed an adaptive importance sampler called Adaptive Path Integral
Smoother (APIS) into the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to obtain point
estimates of causal connectivity. We demonstrate on synthetic data that this
procedure finds not only the correct network structure but also the direction
of effective connections from random initializations of the connectivity
matrix. In addition--motivated by contradictory claims in the literature--we
examine the effect of the neuronal timescale on the sensitivity of the BOLD
signal to changes in the connectivity and on the maximum likelihood solutions
of the connectivity. We conclude with two warnings: First, the connectivity
estimates under the assumption of slow dynamics can be extremely biased if the
data was generated by fast neuronal processes. Second, the faster the time
scale, the less sensitive the BOLD signal is to changes in the incoming
connections to a node. Hence, connectivity estimation using realistic neural
dynamics timescale requires extremely high-quality data and seems infeasible in
many practical data sets.

turbo receiver, forward error correction (FEC) code is only used at decoder.
Nonetheless, by taking advantage of FEC code in the detection stage, our
proposed SDR detector can output extrinsic information with much improved
reliability to the decoder. We also propose a simplified SDR turbo receiver
that solves only one SDR problem per codeword instead of solving multiple SDR
problems in the iterative turbo processing. This scheme significantly reduces
the time complexity of SDR turbo receiver, while the error performance remains
similar as before. In fact, our simplified scheme is generic in the sense that
it is applicable to any list-based iterative receivers.

line overloading and voltage violations, improve system reliability, and reduce
system losses. Power grid optimization by means of line switching is typically
formulated as a mixed integer programming problem (MIP). Such problems are
known to be computationally intractable, and accordingly, a number of heuristic
approaches to grid topology reconfiguration have been proposed in the power
systems literature. By means of some low order examples (3-bus systems), it is
shown that within a reasonably large class of greedy heuristics, none can be
found that perform better than the others across all grid topologies. Despite
this cautionary tale, statistical evidence based on a large number of
simulations using using IEEE 118- bus systems indicates that among three
heuristics, a globally greedy heuristic is the most computationally intensive,
but has the best chance of reducing generation costs while enforcing N-1
connectivity. It is argued that, among all iterative methods, the locally
optimal switches at each stage have a better chance in not only approximating a
global optimal solution but also greatly limiting the number of lines that are
switched.

alternating between regeneration and optimization steps. Finally, we describe a

expands by a factor of more than 2. Along the entire evolution the convection
can carry the energy very efficiently outwards, to the radius where radiative

providing access to detailed geocoding information for external researchers,
without compromising the confidentiality of the units included in the database.
Our work was motivated by a recent project at the Institute for Employment
Research (IAB) in Germany that linked exact geocodes to the Integrated
Employment Biographies (IEB), a large administrative database containing
several million records. We evaluate the performance of three synthesizers
regarding the trade-off between preserving analytical validity and limiting
disclosure risks: One synthesizer employs Dirichlet Process mixtures of
products of multinomials (DPMPM), while the other two use different versions of
Classification and Regression Trees (CART). In terms of preserving analytical
validity, our proposed synthesis strategy for geocodes based on categorical
CART models outperforms the other two. If the risks of the synthetic data
generated by the categorical CART synthesizer are deemed too high, we
demonstrate that synthesizing additional variables is the preferred strategy to
address the risk-utility trade-off in practice, compared to limiting the size
of the regression trees or relying on the strategy of providing geographical
information only on an aggregated level. We also propose strategies for making
the synthesizers scalable for large files, present analytical validity measures
and disclosure risk measures for the generated data, and provide general
recommendations for statistical agencies considering the synthetic data
approach for disseminating detailed geographical information.

nodes exchange their updates (gradients) indirectly after every log(p) steps,
3) rotation of communication partners for facilitating direct diffusion of

feedforward phase in SGD to prevent over-fitting, 5) asynchronous communication
of gradients for further reducing the communication cost of SGD and GossipGraD.
We implement GossipGraD for GPU and CPU clusters and use NVIDIA GPUs (Pascal
P100) connected with InfiniBand, and Intel Knights Landing (KNL) connected with

functions and are excited by known external excitation signals and/or unknown

whole network - topology and all transfer functions - from the measured node
signals and external excitation signals. So far all results on this topic have
assumed that all node signals are measured. This paper presents the first
results for the situation where not all node signals are measurable, under the
assumptions that (1) the topology of the network is known, and (2) each node is
excited by a known external excitation. Using graph theoretical properties, we
show that the transfer functions that can be identified depend essentially on
the topology of the paths linking the corresponding vertices to the measured
nodes. A practical outcome is that, under those assumptions, a network can
often be identified using only a small subset of node measurements.

Markovian noise, via strategies based on time-continuous monitoring of the
environment. Both physical intuition and an extended convexity property of the
quantum Fisher information (QFI) suggest that these strategies are more
effective than the standard ones based on the measurement of the unconditional
state after the noisy evolution. Here we focus on initial GHZ states and on
parallel or transverse noise. For parallel noise, i.e. dephasing, we show that
perfectly efficient time-continuous photo-detection allows to recover the
unitary (noiseless) QFI, and thus to obtain a Heisenberg scaling for every
value of the monitoring time. For finite detection efficiency, one falls back
to the noisy standard quantum limit scaling, but with a constant enhancement
due to an effective reduced dephasing. Also in the transverse noise case we
obtain that the Heisenberg scaling is recovered for perfectly efficient
detectors, and we find that both homodyne and photo-detection based strategies
are optimal. For finite detectors efficiency, our numerical simulations show
that, as expected, an enhancement can be observed, but we cannot give any
conclusive statement regarding the scaling. We finally describe in detail the
stable and compact numerical algorithm that we have developed in order to
evaluate the precision of such time-continuous estimation strategies, and that
may find application in other quantum metrology schemes.

as $F_\nu\propto\nu^{-0.6}t^{0.8}$ with observed frequency and time, consistent
with a single power-law segment of the synchrotron spectrum from the external
shock going into the ambient medium. This requires the effective isotropic
equivalent afterglow shock energy in the visible region to increase as $\sim
t^{1.7}$. The two main channels for such an energy increase are (i)
\emph{radial}: more energy carried by slower material (in the visible region)
gradually catches up with the afterglow shock and energizes it, and (ii)
\emph{angular}: more energy in relativistic outflow moving at different angles
to our line of sight, whose radiation is initially beamed away from us but its
beaming cone gradually reaches our line of sight as it decelerates. One cannot
distinguish between these explanations (or combinations of them) using only the
X-ray to radio $F_\nu(t)$. Here we demonstrate that the most promising way to

flux centroid) and linear polarization $\Pi(t)$ for different angular and/or
radial outflow structures that fit $F_\nu(t)$. We consider two angular profiles
-- a Gaussian and a narrow core with power-law wings in energy per solid angle,
as well as a (cocoon motivated) (quasi-) spherical flow with radial velocity
profile. For a jet viewed off-axis (and a magnetic field produced in the
afterglow shock) $\Pi(t)$ peaks when the jet's core becomes visible, at
$\approx2t_p$ where the lightcurve peaks at $t_p$, and the image can be
elongated with aspect ratios$\;\gtrsim2$. A quasi-spherical flow has an almost
circular image and a much lower $\Pi(t)$ (peaking at $\approx t_p$) and flux
centroid displacement.

the famous Noether-Castelnuovo theorem, every birational transformation $f$ is
a product of Jonqui\`eres transformations. The minimal number of factors in
such a product will be called the length, and written $\mathrm{lgth}(f)$. Even

  As an application of this computation, we give a few properties of the

relates each local processor's outputs to its inputs. This paper uses a recent
advance in the foundations of information theory to study the properties of
local processors that use contextual input to amplify or attenuate transmission
of information about their driving inputs. This advance enables the information
transmitted by processors with two distinct inputs to be decomposed into those
components unique to each input, that shared between the two inputs, and that
which depends on both though it is in neither, i.e. synergy. The decompositions
that we report here show that contextual modulation has information processing
properties that contrast with those of all four simple arithmetic operators,
that it can take various forms, and that the form used in our previous studies
of artificial neural nets composed of local processors with both driving and
contextual inputs is particularly well-suited to provide the distinctive
capabilities of contextual modulation under a wide range of conditions. We
argue that the decompositions reported here could be compared with those
obtained from empirical neurobiological and psychophysical data under
conditions thought to reflect contextual modulation. That would then shed new
light on the underlying processes involved. Finally, we suggest that such
decompositions could aid the design of context-sensitive machine learning

neutrino-nucleon cross section is large enough so that the neutrino mean-free
path in a medium with the Earth's density is comparable to the Earth's

a non-negligible probability for them to be absorbed. Since this effect depends
on the distance traveled by neutrinos and on their energy, studying the zenith

evolution of Ly$\alpha$ and LIS absorption kinematics, and fine-structure
emission EWs. The connections among the strengths of Ly$\alpha$, LIS lines, and
dust extinction are redshift-independent, as is the decoupling of Ly$\alpha$

Stronger Ly$\alpha$ emission is observed at higher redshift at fixed UV
luminosity, stellar mass, SFR, and age. Much of this variation in average
Ly$\alpha$ strength with redshift, and the variation in Ly$\alpha$ strength at
fixed redshift, can be explained in terms of variations in neutral gas covering

find evidence for variations in the intrinsic production rate of Ly$\alpha$

themselves. As such they are intrinsically nonlinear phenomena and are much
more complex than linear counterparts such as the vacuum or MSW oscillations.
They obey integro-differential equations, numerical solutions of which are also
very challenging. If one focuses on the onset of the collective oscillations,
on the other hand, the equations can be linearized and the technique of linear
analysis can be employed. Unfortunately, however, it is well known that such an
analysis, when applied with discretizations of continuous angular
distributions, suffers from the appearance of so-called spurious modes,
unphysical eigenmodes of the discretized linear equations. In this paper, we
analyze in detail the origin of these unphysical modes and present a simple
solution to this annoying problem. We have found that the spurious modes
originate from the artificial production of pole singularities instead of a
branch cut in the Riemann surface by the discretizations. The branching point
singularities in the Riemann surface for the original undiscretized equations
can be recovered by approximating the angular distributions with polynomials
and then performing the integrals analytically. We demonstrate for some
examples that this simple prescription removes the spurious modes indeed. We
also propose an even simpler method: a piecewise linear approximation to the
angular distribution. It is shown that the same methodology is applicable to
the multi-energy case as well as to the dispersion relation approach that was
proposed very recently.

CO(3-2) line and far-infrared continuum emission from a galaxy associated with
a high-metallicity ([M/H] = -0.27) damped Ly-alpha absorber (DLA) at z
=2.19289. The galaxy is located 3.5"" away from the quasar sightline,
corresponding to a large impact parameter of 30 kpc at the DLA redshift. We use
archival Very Large Telescope-SINFONI data to detect Halpha emission from the
associated galaxy, and find that the object is dusty, with a dust-corrected
star formation rate of 110 +60 -30 Msun/yr. The galaxy's molecular mass is
large, Mmol = (1.4 +- 0.2) x 10^11 x (\alpha_CO/4.3) x (0.57/r_31) Msun,
supporting the hypothesis that high-metallicity DLAs arise predominantly near
massive galaxies. The excellent agreement in redshift between the CO(3-2) line
emission and low-ion metal absorption (~40 km/s) disfavors scenarios whereby
the gas probed by the DLA shows bulk motion around the galaxy. We use Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope HI 21cm absorption spectroscopy to find that the HI
along the DLA sightline must be warm, with a stringent lower limit on the spin
temperature of T_s > 1895 x (f/0.93) K. The detection of CI absorption in the
DLA, however, also indicates the presence of cold neutral gas. To reconcile
these results requires that the cold components in the DLA contribute little to
the HI column density, yet contain roughly 50% of the metals of the absorber,
underlining the complex multi-phase nature of the gas surrounding high-z
galaxies.

Black-Hole Transient GX 339-4 during its low/hard state in August 2008. Thanks
to simultaneous high time-resolution observations made with the VLT and RXTE,
we performed the first characterisation of the sub-second variability in the
near-infrared band - and of its correlation with the X-rays - for a low-mass
X-ray binary, using both time and frequency-domain techniques. We found a
power-law correlation between the X-ray and infrared fluxes when measured on
timescales of 16 seconds, with a marginally variable slope, steeper than the
one found on timescales of days at similar flux levels. We suggest the variable
slope - if confirmed - could be due to the infrared flux being a non-constant
combination of both optically thin and optically thick synchrotron emission
from the jet, as a result of a variable self-absorption break. From cross
spectral analysis we found an approximately constant infrared time lag of
$\approx$ 0.1s, and a very high coherence of $\approx$ 90 per cent on
timescales of tens of seconds, slowly decreasing toward higher frequencies.
Finally, we report on the first detection of a linear rms-flux relation in the
emission from a low-mass X-ray binary jet, on timescales where little
correlation is found between the X-rays and the jet emission itself. This
suggests that either the inflow variations and jet IR emission are coupled by a
non-linear or time-variable transform, or that the IR rms-flux relation is not
transferred from the inflow to the jet, but is an intrinsic property of
emission processes in the jet.

explanations that have been suggested for this region, including mixing in the
late main sequence, a Li dip origin for stars with low Li abundances in the
region, and a possible relation with the presence of planets. To study the Li
desert, we measured the atmospheric parameters and Li abundance of 227 late-F
dwarfs and subgiants, chosen to be in the T_eff range of the desert and without
previous Li abundance measurements. Subsequently, we complemented those with
literature data to obtain a homogeneous catalog of 2318 stars, for which we
compute masses and ages. We characterize stars surrounding the region of the Li
desert. We conclude that stars with low Li abundances below the desert are more
massive and more evolved than stars above the desert. Given the unexpected
presence of low Li abundance stars in this effective temperature range, we
concentrate on finding their origin. We conclude that these stars with low Li
abundance do not evolve from stars above the desert: at a given mass, stars
with low Li (i.e., below the desert) are more metal-poor. Instead, we suggest
that stars below the Li desert are consistent with having evolved from the Li
dip, discarding the need to invoke additional mixing to explain this feature.
Thus, stars below the Li desert are not peculiar and are only distinguished
from other subgiants evolved from the Li dip in that their combination of
atmospheric parameters locates them in a range of effective temperatures where
otherwise only high Li abundance stars would be found (i.e., stars above the
desert).

larger than mm dust disks by a factor of two on average, likely due to a
combination of the optically thick gas emission as well as the growth and
inward drift of the dust. Using the gas disk radii, we calculate the
dimensionless viscosity parameter, alpha_visc, finding a broad distribution and
no correlations with other disk or stellar parameters, suggesting that viscous
processes have not yet established quasi-steady states in Lupus disks. By
combining our 1.33 mm continuum fluxes with our previous 890 micron continuum

$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$. The relationship between the value of $\alpha$ required and

constraints to the physical mechanisms of astro- nomical sources and to infer
properties that cannot be accessed directly. We re-investigate here one of
these scaling relations in active galactic nuclei (AGN); the so-called X-ray
variability plane (or mass-luminosity-timescale relation, McHardy et al. 2006).
This relation links the power-spectral density (PSD) break frequency with the
super-massive black hole (SMBH) mass and the bolometric luminosity. We used
available XMM -Newton observations of a sample of 22 AGN to study the PSD and
spectra in short segments within each observation. This allows us to report for
the first time that the PSD break frequency varies for each object, showing
variations in 19 out of the 22 AGN analyzed. Our analysis of the variability
plane confirms the relation between the break frequency and the SMBH mass and
finds that the obscuration along the line of sight NH (or the variations on the
obscuration using its standard deviation, $\rm{\Delta}$(NH)) is also a required
parameter, at least for the range of frequencies analyzed here
(3x10E-5-5x10E-2Hz). We constrain a new variability plane of the form:
log($\nu_{Break}$) = (-0.589$\rm{\pm}$0.005) log(MBH ) + (0.10$\rm{\pm}$0.01)
log(NH ) - (1.5$\rm{\pm}$0.3) (or
log($\nu_{Break}$)=(-0.549$\rm{\pm}$0.009)log(MBH)+(0.56$\rm{\pm}$0.06)$\rm{\Delta}$(NH)+(0.19$\rm{\pm}$0.08)).
The X-ray variability plane found by McHardy et al. (2006) is roughly recovered
when we use unobscured segments. We speculate that this behavior is well
explained if most of the reported frequencies are related to inner clouds
(within 1pc), following Kepler orbits under the gravitational field of the
SMBH.

  contact angle",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Following Gibb's interpretation of an interface as a dividing surface, we
derive a model for the microscopic dynamic contact angle by writing a force
balance for a control volume encompassing the interfaces and the contact line.
In doing so we identify that, in addition to the surface tension of respective
interfaces, the gradient of surface tension plays an important role in
determining the dynamic contact angle. This is because not only does it
contribute towards an additional force, but it also accounts for the deviation
of local surface tension from its static equilibrium value. It is shown that
this gradient in surface tension can be attributed to the convective
acceleration in the vicinity of the contact line, which in turn is a direct
result of varying degree of slip in that region. In addition, we provide
evidence that this gradient in surface tension is one of the key factors
responsible for the difference in contact angle at the leading and trailing
edge, of a steadily moving contact line. These findings are validated using
molecular dynamics simulations.

complexity class VP is closed under taking factors. A natural question in this
context is to understand if other natural classes of multivariate polynomials,
for instance, arithmetic formulas, algebraic branching programs, bounded depth
arithmetic circuits or the class VNP, are closed under taking factors.
  In this paper, we show that all factors of degree at most $\log^a n$ of
polynomials with poly(n) size depth $k$ circuits have poly(n) size circuits of
depth at most $O(k + a)$. This partially answers a question of
Shpilka-Yehudayoff and has applications to hardness-randomness tradeoffs for
bounded depth arithmetic circuits. More precisely, this shows that a
superpolynomial lower bound for bounded depth arithmetic circuits, for a family
of explicit polynomials of degree poly$(\log n)$ implies deterministic
sub-exponential time algorithms for polynomial identity testing (PIT) for
bounded depth arithmetic circuits. This is incomparable to a beautiful result
of Dvir et al., where they showed that super-polynomial lower bounds for
constant depth arithmetic circuits for any explicit family of polynomials (of
potentially high degree) implies sub-exponential time deterministic PIT for
bounded depth circuits of bounded individual degree. Thus, we remove the
""bounded individual degree"" condition in [DSY09] at the cost of strengthening
the hardness assumption to hold for polynomials of low degree.
  As direct applications of our techniques, we also show that the complexity
class VNP is closed under taking factors, thereby confirming a conjecture of
B\""urgisser and get an alternate proof of the fact (first shown by Dutta et
al.) that if a polynomial $Q$ of degree at most $d$ divides a polynomial $P$
computable by a formula of size $s$, then $Q$ has a formula of size at most
poly$(s, d^{\log d}, deg(P))$.

diffusion weighted protocols (multi-shell, large number of gradient directions)
for routine in vivo study of white matter architecture. The dimensionality of
these data sets is however often reduced to simplify statistical analysis.
While these approaches may detect large group differences, they do not fully
capitalize on all acquired image volumes. Incorporation of all available
diffusion information in the analysis however risks biasing the outcome by
outliers. Here we propose a statistical analysis method operating on the ODF,
either the diffusion ODF or fiber ODF. To avoid outlier bias and reliably
detect voxelwise group differences and correlations with demographic or
behavioral variables, we apply the Low-Rank plus Sparse (L + S) matrix
decomposition on the voxelwise ODFs which separates the sparse individual
variability in the sparse matrix S whilst recovering the essential ODF features
in the low-rank matrix L. We demonstrate the performance of this ODF L + S
approach by replicating the established negative association between global
white matter integrity and physical obesity in the Human Connectome dataset.
The volume of positive findings agrees with and expands on the volume found by
TBSS, Connectivity based fixel enhancement and Connectometry. In the same
dataset we further localize the correlations of brain structure with
neurocognitive measures such as fluid intelligence and episodic memory. The
presented ODF L + S approach will aid in the full utilization of all acquired
diffusion weightings leading to the detection of smaller group differences in
clinically relevant settings as well as in neuroscience applications.

of some stochastic process, from a finite set of possible monomer types. The

separate adaptive model is used to define the objective function, which
utilizes least square online parameter estimators for adaption. By having two

constraint handling, while adapting to them to improve control performance.
Furthermore, to be able implement the designed AT-NMPC in real-time, a

or small robotic agents in complex environments. A beacon is a fixed point with
an attraction pull that can move points within a given polygon. Points move
greedily towards a beacon: if unobstructed, they move along a straight line to
the beacon, and otherwise they slide on the edges of the polygon. The Euclidean
distance from a moving point to a beacon is monotonically decreasing. A given
beacon attracts a point if the point eventually reaches the beacon.
  The problem of attracting all points within a polygon with a set of beacons
can be viewed as a variation of the art gallery problem. Unlike most
variations, the beacon attraction has the intriguing property of being
asymmetric, leading to separate definitions of attraction region and inverse
attraction region. The attraction region of a beacon is the set of points that
it attracts. It is connected and can be computed in linear time for simple
polygons. By contrast, it is known that the inverse attraction region of a
point---the set of beacon positions that attract it---could have $\Omega(n)$
disjoint connected components.
  In this paper, we prove that, in spite of this, the total complexity of the
inverse attraction region of a point in a simple polygon is linear, and present
a $O(n \log n)$ time algorithm to construct it. This improves upon the best
previous algorithm which required $O(n^3)$ time and $O(n^2)$ space. Furthermore
we prove a matching $\Omega(n\log n)$ lower bound for this task in the
algebraic computation tree model of computation, even if the polygon is

to resent studies of complex Chern-Simons theories, while for $d>3$ they yield
corresponding higher dimensional generalizations. As a spinoff, we observe that
particular complex saddles of the partition functions correspond to the zeros
and the extrema of the Clausen functions $Cl_d(\theta)$ with odd and even index
$d$ respectively. These saddles lie on the unit circle at positions remarkably

us to place the following observational constraints (at the 99 per cent
confidence level) on the dimensionless convergence power spectrum
$\Delta^{2}_{\delta\kappa}$ and the standard deviation in the aperture mass
$\sigma_{\rm AM}$: $\Delta^{2}_{\delta\kappa}<1$ ($\sigma_{\rm AM}< 0.8 \times

estimated effect of CDM subhaloes. However, future analysis of a larger sample

site for studying the processes of particle acceleration in star forming
environments. The AGILE data are modelled through a template that quantifies
the gamma-ray diffuse emission expected from atomic and molecular hydrogen.
Other sources of emission are modelled as an isotropic contribution. Gamma-ray
emission exceeding the amount expected by the diffuse emission model is
detected with high level of significance. The main excess is in the
high-longitude part of Orion A. A thorough analysis of this feature suggests a
connection between the observed gamma-ray emission and the B0.5 Ia star k
Orionis. The location of the gamma-ray excess is compatible with the site where
stellar wind collides with the ISM. Both scattering on dark gas and cosmic-ray
acceleration at the shock between the two environments are discussed as
possible explanations, with the latter hypothesis being supported by the
hardness of the energy spectrum of the emission. If confirmed, this would be
the first direct detection of gamma-ray emission from the interaction between
ISM and a single star's stellar wind.

  This paper prepared in 21 pages, and it contains 9 figures",,,,"cs.CG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  For $\beta \geq 1$, the \emph{$\beta$-skeleton depth} ($\SkD_\beta$) of a
query point $q\in \mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to a distribution function $F$ on
$\mathbb{R}^d$ is defined as the probability that $q$ is contained within the
\emph{$\beta$-skeleton influence region} of a random pair of points from $F$.
The $\beta$-skeleton depth of $q\in \mathbb{R}^d$ can also be defined with
respect to a given data set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$. In this case, computing
the $\beta$-skeleton depth is based on counting all of the $\beta$-skeleton
influence regions, obtained from pairs of points in $S$, that contain $q$. The
$\beta$-skeleton depth introduces a family of depth functions that contains
\emph{spherical depth} and \emph{lens depth} for $\beta=1$ and $\beta=2$,
respectively. The straightforward algorithm for computing the $\beta$-skeleton
depth in dimension $d$ takes $O(dn^2)$. This complexity of computation is a
significant advantage of using the $\beta$-skeleton depth in multivariate data
analysis because unlike most other data depths, the time complexity of the
$\beta$-skeleton depth grows linearly rather than exponentially in the
dimension $d$. The main results of this paper include two algorithms. The first
one is an optimal algorithm that takes $\Theta(n\log n)$ for computing the
planar spherical depth, and the second algorithm with the time complexity of
$O(n^{\frac{3}{2}+\epsilon})$ is for computing the planar $\beta$-skeleton
depth, $\beta >1$. By reducing the problem of \textit{Element Uniqueness}, we
prove that computing the $\beta$-skeleton depth requires $\Omega(n \log n)$
time. Some geometric properties of $\beta$-skeleton depth are also investigated
in this paper. These properties indicate that \emph{simplicial depth} ($\SD$)
is linearly bounded by $\beta$-skeleton depth. Some experimental bounds for
different depth functions are also obtained in this paper.

passenger choices of flight itineraries. This problem has historically been
tackled using classical Discrete Choice Modelling techniques. Traditional
statistical approaches, in particular the Multinomial Logit model (MNL), is
widely used in industrial applications due to its simplicity and general good
performance. However, MNL models present several shortcomings and assumptions
that might not hold in real applications. To overcome these difficulties, we
present a new choice model based on Pointer Networks. Given an input sequence,
this type of deep neural architecture combines Recurrent Neural Networks with
the Attention Mechanism to learn the conditional probability of an output whose
values correspond to positions in an input sequence. Therefore, given a
sequence of different alternatives presented to a customer, the model can learn
to point to the one most likely to be chosen by the customer. The proposed
method was evaluated on a real dataset that combines on-line user search logs

goal in many fields of physics from condensed matter to cosmology. Using a
recently introduced manybody perturbation formalism for fermions, we propose a
mechanism for the emergence of collective behavior, specifically superfluidity,
driven by quantum statistics and the enforcement of the Pauli principle through
the selection of normal modes. The method, which is called symmetry invariant
perturbation theory (SPT), uses group theory and graphical techniques to solve
the manybody Schrodinger equation through first order exactly. The solution at
first order defines collective coordinates in terms of five N-body normal
modes, identified as breathing, center of mass, single particle angular
excitation, single particle radial excitation and phonon. A correspondence is
established ""on paper"" that enforces the Pauli principle through the assignment
of specific normal mode quantum numbers. Applied in the unitary regime, this
normal mode assignment yields occupation only in an extremely low frequency
N-body phonon mode at ultralow temperatures. A single particle radial
excitation mode at a much higher frequency creates a gap that stabilizes the
superfluidity at low temperatures. Coupled with the corresponding values for
the frequencies at unitarity obtained by this manybody calculation, we obtain
good agreement with experimental thermodynamic results including the lambda
transition in the specific heat. Our results suggest that the emergence of
collective behavior in macroscopic systems is driven by the Pauli principle and
its selection of the correct collective coordinates in the form of N-body
normal modes.

possible process is self-regulating star formation driven by feedback from

various signposts of feedback-driven star formation, the effectiveness of such
feedback has been questioned. Stellar and gas kinematics is a promising tool to
capture the relative motion of newborn stars and gas away from ionizing

formation of OB associations. These results support the self-regulating star

radiation field, the ISM conditions, the obscuring column, and the metallicity.
We find that an extreme starburst can mimic an AGN in two band mid-infrared
color cuts employed in the literature. However, the three band color cuts
employed in the literature require starbursts with extremely high ionization
parameters or gas densities . We show that the extreme mid-IR colors seen in

combination of high ionization parameters and high column densities. Based on
our theoretical calculations, we present a theoretical mid-infrared color cut
that will exclude even the most extreme starburst that we have modeled in this

The photon subtraction scheme offers enhancement with a relatively simple setup

integrated optics, particularly the ability to build stable multimode
interferometers with squeezed input states, a multimodal extension to the
enhancement via photon subtraction protocol is studied. States generated with
multiple squeezed input states, rather than a single input source, are shown to
be more sensitive to the enhancement protocol, leading to increased
entanglement at the output. Numerical results show the gain in entanglement is
not monotonic with the number of modes or the degree of squeezing in the
additional modes. Consequently, the advantage due to having multiple squeezed

scalability. Then, by choosing Lyapunov functions with appropriate sparsity
patterns, we decompose large positive semidefinite constraints in all of the
analysis problems into multiple smaller ones depending on the maximal cliques
of the system graph. This makes the solutions more computationally efficient
via a recent first-order algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
efficiency and scalability of the proposed method.

programming in a category of normed positive cones and stable measurable cone
maps, which can be seen as a coordinate-free generalization of probabilistic
coherence spaces. However, unlike the case of probabilistic coherence spaces,
it remained unclear if the model could be refined to a model of classical
linear logic.
  In this work we consider a somewhat similar category which gives indeed a
coordinate-free model of full propositional linear logic with nondegenerate
interpretation of additives and sound interpretation of exponentials. Objects
are dual pairs of normed cones satisfying certain specific completeness
properties, such as existence of norm-bounded monotone weak limits, and
morphisms are bounded (adjointable) positive maps. Norms allow us a distinct
interpretation of dual additive connectives as product and coproduct.
Exponential connectives are modelled using real analytic functions and
distributions that have representations as power series with positive
coefficients.
  Unlike the familiar case of probabilistic coherence spaces, there is no
reference or need for a preferred basis; in this sense the model is invariant.
Probabilistic coherence spaces form a full subcategory, whose objects, seen as
posets, are lattices. Thus we get a model fitting in the tradition of
interpreting linear logic in a linear algebraic setting, which arguably is free
from the drawbacks of its predecessors.
  Relations with constructions of Ehrhard, Pagani and Tasson's work are left

and classification of different types of materials in patient anatomy. This
work introduces a unified framework for accurate nonlinear material
decomposition and applies it, for the first time, in the concept of
triple-energy CT (TECT) for enhanced material differentiation and
classification as well as dual-energy CT. The triple-energy data acquisition is
implemented at the scales of micro-CT and clinical CT imaging with commercial
""TwinBeam"" dual-source DECT configuration and a fast kV switching DECT
configuration. Material decomposition and quantitative comparison with a photon
counting detector and with the presence of a bow-tie filter are also performed.
The proposed method provides quantitative material- and energy-selective images
examining realistic configurations for both dual- and triple-energy CT
measurements. Compared to the polychromatic kV CT images, virtual monochromatic
images show superior image quality. For the mouse phantom, quantitative
measurements show that the differences between gadodiamide and iodine
concentrations obtained using TECT and idealized photon counting CT (PCCT) are
smaller than 8 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL, respectively. TECT outperforms DECT for
multi-contrast CT imaging and is robust with respect to spectrum estimation.
For the thorax phantom, the differences between the concentrations of the
contrast map and the corresponding true reference values are smaller than 7
mg/mL for all of the realistic configurations. A unified framework for both
dual- and triple-energy CT imaging has been established for the accurate
extraction of material compositions; considering currently available commercial
DECT configurations. The novel technique is promising to provide an urgently
needed solution for several CT-based diagnosis and therapy applications.

system length, $D\sim L^{1.05}$. This short time behavior is consistent with
particle-based simulations. The long-time diffusion coefficient scales like
$D\sim L^{1.6}$, close to previous studies which found $D\sim L^{1.5}$.
Furthermore, we show that the near-field details of the interaction kernel do
not affect the short time behavior, but qualitatively and dramatically affect
the long time behavior, potentially causing a saturation of the mean-squared

practitioner by having no failure probability and always returning the same
results.
  We provide provable guarantees for deterministic column sampling using ridge
leverage scores. The matrix sketch returned by our algorithm is a column subset
of the original matrix, yielding additional interpretability. Like the
randomized counterparts, the deterministic algorithm provides (1 + {\epsilon})
error column subset selection, (1 + {\epsilon}) error projection-cost
preservation, and an additive-multiplicative spectral bound. We also show that
under the assumption of power-law decay of ridge leverage scores, this
deterministic algorithm is provably as accurate as randomized algorithms.
  Lastly, ridge regression is frequently used to regularize ill-posed linear
least-squares problems. While ridge regression provides shrinkage for the
regression coefficients, many of the coefficients remain small but non-zero.
Performing ridge regression with the matrix sketch returned by our algorithm
and a particular regularization parameter forces coefficients to zero and has a
provable (1 + {\epsilon}) bound on the statistical risk. As such, it is an
interesting alternative to elastic net regularization.

a general framework for addressing this question and defines a class of

two novel estimators are proposed that are applicable to arbitrary designs and

computing, applied under assumptions of large-scale public networks. They can
be used to store and share information without a trusted central party. There
has been much effort to develop blockchain systems for a myriad of uses,
ranging from cryptocurrencies to identity control, supply chain management,
etc. None of this work has directly studied the fundamental database issues
that arise when using blockchains as the underlying infrastructure to manage
data.
  The key difference between using blockchains to store data and centrally
controlled databases is that transactions are accepted to a blockchain via a
consensus mechanism. Hence, once a user has issued a transaction, she cannot be
certain if it will be accepted. Moreover, a yet unaccepted transaction cannot
be retracted by the user, and may be appended to the blockchain in the future.
This causes difficulties as the user may wish to reissue a transaction, if it
was not accepted. Yet this data may then become appended twice to the
blockchain.
  In this paper we present a database perspective on blockchains by introducing
formal foundations for blockchains as a storage layer that underlies a
database. The main issue that we tackle is uncertainty in transaction appending
that is a result of the consensus mechanism. We study two flavors of
transaction appending problems: (1) the complexity of determining whether it is
possible for a denial constraint to be contradicted, given the state of the
blockchain, pending transactions, and integrity constraints and (2) the
complexity of generating transactions that are mutually (in)consistent with
given subsets of pending transactions. Solving these problems is critical to
ensure that users can issue transactions consistent with their intentions.
Finally, we chart important directions for future work.

wireline system with a linear decoder, in increasingly large system sizes. This
analysis can be seen as a generalization of results obtained for wireless
communication. The features of the diagonal elements of the wireline channel
matrices make wireless asymptotic analyses inapplicable for wireline systems.
Further, direct application of results from random matrix theory (RMT) yields a
trivial lower bound. This paper presents a novel approach to asymptotic
analysis, where an alternative sequence of systems is constructed that includes
the system of interest in order to approximate the spectral efficiency of the
linear zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) crosstalk
cancelers. Using works in the field of large dimensional random matrices, we
show that the user rate in this sequence converges to a non-zero rate. The
approximation of the user rate for both the ZF and MMSE cancelers are very
simple to evaluate and does not need to take specific channel realizations into
account. The analysis reveals the intricate behavior of the throughput as a
function of the transmission power and the channel crosstalk. This unique
behavior has not been observed for linear decoders in other systems. The
approximation presented here is much more useful for the next generation G.fast
wireline system than earlier digital subscriber line (DSL) systems as
previously computed performance bounds, which are strictly larger than zero
only at low frequencies. We also provide a numerical performance analysis over
measured and simulated DSL channels which show that the approximation is
accurate even for relatively low dimensional systems and is useful for many
scenarios in practical DSL systems.

determination of a measure of the degrees of freedom of theories that is
consistent with the Renormalization Group flow. The answer seems to be encoded
in the C-theorems, that involve quantities which decrease with the
Renormalization Group flow to the IR and are stationary at the fixed points,
thus ordering the space of theories. In an originally different problem,
inspired by the use of spherical space forms in cosmological models, we study
the thermodynamic properties of a free theory at finite temperature defined on
such spaces. We start by analyzing the case of a conformal scalar theory: from
the zeta regularization of the effective action we compute the entropy, in
whose high-temperature expansion we find a term ---often disregarded--- which
does not depend on the temperature nor the radius of the covering sphere, which
can be obtained also as the determinant of the zero-temperature theory on the
spatial manifold, and which we relate to its topological properties. We
consider in the case of a massive theory the same expansion, whose
temperature-independent term depends on the mass, and we find that dependence
resemblant to the behavior of a C-quantity. We then analyze the behavior of the
same quantity for the free scalar and Dirac theories on real projective spaces
in arbitrary dimension.

  The main players are the cardinality filtration of n-cubes, the induced
interpolation between cocartesian and strongly cocartesian n-cubes, and the
yoga of iterated cone constructions. In the stable case, the representation
theories of chunks of n-cubes are related by compatible strong stable
equivalences and admit a global form of Serre duality. As sample applications,
we use these Serre equivalences to express colimits in terms of limits and to
relate the abstract representation theories of chunks by infinite chains of
adjunctions.
  On a more abstract side, along the way we establish a general decomposition
result for colimits, which specializes to the classical Bousfield-Kan formulas.
We also include a short discussion of abstract formulas and their compatibility
with morphisms, leading to the idea of universal formulas in monoidal homotopy

which are inconvenient for frequent monitoring. Furthermore, most recreational
runners do not have access to routine assessment of their physical fitness by
the aforementioned equipment so they are not able to calculate the lactate
threshold without resorting to an expensive and specialized centre. Therefore,
the main objective of this study is to create an intelligent system capable of

learning system which models the lactate evolution using recurrent neural

well as a modification of the stratified sampling method. The results show that
the proposed system accurately estimates the lactate threshold of 89.52% of the

is very high (R=0,89). Moreover, its behaviour with the test dataset is as good

the procedure is optimal in the sense that it achieves the optimal convergence
rate that is achievable by a biclustering oracle, adaptively over the whole
class, up to constants. This is further formalized by deriving a minimax lower
bound over a class of biclustering problems. The optimal rate we obtain
sharpens some of the existing results and generalizes others to a wide regime
of average degree growth, from sparse networks with average degrees growing
arbitrarily slowly to fairly dense networks with average degrees of order
$\sqrt{n}$. As a special case, we recover the known exact recovery threshold in
the $\log n$ regime of sparsity. To obtain the consistency result, as part of
the provable version of the algorithm, we introduce a sub-block partitioning

hot ambient medium pervading a massive galaxy does not drop much below 10 times
the freefall time t_ff at any radius. Theoretical models have accounted for
this finding by hypothesizing that cold clouds start to condense out of the
ambient medium when t_cool/t_ff < 10 and fuel a strong black-hole feedback
response that reheats the ambient gas, but those models have not yet been able
to provide a simple explanation for the origin of the critical t_cool/t_ff
ratio. This paper explores a heuristic model for condensation that links the
critical ratio to turbulent driving of gravity-wave oscillations. In the linear
regime, internal gravity waves are thermally unstable in a thermally balanced
medium. Buoyancy oscillations in a balanced medium with t_cool/t_ff therefore
grow until they saturate without condensing at an amplitude that depends on
t_cool/t_ff. However, in a medium with 10 < t_cool/t_ff < 20, turbulence with a
velocity dispersion roughly half the galaxy's stellar velocity dispersion can
drive those oscillations into condensation. Intriguingly, this is indeed the
gas-phase velocity dispersion observed among galaxy-cluster cores that contain
multiphase gas. It is therefore possible that both the critical t_cool/t_ff
ratio for condensation of ambient gas and the level of turbulence in that gas
are determined by coupling between condensation, feedback, and turbulence. Such
a system can converge to a well-regulated equilibrium state, as long as the
fraction of feedback energy that goes into turbulence is significantly less
than the fraction that goes more directly into heat.

transition kernel) is assumed and the control design is based on the given
model, raising the problem of performance loss due to the mismatch between the
assumed model and the actual model. Toward this end, we study continuity
properties of discrete-time stochastic control problems with respect to system
models (i.e., controlled transition kernels) and robustness of optimal control
policies designed for incorrect models applied to the true system. We study
both fully observed and partially observed setups under an infinite horizon
discounted expected cost criterion. We show that continuity and robustness
cannot be established under weak and setwise convergences of transition kernels
in general, but that the expected induced cost is robust under total variation.
By imposing further assumptions on the measurement models and on the kernel
itself (such as continuous convergence), we show that the optimal cost can be
made continuous under weak convergence of transition kernels as well. Using
these continuity properties, we establish convergence results and error bounds
due to mismatch that occurs by the application of a control policy which is
designed for an incorrectly estimated system model to a true model, thus
establishing positive and negative results on robustness.Compared to the
existing literature, we obtain strictly refined robustness results that are
applicable even when the incorrect models can be investigated under weak
convergence and setwise convergence criteria (with respect to a true model), in
addition to the total variation criteria. These entail positive implications on
empirical learning in (data-driven) stochastic control since often system
models are learned through empirical training data where typically weak
convergence criterion applies but stronger convergence criteria do not.

reformulating the equation into an equivalent system employing a scalar
auxiliary variable, we approximate the system at the time step $(n+\theta)$

devise a family of corresponding approximations that are second-order accurate

for the resultant discrete system of equations to overcome the difficulty
caused by the unknown scalar auxiliary variable. The final algorithm requires
only the solution of four de-coupled individual Helmholtz type equations within
each time step, which involve only constant and time-independent coefficient
matrices that can be pre-computed. A number of numerical examples are presented
to demonstrate the performance of the family of schemes developed herein. We
note that this family of second-order approximations can be readily applied to

detection technique leverages an existing solution for the video prediction
problem, and uses it on image sequences generated from monitoring the wireless
spectrum. The deep predictive coding network is trained with images
corresponding to the normal behavior of the system, and whenever there is an
anomaly, its detection is triggered by the deviation between the actual and
predicted behavior. For our analysis, we use the images generated from the
time-frequency spectrograms and spectral correlation functions of the received
RF signal. We test our technique on a dataset which contains anomalies such as
jamming, chirping of transmitters, spectrum hijacking, and node failure, and
evaluate its performance using standard classifier metrics: detection ratio,
and false alarm rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
methodology effectively detects many unforeseen anomalous events in real time.

the equation of state for the gas around, based on a catalog of numerical
simulations. The method uses machine learning methods based on convolutional
neural networks applied to the classification of images resulting from
numerical simulations. Specifically we focus on the supersonic velocity regime
and choose the direction of the black hole to be parallel to its spin. We build
a catalog of 900 simulations by numerically solving Euler's equations onto the
fixed space-time background of a black hole, for two parameters: the adiabatic
index $\Gamma$ with values in the range [1.1, 5/3], and the asymptotic relative
velocity of the black hole with respect to the surroundings $v_{\infty}$, with
values within $[0.2, 0.8]c$. For each simulation we produce a 2D image of the
gas density once the process of accretion has approached a stationary regime.
The results obtained show that the implemented Convolutional Neural Networks
are capable to classify correctly the adiabatic index $87.78\%$ of the time
within an uncertainty of $\pm 0.0284$ while the prediction of the velocity is
correct $96.67\%$ of the times within an uncertainty of $\pm 0.03c$. We expect
that this combination of a massive number of numerical simulations and machine
learning methods will help analyze more complicated scenarios related to future
high resolution observations of black holes, like those from the Event Horizon
Telescope.

Dynamic-Structured Semantic Propagation Network (DSSPN) that builds a semantic

recognizing a specific type of entity such as a super-class (e.g. food) or a
specific concept (e.g. pizza). During training, DSSPN performs the
dynamic-structured neuron computation graph by only activating a sub-graph of
neurons for each image in a principled way. A dense semantic-enhanced neural
block is proposed to propagate the learned knowledge of all ancestor neurons
into each fine-grained child neuron for feature evolving. Another merit of such
semantic explainable structure is the ability of learning a unified model
concurrently on diverse datasets by selectively activating different neuron
sub-graphs for each annotation at each step. Extensive experiments on four
public semantic segmentation datasets (i.e. ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, Cityscape and
Mapillary) demonstrate the superiority of our DSSPN over state-of-the-art

  Systems",,,,,"cs.AR cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While reduction in feature size makes computation cheaper in terms of
latency, area, and power consumption, performance of emerging data-intensive
applications is determined by data movement. These trends have introduced the
concept of scalability as reaching a desirable performance per unit cost by
using as few number of units as possible. Many proposals have moved compute
closer to the memory. However, these efforts ignored maintaining a balance
between bandwidth and compute rate of an architecture, with those of
applications, which is a key principle in designing scalable large systems.
This paper proposes the use of memory slices, a modular building block for
scalable memory systems integrated with compute, in which performance scales
with memory size (and volume of data). The slice architecture utilizes a
programmable memory interface feeding a systolic compute engine with high reuse
rate. The modularity feature of slice-based systems is exploited with a
partitioning and data mapping strategy across allocated memory slices where
training performance scales with the data size. These features enable shifting
the most pressure to cheap compute units rather than expensive memory accesses
or transfers via interconnection network. An application of the memory slices
to a scale-out memory system is accelerating the training of recurrent,
convolutional, and hybrid neural networks (RNNs and RNNs+CNN) that are forming
cloud workloads. The results of our cycle-level simulations show that memory
slices exhibits a superlinear speedup when the number of slices increases.
Furthermore, memory slices improve power efficiency to 747 GFLOPs/J for
training LSTMs. While our current evaluation uses memory slices with 3D
packaging, a major value is that slices can also be constructed with a variety
of packaging options, for example with DDR-based memory units.

yielding the first provably-correct algorithm for this problem. Given an
$\epsilon$-sample on the bounding surface, with a weak $\sigma$-sparsity
condition, we work with the balls of radius $\delta$ times the local feature
size centered at each sample. The corners of this union of balls are the
Voronoi sites, on both sides of the surface. The facets common to cells on

generating a bounded number of sites in its interior. Compared to

privileged spectrum of cnoidal EH are excited which in the present case consist
of a solitary electron hole (SEH), two counter-propagating ""Langmuir"" modes
(plasma oscillation), and an ion acoustic mode. A quantitative explanation
involves employing non-linear eigen-modes, yielding a non-linear dispersion
relation with a forbidden regime and the negative energy character of the SEH,
properties being inherent in Schamel's model of undamped Vlasov-Poisson
structures identified here as lowest order trapped particle equilibria. An
important role in the final adaption of nonlinear plasma eigenmodes is played
by a deterministic response of trapped electrons which facilitates transfer of
energy from electron thermal energy to an ion acoustic non-uniformity,
accelerating the SEH and positioning it into the right place assigned by the
theory.

fluctuation problem of mobile data traffic for cellular networks. The existing
schemes that focus on channel borrowing from neighboring cells cannot be
directly applied to future 5G wireless networks, because the neighboring cells
will reuse the same spectrum band in 5G systems. In this paper, we consider an
orthogonal frequency division multiple access~(OFDMA) ultra-dense small cell
network, where Device-to-Device~(D2D) communication is advocated to facilitate
load balancing without extra spectrum. Specifically, the data traffic can be
effectively offloaded from a congested small cell to other underutilized small
cells by D2D communications. The problem is naturally formulated as a joint
resource allocation and D2D routing problem that maximizes the system sum-rate.
To efficiently solve the problem, we decouple the problem into a resource
allocation subproblem and a D2D routing subproblem. The two subproblems are
solved iteratively as a monotonic optimization problem and a complementary
geometric programming problem, respectively. Simulation results show that the
data sum-rate in the neighboring small cells increases 20\% on average by
offloading the data traffic in the congested small cell to the neighboring
small cell base stations~(SBSs).

and evolution of the active region by constructing coronal magnetic field
models based on SDO/HMI magnetograms using two independent methods, i.e., the
nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation and the flux rope insertion
method. The models consist of multiple flux ropes with mixed signs of helicity,
i.e., positive (negative) in the northern (southern) region, which is
consistent with the GST observations of multiple filament bundles. The
footprints of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) derived from the extrapolated
NLFFF compare favorably with the observed flare ribbons. An interesting
double-ribbon fine structure located at the east border of the AFS is
consistent with the fine structure of the QSL's footprint. Moreover, magnetic
field lines traced along the semi-circular footprint of a dome-like QSL
surrounding the AFS are connected to the regions of significant helicity and
Poynting flux injection. The maps of magnetic twist show that positive twist
became dominant as time progressed, which is consistent with the injection of
positive helicity before the flares. We hence conclude that these circular
shaped flares are caused by 3D magnetic reconnection at the QSLs associated

increasing rates, fast analytics to extract meaningful results is becoming

alleviate this problem through a series of techniques. In-situ mechanisms
provide direct access to raw data in the original format---without loading and
partitioning. Parallel processing scales to the largest datasets. In-memory
caching reduces latency when the same data are accessed across a workload of
queries. However, we are not aware of any work on distributed caching of
multi-dimensional raw arrays. In this paper, we introduce a distributed
framework for cost-based caching of multi-dimensional arrays in native format.
Given a set of files that contain portions of an array and an online query
workload, the framework computes an effective caching plan in two stages.
First, the plan identifies the cells to be cached locally from each of the
input files by continuously refining an evolving R-tree index. In the second
stage, an optimal assignment of cells to nodes that collocates dependent cells
in order to minimize the overall data transfer is determined. We design cache
eviction and placement heuristic algorithms that consider the historical query
workload. A thorough experimental evaluation over two real datasets in three
file formats confirms the superiority -- by as much as two orders of magnitude
-- of the proposed framework over existing techniques in terms of cache
overhead and workload execution time.

Optical Reverberation Mapping collaboration. Approximately after half of the
light curves, the correlation between the broad emission lines and the
lag-corrected ultraviolet continua becomes weak. This anomalous behavior is
accompanied by an increase of soft X-ray emission. We propose a simple model to
understand this anomalous behavior, i.e., the corona might fall down, thereby
increasing the covering fraction of the inner disk. Therefore, X-ray and
extreme ultraviolet emission suffer from spectral variations. The ultraviolet
continua variations are driven by both X-ray and extreme ultraviolet
variations. Consequently, the spectral variability induced by the falling
corona would dilute the correlation between the broad emission lines and the
ultraviolet continua. Our model can explain many additional observational
facts, including the dependence of the anomalous behavior on velocity and
ionization energy. We also show that the time lag and correlation between the
X-ray and the ultraviolet variations change as NGC 5548 displays the anomalous
behavior. The time lag is dramatically longer than the expectation from disk
reprocessing if the anomalous behavior is properly excluded. During the
anomalous state, the time lag approaches the light-travel timescale of disk
reprocessing albeit with a much weaker correlation. We speculate that the time
lag in the normal state is caused by reprocessing of the broad line region gas.
As NGC 5548 enters the abnormal state, the contribution of the broad line
region gas is smaller; the time lag reflects disk reprocessing. We also discuss
alternative scenarios.

accretion. The first is magnetocentrifugal acceleration (MCA), the
overwhelmingly favored mechanism for the production of jets in most steady
accreting systems. The second is the zero-torque inner boundary condition. The
third is that effective viscous dissipation is like real dissipation, leading
directly to heating. All three assumptions fit nicely together in a manner that
is simple, persuasive, and mutually-consistent. All, I argue, are incorrect.
For concreteness I focus on protostars. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in
accretion is not a sink of energy, but a reservoir, capable of doing mechanical
work directly and therefore efficiently, rather than solely through ohmic
(""viscous"") heating. Advection of turbulence energy reduces the effective
radiative efficiency, and may help solve the missing boundary-layer emission
problem. The angular momentum problem, whereby accretion spins up a protostar
to breakup, is resolved by allowing direct viscous coupling to the protostar,
permitting substantially greater energy to be deposited into the accretion flow
than otherwise possible. This goes not into heat, but into a turbulent,
tangled, buoyant toroidal magnetic field. I argue that there is neither an
angular momentum problem nor an efficiency problem that MCA is needed to solve.
Moreover, the turbulent magnetic field has ample ability not just to collimate
but to accelerate gas, first radially inwards through tension forces and then
vertically through pressure forces, without any MCA mechanism. I suggest then
that jets, particularly the most powerful and well-collimated protostellar
jets, are not magnetocentrifugally driven.

new platform for a variety of liquid sodium experiments devoted to problems of
geo- and astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics. The most ambitious experiment
within this project is a precession driven dynamo experiment that currently is
under construction. It consists of a cylinder filled with liquid sodium that
simultaneously rotates around two axes. The experiment is motivated by the idea
of a precession-driven flow as a complementary energy source for the geodynamo
or the ancient lunar dynamo.
  In the present study we address numerical and experimental examinations in
order to identify parameter regions where the onset of magnetic field
excitation will be most probable. Both approaches show that in the strongly
nonlinear regime the flow is essentially composed of the directly forced
primary Kelvin mode and higher modes in terms of standing inertial waves that
arise from nonlinear self-interactions. A peculiarity is the resonance-like
emergence of an axisymmetric mode that represents a double roll structure in
the meridional plane, which, however, only occurs in a very limited range of
the precession ratio. This axisymmetric mode turns out to be beneficial for
dynamo action, and kinematic simulations of the magnetic field evolution
induced by the time-averaged flow exhibit magnetic field excitation at critical
magnetic Reynolds numbers around ${\rm{Rm}}^{\rm{c}}\approx 430$, which is well
within the range of the planned liquid sodium experiment.

spin-1/2. The nonzero temperature linear specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ and
the finite residual linear term of the thermal conductivity in the zero
temperature limit $\kappa_0/T=\kappa/T(T\rightarrow 0)$ are clearly resolved.
This demonstrates the presence of highly mobile gapless excitations, which is
consistent with fractionalized spinon excitations that form a Fermi surface.
Remarkably, an external magnetic field strongly suppresses $\gamma$, whereas it
enhances $\kappa_0/T$. This unusual contrasting behavior in the field
dependence of specific heat and thermal conductivity can be accounted for by
the presence of two types of gapless excitations with itinerant and localized
characters, as recently predicted theoretically (I. Kimchi et al.,

care-seekers and aims at optimizing the performance of the healthcare system by
supporting and guiding patients to the correct level of care and reduce the
amount of unscheduled visits. Good statistical models that describe the effects
of telephone nursing are important in order to study its impact on healthcare
resources and evaluate changes in telephone nursing procedures.
  Objective: To develop a valid model that captures the complex relationships
between the nurse's recommendations, the patients' intended actions and the
patients' health seeking behavior. Using the model to estimate the effects of
telephone nursing on patient behavior, healthcare utilization, and infer
potential cost savings.
  Methods: Bayesian ordinal regression modeling of data from randomly selected
patients that received telephone nursing. Inference is based on Markov Chain
Monte Carlo methods, model selection using the Watanabe-Akaike Information
Criteria, and model validation using posterior predictive checks on standard
discrepancy measures.
  Results and Conclusions: We present a robust Bayesian ordinal regression
model that predicts 76% of the patients' healthcare utilization after telephone
nursing and we found no evidence of model deficiencies. The model reveals a
risk reducing behavior and the effect of the telephone nursing recommendation
is 7 times higher than the effect of the patient's intended action prior to
consultation if the recommendation is the highest level of care. But the effect
of the nurse's recommendation is lower, or even non-existing, if the
recommendation is self-care. Telephone nursing was found to have a constricting
effect on healthcare utilization, however, the compliance to nurse's
recommendation is closely tied to perceptions of risk, emphasizing the
importance to address caller's needs of reassurance.

motions may play a key role in the transport of energy and momentum from the
lower atmosphere into the upper solar atmosphere, contributing to coronal
heating. The lower solar atmosphere also consists of complex networks of flux
tubes that expand and merge throughout the chromosphere and upper atmosphere.
We perform numerical simulations to investigate the behaviour of vortex driven
waves propagating in a pair of such flux tubes in a non-force-free equilibrium
with a realistically modelled solar atmosphere. The two flux tubes are
independently perturbed at their footpoints by counter-rotating vortex motions.
When the flux tubes merge, the vortex motions interact both linearly and
nonlinearly. The linear interactions generate many small-scale transient
magnetic substructures due to the magnetic stress imposed by the vortex
motions. Thus, an initially monolithic tube is separated into a complex
multi-threaded tube due to the photospheric vortex motions. The wave
interactions also drive a superposition that increases in amplitude until it
exceeds the local Mach number and produces shocks that propagate upwards with
speeds of approximately $ 50$ km s$^{-1}$. The shocks act as conduits
transporting momentum and energy upwards, and heating the local plasma by more
than an order of magnitude, with peak temperature approximately $60,000$ K.
Therefore, we present a new mechanism for the generation of magnetic waveguides
from the lower solar atmosphere to the solar corona. This wave guide appears as
the result of interacting perturbations in neighbouring flux tubes. Thus, the
interactions of photospheric vortex motions is a potentially significant
mechanism for energy transfer from the lower to upper solar atmosphere.

identifying the effective fields of scalar field, $f$, and of time-component

the usual BPS equations for dyon can be obtained naturally. We validate this
identification by showing that both Euler-Lagrange equations for $f$ and $j$
are identical in the BPS limit. The value of $\beta$ is bounded to $|\beta|<1$
due to reality condition on the resulting BPS equations. In the Born-Infeld

$4b^2$, with $b$ is the Born-Infeld parameter, will turn monopole(dyon) to
anti-monopole(anti-dyon) and vice versa. In all Generalized versions there are
additional constraint equations that relate the scalar-dependent couplings of
scalar and of gauge kinectic terms; or $G$ and $w$ respectively. For monopole
the constraint equation is $G=w^{-1}$, while for dyon is $w(G-\beta^2
w)=1-\beta^2$ which further gives lower bound to $G$ as such

storing some contents at the user's cache without knowledge of later demands.
Coded caching strategy was originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen to give
an additional coded caching gain compared the conventional uncoded scheme.
Under practical consideration, the caching model was recently considered in
relay network, in particular the combination network, where the central server
communicates with $K=\binom{H}{r}$ users (each is with a cache of $M$ files)
through $H$ immediate relays, and each user is connected to a different
$r-$subsets of relays. Several inner bounds and outer bounds were proposed for
combination networks with end-user-caches. This paper extends the recent work
by the authors on centralized combination networks with end-user caches to a
more general setting, where both relays and users have caches. In contrast to
the existing schemes in which the packets transmitted from the server are
independent of the cached contents of relays, we propose a novel caching scheme
by creating an additional coded caching gain to the transmitted load from the
server with the help of the cached contents in relays. We also show that the
proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

inner edge of the elongated relic at a distance of $\sim$ 600 kpc from the
cluster center. These radio sources were imaged at 323 and 608 MHz with the
Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope and at 1520 MHz with the Karl G Jansky Very
Large Array (VLA). The elongated relic was detected at all the frequencies with
a radio power at 1.4 GHz of 1.38$\pm 0.14 \times 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ having a
power law in the frequency range 70 - 1500 MHz (S$\propto \nu^{\alpha}, \alpha

from the known empirical relation between the radio powers of relics and the
host cluster masses. This is the lowest mass (M$_{500}$ = 1.24$\times$10$^{14}$

ring-shaped relic has a steeper spectral index ($\alpha$) of -1.74$\pm$0.29 in

noted that democratic institutions have witnessed no digital revolution through
the Internet. This observation leads this chapter to argue that the field of
e-democracy has generally failed to live up to its own reformist rhetoric. It
argues that instead of reforming government processes through technology,
e-democracy projects have tended to focus either on lowering the costs and
increasing the efficiency of existing political processes or on analysing the
civic participation that occurs outside of purpose-built e-democracy platforms.
The chapter suggests that this lack of attention to the Internet's potential
for systemic change in formal political institutions has little normative
impact on the democratization of society and may even re-enforce, rather than
challenge, the sociopolitical status quo. Further, it suggests that the current
approach of e-democracy risks normalizing the Internet to the norms and
expectations of the offline world. To elucidate this argument, this chapter
overviews both the general trend of e-democracy projects and criticisms of
those projects. Finally, the chapter proposes a more radical vision of
e-democracy that, it suggests, would usher a larger potential for
democratization. This more radical vision of e-democracy consists of
recognizing the attributes of the Internet that transcend the limits of the
analogue world and applying these to democracy. Such an approach would open the
path for envisaging new political processes and systems, allowing the field of

processes for geographical analyses. However, the internal relations between
the two types of models have not been brought to light. This paper is devoted
to integrating spatial autocorrelation analysis and spatial interaction
analysis into a logic framework by means of Getis-Ord's indexes. Based on
mathematical derivation and transform, the spatial autocorrelation measurements
of Getis-Ord's indexes are reconstructed in a new and simple form. A finding is
that the local Getis-Ord's indexes of spatial autocorrelation are equivalent to
the rescaled potential energy indexes of spatial interaction theory based on
power-law distance decay. The normalized scatterplot is introduced into the
spatial analysis based on Getis-Ord's indexes, and the potential energy indexes
are proposed as a complementary measurement. The global Getis-Ord's index
proved to be the weighted sum of the potential energy indexes and the direct
sum of total potential energy. The empirical analysis of the system of Chinese
cities are taken as an example to illustrate the effect of the improved methods
and measurements. The mathematical framework newly derived from Getis-Ord's
work is helpful for further developing the methodology of geographical spatial
modeling and quantitative analysis.

retrieval. No instrument detects all clouds, and analyses that use a given

to clarify which subsets of clouds are detected in a robust way by passive
sensors, and which require active sensors. To do so, we identify where
retrievals of Cloud Amounts (CAs), based on numerous sensors and algorithms,
differ the most. We investigate large uncertainties, and confront retrievals
from the CALIOP lidar, which detects semitransparent clouds and directly
measures their vertical distribution, whatever the surface below. We document
the cloud vertical distribution, opacity and seasonal variability where CAs
from passive sensors disagree most. CALIOP CAs are larger than the passive
average by +0.05 (AM) and +0.07 (PM). Over land, the +0.1 average difference
rises to +0.2 over the African desert, Antarctica and Greenland, where large
passive disagreements are traced to unfavorable surface conditions. Over
oceans, CALIOP retrievals are closer to the average of passive retrievals
except over the ITCZ (+0.1). Passive CAs disagree more in tropical areas
associated with large-scale subsidence, where CALIOP observes a specific
multi-layer cloud population: optically thin, high-level clouds and opaque
(z>7km), shallow boundary layer clouds (z<2km). We evaluate the CA and cloud
vertical distribution from 8 General Circulation Models where passive
retrievals disagree and CALIOP provides new information. We find that modeled
clouds are not more realistic where cloud detections from passive observations
have long been robust, than where active sensors provide more reliable
information.

It
was originally proposed by Google for ranking pages in the World-Wide Web. One
of the intriguing empirical properties of PageRank is the so-called `power-law
hypothesis': in a scale-free network the PageRank scores follow a power law
with the same exponent as the (in-)degrees. Up to date, this hypothesis has
been confirmed empirically and in several specific random graphs models. In
contrast, this paper does not focus on one random graph model but investigates
the existence of an asymptotic PageRank distribution, when the graph size goes
to infinity, using local weak convergence. This may help to identify general
network structures in which the power-law hypothesis holds. We start from the
definition of local weak convergence for sequences of (random) undirected
graphs, and extend this notion to directed graphs. To this end, we define an
exploration process in the directed setting that keeps track of in- and
out-degrees of vertices. Then we use this to prove the existence of an
asymptotic PageRank distribution. As a result, the limiting distribution of
PageRank can be computed directly as a function of the limiting object. We
apply our results to the directed configuration model and continuous-time
branching processes trees, as well as preferential attachment models.

the plasmoids formed during magnetic reconnection in the impulsive phase of
solar flares. In the present paper we analyze oscillations and waves in seven
examples of drifting pulsation structures, observed by the 800-2000 MHz
Ondrejov radiospectrograph. For their analysis we use a new type of oscillation
maps which give us a much more information about processes in DPSs than that in
previous analyzes. Based on these oscillation maps, made from radio spectra by
the wavelet technique, we recognized quasi-periodic oscillations with periods
ranging from about 1 to 108 s in all studied DPSs. This strongly supports the
idea that DPSs are generated during a fragmented magnetic reconnection. Phases
of most the oscillations in DPSs, especially for the period around 1 s, are
synchronized (""infinite"" frequency drift) in the whole frequency range of DPSs.
For longer periods in some DPSs we found that the phases of the oscillations
drift with the frequency drift in the interval from -17 to +287 MHz\s. We
propose that these drifting phases can be caused (a) by the fast or slow
magnetosonic waves generated during the magnetic reconnection and propagating
through the plasmoid, (b) by a quasi-periodic structure in the plasma inflowing
to the reconnection forming a plasmoid, and (c) by a quasi-periodically varying
reconnection rate in the X-point of the reconnection close to the plasmoid.

which drift inward towards the star, when they reach sizes of mm-cm. When they
cross the orbit of a planet, a fraction of these drifting pebbles will be
accreted. In the pebble accretion mechanism, the combined effects of the
planet's gravitational attraction and gas drag greatly increase the accretion
rate. We calculate the pebble accretion efficiency $\varepsilon_{2D}$ -- the
probability a pebble is accreted by the planet -- in the 2D limit (pebbles
reside in the midplane). In particular, we investigate the dependence of
$\varepsilon_{2D}$ on the planet eccentricity and its implications for planet
formation models. We conduct N-body simulations to calculate the pebble
accretion efficiency in both the local frame and the global frame. With the
global method we investigate the pebble accretion efficiency when the planet is
on an eccentric orbit. We find that the local and the global methods generally
give consistent results. The efficiency increases with the planet's
eccentricity once the relative velocity between the pebble and the planet is
determined by the planet's eccentric velocity. At large eccentricities,
however, the relative velocity becomes too large for pebble accretion. The
efficiency then drops significantly and the accretion enters the ballistic
regime. We present general expressions for $\varepsilon_{2D}$. Applying the
obtained formula to the formation of a secondary planet, in resonance with an
already-formed giant planet, we find that the embryo grows quickly due to its
larger eccentricity. The maximum $\varepsilon_{2D}$ for a planet on an
eccentric orbit is several times higher than for a planet on a circular orbit,
but this increase gives the planet an important headstart and boosts its
following mass growth.

also affects the ability of pebbles to be accreted by protoplanets, because it
stirs pebbles out of the disk midplane. In addition, turbulence can suppress
pebble accretion once the relative velocities become too large for the settling
mechanism to be viable. Following Paper I, we aim to quantify these effects by
calculating the pebble accretion efficiency $\varepsilon$ using three-body
simulations. To model the effect of turbulence on the pebbles, we derive a
stochastic equation of motion (SEOM) applicable to stratified disk
configurations. In the strong coupling limit (ignoring particle inertia) the
limiting form of this equation agrees with previous works. We conduct a
parameter study and calculate $\varepsilon$ in 3D, varying pebble and gas
(turbulence) properties and accounting for the planet inclination. We find that
strong turbulence suppresses pebble accretion through turbulent diffusion,
agreeing within factors of order unity with previous works. Another reduction
of $\varepsilon$ occurs when the turbulent rms motions are large and the
settling mechanism fails. Efficiency-wise, the outer disk regions are more
affected by turbulence than the inner regions. At the location of the H$_2$O
iceline, planets around low-mass stars achieve much higher efficiencies.
Including the results from Paper I, we present a framework to obtain
$\varepsilon$ under general circumstances.

on splines of higher order which leads to higher order Mumford-Shah models. In
this work, we study these models in the univariate situation: we discuss
important differences to the first order Mumford-Shah model, and we obtain
uniqueness results for their solutions. As a main contribution, we derive fast

that the worst case complexity of all proposed schemes is quadratic in the

convex sublattice containing the concrete parametrisation space specified by
its infimum and supremum parametrisations. It is shown that the computed
abstractions are optimal, i.e., no smaller convex sublattice exists. Although
the abstraction may introduce over-approximation, it has been proven to be
conservative with respect to reachability of states.
  Then, an unfolding semantics for Parametric Regulatory Networks is defined,
taking advantage of concurrency between transitions to provide a compact
representation of reachable transitions. A prototype implementation is
provided: it has been applied to several examples of Boolean and multi-valued
networks, showing its tractability for networks with numerous components.

up and down quarks and massive strange quarks in the baryon number sectors $B =

breaking gives rise to rotor spectra, as the chiral order parameter precesses
through the vacuum manifold. Baryons of different isospin influence the motion
of the order parameter through non-trivial Berry phases and associated abstract
monopole fields. Our investigation provides detailed insights into the dynamics
of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD on a torus. It also sheds new
light on Berry phases in the context of quantum field theory. Interestingly,
the Berry gauge field resulting from QCD solves a Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons
equation of motion on the vacuum manifold $SU(2) = S^3$.

most one accepting run on every input, the language of such an automaton is
called an unambiguous language. It is known that not every regular language of
infinite trees is unambiguous. Except that, very little is known about which
regular tree languages are unambiguous.
  This paper answers the question whether unambiguous languages are of bounded
complexity among all regular tree languages. The notion of complexity is the
canonical one, called the (parity or Rabin-Mostowski) index hierarchy. The
answer is negative, as exhibited by a family of examples of unambiguous
languages that cannot be recognised by any alternating parity tree automata of
bounded range of priorities.
  Hardness of the given examples is based on the theory of signatures in parity
games, previously studied by Walukiewicz. This theory is further developed here
to construct canonical signatures. The technical core of the article is a
parity game that compares signatures of a given pair of parity games (without

with a radius of ~0.171 arcsec (~291 au at 1.7 kpc distance). The continuum

clearly indicate that the disk is optically thick for a radius of R<170 au. The
linear polarization of the dust emission is detected almost all along the disk
and its properties suggest that dust polarization is produced mainly by
self-scattering. However, the polarization pattern presents a clear
differentiation between the inner (optically thick) part of the disk and the
outer (optically thin) region of the disk, with a sharp transition that occurs
at a radius of 0.1 arcsec (~170 au). The polarization characteristics of the
inner disk suggest that dust settling has not occurred yet with a maximum dust
grain size between 50 and 500 mum. The outer part of the disk has a clear
azimuthal pattern but with a significantly higher polarization fraction
compared to the inner disk. This pattern is broadly consistent with
self-scattering of a radiation field that is beamed radially outward, as

(Forbush decrease) in December 2006 measured by the PAMELA instrument are
presented. Forbush decreases are sudden suppressions of the GCR intensities
which are associated with the passage of interplanetary transients such as
shocks and interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Most of the past
measurements of this phenomenon were carried out with ground-based detectors
such as neutron monitors or muon telescopes. These techniques allow only the
indirect detection of the overall GCR intensity over an integrated energy
range. For the first time, thanks to the unique features of the PAMELA magnetic
spectrometer, the Forbush decrease commencing on 2006 December 14, following a
CME at the Sun on 2006 December 13 was studied in a wide rigidity range (0.4 -
20 GV) and for different species of GCRs detected directly in space. The daily
averaged GCR proton intensity was used to investigate the rigidity dependence
of the amplitude and the recovery time of the Forbush decrease. Additionally,
for the first time, the temporal variations in the helium and electron
intensities during a Forbush decrease were studied. Interestingly, the temporal
evolutions of the helium and proton intensities during the Forbush decrease
were found in good agreement, while the low rigidity electrons (< 2 GV)
displayed a faster recovery. This difference in the electron recovery is
interpreted as a charge-sign dependence introduced by drift motions experienced
by the GCRs during their propagation through the heliosphere.

paper presents a systematic study of the impact of the classical electrical

two-qubit gates and read-out, are considered, in the presence of errors in the

intermediate level of input heterogeneity, but heterogeneous output
connectivity cannot evoke avalanche dynamics. In the criticality region, the
co-emergence of multi-scale cortical activities is observed, and both the
avalanche dynamics and neuronal oscillations are modulated by the input
heterogeneity. Remarkably, we show similar results can be reproduced in
networks with various types of in- and out-degree distributions. Overall, these
findings not only provide details on the underlying circuitry mechanisms of
nonrandom synaptic connectivity in the regulation of neuronal avalanches, but
also inspire testable hypotheses for future experimental studies.

that the dust distribution is frequently elongated along the polar direction of
an AGN. To explain these findings, we developed a model scenario for the inner
~30 pc of an AGN. We assume a rotating thick gas disk between about one and ten
parsec. External gas accretion adds mass and injects energy via gas compression
into this gas disk and drives turbulence. Our disks are assumed to be strongly
magnetized via equipartition between the turbulent gas pressure and the energy
density of the magnetic field. In a second step, we built three dimensional
density cubes based on the analytical model, illuminated them with a central
source, and made radiative transfer calculations. In a third step, we
calculated MIR visibility amplitudes and compared them to available
interferometric observations. We show that magnetocentrifugal winds starting
from a thin and thick gas disk are viable in active galaxy centers. Once the
wind is launched, it is responsible for the transport of angular momentum and
the gas disk can become thin. The outflow scenario can account for the
elongated dust structures, outer edges of the thin maser disks, and molecular
outflows observed in local AGN. The models reproduce the observed terminal wind
velocities, the scatter of the MIR/intrinsic X-ray correlation, and point
source fractions. An application of the model to the Circinus Galaxy and NGC
1068 shows that the IR SED, available MIR interferometric observations, and
optical polarization can be reproduced in a satisfactory way, provided that (i)
a puff-up at the inner edge of the thin disk is present and (ii) a local screen
with an optical depth of tau_V 20 in form of a local gas filament and/or a warp

Spectroscopy has recently allowed to study a significant sample of stripped

Phenomena in galaxies with MUSE (GASP) survey. However, optical spectroscopy
can only trace the ionized gas component through the H$_{\alpha}$ emission that
can be spatially resolved on kpc scale at this redshift. The complex interplay
between the various gas phases (ionized, neutral, molecular) is however yet to
be understood. We report here the detection of large amounts of molecular gas
both in the tails and in the disks of 4 jellyfish galaxies from the GASP sample
with stellar masses $\sim 3.5\times 10^{10}-3\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$, showing
strong stripping. The mass of molecular gas that we measure in the tails
amounts to several $10^9 M_{\odot}$ and the total mass of molecular gas ranges
between 15 and 100 \% of the galaxy stellar mass. The molecular gas content
within the galaxies is compatible with the one of normal spiral galaxies,
suggesting that the molecular gas in the tails has been formed in-situ. We find
a clear correlation between the ionized gas emission $\rm H\alpha$ and the
amount of molecular gas. The CO velocities measured from APEX data are not
always coincident with the underlying $\rm H\alpha$ emitting knots, and the
derived Star Formation Efficiencies appear to be very low.

developing robust perception models. In this paper, we present the ApolloScape

contains much large and richer labelling including holistic semantic dense
point cloud for each site, stereo, per-pixel semantic labelling, lanemark

every frame in various driving videos from multiple sites, cities and daytimes.
For each task, it contains at lease 15x larger amount of images than SOTA

algorithms specified for each task to accelerate the labelling process, such as
3D-2D segment labeling tools, active labelling in videos etc. Depend on
ApolloScape, we are able to develop algorithms jointly consider the learning
and inference of multiple tasks. In this paper, we provide a sensor fusion
scheme integrating camera videos, consumer-grade motion sensors (GPS/IMU), and
a 3D semantic map in order to achieve robust self-localization and semantic
segmentation for autonomous driving. We show that practically, sensor fusion
and joint learning of multiple tasks are beneficial to achieve a more robust

support and motivate researchers for further development of multi-sensor fusion

Several goals
guided the design of the architecture. First was the need to extend the vector
processing capability associated with the ARM AArch64 execution state to better
address the computational requirements in domains such as high-performance
computing, data analytics, computer vision, and machine learning. Second was
the desire to introduce an extension that can scale across multiple
implementations, both now and into the future, allowing CPU designers to choose
the vector length most suitable for their power, performance, and area targets.
Finally, the architecture should avoid imposing a software development cost as
the vector length changes and where possible reduce it by improving the reach
of compiler auto-vectorization technologies. SVE achieves these goals. It
allows implementations to choose a vector register length between 128 and 2,048
bits. It supports a vector-length agnostic programming model that lets code run
and scale automatically across all vector lengths without recompilation.
Finally, it introduces several innovative features that begin to overcome some
of the traditional barriers to autovectorization.

  simulation study","24 pages, 7 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Structural Equation Models (SEMs) are routinely used in the analysis of
empirical data by researchers from different scientific fields such as
psychologists or economists. In some fields, such as in ecology, SEMs have only
started recently to attract attention and thanks to dedicated software packages
the use of SEMs has steadily increased. Yet, common analysis practices in such
fields that might be transposed from other statistical techniques such as model
acceptance or rejection based on p-value screening might be poorly fitted for
SEMs especially when these models are used to confirm or reject hypotheses.
  In this simulation study, SEMs were fitted via two commonly used R packages:
lavaan and piecewiseSEM. Five different data-generation scenarios were
explored: (i) random, (ii) exact, (iii) shuffled, (iv) underspecified and (v)
overspecified. In addition, sample size and model complexity were also varied
to explore their impact on various global and local model fitness indices.
  The results showed that not one single model index should be used to decide
on model fitness but rather a combination of different model fitness indices is
needed. The global chi-square test for lavaan or the Fisher's C statistic for
piecewiseSEM were, in isolation, poor indicators of model fitness. In addition,
the simulations showed that to achieve sufficient power to detect individual
effects, adequate sample sizes are required. Finally, BIC showed good capacity
to select models closer to the truth especially for more complex models.
  I provide, based on these results, a flowchart indicating how information
from different metrics may be combined to reveal model strength and weaknesses.
Researchers in scientific fields with little experience in SEMs, such as in
ecology, should consider and accept these limitations.

further enhance the discriminative power of the features. The proposed
triplet-center loss learns a center for each class and requires that the
distances between samples and centers from the same class are closer than those
from different classes. Extensive experimental results on two popular 3D object

its ability to reproduce the observations. Its first observational evidence
appeared from the type Ia supernovae (SNIa) Hubble diagram. However, there has
been some debate in the literature concerning the statistical treatment of
SNIa. In this paper we relax the standard assumption that SNIa intrinsic
luminosity is independent of the redshift, and we examine whether it may have
an impact on the accelerated nature of the expansion of the Universe. In order
to be as general as possible, we reconstruct the expansion rate of the Universe
through a cubic spline interpolation fitting observations of different probes:
SNIa, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the high-redshift information
from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We show that when SNIa intrinsic
luminosity is not allowed to vary as a function of the redshift, cosmic
acceleration is definitely proven in a model-independent approach. However,
allowing for a redshift dependence, a non-accelerated reconstruction of the
expansion rate is able to fit, as well as $\Lambda$CDM, the combination of SNIa
and BAO data, both treating the BAO standard ruler $r_d$ as a free parameter,
or adding the recently published prior from CMB observations. We further extend
the analysis by including the CMB data, and we show that a non-accelerated
reconstruction is able to nicely fit this combination of low and high-redshift
data. In this work we present a model-independent reconstruction of a
non-accelerated expansion rate of the Universe that is able to nicely fit all
the main background cosmological probes. However, the predicted value of $H_0$
is in tension with recent direct measurements. Our analysis points out that a
final, reliable, and consensual value for $H_0$ would be critical to
definitively prove the cosmic acceleration in a model-independent way.

correlation: quantile correlation coefficient of random variables X, Y. The
quantile correlation is defined by the geometric mean of two quantile
regression slopes of X on Y and Y on X in the same way that the Pearson
correlation is related with the regression coefficients of Y on X and X on Y.
The degree of tail dependent association in X, Y, if any, is well reflected in
the quantile correlation. The quantile correlation makes it possible to measure
sensitivity of a conditional quantile of a random variable with respect to
change of the other variable. The properties of the quantile correlation are
similar to those of the correlation. This enables us to interpret it from the
perspective of correlation, on which tail dependence is reflected. We construct
measures for tail dependent correlation and tail asymmetry and develop
statistical tests for them. We prove asymptotic normality of the estimated
quantile correlation and limiting null distributions of the proposed tests,
which is well supported in finite samples by a Monte-Carlo study. The proposed
quantile correlation methods are well illustrated by analyzing birth weight

pronounced than the $q=0$ ordering for all values of $S$. In the extreme
quantum case $S=1/2$ the zero-temperature correlation length is only of the
order of the nearest-neighbor separation. Then we study the temperature
dependence of several physical quantities for spin quantum numbers
$S=1/2,1,\dots,7/2$. As increasing $S$ the typical maximum in the specific heat
and in the uniform susceptibility are shifted towards lower values of
$T/S(S+1)$ and the height of the maximum is growing. The structure factor
${\cal S}(\mathbf{q})$ exhibits two maxima at magnetic wave vectors

analytical formula is derived for the energy spectrum of the prolate
{\gamma}-rigid Bohr-Mottelson Hamiltonian of nuclei, within a quantum
perturbation method (QPM), by considering a scaled Davidson potential in
\b{eta} shape variable. In the resulting solution, called X(3)-D-ML, the ground
state and the first \b{eta}-band are all studied as a function of the free
parameters. The fact of introducing the minimal length concept with a QPM makes
the model very flexible and a powerful approach to describe nuclear collective
excitations of a variety of vibrational-like nuclei. The introduction of
scaling parameters in the Davidson potential enables us to get a physical
minimum of this latter in comparison with previous works. The analysis of the
corrected wave function, as well as the probability density distribution, shows
that the minimal length parameter has a physical upper bound limit.

the object-oriented class level. This is due to the granularity level where
components expose their functionalities at an abstract level compared to the
fine-grained object-oriented classes. Moreover, components clearly define their
dependencies through their provided and required interfaces in an explicit way
that facilitates the understanding of how to reuse these components. Therefore,
several component identification approaches have been proposed to identify
components based on the analysis object-oriented software applications.
Nevertheless, most of the existing component identification approaches did not
consider co-usage dependencies between API classes to identify classes/methods
that can be reused to implement a specific scenario. In this paper, we propose
an approach to identify reusable software components in object-oriented APIs,
based on the interactions between client applications and the targeted API. As
we are dealing with actual clients using the API, dynamic analysis allows to
better capture the instances of API usage. Approaches using static analysis are
usually limited by the difficulty of handling dynamic features such as
polymorphism and class loading. We evaluate our approach by applying it to
three Java APIs with eight client applications from the DaCapo benchmark.
DaCapo provides a set of pre-defined usage scenarios. The results show that our
component identification approach has a very high precision.

absorbing layers in an FFT-accelerated volume integral equation (VIE) method

place absorbing regions in which the conductivity is increased gradually in
order to minimize reflections. In the continuous setting, such adiabatic
absorbers have been shown via coupled-mode theory to produce reflections that
diminish at a rate related to the smoothness of the absorption profile
function. The VIE formulation we employ relies on uniform discretizations of
the geometry over which the continuously varying fields and material properties
are represented by piecewise constant functions. Such a discretization enables
the acceleration of the method via the FFT and, furthermore, the introduction
of varying absorption can be performed in a straightforward manner without
compromising this speedup. We demonstrate that, in spite of the crude discrete
approximation to the smooth absorption profiles, our approach recovers the
theoretically predicted reflection behavior of adiabatic absorbers. We thereby
show that the FFT-accelerated VIE method is an effective and fast simulation
tool for nanophotonics simulations.

ways of encoding the information, doing or not transfer learning and processing

Depending on an object's orientation and on a sensor's flight path, objects of
the same semantic class can be observed in different orientations in the same
image. Equivariance to rotation, in this context understood as responding with
a rotated semantic label map when subject to a rotation of the input image, is
therefore a very desirable feature, in particular for high capacity models,
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). If rotation equivariance is
encoded in the network, the model is confronted with a simpler task and does
not need to learn specific (and redundant) weights to address rotated versions
of the same object class. In this work we propose a CNN architecture called
Rotation Equivariant Vector Field Network (RotEqNet) to encode rotation
equivariance in the network itself. By using rotating convolutions as building
blocks and passing only the the values corresponding to the maximally
activating orientation throughout the network in the form of orientation
encoding vector fields, RotEqNet treats rotated versions of the same object
with the same filter bank and therefore achieves state-of-the-art performances
even when using very small architectures trained from scratch. We test RotEqNet
in two challenging sub-decimeter resolution semantic labeling problems, and
show that we can perform better than a standard CNN while requiring one order
of magnitude less parameters.

dominated by a starlight emission from host galaxies redward of the Balmer

on June 1st, 2017 and SDSS DR14 spectrum taken on May 29, 2017 indicate that
the object is of a typical quasar spectrum with a blue continuum and strong
Balmer broad emission lines. In addition, an intermediate spectral type can be
identified in the SDSS DR13 spectrum taken in 2015. The invariability of the
line wing of MgII$\lambda2800$ emission and time scale argument (The
invariability of [OIII]$\lambda$5007 line blue asymmetry) suggests that a
variation of obscuration (an accelerating outflow) is not a favorable scenario.
The time scale argument allows us to believe the type transition is possibly

training overhead and the limited coherence time. Current wireless systems
assume the same coherence slot duration for all users, regardless of their
heterogeneous Doppler spreads. In this paper, we exploit this neglected degree
of freedom in addressing the training overhead bottleneck. We propose a new
uplink training scheme where the periodicity of pilot transmission differs
among users based on their actual channel coherence times. Since the changes in
the wireless channel are, primarily, due to movement, uplink training decisions
are optimized, over long time periods, while considering the evolution of the
users channels and locations. Owing to the different rates of the wireless
channel and location evolution, a two time scale control problem is formulated.
In the fast time scale, an optimal training policy is derived by choosing which
users are requested to send their pilots. In the slow time scale, location
estimation decisions are optimized. Simulation results show that the derived
training policies provide a considerable improvement of the cumulative average
spectral efficiency even with partial location knowledge.

dielectric systems have been investigated in the past. However, it is still not
understood how on-chip nanoplasmonic antennas, interacting with a single
quantum emitter, affect the quantum statistics of photons reflected or
transmitted in the guided mode of a waveguide. Here we investigate a quantum
photonic platform consisting of an evanescently coupled nanoplasmonic

the nanoplasmonic cavity to predict the quantum statistics of the transmitted

analytical predictions match numerical simulations based on a master equation
approach. It is moreover shown that for resonant excitation the degree of
anti-bunching in transmission is maximized for an optimal cavity modal volume
$V_{c}$ and cavity-emitter distance $s$. In reflection, perfectly anti-bunched
light can only be obtained for specific $(V_{c},s)$ combinations. Finally, our
model also applies to dielectric cavities and as such can guide future efforts

black holes (BHs). We test these models by fitting the observational
distributions in both redshift and isotropic energy of 22 Parkes FRBs, where,
as usual, the rates of compact binary mergers (CBMs) are connected with cosmic
star formation rates by a power-law distributed time delay. It is found that
the observational distributions can well be produced by the CBM model with a
characteristic delay time from several ten to several hundred Myr and an energy
function index $1.2\lesssim\gamma\lesssim1.7$, where a tentative fixed spectral
index $\beta=0.8$ is adopted for all FRBs. Correspondingly, the local event
rate of FRBs is constrained to $(3-6)\times10^4f_{\rm b}^{-1}(\mathcal T/270\rm
s)^{-1}(\mathcal A/2\pi)^{-1}\rm ~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for an adopted minimum FRB
energy of $E_{\min}=3\times10^{39}$ erg, where $f_{\rm b}$ is the beaming
factor of the radiation, $\mathcal T$ is the duration of each pointing
observation, and $\mathcal A $ is the sky area of the survey. This event rate,
about an order of magnitude higher than the rates of NS-NS/NS-BH mergers,
indicates that the most promising origin of FRBs in the CBM scenario could be
mergers of WD-WD binaries. Here a massive WD could be produced since no FRB was
found to be associated with a type Ia supernova. Alternatively, if actually all
FRBs can repeat on a timescale much longer than the period of current
observations, then they could also originate from a young active NS that forms
from relatively rare NS-NS mergers and accretion-induced collapses of WD-WD

is governed by point defect processes, which, despite many years of research,
remain poorly understood. The key difficulty in the description of the dominant
charged defects is determining a consistent position of the corresponding
defect levels, which is difficult to derive using standard supercell
calculations. In a complementary approach, we take advantage of the embedded
cluster methodology that provides direct access to a common zero of the
electrostatic potential for all point defects in all charge states. Charged
defects polarise a host dielectric material with long-range forces that
strongly affect the outcome of defect simulations; to account for the
polarisation we couple embedding with the hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular
mechanical (QM/MM) approach and investigate the structure, formation and
ionisation energies, and equilibrium concentrations of native point defects in
wurtzite GaN at a chemically accurate hybrid-density-functional-theory level. N
vacancies are the most thermodynamically favourable native defects in GaN,
which contribute to the n-type character of as-grown GaN but are not the main
source, a result that is consistent with experiment. Our calculations show no
native point defects can form thermodynamically stable acceptor states. GaN can
be easily doped n-type, but, in equilibrium conditions at moderate temperatures
acceptor dopants will be compensated by N vacancies and no significant hole
concentrations will be observed, indicating non-equilibrium processes must
dominate in p-type GaN. We identify spectroscopic signatures of native defects
in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet luminescence ranges and complementary
spectroscopies. Crucially, we calculate the effective-mass-like-state levels
associated with electrons and holes bound in diffuse orbitals...

balanced steady-state free precession (fmSSFP) MRI is presented. In this work,
suitable data acquisition schemes, subspace sizes, and efficiencies for banding
removal are investigated.
  Theory and Methods: By combining a fmSSFP MRI sequence with a 3D
stack-of-stars trajectory, scan efficiency is maximized as spectral information
is obtained without intermediate preparation phases. A memory-efficient
reconstruction routine is implemented by introducing the low-frequency Fourier
transform as a subspace which allows for the formulation of a convex
reconstruction problem. The removal of banding artifacts is investigated by
comparing the proposed acquisition and reconstruction technique to phase-cycled
bSSFP MRI. Aliasing properties of different undersampling schemes are analyzed
and water/fat separation is demonstrated by reweighting the reconstructed
subspace coefficients to generate virtual spectral responses in a
post-processing step.
  Results: A simple root-of-sum-of-squares combination of the reconstructed
subspace coefficients yields high-SNR images with the characteristic bSSFP
contrast but without banding artifacts. Compared to Golden-Angle trajectories,
turn-based sampling schemes were superior in minimizing aliasing across
reconstructed subspace coefficients. Water/fat separated images of the human
knee were obtained by reweighting subspace coefficients.
  Conclusion: The novel subspace-based fmSSFP MRI technique emerges as a
time-efficient alternative to phase-cycled bSSFP. The method does not need
intermediate preparation phases, offers high SNR and avoids banding artifacts.
Reweighting of the reconstructed subspace coefficients allows for generating
virtual spectral responses with applications to water/fat separation.

in-plane thermal conductivity of thin film samples. Operating with the

resolution down to {\Delta}({\kappa}*t)=0.065 nm*W/(m*K), enabling accurate
measurements. Validation of the sensor performance is done with organic and
metallic thin films. In both cases, at early stages of growth, we observe an
initial reduction of the effective thermal conductance of the supporting
amorphous membrane, K, related with the surface phonon scattering enhanced by
the incipient nanoclusters formation. As clusters develop, K reaches a minimum
at the percolation threshold. Subsequent island percolation produces a sharp
increase of the conductance and once the surface coverage is completed K
increases linearly with thickness The thermal conductivity of the deposited
films is obtained from the variation of K with thickness.

the two types is at $C=1$ where the cones are tipped and there is a Lifshitz
transition. The topological charge of a WSM is one. In multi-Weyl it can be two
or more depending on the value of the winding number $J$. We calculate the
absorptive part of the AC optical conductivity both along the tilt direction
($\sigma_{zz}$) and perpendicular to it ($\sigma_{xx}$) as a function of the
tilt ($C$) and chemical potential ($\mu$). For zero tilt there is a
discontinuous rise in both $\sigma_{xx}$ and $\sigma_{zz}$ at photon energy
$\Omega=2\mu$ followed by the usual linear in $\Omega$ law for $\sigma_{xx}$ at
$J=1,2$ and $\sigma_{zz}$ at $J=1$. For $J=2$ and $\sigma_{zz}$ the interband
background is constant rather than linear in $\Omega$. For type I there is a
readjustment of optical spectral weight as the tilt is increased. The
absorption starts from zero at $2\mu/(1+C)$ and then rises in a quasilinear
fashion till it merge with the usual undoped untilted interband background at
$2\mu/(1-C)$. The discontinuous rise at twice the chemical potential of the
untilted case is lost. For type II the interband background of the undoped
untilted case is never recovered. For noncentrosymmetric materials the energies
of a pair of opposite chirality Weyl nodes become shifted by $\pm Q_{0}$ and
this leads to two separate absorption edges corresponding to the effective
chemical potential of each of the two nodes at $2(\mu+\chi Q_{0})$ depending on
chirality $\chi=\pm$. We provide analytic expressions for the conductivity in
this case which depend only on the ratio $Q_{0}/\mu$ and tilt when plotted
against $\Omega/\mu$. The signature of finite energy shift $Q_{0}$ is more
pronounced for $\sigma_{zz}$ and $J=2$ than for the other cases.

these different applications on three major deep learning frameworks

premise of VQA's significance as a benchmark in AI, is that both the image and
textual question need to be well understood and mutually grounded in order to
infer the correct answer. However, current VQA models perhaps `understand' less
than initially hoped, and instead master the easier task of exploiting cues
given away in the question and biases in the answer distribution. In this paper
we propose the inverse problem of VQA (iVQA). The iVQA task is to generate a
question that corresponds to a given image and answer pair. We propose a
variational iVQA model that can generate diverse, grammatically correct and
content correlated questions that match the given answer. Based on this model,
we show that iVQA is an interesting benchmark for visuo-linguistic
understanding, and a more challenging alternative to VQA because an iVQA model
needs to understand the image better to be successful. As a second
contribution, we show how to use iVQA in a novel reinforcement learning
framework to diagnose any existing VQA model by way of exposing its belief set:
the set of question-answer pairs that the VQA model would predict true for a
given image. This provides a completely new window into what VQA models
`believe' about images. We show that existing VQA models have more erroneous
beliefs than previously thought, revealing their intrinsic weaknesses.
Suggestions are then made on how to address these weaknesses going forward.

$r_{j_i,k_i}, i\in [1,M]$ has been in use. We realize that the suggested form
is the conventional Pearson's coefficient for $\{(j_i,k_i), (k_i,j_i)\}$ for
$2M$ data points and hence it is rightly dedicated to undirected networks.

spin-1 BEC, where spin and mass superfluidity coexist in the presence of
uniaxial anisotropy (linear and quadratic Zeeman effect). The analysis is based
on hydrodynamics following from the Gross-Pitaevskii theory. Cores of
nonsingular vortices are skyrmions with charge, which is tuned by uniaxial
anisotropy and can have any fractal value between 0 and 1. There are
circulations of mass and spin currents around these vortices. The results are
compared with the equation of vortex motion derived earlier in the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory for magnetic vortices in easy-plane
ferromagnetic insulators. In the both cases the transverse gyrotropic force
(analog of the Magnus force in superfluid and classical hydrodynamics) is
proportional to the charge of skyrmions in vortex cores.

  perceived ages of people aged 3-100","12 pages, 3 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many developed countries, human life expectancy has doubled over the last
180 years from ~40 to ~80 years. Underlying this great advance is a change in
how we age, yet our understanding of this change remains limited. Here we
present a unique database rich with possibilities to study the human ageing
process: the AgeGuess.org database on people's perceived and chronological
ages. Perceived age (i.e. how old one looks to others) correlates with
biological age, a measure of a person's health condition in comparison to the
average of same-aged peers. Determining biological age usually involves
elaborate molecular and cellular biomarkers. Using instead perceived age as a
biomarker of biological age enables us to collect large amounts of data on
biological age through a citizen science project, where people upload pictures
of themselves and guess the ages of other people at http://www.ageguess.org. It
furthermore allows to collect data retrospectively, because people can upload
photographs of themselves when they were younger or of their parents and
grandparents. We can thus study the temporal variation in the gap between
perceived age and chronological age to address questions such as whether we now
age slower or delay ageing until older ages. The here presented perceived age
data span birth cohorts from the years 1877 to 2014. Since 2012 the database
has grown to now contain around 200,000 perceived age guesses. More than 4000
citizen scientists from over 120 countries of origin have uploaded ~5000 facial
photographs. We detail how the data are collected, where the data can be
downloaded free of charge, and the contained variables. Beyond ageing research,
the data present a wealth of possibilities to study how humans guess ages and
to use this knowledge for instance in advancing and testing emerging
applications of artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms.

pedestrian motion near intersections for safe and efficient trajectory
planning. We are interested in developing transfer learning algorithms that can
be trained on the pedestrian trajectories collected at one intersection and yet
still provide accurate predictions of the trajectories at another, previously
unseen intersection. We first discussed the feature selection for transferable
pedestrian motion models in general. Following this discussion, we developed
one transferable pedestrian motion prediction algorithm based on Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) that infers pedestrian intentions and predicts
future trajectories based on observed trajectory. We evaluated our algorithm on
a dataset collected at two intersections, trained at one intersection and
tested at the other intersection. We used the accuracy of augmented
semi-nonnegative sparse coding (ASNSC), trained and tested at the same
intersection as a baseline. The result shows that the proposed algorithm
improves the baseline accuracy by 40% in the non-transfer task, and 16% in the
transfer task.

properties of the particle correctly, is in the present paper shown to be also
able to explain quantum interference by classical probabilities. According to
this model, the electron is not point-like, but rather an ""entity"" formed by a
fast periodic motion of a quantum whose energy is equal to the rest energy of
the electron. Only after a time span equal to the period of that periodic
motion the ""entity"" becomes the electron, with its properties, mass, spin,
charge, etc.. When in motion with respect to the observer, the ""dynamic
substructure"" of the electron described in this way, leads to a certain time
structure of its detection probability, if the space-time point of detection is
taken as the space-time point of the quantum. In the typical ""two slit""
experimental situation, this leads to a periodic detection probability with a
frequency of twice the De Broglie frequency. This result is identical to the
result obtained by the quantum mechanical description of the moving electron by
the free particle wave function. The different interpretations of the
established interference pattern, inherent in the two alternative theoretical
descriptions is outlined, and the relation between the two descriptions
discussed. It is concluded that quantum interference is well explained with
classical probabilities, without quantum mechanics and without paradoxes. In
view of the demonstrated merits of the model on the one hand, and the new
aspects regarding the established theories it implies on the other, a more
thorough investigation of its role in relation to relativistic quantum
mechanics, and to quantum field theory is suggested. Some of the interesting
aspects are summarized.

useful when combined with other polymers to make polymer composites. The
appealing features of these materials come from their having comparable levels
of strength and endurance to what one would find in metal alloys while being
more lightweight and economical. However, these materials are still susceptible
to degradation over time and so it is of great importance to manufacturers to
assess their product's lifetime. Because these materials are meant to last over
a span of several years or even decades, accelerated testing is often the
method of choice in assessing product lifetimes in a more feasible time frame.
In this article, a brief introduction is given to the methods of accelerated
testing and analysis used with polymer materials. Special attention is given to
degradation testing and modeling due to the growing popularity of these
techniques along with a brief discussion of fatigue testing. References are
provided for further reading in each of these areas.
