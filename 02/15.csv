used both for object/surface modelling in computer graphics and as object-part
representation in computer vision and robotics. Superquadrics refer to a family
of shapes: here we deal with the superellipsoids and superparaboloids. Due to
the strong non-linearities involved in the equations, uniform or
close-to-uniform sampling is not attainable through a naive approach of direct
sampling from the parametric formulation. This is specially true for more
`cubic' superquadrics (with shape parameters close to $0.1$). We extend a
previous solution of 2D close-to-uniform uniform sampling of superellipses to
the superellipsoid (3D) case and derive our own for the superparaboloid.
Additionally, we are able to provide normals for each sampled point. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first complete approach for close-to-uniform
sampling of superellipsoids and superparaboloids in one single framework. We
present derivations, pseudocode and qualitative and quantitative results using

provides a unified view that covers two well-known magnetic field dependent

quasiparticle generation is the dominant loss mechanism for parallel magnetic
fields. For perpendicular fields, the dominant loss mechanism is vortex motion
or switches from quasiparticle generation to vortex motion, depending on
cooling procedures. In particular, we introduce a plot of the quality factor
versus the resonance frequency as a general method for identifying the dominant

factor as a function of the magnetic field by modeling the complex resistivity.
Key parameters characterizing microwave loss are estimated from comparisons of
the observed and expected resonator properties. Based on these key parameters,
we find a niobium resonator whose thickness is similar to its penetration depth
is the best choice for X-band electron spin resonance applications. Finally, we
detect partial release of the Meissner current at the vortex penetration field,

cause the electron motion to significantly deviate from their Larmor orbits.
Collectively these orbits affect the electron velocity distribution function
and lead to the appearance of the ""non-gyrotropic"" elements in the pressure
tensor. Quantification of this effect has important applications in space and
laboratory plasma, one of which is tracing the electron diffusion region (EDR)
of magnetic reconnection in space observations. Three different measures of
agyrotropy of pressure tensor have previously been proposed, namely,
$A\varnothing_e$, $D_{ng}$ and $Q$. The multitude of contradictory measures has
caused confusion within the community. We revisit the problem by considering
the basic properties an agyrotropy measure should have. We show that
$A\varnothing_e$, $D_{ng}$ and $Q$ are all defined based on the sum of the
principle minors (i.e. the rotation invariant $I_2$) of the pressure tensor. We
discuss in detail the problems of $I_2$-based measures and explain why they may
produce ambiguous and biased results. We introduce a new measure $AG$
constructed based on the determinant of the pressure tensor (i.e. the rotation
invariant $I_3$) which does not suffer from the problems of $I_2$-based
measures. We compare $AG$ with other measures in 2 and 3-dimension
particle-in-cell magnetic reconnection simulations, and show that $AG$ can
effectively trace the EDR of reconnection in both Harris and force-free current
sheets. On the other hand, $A\varnothing_e$ does not show prominent peaks in
the EDR and part of the separatrix in the force-free reconnection simulations,
demonstrating that $A\varnothing_e$ does not measure all the non-gyrotropic
effects in this case, and is not suitable for studying magnetic reconnection in
more general situations other than Harris sheet reconnection.

The capsids of many positive-sense RNA viruses spontaneously assemble from in
vitro mixtures of the coat protein and RNA. The high yield of proper capsids
that assemble is remarkable, given their structural complexity: 180 identical
proteins must arrange into three distinct local configurations to form an
icosahedral capsid with a triangulation number of 3 (T = 3). Despite a wealth
of data from structural studies and simulations, even the most fundamental
questions about how these structures assemble remain unresolved. Experiments
have not determined whether the assembly pathway involves aggregation or
nucleation, or how the RNA controls the process. Here we use interferometric
scattering microscopy to directly observe the in vitro assembly kinetics of
individual, unlabeled capsids of bacteriophage MS2. By measuring how many coat
proteins bind to individual MS2 RNA strands over time scales from 1 ms to 900
s, we find that the start of assembly is broadly distributed in time and is
followed by a rapid increase in the number of bound proteins. These
measurements provide strong evidence for a nucleation-and-growth pathway. We
also find that malformed structures assemble when multiple nuclei appear on the
same RNA before the first nucleus has finished growing. Our measurements reveal
the complex assembly pathways for viral capsids around RNA in quantitative
detail, including the nucleation threshold, nucleation time, growth time, and
constraints on the critical nucleus size. These results may inform strategies

What distinguishes EVSL from other currently available packages is that EVSL

  interaction",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A mechanistic theory of wind-wave interaction must rely on verifiable
assumptions and offer reproducible observable predictions. For decades, the
limited mechanistic grasp on the problem has motivated RANS and LES modeling
and has driven a vast empirical effort to describe the interaction in terms of
wave-induced modifications of standard statistical characteristics of the wind,
such as wind profile, kinetic energy balance or exchange coefficients. Because
the mechanistic, empirical and numerical approaches are all concerned with the
same phenomenon occurring in the same media, consistency here requires that the
assumptions on which the approaches rest and the predictions they generate are
compatible with each other and supported by measurements. Recent findings from
theoretical analysis and field experiments advanced the understanding of the
statistical and dynamic patterns of the wave-coherent flow, which is at the
core of the mechanistic description of the wind-wave exchange. The progress
prompts reexamining of earlier concepts, efforts and findings to evaluate their
suitability, validity and usefulness. For the purpose, this survey traces the
development of ideas, methods and results in the study of the wind wave
generation.

and engineering problems. Shallow flow models allow capturing the free surface
of the fluid with little effort and reducing the three-dimensional problem to a
quasi two-dimensional problem through depth-integrating the flow fields.
Despite remarkable progress of such models in the last decade, accurate
description of complex topography remains a challenge. Interaction with
topography is particularly critical for granular flows, because their rheology
requires modeling of the pressure field, which is strongly linked to surface
curvature and associated centrifugal forces. Shallow granular flow models are
usually set up in surface-aligned curvilinear coordinates, and velocity is
represented as a two-dimensional surface-aligned vector field. The
transformation from Cartesian to curvilinear coordinates introduces fictitious
forces, however, which result in complex governing equations. In this paper, we
set up the shallow flow model in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates and
preserve three-dimensional velocity in the depth-integrated model. Topography
is taken into account with a constraint on velocity. This approach is commonly
applied by the thin liquid film community. The advantage is a curvature-free
mathematical description that is convenient for complex topographies. The
constraint on velocity yields a solution for the pressure field, which is
required for the pressure-dependent rheology of granular materials. The model
is therefore well-suited for granular flows on three-dimensional terrain, e.g.,
avalanches.

  Systems (MASS): http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8108770/",,"10.1109/MASS.2017.50",,"math.OC eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the problem of target localization in the presence of outlying
sensors is tackled. This problem is important in practice because in many
real-world applications the sensors might report irrelevant data
unintentionally or maliciously. The problem is formulated by applying robust
statistics techniques on squared range measurements and two different
approaches to solve the problem are proposed. The first approach is
computationally efficient; however, only the objective convergence is
guaranteed theoretically. On the other hand, the whole-sequence convergence of
the second approach is established. To enjoy the benefit of both approaches,
they are integrated to develop a hybrid algorithm that offers computational
efficiency and theoretical guarantees. The algorithms are evaluated for
different simulated and real-world scenarios. The numerical results show that
the proposed methods meet the Cr'amer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for a sufficiently
large number of measurements. When the number of the measurements is small, the
proposed position estimator does not achieve CRLB though it still outperforms
several existing localization methods.

measurements of hadronic data, with particular focus on determinations of the
strong coupling constant. We show that when the PDF dependency on the
determination is adequately taken into account, the dispersion between the
results from different measurements is significantly reduced. We speculatively
propose the concept of preferred value of a parameter from a particular
dataset.

those Higgs bundles obtained by pushforward under an unramified cover. We equip
these loci with a hyperholomorphic bundle so that they can be viewed as
BBB-branes, and we introduce corresponding BAA-branes which can be described
via Hecke modifications. We then show how these branes are naturally dual via
explicit Fourier--Mukai transform, where we recall that the structure group
$\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})$ is Langlands self dual. It is noteworthy that these
branes lie over the singular locus of the Hitchin fibration.
  As a particular case, our construction describes the behaviour under mirror
symmetry of the fixed loci for the action of tensorization by a line bundle of
order $n$. These loci play a key role in the work of Hausel and Thaddeus on
topological mirror symmetry for Higgs moduli spaces.

conversion in which two low-energy photons can promote an electron to the
conduction band through a so-called intermediate band. To limit recombination
and preserve the photo-generated voltage, generation to- and from the
intermediate band should be matched. However, all practical realizations
experienced a significant voltage degradation as compared to a single junction
without intermediate band. In this work, we develop a novel analytical
optimization method based on Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate that an
Intermediate Band Solar Cell under solar spectrum cannot meet voltage
preservation and current matching at the same time. By contrast, we show that
the implementation of an energy shift (\emph{electronic ratchet}) in any of the
bands allows those two criteria to be filled simultaneously. Additional
insights are provided by the numerical study of the short circuit current and
fill factor of the systems at stake, which show that a system with ratchet
benefits from the same current increase as a standard Intermediate Band Solar
Cell (same short-circuit current), while maintaining I-V properties of a single
junction (same open-voltage circuit, same fill factor).

fixed cost between two vertices. This paper focuses on the exact path problem
for costs $-1,0$ or $+1$ between all pairs of vertices in an edge-weighted
digraph. The edge weights are from $\{ -1, +1 \}$. In this case, this paper
gives an $\widetilde{O}(n^{\omega})$ exact path solution. Here $\omega$ is the
best exponent for matrix multiplication and $\widetilde{O}$ is the asymptotic
upper-bound mod polylog factors.
  Variations of this algorithm determine which pairs of digraph nodes have Dyck
or semi-Dyck labeled paths between them, assuming two parenthesis. Therefore,
determining digraph reachability for Dyck or semi-Dyck labeled paths costs
$\widetilde{O}(n^{\omega})$. A path label is made by concatenating all symbols
along the path's edges.
  The exact path length problem has many applications. These applications
include the labeled path problems given here, which in turn, also have numerous
applications.

fluid dynamical objective functions have been used for a long time. As peak
stress is not a differential func- tional of the shape, such highly efficient
procedures so far have been missing for objective functionals that stem from
mechan- ical integrity. This changes, if deterministic lifing criteria are
replaced by probabilistic criteria, which have been introduced recently to the
field of low cycle fatigue (LCF). Here we present a finite element (FEA) based
first discretize, then adjoin approach to the calculation of shape gradients
(sen- sitivities) for the failure probability with regard to probabilistic LCF
and apply it to simple and complex geometries, as e.g. a blisk geometry. We
review the computation of failure probabilities with a FEA postprocessor and
sketch the computation of the relevant quantities for the adjoint method. We
demonstrate high accuracy and computational efficiency of the adjoint method
compared to finite difference schemes. We discuss implementation details for
rotating components with cyclic boundary conditions. Finally, we shortly
comment on future development steps and on poten- tial applications in multi
criteria optimization.

potential scattering. This is because the scattering boundary conditions for
all short-range potentials are the same, but for different long-range
potentials are different. In this paper, by introducing tortoise coordinates,
we convert long-range potential scattering to short-range potential scattering.
This allows us to deal with long-range potential scattering as short-range
potential scattering. An explicit expression of the scattering wave function
for long-range potential scattering is presented, in which the scattering wave
function is represented by the tortoise coordinate and the scattering phase
shift. We show that the long-range potential scattering wave function is just
the short-range potential scattering wave function with a replacement of a
common coordinate by a tortoise coordinate. The approach applies not only to
scattering but also applies to bound states. Furthermore, in terms of tortoise
coordinates, we suggest a classification scheme for potentials. We also discuss
the duality between tortoise coordinates.

their plan is, i.e. what action sequence we should expect. In others, they
might leave us less confident, or even lead us to the wrong conclusion. Our
goal is for robot actions to fall in the first category: we want to enable
robots to select their actions in such a way that human collaborators can
easily use them to correctly anticipate what will follow. While previous work
has focused on finding initial plans that convey a set goal, here we focus on
finding two portions of a plan such that the initial portion conveys the final
one. We introduce $t$-\ACty{}: a measure that quantifies the accuracy and
confidence with which human observers can predict the remaining robot plan from
the overall task goal and the observed initial $t$ actions in the plan. We
contribute a method for generating $t$-predictable plans: we search for a full
plan that accomplishes the task, but in which the first $t$ actions make it as
easy as possible to infer the remaining ones. The result is often different
from the most efficient plan, in which the initial actions might leave a lot of
ambiguity as to how the task will be completed. Through an online experiment
and an in-person user study with physical robots, we find that our approach
outperforms a traditional efficiency-based planner in objective and subjective

of spectrum sensors is studied. The problem of selecting K sensor measurements
from a set of M potential sensors is considered where K << M. In addition, K
may be less than the dimension of the unknown variables of estimation. Through
sensor selection, we reduce the problem to an under-determined system of
equations with potentially infinite number of solutions. However, the sparsity
of the underlying data facilitates limiting the set of solutions to a unique
solution. Sparsity enables employing the emerging compressive sensing
technique, where the compressed measurements are selected from a large number
of potential sensors. This paper suggests selecting sensors in a way that the
reduced system of equations constructs a well-conditioned measurement matrix.
Our criterion for sensor selection is based on E-optimalily, which is highly
related to the restricted isometry property that provides some guarantees for
sparse solution obtained by L1 minimization. Moreover, the proposed framework
exploits a feedback mechanism to evolve the selected sensors dynamically over
time. The evolution aims to maximize the reliability of the sensed spectrum.

above trademarks. With these ideas in mind, we investigate the fundamental
ingredients underpinning the discontinuous transition in one of the simplest
systems with up-down $Z_2$ symmetry recently ascertained in [Phys. Rev. E {\bf

inertia- has its continuous transition being switched to a discontinuous one in
complex networks. We scrutinize the role of three fundamental ingredients:
inertia, system degree, and the lattice topology. Our analysis has been carried
out for regular lattices and random regular networks with different node
degrees (interacting neighborhood) through mean-field treatment and numerical
simulations. Our findings reveal that not only the inertia but also the
connectivity constitute essential elements for shifting the phase transition.
Astoundingly, they also manifest in low-dimensional regular topologies,
exposing a scaling behavior entirely different than those from the complex
networks case. Therefore, our findings put on firmer bases the essential issues

lensing-induced shear fields across the sky. Recently, the Dark Energy Survey
(DES) collaboration used a joint fit to two-point correlations between these
observables to place tight constraints on cosmology (DES Collaboration et al.
2017). In this work, we develop the methodology to extend the DES year one
joint probes analysis to include cross-correlations of the optical survey
observables with gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
as measured by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck. Using simulated
analyses, we show how the resulting set of five two-point functions increases
the robustness of the cosmological constraints to systematic errors in galaxy
lensing shear calibration. Additionally, we show that contamination of the
SPT+Planck CMB lensing map by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect is a
potentially large source of systematic error for two-point function analyses,
but show that it can be reduced to acceptable levels in our analysis by masking
clusters of galaxies and imposing angular scale cuts on the two-point
functions. The methodology developed here will be applied to the analysis of
data from the DES, the SPT, and Planck in a companion work.

astronomical observations provides a promising avenue for probing the particle
nature of DM. In the case of DM consisting of Weakly-Interacting Massive
Particles (WIMPs), self-annihilation ultimately produces observable products
including $e^{\pm}$ pairs and gamma rays. The gamma rays can be detected
directly, while the $e^{\pm}$ pairs can be detected by radio emission from
synchrotron radiation or X-rays and soft gamma rays from inverse Compton
scattering. An intriguing region to search for astrophysical signs of DM is the
Galactic center (GC) of the Milky Way, due in part to an observed excess of
gamma-rays that could be DM. A recent observation by the Fermi-LAT
collaboration of a similar excess in the central region of the Andromeda galaxy
(M31) leads us to explore the possibility of a DM-induced signal there as well.
We use the RX-DMFIT tool to perform a multi-frequency analysis of potential DM
annihilation emissions in M31. We consider WIMP models consistent with the GC
excess and calculate the expected emission across the electromagnetic spectrum
in comparison with available observational data from M31. We find that the
particle models that best fit the M31 excess favor lower masses than the GC
excess. The best fitting models are for a $b\bar{b}$ final state with
$M_{\chi}=11$ GeV and $\left<\sigma v\right>=2.6\times 10^{-26}$
cm$^3$s$^{-1}$, as well as an evenly mixed $b\bar{b}/\tau^+\tau^-$ final state
with $M_{\chi}=5.8$ GeV and $\left<\sigma v\right>=2.03\times 10^{-26}$
cm$^3$s$^{-1}$. For conservative estimates of the diffusion and magnetic field
models the expected radio emissions appear to be in tension with currently
available data in the central region of M31, although this constraint has a
fairly strong dependence on the values chosen for parameters describing the
magnetic field strength and geometry.

This distinction between tree-like vs. dag-like structure is particularly
relevant when making quantitative considerations regarding, for example, proof
size. Here we analyze a more general type of structural restriction for proofs
in rule-based proof systems. In this definition, proofs are directed graphs of
derived formulas in which cycles are allowed as long as every formula is
derived at least as many times as it is required as a premise. We call such
proofs ""circular"". We show that, for all sets of standard inference rules with
single or multiple conclusions, circular proofs are sound. We start the study
of the proof complexity of circular proofs at Circular Resolution, the circular
version of Resolution. We immediately see that Circular Resolution is stronger
than Dag-like Resolution since, as we show, the propositional encoding of the
pigeonhole principle has circular Resolution proofs of polynomial size.
Furthermore, for derivations of clauses from clauses, we show that Circular
Resolution is, surprisingly, equivalent to Sherali-Adams, a proof system for
reasoning through polynomial inequalities that has linear programming at its
base. As corollaries we get: 1) polynomial-time (LP-based) algorithms that find
Circular Resolution proofs of constant width, 2) examples that separate
Circular from Dag-like Resolution, such as the pigeonhole principle and its
variants, and 3) exponentially hard cases for Circular Resolution. Contrary to
the case of Circular Resolution, for Frege we show that circular proofs can be
converted into tree-like proofs with at most polynomial overhead.

just like light, thereby magnifying binary merging events in the far Universe.
High magnification by galaxies is found to be responsible for the brightest
sources detected in sky surveys, but the low angular resolution of LIGO/Virgo
is insufficient to check this lensing possibility directly. Here we find that
the first six binary black hole (BBH) merging events reported by LIGO/Virgo
show clear evidence for lensing in the plane of observed mass and source
distance. The four lowest frequency events follow an apparent locus in this
plane, which we can reproduce by galaxy lensing, where the higher the
magnification, the generally more distant the source so the wave train is
stretched more by the Universal expansion, by factors of 2-4. This revises the
reported BBH distances upwards by an order of magnitude, equal to the square
root of the magnification. Furthermore, the reported black hole masses must be
decreased by 2-4 to counter the larger stretch factor, since the orbital
frequency is used to derive the black hole masses. This lowers the masses to
5-15 solar masses, well below the puzzlingly high values of 20-35 solar masses
otherwise estimated, with the attraction of finding agreement in mass with
black holes orbiting stars in our own Galaxy, thereby implying a stellar origin
for the low frequency events in the far Universe. We also show that the other
two BBH events of higher frequency detected by LIGO/VIRGO, lie well below the
lensing locus, consistent with being nearby and unlensed. If this apparent
division between local and distant lensed events is reinforced by new
detections then the spins and masses of stellar black holes can be compared
over a timespan of 10 billion years by LIGO/Virgo.

gravitational tug-boat mechanism can explain these kicks as consequences of
asymmetric mass ejection during the supernova (SN) explosion. Support for this
hydrodynamic explanation is provided by observations of SN remnants with
associated NSs, which confirm the prediction that the bulk of the explosion
ejecta, in particular chemical elements between silicon and the iron group, are
dominantly expelled in the hemisphere opposite to the direction of the NS kick.
Here, we present a large set of two- and three-dimensional explosion
simulations of electron-capture SNe, considering explosion energies between
~3x10^49 erg and ~1.6x10^50 erg. We find that the fast acceleration of the SN
shock in the steep density gradient delimiting the O-Ne-Mg core of the
progenitor enables such a rapid expansion of neutrino-heated matter that the
growth of neutrino-driven convection freezes out quickly in a high-mode
spherical harmonics pattern. Since the corresponding momentum asymmetry of the
ejecta is very small and the gravitational acceleration by the fast-expanding
ejecta abates rapidly, the NS kick velocities are at most a few km/s. The
extremely low core compactness of O-Ne-Mg-core progenitors therefore favors
hydrodynamic NS kicks much below the ~160 km/s measured for the Crab pulsar.
This suggests either that the Crab Nebula is not the remnant of an
electron-capture SN, but of a low-mass iron-core progenitor, or that the Crab
pulsar was not accelerated by the gravitational tug-boat mechanism but received
its kick by a non-hydrodynamic mechanism such as, e.g., anisotropic neutrino
emission.

\text{AU} \right)$ around RY Lupi, with spectra from HST-COS, HST-STIS, and
VLT-CRIRES. We model the radial distribution of flux from hot gas in a surface
layer between $r = 0.1-10$ AU, as traced by Ly$\alpha$-pumped H$_2$. The result
shows H$_2$ emission originating in a ring centered at $\sim$3 AU that declines
within $r < 0.1$ AU, which is consistent with the behavior of disks with dust
cavities. An analysis of the H$_2$ line shapes shows that a two-component
Gaussian profile $\left(\text{FWHM}_{broad, H_2} = 105 \pm 15 \, \text{km
s}^{-1}; \, \text{FWHM}_{narrow, H_2} = 43 \pm 13 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \right)$
is statistically preferred to a single-component Gaussian. We interpret this as
tentative evidence for gas emitting from radially separated disk regions
$\left( \left \langle r_{broad, H_2} \right \rangle \sim 0.4 \pm 0.1 \,
\text{AU}; \, \left \langle r_{narrow, H_2} \right \rangle \sim 3 \pm 2 \,

0.4 \pm 0.1 \, \text{AU}; \, \left \langle r_{narrow, CO} \right \rangle = 15
\pm 2 \, \text{AU} \right)$. We combine these results with 10 $\mu$m
observations to form a picture of gapped structure within the mm-imaged dust

confirm the gap with K2 candidates or validated planets. This work, in addition
to increasing the population of validated K2 planets by nearly 50% and
providing new targets for follow-up observations, will also serve as a

crust was heated during the $\sim$4.5 month accretion outburst of the source.
From our quiescent observations, fitting the spectra with a neutron star

$\sim$73 eV from $\sim$8 days to $\sim$479 days after the end of its outburst.
However, during the most recent observation, taken $\sim$860 days after the end

This suggested that the crust had returned to thermal equilibrium with the

shallow heat source, in addition to the standard deep crustal heating
processes, contributing $\sim$0.9 MeV per accreted nucleon during outburst to

it learns to generate molecules that maximize the value of certain property of

dynamics are found to be preserved up to a single exponential damping factor.
This is a consequence of the interplay between $\mathbb{PT}$ symmetry and weak
symmetries, which strengthens previous predictions for $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetric
Liouvillian dynamics. Requirements are a non-degenerate $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetric
generator of time evolution $\hat{\mathcal{L}}$, a weak parity symmetry and an
observable that is anti-symmetric under this parity transformation. The
spectrum of $\hat{\mathcal{L}}$ then splits up into symmetry sectors, yielding
the same decay rate for all modes that contribute to the observable's time
evolution. This phenomenon may be realized in trapped ion experiments and has
possible implications for the control of decoherence in out-of-equilibrium
many-body systems.

properly understood and controlled. Here we report on a detailed and systematic
investigation of transition-metal (TM)-doped Sb$_2$Te$_3$. By combining density
functional theory (DFT) calculations with complementary experimental
techniques, i.e., scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), resonant photoemission

results reveal that the TM dopants not only affect the magnetic state of the
host material, but also significantly alter the electronic structure by
generating impurity-derived energy bands. Our findings demonstrate the
existence of a delicate interplay between electronic and magnetic properties in
TM-doped TIs. In particular, we find that the fate of the topological surface
states critically depends on the specific character of the TM impurity: while
V- and Fe-doped Sb$_2$Te$_3$ display resonant impurity states in the vicinity
of the Dirac point, Cr and Mn impurities leave the energy gap unaffected. The
single-ion magnetic anisotropy energy and easy axis, which control the magnetic
gap opening and its stability, are also found to be strongly TM
impurity-dependent and can vary from in-plane to out-of-plane depending on the
impurity and its distance from the surface. Overall, our results provide
general guidelines for the realization of a robust QAHE in TM-doped
Sb$_2$Te$_3$ in the ferromagnetic state.

formulate the problem of influential users subscription on time-decaying social

monitoring changes in MOT fluorescence. By measuring the ionization rate via
these two independent methods, we have enough information to directly determine
the population of MOT atoms in the excited-state. The resulting measurement
reveals that there is a range of trapping-laser intensities where the

clearly resolve two distinct emission peaks separated by 24 meV from an ILE in

common character, and have opposite circular polarizations when excited with
circularly polarized light. Ab initio calculations successfully account for
these observations - they show that both emission features originate from
excitonic transitions that are indirect in momentum space, are split by
spin-orbit coupling, and that including interlayer hybridization is essential
in correctly describing the ILE transition. Although well separated in momentum
space, we find that in real space the electron has significant weight in both

loss function based on the $F$ statistic, which describes the separation of two
or more distributions. By ensuring that distinct classes are well separated on
a subset of embedding dimensions, we obtain embeddings that are useful for
few-shot learning. By not requiring separation on all dimensions, we encourage
the discovery of disentangled representations. Our embedding method matches or
beats state-of-the-art, as evaluated by performance on recall@$k$ and few-shot
learning tasks. Our method also obtains performance superior to a variety of
alternatives on disentangling, as evaluated by two key properties of a
disentangled representation: modularity and explicitness. The goal of our work
is to obtain more interpretable, manipulable, and generalizable deep
representations of concepts and categories.

interactions with the environment. Current approaches to learning from
demonstration and reward perform supervised learning on expert demonstration
data and use reinforcement learning to further improve performance based on the
reward received from the environment. These tasks have divergent losses which
are difficult to jointly optimize and such methods can be very sensitive to
noisy demonstrations. We propose a unified reinforcement learning algorithm,
Normalized Actor-Critic (NAC), that effectively normalizes the Q-function,
reducing the Q-values of actions unseen in the demonstration data. NAC learns
an initial policy network from demonstrations and refines the policy in the
environment, surpassing the demonstrator's performance. Crucially, both
learning from demonstration and interactive refinement use the same objective,
unlike prior approaches that combine distinct supervised and reinforcement
losses. This makes NAC robust to suboptimal demonstration data since the method
is not forced to mimic all of the examples in the dataset. We show that our
unified reinforcement learning algorithm can learn robustly and outperform
existing baselines when evaluated on several realistic driving games.

that it serves as a fault-tolerance mechanism, which leads to redundancy's de

be engineered solely for enhancing other aspects of the system, namely accuracy

present a unified theory describing how such utilization of redundancy is
feasible through two complementary mechanisms: representational redundancy
(RPR) and entangled redundancy (ETR). Besides the previous works, we point out
two additional examples where our new understanding of redundancy can be
applied to justify a system's superior performance. One is the human
musculoskeletal system (HMS) - a biological instance, and one is the deep
residual neural network (ResNet) - an artificial counterpart. We envision that

simulations (LES) at a Reynolds number of $50,000$. The LES is able to capture
the time-dependent vortex shedding and dynamic stall properties of the foil as
it undergoes high relative angles of attack. Results of the computations are
validated against experimental flume data in terms of power extraction and
leading edge vortex (LEV) position and trajectory. The kinematics for optimal
efficiency are found in the range of heave amplitude $h_o/c=0.5-1$ and pitch
amplitude $\theta_o=60^{\circ}-65^{\circ}$ for $fc/U_{\infty}=0.1$ and of
$h_o/c=1-1.5$ and $\theta_o=75^{\circ}-85^{\circ}$ for $fc/U_{\infty}=0.15$.
Direct comparison with low Reynolds number simulations and experiments
demonstrate strong agreement in energy harvesting performance between Reynolds
numbers of $1000$ to $50,000$, with the high Reynolds number flows
demonstrating a moderate $0.8-6.7\%$ increase in power compared to the low
Reynolds number flow. In the high Reynolds number flows, the coherent LEV,
which is critical for high-efficiency energy conversion, forms earlier and is
slightly stronger, resulting in more power extraction. After the LEV is shed
from the foil, the LEV trajectory is demonstrated to be relatively independent
of Reynolds number, but has a very strong nonlinear dependence with kinematics.
It is shown that the LEV trajectories are highly influenced by the heave and
pitch amplitudes as well as the oscillation frequency. This has strong
implications for arrays of oscillating foils since the coherent LEVs can
influence the energy extraction efficiency and performance of downstream foils.

Learning a joint representation of these modalities should yield deeper and

input either do not learn a joint distribution or require additional
computation to handle missing data. Here, we introduce a multimodal variational
autoencoder (MVAE) that uses a product-of-experts inference network and a
sub-sampled training paradigm to solve the multi-modal inference problem.
Notably, our model shares parameters to efficiently learn under any combination
of missing modalities. We apply the MVAE on four datasets and match
state-of-the-art performance using many fewer parameters. In addition, we show
that the MVAE is directly applicable to weakly-supervised learning, and is
robust to incomplete supervision. We then consider two case studies, one of
learning image transformations---edge detection, colorization,
segmentation---as a set of modalities, followed by one of machine translation
between two languages. We find appealing results across this range of tasks.

  Learning","35 pages, 3 figures. Submitted for publication",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A grand challenge in representation learning is to learn the different
explanatory factors of variation behind the high dimen- sional data. Encoder
models are often determined to optimize performance on training data when the
real objective is to generalize well to unseen data. Although there is enough
numerical evidence suggesting that noise injection (during training) at the
representation level might improve the generalization ability of encoders, an
information-theoretic understanding of this principle remains elusive. This
paper presents a sample-dependent bound on the generalization gap of the
cross-entropy loss that scales with the information complexity (IC) of the
representations, meaning the mutual information between inputs and their
representations. The IC is empirically investigated for standard multi-layer
neural networks with SGD on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets; the behaviour of the
gap and the IC appear to be in direct correlation, suggesting that SGD selects
encoders to implicitly minimize the IC. We specialize the IC to study the role
of Dropout on the generalization capacity of deep encoders which is shown to be
directly related to the encoder capacity, being a measure of the
distinguishability among samples from their representations. Our results
support some recent regularization methods.

the adiabatic cooling effect of expanding plasma. There have been different
attempts of explaining this phenomena, including a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)

been routinely used in MARS spectral CT systems. These algorithms (known
collectively as MARS-MD) are based on a pragmatic heuristic for solving the
under-determined problem where there are more materials than energy bins. This
heuristic contains three parts: (1) splitting the problem into a number of
possible sub-problems, each containing fewer materials; (2) solving each
sub-problem; and (3) applying rejection criteria to eliminate all but one
sub-problem's solution. An advantage of this process is that different
constraints can be applied to each sub-problem if necessary. In addition, the
result of this process is that solutions will be sparse in the material domain,
which reduces crossover of signal between material images. Two algorithms based
on this process are presented: the Segmentation variant, which uses segmented
material classes to define each sub-problem; and the Angular Rejection variant,
which defines the rejection criteria using the angle between reconstructed
attenuation vectors.

PGCCs in the L1495 cloud with molecular lines and continuum data from Herschel,

of $T_{\rm d}$ = 11-14 K, and H$_{2}$ column densities of $N_{\rm H_{2}}$ =
0.36-2.5$\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. We found that not all PGCCs contain
prestellar objects. In general, the dense cores in PGCCs are usually at their
earliest evolutionary stages. All the dense cores have non-thermal velocity
dispersions larger than the thermal velocity dispersions from molecular line
data, suggesting that the dense cores may be turbulence-dominated. We have
calculated the virial parameter $\alpha$ and found that 14 of the dense cores
have $\alpha$ $<$ 2, while 16 of the dense cores have $\alpha$ $>$ 2. This
suggests that some of the dense cores are not bound in the absence of external
pressure and magnetic fields. The column density profiles of dense cores were
fitted. The sizes of the flat regions and core radii decrease with the
evolution of dense cores. CO depletion was found to occur in all the dense
cores, but is more significant in prestellar core candidates than in
protostellar or starless cores. The protostellar cores inside the PGCCs are
still at a very early evolutionary stage, sharing similar physical and chemical
properties with the prestellar core candidates.

low quality of training data and further significantly degrade the learning

some values may be recovered from the others. It is thus important to decide
which features are most informative for recovering the other features as well

effective classification model with least acquisition cost by jointly
performing active feature querying and supervised matrix completion. When
completing the feature matrix, a novel target function is proposed to
simultaneously minimize the reconstruction error on observed entries and the
supervised loss on training data. When querying the feature value, the most
uncertain entry is actively selected based on the variance of previous
iterations. In addition, a bi-objective optimization method is presented for

beam distribution and emittance growth, which may lead to beam loss. To match
the injection beam orbit and the circulating beam orbit, it is necessary to
identify the orbit of injection beam relative to the circulating orbit in the
injection point. However, it's hard to measure this relative injection orbit
directly. Theoretically, the relative injection beam orbit can be deduced by
measuring the turn-by-turn beam position of a single turn injection beam.
However, the intensity of single turn injected beam is too low to be measured
with sufficient signal-noise ratio by using beam position monitor(BPM). In this

  In this work we develop a framework for augmenting online algorithms with a
machine learned oracle to achieve competitive ratios that provably improve upon
unconditional worst case lower bounds when the oracle has low error. Our
approach treats the oracle as a complete black box, and is not dependent on its
inner workings, or the exact distribution of its errors.
  We apply this framework to the traditional caching problem -- creating an
eviction strategy for a cache of size $k$. We demonstrate that naively
following the oracle's recommendations may lead to very poor performance, even
when the average error is quite low. Instead we show how to modify the Marker
algorithm to take into account the oracle's predictions, and prove that this
combined approach achieves a competitive ratio that both (i) decreases as the
oracle's error decreases, and (ii) is always capped by $O(\log k)$, which can
be achieved without any oracle input. We complement our results with an
empirical evaluation of our algorithm on real world datasets, and show that it
performs well empirically even using simple off-the-shelf predictions.

issues are taken into account in the model: The alternating donor and acceptor
structure and the local imbalance of the intrinsic electrons and holes. The
alternating structure is beneficial for the direct generation of charge
transfer state which enhances the local imbalance of intrinsic charges. The
most remarkable outcome of the model is that, due to the strong Coulomb
attractive potential energy, the intrinsic charges in the cells are
self-accumulated in a small spatial region. Outside the self-accumulation
region, the charge density vanishes so that the recombination is regarded to be
largely suppressed. The photogenerated electrons are subsequently observed to
spread freely outside the self-accumulation region implying the Coulomb
attraction does not matter in the ultrafast charge separation dynamics. These
findings enable an appealing understanding of the high performance of emerging
nonfullerene cells, and the designing rules of molecules and devices are then

brittle elastic rods appear almost always to fragment into at least three
pieces when placed under large bending stresses. Feynman's observation raises
fundamental questions about the existence of protocols that can robustly induce
binary fracture in brittle materials. Using experiments, simulations and
analytical scaling arguments, we demonstrate controlled binary fracture of
brittle elastic rods for two distinct protocols based on twisting and
nonadiabatic quenching. Our experimental data for twist-controlled fracture
agree quantitatively with a theoretically predicted phase diagram. Furthermore,
we establish novel asymptotic scaling relations for quenched fracture. Due to
their general character, these results are expected to apply to torsional and
kinetic fracture processes in a wide range of systems.

magnetohydrodynamic turbulence that have a range of sonic and Alfv\'enic Mach

uniform polarized emission, and where the polarized emission originates from

oscillatory modes at millihertz frequencies, yet the source mechanism
responsible for driving these modes is still unknown. However, the energies
necessary to produce observable surface oscillations have been predicted. Here
we investigate if moist convection in Jupiter's upper atmosphere can be
responsible for driving the global oscillations and what moist convective
energy requirements are necessary to achieve these theoretical mode energies
and surface amplitudes. We begin by creating a one-dimensional moist convective
cloud model and find that the available kinetic energy of the rising cloud
column falls below theoretical estimates of oscillations energies. That is,
mode excitation cannot occur with a single storm eruption. We then explore
stochastic excitation scenarios of the oscillations by moist convective storms.
We find that mode energies and amplitudes can reach theoretical estimates if
the storm energy available to the modes is more than just kinetic. In order for
the modes to be excited, we find that they require $5 \times 10^{27}$ to
10$^{28}$ erg per day. However, even for a large storm eruption each day, the
available kinetic energy from the storms falls two orders of magnitude short of
the required driving energy. Although our models may oversimplify the true
complexity of the coupling between Jovian storms and global oscillations, our
findings reveal that enough thermal energy is associated with moist convection
to drive the modes, should it be available to them.

proven effective in closed-world experiments against privacy technologies like

open-world settings against clients that visit sensitive pages with a low base
rate. We find that this is because they have poor precision as they were
designed to maximize recall.
  In this work, we argue that precision is more important than recall for
open-world website fingerprinting. For this reason, we develop three classes of
{\em precision optimizers}, based on confidence, distance, and ensemble
learning, that can be applied to any classifier to increase precision. We test
them on known website fingerprinting attacks and show significant improvements
in precision. Against a difficult scenario, where the attacker wants to monitor
and distinguish 100 sensitive pages each with a low mean base rate of 0.00001,
our best optimized classifier can achieve a precision of 0.78; the highest
precision of any known attack before optimization was 0.014. We use precise
classifiers to tackle realistic objectives in website fingerprinting, including

engage themselves in technology, security has never been a greater concern. In
malware detection, static analysis, the method of analyzing potentially
malicious files, has been the prominent approach. This approach, however,
quickly falls short as malicious programs become more advanced and adopt the
capabilities of obfuscating its binaries to execute the same malicious
functions, making static analysis extremely difficult for newer variants. The
approach assessed in this paper is a novel dynamic malware analysis method,
which may generalize better than static analysis to newer variants. Inspired by
recent successes in Natural Language Processing (NLP), widely used document
classification techniques were assessed in detecting malware by doing such
analysis on system calls, which contain useful information about the operation
of a program as requests that the program makes of the kernel. Features
considered are extracted from system call traces of benign and malicious
programs, and the task to classify these traces is treated as a binary document
classification task of system call traces. The system call traces were
processed to remove the parameters to only leave the system call function
names. The features were grouped into various n-grams and weighted with Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. This paper shows that Linear Support
Vector Machines (SVM) optimized by Stochastic Gradient Descent and the
traditional Coordinate Descent on the Wolfe Dual form of the SVM are effective

combinatorial formula to express the simple elements of the dual braid monoids

lifting an $S$-reduced expression of its image in the Coxeter group, in a way
which involves Reading's $c$-sortable elements. It has as an immediate
consequence that simple dual braids are Mikado braids (the known proofs of this
result either require topological realizations of the Artin groups or
categorification techniques), and hence that their images in the Iwahori-Hecke

give an explicit description of the inverse of Reading's bijection from
$c$-sortable elements to noncrossing partitions of a Coxeter element $c$, which
might be of independent interest. The bijections are described in terms of the
noncrossing partition models in these types. While the proof of the formula is

overlayer), covering what is generally considered to be a dangerous site (from
the point of view of seismic hazard) lends itself to an explicit theoretical
analysis of its response to a seismic body wave radiated by distant sources.
This study is carried out for: ground response of the complete site/overlayer
configuration which is compared to the response of the configuration in which
the overlayer is absent, response at the top of the layer for various layer
thicknesses, and determination, as a function of frequency, of the fraction of
incident flux that is dissipated in the overlayer, the underlying layer and, by
radiation damping, in the hard half space. It is shown that all of these
entities are highly frequency-dependent and even large in certain frequency
intervals, without any resonant (in the sense of mode excitation) phenomena
coming into play. The results of this study also show that transfer functions
do not necessarily reflect the global response in the built component of a city
and that more-appropriate energy-related functions, termed spectral absorptance
(in the blocks of the city or their layer-like surrogate at the characteristic
frequency of the seismic pulse) and absorptance (integral over frequency of the
spectral absorptance), can increase with increasing city density or increasing
city height. In fact, it is shown that more than a third of the incident
seismic energy can be sent into, and therefore cause serious damage to, the
built component. On the basis of these findings, it appears that the probable
evolution of the morphology and constitutive properties of cities with time
will make the latter more vulnerable to damage and destruction when submitted
to seismic waves.

are useful in a variety of graph algorithms, such as clustering, anomaly
detection, and creating low dimensional embeddings. Since such measures hinge
on the spectral decomposition of the graph, the computation becomes a
bottleneck for large graphs and do not scale easily to graphs that cannot be
loaded in memory. Most existing graph mining libraries for large graphs either
resort to sampling or exploit the sparsity structure of such graphs for
spectral analysis. However, such methods do not work for dense graphs
constructed for studying pairwise relationships among entities in a data set.
Examples of such studies include analyzing pairwise locations in gridded
climate data for discovering long distance climate phenomena. These graphs
representations are fully connected by construction and cannot be sparsified
without loss of meaningful information. In this paper we describe CADDeLaG, a
framework for scalable computation of commute-time distance based anomaly
detection in large dense graphs without the need to load the entire graph in
memory. The framework relies on Apache Spark's memory-centric cluster-computing
infrastructure and consists of two building blocks: a decomposable algorithm
for commute time distance computation and a distributed linear system solver.
We illustrate the scalability of CADDeLaG and its dependency on various factors
using both synthetic and real world data sets. We demonstrate the usefulness of
CADDeLaG in identifying anomalies in a climate graph sequence, that have been
historically missed due to ad hoc graph sparsification and on an election

  Next, we introduce the notion of almost isolated horizons, which is weaker
than the usual notion of isolated horizons, since the geometry of the former is
not necessarily completely time-independent. Moreover, we allow the horizon to
be pierced by strings, thereby violating the usual assumption on the spherical
topology made in the definition of the weakly isolated horizon. Finally, we

We show that subtle changes in this motif can bring in drastically different

response in the gene expression changes to a bistable response as the
regulation on sRNA synthesis or degradation is altered. These results are
obtained under deterministic conditions. Next, we study how the gene expression
is altered by additive and multiplicative noise which might arise due to
probabilistic occurrences of different biochemical events. Using the
Fokker-Planck formulation, we obtain steady state probability distributions for
sRNA concentration for the network motifs displaying bistability. The
probability distributions are found to be bimodal with two peaks at low and
high concentrations of sRNAs. We further study the variations in the
probability distributions under different values of noise strength and

objective is a sum of a large number of possibly nonconvex functions, though
overall the objective is assumed to be smooth and convex. Our bid to solving
such model uses the framework of cubic regularization of Newton's method. As
well known, the crux in cubic regularization is its utilization of the Hessian
information, which may be computationally expensive for large-scale problems.
To tackle this, we resort to approximating the Hessian matrix via sub-sampling.
In particular, we propose to compute an approximated Hessian matrix by either
\textit{uniformly}\/ or \textit{non-uniformly}\/ sub-sampling the components of
the objective. Based upon such sampling strategy, we develop accelerated
adaptive cubic regularization approaches and provide theoretical guarantees on
global iteration complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-1/3})$ with high probability,
which matches that of the original accelerated cubic regularization methods

Interestingly, we show that in the worst case scenario our algorithm still
achieves an $O\left(\log(\epsilon^{-1})\epsilon^{-5/6}\right)$ iteration

biases inherent to Kepler mission data and the statistical properties of these

non-negligible fraction of main sequence {\delta} Sct stars exist outside
theoretical predictions of the classical instability boundaries, which
indicates the necessity of a mass-dependent mixing length parameter to
simultaneously explain low- and high-radial order pressure modes in {\delta}

{\delta} Sct stars, but that it is a valuable method for identifying the most
promising stars for mode identification and asteroseismic modelling. The full

photodetectors. We show that the statistical uncertainty depends on light
intensity, and on the method of evaluation. For some cases there is optimal
light intensity where the accuracy reaches its optimal value with fixed
statistics. A method of photoelectron evaluation based on the extraction of
pedestal's (zero) probability gives the best accuracy at approximately 1.6
photoelectrons for a noiseless photodetector and shifts out to higher values
with the presence of noise. In the general case, estimation of the average
number of photoelectrons is biased and might need special consideration.

dynamical behavior that are of major interest in photonics and laser science.
Dynamical instabilities, arising from supermode competition and slow carrier
dynamics, are known to prevent stable phase locking in a wide range of
parameter space, requiring special methods to realize stable laser operation.
Inspired by recent concepts of parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) and non-Hermitian
photonics, in this work we consider non-Hermitian coupling engineering in laser
arrays in a ring geometry and show, both analytically and numerically, that
non-Hermitian coupling can help to mitigate the onset of dynamical laser
instabilities. In particular, we consider in details two kinds of
nearest-neighbor non-Hermitian couplings: symmetric but complex mode coupling
(type-I non-Hermitian coupling) and asymmetric mode coupling (type-II
non-Hermitian coupling). Suppression of dynamical instabilities can be realized
in both coupling schemes, resulting in stable phase-locking laser emission with
the lasers emitting in phase (for type-I coupling) or with $\pi/2$ phase
gradient (for type-II coupling), resulting in a vortex far-field beam. In
type-II non-Hermitian coupling, chirality induced by asymmetric mode coupling
enables laser phase locking even in presence of moderate disorder in the
resonance frequencies of the lasers.

For this reason, a significant issue for effectively handling genomic data
through data networks consists of the available network services. A first
contribution of this paper consists of identifying the still unexploited
features of genomic data that could allow optimizing their networked
management. The second and main contribution of this survey consists of a
methodological classification of computing and networking alternatives which
can be used to offer what we call the Genomic-as-a-Service (GaaS) paradigm. In
more detail, we analyze the main genomic processing applications, and classify
not only the main computing alternatives to run genomics workflows in either a
local machine or a distributed cloud environment, but also the main software
technologies available to develop genomic processing services. Since an
analysis encompassing only the computing aspects would provide only a partial
view of the issues for deploying GaaS system, we present also the main
networking technologies that are available to efficiently support a GaaS
solution. We first focus on existing service platforms, and analyze them in
terms of service features, such as scalability, flexibility, and efficiency.
Then, we present a taxonomy for both wide area and datacenter network
technologies that may fit the GaaS requirements. It emerges that
virtualization, both in computing and networking, is the key for a successful
large-scale exploitation of genomic data, by pushing ahead the adoption of the
GaaS paradigm. Finally, the paper illustrates a short and long-term vision on

analysis. With limited memory, small devices cannot store all the samples in
the high-dimensional regime. Streaming principal component analysis aims to
find the $k$-dimensional subspace which can explain the most variation of the
$d$-dimensional data points that come into memory sequentially. In order to
deal with large $d$ and large $N$ (number of samples), most streaming PCA
algorithms update the current model using only the incoming sample and then
dump the information right away to save memory. However the information
contained in previously streamed data could be useful. Motivated by this idea,
we develop a new streaming PCA algorithm called History PCA that achieves this
goal. By using $O(Bd)$ memory with $B\approx 10$ being the block size, our
algorithm converges much faster than existing streaming PCA algorithms. By
changing the number of inner iterations, the memory usage can be further
reduced to $O(d)$ while maintaining a comparable convergence speed. We provide
theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm along with the rate
of convergence. We also demonstrate on synthetic and real world data sets that
our algorithm compares favorably with other state-of-the-art streaming PCA

experimental observations which report increased oil recovery when polymers are
injected after the initial waterflood. The recovery mechanism is believed to be
microscopic diversion of the flow, where injected particles can accumulate in
narrow pore throats and clog it, in a process known as a log-jamming effect.
The blockage of the narrow pore channels lead to a microscopic diversion of the
water flow, causing a redistribution of the local pressure, which again can
lead to the mobilization of trapped oil, enhancing its recovery. Our objective
herein is to develop a core-scale model that is consistent with the observed
production profiles. We show that previously obtained experimental results can
be qualitatively explained by a simple two-phase flow model with an additional

is that the microscopic heterogeneity of the rock and a dynamic altering of the

procedure, adopted to enhance the lateral THz image resolution beyond the
diffraction limit. Experimental data acquired with a FMCW system operating at
577 GHz with a bandwidth of 126 GHz shows that the proposed method enhances the
lateral resolution by a factor of 2.29 to 346.2um with respect to the
diffraction limit. The depth accuracy is 91um. Interestingly, the lateral
resolution enhancement achieved with this blind deconvolution concept leads to
better results in comparison to conventional gaussian deconvolution.
Experimental data on a PCB resolution target is presented, in order to quantify
the resolution enhancement and to compare the performance with established
image enhancement approaches. The presented technique allows exposure of the
interwoven fibre reinforced embedded structures of the PCB test sample.

analyzing the papers containing terms related to games for health and point
systems was performed and a mini taxonomy was derived. The search string game*
AND health AND (point* OR score) AND system* in a Scopus bibliographic database
was used to produce the corpus. We limited the search to articles, reviews and
conference papers written in English and to topics related to medical, health
and social subjects. The corpus papers abstracts and titles were analysed by
VOSviewer and a scientific landscape was generated. The search resulted in a
corpus consisting of 354 papers. The derived taxonomy contains three objects;
video games, serious games and educational games. The biblimetric mapping and
taxonomy revealed some interesting conclusions: (1) the video games have mostly
negative effects on health, (2) the serious games might have both a direct
positive health effects on users and also indirect effects by improved
competencies of health professionals, and (3) the research is concerned not
only to computer based educational games, but also to traditional table games
and sporting games. Based on the derived taxonomy we can conclude that point

Hadron Collider (LHC). It offers a probe in searches for New Physics and to
measure parameters of the Standard Model. Spin of tau lepton is an interesting
phenomenological quantity for separation of signal from background or in
measuring properties of particles. A proper treatment of tau spin effects in
the Monte Carlo simulations is important for understanding the detector
acceptance as well as for the measurements/use of tau polarization and tau spin
correlations. The TauSpinner is a tool to modify tau$spin effects in any
sample. Also production matrix elements can be modified with its help. The
general principle of TauSpinner algorithm rely on the kinematic of outgoing
particles (or jets) only, and to average over all possible initial states
accordingly to assumed parton distributions and cross-sections. Incoming on
mass-shell parton four-momenta are reconstructed in approximation, but
energy-momentum conservation is obeyed. Samples of events featuring tau leptons
with their decay products, can be used as an input. The information on the
polarization and spin correlations, and production/decay matrix elements is
reconstructed from the kinematics of the tau lepton(s) (also nu_tau in case of
W-mediated processes) and tau decay products (also jets). No other information
is required. By calculating spin (or production/decay matrix element) weights,
attributed to each event, it enables evaluation of modifications without
regenerating events.

and heaps, two fundamental, extensively studied, and practically relevant
families of data structures. Roughly speaking, we map an arbitrary heap
algorithm within a natural model, to a corresponding BST algorithm with the
same cost on a dual sequence of operations (i.e. the same sequence with the
roles of time and key-space switched). This is the first general transformation
between the two families of data structures.
  There is a rich theory of dynamic optimality for BSTs (i.e. the theory of
competitiveness between BST algorithms). The lack of an analogous theory for
heaps has been noted in the literature. Through our connection, we transfer all
instance-specific lower bounds known for BSTs to a general model of heaps,
initiating a theory of dynamic optimality for heaps.
  On the algorithmic side, we obtain a new, simple and efficient heap
algorithm, which we call the smooth heap. We show the smooth heap to be the
heap-counterpart of Greedy, the BST algorithm with the strongest proven and
conjectured properties from the literature, widely believed to be
instance-optimal. Assuming the optimality of Greedy, the smooth heap is also
optimal within our model of heap algorithms. As corollaries of results known
for Greedy, we obtain instance-specific upper bounds for the smooth heap, with
applications in adaptive sorting.
  Intriguingly, the smooth heap, although derived from a non-practical BST
algorithm, is simple and easy to implement (e.g. it stores no auxiliary data
besides the keys and tree pointers). It can be seen as a variation on the
popular pairing heap data structure, extending it with a ""power-of-two-choices""

understand the behavior of quantum Markov chains arises from the fact that
quantum mechanical operators do not commute in general. As a result we start by
explaining two techniques of how to deal with non-commuting matrices: the
spectral pinching method and complex interpolation theory. Once the reader is
familiar with these techniques a novel inequality is presented that extends the
celebrated Golden-Thompson inequality to arbitrarily many matrices. This
inequality is the key ingredient in understanding approximate quantum Markov

quantum walks. We shown that it is possible to infer about the nature of
localization in position space by monitoring the information backflow in the
reduced system. Further, we study other useful properties of quantum walk such
as entanglement, interference and its connection to quantum non-Markovianity.

  Network",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Evolutionary search has been extensively used to generate artistic images.
Raw images have high dimensionality which makes a direct search for an image
challenging. In previous work this problem has been addressed by using compact
symbolic encodings or by constraining images with priors. Recent developments
in deep learning have enabled a generation of compelling artistic images using
generative networks that encode images with lower-dimensional latent spaces. To
date this work has focused on the generation of images concordant with one or
more classes and transfer of artistic styles. There is currently no work which
uses search in this latent space to generate images scoring high or low
aesthetic measures. In this paper we use evolutionary methods to search for
images in two datasets, faces and butterflies, and demonstrate the effect of
optimising aesthetic feature scores in one or two dimensions. The work gives a
preliminary indication of which feature measures promote the most interesting
images and how some of these measures interact.

theoretically and experimentally characterise the dynamic properties of
Bose-Einstein condensates in ring-shaped potentials that are formed by scanning
an optical dipole beam in a circular trajectory. We find that unidirectional
scanning leads to a non-trivial phase profile of the condensate that can be
approximated analytically using the concept of phase imprinting. While the
phase profile is not accessible through in-trap imaging, time-of-flight
expansion manifests clear density signatures of an in-trap phase step in the
condensate, coincident with the instantaneous position of the scanning beam.
The phase step remains significant even when scanning the beam at frequencies
two orders of magnitude larger than the characteristic frequency of the trap.
We map out the phase and density properties of the condensate in the scanning
trap, both experimentally and using numerical simulations, and find excellent
agreement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bidirectional scanning eliminated
the phase gradient, rendering the system more suitable for coherent matter wave
interferometry.

H_\rho>0$ (""isotropic KPZ class"") or $\det H_\rho\le 0$ (""anisotropic KPZ
(AKPZ)"" class). The former is characterized by strictly positive growth and
roughness exponents, while in the AKPZ class fluctuations are logarithmic in
time and space. It is natural to ask (a) if one can exhibit interesting growth
models with ""smooth"" stationary states, i.e., with $O(1)$ fluctuations (instead
of logarithmically or power-like growing, as in Wolf's picture) and (b) what
new phenomena arise when $v(\cdot)$ is not smooth, so that $H_\rho$ is not
defined. The two questions are actually related and here we provide an answer
to both, in a specific framework. We define a $(2+1)$-dimensional interface
growth process, based on the so-called shuffling algorithm for domino tilings.
The stationary, non-reversible measures are translation-invariant Gibbs
measures on perfect matchings of $\mathbb Z^2$, with $2$-periodic weights. If
$\rho\ne0$, fluctuations are known to grow logarithmically in space and to
behave like a two-dimensional GFF. We prove that fluctuations grow at most
logarithmically in time and that $\det H_\rho<0$: the model belongs to the AKPZ
class. When $\rho=0$, instead, the stationary state is ""smooth"", with
correlations uniformly bounded in space and time; correspondingly, $v(\cdot)$
is not differentiable at $\rho=0$ and we extract the singularity of the
eigenvalues of $H_\rho$ for $\rho\sim 0$.

for the {\lambda}{\mu}-calculus based on non-idempotent intersection and union
types. The non-idempotent approach provides very simple combinatorial
arguments-based on decreasing measures of type derivations-to characterize head
and strongly normalizing terms. Moreover, typability provides upper bounds for
the lengths of the head reduction and the maximal reduction sequences to
normal-form. In the second part of this paper, the {\lambda}{\mu}-calculus is
refined to a small-step calculus called {\lambda}{\mu}s, which is inspired by
the substitution at a distance paradigm. The {\lambda}{\mu}s-calculus turns out
to be compatible with a natural extensionof the non-idempotent interpretations
of {\lambda}{\mu}, i.e., {\lambda}{\mu}s-reduction preserves and decreases
typing derivations in an extended appropriate typing system. We thus derive a
simple arithmetical characterization of strongly {\lambda}{\mu}s-normalizing
terms by means of typing.

probability distributions, in $[0,1]$ where 0 is maximally thin-tailed
(Gaussian) and 1 is maximally fat-tailed. Among others,1) it helps assess the
sample size needed to establish a comparative $n$ needed for statistical
significance, 2) allows practical comparisons across classes of fat-tailed
distributions, 3) helps understand some inconsistent attributes of the
lognormal, pending on the parametrization of its scale parameter. The
literature is rich for what concerns asymptotic behavior, but there is a large
void for finite values of $n$, those needed for operational purposes.
Conventional measures of fat-tailedness, namely 1) the tail index for the power
law class, and 2) Kurtosis for finite moment distributions fail to apply to
some distributions, and do not allow comparisons across classes and
parametrization, that is between power laws outside the Levy-Stable basin, or
power laws to distributions in other classes, or power laws for different
number of summands. How can one compare a sum of 100 Student T distributed
random variables with 3 degrees of freedom to one in a Levy-Stable or a
Lognormal class? How can one compare a sum of 100 Student T with 3 degrees of
freedom to a single Student T with 2 degrees of freedom? We propose an
operational and heuristic measure that allow us to compare $n$-summed
independent variables under all distributions with finite first moment. The
method is based on the rate of convergence of the Law of Large numbers for
finite sums, $n$-summands specifically. We get either explicit expressions or
simulation results and bounds for the lognormal, exponential, Pareto, and the
Student T distributions in their various calibrations --in addition to the
general Pearson classes.

is repeatedly projectively probed with a fixed period $\tau$ at position $x_d$.
We ask for the probability that the system is detected in $x_d$ for the very
first time, $F_n$, where $n$ is the number of detection attempts. We relate the
asymptotic decay and oscillations of $F_n$ with the system's energy spectrum,
which is assumed to be absolutely continuous. In particular $F_n$ is determined
by the Hamiltonian's measurement spectral density of states (MSDOS) $f(E)$ that
is closely related to the density of energy states (DOS). We find that $F_n$
decays like a power law whose exponent is determined by the power law exponent
$d_S$ of $f(E)$ around its singularities $E^*$. Our findings are analogous to
the classical first passage theory of random walks. In contrast to the
classical case, the decay of $F_n$ is accompanied by oscillations with
frequencies that are determined by the singularities $E^*$. This gives rise to
critical detection periods $\tau_c$ at which the oscillations disappear. In the
ordinary case $d_S$ can be identified with the spectral dimension found in the
DOS. Furthermore, the singularities $E^*$ are the van Hove singularities of the
DOS in this case. We find that the asymptotic statistics of $F_n$ depend
crucially on the initial and detection state and can be wildly different for
out-of-the-ordinary states, which is in sharp contrast to the classical theory.
The properties of the first detection probabilities can alternatively be
derived from the transition amplitudes. All our results are confirmed by
numerical simulations of the tight-binding model, and of a free particle in
continuous space both with a normal and with an anomalous dispersion relation.
We provide explicit asymptotic formulae for the first detection probability in
these models.

scale associated with the model are driven by the dressed $u$ and $d$ quark
mass ratio, which because of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is much closer
to unity than the associated current quark mass ratio. The pion and kaon are
given as bound states of a dressed quark and a dressed antiquark governed by
the Bethe-Salpeter equation, and exhibit the properties of Goldstone bosons,
with a pion mass difference given by $m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\pi^0}^2 \propto (m_u -
m_d)^2$ as demanded by dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. We find significant
CSB effects for realistic current quark mass ratios ($m_u/m_d \sim 0.5$) in the
quark flavor-sector electromagnetic form factors of both the pion and kaon. For
example, the difference between the $u$ and $d$ quark contributions to the
$\pi^+$ electromagnetic form factors is about 8\% at a momentum transfer of
$Q^2 \simeq 10\,$GeV$^2$, while the analogous effect for the light quark sector
form factors in the $K^+$ and $K^0$ is about twice as large. For the Parton

their unusually hard and intense X-ray emission. This emission could either
trace accretion by a compact companion or magnetic interaction between the star
and its decretion disk. To test these scenarios, we carried out a detailed
optical monitoring of HD45314, the hottest member of the class of gamma Cas
stars, along with dedicated X-ray observations on specific dates.
High-resolution optical spectra were taken to monitor the emission lines formed
in the disk, while X-ray spectroscopy was obtained at epochs when the optical
spectrum of the Oe star was displaying peculiar properties. Over the last four
years, HD45314 has entered a phase of spectacular variations. The optical
emission lines have undergone important morphology and intensity changes
including transitions between single- and multiple-peaked emission lines as
well as shell events, and phases of (partial) disk dissipation. Photometric
variations are found to be anti-correlated with the equivalent width of the
H-alpha emission. Whilst the star preserved its hard and bright X-ray emission
during the shell phase, the X-ray spectrum during the phase of (partial) disk
dissipation was significantly softer and weaker. The observed behaviour of
HD45314 suggests a direct association between the level of X-ray emission and
the amount of material simultaneously present in the Oe disk as expected in the
magnetic star-disk interaction scenario.

from monocular video. Unsupervised learning removes the need for separate
supervisory signals (depth or ego-motion ground truth, or multi-view video).
Prior work in unsupervised depth learning uses pixel-wise or gradient-based
losses, which only consider pixels in small local neighborhoods. Our main
contribution is to explicitly consider the inferred 3D geometry of the scene,
enforcing consistency of the estimated 3D point clouds and ego-motion across
consecutive frames. This is a challenging task and is solved by a novel
(approximate) backpropagation algorithm for aligning 3D structures.
  We combine this novel 3D-based loss with 2D losses based on photometric
quality of frame reconstructions using estimated depth and ego-motion from
adjacent frames. We also incorporate validity masks to avoid penalizing areas
in which no useful information exists.
  We test our algorithm on the KITTI dataset and on a video dataset captured on
an uncalibrated mobile phone camera. Our proposed approach consistently
improves depth estimates on both datasets, and outperforms the state-of-the-art
for both depth and ego-motion. Because we only require a simple video, learning
depth and ego-motion on large and varied datasets becomes possible. We
demonstrate this by training on the low quality uncalibrated video dataset and
evaluating on KITTI, ranking among top performing prior methods which are
trained on KITTI itself.

quantum field confined between two parallel plates in a D-dimensional cosmic
string spacetime. The plates are placed orthogonal to the string and the field
obeys the Robin boundary conditions on them. The boundary-induced contributions
are explicitly extracted in the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the field
squared and energy-momentum tensor for both single and two plates. The VEV of
the energy-momentum tensor, in additional to the diagonal components, contains
an off-diagonal component corresponding to the shear stress. The latter
vanishes on the plates in special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
conditions. For points outside the string core the topological contributions in
the VEVs are finite on the plates. Near the string the VEVs are dominated by
the boundary-free part, whereas at large distances the boundary-induced
contributions dominate. Due to the nonzero off-diagonal component of the vacuum
energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the normal component, the Casimir forces
have nonzero component parallel to the boundary. Unlike the problem on the
Minkowski bulk, the normal forces acting on the separate plates, in general, do
not coincide. Another difference is that in the presence of the cosmic string
the Casimir forces for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions differ. For
Dirichlet case the normal Casimir force does not depend on the curvature
coupling parameter. This is not the case for other boundary conditions. A new
qualitative feature induced by the cosmic string is the appearance of the shear
stress acting on the plates. The corresponding force is directed along the
radial coordinate and vanishes for Dirichlet and Neumann cases. Depending on
the parameters of the problem, the radial component of the shear force can be
either positive or negative.

several fundamental baryonic processes, including gas infall, re-accretion of
outflowing gas, and radial migration of disk stars. Each of these baryonic
processes in the disk evolution is characterized by model parameters, which are
determined by fitting to various observational data of the stellar disk in the
MW, including the radial dependence of the metallicity distribution function
(MDF) of the disk stars, which has recently been derived in the APOGEE survey.
We succeeded to obtain the best set of model parameters, which well reproduces
the observed radial dependences of the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and
kurtosis of the MDFs for the disk stars. We analyze the basic properties of our
model results in detail to get new insights into the important baryonic
processes in the formation history of the MW. One of the remarkable findings is
that outflowing gas, containing much heavy elements, preferentially re-accretes
onto the outer disk parts, and this recycling process of metal-enriched gas is
a key ingredient to reproduce the observed narrower MDFs at larger radii.
Moreover, important implications for the radial dependence of gas infall and
the influence of radial migration on the MDFs are also inferred from our model
calculation. Thus, the MDF of disk stars is a useful clue for studying the
formation history of the MW.

need to be able to intelligently select among a magnitude of different data
graphs based on the effects different graph operators have on them. Exhaustive
execution of an operator over the bulk of available data sources is impractical
due to the massive resources it requires. Additionally, the same process would
have to be re-implemented whenever a different operator is considered. To
address this challenge, this work proposes an efficient graph operator modeling
methodology. Our novel approach focuses on the inputs themselves, utilizing
graph similarity to infer knowledge about input graphs. The modeled operator is
only executed for a small subset of the available graphs and its behavior is
approximated for the rest of the graphs using machine learning techniques. Our
method is operator-agnostic, as the same similarity information can be reused
for modeling multiple graph operators. We also propose a family of similarity
measures based on the degree distribution that prove capable of producing high
quality estimations, comparable or even surpassing other much more costly,
state-of-the-art similarity measures. Our evaluation over both real-world and

However, these models frequently fail to take into account population
heterogeneity, which, while critically important to understanding and

is made in analysis of many mathematical models of ecological systems. Attempts
to include population heterogeneity frequently result in expanding system

Using the different properties of the induced ionization plasma, an energy
threshold of several PeV was derived for the over-dense scattering of a radio
wave off the plasma. Next to this energy threshold the radar return power was
determined for the different constituents of the plasma. It followed that the
return signal should be detectable at a distance of several hundreds of meters
to a few kilometers, depending on the plasma constituents and considered
geometry. In this article we describe a more detailed modeling of the

as well as the reflection off the under-dense plasma region. We include
skin-effects, as well as the angular dependence of the scattered signal. As a
first application of this more detailed modeling approach, we provide the

scalar fields can couple to matter with gravitational strength or greater, yet
evade the stringent constraints from classical tests of gravity on Earth and in
the Solar System. In this work, we investigate how a precision measurement of
the electron magnetic moment places meaningful constraints on both chameleons
and symmetrons. Two effects are identified: First, virtual chameleons and
symmetrons run in loops to generate quantum corrections to the intrinsic value
of the magnetic moment; a common process widely considered in the literature
for many scenarios beyond the Standard Model. A second effect, however, is
unique to scalar fields that exhibit screening. A scalar bubblelike profile
forms inside the experimental vacuum chamber and exerts a fifth force on the
electron, leading to a systematic shift in the experimental measurement. In
quantifying this latter effect, we present a novel approach that combines
analytic arguments and a small number of numerical simulations to solve for the
bubblelike profile quickly for a large range of model parameters. Taken
together, both effects yield interesting constraints in complementary regions
of parameter space. While the constraints we obtain for the chameleon are
largely uncompetitive with those in the existing literature, this still
represents the tightest constraint achievable yet from an experiment not
originally designed to search for fifth forces. We break more ground with the
symmetron, for which our results exclude a large and previously unexplored
region of parameter space. Central to this achievement are the quantum
correction terms, which are able to constrain symmetrons with masses in the
range $\mu \in [10^{-3.88},10^8]\,\text{eV}$, whereas other experiments have
hitherto only been sensitive to 1 or 2 orders of magnitude at a time.

  LCR is the question whether a designated leader thread can reach an unsafe

pressure climbs above 1 Mbar, matter is strongly coupled and quantum
degenerate. This combination invalidates most theories capable of predicting
the equation of state, the viscosity or heat conductivity of the material. When
such properties are missing, understanding planetary evolution becomes an
arduous endeavor. Henceforth, research in this field is actively growing, using
high power laser or heavy ion beams to produce samples dense enough to overcome
the 1 Mbar limit. These samples are not actively confined and tend to expand
rapidly, precluding the existence of any thermodynamically stable equilibrium.
However, a mega-ampere-class pulsed-power generator can produce confined matter
in the Mbar range, providing two conditions are being met. First, the sample
needs to be compressed cylindrically, to maximize magnetic pressure (compared
to slab compression). Second, a damper must be used to preclude the formation
of a corona around the sample. This corona robs the main sample from valuable
current and limits the homogeneity of the compression. According to numerical
simulations, the setup proposed here, and called a magnetic anvil cell, can
reach pressure on the order of 1 Mbar using a mega-ampere pulsed power driver.
These samples span several millimeters in length. Unlike diamond anvil cell,
which pressure is limited below 1 Mbar due to materials strength, the magnetic
anvil cell has virtually no pressure limit. Further, the current heats the

capabilities.

system ends up in an excited state. For quenches governed by a Hamiltonian that
preserves the symmetries present in the BHZ model (time-reversal, inversion,
and conservation of spin projection), the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant remains
equal to the one evaluated in the initial state. The bulk spin Hall
conductivity does change and its time average approaches that of the ground

distributed setting with as few colors as possible. According to the celebrated
Four Color Theorem, planar graphs can be colored with at most 4 colors, and the
proof gives a (sequential) quadratic algorithm finding such a coloring. A
natural problem is to improve this complexity in the distributed setting. Using
the fact that planar graphs contain linearly many vertices of degree at most 6,
Goldberg, Plotkin, and Shannon obtained a deterministic distributed algorithm
coloring $n$-vertex planar graphs with 7 colors in $O(\log n)$ rounds. Here, we
show how to color planar graphs with 6 colors in $\mbox{polylog}(n)$ rounds.
Our algorithm indeed works more generally in the list-coloring setting and for
sparse graphs (for such graphs we improve by at least one the number of colors
resulting from an efficient algorithm of Barenboim and Elkin, at the expense of
a slightly worst complexity). Our bounds on the number of colors turn out to be
quite sharp in general. Among other results, we show that no distributed

processing and computer vision applications. Learning kernels has mostly relied
on so-called patch-domain approaches that extract and store many overlapping
patches across training signals. Due to memory demands, patch-domain methods
have limitations when learning kernels from large datasets -- particularly with
multi-layered structures, e.g., convolutional neural networks -- or when
applying the learned kernels to high-dimensional signal recovery problems. The
so-called convolution approach does not store many overlapping patches, and
thus overcomes the memory problems particularly with careful algorithmic
designs; it has been studied within the ""synthesis"" signal model, e.g.,
convolutional dictionary learning. This paper proposes a new convolutional
analysis operator learning (CAOL) framework that learns an analysis sparsifying
regularizer with the convolution perspective, and develops a new convergent
Block Proximal Extrapolated Gradient method using a Majorizer (BPEG-M) to solve
the corresponding block multi-nonconvex problems. To learn diverse filters
within the CAOL framework, this paper introduces an orthogonality constraint
that enforces a tight-frame filter condition, and a regularizer that promotes
diversity between filters. Numerical experiments show that, with sharp
majorizers, BPEG-M significantly accelerates the CAOL convergence rate compared
to the state-of-the-art block proximal gradient (BPG) method. Numerical
experiments for sparse-view computational tomography show that a convolutional
sparsifying regularizer learned via CAOL significantly improves reconstruction
quality compared to a conventional edge-preserving regularizer. Using more and
wider kernels in a learned regularizer better preserves edges in reconstructed
images.

among which automatic lane keeping. The latter allows the car to properly
position itself within the road lanes, which is also crucial for any subsequent
lane departure or trajectory planning decision in fully autonomous cars.
Traditional lane detection methods rely on a combination of highly-specialized,
hand-crafted features and heuristics, usually followed by post-processing
techniques, that are computationally expensive and prone to scalability due to
road scene variations. More recent approaches leverage deep learning models,
trained for pixel-wise lane segmentation, even when no markings are present in
the image due to their big receptive field. Despite their advantages, these
methods are limited to detecting a pre-defined, fixed number of lanes, e.g.
ego-lanes, and can not cope with lane changes. In this paper, we go beyond the
aforementioned limitations and propose to cast the lane detection problem as an
instance segmentation problem - in which each lane forms its own instance -
that can be trained end-to-end. To parametrize the segmented lane instances
before fitting the lane, we further propose to apply a learned perspective
transformation, conditioned on the image, in contrast to a fixed ""bird's-eye
view"" transformation. By doing so, we ensure a lane fitting which is robust
against road plane changes, unlike existing approaches that rely on a fixed,
pre-defined transformation. In summary, we propose a fast lane detection
algorithm, running at 50 fps, which can handle a variable number of lanes and
cope with lane changes. We verify our method on the tuSimple dataset and
achieve competitive results.

that have been activated during prior experiences. These have been interpreted
as a memory consolidation process, but recent results suggest a possible
interpretation in terms of reinforcement learning. The Dyna reinforcement
learning algorithms use off-line replays to improve learning. Under limited
replay budget, a prioritized sweeping approach, which requires a model of the
transitions to the predecessors, can be used to improve performance. We
investigate whether such algorithms can explain the experimentally observed
replays. We propose a neural network version of prioritized sweeping
Q-learning, for which we developed a growing multiple expert algorithm, able to
cope with multiple predecessors. The resulting architecture is able to improve
the learning of simulated agents confronted to a navigation task. We predict
that, in animals, learning the world model should occur during rest periods,
and that the corresponding replays should be shuffled.

$z=6.31$ QSO SDSS J1030+0524. This is the deepest X-ray observation to date of
a $z\sim6$ QSO. The QSO is detected with a total of 125 net counts in the full
($0.5-7$ keV) band and its spectrum can be modeled by a single power-law model
with photon index of $\Gamma = 1.81 \pm 0.18$ and full band flux of
$f=3.95\times 10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. When compared with the data
obtained by XMM-Newton in 2003, our Chandra observation in 2017 shows a harder
($\Delta \Gamma \approx -0.6$) spectrum and a 2.5 times fainter flux. Such a
variation, in a timespan of $\sim2$ yrs rest-frame, is unexpected for such a
luminous QSO powered by a $> 10^9 \: M_{\odot}$ black hole. The observed source
hardening and weakening could be related to an intrinsic variation in the
accretion rate. However, the limited photon statistics does not allow us to
discriminate between an intrinsic luminosity and spectral change, and an
absorption event produced by an intervening gas cloud along the line of sight.
We also report the discovery of diffuse X-ray emission that extends for 30""x20""
southward the QSO with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$6, hardness ratio of
$HR=0.03_{-0.25}^{+0.20}$, and soft band flux of $f_{0.5-2 \: keV}=
1.1_{-0.3}^{+0.3} \times 10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, that is not
associated to a group or cluster of galaxies. We discuss two possible
explanations for the extended emission, which may be either associated with the
radio lobe of a nearby, foreground radio galaxy (at $z \approx 1-2$), or
ascribed to the feedback from the QSO itself acting on its surrounding
environment, as proposed by simulations of early black hole formation.

charge (namely magnetic monopoles) does not exist in the elementary
electromagnetism. Consequently, magnetic flux lines only form loops and cannot
have a source or a sink in nature. It is thus extraordinary to find that
magnetic monopoles can be pictured conceptually in topological materials.
Specifically in the 2D topological insulators, the topological invariant
corresponds to the total flux of an effective magnetic field (the Berry
curvature) over the reciprocal space.It is thus tempting to wrap the 2D
reciprocal space into a compact manifold--a torus, and imagine the total flux
to originate from magnetic monopoles inside the torus with a quantized total
charge. However, such a physically appealing picture has not been realized
quantitatively: other than their existence in a toy (actually misleading)
picture, the properties of the magnetic monopoles remain unknown. Here, we will
address this long-standing problem by hunting down the magnetic monopoles in
the reciprocal $k$-space. We will show that a simple and physically useful
picture will arrive upon analytically continuing the system to a third
imaginary momentum space. We then illustrate the evolution of the magnetic
monopoles across the topological phase transition and use it to provide natural
explanations on: 1) discontinuous jump of integer topological invariants, 2)
the semi-metallic nature on the phase boundary, and 3) how a change of global
topology can be induced via a local change in reciprocal space.

one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model near its quantum critical point
(QCP). Our study has been motivated by the question about the thermodynamical
signatures of this paradigmatic quantum critical system and, more generally, by
the issue of how quantum criticality accumulates entropy. We find that the
crossovers in the phase diagram of temperature and (the non-thermal control
parameter) transverse field obey a general scaling ansatz, and so does the
critical scaling behavior of the specific heat and magnetic expansion
coefficient. Furthermore, the Gr\""{u}neisen ratio diverges in a power-law way
when the QCP is accessed as a function of the transverse field at zero
temperature, which follows the prediction of quantum critical scaling. However,
at the critical field, upon decreasing the temperature, the Gr\""uneisen ratio
approaches a constant instead of showing the expected divergence. We are able
to understand this unusual result in terms of a peculiar form of the quantum
critical scaling function for the free energy; the contribution to the
Gr\""uneisen ratio vanishes at the linear order in a suitable Taylor expansion
of the scaling function. In spite of this special form of the scaling function,
we show that the entropy is still maximized near the QCP, as expected from the
general scaling argument. Our results establish the telltale thermodynamic
signature of a transverse-field Ising chain, and will thus facilitate the
experimental identification of this model quantum-critical system in real

coarse grid simulations relative to the fine grid ones in homogeneous (teamed

large-scale jets) flows, and analyse how the spread of stochastic solutions
depends on different parameters of the model. The parameterisation is tested by
comparing it with the true eddy-resolving solution that has reached some
statistical equilibrium and the deterministic solution modelled on a
low-resolution grid. The results show that the proposed parameterisation
significantly depends on the resolution of the stochastic model and gives good
ensemble performance for both homogeneous and heterogeneous flows, and the

at a first order vacuum phase transition. We find a power law for the
gravitational wave power spectrum at high wavenumber which falls off as
$k^{-1.5}$ rather than the $k^{-1}$ produced by the envelope approximation. The
peak of the power spectrum is shifted to slightly lower wave numbers from that
of the envelope approximation. The envelope approximation reproduces our
results for the peak power less well, agreeing only to within an order of
magnitude. After the bubbles finish colliding the scalar field oscillates
around the true vacuum. An additional feature is produced in the UV of the
gravitational wave power spectrum, and this continues to grow linearly until
the end of our simulation. The additional feature peaks at a length scale close
to the bubble wall thickness and is shown to have a negligible contribution to
the energy in gravitational waves, providing the scalar field mass is much
smaller than the Planck mass.

candidate feature to meet the explosive growth of traffic demand since 3GPP

context the operation of both uplink and downlink has been supported and
studied in the subsequent releases. However, it has been identified that
scheduled uplink transmission performance in unlicensed spectrum is
significantly degraded due to the double listen-before-talk (LBT) requirements
at both eNB when sending the uplink grant, and at the scheduled UEs before
transmission. In this paper, in order to overcome this issue, a novel uplink
transmission scheme, which does not require any grant, is proposed, and the
details regarding the system design are provided. By modeling the dynamics in
time of the LBT for both a system that employs a conventional uplink scheme, as
well as the proposed scheme, it is verified through analytical evaluation that
the double LBT scheme for uplink transmission greatly reduces the channel
access probability for the UE, and leads consequently to performance loss,
while the proposed scheme is able to alleviate this issue. System level
simulation results, compliant with the LTE standard, show that the proposed
scheme can achieve a significant performance gain in terms of throughput with
negligible performance loss for the downlink, and other technologies operating
in the same spectrum.

For a better trade-off between bit-error-rate (BER) performance and
computational complexity, iterative linear algorithms like conjugate gradient
(CG) have been applied and have shown their feasibility in recent years. In
this paper, residual-based detection (RBD) algorithms are proposed for M-MIMO

algorithms focus on the minimization of residual norm per iteration, whereas
most existing algorithms focus on the approximation of exact signal. Numerical
results have shown that, for $64$-QAM $128\times 8$ MIMO, RBD algorithms are
only $0.13$ dB away from the exact matrix inversion method when BER$=10^{-4}$.
Stability of RBD algorithms has also been verified in various correlation
conditions. Complexity comparison has shown that, CR algorithm require $87\%$
less complexity than the traditional method for $128\times 60$ MIMO. The
unified hardware architecture is proposed with flexibility, which guarantees a
