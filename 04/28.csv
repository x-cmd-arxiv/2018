neural networks. It requires propagating error gradients sequentially from the
output layer all the way back to the input layer. The backward locking in
backpropagation algorithm constrains us from updating network layers in
parallel and fully leveraging the computing resources. Recently, several
algorithms have been proposed for breaking the backward locking. However, their
performances degrade seriously when networks are deep. In this paper, we
propose decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm for deep learning
optimization with convergence guarantee. Firstly, we decouple the
backpropagation algorithm using delayed gradients, and show that the backward
locking is removed when we split the networks into multiple modules. Then, we
utilize decoupled parallel backpropagation in two stochastic methods and prove
that our method guarantees convergence to critical points for the non-convex
problem. Finally, we perform experiments for training deep convolutional neural
networks on benchmark datasets. The experimental results not only confirm our
theoretical analysis, but also demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve
significant speedup without loss of accuracy.

point inside the sphere a free energy calculated on a thin spherical band
around it, using many orthogonal replicas. This allows us to reinterpret,
rigorously prove and extend for general spherical models the main ideas of the
Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) approach originally introduced in the 70s for
the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. In particular, we establish a TAP
representation for the free energy, valid for any overlap value which can be
sampled as many times as we wish in an appropriate sense. We call such overlaps
multi-samplable. The correction to the Hamiltonian in the TAP representation
arises in our analysis as the free energy of a certain model on an overlap
dependent band. For the largest multi-samplable overlap it coincides with the
Onsager reaction term from physics. For smaller multi-samplable overlaps the
formula we obtain is new. We also derive the corresponding TAP equation for
critical points. We prove all the above without appealing to the celebrated
Parisi formula or the ultrametricity property.
  We prove that any overlap value in the support of the Parisi measure is
multi-samplable. For generic models, we further show that the set of
multi-samplable overlaps coincides with a certain set that arises in the
characterization for the Parisi measure by Talagrand. The ultrametric tree of
pure states can be embedded in the interior of the sphere in a natural way. For
this embedding, we show that the points on the tree uniformly maximize the free
energies we define. From this we conclude that the Hamiltonian at each point on
the tree is approximately maximal over the sphere of same radius, and that
points on the tree approximately solve the TAP equations for critical points.

United States. However, convincing US courts to adopt specific measures to
quantify gerrymandering has been of limited success to date. Recently,
Stephanopoulos and McGhee introduced a new and precise measure of partisan
gerrymandering via the so-called ""efficiency gap"" that computes the absolutes
difference of wasted votes between two political parties in a two-party system.
Quite importantly from a legal point of view, this measure was found legally
convincing enough in a US appeals court in a case that claims that the
legislative map of the state of Wisconsin was gerrymandered; the case is now
pending in US Supreme Court. In this article, we show the following:
  (a) We provide interesting mathematical and computational complexity
properties of the problem of minimizing the efficiency gap measure. To the best
of our knowledge, these are the first non-trivial theoretical and algorithmic
analyses of this measure of gerrymandering.
  (b) We provide a simple and fast algorithm that can ""un-gerrymander"" the
district maps for the states of Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by
bring their efficiency gaps to acceptable levels from the current unacceptable
levels. Our work thus shows that, notwithstanding the general worst case
approximation hardness of the efficiency gap measure as shown by us,finding
district maps with acceptable levels of efficiency gaps is a computationally
tractable problem from a practical point of view. Based on these empirical
results, we also provide some interesting insights into three practical issues
related the efficiency gap measure.
  We believe that, should the US Supreme Court uphold the decision of lower
courts, our research work and software will provide a crucial supporting hand
to remove partisan gerrymandering.

discs where: (i) accretion flows arise because turbulence diffusively
transports angular momentum; (ii) laminar accretion flows are confined to thin,
ionised layers near disk surfaces and are driven by the launching of
magneto-centrifugal winds, with the midplane being completely inert; (iii)
laminar accretion flows pervade the full column density of the disc, and are
driven by a combination of large scale horizontal and vertical magnetic fields.

that the spectrum of protons inside clumps is much harder than that in the

show that a hadronic scenario including dense clumps inside the remnant shell

evidence for the smoothness of the horizon of black holes dual to typical

on current models, has not been shown to exhibit any diurnal asymmetries. Here
we simulate Europa's exosphere using a 3-D Monte Carlo routine including, for
the first time, the role of Europa's rotation on the evolution of exospheric
molecules throughout the orbit. We focus on O$_2$, sputtered by a trailing
hemisphere source with a temperature-dependence under isotropic plasma
conditions. We find that the O$_2$ component, while global, is not homogenous
in Europa local time. Rather, the O$_2$ accumulates at the dusk hemisphere.
When rotation is explicitly excluded, no diurnal asymmetries exist. We find
that the assumed thermal-dependence on the O$_2$ source is critical for a
diurnal asymmetry: the diurnal surface temperature profile is imprinted on to
the near-surface O$_2$ atmosphere, due to the small hop times of the
non-adsorbing O$_2$ effectively rotating with Europa. Altogether, our
simulations conclude that the dusk-over-dawn asymmetry is driven by Europa's
day-night O$_2$ cycle synchronized with Europa's orbital period based on our
model assumptions on O$_2$ production and loss. This conclusion is in agreement
with the recent understanding that a non-adsorbing, rotating O$_2$ source
peaking at noon will naturally accumulate from dawn-to-dusk, should the O$_2$
lifetime be sufficiently long compared to the orbital period. Lastly we compare
hemispherically-averaged dusk-over-dawn ratios to the recently observed oxygen
emission data by the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that while the simulations
are globally consistent with brighter oxygen emission at dusk than at dawn, the
orbital evolution of the asymmetries in our simulations can be improved by
ameliorating the O$_2$ source & loss rates, and possibly adsorption onto the

orbital dependence of the local source of the near-surface O$_2$ atmosphere is
due to thermal release of O$_2$ likely trapped on the ice grains at dangling
bonds with a smaller contribution due to direct sputtering. This could also
impact our understanding of the suggestion that the radiolytic products in

As an example, the O$_2$ exosphere should peak at the equator with systematic
maximum at the dusk equator terminator. The sputtering rate of the H$_2$O
exosphere should be maximum on the leading hemisphere because of the shape of
the open/close field lines boundary and displays some significant variability

and use the generating functions framework to predict theoretically the
behavior of the relevant magnitudes of the system at the steady state. We find
a perfect agreement between the solutions of the theoretical equations and the
results of stochastic simulations. In addition, we find an interesting phase
diagram in the plane $\beta-\omega$, which is composed by an epidemic and a
non-epidemic phases, separated by a critical threshold line $\beta_c$, which
depends on $q$. Wefind that, for all values of $q$, a region in the diagram
where the vaccination is so efficient that, regardless of the virulence of the
disease, it never becomes an epidemic. We compare our strategy with random
immunization and find that using the same amount of vaccines for both
scenarios, we obtain that the spread of the disease is much lower in the case
of dynamic vaccination when compared to random immunization. Furthermore, we
also compare our strategy with targeted immunization and we find that,
depending on $\omega$, dynamic vaccination will perform significantly better,

witnesses, developing a hierarchy of witnesses for classes of observables. This
hierarchy captures the fact that entangled states act as witnesses for
detecting entanglement witnesses and separable states act as witnesses for the
set of non-block-positive Hermitian operators. Indeed, more hierarchies of
witnesses exist. We introduce the concept of \emph{finer} and \emph{optimal}
entangled states. These definitions not only give an unambiguous and
non-numeric quantification of entanglement and a new perspective on edge states
but also answer the open question of what the remainder of the best separable

implies that we can focus only on the study of a typical family with optimal
entangled states at its core when we investigate entangled states. Our
framework also assembles many seemingly different findings with simple
arguments that do not require lengthy calculations.

specification of consensus, called \emph{recoverable consensus} in this paper,
is weakened by allowing non-terminating executions when a process fails
infinitely often. Two variations of this model are considered: independent
failures, and simultaneous (i.e., system-wide) failures. Several results are
proved in this model: (i) We prove that any primitive at level two of Herlihy's
hierarchy remains at level two if simultaneous crash-recovery failures are
introduced. This is accomplished by transforming (one instance of) any
2-process conventional consensus algorithm to a 2-process recoverable consensus

of any conventional $n$-process consensus algorithm and $\Theta(f + n)$
read/write registers to solve $n$-process recoverable consensus when
crash-recovery failures are independent, assuming that every execution contains
at most $f$ such failures. (iii) Next, we prove for any $f > 0$ that any

couple the system to a dynamic boundary controller, that is, a controller that

use a nonlinear controller in order to capture the nonlinear behavior that
realistic actuators often exhibit and, moreover, we allow the output of the
controller to be corrupted by actuator disturbances before it is fed back into
the system. What we show here is that the resulting nonlinear closed-loop
system is input-to-state stable w.r.t.~square-integrable disturbance inputs. In

$N=1$ and a special class of nonlinear controllers, and weak input-to-state

payoff are a standard framework to model a wide range of problems related to
decision making under uncertainty. Traditionally, the goal has been to obtain
policies that optimize the expectation of the discounted-sum payoff. A key
drawback of the expectation measure is that even low probability events with
extreme payoff can significantly affect the expectation, and thus the obtained
policies are not necessarily risk-averse. An alternate approach is to optimize
the probability that the payoff is above a certain threshold, which allows
obtaining risk-averse policies, but ignores optimization of the expectation. We
consider the expectation optimization with probabilistic guarantee (EOPG)
problem, where the goal is to optimize the expectation ensuring that the payoff
is above a given threshold with at least a specified probability. We present
several results on the EOPG problem, including the first algorithm to solve it.

technique consists of culturing cells on nano/micro pillars. The tight adhesion

the permeabilization of lipids at the plasma membrane, providing access to the
internal compartment. However, there is still much experimental controversy
regarding when and how the intracellular environment is targeted and the role
of the geometry and interactions with surfaces. Consequently, we investigated,
by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the cell membrane, the
mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer under high strain and bending
conditions. We found out that a high curvature of the lipid bilayer
dramatically lowers the traction force necessary to achieve membrane rupture.
Afterwards, we experimentally studied the permeabilization rate of cell
membrane by pillars with comparable aspect ratios but different sharpness
values at the edges. The experimental data support the simulation results: even
pillars with diameters in the micron range may cause local membrane disruption
when their edges are sufficiently sharp. Therefore, the permeabilization
likelihood is connected to the local geometric features of the pillars rather
than diameter or aspect ratio. The present study can also provide significant
contributions to the design of 3D biointerfaces for tissue engineering and
cellular growth.

used as a quantum channel to transmit quantum information between distinct
locations. Here we consider the task of estimating entanglement in
teleportation experiments. We show that the data accessible in a teleportation
experiment allows to put a lower bound on some entanglement measures, such as
entanglement negativity and robustness. Furthermore, we show cases in which the
lower bounds are tight. The introduced lower bounds can also be interpreted as
quantifiers of the nonclassicality of a teleportation experiment. Thus, our
findings provide a quantitative relation between teleportation and
entanglement.

surfaces. In particular, we discuss the presence and effects of spin
connections, which describe how spinors and vectors couple to the geometry of
curves and surfaces. We derive explicit expressions of spin connections by
performing simple dimensional reduction from the three-dimensional flat space.
The spin connections act on electrons as spin-dependent magnetic fields, which
have been known as `pseudomagnetic fields' in the context of, e.g., graphenes
and Dirac/Weyl semimetals. We propose that these spin-dependent magnetic fields
are present universally on curves and surfaces, acting on electrons regardless
of the kinds of their spinorial degrees of freedom and their dispersion
relations. We discuss that the curvature effects via spin connections will
induce the spin Hall effect and induce the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interactions
between magnetic moments on curved surfaces, without relying on the
relativistic spin-orbit couplings. We also mention the importance of spin
connections on orbital physics of electrons on curved geometry.

the black hole, and their possible role in resolutions of the information
paradox. We argue that if fuzzballs provide a description of black-hole
microstates, then the typical fuzzball geometry can only differ significantly
from the conventional black-hole geometry at a Planck-scale-distance from the
horizon. However, precisely in this region, quantum fluctuations in the
fuzzball geometry become large and the fuzzball geometry becomes unreliable. We
verify these expectations through a detailed calculation of quantum expectation
values and quantum fluctuations in the two-charge fuzzball geometries. We then
examine some of the solutions discovered in arXiv:1607.03908. We show, based on
a calculation of a probe two-point function in this background, that these
solutions, and others in their class, violate robust expectations about the gap
in energies between successive energy eigenstates, and differ too much from the
conventional black hole to represent viable microstates. We conclude that while
fuzzballs are interesting star-like solutions in string theory, they do not
appear to be relevant for resolving the information paradox, and cannot be used
to make valid inferences about black-hole interiors.

can be easily implemented. A mathematical analysis is carried out to prove that
the proposed basis functions are continuous and linearly independent. Finite
element spaces are then defined as the spanning sets of such functions, and the
implementation of a multigrid algorithm built on these spaces is discussed. A
spectral analysis of the multigrid algorithm highlights superior convergence
properties of the proposed method over existing strategies based on a local
smoothing procedure. Finally, linear and nonlinear numerical examples are
tested to show the robustness and versatility of the multigrid algorithm.

the case $\xi\leq M$ a.s.\ for some deterministic $M>0$ (weak sparsity) was

  This result is based on hands-on calculations in both categories. We analyze
coherent sheaves by constructing a tilting generator, using the characteristic

described using a simple combinatorial rule. The endomorphism algebra $H$ of
this tilting generator has a simple quadratic presentation in the grading

time series values to the analytic phase of the reference signal. The resulting
estimate of the pseudo-periodic cycle has a considerably higher effective
sampling rate than the time series. The procedure is applied to time series of
MRI images of the human brain. As a result, the effective sampling rate could
be increased by three orders of magnitude. This allows for capturing the

Hypersampling is numerically compared to the more commonly used retrospective

frequency under the SINR model. Transmission power may vary from one
transmitter to another, and a transmitter's signal strength at a given point is
modeled by the transmitter's power divided by some constant power $\alpha$ of
the distance it traveled. Roughly, a receiver at a given location can hear a
specific transmitter only if the transmitter's signal is stronger by a
specified ratio than the signals of all other transmitters combined. An SINR
query is to determine whether a receiver at a given location can hear any
transmitter, and if yes, which one.
  An approximate answer to an SINR query is such that one gets a definite YES
or definite NO, when the ratio between the strongest signal and all other
signals combined is well above or well below the reception threshold, while the
answer in the intermediate range is allowed to be either YES or NO.
  We describe compact data structures that support approximate SINR queries in
the plane in a dynamic context, i.e., where transmitters may be inserted and
deleted over time. We distinguish between two main variants --- uniform power
and non-uniform power. In both variants the preprocessing time is $O(n

$O(\mathop{\textrm{polylog}} n)$ for uniform power, and randomized time
$O(\sqrt{n} \mathop{\textrm{polylog}} n)$ with high probability for non-uniform

  Finally, we observe that in the static context the latter data structure can
be implemented differently, so that the query time is also
$O(\mathop{\textrm{polylog}} n)$, thus significantly improving all previous

than a decade ago has revolutionized modern condensed matter physics. Today,
the field of topological states of matter is one of the most active and
fruitful research areas for both experimentalists and theorists. The physics of
topological insulators is typically well described by band theory and systems
of non-interacting fermions. In contrast, several of the most fascinating
effects in condensed matter physics merely exist due to electron-electron
interactions, examples include unconventional superconductivity, the Kondo
effect, and the Mott-Hubbard transition. The aim of this review article is to
give an overview of the manifold directions which emerge when topological
bandstructures and correlation physics interfere and compete. These include the
study of the stability of topological bandstructures and correlated topological
insulators. Interaction-induced topological phases such as the topological
Kondo insulator provide another exciting topic. More exotic states of matter
such as topological Mott insulator and fractional Chern insulators only exist
due to the interplay of topology and strong interactions and do not have any
bandstructure analogue. Eventually the relation between topological
bandstructures and frustrated quantum magnetism in certain transition metal
oxides is emphasized.

tasks. The biggest challenge of text mining is high dimensional data, i.e., a
corpus of documents can contain $10^4$ to $10^6$ unique words. To address this
complexity, some very convoluted text mining methods have been applied. Is that
complexity necessary? Are there simpler ways to quickly generate models that
perform as well as the more convoluted methods and also be human-readable?
  To answer these questions, we explore a combination of LDA (Latent Dirichlet
Allocation) and FFTs (Fast and Frugal Trees) to classify NASA software bug
reports from six different projects. Designed using principles from
psychological science, FFTs return very small models that are
human-comprehensible. When compared to the commonly used text mining method and
a recent state-of-the-art-system (search-based SE method that automatically
tune the control parameters of LDA), these FFT models are very small (a binary
tree of depth $d = 4$ that references only 4 topics) and hence easy to
understand. They were also faster to generate and produced similar or better
severity predictions.
  Hence we can conclude that, at least for datasets explored here, convoluted
text mining models can be deprecated in favor of simpler method such as
LDA+FFTs. At the very least, we recommend LDA+FFTs (a) when humans need to
read, understand, and audit a model or (b) as an initial baseline method for
the SE researchers exploring text artifacts from software projects.

265.12d, b = -2.0d) at a distance of 5640 pc. Its proper motion is
mu(alfa)cos(delta) = -4.92+-0.08 mas/yr, mu(delta) = 3.26+-0.08 mas/yr. We
derived an average heliocentric radial velocity of 35 km/s and were able to
confirm the binary nature of the (ALS 1135) system and detect four new binary
star candidates. Analysis of data for massive Bo 7 star candidates points
towards a young age (< 3x10^6 years old) for the association, although the
presence of a previous episode of star formation remains to be analyzed.

found numerous applications in databases, networking, computational biology and
other domains. Many applications that use the count-min sketch process massive
and rapidly evolving datasets. For data-intensive applications that aim to keep
the overestimate error low, the count-min sketch may become too large to store
in available RAM and may have to migrate to external storage (e.g., SSD.) Due
to the random-read/write nature of hash operations of the count-min sketch,
simply placing it on SSD stifles the performance of time-critical applications,
requiring about 4-6 random reads/writes to SSD per estimate (lookup) and update
(insert) operation.
  In this paper, we expand on the preliminary idea of the Buffered Count-Min
Sketch (BCMS) [15], an SSD variant of the count-min sketch, that used hash
localization to scale efficiently out of RAM while keeping the total error
bounded. We describe the design and implementation of the buffered count-min
sketch, and empirically show that our implementation achieves 3.7x-4.7x the
speedup on update (insert) and 4.3x speedup on estimate (lookup) operations.
  Our design also offers an asymptotic improvement in the external-memory model
[1] over the original data structure: r random I/Os are reduced to 1 I/O for
the estimate operation. For a data structure that uses k blocks on SSD, was the
word/counter size, r as the number of rows, M as the number of bits in the main
memory, our data structure uses kwr/M amortized I/Os for updates, or, if kwr/M
>1, 1 I/O in the worst case. In typical scenarios, kwr/M is much smaller than
1. This is in contrast to O(r) I/Os incurred for each update in the original
data structure.

Tiramisu uses a four-level intermediate representation that allows full

(CP) transmission over frequency-selective channels. In this paper, we propose
a computationally efficient block processing equalizer based on the Expectation
Maximization (EM) algorithm in CP-free transmission for 1-bit quantized
systems. We investigate the optimal block length and overlapping factor in
relation to the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) length based on the Bit
Error-Rate (BER) performance metric. As EM is a non-linear algorithm, the
optimal estimate is found iteratively depending on the initial starting point
of the algorithm. Through numerical simulations we show that initializing the
EM-algorithm with a Wiener-Filter (WF) estimate, which takes the underlying
quantization into account, achieves superior BER-performance compared to
initialization with other starting points.

of outliers. Given a matrix $A$ ($d \times n$) and parameters $k, m$, the goal
is to remove a set of at most $m$ columns of $A$ (known as outliers), so as to
minimize the rank-$k$ approximation error of the remaining matrix. While much
of the work on this problem has focused on recovery of the rank-$k$ subspace
under assumptions on the inliers and outliers, we focus on the approximation
problem above. Our main result shows that sampling-based methods developed in
the outlier-free case give non-trivial guarantees even in the presence of
outliers. Using this insight, we develop a simple algorithm that has
bi-criteria guarantees. Further, unlike similar formulations for clustering, we
show that bi-criteria guarantees are unavoidable for the problem, under
appropriate complexity assumptions.

the LHC in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. The search
profits from the large s-channel $b$-quark annihilation production of the heavy
CP-even and CP-odd Higgs bosons (H/A) which can be attained in regions of
$\tan\beta\gg 1$ that avoid the stringent $H/A \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ searches via
decays into stau pairs. We also focus on regions where the staus branching
ratios are dominated by the decays into a tau lepton and the lightest
neutralino. Thus the experimental signature consists of final states made up of
a tau-lepton pair plus large missing transverse energy. We take advantage of
the large stau-pair production cross sections via heavy Higgs boson decays,
which are between one or two orders of magnitude larger than the usual
electroweak production cross sections for staus. A set of basic cuts allow us
to obtain significances of the signal over the SM backgrounds at the discovery
level (5 standard deviations) in the next LHC run with a center-of-mass energy
of 14 TeV and a total integrated luminosity of only 100 fb$^{-1}$.

governed by the Mott gap in the excitation spectrum. Here we summarize and

almost perfect triangular lattice, leading to strong frustration. Due to
differences in bandwidth, the effective correlation strength varies over a wide
range, leading to a rather distinct behavior as far as the electrodynamic
properties are concerned. We discuss the spinon contributions to the optical
conductivity in comparison to metallic quantum fluctuations in the vicinity of

subspace forms a Hadamard matrix. It is shown that such a matrix of order $n$
exists, if there exists a skew Hadamard matrix of this size. This is the case
for any even dimension $n\le 20$, and for these dimensions we demonstrate that
a bistochastic matrix $B$ located at any ray of the Birkhoff polytope, (which
joins the center of this body with any permutation matrix), is unistochastic.
An explicit form of the corresponding unitary matrix $U$, such that
$B_{ij}=|U_{ij}|^2$, is determined by a robust Hadamard matrix. These unitary
matrices allow us to construct a family of orthogonal bases in the composed
Hilbert space of order $n \times n$. Each basis consists of vectors with the
same degree of entanglement and the constructed family interpolates between the

quantized samples is a typical problem in instrumentation and measurement. A
standard approach for its solution makes use of a least squares estimator (LSE)
that, however, does not perform optimally in the presence of quantization
errors. In fact, if the quantization error cannot be modeled as an additive
noise source, as it often happens in practice, the LSE returns biased
estimates. In this paper, we consider the estimation of the amplitude of a
noisy sine wave after quantization. The proposed technique is based on a
uniform distribution of signal phases and it does not require that the
quantizer has equally spaced transition levels. The experimental results show
that this technique removes the estimation bias associated with the usage of
the LSE and that it is sufficiently robust with respect to small uncertainties
in the known values of transition levels.

The classical Sauer-Perles-Shelah Lemma implies that $\text{Tr}(n, n^r, k) =
2^k$ for $k \le r$. While determining $\text{Tr}(n,n^r,k)$ precisely for
general $k$ seems hopeless even for constant $r$, estimating it, and more
generally estimating the function $\text{Tr}(n,m,k)$ for all range of the
parameters, remains a widely open problem with connections to important
questions in computer science and combinatorics. Here we essentially resolve
this problem when $k$ is linear and $m=n^r$ where $r$ is constant, proving
that, for any constant $\alpha>0$, $\text{Tr}(n,n^r,\alpha n) =
\tilde\Theta(n^C)$ with

  For the proof we establish a ""sparse"" version of another classical result,
the Kruskal-Katona Theorem, which gives a stronger guarantee when the
hypergraph does not induce dense sub-hypergraphs. Furthermore, we prove that
the parameters in our sparse Kruskal-Katona theorem are essentially best
possible. Finally, we mention two simple applications which may be of

indeterminacy that is expressed purely in terms of the asymptotic behavior of
the moment sequence (and its extension to imaginary lines). Under an additional
assumption this provides a converse to the classical Carleman's criterion, thus
yielding an equivalent condition for moment determinacy. We also provide a
criterion for moment determinacy that only involves the large asymptotic
behavior of the distribution (or of the density if it exists), which can be
thought of as an Abelian counterpart to the previous Tauberian type result.
This latter criterion generalizes Hardy's condition for determinacy, and under
some further assumptions yields a converse to the Pedersen's refinement of the
celebrated Krein's theorem. The proofs utilize non-classical Tauberian results
for moment sequences that are analogues to the ones developed in Feigin and
Yashchin, and, Balkema et al. for the bi-lateral Laplace transforms in the

studying the time-dependent moment problem for the law of log-L\'evy processes

allocation strategy among the BSs and the optimal multicast beamforming
transmission strategy at the CP such that the user's requested messages are
delivered from the CP to the BSs in the most efficient way. We first state a
multicast backhaul rate expression based on a joint cache-channel coding
scheme, which implies that larger cache sizes should be allocated to the BSs
with weaker channels. We then formulate a two-timescale joint cache size
allocation and beamforming design problem, where the cache is optimized offline
based on the long-term channel statistical information, while the beamformer is
designed during the file delivery phase based on the instantaneous channel
state information. By leveraging the sample approximation method and the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we develop efficient
algorithms for optimizing cache size allocation among the BSs, and quantify how
much more cache should be allocated to the weaker BSs. We further consider the
case with multiple files having different popularities and show that it is in
general not optimal to entirely cache the most popular files first. Numerical
results show considerable performance improvement of the optimized cache size
allocation scheme over the uniform allocation and other heuristic schemes.

Specifically, in the training stage, to register the input CT and MR images,
their similarity is evaluated on the warped MR image and the MR image that is
paired with the input CT. So that, the intra-modality similarity metric can be
directly applied to measure whether the input CT and MR images are well

measure the similarity on both CT modality and MR modality. In this way, the
complementary anatomies in both modalities can be jointly considered to more

the trained inter-modality registration network can be directly applied to
register the new multimodal images without any paired data. Experimental
results have shown that, the proposed method can achieve promising accuracy and

Linear Regression (CLR). CLR aims to find the partition of the data into $k$

overall mean squared error on the whole data. The main obstacle preventing to
use found regression models for prediction on the unseen test points is the
absence of a reasonable way to obtain CLR cluster labels when the values of

how to solve this problem. The first approach, predictive CLR builds a separate
classification model to predict test CLR labels. The second approach,
constrained CLR utilizes a set of user-specified constraints that enforce
certain points to go to the same clusters. Assuming the constraint values are
known for the test points, they can be directly used to assign CLR labels. We
evaluate these two approaches on three UCI ML datasets as well as on a large

significantly improve over the known CLR-based regression methods. Moreover,
predictive CLR consistently outperforms linear regression and random forest,
and shows comparable performance to support vector regression on UCI ML

using techniques like domain adversarial training. In contrast, CROSSGRAD is
free to use domain signals for predicting labels, if it can prevent overfitting

a sampling step is implemented as data augmentation, based on domain-guided
perturbations of input instances. CROSSGRAD parallelly trains a label and a
domain classifier on examples perturbed by loss gradients of each other's
objectives. This enables us to directly perturb inputs, without separating and
re-mixing domain signals while making various distributional assumptions.
Empirical evaluation on three different applications where this setting is
natural establishes that (1) domain-guided perturbation provides consistently
better generalization to unseen domains, compared to generic instance
perturbation methods, and that (2) data augmentation is a more stable and

of the interstellar medium. In their interiors, the main component (A>90) of
the slow neutron capture process (the s-process) is synthesized, the most
important neutron source being the 13C(alpha,n)16O reaction. In this paper we
review its current experimental status discussing possible future synergies
between some experiments currently focused on the determination of its rate.
Moreover, in order to determine the level of precision needed to fully
characterize this reaction, we present a theoretical sensitivity study, carried
out with the FUNS evolutionary stellar code and the NEWTON post-process code.
We modify the rate up to a factor of two with respect to a reference case. We
find that variations of the 13C(alpha,n)16O rate do not appreciably affect
s-process distributions for masses above 3 Msun at any metallicity. Apart from
a few isotopes, in fact, the differences are always below 5%. The situation is
completely different if some 13C burns in a convective environment: this occurs
in FUNS models with M<3 Msun at solar-like metallicities. In this case, a
change of the 13C(alpha,n)16O reaction rate leads to non-negligible variations
of the elements Surface distribution (10% on average), with larger peaks for
some elements (as rubidium) and for neutron-rich isotopes (as 86Kr and 96Zr).
Larger variations are found in low-mass low-metallicity models, if protons are
mixed and burnt at very high temperatures. In this case, the surface abundances
of the heavier elements may vary by more than a factor 50.

cosmological context they often overclose the universe (contrary to
observational evidence), although one may prevent this by introducing biases or
forcing anisotropic evolution of the walls. In a previous work [Correia {\it et
al.}, Phys.Rev.D90, 023521 (2014)] we numerically studied the evolution of
various types of biased domain wall networks in the early universe, confirming
that anisotropic networks ultimately reach scaling while those with a biased
potential or biased initial conditions decay. We also found that the analytic
decay law obtained by Hindmarsh was in good agreement with simulations of
biased potentials, but not of biased initial conditions, and suggested that the
difference was related to the Gaussian approximation underlying the analytic
law. Here we extend our previous work in several ways. For the cases of biased
potential and biased initial conditions we study in detail the field
distributions in the simulations, confirming that the validity (or not) of the
Gaussian approximation is the key difference between the two cases. For
anisotropic walls we carry out a more extensive set of numerical simulations
and compare them to the canonical velocity-dependent one-scale model for domain
walls, finding that the model accurately predicts the linear scaling regime
after isotropization. Overall, our analysis provides a quantitative description
of the cosmological evolution of these networks.

known, a nontrivial behavior of conductivity in metals in strong magnetic
fields is connected usually with appearance of non-closed quasiclassical
electron trajectories on the Fermi surface in a magnetic field. The structure
of the electron trajectories depends strongly on the direction of the magnetic
field and usually the greatest interest is caused by open trajectories that are
stable to small rotations of the direction of $\, {\bf B} $. The geometry of
the corresponding Stability Zones on the angular diagram in the space of
directions of $\, {\bf B} \, $ represents a very important characteristic of
the electron spectrum in a metal linking the parameters of the spectrum to the
experimental data. Here we will consider some very general features inherent in
the angular diagrams of metals with Fermi surfaces of the most arbitrary form.
In particular, we will show here that any Stability Zone actually has a second
boundary, restricting a larger region with a certain behavior of conductivity.
Besides that, we shall discuss here general questions of complexity of the
angular diagrams for the conductivity and propose a theoretical scheme for
dividing the angular diagrams into ""simple"" and ""complex"" diagrams. The
proposed scheme will in fact also be closely related to behavior of the Hall
conductivity in a metal in strong magnetic fields. In conclusion, we will also
discuss the relationship of the questions under consideration to the general
features of an (abstract) angular diagram describing the behavior of
quasiclassical electron trajectories at all energy levels in the conduction

is to grow the sample size by merging data across several datasets. However,
bias in datasets complicates this approach and includes additional sources of
variation in the data instead. In this work, we combine 15 large neuroimaging
datasets to study bias. First, we detect bias by demonstrating that scans can
be correctly assigned to a dataset with 73.3% accuracy. Next, we introduce
metrics to quantify the compatibility across datasets and to create embeddings
of neuroimaging sites. Finally, we incorporate the presence of bias for the
selection of a training set for predicting autism. For the quantification of
the dataset bias, we introduce two metrics: the Bhattacharyya distance between
datasets and the age prediction error. The presented embedding of neuroimaging
sites provides an interesting new visualization about the similarity of
different sites. This could be used to guide the merging of data sources, while
limiting the introduction of unwanted variation. Finally, we demonstrate a

prominence erupted asymmetrically near the southern footpoint which may be due
to uneven mass distribution and location of the cavity near southern footpoint.
Furthermore, we study the swirling motion of the plasma along different
circular paths in the cavity of the prominence after the prominence eruption.
The rotational velocities of the plasma moving along different circular paths
are estimated to be $\sim$ 9-40 km s$^{-1}$. These swirling motions can be
explained in terms of twisted magnetic field lines in the prominence cavity.

  Multi-Path-Geometry Approach","34 pages, this work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible
  publication",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate vehicular sensing is a basic and important operation in autonomous
driving. Unfortunately, the existing techniques have their own limitations. For
instance, the communication-based approach (e.g., transmission of GPS
information) has high latency and low reliability while the reflection-based
approach (e.g., RADAR) is incapable of detecting hidden vehicles (HVs) without
line-of-sight. This is arguably the reason behind some recent fatal accidents
involving autonomous vehicles. To address this issue, this paper presents a
novel HV-sensing technology that exploits multi-path transmission from a HV to
a sensing vehicle (SV). The powerful technology enables the SV to detect
multiple HV-state parameters including position, orientation of driving
direction, and size. Its implementation does not even require
transmitter-receiver synchronization like conventional mobile positioning
techniques. Our design approach leverages estimated information on multi-path
(AoA/AoD/ToA) and their geometric relations. As a result, a complex system of
equations or optimization problems, where the desired HV-state parameters are
variables, can be formulated for different channel-noise conditions. The
development of intelligent solution methods ranging from least-square estimator
to disk/box minimization yields a set of practical HV-sensing techniques. We
study their feasibility conditions in terms of the required number of paths.
Furthermore, practical solutions, including sequential path combining and
random directional beamforming, are proposed to enable HV-sensing given
insufficient paths. Last, realistic simulation of driving in both highway and
rural scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. In
summary, the proposed technique will enhance the capabilities of existing
vehicular sensing technologies by enabling HV-sensing.

optimization wrt. utility. Agents in a CAS may be self-interested, while their
utilities may depend on other agents' choices. Independent optimization of
agent utilities may yield poor individual and global reward due to locally
interfering individual preferences. Joint optimization may scale poorly, and is
impossible if agents cannot expose their preferences due to privacy or security
issues. In this paper, we study utility sharing for mitigating this issue.
Sharing utility with others may incentivize individuals to consider choices
that are locally suboptimal but increase global reward. We illustrate our
approach with a utility sharing variant of distributed cross entropy
optimization. Empirical results show that utility sharing increases expected
individual and global payoff in comparison to optimization without utility
sharing. We also investigate the effect of greedy defectors in a CAS of
sharing, self-interested agents. We observe that defection increases the mean
expected individual payoff at the expense of sharing individuals' payoff. We
empirically show that the choice between defection and sharing yields a
fundamental dilemma for self-interested agents in a CAS.

Vehicle-to-vehicle communications (V2V) is established with Mode 4, where the
devices schedule their transmissions in a distributed way employing
sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling (SPS). Research is needed to assess
the performance of SPS, especially in congested radio environments. This paper
presents the first open-source C-V2X simulator that enables such research. The
simulator is implemented in ns-3. We analyze the effect of the Mode 4 resource

probability has little effect in dense vehicular highway scenarios. Our results
show that proper configuration of scheduling parameters can significantly
improve performance. We conclude that research on congestion control mechanisms

fusion improves creditworthiness evaluations by synthesizing the prediction

  Task-specific Nonconvex Optimization",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Operator splitting methods have been successfully used in computational
sciences, statistics, learning and vision areas to reduce complex problems into
a series of simpler subproblems. However, prevalent splitting schemes are
mostly established only based on the mathematical properties of some general
optimization models. So it is a laborious process and often requires many
iterations of ideation and validation to obtain practical and task-specific
optimal solutions, especially for nonconvex problems in real-world scenarios.
To break through the above limits, we introduce a new algorithmic framework,
called Learnable Bregman Splitting (LBS), to perform deep-architecture-based
operator splitting for nonconvex optimization based on specific task model.
Thanks to the data-dependent (i.e., learnable) nature, our LBS can not only
speed up the convergence, but also avoid unwanted trivial solutions for
real-world tasks. Though with inexact deep iterations, we can still establish
the global convergence and estimate the asymptotic convergence rate of LBS only
by enforcing some fairly loose assumptions. Extensive experiments on different
applications (e.g., image completion and deblurring) verify our theoretical
results and show the superiority of LBS against existing methods.

real-world applications. Deep Belief Network (DBN) is a machine learning
technique that is effective in classification tasks. However, conventional DBN
does not work well for imbalanced data classification because it assumes equal
costs for each class. To deal with this problem, cost-sensitive approaches
assign different misclassification costs for different classes without
disrupting the true data sample distributions. However, due to lack of prior
knowledge, the misclassification costs are usually unknown and hard to choose
in practice. Moreover, it has not been well studied as to how cost-sensitive
learning could improve DBN performance on imbalanced data problems. This paper
proposes an evolutionary cost-sensitive deep belief network (ECS-DBN) for
imbalanced classification. ECS-DBN uses adaptive differential evolution to
optimize the misclassification costs based on training data, that presents an
effective approach to incorporating the evaluation measure (i.e. G-mean) into
the objective function. We first optimize the misclassification costs, then
apply them to deep belief network. Adaptive differential evolution optimization
is implemented as the optimization algorithm that automatically updates its
corresponding parameters without the need of prior domain knowledge. The
experiments have shown that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art on both benchmark datasets and real-world dataset for fault

both cases motivated by mere interpretational requirements for realism of the

within the framework of operational probabilistic theories. It is a genuinely
theoretical notion, corresponding to establish a definite partial order among

space. The causality notion is logically completely independent of the
misidentified concept of ""determinism"", and, being a consequence of quantum
theory, is ubiquitous in physics. In addition, as classical theory can be
regarded as a restriction of quantum theory, causality holds also in the
classical case, although the determinism of the theory trivializes it. I then
conclude arguing that causality naturally establishes an arrow of time. This
implies that the scenario of the ""Block Universe"" and the connected ""Past
Hypothesis"" are incompatible with causality, and thus with quantum theory: they
both are doomed to remain mere interpretations and, as such, not falsifiable,
similar to the hypothesis of ""super-determinism"". This article is part of a

optimize pinning control. When individual node dynamics and coupling strength
of the network are given, the effectiveness of pinning scheme can be measured
by the smallest eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian matrix obtained by
deleting the rows and columns corresponding to the pinned nodes from the
Laplacian matrix of the network. The larger this smallest eigenvalue, the more

are analyzed using the network topology information, including the spectrum of
the network Laplacian matrix, the minimal degree of uncontrolled nodes, the
number of edges between the controlled node set and the uncontrolled node set,
etc. The identified properties are shown effective for optimizing the pinning
control strategy, as demonstrated by illustrative examples. Finally, for both
scale-free and small-world networks, in order to maximize their corresponding

  Synchronization",,,,,"cs.AI cs.CV cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In mulsemedia applications, traditional media content (text, image, audio,
video, etc.) can be related to media objects that target other human senses
(e.g., smell, haptics, taste). Such applications aim at bridging the virtual
and real worlds through sensors and actuators. Actuators are responsible for
the execution of sensory effects (e.g., wind, heat, light), which produce
sensory stimulations on the users. In these applications sensory stimulation
must happen in a timely manner regarding the other traditional media content
being presented. For example, at the moment in which an explosion is presented
in the audiovisual content, it may be adequate to activate actuators that
produce heat and light. It is common to use some declarative multimedia
authoring language to relate the timestamp in which each media object is to be
presented to the execution of some sensory effect. One problem in this setting
is that the synchronization of media objects and sensory effects is done
manually by the author(s) of the application, a process which is time-consuming
and error prone. In this paper, we present a bimodal neural network
architecture to assist the synchronization task in mulsemedia applications. Our
approach is based on the idea that audio and video signals can be used
simultaneously to identify the timestamps in which some sensory effect should
be executed. Our learning architecture combines audio and video signals for the
prediction of scene components. For evaluation purposes, we construct a dataset
based on Google's AudioSet. We provide experiments to validate our bimodal
architecture. Our results show that the bimodal approach produces better

incoherent X-ray pulses from bremsstrahlung. These short X-ray pulses are
produced in the laser-plasma interaction of a 35 fs, 1 mJ pulse of a Ti:Sa
laser of 1 kHz repetition rate, with a solid metallic target. In this paper, we
report our developments to improve the stability of this micron size source of
ultrashort X-rays. As the Rayleigh length is very small (<15 micron), wobbling
of the rotatory stage can reduce the intensity on target and change the
characteristics of the source. We describe the methods we have developed to
measure and adjust the stability of the focus on target. These advances are
important for the development of sources with high average power and good
stability. The X-ray source has a broad Maxwellian-like distribution with
temperatures of around 10 - 40 KeV and could be used for advanced X-ray imaging
such as absorption or phase contrast tomography.

variety of graphics intensive mobile applications, which allow users to
interact and navigate through large scenes such as ancient places, museums and
even virtual cities. These applications support many clients and impose a heavy
requirement on network resources and computational resources. One key issue in
the design of cost efficient mobile walkthrough applications is the data
transmission between servers and mobile client devices. In this paper, we
propose an effective progressive mesh transmission framework that stores and
divide scene objects into different resolutions. This way, each mobile
progressively receives and process the only object's details that match with
its display resolution, and hence improving the user's perception and overall
system's response time. A fine grained cache mechanism is used to keep the most
frequently requested objects' details in the device memory and consequently
reduce the network traffics. Lastly, practical experiments are carried out to
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under various setting of
the virtual scene and mobile devices configuration/types.

through Nyquist pulse modulation, the high stability and mutual coherence among
mode-locked Kerr comb lines are exploited for the first time to eliminate the
guard intervals between communication channels and achieve full spectral

to total bitrate of 6.885 Tb/s within 2.295 THz frequency comb bandwidth. Our
study confirms that high coherence is the key superiority of Kerr soliton
frequency combs over independent laser diodes, as a multi-spectral coherent
laser source for high-bandwidth high-spectral-density transmission networks.

potential applications in smart buildings, for instance, in developing

for indoor localization in this paper. The system processes data from
transmitters (i.e., anchor nodes) and delivers the calculated position of a
receiver. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is then employed to
obtain the optimal configuration of the proposed fuzzy logic controllers
(FLCs). Specifically, the proposed PSO technique optimizes the membership
functions of the FLCs by adjusting their range to achieve the best results
regarding the localization reliability. We demonstrate the utility of the
proposed approach using experiments.

  inflammation-related MMP upregulation","23 oages, 6 figures, 2 schemes, 2 tables (accepted)","Journal of Materials Chemistry B 2018",,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Medical devices with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) modulating functionality
are highly desirable to restore tissue homeostasis in critical inflammation
states, such as chronic wounds, rotator cuff tears and cancer. The introduction
of MMP-modulating functionality in such devices is typically achieved via
loading of either rapidly-diffusing chelating factors, e.g. EDTA, or
MMP-cleavable substrates, raising issues in terms of non-controllable
pharmacokinetics and enzymatic degradability, respectively. Aiming to
accomplish inherent, long-term, device-induced MMP regulation, this study
investigated the synthesis of a hydroxamic acid (HA)-methacrylated collagen
conjugate as the building block of a soluble factor-free MMP-modulating
hydrogel network with controlled enzymatic degradability. This was realised via
a two-step synthetic route: (i) type I collagen was functionalised with
photonetwork-inducing methacrylic anhydride (MA) adducts; (ii) this
methacrylated product was activated with a water-soluble carbodiimide prior to
reaction with hydroxylamine, resulting in MMP-chelating HA functions.
Nearly-quantitative methacrylation of collagen amines was observed via
2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) assay. The molar content of HA
adducts was indirectly quantified via conversion of remaining carboxyl
functions into ethylenediamine (EDA), so that 12-16 mol.% HA was revealed in
the conjugate. Resulting UV cured, HA-bearing collagen hydrogels proved to
induce up to ~13 and ~32 RFU% activity reduction of MMP-9 and MMP-3,
respectively, following 4-day incubation in vitro. No hydrogel-induced toxic
response was observed following 4-day culture of G292 cells. The novel
synthetic strategies described in this work provide a new insight into the
systematic chemical manipulation of collagen materials aiming at the design of
biomimetic, inflammation-responsive medical devices.
