of energy. We perform a study of the polarization signatures from these models
by integrating the radiative transfer equations for synchrotron radiation using
as inputs the RMHD solutions. These simulations show a top-down emission
asymmetry produced by the helical magnetic field and a progressive confinement
of the emission into a jet spine as the magnetization increases and the
internal energy of the non-thermal population is considered to be a constant
fraction of the thermal one. Bright stationary components associated with the
recollimation shocks appear presenting a relative intensity modulated by the
Doppler boosting ratio between the pre-shock and post-shock states. Small
viewing angles show a roughly bimodal distribution in the polarization angle
due to the helical structure of the magnetic field, which is also responsible
for the highly stratified degree of linear polarization across the jet width.
In addition, small variations of the order of $26^\circ$ are observed in the
polarization angle of the stationary components, which can be used to identify
recollimation shocks in astrophysical jets.

processes. Most likely due to instrumental limitations and their natural
faintness, little is known about debris disks around low-mass stars, especially
when it comes to spatially resolved observations. We present new VLT/SPHERE
IRDIS Dual-Polarization Imaging (DPI) observations in which we detect the dust
ring around the M2 spectral type star TWA\,7. Combined with additional Angular
Differential Imaging observations we aim at a fine characterization of the
debris disk and setting constraints on the presence of low-mass planets. We
model the SPHERE DPI observations and constrain the location of the small dust
grains, as well as the spectral energy distribution of the debris disk, using
the results inferred from the observations, and perform simple N-body
simulations. We find that the dust density distribution peaks at 25 au, with a
very shallow outer power-law slope, and that the disk has an inclination of 13
degrees with a position angle of 90 degrees East of North. We also report low
signal-to-noise detections of an outer belt at a distance of ~52 au from the
star, of a spiral arm in the Southern side of the star, and of a possible dusty
clump at 3.9 au. These findings seem to persist over timescales of at least a
year. Using the intensity images, we do not detect any planets in the close
vicinity of the star, but the sensitivity reaches Jovian planet mass upper
limits. We find that the SED is best reproduced with an inner disk at 7 au and
another belt at 25 au. We report the detections of several unexpected features
in the disk around TWA\,7. A yet undetected 100 M$_\oplus$ planet with a
semi-major axis at 20-30 au could possibly explain the outer belt as well as
the spiral arm. We conclude that stellar winds are unlikely to be responsible
for the spiral arm.

length of such a word. In this paper, we are interested in families of Boolean

monotone networks is $O(n^3)$. We then exhibit two families of monotone

quiescent state since at least early 2015, reactivated between 2017 March 19
and April 5. The radio flux density, while variable, is approximately 100x
larger than during its dormant state. The X-ray flux one month after
reactivation was at least 800x larger than during quiescence, and has been
decaying exponentially on a 111+/-19 day timescale. This high-flux state,
together with a radio-derived rotational ephemeris, enabled for the first time
the detection of X-ray pulsations for this magnetar. At 5%, the 0.3-6 keV
pulsed fraction is comparable to the smallest observed for magnetars. The
overall pulsar geometry inferred from polarized radio emission appears to be
broadly consistent with that determined 6-8 years earlier. However, rotating
vector model fits suggest that we are now seeing radio emission from a
different location in the magnetosphere than previously. This indicates a novel
way in which radio emission from magnetars can differ from that of ordinary
pulsars. The torque on the neutron star is varying rapidly and unsteadily, as
is common for magnetars following outburst, having changed by a factor of 7
within six months of reactivation.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/sty863",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To date, there is no explanation as to why disc-tracing CO first overtone (or
`bandhead') emission is not a ubiquitous feature in low- to medium-resolution
spectra of massive young stellar objects, but instead is only detected toward
approximately 25 per cent of their spectra. In this paper, we investigate the
hypothesis that only certain mass accretion rates result in detectable bandhead
emission in the near infrared spectra of MYSOs. Using an analytic disc model
combined with an LTE model of the CO emission, we find that high accretion
rates ($\gtrsim 10^{-4}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in large
dust sublimation radii, a larger contribution to the $K$-band continuum from
hot dust at the dust sublimation radius, and therefore correspondingly lower CO
emission with respect to the continuum. On the other hand, low accretion rates
($\lesssim10^{-6}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in smaller dust
sublimation radii, a correspondingly smaller emitting area of CO, and thus also
lower CO emission with respect to the continuum. In general, moderate accretion
rates produce the most prominent, and therefore detectable, CO first overtone
emission. We compare our findings to a recent near-infrared spectroscopic
survey of MYSOs, finding results consistent with our hypothesis. We conclude
that the detection rate of CO bandhead emission in the spectra of MYSOs could
be the result of MYSOs exhibiting a range of mass accretion rates, perhaps due
to the variable accretion suggested by recent multi-epoch observations of these
objects.

have substantial advantages at high data rates, even compared to turbo linear

an attractive solution. In this paper, we derive an iterative DFE-IC,
capitalizing on the use of soft feedback based on expectation propagation,
along with the use of prior information for improved filtering and interference
cancellation. This DFE-IC significantly outperforms exact turbo LE-IC,
especially at high spectral efficiency, and also exhibits various advantages
and performance improvements over existing variants of DFE-IC. The proposed
scheme can also be self-iterated, as done in the recent trend on EP-based
equalizers, and it is shown to be an attractive alternative to linear
self-iterated receivers. For time-varying (TV) filter equalizers, an efficient
matrix inversion scheme is also proposed, considerably reducing the
computational complexity relative to existing methods. Using finite-length and
asymptotic analysis on a severely selective channel, the proposed DFE-IC is
shown to achieve higher rates than known alternatives, with better waterfall
thresholds and faster convergence, while keeping a similar computational
complexity.

cooling of the atomic beam by means of Doppler spectroscopy on a 136 kHz broad
transition at 626 nm. Furthermore, we demonstrate the characterization and
optimization procedure for the loading phase of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) by
increasing the effective laser linewidth by sideband modulation. After
optimization of the MOT compression phase, we cool and trap up to $10^9$ atoms
within 3 seconds in the MOT at temperatures of 9 {\mu}K and phase space

loading the atoms into an optical dipole trap and for subsequent forced

35.9 fb$^{-1}$ at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The Z boson pair decays
are reconstructed using the 4$\ell$, 2$\ell$2q, and 2$\ell$2$\nu$ final states,

scalar resonance are considered, with a free parameter describing their
relative cross sections. A dedicated categorization of events, based on the
kinematic properties of associated jets, and matrix element techniques are
employed for an optimal signal and background separation. A description of the
interference between signal and background amplitudes for a resonance of an
arbitrary width is included. No significant excess of events with respect to
the standard model expectation is observed and limits are set on the product of
the cross section for a new scalar boson and the branching fraction for its

server need to scale out to multiple servers. Typically, scaling out entails
assigning a different partition of the application state to each server. But
data partitioning is at odds with preserving the strong consistency guarantees
of ACID transactions, a fundamental building block of many OLTP applications.
The more we scale out and spread data across multiple servers, the more
frequent distributed transactions accessing data at different servers will be.
With a large number of servers, the high cost of distributed transactions makes
scaling out ineffective or even detrimental.
  In this paper we propose Operation Partitioning, a novel paradigm to scale
out OLTP applications that require ACID guarantees. Operation Partitioning
indirectly partitions data across servers by partitioning the application's
operations through static analysis. This partitioning of operations yields to a
lock-free Conveyor Belt protocol for distributed coordination, which can scale
out unmodified applications running on top of unmodified database management
systems. We implement the protocol in a system called Elia and use it to scale
out two applications, TPC-W and RUBiS. Our experiments show that Elia can
increase maximum throughput by up to 4.2x and reduce latency by up to 58.6x
compared to MySQL Cluster while at the same time providing a stronger isolation
guarantee (serializability instead of read committed).

scientific method. The choice of subsystems, however, is not defined a priori.
Typically, it is dictated by experimental capabilities, which may be different
for different agents. Here we propose a way to define subsystems in general
physical theories, including theories beyond quantum and classical mechanics.
Our construction associates every agent A with a subsystem SA, equipped with
its set of states and its set of transformations. In quantum theory, this
construction accommodates the notion of subsystems as factors of a tensor
product Hilbert space, as well as the notion of subsystems associated to a
subalgebra of operators. Classical systems can be interpreted as subsystems of
quantum systems in different ways, by applying our construction to agents who
have access to different sets of operations, including multiphase covariant
channels and certain sets of free operations arising in the resource theory of
quantum coherence. After illustrating the basic definitions, we restrict our
attention to closed systems, that is, systems where all physical
transformations act invertibly and where all states can be generated from a
fixed initial state. For closed systems, we propose a dynamical definition of
pure states, and show that all the states of all subsystems admit a canonical
purification. This result extends the purification principle to a broader
setting, in which coherent superpositions can be interpreted as purifications
of incoherent mixtures.

thermal fluid and a non-thermal component represented by relativistic charged
particles, or cosmic rays (CR). While the fluid is approached using standard
numerical schemes for magnetohydrodynamics, CR particles are treated
kinetically using conventional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) techniques.
  The module can be used to describe either test particles motion in the fluid
electromagnetic field or to solve the fully coupled MHD-PIC system of equations
with particle backreaction on the fluid as originally introduced by
\cite{Bai_etal.2015}. Particle backreaction on the fluid is included in the
form of momentum-energy feedback and by introducing the CR-induced Hall term in
Ohm's law. The hybrid MHD-PIC module can be employed to study CR kinetic
effects on scales larger than the (ion) skin depth provided the Larmor gyration
scale is properly resolved. When applicable, this formulation avoids to resolve
microscopic scales offering a substantial computational saving with respect to
PIC simulations.
  We present a fully-conservative formulation which is second-order accurate in
time and space and extends to either Runge-Kutta (RK) or
corner-transport-upwind (CTU) time-stepping schemes (for the fluid) while a
standard Boris integrator is employed for the particles. For highly-energetic
relativistic CRs and in order to overcome the time step restriction a novel
sub-cycling strategy that retains second-order accuracy in time is presented.
Numerical benchmarks and applications including Bell instability, diffusive
shock acceleration and test particle acceleration in reconnecting layers are

  Objective: This study aims to identify specific challenges, proposed
solutions, and unsolved problems faced when testing scientific software.
  Method: We conducted a systematic literature survey to identify and analyze
relevant literature. We identified 62 studies that provided relevant
information about testing scientific software.
  Results: We found that challenges faced when testing scientific software fall
into two main categories: (1) testing challenges that occur due to
characteristics of scientific software such as oracle problems and (2) testing
challenges that occur due to cultural differences between scientists and the
software engineering community such as viewing the code and the model that it

potentially overcome these challenges and their limitations. Finally we
describe unsolved challenges and how software engineering researchers and

  Conclusions: Scientific software presents special challenges for testing.
Specifically, cultural differences between scientist developers and software
engineers, along with the characteristics of the scientific software make
testing more difficult. Existing techniques such as code clone detection can
help to improve the testing process. Software engineers should consider special
challenges posed by scientific software such as oracle problems when developing

have a flexible statistical model for this kind of data. In this paper, we
study a class of skewed distributions by invoking arguments as described by
Ferreira and Steel (2006, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 101:
823--829). In particular, we consider using the logistic kernel to derive a
class of univariate distribution called the truncated-logistic skew symmetric

simulation study is conducted to investigate the efficacy of the maximum

four independent iris recognition methods (three commercial and one academic)

iris quality decay over a period of up to 814 hours after death. This study
shows that post-mortem iris recognition may be close-to-perfect approximately 5

death. These conclusions contradict the statements present in past literature
that the iris is unusable as a biometrics shortly after death, and show that
the dynamics of post-mortem changes to the iris that are important for
biometric identification are more moderate than previously hypothesized. The
paper contains a thorough medical commentary that helps to understand which
post-mortem metamorphoses of the eye may impact the performance of automatic
iris recognition. We also show that post-mortem iris recognition works equally
well for images taken in near-infrared and when the red channel of

significantly worse performance. This paper conforms to reproducible research

the most comprehensive evaluation of post-mortem iris recognition and the

algorithmic manner will be a useful capability for business and research in
their search to understand what consumers think about their products or

Algorithms (GAs) for the task of automated text sentiment analysis. The GAs
learn whether words occurring in a text corpus are either sentiment or
amplifier words, and their corresponding magnitude. Sentiment words, such as
'horrible', add linearly to the final sentiment. Amplifier words in contrast,
which are typically adjectives/adverbs like 'very', multiply the sentiment of
the following word. This increases, decreases or negates the sentiment of the
following word. The sentiment of the full text is then the sum of these terms.
This approach grows both a sentiment and amplifier dictionary which can be
reused for other purposes and fed into other machine learning algorithms. We
report the results of multiple experiments conducted on large Amazon data sets.
The results reveal that our proposed approach was able to outperform several

networks, is one of the most prominent topics in network science and is
important for many applications. One type of mesoscale feature is community
structure, in which sets of nodes are densely connected internally but sparsely
connected to other dense sets of nodes. Two of the most popular approaches for
community detection are to maximize an objective function called ""modularity""
and to perform statistical inference using stochastic block models.
Generalizing work by Newman on monolayer networks (Physical Review E 94,

equivalent, under certain conditions, to maximizing the posterior probability
of community assignments under a suitably chosen stochastic block model. We
derive versions of this equivalence for various types of multilayer structure,
including temporal, multiplex, and multilevel networks. We consider cases in
which the key parameters are constant, as well as ones in which they vary
across layers; in the latter case, this yields a novel, layer-weighted version
of the modularity function. Our results also help address a longstanding
difficulty of multilayer modularity-maximization algorithms, which require the
specification of two sets of tuning parameters that have been difficult to
choose in practice. We show how to perform this parameter selection in a
statistically-grounded way, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on both synthetic and empirical networks.

the 1D gas slowly relaxes towards thermal equilibrium through the collisions

non-symmetric rank-2 tensor whose 16 components fulfill 11 constraints implied

standard description of massive gravitons. In generic spacetimes, the theory
does not show the massless limit and always propagates five degrees of freedom,

this paper, we derive a new expression for the magnetic moment of relativistic
runaway electrons, which is conserved significantly better than the standard
one. The new result includes one of the second-order corrections in the
standard guiding-center theory which, in case of runaway electrons with
$p_{\parallel}\gg p_{\perp}$, can peculiarly be of the same order as the
lowest-order term. The better conservation of the new magnetic moment also
explains the collisionless pitch-angle-scattering effect observed in full-orbit
simulations since it allows momentum transfer between the perpendicular and
parallel directions when the runaway electron is accelerated by an electric
field. While the derivation of the second-order correction to the magnetic
moment in general case would require the full extent of the relativistic
second-order guiding-center theory, we exploit the Lie-perturbation method at

integrating out bulk modes coupled to the curved space, which generate local

obtained with the FEROS spectrograph on the 2.2m MPG/ESO Telescope. The carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen abundances, 12C/13C ratios, and neutron-capture element
abundances were determined using synthetic spectra, and the main atmospheric
parameters and abundances of other chemical elements were determined from
equivalent widths of spectral lines. Results: We have determined abundances of
23 chemical elements for 13 evolved stars and 12C/13C ratios for six stars of
IC 4756. The mean metallicity of this cluster, as determined from nine definite
member stars, is very close to solar - [Fe/H] = -0.02 +/- 0.01. Abundances of
carbon, nitrogen, and sodium exhibit alterations caused by extra-mixing: the
mean 12C/13C ratio is lowered to 19 +/- 1.4, the C/N ratio is lowered to 0.79
+/- 0.05, and the mean [Na/Fe] value, corrected for deviations from the local
thermodynamical equilibrium encountered, is enhanced by 0.14 +/- 0.05 dex. We
compared our results to those by other authors with theoretical models.

single mechanism that has near optimal performance on every prior distribution.
We show that mechanisms with truthtelling equilibria, a.k.a., revelation

define the revelation gap to quantify the non-optimality of revelation
mechanisms. This study suggests that it is important to develop a theory for
the design of non-revelation mechanisms. Our analysis focuses on welfare
maximization in single-item auctions for agents with budgets and a natural
regularity assumption on their distribution of values. The all-pay auction (a
non-revelation mechanism) is the Bayesian optimal mechanism; as it is
prior-independent it is also the prior-independent optimal mechanism (a
1-approximation). We prove a lower bound on the prior-independent approximation
of revelation mechanisms of 1.013 and that the clinching auction (a revelation
mechanism) is a prior-independent $e \approx 2.714$ approximation. Thus the
revelation gap for single-item welfare maximization with public budget agents
is in $[1.013, e]$. Some of our analyses extend to the revenue objective,
position environments, and irregular distributions.

canonical example of emergent phenomena. Recent studies on the cuprates have
drawn attention to the appearance of competing correlations within vortex

inter-vortex interactions, especially at short range. This can have significant
consequences for vortex lattices wherein vortices are in close proximity to one
another. We consider the attractive Hubbard model, a prototypical model for
phase competition, with checkerboard charge density wave order appearing in
vortex cores. We use next-nearest-neighbour hopping, $t'$, to tune the strength
of competing order in the core. Using Bogoliubov deGennes mean field
simulations, we study the variation in quasiparticle gap, superfluid stiffness
and shear stiffness, as the core order is tuned. The presence of competing
order allows for a new defect: domain walls that separate regions with
different types of charge order overlying the vortex-laden superfluid
background. We find the energy cost of such domain walls. Our results indicate
a stable intermediate supersolid region with coexisting superfluid and charge
orders. At one end, this phase is unstable to melting of the vortex lattice
into a purely charge ordered state, possibly via an intervening liquid-like
state. At the other end, charge order becomes incoherent due to domain

$W(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ is the {\em wobbling group} of permutations
$\sigma:\mathbb{Z}^d \to \mathbb{Z}^d$ with bounded range). This is equivalent
to asking whether the action $(\mathbb{Z}/2\ \mathbb{Z})^{(\mathbb{Z}^d)}

partial answer to this question by introducing a natural strengthening of the
notion of extensive-amenability which we call diffuse-extensive-amenability.
  Our main result is that for any bounded degree graph $X$, the action
$W(X)\curvearrowright X$ is diffuse-extensively amenable if and only if $X$ is
recurrent. Our proof is based on the construction of suitable stochastic

exponentially unlikely to be sub-linear when $X$ is transient. This result
leads us to conjecture that the action $W(\mathbb{Z}^d) \curvearrowright

arXiv:1509.01611) of cuprate superconductors have inferred that the self-energy
exhibits critical scaling over an extended doping regime, thereby calling into
question the conventional wisdom that critical scaling exists only at isolated
points. In particular, this new state of matter, dubbed a power-law liquid, has
a self-energy whose imaginary part scales as
$\Sigma^{\prime\prime}\sim(\omega^{2}+\pi^{2}T^{2})^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha=1$
in the overdoped Fermi-liquid state and $\alpha\leq0.5$ in the optimal to
underdoped regime. Previously, we showed that this self-energy can arise from
interactions between electrons and unparticles, a scale-invariant sector that
naturally emerges from strong correlations. Here, taking the self-energy as a
given, we first reconstruct the real part of the self-energy. We find that the
resultant quasiparticle weight vanishes for any doping level less than optimal,
implying an absence of particle-like excitations in the underdoped regime.
Consequently, the Fermi velocity vanishes and the effective mass diverges for
$\alpha\leq\frac{1}{2}$, in agreement with earlier experimental observations.
We then use the self-energy to reconstruct the spectral function and compute
the superconducting $T_c$ within the BCS formalism. We find that the $T_c$ has
a dome-like structure, implying that broad scale invariance manifested in the
form of a power-law liquid is the likely cause of the superconducting dome in
the cuprates.

Centauri. Proxima Centauri's high stellar activity however casts doubt on the
habitability of Proxima b: sufficiently bright and frequent flares and any
associated proton events may destroy the planet's ozone layer, allowing lethal
levels of UV flux to reach its surface. In March 2016, the Evryscope observed
the first naked-eye-brightness superflare detected from Proxima Centauri.
Proxima increased in optical flux by a factor of ~68 during the superflare and
released a bolometric energy of 10^33.5 erg, ~10X larger than any
previously-detected flare from Proxima. Over the last two years the Evryscope
has recorded 23 other large Proxima flares ranging in bolometric energy from
10^30.6 erg to 10^32.4 erg; coupling those rates with the single superflare
detection, we predict at least five superflares occur each year. Simultaneous
high-resolution HARPS spectroscopy during the Evryscope superflare constrains
the superflare's UV spectrum and any associated coronal mass ejections. We use
these results and the Evryscope flare rates to model the photochemical effects
of NOx atmospheric species generated by particle events from this extreme
stellar activity, and show that the repeated flaring may be sufficient to
reduce the ozone of an Earth-like atmosphere by 90% within five years; complete
depletion may occur within several hundred kyr. The UV light produced by the
Evryscope superflare would therefore have reached the surface with ~100X the
intensity required to kill simple UV-hardy microorganisms, suggesting that life
would have to undergo extreme adaptations to survive in the surface areas of
Proxima b exposed to these flares.

the spin-orbit coupling and Hund's coupling in correlated $5d$ oxides. We
present new higher resolution RIXS data at the Re-L$_3$ edge in Ba$_2$YReO$_6$
which finds a previously unresolved peak splitting, providing further
confirmation of our theoretical predictions. Using ab initio electronic
structure calculations on Ba$_2$${\cal M}$ReO$_6$ (with ${\cal M}$=Re, Os, Ir)
we show that while the atomic limit yields a reasonable effective Hamiltonian
description of the experimental observations, effects such as $t_{2g}$-$e_g$
interactions and hybridization with oxygen are important. Our ab initio
estimate for the strength of the intersite exchange coupling shows that,
compared to the osmates, the exchange is one or two orders of magnitude weaker
in the rhenates and iridates, which may partly explain the suppression of
long-range magnetic order in the latter compounds. As a way to interpolate
between the site-localized picture and our electronic structure band
calculations, we discuss the spin-orbital levels of the ${\cal M}$O$_6$

plays a crucial role in influencing the habitability of the Earth analogues.
Inferences of the interior structure are impeded by a fundamental degeneracy
that exists between any model comprising more than two layers and observations
constraining just two bulk parameters: mass and radius. In this work, we show
that although the inverse problem is indeed degenerate, there exists two
boundary conditions that enables one to infer the minimum and maximum core
radius fraction, CRFmin and CRFmax. These hold true even for planets with light
volatile envelopes, but require the planet to be fully differentiated and that
layers denser than iron are forbidden. With both bounds in hand, a marginal CRF
can also be inferred by sampling in-between. After validating on the Earth, we
apply our method to Kepler-36b and measure CRFmin = (0.50 +/- 0.07), CRFmax =
(0.78 +/- 0.02), and CRFmarg = (0.64 +/- 0.11), broadly consistent with the
Earth's true CRF value of 0.55. We apply our method to a suite of hypothetical
measurements of synthetic planets to serve as a sensitivity analysis. We find
that CRFmin and CRFmax have recovered uncertainties proportional to the
relative error on the planetary density, but CRFmarg saturates to between 0.03

$U$. Depending on whether this symmetry holds for the first or second column of
$U$ different correlations between $\theta_{23}$ and $ \delta_{CP} $ can be
obtained. This symmetry can be obtained using discrete flavour symmetries. In
particular, all the subgroups of SU(3) with 3-dimensional irreducible
representation which are classified as class C or D can lead to partial
$\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry. We show how the predictions of this symmetry
compare with the allowed area in the $\sin^2\theta_{23} - \delta_{CP}$ plane as
obtained from the global analysis of neutrino oscillation data. Furthermore, we
study the possibility of testing these symmetries at the proposed DUNE and

strength between the cavity field and the atomic internal degrees of freedom of
the trapped atom by decreasing the mode volume of the cavity. In such systems,
it is natural to achieve strong atom-cavity coupling, where the coherent
interaction strength exceeds the cavity linewidth, while the linewidth exceeds
the atomic trap frequency. While most work focuses on coupling of photons to
the internal degrees of freedom, additional rich dynamics can occur by
considering the atomic motional degree of freedom as well. In particular, we
show that such a system is a natural candidate to explore an interesting regime
of quantum optomechanics, where the zero-point atomic motion yields a cavity
frequency shift larger than its linewidth (so-called single-photon
optomechanical strong coupling), but simultaneously where the motional
frequency cannot be resolved by the cavity. We show that this regime can result
in a number of remarkable phenomena, such as strong entanglement between the
atomic wave-function and the scattering properties of single incident photons,
or an anomalous mechanism where the atomic motion can significantly heat up due
to single-photon scattering, even if the atom is trapped tightly within the

have nitrogen enhancements of less than 0.3 dex, consistent with them having
experienced only small amounts of mixing. However, stars with low projected
rotational velocities <40 \kms and significant nitrogen enrichments are found
in both our samples and simulations imply that these cannot all be rapidly
rotating objects observed near pole-on. Adopting an enhancement threshold of
0.6 dex, we observed five stars, yet stellar evolution models with rotation
predict only 1.25$\pm$1.11 for random stellar viewing inclinations. The excess
of such objects is estimated to be 20-30% of all stars with current rotational

We explore TO principles to map the original 3-D BOR problem to a 2-D one in
the meridian plane based on a Cartesian coordinate system where the cylindrical
metric is fully embedded into the constitutive properties of an effective
inhomogeneous and anisotropic medium that fills the domain. The proposed solver
uses a TE/TM field decomposition and an appropriate set of DEC-based basis
functions on an irregular grid discretizing the meridian plane. A symplectic
time discretization based on a leap-frog scheme is applied to obtain the
full-discrete marching-on-time algorithm. We validate the algorithm by
comparing the numerical results against analytical solutions for resonant
fields in cylindrical cavities and against pseudo-analytical solutions for
fields radiated by cylindrically symmetric antennas in layered media. We also
illustrate the application of the algorithm for a particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulation of beam-wave interactions inside a high-power backward-wave
oscillator.

higher-order potentials are usually too complex to learn and often incur a high

approach to SP-HO-CRFs that resolves these problems. Our approach is a
multi-layer CRF framework that inherits the simplicity from pairwise CRFs by
formulating both the higher-order and pairwise cues into the same pairwise
potentials in the first layer. Essentially, this approach provides accuracy
enhancement on the basis of pairwise CRFs without training by reusing their
pre-trained parameters and/or weights. The proposed multi-layer approach
performs especially well in delineating the boundary details (boarders) of
object categories such as ""trees"" and ""bushes"". Multiple sets of experiments
conducted on dataset MSRC-21 and PASCAL VOC 2012 validate the effectiveness and

popularity and variety of computation-intensive applications with high
requirements for computational resources and analysis capabilities. Existing
network architectures and resource management mechanisms may not sufficiently
guarantee satisfactory Quality of Experience and network efficiency, mainly
suffering from coverage limitation of Road Side Units, insufficient resources,
and unsatisfactory computational capabilities of onboard equipment, frequently
changing network topology, and ineffective resource management schemes. To meet
the demands of such applications, in this article, we first propose a novel
architecture by integrating the satellite network with 5G cloud-enabled
Internet of Vehicles to efficiently support seamless coverage and global
resource management. A incentive mechanism based joint optimization problem of
opportunistic computation offloading under delay and cost constraints is
established under the aforementioned framework, in which a vehicular user can
either significantly reduce the application completion time by offloading
workloads to several nearby vehicles through opportunistic vehicle-to-vehicle
channels while effectively controlling the cost or protect its own profit by
providing compensated computing service. As the optimization problem is
non-convex and NP-hard, simulated annealing based on the Markov Chain Monte
Carlo as well as the metropolis algorithm is applied to solve the optimization
problem, which can efficaciously obtain both high-quality and cost-effective
approximations of global optimal solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed
mechanism is corroborated through simulation results.

activated behavior with an energy gap $\Delta$ = 57 meV between 67 K and 150 K.
At temperatures below 67 K, $\rho$($T$) is significantly lower than an
extrapolation of the activated behavior, and the Hall coefficient and
magneto-resistivity undergo a sign change in this region. At $\sim$19 K, a
transition from semiconducting to metallic-like behavior is observed with
deceasing temperature. Whereas the transition temperature is very robust in a
magnetic field, the magnitude of the resistivity below $\sim$30 K is very
sensitive to magnetic field. There is no indication of a bulk phase transition

reduced $\alpha$ width, $\gamma_{11}$, of the bound $1^-$ level in $^{16}$O is
particularly important to determine the cross section. The magnitude of
$\gamma_{11}$ is determined via sub-Coulomb $\alpha$-transfer reactions or the
$\beta$-delayed $\alpha$ decay of $^{16}$N, but the latter approach is
presently hampered by the lack of sufficiently precise data on the

leading to a substantial increase in $\gamma_{11}$. Our revised value for

studies and the weighted average of the two gives a robust and precise

velocity field. We thus favour the presence of a molecular outflow in the disk
with true velocities of $\sim$180 km s$^{-1}$ in the nucleus and decelerating
to 0 by $\sim$72 pc. The implied molecular outflow rate is
$5.6~[M_{o}yr^{-1}]$, with this gas accumulating in the nuclear 2 arcsec arms.
The ionized gas kinematics support an interpretation of a similar, but more
spherical, outflow in the inner 100 pc, with no signs of deceleration. There is
some evidence of streaming inflows of $\sim$50 km s$^{-1}$ along specific
spiral arms, and the estimated molecular mass inflow rate,
$\sim0.1~[M_{o}yr^{-1}]$, is significantly larger than the SMBH accretion rate
($\dot{m}=4.8\times10^{-5}~[M_{o}yr^{-1}]$).

Attention Localization Network (FPAN), which uses an image and a queried object
as input to accurately locate the target object in the image. Specifically, the
fine-grained attention module is naturally embedded into each layer of the
convolution neural network (CNN), thereby gradually suppressing the regions
that are irrelevant to the queried object and eventually shrinking attention to
the target area. We further employ top-down attentions fusion algorithm
operated by a learnable cascade up-sampling structure to establish the
connection between the attention map and the exact location of the queried
object in the original image. Furthermore, the FPAN is trained by multi-task
learning with box segmentation loss and cosine loss. At last, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on both queried-based digit localization and object
tracking with synthetic and benchmark datasets, respectively. The experimental
results show that our algorithm is far superior to other algorithms in the

implemented by incorporating fog and cloud platforms, and adopting the
homomorphic Paillier encryption and one-way hash chain techniques. This scheme
not only protects devices' privacy, but also achieves high efficiency.
Moreover, we introduce a fault tolerant (LPTD-II) framework which can
effectively overcome malfunctioning CIoT devices. Detailed security analysis

matter of continuous debate. Clear observational proof of the general influence
of magnetic fields on the early phase of cloud collapse is still pending. First
results on Bok globules with simple structures indicate dominant magnetic
fields across large spatial scales (Bertrang+2014).
  The aim of this study is to test the magnetic field influence across Bok
globules with more complex density structures. We apply near-infrared
polarimetry to trace the magnetic field structure on scales of 10^4-10^5au in
selected Bok globules. The combination of these measurements with archival data
in the optical and sub-mm wavelength range allows us to characterize the
magnetic field on scales of 10^3-10^6au.
  We present polarimetric data in the near-infrared wavelength range for the
three Bok globules CB34, CB56, and [OMK2002]18, combined with archival
polarimetric data in the optical wavelength range for CB34 and CB56, and in the
sub-millimeter wavelength range for CB34 and [OMK2002]18. We find a strong
polarization signal (P>2%) in the near-infrared and strongly aligned
polarization segments on large scales (10^4-10^6au) for all three globules.
  This indicates dominant magnetic fields across Bok globules with complex
density structures.
  To reconcile our findings in globules, the lowest mass clouds known, and the
results on intermediate (e.g., Taurus) and more massive (e.g., Orion) clouds,
we postulate a mass dependent role of magnetic fields, whereby magnetic fields
appear to be dominant on low and high mass but rather sub-dominant on
intermediate mass clouds.

editor augmentation tools and approaches. We manually reviewed the metadata of
5,553 articles published during the last twenty years in two phases -- keyword
search and references search. The result is a list of 103 relevant articles and
a taxonomy of source code editor augmentation tools with seven dimensions,
which we used to categorize the resulting list of the surveyed articles.
  We also provide the definition of the term source code editor augmentation,

  Wolleb-Graf","A Framework for Searching in Graphs in the Presence of Errors",,,,,"cs.DS cs.IT cs.LG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of searching for an unknown target vertex $t$ in a
(possibly edge-weighted) graph. Each \emph{vertex-query} points to a vertex $v$
and the response either admits $v$ is the target or provides any neighbor
$s\not=v$ that lies on a shortest path from $v$ to $t$. This model has been
introduced for trees by Onak and Parys [FOCS 2006] and for general graphs by
Emamjomeh-Zadeh et al. [STOC 2016]. In the latter, the authors provide
algorithms for the error-less case and for the independent noise model (where
each query independently receives an erroneous answer with known probability
$p<1/2$ and a correct one with probability $1-p$).
  We study this problem in both adversarial errors and independent noise
models. First, we show an algorithm that needs $\frac{\log_2 n}{1 - H(r)}$
queries against \emph{adversarial} errors, where adversary is bounded with its
rate of errors by a known constant $r<1/2$. Our algorithm is in fact a
simplification of previous work, and our refinement lies in invoking
amortization argument. We then show that our algorithm coupled with Chernoff
bound argument leads to an algorithm for independent noise that is simpler and
with a query complexity that is both simpler and asymptotically better to one
of Emamjomeh-Zadeh et al. [STOC 2016].
  Our approach has a wide range of applications. First, it improves and
simplifies Robust Interactive Learning framework proposed by Emamjomeh-Zadeh et
al. [NIPS 2017]. Secondly, performing analogous analysis for
\emph{edge-queries} (where query to edge $e$ returns its endpoint that is
closer to target) we actually recover (as a special case) noisy binary search
algorithm that is asymptotically optimal, matching the complexity of Feige et
al. [SIAM J. Comput. 1994]. Thirdly, we improve and simplify upon existing
algorithm for searching of \emph{unbounded} domains due to Aslam and Dhagat
[STOC 1991].

extent to which the chosen diffusion captures a typically unknown label
propagation mechanism, that can be specific to the underlying graph, and
potentially different for each class. The present work introduces a
disciplined, data-efficient approach to learning class-specific diffusion
functions adapted to the underlying network topology. The novel learning
approach leverages the notion of ""landing probabilities"" of class-specific

bright, compact (~2-3 pc FWHM) knots of dust emission. Most of these sources
are likely to be forming super star clusters (SSCs) based on their inferred
dynamical and gas masses, association with 36 GHz radio continuum emission, and
coincidence with line emission tracing dense, excited gas. One source coincides
with a known SSC, but the rest remain invisible in Hubble near-infrared (IR)
imaging. Our observations imply that gas still constitutes a large fraction of
the overall mass in these sources. Their high brightness temperature at 350 GHz
also implies a large optical depth near the peak of the IR spectral energy
distribution. As a result, these sources may have large IR photospheres and the
IR radiation force likely exceeds L/c. Still, their moderate observed velocity
dispersions suggest that feedback from radiation, winds, and supernovae are not
yet disrupting most sources. This mode of star formation appears to produce a
large fraction of stars in the burst. We argue for a scenario in which this
phase lasts ~1 Myr, after which the clusters shed their natal cocoons but
continue to produce ionizing photons. The strong feedback that drives the
observed cold gas and X-ray outflows likely occurs after the clusters emerge

existing approaches are less effective when the propagation environment is
heterogeneous. To cope with this, the present work introduces a piecewise

calibration. Calibration targets can come from randomized controlled trials,
observational studies, and expert opinion, and are typically summary
statistics. A well calibrated model can reproduce a wide range of targets. MSM
calibration generally involves searching a high dimensional parameter space and
predicting many targets through model simulation. This requires efficient
methods for exploring the parameter space and sufficient computational
resources. We develop Incremental Mixture Approximate Bayesian Computation
(IMABC) as a method for MSM calibration and implement it via a high-performance
computing workflow, which provides the necessary computational scale. IMABC
begins with a rejection-based approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) step,
drawing a sample of parameters from the prior distribution and simulating
calibration targets. Next, the sample is iteratively updated by drawing
additional points from a mixture of multivariate normal distributions, centered
at the points that yield simulated targets that are near observed targets.
Posterior estimates are obtained by weighting sampled parameter vectors to
account for the adaptive sampling scheme. We demonstrate IMABC by calibrating a
MSM for the natural history of colorectal cancer to obtain simulated draws from

evolution of the Schrodinger equation. In this paper, we propose that the gauge
choice (i.e. degrees of freedom irrelevant to physical observables) of the
Schrodinger equation can be generally non-optimal for numerical simulation.
This can limit, and in some cases severely limit the time step size. We find
that the optimal gauge choice is given by a parallel transport formulation.
This parallel transport dynamics can be simply interpreted as the dynamics
driven by the residual vectors, analogous to those defined in eigenvalue
problems in the time-independent setup. The parallel transport dynamics can be
derived from a Hamiltonian structure, thus suitable to be solved using a
symplectic and implicit time discretization scheme, such as the implicit
midpoint rule, which allows the usage of a large time step and ensures the long

open problem in social media analysis. Considerable progress has been made

simultaneously - e.g. microblogs or traditional media coverage. Here, we
propose RNN-MAS, a recurrent neural network for modeling asynchronous streams.
It is a sequence generator that connects multiple streams of different
granularity via joint inference. We show RNN-MAS not only to outperform the
current state-of-the-art Youtube popularity prediction system by 17%, but also
to capture complex dynamics, such as seasonal trends of unseen influence. We
define two new metrics: promotion score quantifies the gain in popularity from
one unit of promotion for a Youtube video; the loudness level captures the
effects of a particular user tweeting about the video. We use the loudness
level to compare the effects of a video being promoted by a single
highly-followed user (in the top 1% most followed users) against being promoted
by a group of mid-followed users. We find that results depend on the type of
content being promoted: superusers are more successful in promoting Howto and
Gaming videos, whereas the cohort of regular users are more influential for
Activism videos. This work provides more accurate and explainable popularity
predictions, as well as computational tools for content producers and marketers

spin absorption from any change in the spin injection and detection mechanisms.
As inferred from the thickness dependence, the effective spin current $j_e =

make temporal and spectral joint fits of the multiwavelength light curves of

predictions of the external shock model. The light curves are decomposed into
four typical phases: onset bump (Phase I), normal decay (Phase II), shallow

distribution (SED) evolves from prompt \gamma-ray emission to the afterglow
with photon index from $\Gamma_{\rm \gamma}=1.36$ to $\Gamma \approx 1.75$.
There is no obvious evolution of the SED during the afterglow. The
multiwavelength light curves from \gamma-ray to optical can be well modeled
with an external shock by considering energy injection, and a time-dependent
microphysics model with $\epsilon_B\propto t^{\alpha_B}$ for the emission at

investigate single-pulse GRBs in the Swift era, finding that only a small

correlated and uncorrelated nuclear states. We argue that the shorter-range
heavy-neutrino exchange is less sensitive to collective nuclear correlations,

long-range correlations in many-body calculations. Our analysis supports
previous studies suggesting that isoscalar pairing correlations, which affect

mainstream interpretations of probability, frequentist and Bayesian, to QM
(quantum mechanics) theory for the Bohm-EPR experiment. The joint probability
distribution for the possible spin outcomes for two particles with coupled
spins is examined. Contrasting conclusions are made: (i) Under the frequentist
interpretation, the QM spin distribution implies a widely-discussed
non-locality because probabilistic conditioning on a spin measurement is viewed
as corresponding to a causal influence. Under the Bayesian interpretation, this
conditioning is viewed as providing information relevant to the spin
probabilities and the argument for non-locality loses its force. (ii) The
frequentist interpretation leads to the locality condition used by John Bell in
1964 to establish conditions for the existence of hidden variables behind the
spin probability distribution but this condition is not consistent with the
product (Bayes) rule of probability theory. Under the Bayesian interpretation,
there is no motivation for this locality condition and a new stochastic
hidden-variable model is given that reproduces the spin distribution. (iii)
Bell's original 1964 inequality provides a necessary condition for the
existence of a third-order joint probability distribution for three spin
variables that is compatible through marginalization with the second-order
joint distributions for the three possible spin pairs. Bell's inequality is
logically equivalent to the 1969 CHSH inequality that involves expectations of
four pairs of four spin variables; the CHSH inequality must be satisfied in
order for a fourth-order joint probability distribution for the four spin
variables to exist. When any of these inequalities are violated, a joint
probability distribution for three spin outcomes fails to be valid because some
probabilities are negative.

achromatic steepening in GRB light curves, known as jet breaks. Identifying a
jet break from a GRB afterglow lightcurve allows a measurement of the jet
opening angle and true energetics of GRBs. In this paper, we reinvestigate this
problem using a large sample of GRBs that have an optical jet break which is
consistent with being achromatic in the X-ray band. Our sample includes 99 GRBs
from February 1997 to March 2015 that have optical and, for Swift GRBs, X-ray
lightcurves that are consistent with the jet break interpretation. Out of 99
GRBs we have studied, 55 GRBs are found to have temporal and spectral behaviors
both before and after the break consistent with the theoretical predictions of
the jet break models, respectively. These include 53 long/soft (Type II) and 2
short/hard (Type I) GRBs. Only 1 GRB is classified as the candidate of a jet
break with energy injection. Another 41 and 3 GRBs are classified as the
candidates with the lower and upper limits of the jet break time, respectively.
The typical beaming correction factor $f_b^{-1} \sim 1000$ for Type II GRBs,
suggesting an even higher total GRB event rate density in the universe. Both
isotropic and jet-corrected energies have a wide span in their distributions.
We also investigate several empirical correlations (Amati, Frail, Ghirlanda and
Liang-Zhang) previously discussed in the literature. We find that in general
most of these relations are less tight than before. The existence of early jet
breaks and hence small opening angle jets, which were detected in the {\em
Swfit era}, is most likely the source of scatter. If one limits the sample to
jet breaks later than $10^4$ s, the Liang-Zhang relation remains tight and the
Ghirlanda relation still exists. These relations are derived from Type II GRBs,
and Type I GRBs usually deviate from them.

repetitive activation through depletion of readily releasable neurotransmitter

is increased by prior activation. These competing effects can create a
complicated and subtle range of time dependent connectivity. Here we
investigate the probabilistic properties of facilitation and depression (FD)

use a model of FD that is parameterized with experimental data from a
hippocampal basket cell and pyramidal cell connection, for fixed frequency
input spikes at frequencies in the range of theta and gamma oscillations. Hence
our results will apply to micro-circuits in the hippocampus that are
responsible for the interaction of theta and gamma rhythms associated with
learning and memory. A control situation is compared with one in which a
pharmaceutical neuromodulator (muscarine) is employed. We apply standard
information theoretic measures such as entropy and mutual information, and find
a closed form approximate expression for the probability distribution of

response on the exact history of stimulation the synapse has received, which
uncovers some unexpected differences between control and muscarine-added cases.

studies in computer vision show that even a small modification of input image
intensities may cause a deep learning model to classify the image differently.
In medical imaging, the distribution of image intensities is related to applied
image reconstruction algorithm. In this paper we investigate the impact of
ultrasound image reconstruction method on breast lesion classification with
neural transfer learning. Due to high dynamic range raw ultrasonic signals are
commonly compressed in order to reconstruct B-mode images. Based on raw data
acquired from breast lesions, we reconstruct B-mode images using different
compression levels. Next, transfer learning is applied for classification.
Differently reconstructed images are employed for training and evaluation. We
show that the modification of the reconstruction algorithm leads to decrease of
classification performance. As a remedy, we propose a method of data
augmentation. We show that the augmentation of the training set with
differently reconstructed B-mode images leads to a more robust and efficient
classification. Our study suggests that it is important to take into account
image reconstruction algorithms implemented in medical scanners during
development of computer aided diagnosis systems.

ago, it is not yet universally considered to be a fundamental law of physics. A
major problem is that there are many materials having residual entropy.
Amorphous materials and random alloy systems are well-known examples. A
conventional view is that amorphous materials are not in thermodynamic
equilibrium and must be exempted from the law. The recent development of
material sciences has let to a variety of new materials. Some of them have
ambiguous structures which do not fit the qualitative description of
metastability. The definition of order states also becomes vague. The
establishment of an unambiguous statement which does not depend on the material
properties is required. This paper provides a quantitative expression for the
third law to meet this requirement. The idea is to introduce the notion of
class. Every system belongs to a class. Different classes are thermodynamically
separated by special internal constraints which are quantified by the frozen
coordinate, r. A frozen coordinate is a state variable that is not commonly
possessed between two classes. The third law is restated as all materials
within a given class have a common origin of entropy. For two systems belonging
to different classes, the entropy origins are shifted by the difference in
entropy associated with the difference r between the two systems. When the
internal constraint is removed, the entropy origin must be reconstructed in
order to establish only one thermodynamic equilibrium. This process is
irreversible and this irreversibility is observed as the residual entropy. On
the basis of this refinement, the residual entropies of amorphous materials as
well as the long-standing problem of mixed states can be treated on an equal
footing.

compared to a conventional multi-step method, and the global error behaves as
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon h^2)$ for roughly equal computational cost. For stiff
systems, we show that the splitting method retains stability in regimes where

asymmetric double peaks (east and west). Using 18.8 and 24.6\,$\mu$m images, we

privacy definition, which allows statistical aggregation while protecting
users' privacy without relying on a trusted third party. The notion of
context-awareness is incorporated in LIP by the introduction of priors, which
enables the design of privacy-preserving data aggregation with knowledge of
priors. We show that LIP relaxes the Localized Differential Privacy (LDP)
notion by explicitly modeling the adversary's knowledge. However, it is
stricter than $2\epsilon$-LDP and $\epsilon$-mutual information privacy. The
incorporation of local priors allows LIP to achieve higher utility compared to
other approaches. We then present an optimization framework for
privacy-preserving data aggregation, with the goal of minimizing the expected
squared error while satisfying the LIP privacy constraints. Utility-privacy
tradeoffs are obtained under several models in closed-form. We then validate
our analysis by {numerical analysis} using both synthetic and real-world data.
Results show that our LIP mechanism provides better utility-privacy tradeoffs
than LDP and when the prior is not uniformly distributed, the advantage of LIP
is even more significant.

to select a number of fingerprints out of a large pool of candidates, based on
the correlations that are intrinsic to the training data. This procedure can

like total variation, are based on ad-hoc assumptions that have difficulties to
represent the actual distribution of natural images. Thus, a key challenge in
research on image processing is to find better suited priors to represent
natural images.
  In this work, we propose the Adaptive Quantile Sparse Image (AQuaSI) prior.
It is based on a quantile filter, can be used as a joint filter on guidance
data, and be readily plugged into a wide range of numerical optimization
algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed prior in joint
RGB/depth upsampling, on RGB/NIR image restoration, and in a comparison with
related regularization by denoising approaches.

date, coronal seismology has successfully been applied to various

the robustness and accuracy of magnetic field diagnostics applied to
forward-modeled 3D MHD simulations of propagating Alfv\'enic waves. We find
that the seismologically measured magnetic field values are reassuringly close
to the input value (within 20%) for a range of setups studied, providing
encouragement and confidence for the further development of dynamic coronal
seismology.

$m$ and $p$, and have a topological order with a neutral sector characterized
by the orbifold conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$ at radius
$R=\sqrt{p/2}$. When $p=1$ the state is Abelian. The state with $p=3$ is the
$Z_4$ Read Rezayi state, and the series of $p\ge 3$ defines a sequence of
non-Abelian states that resembles the Laughlin sequence. Our model is based on
clustering of electrons in groups of four, and is formulated as a two fluid
model in which each wire exhibits two phases: a weak clustered phase, where
charge $e$ electrons coexist with charge $4e$ bosons and a strong clustered
phase where the electrons are strongly bound in groups of 4. The transition
between these two phases on a wire is mapped to the critical point of the 4
state clock model, which in turn is described by the orbifold conformal field
theory. For an array of wires coupled in the presence of a perpendicular
magnetic field, strongly clustered wires form a charge $4e$ bosonic Laughlin
state with a chiral charge mode at the edge, but no neutral mode and a gap for
single electrons. Coupled wires near the critical state form quantum Hall
states with a gapless neutral mode described by the orbifold theory. The
coupled wire approach allows us to employ the Abelian bosonization technique to
fully analyze the physics of single wire, and then to extract most topological
properties of the resulting non-Abelian quantum Hall states. These include the
list of quasiparticles, their fusion rules, the correspondence between bulk
quasiparticles and edge topological sectors, and most of the phases associated

minimizing the nonlinear distortions in the direction of the intended receiver.
This feature is highly desirable, since emissions in other directions are
naturally weak due to beamforming. The proposed parameter learning technique
requires only a single observation receiver, and therefore supports simple
hardware implementation. It is also shown to clearly outperform the current
state-of-the-art technique which utilizes only a single PA for learning.
Analysis of the feedback network amplitude and phase imbalances reveals that
the technique is robust even to high levels of such imbalances. Finally, we
also show that the array system out-of-band emissions are well-behaving in all

frequencies can be offset from the spin frequency of the NS by several Hz, and
can drift by 1-3 Hz. One possible explanation is a mode in the bursting ocean,
the frequency of which would decrease (in the rotating frame) as the burst
cools, hence explaining the drifts. Most burst oscillations have been observed
during H/He triggered bursts, however there has been one observation of
oscillations during a superburst; hours' long Type I X-ray bursts caused by
unstable carbon burning deeper in the ocean. This paper calculates the
frequency evolution of an oceanic r-mode during a superburst. The rotating
frame frequency varies during the burst from 4-14 Hz, and is sensitive to the
background parameters, in particular the temperature of the ocean and ignition
depth. This calculation is compared to the superburst oscillations observed on
4U-1636-536. The predicted mode frequencies ($\sim$ 10 Hz) would require a spin
frequency of $\sim$ 592 Hz to match observations; 6 Hz higher than the spin

to find undetected planets in temporal sequences of images, even if they are
spread over orbital time scales. As expected, the typical gain in S/N ratio is
sqrt(n), n being the number of observations combined. We find that the
K-Stacker algorithm is able de-orbit and combine the images to reach a level of
performance similar to what could be expected if the planet was not moving. We
find recovery rates of 50% at S/N=5. We also find that the algorithm is able to
determine the position of the planet in individual frames at one pixel
precision, even despite the fact that the planet itself is below the detection
limit in each frame. Our simulations show that K-Stacker can be used to
increase the contrast limit of current exoplanet imaging instruments and to
discover fainter bodies. We also suggest that the ability of K-Stacker to
determine the position of the planet in every image of the time serie could be
used as part of a new observing strategy in which long exposures would be
broken into shorter ones spread over months. This could make possible to
determine the orbital parameters of a planet without requiring multiple high
S/N > 5 detections.

independent scale factors. The numerical analysis shows that there exist a
phenomenologically realistic compactification regime where the three
dimensional hubble parameter and the extra dimensional scale factor tend to a
constant. This result comes as surprise as in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity
this regime exists only when the couplings of the theory are such that the
theory does not admit a maximally symmetric solution (i.e. ""geometric
frustration""). In cubic Lovelock gravity however there always exists at least
one maximally symmetric solution which makes it fundamentally different from
the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet case. Moreover, in opposition to
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity, it is also found that for some values of the
couplings and initial conditions these compactification regimes can coexist
with isotropizing solutions.

the development of new control paradigms for the coordination of

(MGs) are an interesting way to locally manage groups of generation devices,
but they cannot singularly provide a significant contribution to sustain the
main electricity grid in terms of ancillary services, such as the availability
of a minimum amount of power reserve for the frequency regulation. For these
reasons, in this paper we propose a framework for the aggregation and
coordination of interconnected MGs to provide ancillary services to the main
utility. The proposed framework is structured in three main phases. In the
first one, a distributed optimization algorithm computes the day-ahead profile
of the active power production of the MGs based on the available forecasts of
the renewable sources production and the loads absorption. In this phase,
scalability of the optimization problem and confidentiality requirements are
guaranteed. In the second phase, reactive power flows are scheduled and it is
ensured that the active power trends planned in the first phase do not
compromise the voltage/current limitations. A final third phase is used to
schedule the active and reactive power profiles of the generation units of each
MG to make them consistent with the requirements and results of the previous
two phases. The developed method is used for control of the IEEE 13-bus system
network and the results achieved are thoroughly discussed in terms of
performance and scalability properties.

report radio interferometric observations of 3C 84 (NGC 1275), the central

the edge-brightened jet in 3C 84 only 30 microarcseconds from the core, which
is ten times closer to the central engine than what has been possible in
previous ground-based observations, and it allows us to measure the jet
collimation profile from ~ 100 to ~10000 gravitational radii from the black
hole. The previously found, almost cylindrical jet profile on scales larger
than a few thousand r_g is now seen to continue at least down to a few hundred
r_g from the black hole and we find a broad jet with a transverse radius larger
than about 250 r_g at only 350 r_g from the core. If the bright outer jet layer
is launched by the black hole ergosphere, it has to rapidly expand laterally on
scales smaller than 100 r_g. If this is not the case, then this jet sheath is
likely launched from the accretion disk.

compressing the fusion pellet to supersolid densities is accomplished by the
conventional high energy nanosecond glass lasers and the task of igniting the
compressed pellet is given to a high intensity, moderate energy pico second
source which can set the pellet ablaze (with DT fusion reactions) by creating
an adequate size hot spot in it. In this letter, we present a conceptual method
by which energy from carbon dioxide ($ CO_2 $) laser could be coupled to heat
up ions produced in situ in the plasma, which in turn produces the required hot
spot. An efficient conversion of $ CO_2 $ energy into ion beam energy can thus
give us the required source of energy for the fast ignition laser fusion. We
demonstrate by using PIC (Particle - In - Cell) simulations that the use of
several Kilo Tesla of an external magnetic field in the transverse direction in
an inhomogeneous plasma where a cutoff is followed by a resonance can lead to
coupling of laser energy to a lower hybrid ion plasma resonance. Then ions are
accelerated efficiently ($\sim 1 MeV$) by the breaking of lower hybrid waves

However, learning modern CNNs with manifold structures has not raised due
attention, mainly because of the inconvenience of imposing manifold structures
onto the architecture of the CNNs. In this paper we present ManifoldNet, a
novel method to encourage learning of manifold-aware representations. Our
approach segments the input manifold into a set of fragments. By assigning the
corresponding segmentation id as a pseudo label to every sample, we convert the
problem of preserving the local manifold structure into a point-wise
classification task. Due to its unsupervised nature, the segmentation tends to
be noisy. We mitigate this by introducing ensemble manifold segmentation (EMS).
EMS accounts for the manifold structure by dividing the training data into an
ensemble of classification training sets that contain samples of local
proximity. CNNs are trained on these ensembles under a multi-task learning
framework to conform to the manifold. ManifoldNet can be trained with only the
pseudo labels or together with task-specific labels. We evaluate ManifoldNet on
two different tasks: network imitation (distillation) and semi-supervised
learning. Our experiments show that the manifold structures are effectively
utilized for both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning.

two active particles as a simple, paradigmatic case for demonstrating that in
the presence of other particles or boundaries the behavior of chemically active
colloids may be \textit{qualitatively} different, even in the far field, from
the one exhibited by the corresponding ""effective squirmer"", obtained from the
mapping in an unbounded fluid. This emphasizes that understanding the
collective behavior and the dynamics under geometrical confinement of
chemically active particles necessarily requires to explicitly account for the
dependence of the hydrodynamic interactions on the distribution of chemical
species resulting from the activity of the particles.

precoder based multiuser downlink (DL) system performance and compare it with
the corresponding performance of more ordinary zero-forcing (ZF) spatial
precoder. We specifically also analyze how realistic highly nonlinear power
amplifiers (PAs) affect the achievable DL performance, as the individual PA
units in large-array or massive MIMO systems are expected to be small, cheap
and operating close to saturation for increased energy-efficiency purposes. It
is shown that the largely reduced peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the PA
input signals in the CE precoder based system allows for pushing the PA units
harsher towards saturation, while allowing to reach higher
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINRs) at the intended receivers
compared to the classical ZF precoder based system. The obtained results
indicate that the CE precoder can outperform the ZF precoder by up to 5-6 dBs,
in terms of the achievable SINRs, when the PA units are pushed towards their
saturating region. Such large gains are a substantial benefit when seeking to
improve the spectral and energy-efficiencies of the mobile cellular networks.

applied to both planar thin-film and nanostructured single-junction solar

quantum luminescence efficiency, parasitic reabsorption, and on photon escape
probabilities of reemmited photons. While the internal quantum luminescence
efficiency is an intrinsic material property, both latter quantities can be
determined rigorously for an arbitrary solar cell architecture by
three-dimensional electrodynamic dipole emission calculations. We demonstrate
the strengths and validity of our framework by determining the impact of photon
recycling on the $V_{\mathrm{oc}}$ of a conventional planar organo-metal halide
perovskite thin-film solar cell and compare it to established reference cases
with perfect antireflection and Lambertian light scattering. Our calculations
reveal $\Delta V^{\mathrm{PR}}_{\mathrm{oc}}$ values of up to 80 mV for the
considered device stack in the absence of angular restriction and up to 240 mV
when the escape cone above the cell is restricted to
$\theta_{\mathrm{out}}=2.5^\circ$ around the cell normal. These improvements
impose severe constraints on the parasitic absorption as a parasitic
reabsorption probability of only 2\% reduces the $\Delta

coalescence of two neutron stars marks the beginning of multi-messenger

gravitational waveform models is a crucial prerequisite to extract information
about the properties of the binary system that generated a detected GW signal.
In binary neutron star systems (BNS), tidal effects also need to be
incorporated in the modeling for an accurate waveform representation. Building
on previous work [Phys.Rev.D96 121501], we explore the performance of
inspiral-merger waveform models that are obtained by adding a numerical
relativity (NR) based approximant for the tidal part of the phasing (NRTidal)
to existing models for nonprecessing and precessing binary black hole systems
(SEOBNRv4, PhenomD and PhenomPv2), as implemented in the LSC Algorithm Library
Suite. The resulting BNS waveforms are compared and contrasted to target
waveforms hybridizing NR waveforms, covering the last approx. 10 orbits up to
merger and extending through the postmerger phase, with inspiral waveforms
calculated from 30Hz obtained with TEOBResumS. The latter is a state-of-the-art
effective-one-body waveform model that blends together tidal and spin effects.
We probe that the combination of the PN-based self-spin terms and of the
NRTidal description is necessary to obtain minimal mismatches (< 0.01) and
phase differences (< 1 rad) with respect to the target waveforms. However, we
also discuss possible improvements and drawbacks of the NRTidal approximant in
its current form, since we find that it tends to overestimate the tidal
interaction with respect to the TEOBResumS model during the inspiral.

consumption, including both propulsion energy and communication related energy,
while satisfying the communication throughput requirement of each GN. To this
end, we first derive an analytical propulsion power consumption model for
rotary-wing UAVs, and then formulate the energy minimization problem by jointly
optimizing the UAV trajectory and communication time allocation among GNs, as
well as the total mission completion time. The problem is difficult to be
optimally solved, as it is non-convex and involves infinitely many variables
over time. To tackle this problem, we first consider the simple
fly-hover-communicate design, where the UAV successively visits a set of
hovering locations and communicates with one corresponding GN when hovering at
each location. For this design, we propose an efficient algorithm to optimize
the hovering locations and durations, as well as the flying trajectory
connecting these hovering locations, by leveraging the travelling salesman
problem (TSP) and convex optimization techniques. Next, we consider the general
case where the UAV communicates also when flying. We propose a new path
discretization method to transform the original problem into a discretized
equivalent with a finite number of optimization variables, for which we obtain
a locally optimal solution by applying the successive convex approximation
(SCA) technique. Numerical results show the significant performance gains of
the proposed designs over benchmark schemes, in achieving energy-efficient
communication with rotary-wing UAVs.

the frequency of incident waves. Since real ocean waves are non-stationary by
nature and not defined by a single frequency component, the PTO can be either
tuned at a constant frequency characterized by the local spectrum, or
continuously tuned to a representative wave frequency. In either case, a
time-frequency representation of the waves is expected since the wave profile
changes over time. This paper discusses about the PTO tuning problem for
passive and reactive controllers, in real waves, by comparing different methods
for time-varying frequency estimation: the extended Kalman filter (EKF),
frequency-locked loop (FLL), and Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). The aim is to
verify the impact of such methods on the absorbed and reactive powers, and the
PTO rating. It is shown that the mean estimated frequency of the EKF, and FLL,
converges respectively to the mean centroid frequency, and energy frequency, of
the excitation force spectrum. Moreover, the HHT mean frequency has no
correlation with the spectral statistical properties. A comparison of the
energy absorbed shows that up to 37% more energy is obtained with the HHT over
the other estimation methods. Numerical simulations are performed with sea

a small portion of nomadic agents that widely traverse belief space can disrupt
a larger population of stampeding agents. Extending the model, we introduce the
concept of Adversarial Herding, where bad actors can exploit properties of
technologically mediated communication to artificially create self sustaining
runaway polarization. We call this condition the Pishkin Effect as it recalls
the large scale buffalo stampedes that could be created by native Americans
hunters. We then discuss opportunities for system design that could leverage
the ability to recognize these negative patterns, and discuss affordances that
may disrupt the formation of natural and deliberate echo chambers.

(KV), using experiments and mathematical modeling. During development,
monociliated cells that comprise the KV undergo region-specific shape changes
along the anterior-posterior axis that are critical for KV function: anterior
cells become long and thin, while posterior cells become short and squat. Here,
we develop a mathematical vertex-like model for cell shapes, which incorporates
both tissue rheology and cell motility, and constrain the model parameters
using previously published rheological data for the zebrafish tailbud [Serwane
et al.] as well as our own measurements of the KV speed. We find that drag
forces due to dynamics of cells surrounding the KV could be sufficient to drive
KV cell shape changes during KV development. More broadly, these results
suggest that cell shape changes could be driven by dynamic forces not typically
considered in models or experiments.

improper learnable by DNNs in the sense that for any given function that can be
expressed as a function in MARS with $M$ parameters there exists a multilayer
neural network with $O(M \log (M/\varepsilon))$ parameters that approximates
this function up to sup-norm error $\varepsilon.$ We show a similar result for
expansions with respect to the Faber-Schauder system. Based on this, we derive
risk comparison inequalities that bound the statistical risk of fitting a

deep networks perform better or only slightly worse than the considered spline

nearest-neighbour separations of the fragments at all scales are within a
factor of 2 of the Jeans' length at that scale. However, the relationship
between the mean densities of the fragments and their separations is
significantly shallower than expected for Jeans' fragmentation. The
relationship is similar to the one predicted for a filament that exhibits a
Larson-like scaling between size-scale and velocity dispersion; such a scaling
may result from turbulent support. Based on the number of YSOs in Nessie, we
estimate that the star formation rate is $\sim$ 371 M$_\odot$/Myr; similar
values result if using the number of dense cores, or the amount of dense gas,

dynamics of spacetime and the ensuing departures from classical General
Relativity. The main focus is on cosmological applications, particularly the
impact of quantum gravitational effects on the dynamics of a homogenous and
isotropic cosmological background. Our interest lies in the consequences for
the evolution of the early universe and singularity resolution, as well as in
the possibility of providing an alternative explanation for dark matter and
dark energy in the late universe.
  The thesis is divided into two main parts, dedicated to alternative (and
complementary) ways of tackling the problem of Quantum Gravity. The first part
is concerned with cosmological applications of background independent
approaches to Quantum Gravity, both in the context of loop quantisation and in
quantum geometrodynamics. Particularly relevant in this work is the Group Field
Theory approach, which we use to study the effective dynamics of the emergent
universe from a full theory of Quantum Gravity (i.e. without symmetry
reduction).
  In the second part, modified gravity theories are introduced as tools to
provide an effective description of quantum gravitational effects, e.g. by
introducing new degrees of freedom and symmetries. Particularly relevant in
this respect is local conformal invariance, which finds a natural realisation
in the framework of Weyl geometry. We build a modified theory of gravity based
on such symmetry principle, and argue that new fields in the extended
gravitational sector may play the role of dark matter. New degrees of freedom
are also natural in models with varying fundamental `constants', which we
examine critically.
  Finally, we discuss prospects for future work and point at directions for the
derivation of realistic cosmological models from Quantum Gravity candidates.

detector for this model is approximated using two frameworks, namely factor
graphs (FGs) combined with the sum-product algorithm (SPA), and a variational
Bayesian (VB) inference method. The resulting pilot-aided algorithms perform
iterative phase-noise compensation in cooperation with a decoder, using
extended Kalman smoothing to estimate the a posteriori phase-noise distribution
jointly for all channels. The system model and the proposed algorithms are
verified using experimental data obtained from space-division multiplexed
multicore-fiber transmission. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the algorithms
are further evaluated in terms of phase-noise tolerance for coded transmission.
It is observed that they significantly outperform the conventional approach to
phase-noise compensation in the optical literature. Moreover, the FG/SPA
framework performs similarly or better than the VB framework in terms of
phase-noise tolerance of the resulting algorithms, for a slightly higher
computational complexity.

flow-induced asymmetric distortion of the corotation region and the evolving
vortensity contrast between the librating horseshoe material and background
disc flow. Using simulations of laminar torqued discs containing migrating
planets, we demonstrate the existence of the four distinct migration regimes
predicted in Paper I. In two regimes, the migration is approximately locked to
the inward or outward radial gas flow, and in the other regimes the planet
undergoes outward runaway migration that eventually settles to fast steady
migration. In addition, we demonstrate torque and migration reversals induced
by midplane magnetic stresses, with a bifurcation dependent on the disc surface
density. We develop a model for fast migration, and show why the outward
runaway saturates to a steady speed, and examine phenomenologically its
termination due to changing local disc conditions. We also develop an
analytical model for the corotation torque at late times that includes
viscosity, for application to discs that sustain modest turbulence. Finally, we
use the simulation results to develop torque prescriptions for inclusion in
population synthesis models of planet formation.

(non-LTE effects): in warmer stars ($T_{\text{eff}}\approx6500$K) the inner
wings tend to be weaker in non-LTE models, while at lower effective
temperatures ($T_{\text{eff}}\approx4500$K) the inner wings can be stronger in
non-LTE models; the non-LTE effects are more severe at lower metallicities. We
test our 3D non-LTE models against observations of well-studied benchmark
stars. For the Sun, we infer concordant effective temperatures from H$\alpha$,
H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$; however the value is too low by around 50K which could
signal residual modelling shortcomings. For other benchmark stars, our 3D
non-LTE models generally reproduce the effective temperatures to within
$1\sigma$ uncertainties. For H$\alpha$, the absolute 3D effects and non-LTE
effects can separately reach around 100K, in terms of inferred effective
temperatures. For metal-poor turn-off stars, 1D LTE models of H$\alpha$ can
underestimate effective temperatures by around 150K. Our 3D non-LTE model
spectra are publicly available, and can be used for more reliable spectroscopic
effective temperature determinations.

subsystems of computing systems, is to use channel codes that reduce the power
needed to send bits on a channel in exchange for bounded errors and erasures on
numeric program values---value-deviation-bounded (VDB) codes. Unlike rate
distortion codes, which guarantee a bound on the expected value of channel
distortion, the probabilistic VDB codes we present guarantee any desired tail
distribution on integer distances of words transmitted over a channel. We
extend prior work to present tighter upper bounds on the efficiency for VDB
codes. We present a new probabilistic VDB encoder that lowers power dissipation
in exchange for bounded channel integer distortions. The code we present takes
the peculiar approach of changing the channel bit error rate across the ordinal
bit positions in a word to reduce power dissipation. We implement the code
table generator in a software tool built on the dReal SMT solver and we

  280 Characters","To appear in the Proceedings of AAAI ICWSM 2018",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is often said that constraints affect creative production, both in terms
of form and quality. Online social media platforms frequently impose
constraints on the content that users can produce, limiting the range of
possible contributions. Do these restrictions tend to push creators towards
producing more or less successful content? How do creators adapt their
contributions to fit the limits imposed by social media platforms? To answer
these questions, we conduct an observational study of a recent event: on
November 7, 2017, Twitter changed the maximum allowable length of a tweet from
140 to 280 characters, thereby significantly altering its signature constraint.
In the first study of this switch, we compare tweets with nearly or exactly 140
characters before the change to tweets of the same length posted after the
change. This setup enables us to characterize how users alter their tweets to
fit the constraint and how this affects their tweets' success. We find that in
response to a length constraint, users write more tersely, use more
abbreviations and contracted forms, and use fewer definite articles. Also,
although in general tweet success increases with length, we find initial
evidence that tweets made to fit the 140-character constraint tend to be more
successful than similar-length tweets written when the constraint was removed,
suggesting that the length constraint improved tweet quality.

characteristics of CMEs imaged in the heliosphere by the inner (HI-1) cameras.
More specifically, in this paper we present distributions of the basic
observational parameters - namely occurrence frequency, central position angle
(PA) and PA span - derived from nearly 2000 detections of CMEs in the
heliosphere by HI-1 on STEREO-A or STEREO-B from the minimum between Solar

further 158 CME detections from the descending phase of Cycle 24, by which time
communication with STEREO-B had been lost. We compare heliospheric CME
characteristics with properties of CMEs observed at coronal altitudes, and with
sunspot number. As expected, heliospheric CME rates correlate with sunspot
number, and are not inconsistent with coronal rates once instrumental
factors/differences in cataloguing philosophy are considered. As well as being
more abundant, heliospheric CMEs, like their coronal counterparts, tend to be
wider during solar maximum. Our results confirm previous coronagraph analyses
suggesting that CME launch sites don't simply migrate to higher latitudes with
increasing solar activity. At solar minimum, CMEs tend to be launched from
equatorial latitudes while, at maximum, CMEs appear to be launched over a much
wider latitude range; this has implications for understanding the CME/solar
source association. Our analysis provides some supporting evidence for the
systematic dragging of CMEs to lower latitude as they propagate outwards.

(QFF). The tool uses quantum walks as a means to quadratically fast-forward a
reversible Markov chain. More specifically, with $P$ the Markov chain
transition matrix and $D = \sqrt{P\circ P^T}$ its discriminant matrix ($D=P$ if
$P$ is symmetric), we construct a quantum walk algorithm that for any quantum
state $|v\rangle$ and integer $t$ returns a quantum state $\epsilon$-close to
the state $D^t|v\rangle/\|D^t|v\rangle\|$. The algorithm uses
$O\Big(\|D^t|v\rangle\|^{-1}\sqrt{t\log(\epsilon\|D^t|v\rangle\|)^{-1}}\Big)$
expected quantum walk steps and $O(\|D^t|v\rangle\|^{-1})$ expected reflections
around $|v\rangle$. This shows that quantum walks can accelerate the transient
dynamics of Markov chains, complementing the line of results that proves the
acceleration of their limit behavior.
  We show that this tool leads to speedups on random walk algorithms in a very
natural way. Specifically we consider random walk algorithms for testing the
graph expansion and clusterability, and show that we can quadratically improve
the dependency of the classical property testers on the random walk runtime.
Moreover, our quantum algorithm exponentially improves the space complexity of
the classical tester to logarithmic. As a subroutine of independent interest,
we use QFF for determining whether a given pair of nodes lies in the same
cluster or in separate clusters. This solves a robust version of $s$-$t$
connectivity, relevant in a learning context for classifying objects among a
set of examples. The different algorithms crucially rely on the quantum speedup
of the transient behavior of random walks.

Cosmic Rays (CRs) is a prime objective towards the resolution of the
long-standing enigma of CRs. We report on a compelling similarity of the energy
and radial distributions of multi-TeV CRs extracted from observations of very
high energy (VHE) $\gamma$-rays towards the Galactic Center (GC) and two
prominent clusters of young massive stars, Cyg~OB2 and Westerlund~1. This
resemblance we interpret as a hint that CRs responsible for the diffuse VHE
$\gamma$-ray emission from the GC are accelerated by the ultracompact stellar
clusters located in the heart of GC. The derived $1/r$ decrement of the CR
density with the distance from a star cluster is a distinct signature of
continuous, over a few million years, CR injection into the interstellar
medium. The lack of brightening of the $\gamma$-ray images toward the stellar
clusters excludes the leptonic origin of $\gamma$-radiation. The hard, $\propto
E^{-2.3}$ type power-law energy spectra of parent protons continues up to
$\sim$ 1 PeV. The efficiency of conversion of kinetic energy of stellar winds
to CRs can be as high as 10 percent implying that the young massive stars may
operate as proton PeVatrons with a dominant contribution to the flux of highest
energy galactic CRs.

part of travel demand analysis and transportation planning. With the advent of
ubiquitous GPS-enabled devices (e.g., a smartphone), a cost-effective approach
for inferring commuters' mobility mode(s) is to leverage their GPS
trajectories. A majority of studies have proposed mode inference models based
on hand-crafted features and traditional machine learning algorithms. However,
manual features engender some major drawbacks including vulnerability to
traffic and environmental conditions as well as possessing human's bias in
creating efficient features. One way to overcome these issues is by utilizing
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) schemes that are capable of automatically
driving high-level features from the raw input. Accordingly, in this paper, we
take advantage of CNN architectures so as to predict travel modes based on only
raw GPS trajectories, where the modes are labeled as walk, bike, bus, driving,
and train. Our key contribution is designing the layout of the CNN's input
layer in such a way that not only is adaptable with the CNN schemes but
represents fundamental motion characteristics of a moving object including
speed, acceleration, jerk, and bearing rate. Furthermore, we ameliorate the
quality of GPS logs through several data preprocessing steps. Using the clean
input layer, a variety of CNN configurations are evaluated to achieve the best
CNN architecture. The highest accuracy of 84.8% has been achieved through the
ensemble of the best CNN configuration. In this research, we contrast our
methodology with traditional machine learning algorithms as well as the seminal
and most related studies to demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

condensations which are sufficiently dense that gravitational collapse converts
a large fraction of their mass into a star or small clutch of stars. In nearby
star-formation regions, the core mass function (CMF) is strikingly similar to
the IMF, suggesting that the shape of the IMF may simply be inherited from the
CMF. Here we present 1.3 mm observations, obtained with ALMA, the world's

be more representative of the Galactic-disk regions where most stars form. The

(BS) finds a vacant channel, it can transmit for up to 20 ms and turn OFF its
transmission for only 1 ms, resulting in a maximum duty cycle of 95%. In a
dense deployment of LTE-U and Wi-Fi, it is very likely that a Wi-Fi access
point (AP) will wish to use the same channel. It will start transmission by
trying to transmit association packets (using carrier sense multiple access
with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)) through the 1 ms LTE-U OFF duration. Since
this duration is very small, it leads to increased association packet drops and
thus delays the Wi-Fi association process. Once LTE-U, using CSAT, detects
Wi-Fi, it should scale back the duty cycle to 50%. We demonstrate in this
paper, using an experimental platform as well as theoretical analysis, that if
LTE-U is using a 95% duty cycle, energy based CSAT will take a much longer time
to scale back the duty cycle due to the beacon drops and delays in the
reception. Hence, in order to maintain association fairness with Wi-Fi, we
propose that a LTE-U BS should not transmit at maximum duty cycles (95%), even

3D positions of each of the robot joints. Learning is done by using a
multi-objective convolutional neural network with four previously mentioned
objectives simultaneously using a combined loss function. The multi-objective
approach makes the system more flexible and efficient by reusing some of the
same features and diversifying for each objective in lower layers. A fully

because of their usefulness in the analysis of responses determined by
non-linear relationships with multivariate predictors. In this kind of
statistical models, the response depends linearly on unknown functions of
predictor variables and typically, the goal of the analysis is to make
inference about these functions.
  In this paper, we study the problem of additive regression using a least
squares approach based on periodic orthogonal wavelets on the interval [0,1].
For this estimator, we obtain strong consistency (with respect to the
$\mathbb{L}_{2}$ norm) characterized by optimal convergence rates up to a
logarithmic factor, independent of the dimensionality of the problem. This is
achieved by truncating the model estimates by a properly chosen parameter, and
selecting the multiresolution level $J$ used for the wavelet expansion, as a
function of the sample size. In this approach, we obtain these results without
the assumption of an equispaced design, a condition that is typically assumed
in most wavelet-based procedures.
  Finally, we show practical results obtained from a simulation study and a
real life application, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed methods
for the problem of non-linear robust additive regression models.

eigenvalue problem, we show that eigenvalue degeneracies are always coincident
with eigenvector degeneracies, so that all eigenvalue degeneracies are

discuss in some detail the fact that EPDs define branch points (BPs) in the
complex-frequency plane; we provide simple formulas for these points, and show
that parity-time (PT) symmetry leads to real-valued EPDs occurring on the
real-frequency axis. We discuss the connection of the linear algebra approach
to previous waveguide analysis based on singular points from bifurcation
theory, which provides a complementary viewpoint of EPD phenomena, showing that
EPDs are singular points of the dispersion function associated with the fold
bifurcation. This provides an important connection of various modal interaction
phenomena known in guided-wave structures with recent interesting effects

development methods able to assess the seismic energy propagation on the

of the source and it is affected by the attenuation and the scattering effects
along the path. Thus, the effect of the earthquake is the result of a complex
interaction between the signal emitted by the source and the propagation
effects. The purpose of this work is to develop a methodology able to reproduce
the propagation law of seismic energy, hypothesizing the ""transmission""
mechanisms that preside over the distribution of seismic effects on the
territory, by means of a structural optimization process with a predetermined
energy distribution. Briefly, the approach, based on a deterministic physical
model, determines an objective correction of the detected distributions of
seismic intensity on the soil, forcing the compatibility of the observed data
with the physical-mechanical model. It is based on two hypotheses: (1) the
earthquake at the epicentre is simulated by means of a system of distortions
split into three parameters; (2) the intensity is considered coincident to the
density of elastic energy. The optimal distribution of the beams stiffness is
achieved, by reducing the difference between the values of intensity

differences between the different cosmological models become more pronouced in
a photon time-of-fligth $t_s$ vs. $z$ repr\'esentation, he also noted that the
best equation to account for observations may also be written $z =

compare the theoretical Hubble diagram obtained with the flat $\Lambda CDM$
model to the ones we have obtained few years ago [3, 4, 5] from a model that we
call here the ""light model"" for the sake of clarity. Our conclusions are that
values calculated on the basis of the $\Lambda CDM$ model exhibit poor
agreement with the presently available data while the light model agrees
exactly with observations and conclusions of statistical studies [1] and [2]

also quantized for coherent cooperative transmission. Based on the imperfect
CSI, we aim for optimizing the beamforming vectors in order to minimize the
total transmit power subject to users' rate requirements and fronthaul capacity
constraints. We derive the closed-form expression of the achievable data rate
by exploiting the statistical properties of multiple uncertain terms. Then, we

  Geographical Information Systems (SIGSPATIAL'16)",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a large collection of urban datasets, how can we find their hidden
correlations? For example, New York City (NYC) provides open access to taxi
data from year 2012 to 2015 with about half million taxi trips generated per
day. In the meantime, we have a rich set of urban data in NYC including
points-of-interest (POIs), geo-tagged tweets, weather, vehicle collisions, etc.
Is it possible that these ubiquitous datasets can be used to explain the city
traffic? Understanding the hidden correlation between external data and traffic
data would allow us to answer many important questions in urban computing such
as: If we observe a high traffic volume at Madison Square Garden (MSG) in NYC,
is it because of the regular peak hour or a big event being held at MSG? If a
disaster weather such as a hurricane or a snow storm hits the city, how would
the traffic be affected?
  While existing studies may utilize external datasets for prediction task,
they do not explicitly seek for direct explanations from the external datasets.
In this paper, we present our results in attempts to understand taxi traffic
dynamics in NYC from multiple external data sources. We use four real-world
ubiquitous urban datasets, including POI, weather, geo-tagged tweet, and
collision records. To address the heterogeneity of ubiquitous urban data, we
present carefully-designed feature representations for various datasets.
Extensive experiments on real data demonstrate the explanatory power on taxi

that POIs can well describe the regular traffic patterns. At the same time,
geo-tagged tweets can explain irregular traffic caused by big events and
weather can explain the abnormal traffic drop.

the sharing economy. Used by passengers and drivers extensive, it becomes
increasingly important for the car-hailing service providers to minimize the
waiting time of passengers and optimize the vehicle utilization, thus to
improve the overall user experience. Therefore, the supply-demand estimation is
an indispensable ingredient of an efficient online car-hailing service. To
improve the accuracy of the estimation results, we analyze the implicit
relationships between the points of Interest (POI) and the supply-demand gap in
this paper. The different categories of POIs have positive or negative effects
on the estimation, we propose a POI selection scheme and incorporate it into
XGBoost [1] to achieve more accurate estimation results. Our experiment
demonstrates our method provides more accurate estimation results and more
stable estimation results than the existing methods.

communicates by performing the pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), binary phase

approach (different from those applied before) is given. A basic problem under
consideration arises in viscous incompressible fluid dynamics and describes
self-similar solutions to the boundary layer equation for a stream function
with zero pressure gradient (connected with the plane-parallel laminar flow in
a mixing layer). Some previous results concerning singular nonlinear Cauchy
problems, smooth stable initial manifolds, and parametric exponential Lyapunov
series are used to state correctly and analyze the singular
""initial-boundary-value"" problem for a third-order nonlinear ordinary
differential equation defined on the entire real axis. The detailed analysis of
this singular nonlinear problem leads, in particular, to efficient methods for
solving it approximately and gives a possibility to obtain numerically the
particle trajectories in the plane of flow. Some results of the numerical
experiments are displayed and their physical interpretation is discussed. A
connection of this basic problem with some known physical and mathematical
problems, arising for self-similar solutions to the boundary layer equations
with zero pressure gradient, is described, namely the ""flooded jet"", the plane
""semi-jet"" and the ""near-wall jet"" problems are considered which are of
interest by themselves.

Bayesian Analysis Reveals Evidence Against Micro-Psychokinesis', published in
Frontiers of Psychology in March 2018, reports on a mind-matter experiment with
the main result of strong evidence against Micro-Psychokinesis. Despite this
conclusion, the authors interpret the observed pattern in their data as
possible evidence for Micro-Psychokinesis, albeit of a different kind.
Suggesting a connection to some existing models, the authors put forward the
hypothesis that a higher frequency of slow data variations can be observed in
their experiment data than in a set of control data. This commentary analyses
this claim and concludes that the variation in the data motivating this
hypothesis would show up just by chance with a probability of p=0.328 under a
null hypothesis. Therefore, there is no evidence for the hypothesis of faster
data variations, and thus for this kind of suggested Micro-Psychokinesis in
this experiment.

solar photographs taken from Florence with a Roster tele-objective. The main
characteristics of the three photographs are: (i) Date: 21st April 1893. Time:
5:15 p.m. Magnification: 61x. (ii) Date: 25th April 1893. Time: 4:40 p.m.
Magnification: 68x. (iii) Date: 30th April 1893. Time: 17:00 p.m.
Magnification: 71x. It may be interesting to note that, although there are
drawings of the solar disc in the collection of the Kalocsa Observatory for the
days 21 and 30, there is no such thing for day 25. Thus, Roster's photographs
fill that gap in the graphical information of the Sun.

effect of light, is also a spin-dependent shift of the centroid of light beam's
intensity (energy flux), but it is a purely geometric effect that does not
depend on a particular light-matter interaction. In this paper, we discuss the
GSHEL with respect to momentum instead of energy flux, and find out that in the
case of the symmetric energy-momentum tensor, the shift of the centroid of
momentum flux is double that of energy flux. Interestingly, for the canonical
energy-momentum tensor, the centroid shift of momentum flux agrees with that of
energy flux. If we consider the effect of orbital angular momentum, however,
the centroid displacement of momentum flux is twice that of energy flux for
both energy-momentum tensors. To tell which energy-momentum tensor of light
field would be more ""correct"", we propose a experimental scheme to test the
GSHEL of momentum flux through the mechanical effect of light.

time-periodic modulation of the stiffness of a one-dimensional elastic
waveguide. Time modulation produces flat dispersion bands at frequencies that
are multiple integers of half the modulation frequency. These flat bands lead
to the selective reflection of a broadband incident wave at the interface
between a non-modulated medium, and one with time-modulated stiffness
properties. This results from the vanishing group velocity at the flat band
frequencies, which prevents their propagation into the modulated domain. Thus,
the considered modulated waveguide is understood as a single port system, in
which a broadband incident wave (input) results in a narrowband reflected wave
(output) at a frequency defined by modulation. The appearance of the flat bands
for a time-modulated waveguide is here illustrated analytically and through
numerical simulations. The filtering characteristics of a
non-modulate/modulated interface are observed experimentally by implementing a
square-wave modulation scheme that employs an array of piezoelectric patches
bonded to an elastic waveguide subject to transverse motion. The patches are
shunted through a negative electrical capaticance that, when connected,
implements a stiffness reduction for the resulting electromechanical waveguide.
Switching the capacitance on and off effectively modulates the stiffness of the
waveguide, and illustrates the filtering characteristics associated with
time-modulation of the equivalent elastic properties. We envision that a
similar approach could be extended to investigate other properties of
time-modulated elastic metamaterials, such as non-reciprocity and one-way
filtering of elastic waves.
