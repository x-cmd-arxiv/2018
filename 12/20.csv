disease from high-dimensional and heterogeneous data remains a key challenge in
transforming healthcare. In the last few years, both supervised and
unsupervised deep learning achieved promising results in the area of medical
imaging and image analysis. Unlike supervised learning which is biased towards
how it is being supervised and manual efforts to create class label for the
algorithm, unsupervised learning derive insights directly from the data itself,
group the data and help to make data driven decisions without any external
bias. This review systematically presents various unsupervised models applied
to medical image analysis, including autoencoders and its several variants,
Restricted Boltzmann machines, Deep belief networks, Deep Boltzmann machine and
Generative adversarial network. Future research opportunities and challenges of
unsupervised techniques for medical image analysis have also been discussed.

consequences. It appears in different forms, and in most of the social
networks, it is in textual format. Automatic detection of such incidents
requires intelligent systems. Most of the existing studies have approached this
problem with conventional machine learning models and the majority of the
developed models in these studies are adaptable to a single social network at a
time. In recent studies, deep learning based models have found their way in the
detection of cyberbullying incidents, claiming that they can overcome the
limitations of the conventional models, and improve the detection performance.
In this paper, we investigate the findings of a recent literature in this
regard. We successfully reproduced the findings of this literature and
validated their findings using the same datasets, namely Wikipedia, Twitter,
and Formspring, used by the authors. Then we expanded our work by applying the
developed methods on a new YouTube dataset (~54k posts by ~4k users) and
investigated the performance of the models in new social media platforms. We
also transferred and evaluated the performance of the models trained on one
platform to another platform. Our findings show that the deep learning based
models outperform the machine learning models previously applied to the same
YouTube dataset. We believe that the deep learning based models can also
benefit from integrating other sources of information and looking into the
impact of profile information of the users in social networks.

introduces a novel Synchronous Flooding (SF) architecture capable of
dynamically configuring SF protocols to satisfy complex SDN control

tree-child networks, we show that the converse of the above statement holds,
thereby showing that {\sc Network Containment}, the problem of checking whether
a network is contained in another, can be solved in linear time for tree-child

fingerprinting (UTE-MRF) method that can simultaneously quantify tissue
relaxometries for muscle and bone in musculoskeletal systems and tissue
components in brain and therefore can synthesize pseudo-CT images.
  Methods: A FISP-MRF sequence with half pulse excitation and half spoke radial
acquisition was designed to sample fast T2 decay signals. Sinusoidal echo time
(TE) pattern was applied to enhance MRF sensitivity for tissues with short and
ultrashort T2 values. The performance of UTE-MRF was evaluated via simulations,
phantoms, and in vivo experiments.
  Results: A minimal TE of 0.05 ms was achieved in UTE-MRF. Simulations
indicated that extension of TE sampling increased T2 quantification accuracy in
cortical bone and tendon, and had little impact on long T2 muscle
quantifications. For a rubber phantom, an average T1/T2 of 162/1.07 ms from
UTE-MRF were compared well with gold standard T2 of 190 ms from IR-UTE and T2*
of 1.03 ms from UTE sequence. For a long T2 agarose phantom, the linear
regression slope between UTE-MRF and gold standard was 1.07 (R2=0.991) for T1
and 1.04 (R2=0.994) for T2. In vivo experiments showed the detection of
cortical bone and Achilles tendon, where the averaged T2 was respectively 1.0
ms and 15 ms. Scalp images were in good agreement with CT.
  Conclusion: UTE-MRF with sinusoidal TE variations shows its capability to
produce pseudo-CT images and simultaneously output T1, T2, proton density, and
B0 maps for tissues with long T2 and short/ultrashort T2 in the brain and
musculoskeletal system.

receives contributions both from the fusion of weak vector bosons (VBF) and
from QCD processes, especially gluon fusion (GF). The former process is
important for measuring the coupling of the Higgs boson to weak bosons, whereas
the latter process plays an important role in determining any $CP$-admixtures
in the Higgs sector. In this paper we go beyond the current state-of-the-art
for fixed order calculations of the GF process (i.e. one loop $H+2j$ including
full quark mass effects) by including the all-order effects in leading
$\log(\hat s/p_t^2)$, together with full quark mass and loop-propagator
kinematic effects. We calculate the mass-dependent components and implement the
resummation within the framework of High Energy Jets.
  The high energy effects suppress the prediction compared to fixed order at
large $\Delta y_{12}$ and $m_{jj}$ (and therefore within the usual VBF cuts of
widely separated jets), just as found in the limit of $m_t\to \infty$. The mass
dependence is more significant than at fixed order, because the systematic
inclusion of the leading logarithms in $\hat s/p_t^2$ results in a hardening of
the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson, which in turn probes in more detail
the loop-structure of the coupling. In particular, the full mass dependence
reduces the cross section within VBF cuts by 11\% compared to a calculation
based just on the infinite top mass limit, but the impact of the bottom quark
remains small. This all implies that the gluon-fusion contribution within
VBF-cuts is less severe than current estimates suggest.

from this class is chosen by the code generator through an autotuning approach.
The implementation is done within the open source PDE software framework Dune

approach is illustrated with performance measurements for DG schemes for a
scalar diffusion reaction equation and the Stokes equation. In our
measurements, we utilize both the AVX2 and the AVX512 instruction set,

proximal MEC servers for faster task computation. However, current MEC system
design is based on average-based metrics, which fails to account for the
ultra-reliable low-latency requirements in mission-critical applications. To
tackle this, this paper proposes a new system design, where probabilistic and
statistical constraints are imposed on task queue lengths, by applying extreme
value theory. The aim is to minimize users' power consumption while trading off
the allocated resources for local computation and task offloading. Due to
wireless channel dynamics, users are re-associated to MEC servers in order to
offload tasks using higher rates or accessing proximal servers. In this regard,
a user-server association policy is proposed, taking into account the channel
quality as well as the servers' computation capabilities and workloads. By
marrying tools from Lyapunov optimization and matching theory, a two-timescale
mechanism is proposed, where a user-server association is solved in the long
timescale while a dynamic task offloading and resource allocation policy is
executed in the short timescale. Simulation results corroborate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach by guaranteeing highly-reliable task
computation and lower delay performance, compared to several baselines.

were initially thought to be an oxymoron since only AGB stars dredge carbon
into their atmospheres. Mass transfer from a former AGB companion that has
since faded to a white dwarf seems the most likely explanation. Indeed, a few
types of giants known to show anomalous abundances --- notably, the CH, Ba and
CEMP-s stars --- are known to have a high binary frequency. The dC stars may be
the enhanced-abundance progenitors of most, if not all, of these systems, but
this requires demonstrating a high binary frequency for dCs. Here, for a sample
of 240 dC stars targeted for repeat spectroscopy by the SDSS-IV's Time Domain
Spectroscopic Survey, we analyze radial velocity variability to constrain the
binary frequency and orbital properties. A handful of dC systems show large
velocity variability ($>$100 km s$^{-1}$). We compare the dCs to a control
sample with a similar distribution of magnitude, color, proper motion, and
parallax. Using MCMC methods, we use the measured $\Delta$RV distribution to
estimate the binary fraction and the separation distribution assuming both a
unimodal and bimodal distribution. We find the dC stars have an enhanced binary
fraction of 95\%, consistent with them being products of mass transfer. These
models result in mean separations of less than 1 AU corresponding to periods on
the order of 1 year. Our results support the conclusion that dC stars form from
close binary systems via mass transfer.

overcome the exclusion of two-dimensional ferro-magnetism expected from the
Mermin-Wagner theorem. SOC and the resulting emergent interfacial spin-orbit

detection. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that an all-epitaxial
ferromagnet/MgO/metal junction with only a negligible MR anisotropy undergoes a
remarkable transformation below the superconducting transition temperature of

MR anisotropy and supports the formation of spin-triplet superconductivity,

material form the surroundings of the TDGs. The inclusion of the tidal arm in
the simulation of TDGs results in roughly a doubling of the gas mass

mass by a factor of 1.5 and a $\sim3$ times higher star formation rate (SFR)

is much reduced and consequently interactions become very relevant, providing a
new platform into the physics of two-dimensional correlated materials. Evidence
of a proposed Mott insulating as well as superconducting state in these highly
tunable systems has spurred much attention as they could pave the way to
understanding long-standing questions of high-$T_c$ superconductivity or
provide candidate systems for topological chiral superconductors; key to highly
relevant quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate that twisted bilayer boron
nitride (TBBN) is an exciting and even richer alternative to twisted bilayer
graphene (TBG). Crucially, we show that in TBBN multiple flat bands emerge
without having to fine tuning close to a ""magic angle"" that upon doping lead to
correlated phases of matter (insulating and superconducting). TBBN could thus
be much less sensitive to small deviations in the twist angle and therefore
provide a particularly suited experimental platform to study correlation
physics in two dimensions. Furthermore, we find that in marked contrast to TBG

time, also the multiplicity dependence of direct photon production was
investigated in p--Pb collisions. Whereas in the small systems no significant
thermal photon signal was observed, a $\sim15\%$ excess has been measured in
central Pb--Pb collisions in the region of $p_{\rm T}<3$ GeV/$c$. A signal of
prompt photon production at high transverse momentum consistent with binary
scaling has been observed in all collision systems following NLO pQCD
predictions. Direct photon flow has been measured in central and semi-central
Pb--Pb collisions and found to be of similar size as the charged hadron and

and simulated particles typically remain near the correct trajectory. However,
it is only second order accurate. Therefore, in scenarios where it is not
enough to know that a particle stays on the right trajectory but one needs to
know where on the trajectory the particle is at a given time, Boris method
requires very small time steps to deliver accurate phase information, making it
computationally expensive. We derive an improved version of the high-order

Upon breaking translations spontaneously, new gapless collective modes emerge,
the Nambu-Goldstone bosons of broken translations. When translations are also
weakly broken (eg by disorder or lattice effects), these phonons are pinned
with a mass $m$ and damped at a rate $\Omega$, which we explicitly compute.
This contribution to $\Omega$ is distinct from that of topological defects. We
show that $\Omega\simeq G m^2\Xi$, where $G$ is the shear modulus and $\Xi$ is
related to a diffusivity of the purely spontaneous state. This result follows
from the smallness of the bulk and shear moduli, as would be the case in a
phase with fluctuating translational order. At low temperatures, the collective
modes relax quickly into the heat current, so that late time transport is
dominated by the thermal diffusivity. In this regime, the resistivity in our
model is linear in temperature and the ac conductivity displays a significant
rearranging of the degrees of freedom, as spectral weight is shifted from an
off-axis, pinning peak to a Drude-like peak. These results could shed light on
transport properties in cuprate high $T_c$ superconductors, where quantum
critical behavior and translational order occur over large parts of the phase
diagram and transport shows qualitatively similar features.

dilemma for the illumination and the performance trade-off. In this paper, we
show that despite the weak signals in many areas under extreme short exposure
setting, these signals as a whole can be well utilized through a learning
process which directly translates the weak and noisy ToF camera raw to depth
map. This creates an opportunity to tackle the aforementioned dilemma and make
a very power efficient ToF camera possible. To enable the learning, we collect
a comprehensive dataset under a variety of scenes and photographic conditions
by a specialized ToF camera. Experiments show that our method is able to
robustly process ToF camera raw with the exposure time of one order of
magnitude shorter than that used in conventional ToF cameras. In addition to
evaluating our approach both quantitatively and qualitatively, we also discuss
its implication to designing the next generation power efficient ToF cameras.
We will make our dataset and code publicly available.

forward rapidity have been observed in polarized $p$+$p$ interactions for many
decades, over a large range of center-of-mass energies, and have led to the
investigation of spin-momentum correlations such as the Sivers and Collins
effects. In the last few years, it has been discovered at RHIC that these
single-spin asymmetries may be enhanced or suppressed in $p$+$A$ collisions,
and the nuclear-size and centrality dependence have been studied. A variety of
phenomena have been observed and likely they do not have all a single
explanation; we see an apparent quenching of the TSSA in forward charged hadron
production with increasing nuclear size, while we see an enhancement in the
asymmetry in $J/\psi$ production, and in very forward neutron production even a
sign change in the asymmetry is seen. Other systems, such as $\pi^0$ production
at central rapidity, do not display a nuclear-size dependence. These
observations provide a bridge between the study of the initial state in
heavy-ion collisions and that of the nucleon spin puzzle, and open up a new

characterization of chordal graphs in terms of sequences of what they call
`edge-erasures'. We show that these moves are in fact equivalent to a linear
quotient ordering on $I_{\overline{G}}$, the edge ideal of the complement
graph. Known results imply that $I_{\overline G}$ has linear quotients if and

characterization. We investigate higher-dimensional analogues of this result,
and show that in fact linear quotients for more general circuit ideals of
$d$-clutters can be characterized in terms of removing exposed circuits in the
complement clutter. Restricting to properly exposed circuits can be
characterized by a homological condition. This leads to a notion of higher
dimensional chordal clutters which borrows from commutative algebra and simple
homotopy theory. The interpretation of linear quotients in terms of
shellability of simplicial complexes also has applications to a conjecture of
Simon regarding the extendable shellability of $k$-skeleta of simplices. Other
connections to combinatorial commutative algebra, chordal complexes, and

diverging resistivity at zero temperature: holographic strange insulators.

the holographic entropy polyhedron which captures holographic entropy

Comparing the polyhedron with the holographic entropy cone, we find perfect

In the context of the viscous fluid conduit system, the present work introduces
a simple, practical method to precisely control the location, time, and spatial
profile of wavebreaking in dispersive hydrodynamic systems with only boundary
control. The method is based on tracking the dispersionless characteristics
backward from the desired wavebreaking profile to the boundary. In addition to
the generation of approximately step-like Riemann and box problems, the method
is generalized to other, approximately piecewise-linear dispersive hydrodynamic
profiles including the triangle wave and N-wave. A definition of dispersive
hydrodynamic wavebreaking is used to obtain quantitative agreement between the
predicted location and time of wavebreaking, viscous fluid conduit experiment,
and direct numerical simulations for a range of flow conditions. Observed
space-time characteristics also agree with triangle and N-wave predictions. The
characteristic boundary control method introduced here enables the experimental
investigation of a variety of wavebreaking profiles and is expected to be
useful in other dispersive hydrodynamic media. As an application of this
approach, soliton fission from a large, box-like disturbance is observed both
experimentally and numerically, motivating future analytical treatment.

angular and CP-violating observables by exploiting approximate reconstruction
algorithms using information from detectable final-state particles only, a case
of special interest for hadron collider experiments. The resolution on the

decays simulated in a forward detector geometry like LHCb. A novel method to
correct the observable values for the reconstruction inaccuracies based on
detector simulation is successfully tested on simulated data and the decrease
in precision with respect to a perfect reconstruction is evaluated. The
$D^{*+}$ longitudinal polarization fraction and one of the CP-violating

The extraction of phase space distributions from the template fit selecting
$\bar{B}\to D^{*+} l^-\bar{\nu}_{l}$ decays and associated systematic

periodic transit events along with the results of its inaugural application to
the recently released 2 minute light curves of low mass stars from the first
two TESS sectors. The stellar parameters within our sample are refined using
precise parallax measurements from the GAIA DR2 which reduces the number of low
mass stars in our sample relative to those listed in the TESS Input Catalog. In
lieu of the follow-up observations required to confirm or refute the planetary
nature of transit-like signals, a validation of transit-like events flagged by
our pipeline is performed statistically. The resulting vetted catalog contains
seven probable blended eclipsing binaries, eight known TOIs, plus eight new
planet candidates smaller than 4 Earth radii. This work demonstrates the
ability of our pipeline to detect sub-Neptune-sized planet candidates which
to-date, represent some of the most attractive targets for future atmospheric
characterization via transmission or thermal emission spectroscopy and for
radial velocity efforts aimed at the completion of the TESS level one

been developed to identify these autism risk genes. Previous research analyzes
the BrainSpan dataset, which contains gene expression of brain tissues from
varying regions and developmental periods. Since the spatiotemporal properties
of brain tissue is known to affect the gene expression's covariance, previous
research have focused only on a specific subset of samples to avoid the issue

resistive networks with current sources, we describe an algorithm that produces
initial conditions that are often outside of the basin of attraction of the

with a sufficient number of clusters or contains a sufficiently long induced
subpath without cut vertices of the graph then there is a non-synchronous
stable phase-locked solution. Thus, we provide a partial answer to when the

the Lifshitz Ward identity for the EMD theory. For transport, we target our
analysis at finite chemical potential and include axion fields to generate

we are able to demonstrate that the diffusivities are governed by the
engineering dimension of the diffusion coefficient, $[D]=2-z$. Consequently, a
$\beta$-function defined as the derivative of the trace of the diffusion matrix
with respect to the effective lattice spacing changes sign precisely at $z=2$.
At $z=2$, the diffusion equation exhibits perfect scale invariance and the
corresponding diffusion constant is the pure number $1/d_s$ for both the charge

we find that as $z\to\infty$, the charge diffusion constant vanishes,
indicating charge localization. Deviation from universal decoupled transport

CJPAS (2019) Vol. 13 , pp. 4765-4772",,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work performs a comparative numerical study of the impurity average
self-frequency $\tilde{\omega}$ in an unconventional superconducting alloy with
non-magnetic impurities. Two methods are used: the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm as a non-linear minimization problem, and a fixed-point iteration
procedure. The unconventional superconducting renormalized by impurities \bw is
a self-consistent complex non-linear equation with two varying parameters: the
impurity concentration $\Gamma^+$ and the strength of the impurities c, for
which its numerical solution is a computational challenge. Throughout this
study $\tilde{\omega}$ is the renormalized frequency, \bg represents the
inverse of the residual average lifetime $\tau$ at zero frequency, and $N/N_0$
is the normalized superconducting density of states (DOS). This study uses an
order parameter that corresponds to the high-temperature superconducting
ceramics (HTS) with a well-established gap symmetry. The results reveal the
computational efficiency of the non-linear minimization technique by improving
the calculations of the $\tilde{\omega}$ computation when using a 2D parameter
space ($\Gamma^+$, c), particularly in the unitary regime, where the imaginary
part of $\tilde{\omega}$ is a complicated expression of those parameters; this
allows to enhance the study of the universal behavior of this particular
quantum mechanical state.

yield couplings in a formal $1/S$ expansion, with $S$ being the spin amplitude.
The result is an effective triangular-lattice XXZ model, with planar
ferromagnetic order for large $S$ and a stripe-ordered Ising ground state for
small $S$, the latter being the result of frustrated Ising interactions. Within
the semiclassical analysis, the transition point between the two orders is
located at $S_c=0.646$, being very close to the relevant case $S=1/2$. Near
$S=S_c$ quantum fluctuations tend to destabilize magnetic order. We conjecture
that this applies to $S=1/2$, thus explaining the observed partial-disorder

the existence of dark matter. However, even in the presence of a dark matter
halo, other galactic-scale observations, such as the Baryonic Tully-Fisher
Relation and the Radial Acceleration Relation, remain challenging to explain.
This has motivated long-distance, infrared modifications to gravity as an
alternative to the dark matter hypothesis as well as various DM theories with
similar phenomenology. In general, the standard lore has been that any model
that reduces to the phenomenology of MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) on
galactic scales explains essentially all galaxy-scale observables. We present a
framework to test precisely this statement using local Milky Way observables,
including the vertical acceleration field, the rotation curve, the baryonic
surface density, and the stellar disk profile. We focus on models that predict
scalar amplifications of gravity, i.e., models that increase the magnitude but
do not change the direction of the gravitational acceleration. We find that
models of this type are disfavored relative to a simple dark matter halo model
because the Milky Way data requires a substantial amplification of the radial
acceleration with little amplification of the vertical acceleration. We
conclude that models which result in a MOND-like force struggle to
simultaneously explain both the rotational velocity and vertical motion of
nearby stars in the Milky Way.

Crab in the X-ray regime within hours before decaying to a quiescent level in
less than 2 weeks, clearly indicative of binarity. Since the outburst of CI
Cam, a number of sgB[e] stars have been identified as X-ray overluminous for a
single star (i.e. $L_X > 10^{-7}~L_{bol}$). This small population has recently
expanded to include two Ultra Luminous X-ray sources (ULX), Holmberg II X-1 and
NGC300 ULX-1/supernova imposter SN2010da. We revisit CI Cam to investigate its
behaviour over several timescales and shed further light on the nature of the
compact object in the system, its X-ray outburst in 1998 and the binary system
parameters. We analyse archival XMM-Newton EPIC-pn spectra and light curves
along with new data from Swift and NuSTAR. We also present high-resolution
MERCATOR/HERMES optical spectra, including a spectrum taken 1.02 days after our
NuSTAR observation. Despite being in quiescence, CI Cam is highly X-ray
variable on timescales of days, both in terms of total integrated flux and
spectral shape. We interpret these variations by invoking the presence of an
accreting compact companion immersed in a dense, highly structured, aspherical
circumstellar envelope. The differences in the accretion flux and circumstellar
extinction represent either changes in this environment, triggered by variable
mass loss from the star, or the local conditions to the accretor due to its
orbital motion. We find no evidence for pulsations in the X-ray light curve. CI
Cam has many similarities with SN2010da across mid-IR, optical and X-ray
wavelengths suggesting that, subject to distance determination for CI Cam, if
CI Cam was located in an external galaxy its 1998 outburst would have led to a
classification as a supernova imposter.

obtain an expression for the lower bound of their MPS bond dimension, and an
upper bound for the rank of their MPS matrices. In terms of RBM, we provide an
algorithm to derive the RBM for the cocycle Hamiltonians whose MPS matrices are
proved to be of rank 1. Moreover, the RBM-MPS produced by our algorithm has the

celestial equator and in both Galactic hemispheres, thus increasing its visible
length to ~ 210 degrees equivalent to ~150 kpc in physical extent. Taking
advantage of the large number of RR Lyrae stars in the OS, we extract accurate
distances and proper motions across the entire stretch of the tidal debris
studied. As delineated by the GDR2 RR Lyrae, the stream exhibits two prominent
twists in its shape on the sky which are accompanied by changes in the
tangential motion. We complement the RR Lyrae maps with those created using
GDR2 Red Giants and the DECam Legacy Survey Main Sequence Turn-Off stars. The
behavior of the OS track on the sky is consistent across all three tracers
employed. We detect a strong non-zero motion in the across-stream direction for
a substantial portion of the stream. Such a misalignment between the debris
track and the streaming velocity cannot be reproduced in a static gravitational
potential and signals an interaction with a massive perturber.

disk (CBD) surrounding the stellar components in eccentric binaries are
examined via two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. The degree to which
gas fills the cavity between the circumstellar disks (CSDs) and the CBD is
found to be greater for highly eccentric systems, in comparison to
low-eccentricity systems, reflecting the spatial extent over which mass enters
into the cavity throughout the orbit. The pattern of the gas flow in the cavity
differs for eccentric binaries from that of binaries in a circular orbit. In
particular, the former reveals tightly wound gas streams and figure-eight-like
structures for systems characterized by eccentricities, $e \ge 0.4$, whereas
the latter only reveal relatively loosely bent streams from the CBD to the
CSDs. Hence, the description of the stream structures can be a probe of
sufficient non-circularity of the binary orbital motion. Given that the inner
edge of the CBD is not very well defined for highly eccentric systems due to
the complex gas structures, it is suggested that the area of the cavity for
high-sensitivity imaging observations may prove to be a more useful diagnostic
for probing the effectiveness of CBD clearing in the future.

bosons to be approximately inert, meaning that they have suppressed VEVs and
suppressed mixing with the Standard Model Higgs. In this case, single
production of the new Higgs bosons is suppressed, but electroweak pair
production is unsuppressed. We study the phenomenology of a minimal 2 Higgs

phenomenology of the model is essentially fixed by the masses of the exotic

(PHIBSS), we present the PHIBSS2 legacy program, a survey of the molecular gas
properties of star-forming galaxies on and around the star formation main
sequence (MS) at different redshifts using NOEMA. This survey significantly
extends the existing sample of star-forming galaxies with CO molecular gas
measurements, probing the peak epoch of star formation (z=1-1.6) as well as its
building-up (z=2-3) and winding-down (z=0.5-0.8) phases. The targets are drawn
from the GOODS, COSMOS, and AEGIS deep fields and uniformly sample the MS in
the stellar mass (M*) - star formation rate (SFR) plane with log(M*/Msun) =
10-11.8. We describe the survey strategy and sample selection before focusing
on the results obtained at z=0.5-0.8, where we report 60 CO(2-1) detections out
of 61 targets. We determine their molecular gas masses and separately obtain
disc sizes and bulge-to-total (B/T) luminosity ratios from HST I-band images.
The median molecular gas-to-stellar mass ratio, gas fraction, and depletion
time as well as their dependence with M* and offset from the MS follow
published scaling relations for a much larger sample of galaxies spanning a
wider range of redshifts. The galaxy-averaged Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation
between molecular gas and SFR surface densities is strikingly linear, pointing
towards similar star formation timescales within galaxies at any given epoch.
In terms of morphology, the molecular gas content, the SFR, the disc stellar
mass, and the disc molecular gas fraction do not seem to correlate with B/T and
the stellar surface density, which suggests an ongoing supply of fresh
molecular gas to compensate for the build-up of the bulge. Our measurements do
not yield any significant variation of the depletion time with B/T and hence no
strong evidence for morphological quenching within the scatter of the MS.

able to lose their charge as they evaporate leads to an upper bound on the
product of a charged particle's mass and the cutoff scale above which the
effective description of the theory breaks down. This suggests that a
non-trivial version of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) may also apply to
gauge symmetries that are discrete, despite there being no associated massless
field, therefore pushing the conjecture beyond the slogan that `gravity is the
weakest force'. Here, we take a step towards making this expectation more
precise by studying $\mathbb{Z}_N$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2^N$ gauge symmetries
realised via theories of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show that applying
the WGC to a dual description of an Abelian Higgs model leads to constraints
that allow us to saturate but not violate existing bounds on discrete
symmetries based on black hole arguments. In this setting, considering the
effect of discrete hair on black holes naturally identifies the cutoff of the
effective theory with the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and provides
a mechanism through which discrete hair can be lost without modifying the
gravitational sector. We explore the possible implications of these arguments
for understanding the smallness of the weak scale compared to $M_{Pl}$.

observation when the inflaton is associated with one of the singlet fields
associated with neutrino mass generation. During inflation, the vacuum remains
in the unbroken GUT phase, and GUT symmetry breaking occurs later when a field
with a flat direction (the flaton) acquires a vacuum expectation value.
Inflaton decay and the reheating process depend crucially on GUT symmetry
breaking, as decay channels open and close, depending on the value of the
flaton vacuum expectation value. Here, we consider the simultaneous
cosmological evolution of both the inflaton and flaton fields after inflation.
We distinguish weak, moderate and strong reheating regimes, and calculate in
each case the entropy produced as all fields settle to their global minima.
These three reheating scenarios differ in the value of a Yukawa coupling that
introduces mass mixing between the singlets and the ${\bf 10}$s of SU(5). The
dynamics of the GUT transition has an important impact on the production of
gravitinos, and we also discuss the pattern of neutrino masses we expect in

surface code tracks the hashing bound exactly for all biases, and show how to
exploit these features to achieve significant improvement in logical failure
rate. First, we consider the infinite bias limit, meaning pure dephasing. We
prove that the error threshold of the modified surface code for pure dephasing
noise is $50\%$, i.e., that all qubits are fully dephased, and this threshold
can be achieved by a polynomial time decoding algorithm. We demonstrate that
the sub-threshold behavior of the code depends critically on the precise shape
and boundary conditions of the code. That is, for rectangular surface codes
with standard rough/smooth open boundaries, it is controlled by the parameter
$g=\gcd(j,k)$, where $j$ and $k$ are dimensions of the surface code lattice. We
demonstrate a significant improvement in logical failure rate with pure
dephasing for co-prime codes that have $g=1$, and closely-related rotated
codes, which have a modified boundary. The effect is dramatic: the same logical
failure rate achievable with a square surface code and $n$ physical qubits can
be obtained with a co-prime or rotated surface code using only $O(\sqrt{n})$
physical qubits. Finally, we use approximate maximum likelihood decoding to
demonstrate that this improvement persists for a general Pauli noise biased
towards dephasing. In particular, comparing with a square surface code, we
observe a significant improvement in logical failure rate against biased noise
using a rotated surface code with approximately half the number of physical
qubits.

that the model may have an integrable spin-chain interpretation. Finally, as a
check of our proposal, we compute the spectrum from the worldsheet CFT in the
case of highest-weight representations of the underlying Ka\v{c}-Moody
algebras, and show that the mirror-TBA prediction matches it on the nose.

models and show that a successful scenario requires either small Yukawa
couplings, implying loss of experimental signals, and/or quasi-degeneracy among
singlets mass of different generations, suggesting extra structure must be

as hybrid seesaw. This combines the TeV degrees of freedom of the inverse
seesaw with those of a high-scale ($M_N\gg$ TeV) seesaw module in such a way as
to retain the main features of both pictures: naturally small neutrino masses,
successful leptogenesis, and accessible experimental signatures. We show how
the required structure can arise from a more fundamental theory with a gauge
symmetry or from warped extra dimensions/composite Higgs. We provide a detailed
derivation of all the analytical formulae necessary to analyze leptogenesis in

non-Gaussian tools, in particular the Minkowski Functionals
(MFs)---morphological descriptors including area, perimeter, and genus---in an
attempt to recover the higher-order information. We use convergence maps from
the Cosmological Massive Neutrino Simulations (\texttt{MassiveNus}) and assume
galaxy noise, density, and redshift distribution for an LSST-like survey. We
show that MFs are sensitive to the neutrino mass sum, and the sensitivity is
redshift dependent and is non-Gaussian. We find that redshift tomography
significantly improves the constraints on neutrino mass for MFs, compared to
the improvements for the power spectrum. We attribute this to the stronger
redshift dependence of neutrino effects on small scales. We then build an
emulator to model the power spectrum and MFs, and study the constraints on
$[M_{\nu}$, $\Omega_{m}$, $A_{s}]$ from the power spectrum, MFs, and their
combination. We show that MFs significantly outperform the power spectrum in
constraining neutrino mass, by more than a factor of four. However, a thorough
study of the impact from systematics such as baryon physics and galaxy shape
and redshift biases will be important to realize the full potential of MFs.

are no longer conserved in the quantum theory. In this paper, we discuss a new
example for quantum electromagnetic fields propagating in the presence of

of the source-free Maxwell action is anomalous in curved spacetimes. The
classical Noether charge associated with these transformations accounts for the
net circular polarization or the optical helicity of the electromagnetic field.
Therefore, our results describe the way the spacetime curvature changes the
helicity of photons and opens the possibility of extracting information from
strong gravitational fields through the observation of the polarization of
photons. We also argue that the physical consequences of this anomaly can be
understood in terms of the asymmetric quantum creation of photons by the

corresponding conserved quantities cannot be generated by quantum dynamics.
Thus, any such coherence represents a potentially valuable resource of
asymmetry, which can be used, for example, to enhance the precision of quantum
metrology or to enable state transitions in quantum thermodynamics. Here we ask
if such superpositions, already present in a reference system, can be broadcast
to other systems, thereby distributing asymmetry indefinitely at the expense of
creating correlations. We prove a no-go theorem showing that this is forbidden
by quantum mechanics in every finite-dimensional system. In doing so we also
answer some open questions in the quantum information literature concerning the
sharing of timing information of a clock and the possibility of catalysis in
quantum thermodynamics. We also prove that even weaker forms of broadcasting,
of which Aberg's `catalytic coherence' is a particular example, can only occur
in the presence of infinite-dimensional reference systems. Our results set
fundamental limits to the creation and manipulation of quantum coherence and
shed light on the possibilities and limitations of quantum reference frames to
act catalytically without being degraded.

out-of-equilibrium organization in virtually all living things. Often this
takes the form of converting the free energy stored in nonequilibrium chemical
potential differences into useful work, via a series of reactions involving the
binding, chemical catalysis, and unbinding of small molecules. Such chemical
reactions occur on timescales much faster than the protein conformational
rearrangements they induce. Here, we derive the energetic cost for driving a
system out of equilibrium via a series of such effectively instantaneous (and
hence discrete) perturbations. This analysis significantly generalizes
previously established results, and provides insight into qualitative, as well
as quantitative, aspects of finite-time, minimum-dissipation discrete control
protocols. We compare our theoretical formalism to an exactly solvable model

objective is on recovering the high-dimensional cross-sectional covariance
matrix of the random errors with optimality. In this problem, not all
components of the random vector are observed at the same time and the
measurement errors are latent variables, leading to major challenges besides
high data dimensionality. We propose a new covariance matrix estimator in this
context with appropriate localization and thresholding, and then conduct a
series of comprehensive theoretical investigations of the proposed estimator.
By developing a new technical device integrating the high-frequency data
feature with the conventional notion of $\alpha$-mixing, our analysis
successfully accommodates the challenging serial dependence in the measurement
errors. Our theoretical analysis establishes the minimax optimal convergence
rates associated with two commonly used loss functions; and we demonstrate with
concrete cases when the proposed localized estimator with thresholding achieves
the minimax optimal convergence rates. Considering that the variances and
covariances can be small in reality, we conduct a second-order theoretical
analysis that further disentangles the dominating bias in the estimator. A
bias-corrected estimator is then proposed to ensure its practical finite sample
performance. We also extensively analyze our estimator in the setting with
jumps, and show that its performance is reasonably robust. We illustrate the
promising empirical performance of the proposed estimator with extensive
simulation studies and a real data analysis.

for which the wavefunction is real evade such restrictions despite remaining
subject to long-standing criticism regarding physical discontinuity,

detailed numerical simulation to investigate inflationary preheating when the
potential of the inflaton is a power-law function with arbitrary power index.
To achieve a successful graceful exit from a primordial inflationary phase to a
smooth, oscillatory phase during preheating, we assume the inflaton potential
reduces to a quadratic function in the infrared regime, which may be regarded
as a mass term at low energy scales. With this simplification, our numerical
method may be applied to unconventional chaotic inflation models. To
demonstrate its validity, we numerically analyze the preheating stage of
axion-monodromy inflation which is inspired by string theory. By performing
perturbation analyses, our result shows that the power spectrum of primordial

of occurrence of ECSNe using nucleosynthesis simulations of the latter
scenario, population synthesis, the solar abundance distribution, pre-solar
meteoritic oxide grain isotopic ratio measurements and the white dwarf
mass-radius relation. Tracer particles from 3d hydrodynamic simulations were
post-processed with a large nuclear reaction network in order to determine the
complete compositional state of the bound ONeFe remnant and the ejecta, and
population synthesis simulations were performed in order to estimate the ECSN
rate with respect to the CCSN rate. The 3d deflagration simulations drastically
overproduce the neutron-rich isotopes $^{48}$Ca, $^{50}$Ti, $^{54}$Cr,
$^{60}$Fe and several of the Zn isotopes relative to their solar abundances.
Using the solar abundance distribution as our constraint, we place an upper
limit on the frequency of thermonuclear ECSNe as 1$-$3~\% the frequency at
which core-collapse supernovae (FeCCSNe) occur. This is on par with or 1~dex
lower than the estimates for ECSNe from single stars. The upper limit from the
yields is also in relatively good agreement with the predictions from our
population synthesis simulations. The $^{54}$Cr/$^{52}$Cr and
$^{50}$Ti/$^{48}$Ti isotopic ratios in the ejecta are a near-perfect match with
recent measurements of extreme pre-solar meteoritc oxide grains, and
$^{53}$Cr/$^{52}$Cr can also be matched if the ejecta condenses before mixing
with the interstellar medium. Theoretical mass-radius relations for the bound
ONeFe WD remnants of these explosions are apparently consistent with several
observational WD candidates.

beyond. In this paper, we couple astrometric data from Gaia DR2 with elemental
abundances from APOGEE DR14 to characterize the kinematics and chemistry of
in-situ and accreted populations up to $\rm [Fe/H] \sim -2$. Accreted stars
appear to significantly impact the Galactic chemo-kinematic relations, not only
at $\rm [Fe/H] < -1$, but also at metallicities typical of the thick and
metal-poor thin discs. They constitute about 60% of all stars at $\rm [Fe/H] <
-1$, the remaining 40% being made of (metal-weak) thick disc stars. We find
that the stellar kinematic fossil record shows the imprint left by this
accretion event which heated the old Galactic disc. We are able to age-date
this kinematic imprint, showing that the accretion occurred between 9 and 11
Gyr ago, and that it led to the last significant heating of the Galactic disc.
An important fraction of stars with abundances typical of the (metal-rich)
thick disc, and heated by this interaction, is now found in the Galactic halo.
Indeed about half of the kinematically defined halo at few kpc from the Sun is
composed of metal-rich thick disc stars. Moreover, we suggest that this
metal-rich thick disc component dominates the stellar halo of the inner Galaxy.
The new picture that emerges from this study is one where the standard
non-rotating in-situ halo population, the collapsed halo, seems to be more
elusive than ever.

with time, spanning a few decades of observations. This trend has been
interpreted as evidence for the slow and gradual formation of dust in CCSNe.
Observationally, the trend exhibits a $ t^2$ behavior, exactly what is expected
from an expanding optically thick ejecta. In this case, the observed dust
resides in the infrared (IR)-thin ""photosphere"" of the ejecta, and constitutes
only a fraction of the total dust mass. We therefore propose that dust
formation proceeds very rapidly, condensing most available refractory elements
within two years after the explosion. At early epochs, only a fraction of the
dust emission escapes the ejecta accounting for the low observed dust mass. The
ejecta's entire dust content is unveiled only a few decades after the
explosion, with the gradual decrease in its IR opacity. Corroborating evidence
for this picture includes the early depletions of refractory elements in the

for three sources. For those AGNs with extended emission coincident with the
optical axis, we find that spatial scales of the residual images are consistent
with 0.1 - 1 kpc scale distances to which dust can be heated by the AGN. Using
previously published subarcsecond 1 - 20 um imaging and spectroscopic data
along with our new observations, we construct broadband spectral energy

Using results from Clumpy torus models and the Bayesian inference tool

Ordinal Regression (NPSVOR) is a SVM-based OR model, which learns a hyperplane

then ensembles those learned hyperplanes to predict. The previous studies are
focused on its nonlinear case and got a competitive testing performance, but
its training is time consuming, particularly for large-scale data. In this
paper, we consider NPSVOR's linear case and design an efficient training method

evolution depends on the accepted magnetic braking (MB) law for angular

observations of the time-dependence of rotational braking of Sun-type stars,
where the angular momentum loss rate depends on the donor mass $M_d$, donor
radius $R_d$, and rotation rate $\Omega$, $\dot{J} \propto M_d R_d^{\gamma}
\Omega^3$. The functional form of the Skumanich MB can be also obtained
theoretically assuming a radial magnetic field, isotropic isothermal winds, and
boosting of the magnetic field by rotation. Here we show that this simple form
of the Skumanich MB law gives mass transfer rates an order of magnitude too
weak to explain most observed persistent LMXBs. This failure suggests that the
standard Skumanich MB law should not be employed to interpret Galactic, or
extragalactic, LMXB populations, with either detailed stellar codes or rapid
binary population synthesis codes. We investigate modifications for the MB law,

This finding is likely an imprint of the chiral symmetry restoration in the
baryonic sector of QCD, and is expected to occur also in cold dense matter,
which makes it of major relevance for compact stars. By contrast, typical
effective models for compact star matter embody chiral physics solely in the
deconfined sector, with quarks as degrees of freedom. In this contribution, we
present a description of QCD matter based on the effective hybrid
quark-meson-nucleon model. Its characteristic feature is that, under
neutron-star conditions, the chiral symmetry is restored in a first-order phase
transition deep in the hadronic phase, before the deconfinement of quarks takes
place. We discuss the implications of the parity doubling of baryons on the
mass-radius relation for compact stars obtained in accordance with the modern
constraints on the mass from PSR J0348+0432, the compactness from GW170817, as

  from Ground-Truth",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic machine learning-based detectors of various psychological and
social phenomena (e.g., emotion, stress, engagement) have great potential to
advance basic science. However, when a detector $d$ is trained to approximate
an existing measurement tool (e.g., a questionnaire, observation protocol),
then care must be taken when interpreting measurements collected using $d$
since they are one step further removed from the underlying construct. We
examine how the accuracy of $d$, as quantified by the correlation $q$ of $d$'s
outputs with the ground-truth construct $U$, impacts the estimated correlation
between $U$ (e.g., stress) and some other phenomenon $V$ (e.g., academic
performance). In particular: (1) We show that if the true correlation between
$U$ and $V$ is $r$, then the expected sample correlation, over all vectors
$\mathcal{T}^n$ whose correlation with $U$ is $q$, is $qr$. (2) We derive a
formula for the probability that the sample correlation (over $n$ subjects)
using $d$ is positive given that the true correlation is negative (and
vice-versa); this probability can be substantial (around $20-30\%$) for values
of $n$ and $q$ that have been used in recent affective computing studies. %We
also show that this probability decreases monotonically in $n$ and in $q$. (3)
With the goal to reduce the variance of correlations estimated by an automatic
detector, we show that training multiple neural networks
$d^{(1)},\ldots,d^{(m)}$ using different training architectures and
hyperparameters for the same detection task provides only limited ``coverage''
of $\mathcal{T}^n$.

the critical indexes for the cKdV systems are $-\frac{13}{12}$, $-\frac{3}{4}$,
$0$ and $\frac{3}{4}$. As a result, the cKdV systems are classified into four
classes, each of which corresponds to a unique index
$s^{*}\in\{-\frac{13}{12},\,-\frac{3}{4},\,0,\,\frac{3}{4}\}$ such that any
system in this class is locally analytically well-posed if $s>s^{*}$ while the
bilinear estimate fails if $s<s^{*}$.

fast and reliable algorithms to solve the associated non-linear

spaces, existing solvers can become very slow, and their performance dependent
on manual fine-tuning of numerical parameters. In addition, convergence can
sensitively depend on particularities of the EDF's parametrisation under
consideration. Using the widely-used Skyrme EDF as an example, we investigate
the impact of the parametrisation of the EDF, both in terms of the operator
structures present and the size of coupling constants, on the convergence of
numerical solvers. We focus on two aspects of the self-consistency cycle, which
are the diagonalisation of a fixed single-particle Hamiltonian on one hand and
the evolution of the mean-field densities and potentials on the other.
Throughout the article we use a coordinate-space representation, for which the
behaviour of algorithms can be straightforwardly analysed. We propose two
algorithmic improvements that are easily implementable in existing solvers,
heavy-ball dynamics and potential preconditioning. We demonstrate that these
methods can be made virtually parameter-free, requiring no manual fine-tuning
to achieve near-optimal performance except for isolated cases. The combination
of both methods decreases substantially the CPU time required to obtain
converged results. The improvements are illustrated for the MOCCa code that
solves the self-consistent HFB problem in a 3d coordinate space representation

aims at learning this function from the examples of marked point patterns in
order to predict the marks of new point patterns. To approximate (interpolate)
the marking function, in our baseline approach, we build a statistical
regression model of the marks with respect some local point distance
representation. In a more advanced approach, we use a global data
representation via the scattering moments of random measures, which build
informative and stable to deformations data representation, already proven
useful in image analysis and related application domains. In this case, the
regression of the scattering moments of the marked point patterns with respect
to the non-marked ones is combined with the numerical solution of the inverse
problem, where the marks are recovered from the estimated scattering moments.
Considering some simple, generic marks, often appearing in the modeling of
wireless networks, such as the shot-noise values, nearest neighbour distance,
and some characteristics of the Voronoi cells, we show that the scattering
moments can capture similar geometry information as the baseline approach, and
can reach even better performance, especially for non-local marking functions.

arranged in four categories: as preferred orientations of the particle bodies,
the particle surfaces, the contact normals, and the void space. Anisotropy of
the voids is described through image analysis and with Minkowski tensors. The
thirteen measures of anisotropy change during loading, as determined with
three-dimensional discrete element simulations of biaxial plane strain
compression with constant mean stress. Assemblies with four different particle
shapes were simulated. The measures of contact orientation are the most
responsive to loading, and they change greatly at small strains, whereas the
other measures lag the loading process and continue to change beyond the state
of peak stress and even after the deviatoric stress has nearly reached a steady
state. The paper implements a methodology for characterizing the incremental
stiffness of a granular assembly during biaxial loading, with orthotropic
loading increments that preserve the principal axes of the fabric and stiffness
tensors. The linear part of the hypoplastic tangential stiffness is monitored
with oedometric loading increments. This stiffness increases in the direction
of the initial compressive loading but decreases in the direction of extension.
Anisotropy of this stiffness is closely correlated with a particular measure of

lattice Boltzmann methods at various stages of loading and for assemblies with

directional mean free path and is positively correlated with pore width.

sensitivity contours in the DM-mass - coupling constant plane, and compare our
sensitivity contours with the 90% C.L. exclusion limits on the same coupling
constants that we obtain from a reanalysis of the null result of current DM
searches at IceCube/DeepCore. We find that PINGU can effectively probe not only
the canonical spin-independent and spin-dependent DM-nucleon interactions, but
also velocity-dependent or momentum-dependent interactions that generate
coherently enhanced DM-nucleus scattering cross sections. We also find that
PINGU's $5\sigma$ sensitivity contours are significantly below current

annihilation channel. This result shows the importance of lowering the
experimental energy threshold when probing models that generate soft neutrino
energy spectra, and holds true independently of the assumed DM-nucleon
interaction and for all DM masses tested here. When DM primarily annihilates
into $\tau\bar{\tau}$, a PINGU-like detector will improve upon current

of 19 GHz, compared with an emission peak about a frequency of 25 GHz in L1527.
In the TMC, the best constraint on the level of AME polarisation is obtained at
the Planck channel of 28.4 GHz, with an upper limit $\pi_{\rm AME}<$4.2$\,\%$

similar to or smaller than their internal luminosities, implying that many
proto-BD candidates might have had either small accretion activity in a
quiescent manner throughout their lifetime, or be currently exhibiting a
relatively higher (or episodic) mass accretion than the past. There are strong
trends that outflows of many proto-BDs are less active if they are fainter or
have less massive envelopes. The outflow forces and internal luminosities for
more than half of the proto-BD candidates seem to follow an evolutionary track
of a protostar with its initial envelope mass of $\sim$0.08 $\rm M_{\odot}$,
indicating that some BDs may form in less massive dense cores in a way similar

with the `charging parameter', $G\sqrt{T}/n_{\mathrm{e}}$. In the molecular
medium, both carbonaceous and silicate grains have predominantly negative or
neutral charges with narrow distributions. In the cold neutral medium,
carbonaceous and silicate grains vary from negative and narrow distributions,
to predominantly positive and wide distributions depending on the magnitude of
the charging parameter. In the warm neutral medium, grains of all sizes are
positively charged with wide distributions. We derive revised parametric
expressions that can be used to recover the charge distribution function of

with emphasis on the differences between AoI and other well-known performance
metrics in the literature, such as throughput and delay. Building on this, we
explore freshness-aware IoT design for a network in which IoT devices sense
potentially different physical processes and are supposed to frequently update
the status of these processes at a destination node (such as a cellular base
station). Inspired by the recent interest, we also assume that these IoT
devices are powered by wireless energy transfer by the destination node. For
this setting, we investigate the optimal sampling policy that jointly optimizes
wireless energy transfer and scheduling of update packet transmissions from IoT
devices with the goal of minimizing long-term weighted sum-AoI. Using this, we
characterize the achievable AoI region. We also compare this AoI-optimal policy
with the one that maximizes average throughput (throughput-optimal policy), and
demonstrate the impact of system state on their structures. Several promising
directions for future research are also presented.

the learning objective of the actor by penalizing the temporal difference (TD)
error of the critic. This improves stability by avoiding large steps in the
actor update whenever the critic is highly inaccurate. The resulting method,
which we call the TD-regularized actor-critic method, is a simple plug-and-play

measurement of Higgs boson properties. For practical reasons it is of interest
to determine the minimal set of detector specifications required to reach this
and other scientific goals. Such information could be useful in developing a
staged approach to the full collider project with an initial lower-cost version
focused on achieving some of the primary scientific objectives. Here we
investigate the precision obtainable for the $e^+ e^- \rightarrow Z h
\rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^- X$ inclusive cross section and the Higgs boson mass
using the di-muon recoil method, considering a detector that has only an inner
tracking system within a solenoidal magnetic field, surrounded by many nuclear
interaction lengths of absorbing material, and an outer muon identification
system. We find that the sensitivity achievable in these measurements with such
a tracking detector is only marginally reduced compared to that expected for a
general purpose detector with additional electromagnetic and hadronic
calorimeter systems. The difference results mainly from multi-photon
backgrounds that are not as easily rejected with tracking detectors. We also
comment on the prospects for an analogous measurement of the inclusive cross
section $\sigma( e^+ e^- \to Z h \to e^+ e^- X)$. Finally, we study searches
for light scalars utilizing the di-muon recoil method, estimating the projected
reach with a tracking and general purpose detector.

reported, many of the sites are observed in the 84-GHz transition for the first

strikingly similar spectral profiles and a mean and median 36- to 84-GHz
integrated flux density ratio of 2.6 and 1.4.
  Alongside the 36- and 84-GHz observations, we included rare class II methanol
masers at 37.7-, 38.3-, 38.5-, 86.6- and 86.9-GHz, a number of recombination

  We detect a relatively higher rate of HC3N compared to that reported by
MALT90 (once the respective detection limits were taken into account) who
targeted dense dust clumps, suggesting that the class I methanol maser targets
incorporate a relatively higher number of warm protostellar sources. We further
find that there are similar relationships between the integrated flux density
of both class I transitions with the integrated intensity of HC3N, HNC, HCO+,
HNC, SiO and H13CO+. We suggest that this indicates that the integrated flux

phonon dispersion of a freestanding monolayer of two dimensional (2D) materials

experimental limitations of vibrational spectroscopy. Even though electron
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in transmission has recently been shown to

polar materials like boron nitride or oxides, in which huge signals induced by
strong dipole moments are present. On the other hand, measurements on graphene

27 galaxies within nine low mass, gas-rich, late-type dominated groups which we
denote ""Choirs"". We find that majority of the central Choir galaxies have
average HI content: they have a normal gas-mass fraction with respect to
isolated galaxies of the same stellar mass. In contrast, we find more satellite
galaxies with a lower gas-mass fraction than isolated galaxies of the same
stellar mass. A likely reason for the lower gas content in these galaxies is
tidal stripping. Both the specific star formation rate and the star formation
efficiency of the central group galaxies are similar to galaxies in isolation.
The Choir satellite galaxies have similar specific star formation rate as
galaxies in isolation, therefore satellites that exhibit a higher star
formation efficiency simply owe it to their lower gas-mass fractions. We find
that the most HI massive galaxies have the largest HI discs and fall neatly
onto the HI size-mass relation, while outliers are galaxies that are
experiencing interactions. We find that high specific angular momentum could be
a reason for galaxies to retain the large fraction of HI gas in their discs.
This shows that for the Choir groups with no evidence of interactions, as well
as those with traces of minor mergers, the internal galaxy properties dominate
over the effects of residing in a group. The probed galaxy properties
strengthen evidence that the Choir groups represent the early stages of group
assembly.

conditional mathematical expectation, and then, based on the given SBRL and a
stochastic LaSalle-type theorem, a sufficient condition for the existence of
the $H_\infty$ filtering of general nonlinear discrete time-varying stochastic
systems is presented via a new introduced Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI),
which is easily verified. When the worst-case disturbance $\{v^*_k\}_{k\in

studied. Two examples including a practical engineering example show the
effectiveness of our main results.

Discontinuous Fiber Composites (DFCs). Towards this goal, the results of
fracture tests on geometrically-scaled Single Edge Notch Tension (SENT)
specimens are presented and critically discussed for three platelet sizes.
  The results clearly show a decrease in nominal strength as the specimen size
increases. This effect becomes more important as the structure size increases.
It is found that, when the specimen is sufficiently large, the structural
strength scales according to Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) and the
failure occurs in a very brittle way. In contrast, small specimens exhibit a
more pronounced pseudo-ductility with a limited scaling effect and a
significant deviation from LEFM.
  To characterize the fracture energy and the effective length of the fracture
process zone, an approach combining equivalent fracture mechanics and
stochastic finite element modeling is proposed. The model accounts for the
complex random mesostructure of the material by modeling the platelets
explicitly. Thanks to this theoretical framework, the mode I fracture energy of
DFCs is estimated for the first time and it is shown to depend significantly on
the platelet size. In particular, the fracture energy is shown to increase
linearly with the platelet size in the range investigated in this work.

$T_2^*=1.4$~$\mu$s at 150~mT. Their coherence is limited by spin flips of
residual $^{29}$Si nuclei in the isotopically enriched $^{28}$Si host material,
which occur more frequently at lower fields. Our finding indicates that new
trade-offs will be required to ensure the frequency stabilization of spin
qubits and highlights the importance of isotopic enrichment of device
substrates for the realization of a scalable silicon-based quantum processor.

which lowers the image visual quality and also interferes various computer
vision applications. We present a novel rain removal method in this paper,
which consists of two steps, i.e., detection of rain streaks and reconstruction
of the rain-removed image. An accurate detection of rain streaks determines the
quality of the overall performance. To this end, we first detect rain streaks
according to pixel intensities, motivated by the observation that rain streaks
often possess higher intensities compared to other neighboring image
structures. Some mis-detected locations are then refined through a
morphological processing and the principal component analysis (PCA) such that
only locations corresponding to real rain streaks are retained. In the second
step, we separate image gradients into a background layer and a rain streak
layer, thanks to the image quasi-sparsity prior, so that a rain image can be
decomposed into a background layer and a rain layer. We validate the
effectiveness of our method through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
We show that our method can remove rain (even for some relatively bright rain)
from images robustly and outperforms some state-of-the-art rain removal
algorithms.

generation, based on pre-defined textual descriptions of images. To explore
more practical and interactive real-life applications, we introduce a new task
- Interactive Image Editing, where users can guide an agent to edit images via
multi-turn textual commands on-the-fly. In each session, the agent takes a
natural language description from the user as the input and modifies the image
generated in the previous turn to a new design, following the user description.
The main challenges in this sequential and interactive image generation task
are two-fold: 1) contextual consistency between a generated image and the
provided textual description; 2) step-by-step region-level modification to
maintain visual consistency across the generated image sequence in each
session. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Sequential Attention
Generative Adversarial Net-work (SeqAttnGAN), which applies a neural state
tracker to encode the previous image and the textual description in each turn
of the sequence, and uses a GAN framework to generate a modified version of the
image that is consistent with the preceding images and coherent with the
description. To achieve better region-specific refinement, we also introduce a
sequential attention mechanism into the model. To benchmark on the new task, we
introduce two new datasets, Zap-Seq and DeepFashion-Seq, which contain
multi-turn sessions with image-description sequences in the fashion domain.
Experiments on both datasets show that the proposed SeqAttnGANmodel outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on the interactive image editing task across all

closed-loop in coupling that drives the system into an entangled steady state
and produces directional steering between two completely symmetric modes via
quantum interference effects. In the scheme, two modes are coupled with each
other both by a direct binary interaction and by an indirect interaction
through a third intermediate damping mode, creating interference effects
determined by the relative phase between the two physical interaction paths. By
calculating the populations and correlations of the two modes, we show that
depending on the phase, two modes can be prepared into an entangled steady
state with asymmetric and directional steering even if they possess completely
symmetric decoherence properties. Meanwhile, entanglement and steering can be
significantly enhanced due to constructive interference, and thus more robust
to thermal noises. This provides an active method to manipulate the asymmetry
of steering instead of adding asymmetric losses or noises on subsystems at the
cost of reducing steerability. Moreover, we show that the interference effects
can also enhance and control the correlations between other pair of modes in
the loop with opposite phase dependent behavior, indicating monogamy
constraints for distributing correlations among multipartite. The present model
could be applied in cavity optomechanical systems or in antiferromagnets where
all components can mutually interact.

electron irradiation, the H atoms of the hydroxyl are knocked off, creating

Simultaneously, the transition metal atoms partially struck away from the

restructuring. Crystal restructuring is versatile for various MXenes and
dramatically improves the electric conductivity and lessens the anisotropy,
holding significant implications in engineering MXenes at the atomic scale.

calculated from the best-fit two-term Henyey-Greenstein (HG) single-particle
phase function (SPPF) show a wavelength dependence, suggesting that the phase
reddening of Ceres is dominated by single-particle scattering rather than
multiple scattering or small-scale surface roughness. The Hapke roughness
parameter of Ceres is derived to be 20$^\circ\pm$6$^\circ$ with no wavelength
dependence. The phase function of Ceres shows appreciably strong scattering
around 90$^\circ$ phase angle that cannot be fitted with a single-term HG SPPF,
suggesting possible stronger forward scattering than other asteroids previously
analyzed with spacecraft data. We speculate that such a scattering
characteristic of Ceres might be related to its unique surface composition. We
grouped the reflectance data into a 1$^\circ$ latitude-longitude grid and
fitted each grid independently to study the spatial variations of photometric
properties. The albedo and color maps are consistent with previous studies. The
SPPF over the surface of Ceres shows stronger backscattering associated with
lower albedo and vice versa, consistent with the general trend among asteroids.
The Hapke roughness parameter does not vary much across the surface of Ceres,
except for the ancient Vendimia Planitia region that has a slightly higher
roughness. Based on the wavelength dependence of the SPPF of Ceres, we
hypothesize that its regolith grains either contain a considerable fraction of
$\lessapprox\mu$m-sized particles, or are strongly affected by internal
scatterers of this size.

half-scan data is strictly sufficient to produce images with the best temporal
resolution, acquiring a full 360 degree rotation worth of data is beneficial
for wide-cone image reconstruction at negligible additional radiation dose.
Applying Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) algorithm to the heart has
shown to yield significant enhancement in image quality for cardiac CT. But
imaging the heart in large cone angle geometry leads to apparently conflicting
data usage considerations. On the one hand, in addition to using the fastest
available scanner rotation speed, a minimal complete data set of 180 degrees
plus the fan angle is typically used to minimize both cardiac and respiratory
motion. On the other hand, a full 360 degree acquisition helps better handle
the challenges of missing frequencies and incomplete projections associated
with wide-cone half-scan data acquisition. In this paper, we develop a
Spatially Adaptive sinogram Weights MBIR algorithm (SAW-MBIR) that is designed
to achieve the benefits of both half and full-scan reconstructions in order to
maximize temporal resolution over the heart region while providing stable
results over the whole volume covered with the wide-area detector.
Spatially-adaptive sinogram weights applied to each projection measurement in
SAW-MBIR are designed to selectively perform backprojection from the full and
half-scan portion of the sinogram based on both projection angle and
reconstructed voxel location. We demonstrate with experimental results of
SAW-MBIR applied to whole-heart cardiac CT clinical data that overall temporal
resolution matches half-scan while full volume image quality is on par with
full-scan MBIR.

reflect the geologic conditions. We find and analyze different dissolution
events, including diffusive, early and late convection, and shut-down regimes.
Our experiments reveal that in intermediate regime, a so-called `quasi-steady'
state actually never happens. Dissolution flux continuously decreases in this
regime, which is due to a negative feedback loop: the rapid reduction of
pressure following convective dissolution, in turn, decreases the solubility of
CO$_2$ at the gas-brine interface and thus the instability strength. We
introduce a new scaling factor that not only compensates the flux reduction but
also the nonlinearities that arise from different salt types. We present robust
scaling relations for the compensated flux and for the transition times between
consecutive regimes in systems with NaCl (Ra $\sim$ 3271--4841) and
NaCl+CaCl$_2$ mixtures (Ra $\sim$ 2919--4283). We also find that NaCl+CaCl$_2$
mixtures enjoy a longer intermediate period before the shut-down of
dissolution, but with a lower dissolution flux, as compared to NaCl brines...

Despite being intuitive, a naive photometric loss does not ensure proper pixel

such an error is prone to failures.
  We propose a method using Epipolar constraints to make the learning more

rather than using it as labels for training. Our method, although simplistic

initial wavefront morphologies of four selected EUV waves that are closely
associated with jets or flux rope eruptions, using the high spatio-temporal
resolution observations and different perspectives from the Solar Dynamics
Observatory and the Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory. For the jet-driven
waves, the jets originated from one end of the overlying closed loops, and the
arc-shaped wavefront formed around the other far end of the expanding loops.
The extrapolated field lines of the Potential Field Source Surface model show
the close relationships between the jets, the wavefronts, and the overlying
closed loops. For the flux-rope-driven waves, the flux ropes (sigmoids) lifted
off beneath the overlying loops, and the circular wavefronts had an intimate
spatio-temporal relation with the expanding loops. All the results suggest that
the configuration of the overlying loops and their locations relative to the
erupting cores are very important for the formation and morphology of the
wavefronts, and both two jet-driven waves and two flux-rope-driven waves are
likely triggered by the sudden expansion of the overlying closed loops. We also
propose that the wavefront of EUV wave is possibly integrated by a chain of
wave components triggered by a series of separated expanding loops.

linear subspace of the original state space. Such subspaces are typically
computed using methods such as balanced truncation, rational interpolation, the
reduced-basis method, and (balanced) POD. Unfortunately, restricting the state
to evolve in a linear subspace imposes a fundamental limitation to the accuracy
of the resulting reduced-order model (ROM). In particular, linear-subspace ROMs
can be expected to produce low-dimensional models with high accuracy only if
the problem admits a fast decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width (e.g.,
diffusion-dominated problems). Unfortunately, many problems of interest exhibit
a slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width (e.g., advection-dominated problems). To
address this, we propose a novel framework for projecting dynamical systems
onto nonlinear manifolds using minimum-residual formulations at the
time-continuous and time-discrete levels; the former leads to manifold Galerkin
projection, while the latter leads to manifold least-squares Petrov--Galerkin
(LSPG) projection. We perform analyses that provide insight into the

to examine various energy reduction methods for which energy consumption could
be reduced and lead us to green cloud computing. In this paper, our aim is to
propose a virtual machine selection algorithm to improve the energy efficiency
of a cloud data center. We are also presenting experimental results of the
proposed algorithm in a cloud computing based simulation environment. The
proposed algorithm dynamically took the virtual machines' allocation,
deallocation, and reallocation action to the physical server. However, it
depends on the load and heuristics based on the analysis placement of a virtual
machine which is decided over time. From the results obtained from the
simulation, we have found that our proposed virtual machine selection algorithm
reduces the total energy consumption by 19% compared to the existing one.
Therefore, the energy consumption cost of a cloud data center reduces and also
lowers the carbon footprint. Simulation-based experimental results show that
the proposed heuristics which are based on resource provisioning algorithms
reduce the energy consumption of the cloud data center and decrease the virtual
machine's migration rate.

to calculate the nonlinear Hall response of the tilted 2D Dirac model, which is
the symmetry-allowed minimal model for the nonlinear Hall effect and can serve
as a building block in realistic band structures. More importantly, we
construct the general scaling law of the nonlinear Hall effect, which may help

decreases with increasing distance from the black hole from 5,000 to 200,000
Schwarzschild radii. The data, showing predominantly negative RM sign without
significant difference of the RMs on the northern and southern jet edges,
suggest that the spatial extent of the Faraday screen is much larger than the
jet. We apply models of hot accretion flows, thought to be prevalent in active
galactic nuclei having relatively low luminosity such as M87, and find that the
decrease of RM is described well by a gas density profile $\rho \propto
r^{-1}$. This behavior matches the theoretically expected signature of
substantial winds, nonrelativistic un-collimated gas outflows from hot
accretion flows, which is consistent with the results of various numerical
simulations. The pressure profile inferred from the density profile is flat
enough to collimate the jet, which can result in gradual acceleration of the
jet in a magneto-hydrodynamical process. This picture is in good agreement with
the observed gradual collimation and acceleration of the M87 jet inside the
Bondi radius. The dominance of negative RMs suggests that jet and wind axis are
misaligned such that the jet emission exposes only one side of the toroidal
magnetic fields permeating the winds.

pool of interactive assessment items (questions) that are analyzed into a
hierarchy of skills or Knowledge Components (KCs). Educational data mining
techniques can be used to analyze students performance data in order to
optimize the mapping of items to KCs. Standard methods that map items into KCs
using item-similarity measures make the implicit assumption that students
performance on items that depend on the same skill should be similar. This
assumption holds if the latent trait (mastery of the underlying skill) is
relatively fixed during students activity, as in the context of testing, which
is the primary context in which these measures were developed and applied.
However, in adaptive learning systems that aim for learning, and address
subject matters such as K6 Math that consist of multiple sub-skills, this
assumption does not hold. In this paper we propose a new item-similarity
measure, termed Kappa Learning (KL), which aims to address this gap. KL
identifies similarity between items under the assumption of learning, namely,
that learners mastery of the underlying skills changes as they progress through
the items. We evaluate Kappa Learning on data from a computerized tutor that
teaches Fractions for 4th grade, with experts tagging as ground truth, and on
simulated data. Our results show that clustering that is based on Kappa
Learning outperforms clustering that is based on commonly used similarity

are usually built based on observational constraints such as starlight
extinction and polarization, but dynamical constraints such as grain rotation
are not considered. In this paper, we show that a newly discovered effect by
Hoang et al., so-called RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD), can act as an
important dynamical constraint for dust models. Using this dynamical
constraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for
different dust models, including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and
amorphous carbon mantle, and compact grain model for the different radiation
fields. We find that the different dust models have different maximum size due
to their different tensile strengths, and the largest maximum size corresponds
to compact grains with the highest tensile strength. We show that the composite
grain model cannot be ruled out if constituent particles are very small with
radius $a_{p}\le$ 25 nm, but large composite grains would be destroyed if the
particles are large with $a_{p}\ge 50$ nm. We suggest that grain internal
structures can be constrained with observations using the dynamical RATD
constraint for strong radiation fields such as supernova, nova, or star-forming
regions. Finally, our obtained results suggest that micron-sized grains perhaps
have compact/core-mantle structures or have composite structures but located in
regions with slightly higher gas density and weaker radiation intensity than

the original spin chain Hamiltonian appear in the time-averaged effective
Hamiltonian once the control fields are applied, implying that spin-spin
interactions can be engineered via the application of static and oscillating

used to improve the performance of the spin chain for quantum information

reduce peak demand and mitigate contingency issues on distribution lines and
substations. Specifically, the campus based commercial buildings make the major
contributions to peak demand in a distribution system. Note that prior works
neglect the consumers comfort level in performing demand response, which limits
their applications as the incentives are not worth as compared to the loss in
comfort levels for most time. Thus, a framework to comprehensively consider
both operating costs and comfort levels is necessary. Moreover, distributed
energy resources are widely deployed in commercial buildings such as roof top
solar panels, plug in electric vehicles, and energy storage units, which bring
various uncertainties to the distribution systems, i.e., output of renewable;
electricity prices; arrival and departure of plug-in electric vehicles;
business hour demand response signals and flexible energy demand. In this
paper, we propose an optimal demand response framework to enable local control
of demand-side appliances that are usually too small to participate in a retail
electricity market. Several typical small demand side appliances, i.e.,
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, electric water heaters and
plug-in electric vehicles, are considered in our proposed model. Their
operations are coordinated by a central controller, whose objective is to
minimize the total cost and maximize the customers comfort levels for multiple
commercial buildings. A scenario-based stochastic programming is leveraged to
handle the aforementioned uncertainties. Numerical results based on the
practical data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In
addition, the trade off between the operation costs of commercial buildings and
customers comfort levels is illustrated.

propose a finite-size scaling relation of weight factors near critical point,

Murty-Simon conjecture, states that any diameter-2-critical graph of order n
has at most n${}^2$/4 edges, with equality if and only if G is a balanced
complete bipartite graph. Many partial results about this conjecture have been
obtained, in particular it is known to hold for all sufficiently large graphs,
for all triangle-free graphs, and for all graphs with a dominating edge. In
this paper, we discuss ways in which this conjecture can be strengthened.
Extending previous conjectures in this direction, we conjecture that, when we
exclude the class of complete bipartite graphs and one particular graph, the
maximum number of edges of a diameter-2-critical graph is at most ((n --
1)${}^2$/4) + 1. The family of extremal examples is conjectured to consist of
certain twin-expansions of the 5-cycle (with the exception of a set of thirteen
special small graphs). Our main result is a step towards our conjecture: we
show that the Murty-Simon bound is not tight for non-bipartite
diameter-2-critical graphs that have a dominating edge, as they have at most
(n${}^2$/4) -- 2 edges. Along the way, we give a shorter proof of the
Murty-Simon conjecture for this class of graphs, and stronger bounds for more
specific cases. We also characterize diameter-2-critical graphs of order n with
maximum degree n -- 2: they form an interesting family of graphs with a
dominating edge and 2n -- 4 edges.

impurities mediated by one-dimensional gapped helical states. Such states,
containing massive Dirac fermions, may be realized on the edge of a
two-dimensional topological insulator when time-reversal symmetry is weakly
broken. We find that the indirect exchange interaction consists of Heisenberg,
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya, in-plane and out-of-plane Ising terms. These terms decay
exponentially when Fermi level lies inside the bandgap whereas the
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya term has smallest amplitude. Outside the energy gap the
massive helical states modify oscillatory behaviors of the range functions so
that their periods decrease near the edge of band in terms of energy gap or
Fermi energy. In addition, the out-of-plane Ising term vanishes in the case of
zero-gap structure but its oscillation amplitude increases versus energy gap
and decreases as a function of Fermi energy whereas the oscillation amplitudes
of other components remain constant. Analytical results are also obtained for
subgap and over gap regimes. Furthermore, the effects of electron-electron
interactions are analyzed.

This rigid form of implementation which we refer as Hard Realization relies on
strict algorithmic accuracy constraints dictated to digital design engineers.
Hard realization admits paying as much as necessary implementation costs to
preserve computation precision and determinism throughout all the design and
implementation steps. Despite its prior accomplishments, this conventional
paradigm has encountered serious challenges with today's emerging applications
and implementation technologies. Unlike traditional hard computing, the
emerging soft and bio-inspired algorithms do not rely on fully precise and
deterministic computation. Moreover, the incoming nanotechnologies face
increasing reliability issues that prevent them from being efficiently
exploited in hard realization of applications. This article examines Soft
Realization, a novel bio-inspired approach to design and implementation of an
important category of applications noticing the internal brain structure. The
proposed paradigm mitigates major weaknesses of hard realization by (1)
alleviating incompatibilities with today's soft and bio-inspired algorithms
such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, and human sense signal
processing applications, and (2) resolving the destructive inconsistency with
unreliable nanotechnologies. Our experimental results on a set of well-known
soft applications implemented using the proposed soft realization paradigm in
both reliable and unreliable technologies indicate that significant energy,
delay, and area savings can be obtained compared to the conventional

risk control problems, it may be profitable to base decisions both on the
position of the underlying process Xt and on its supremum Xt := sup
0$\le$s$\le$t Xs. Strongly connected to Azema-Yor/generalized
draw-down/trailing stop time (see [AY79]), this framework provides a natural
unification of draw-down and classic first passage times. We illustrate here
the potential of this unified framework by solving a variation of the De
Finetti problem of maximizing expected discounted cumulative
dividends/consumption gained under a barrier policy, until an optimally chosen
Azema-Yor time, with a general spectrally negative Markov model. While
previously studied cases of this problem [APP07, SLG84, AS98, AVZ17, AH18,
WZ18] assumed either L{\'e}vy or diffusion models, and the draw-down function
to be fixed, we describe, for a general spectrally negative Markov model, not
only the optimal barrier but also the optimal draw-down function. This is
achieved by solving a variational problem tackled by Pontryaghins maximum
principle. As a by-product we show that in the L{\'e}vy case the classic first
passage solution is indeed optimal; in the diffusion case, we obtain the
optimality equations, but the existence of solutions improving the classic ones
is left for future work.

support specific types of assets and transactions, and no blockchain will
prevail, the need to perform interblockchain transactions is already pressing.
  In this work we examine the fundamental problem of interoperable and
interconnected blockchains. In particular, we begin by introducing the
Multi-Distributed Ledger Objects (MDLO), which is the result of aggregating
multiple Distributed Ledger Objects -- DLO (a DLO is a formalization of the
blockchain) and that supports append and get operations of records (e.g.,
transactions) in them from multiple clients concurrently. Next, we define the
AtomicAppends problem, which emerges when the exchange of digital assets
between multiple clients may involve appending records in more than one DLO.
Specifically, AtomicAppend requires that either all records will be appended on
the involved DLOs or none. We examine the solvability of this problem assuming
rational and risk-averse clients that may fail by crashing, and under different
client utility and append models, timing models, and client failure scenarios.
We show that for some cases the existence of an intermediary is necessary for
the problem solution. We propose the implementation of such intermediary over a
specialized blockchain, we term Smart DLO (SDLO), and we show how this can be
used to solve the AtomicAppends problem even in an asynchronous, client

a simplicial complex which is embeddable into $\mathbb{R}^r$ for some $d \leq r

  A lower bound of $f_d(C_{r + 1}(n)) = \Omega(n^{\lceil\frac{r}{2}\rceil})$,
which might even be sharp, is given by the cyclic polytopes. To find an upper
bound for the case $r=2d$ we look for forbidden subcomplexes. A generalization
of the theorem of van Kampen and Flores yields those. Then the problem can be
tackled with the methods of extremal hypergraph theory, which gives an upper
bound of $O(n^{d+1-\frac{1}{3^d}})$.
  We also consider whether these bounds can be improved by simple means.

multi-object tracking system to model interaction between vehicles, and the
current road geometry. Therefore, the prediction step of a Labeled
Multi-Bernoulli filter is extended to facilitate modeling interaction between
objects using the Intelligent Driver Model. Furthermore, to consider road map

show that in scenarios where the assumption of a standard motion model is

applied research for many decades, its practice and practitioners seem
empirically still not well studied. Beyond mainly anecdotal evidence
(interviews, on-line discussions), incident reports, and surveys, we are
missing open, large-scale, and long-term investigations that promote knowledge
transfer and research validation. We explore means for work safety
practitioners rely on, factors influencing their performance, and their
perception of their role in the system life cycle. Along with that we examine
observations from previous research. We build a construct of safety practice,
collect data for this construct using an on-line survey, summarise and
interpret the collected data, and investigate several hypotheses based on the
previous observations. We analyse and present the responses of 124
practitioners in safety-critical system and software projects. Aside from other
findings, our data suggests that safety decision making mainly depends on
expert opinion and project memory, lacks evidence that safety is typically a
cost-benefit question, does not exhibit the prejudice that formal methods are
not beneficial, leaves it unclear as to whether or not standards and methods
have become inadequate, and indicates that safety is not typically confused
with reliability. Additionally, we contribute a research design directing
towards explanatory empirical studies of safety practice. Empirical research of
safety practice is still in an early stage, bearing the risk of undesirable
mismatches of the state of the art and the state of practice. However, this

fixing a threshold level $h$ and letting a 1 correspond to the variable being
larger than $h$ arises from a random partition of the index set followed by
coloring {\it all} elements in each partition element 1 or 0 with probabilities
$p$ and $1-p$, independently for different partition elements.
  While it turns out that all discrete Gaussian free fields yield a DC process
when the threshold is zero, for general $n$-dimensional mean zero, variance one
Gaussian vectors with nonnegative covariances, this is true in general when
$n=3$ but is false for $n=4$.
  The behavior is quite different depending on whether the threshold level $h$
is zero or not and we show that there is no general monotonicity in $h$ in
either direction. We also show that all constant variance discrete Gaussian
free fields with a finite number of variables yield DC processes for large
thresholds.
  In the stable case, for the simplest nontrivial symmetric stable vector with
three variables, we obtain a phase transition in the stability exponent
$\alpha$ at the surprising value of $1/2$; if the index of stability is larger
than $1/2$, then the process yields a DC process for large $h$ while if the
index of stability is smaller than $1/2$, then this is not the case.

on intra-class splitting. In one-class classification, feature learning is
challenging, because only samples of one class are available during training.
Hence, state-of-the-art methods require reference multi-class datasets to
pretrain feature extractors. In contrast, the proposed method realizes feature
learning by splitting the given normal class into typical and atypical normal
samples. By introducing closeness loss and dispersion loss, an intra-class
joint training procedure between the two subsets after splitting enables the
extraction of valuable features for one-class classification. Various
experiments on three well-known image classification datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method which outperformed other baseline models in
average.

data-driven inference as a protocol that, given a set of experimental data as a

i) consistent with the data, in the sense that its range contains all the
distributions observed, and, ii) maximally noncommittal, in the sense that its
range is of minimum volume in the space of outcome distributions. We show that
data-driven inference is able to return a unique measurement for any data set

  In analogy to informational completeness for quantum tomography, we define
observational completeness as the property of any set of states that, when fed
into any given measurement, produces a set of outcome distributions allowing
for the correct reconstruction of the measurement via data-driven inference. We
show that observational completeness is strictly stronger than informational
completeness, in the sense that not all informationally complete sets are also
observationally complete. Moreover, we show that for systems with a
(hyper)-spherical state space, the only observationally complete simplex is the
regular one, namely, the symmetric informationally complete set.

proposed method is carried out in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT)

time-domain room impulse response is approximately represented by the
convolutive transfer function (CTF). The multichannel CTFs are adaptively
identified based on the cross-relation method, and using the recursive least
square criterion. Instead of the complex-valued CTF convolution model, we use a
nonnegative convolution model between the STFT magnitude of the source signal
and the CTF magnitude, which is just a coarse approximation of the former
model, but is shown to be more robust against the CTF perturbations. Based on
this nonnegative model, we propose an online STFT magnitude inverse filtering
method. The inverse filters of the CTF magnitude are formulated based on the
multiple-input/output inverse theorem (MINT), and adaptively estimated based on
the gradient descent criterion. Finally, the inverse filtering is applied to
the STFT magnitude of the microphone signals, obtaining an estimate of the STFT
magnitude of the source signal. Experiments regarding both speech enhancement
and automatic speech recognition are conducted, which demonstrate that the
proposed method can effectively suppress reverberation, even for the difficult
case of a moving speaker.

become an arms race between defenders and attackers. While certain defenses,
e.g., \textit{Control Flow Integrity} (CFI), restrict the targets of indirect
control-flow transfers through static and dynamic analysis, attackers could
search the program for available gadgets that fall into the legitimate target
sets to bypass the defenses. There are several tools helping both attackers in
developing exploits and analysts in strengthening their defenses. Yet, these
tools fail to adequately (1) model the deployed defenses, (2) compare them in a
head-to-head way, and (3) use program semantic information to help craft the
attack and the countermeasures.
  Control Flow Integrity (CFI) has proved to be one of the promising defenses
against control flow hijacks and tons of efforts have been made to improve CFI
in various ways in the past decade. However, there is a lack of a systematic
assessment of the existing CFI defenses. In this paper, we present Reckon, a
static source code analysis tool for assessing state-of-the-art static CFI
defenses, by first precisely modeling them and then evaluating them in a
unified framework. Reckon helps determine the level of security offered by
different CFI defenses, and find usable code gadgets even after the CFI
defenses were applied, thus providing an important step towards successful
exploits and stronger defenses. We have used Reckon to assess eight
state-of-the-art static CFI defenses on real-world programs such as Google's
Chrome and Apache Httpd. Reckon provides precise measurements of the residual
attack surfaces, and accordingly ranks CFI policies against each other. It also
successfully paves the way to construct code reuse attacks and to eliminate the
remaining attack surface, by disclosing calltargets under one of the most
restrictive CFI defenses.

We derived the matching conditions for
the spherically symmetric singular hypersurface (in our case it is equivalent
to the world line) in the Weyl$+$Einstein gravity. It was found, that the
residual extrinsic curvature tensor of this surface must be continuous on the
singular hypersurface. The result is the same as that found by Senovilla, it is
dictated by the very possibility to have the double layer, but the jump in the
normal derivative of the radius may be not zero. It was found that in the
presence of the double layer, the matching conditions contain an arbitrary
function, and this result is quite new and very important. One of the
consequences of such freedom is that the trace of the extrinsic curvature
tensor of the singular hypersurface is necessarily equal to zero. We suggested
the physical interpretation for the $S_0^n$ and $S_n^n$ components of the
surface matter energy-momentum tensor of the shell. In General Relativity they
are zero by virtue of the Einstein equations. In the quadratic gravity they are
not necessarily zero. Our interpretation is that these components describe the
energy flow $(S^{0n})$ and the momentum transfer $(S^{nn})$ of the particles
produced by the double layer itself. Moreover, the requirement of the zero
trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor (mentioned above) implies that
$S_n^n=0$, and this fact also support our suggestion, because it means that for
the observer sitting on the shell, the particles will be seen created by pairs,
and the sum of their momentum transfers must zero. We derived also the matching
conditions for the null hypersurface, and this is, again, quite new. We found
that the null-double layer in the Weyl$+$ Einstein gravity does not exist at
all.

weights, which strongly affect stability and robustness of the quadrature rule.
Specifically, we investigate conditions that are needed to guarantee that the

weights are positive in the univariate case if the design points locally
minimise the posterior integral variance and the covariance kernel is totally
positive (e.g., Gaussian and Hardy kernels). This suggests that gradient-based
optimisation of design points may be effective in constructing stable and
robust Bayesian quadrature rules. Secondly, we show that magnitudes of the
weights admit an upper bound in terms of the fill distance and separation
radius if the RKHS of the kernel is a Sobolev space (e.g., Mat\'ern kernels),
suggesting that quasi-uniform points should be used. A number of numerical
examples demonstrate that significant generalisations and improvements appear
to be possible, manifesting the need for further research.

the stellar evolutionary code MESA to simulate the evolution of two stellar

above the iron core just before core collapse. Just above the iron core there
is a thin zone with convective shells. We assume that a dynamo in these
convective shells amplifies magnetic fields and forms magnetic flux loops. By
considering the buoyancy of magnetic flux loops we show that the steep entropy
rise in the radiative zone above the dynamo can prevent buoyancy of flux loops
with magnetic fields below about 10^{13}G. When this radiative zone collapses
on to the newly born neutron star the converging inflow further amplifies the
magnetic fields by a factor of about a hundred. After passing through the
stalled shock at about a hundred kilometres from the center, these strong
magnetic fields together with instabilities can facilitate the launching of
jets that explode the star in the frame of the jittering jets explosion
mechanism. Our study further supports the claim for the necessity to include
magnetic fields in simulating the explosion of CCSNe.

outputs of elliptic boundary value problems (BVPs) with parametrized random and

a large block-structured linear system of equations. We propose a stochastic
Galerkin reduced basis (SGRB) method as a means to lower the computational
burden when statistical outputs are required for a large number of
deterministic parameter queries. Our working assumption is that we have access
to the computational resources necessary to set up such a reduced order model
for a spatial-stochastic weak formulation of the parameter-dependent BVP.
  To derive an SGRB model, we project the spatial-stochastic weak solution of a
parameter-dependent SGFE model onto a POD reduced basis generated from
snapshots of SGFE solutions at representative values of the parameter. We
propose residual-corrected estimates of the parameter-dependent expectation and
variance of linear functional outputs and provide respective computable error
bounds.~We test the SGRB method numerically for a convection-diffusion-reaction
problem, choosing the convective velocity as a deterministic parameter and the
parametrized reactivity field as a random input. Compared to a standard reduced
basis model embedded in a Monte Carlo sampling procedure, the SGRB model
requires a similar number of reduced basis functions to meet a given tolerance
requirement. However, only a single run of the SGRB model suffices to estimate
a statistical output for a new deterministic parameter value, while the
standard reduced basis model must be solved for each Monte Carlo sample.

no simple roots. Their Cartan datum encodes the topology of a one-dimensional
real space and can be thought of as a generalization of a quiver, where
vertices are replaced by connected intervals. For these Lie algebras, we prove
an analogue of the Gabber-Kac-Serre theorem, providing a complete set of
defining relations featuring only quadratic Serre relations. Moreover, we
provide an alternative realization as continuum colimits of symmetric
Borcherds-Kac-Moody algebras with at most isotropic simple roots. The approach

promising rough volatility model in quantitative finance. It is a parsimonious
model depending on only three parameters, and yet remarkably fits with
empirical implied volatility surfaces. In the absence of analytical European
option pricing methods for the model, and due to the non-Markovian nature of
the fractional driver, the prevalent option is to use the Monte Carlo (MC)
simulation for pricing. Despite recent advances in the MC method in this
context, pricing under the rBergomi model is still a time-consuming task. To
overcome this issue, we have designed a novel, hierarchical approach, based on
i) adaptive sparse grids quadrature (ASGQ), and ii) quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC).
Both techniques are coupled with a Brownian bridge construction and a
Richardson extrapolation on the weak error. By uncovering the available
regularity, our hierarchical methods demonstrate substantial computational
gains with respect to the standard MC method, when reaching a sufficiently
small relative error tolerance in the price estimates across different
parameter constellations, even for very small values of the Hurst parameter.
Our work opens a new research direction in this field, i.e., to investigate the
performance of methods other than Monte Carlo for pricing and calibrating under
the rBergomi model.

sensitivities can approach $10^{-29}$~e$\cdot$cm. The challenge will be to
reduce systematic errors to similar levels. The ring will be adjusted to
preserve the spin polarization, initially parallel to the particle velocity,

the EDM, will rotate the polarization ($\vec d \times\vec E$). The slow rise in
the vertical polarization component, detected through scattering from a target,
signals the EDM. The project strategy is outlined. It foresees a step-wise
plan, starting with ongoing COSY activities that demonstrate technical

errors, long horizontal-plane polarization lifetimes, and control of the
polarization direction through feedback from the scattering measurements. The
project continues with a proof-of-capability measurement (precursor experiment;

direct method which extracts eigenenergies from the plateaux of the temporal
correlator and the HAL QCD method which extracts observables from the non-local
potential associated with the tempo-spatial correlator. Although the two
methods should give the same results theoretically, qualitatively different
results have been reported. Recently, we pointed out that the separation of the
ground state from the excited states is crucial to obtain sensible results in
the former, while both states provide useful signals in the latter. In this
paper, we identify the contribution of each state in the direct method by
decomposing the two-baryon correlators into the finite-volume eigenmodes
obtained from the HAL QCD method. We consider the $\Xi\Xi$ system in the
$^1$S$_0$ channel at $m_\pi = 0.51$ GeV in 2+1 flavor lattice QCD using the
wall and smeared quark sources. We demonstrate that the ""pseudo-plateau"" at
early time slices (t = 1~2 fm) from the smeared source in the direct method
indeed originates from the contamination of the excited states, and the true
plateau with the ground state saturation is realized only at t > 5~15 fm
corresponding to the inverse of the lowest excitation energy. We also
demonstrate that the two-baryon operator can be optimized by utilizing the
finite-volume eigenmodes, so that (i) the finite-volume energy spectra from the
HAL QCD method agree with those from the optimized temporal correlator and (ii)
the correct spectra would be accessed in the direct method only if highly
optimized operators are employed. Thus we conclude that the long-standing issue
on the consistency between the L\""uscher's finite volume method and the HAL QCD
method for two baryons is now resolved: They are consistent with each other
quantitatively only if the excited contamination is properly removed in the
former.

to understand their impact on electronic properties and sensing of these gas

defects and noticed that selenium vacancy is the most stable among other
defects. The adsorption of gas molecules is evaluated in terms of adsorption
energy, vertical height, charge difference density, Bader charge analysis,
electronic and magnetic properties. The maximum adsorption energy for H2S, NH3,
NO2 and NO molecules on pristine Janus MoSSe monolayer are ~ -0.156eV,
-0.203eV, -0.252eV, and -0.117eV, respectively. Selenium and sulfur/selenium
defects significantly improve the sensing of the gas molecules. NO2 gas
molecule dissociates and forms oxygen doped NO adsorption in selenium and
sulfur/selenium defect included MoSSe Janus monolayer. The adsorption energy
values are ~ -3.360eV and -3.404eV for Se and S/Se defects included MoSSe

1/mu/B magnetic moment. In contrast, NO molecule showed chemisorption on the

on the level of medium-size fluctuations, as the multifractal cross-correlation
analysis carried out by means of the multifractal cross-correlation analysis

of such cross-correlations is however varying among the financial instruments.
The strongest ties to the oil characterize currencies of the oil extracting

oil market trend. In the analysed time period the level of cross-correlations
systematically increases during the bear phase on the oil market and it
saturates after the trend reversal in 1st half of 2016. The same methodology is
also applied to identify possible causal relations between considered

framework connecting few-mode system-bath models to ab initio theory. We first
present a method to derive exact few-mode Hamiltonians for non-interacting
quantum potential scattering problems and demonstrate how to rigorously
reconstruct the scattering matrix from such few-mode Hamiltonians. We show that
upon inclusion of a background scattering contribution, an ab initio version of
the well known input-output formalism is equivalent to standard scattering
theory. On the basis of these exact results for non-interacting systems, we
construct an effective few-mode expansion scheme for interacting theories,
which allows to extract the relevant degrees of freedom from a continuum in an
open quantum system. As a whole, our results demonstrate that few-mode as well
as input-output models can be extended to a general class of problems, and open
up the associated toolbox to be applied to various platforms and extreme
regimes. We outline differences of the ab initio results to standard model
assumptions, which may lead to qualitatively different effects in certain
regimes. The formalism is exemplified in various simple physical scenarios. In
the process we provide proof-of-concept of the method, demonstrate important

photometry from the UV to the near-infrared at HST resolution, we derive
spatially resolved maps of galaxies properties, such as stellar mass and star
formation rate and specific star formation rate, with a resolution of $\sim
0.16$ arcsec. We find that the star formation activity is centrally enhanced in
galaxies above the MS and centrally suppressed below the MS, with quiescent
galaxies (1 dex below the MS) characterised by the highest suppression. The
sSFR in the outer region does not show systematic trends of enhancement or
suppression above or below the MS. The distribution of mass in MS galaxies
indicates that bulges are growing when galaxies are still on the MS relation.
Galaxies below the MS are more bulge-dominated with respect to MS counterparts
at fixed stellar mass, while galaxies in the upper envelope are more extended
and have S\'ersic indexes that are always smaller than or comparable to their
MS counterparts. The suppression of star formation activity in the central

critical transition temperature = 12.0 $\pm$ 0.2 K which is found to be equal
to T_c2. The critical exponents are close to those associated with the
universality class of tricritical mean field model. The absence of a model with
which the exponents correspond with directly, suggests the presence of large
critical fluctuations in this system. The critical fluctuations in this system
are sensitive to the applied magnetic field, which leads to field dependence of
boundaries in the magnetic phase diagram. With increasing T the magnetic
domains disintegrate into finger-like patterns before fragmenting into disjoint
magnetized puddles at T^*_c1 and ultimately disappearing at T*. At T^*_c1 we
observe a significant increase in the spatial inhomogeneity of the local

one-dimensional ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose gas. Preparing the system in a
far-from-equilibrium initial state, simultaneous coarsening and refining is
found to enable and characterize the approach to a non-thermal fixed point. A
macroscopic length scale which scales in time according to $L_{\Lambda}(t)\sim
t^{\, \beta}$, with $\beta\simeq 1/4$, quantifies the coarsening of the size of
spin textures. At the same time kink-like defects populating these textures
undergo a refining process measured by a shrinking microscopic length scale
$L_{\lambda}\sim t^{\, \beta'}$, with $\beta'\simeq-0.17$. The combination of
these scaling evolutions enables particle and energy conservation in the
isolated system and constitutes a bi-directional transport in momentum space.
The value of the coarsening exponent $\beta$ suggests the dynamics to belong to
the universality class of diffusive coarsening of the one-dimensional XY-model.
However, the universal momentum distribution function exhibiting non-linear
transport marks the distinction between diffusive coarsening and the approach
of a non-thermal fixed point in the isolated system considered here. This
underlines the importance of the universal scaling function in classifying
non-thermal fixed points. Present-day experiments with quantum gases are

pulsed neutron and muon source has been in operation since 1999 and its novel
use of a large array of position-sensitive neutron detectors paved the way for
a later generations of chopper spectrometers around the world. Almost two
decades of experience of user operations on MAPS, together with lessons learned
from the operation of new generation instruments, led to a decision to perform
three parallel upgrades to the instrument. These were to replace the primary
beamline collimation with supermirror neutron guides, to install a disk
chopper, and to modify the geometry of the poisoning in the water moderator
viewed by MAPS. Together these upgrades were expected to increase the neutron
flux substantially, to allow more flexible use of repetition rate
multiplication and to reduce some sources of background. Here we report the
details of these upgrades, and compare the performance of the instrument before
and after their installation, as well as to Monte Carlo simulations. These
illustrate that the instrument is performing in line with, and in some respects
in excess of, expectations. It is anticipated that the improvement in
performance will have a significant impact on the capabilities of the
instrument. A few examples of scientific commissioning are presented to
illustrate some of the possibilities.

functions that include all interparticle distances have suffered so far from
the lack of size-consistency resulting from the difficulty to define monomer
energies corresponding to the applied dimer basis. As a consequence it has not
been possible to obtain interaction energies vanishing at infinite intermonomer
distance $R$. This has dramatically reduced the accuracy of calculations at
distances where the error in the dimer energy was comparable with the
interaction energy itself. The same problem occurs in calculations of
interaction-induced properties. In this communication we show how to circumvent
this difficulty and obtain interaction energies or interaction-induced
properties that vanish at large $R$. This is achieved by relaxing the Pauli
principle in the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of noninteracting monomers.
The basis functions used for this diagonalization belong to the representation
of the permutation group of the dimer induced by the product of representations
appropriate for the monomer spin states. Nonlinear parameters of the basis set
are optimized only for the dimer in the Pauli-allowed sector of the Hilbert
space. In this way, one obtains $R$-dependent energy of noninteracting monomers
and the corresponding interaction energy includes a counterpoise correction for
the basis set superposition error. The efficiency of this procedure is
demonstrated for the interaction of two hydrogen atoms where accurate reference
data are known.

In chapter 4 I study two recents experiments about hydrodynamics of light in

future project of my group at LKB.
  The main goal of this manuscript is to provide the tools to connect
non-linear and quantum optics to quantum fluids of light. Because the physics
of matter quantum fluids and fluids of light has long been the territory of
condensed matter physicists, it is uncommon to find textbooks which draw the
analogies with quantum optics. I have taken the reverse trajectory, being
trained as a quantum optician and moving progressively to quantum gases and
quantum fluids of light. Naturally, I try to use the concepts and resources
developed by the quantum optics community to improve experiment about fluids of
light, but I also reverse the approach and ask a very simple question: what
does the concept of fluid of light bring to our understanding of non-linear and
quantum optics ? It can be rephrased as an operational question: which new
effects can we predict (and possibly observe) using the photon fluid formalism
?

on energy-efficient access network design. The optical network units (ONUs),
being predominantly responsible for the energy consumption of Ethernet Passive
Optical Network (EPON), motivates us towards designing a novel protocol for
saving energy at ONU. The proposed protocol exploits different low power modes
(LPM) and opts for the suitable one using traffic prediction. This scheme
provides a significant improvement of energy-efficiency especially at high load
(~ 40%) over existing protocols. A better understanding of the performance and
a deeper insight into several design aspects can only be addressed through a
detailed mathematical analysis. The proposed protocol involves traffic
prediction which infringes Markovian property. However, some pragmatic
assumptions along with a proper selection of observation instances and state
descriptions allow us to form a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) of the
proposed algorithm. Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to propose a
novel scheme for achieving energy-efficiency at ONU and mathematically analyze
the performance of it with the help of a DTMC. The analysis reveals that the
energy-efficiency is more sensitive to the power consumption of doze mode as

dispersive sensing has been proposed as the readout mechanism for future
topological qubits, which can be measured by single electrons tunneling through
zero-energy modes. The development of such a readout requires resolving the
coherent charge tunneling amplitude from a quantum dot in a Majorana-zero-mode
host system faithfully on short time scales. Here, we demonstrate rapid
single-shot detection of a coherent single-electron tunneling amplitude between
InAs nanowire quantum dots. We have realized a sensitive dispersive detection
circuit by connecting a sub-GHz, lumped element microwave resonator to a
high-lever arm gate on one of dots. The resulting large dot-resonator coupling
leads to an observed dispersive shift that is of the order of the resonator
linewidth at charge degeneracy. This shift enables us to differentiate between
Coulomb blockade and resonance, corresponding to the scenarios expected for
qubit state readout, with a signal to noise ratio exceeding 2 for an
integration time of 1 microsecond. Our result paves the way for single shot
measurements of fermion parity on microsecond timescales in topological qubits.

detectors with noise equivalent power (NEP) less than 1x10-19 W/Hz1/2 for
imaging applications and at least an order of magnitude lower for spectroscopic
studies. The detector NEP can be reduced by lowering the operation temperature
and improving the thermal isolation between the bolometer and a heat bath. We
report on the fabrication of membrane isolated transition edge sensor
bolometers incorporating compact (<50 {\mu}m) thermal isolation beams based on
phononic filters. Phononic filters are created by etching quasi-periodic
nanoscale structures into supporting thermo-mechanical beams. The
cross-sectional dimensions of the etched features are less than the thermal
wavelength at the operating temperature, enabling coherent phonon transport to
take place in one dimension. The phonon stop-band can be tuned by adjusting the
scale of the quasi-periodic structures. Cascading multiple filter stages can
increase bandwidth and provide improved thermal isolation similar to the
function of a multi-stage electrical filter. We describe the fabrication of
AlMn based transition edge sensor bolometers on silicon and silicon nitride
membranes isolated by one- and two-dimensional phononic filters. The phononic
filters are patterned through electron beam lithography and isolated with deep
reactive ion etching.

curvature ($\tilde R$) and in the Weyl tensor ($\tilde C_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$)
of the Weyl conformal geometry. In the absence of matter fields, this action
has spontaneous breaking in which the Weyl gauge field $\omega_\mu$ becomes
massive (mass $m_\omega\sim$ Planck scale) after ""eating"" the dilaton in the
$\tilde R^2$ term, in a Stueckelberg mechanism. As a result, one recovers the
Einstein-Hilbert action with a positive cosmological constant and the Proca
action for the massive Weyl gauge field $\omega_\mu$. Below $m_\omega$ this
field decouples and Weyl geometry becomes Riemannian. The Einstein-Hilbert
action is then just a ""low-energy"" limit of Weyl quadratic gravity which thus
avoids its previous, long-held criticisms. In the presence of matter scalar
field $\phi_1$ (Higgs-like), with couplings allowed by Weyl gauge symmetry,
after its spontaneous breaking one obtains in addition, at low scales, a Higgs
potential with spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking. This is induced by
the non-minimal coupling $\xi_1\phi_1^2 \tilde R$ to Weyl geometry, with Higgs
mass $\propto\xi_1/\xi_0$ ($\xi_0$ is the coefficient of the $\tilde R^2$
term). In realistic models $\xi_1$ must be classically tuned $\xi_1\ll \xi_0$.
We comment on the quantum stability of this value.

the basis of synchronization phenomena, metamaterial formation, nonreciprocal
behavior and topological effects. Such systems are typically explored using
optical or microwave resonators. In recent years, mechanical resonators have
entered the stage as universal building block for resonator networks, both for
their well-controlled mechanical properties and for their eigenfrequencies
conveniently located in the radio-frequency regime. Vertically oriented
nanomechanical pillar resonators are ideally suited for the dense integration
into large resonator networks. However, to realize the potential of these
promising systems, an intrinsic coupling mechanism needs to be established.
Here, we demonstrate strain-induced, strong coupling between two adjacent
nanomechanical pillar resonators. The coupling is mediated through the strain
distribution in the joint substrate caused by the flexural vibration of the
pillars, such that the coupling strength can be controlled by the geometric
properties of the nanopillars as well as their separation. Both, mode
hybridization and the formation of an avoided level crossing in the response of
the nanopillar pair are experimentally observed. The coupling mechanism is
readily scalable to large arrays of nanopillars, enabling all-mechanical
resonator networks for the investigation of a broad range of collective
dynamical phenomena.

transform PDEs with boundary conditions into unconstrained optimization
problems by embedding the boundary conditions into a ""constrained expression.""
In this work, a neural network is chosen as the free function, and used to
solve the now unconstrained optimization problem. The loss function is taken as
the square of the residual of the PDE. Then, the neural network is trained in
an unsupervised manner to solve the unconstrained optimization problem. This
methodology has two major differences when compared with popular methods used
to estimate the solutions of PDEs. First, this methodology does not need to
discretize the domain into a grid, rather, this methodology randomly samples
points from the domain during the training phase. Second, after training, this
methodology represents a closed form, analytical, differentiable approximation
of the solution throughout the entire training domain. In contrast, other
popular methods require interpolation if the estimated solution is desired at
points that do not lie on the discretized grid. The deep TFC method for
estimating the solution of PDEs is demonstrated on four problems with a variety
of boundary conditions.

the complications of using the conventional TPE methods that are dependent on
sensor model and propose a new data-driven method that overcomes these
challenges. The proposed method consists of a regression model that takes FBG
wavelength raw data as input and directly estimates the CDM's tip position.
This model is pre-operatively (off-line) trained on position information from
optical trackers/cameras (as the ground truth) and it intra-operatively
(on-line) estimates CDM tip position using only the FBG wavelength data. The
method's performance is evaluated on a CDM developed for orthopedic
applications, and the results are compared to conventional model-dependent
methods during large deflection bendings. Mean absolute TPE error (and standard

3.63 mm and 0.62 mm for the conventional and the proposed data-driven

caused by the neutrino interaction with matter polarized by external magnetic
field (or, equivalently, by the interaction of the induced magnetic moment
(IMM) of a neutrino with the magnetic field). In the analysis, we consider
realistic conditions inside supernovae and discuss both the Dirac and Majorana
cases. We show that due to the interaction with the polarized matter a neutrino
flux from a supernova suffers additional attenuation at low neutrino energies.
Another possible effect is that when taken together the effects of conventional
magnetic moment and polarized matter can cancel each other so that under
certain condition the oscillations disappear. We note that this can lead to the
appearance of a characteristic maximum in the spectrum of electron neutrinos
from supernovae. Accounting for neutrino mixing (in the two-flavor
approximation) can significantly increase (almost twice) the effective value of
the IMM of the electron neutrino. As a result, electron neutrinos with twice as
high energy will be able to participate in the processes of spin conversion.
Various feedback mechanisms accompanying the considered phenomena are also
discussed.

recent years. In this paper, we extend the basic equilateral four-body problem
by introducing the effect of radiation pressure, Poynting-Robertson drag, and
solar wind drag. In our setup, three primaries lay at the vertices of an
equilateral triangle and move in circular orbits around their common center of
mass. Here, one of the primaries is a radiating body and the fourth body (whose
mass is negligible) does not affect the motion of the primaries. We show that
the existence and the number of equilibrium points of the problem depend on the
mass parameters and radiation factor. Consequently, the allowed regions of
motion, the regions of the basins of convergence for the equilibrium points,
and the basin entropy will also depend on these parameters. The present
dynamical model is analyzed for three combinations of mass for the primaries:
equal masses, two equal masses, different masses. As the main results, we find
that in all cases the libration points are unstable if the radiation factor is
larger than 0.01 and hence able to destroy the stability of the libration
points in the restricted four-body problem composed by Sun, Jupiter, Trojan
asteroid and a test (dust) particle. Also, we conclude that the number of fixed
points decreases with the increase of the radiation factor.

frequency-domain surrogate version of the aligned-spin binary neutron star
waveform model using the effective one body formalism known as SEOBNRv4T. This
model includes the quadrupolar and octopolar adiabatic and dynamical tides. The
version presented here is improved by the inclusion of the spin-induced
quadrupole moment effect, and completed by a prescription for tapering the end
of the waveform to qualitatively reproduce numerical relativity simulations.
The resulting model has 14 intrinsic parameters. We reduce its dimensionality
by using universal relations that approximate all matter effects in terms of
the leading quadrupolar tidal parameters. The implementation of the time-domain
model can take up to an hour to evaluate using a starting frequency of 20Hz,
and this is too slow for many parameter estimation codes that require $O(10^7)$
sequential waveform evaluations. We therefore construct a fast and faithful
frequency-domain surrogate of this model using Gaussian process regression. The
resulting surrogate has a maximum mismatch of $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ for the
Advanced LIGO detector, and requires 0.13s to evaluate for a waveform with a
starting frequency of 20Hz. Finally, we perform an end-to-end test of the
surrogate with a set of parameter estimation runs, and find that the surrogate
accurately recovers the parameters of injected waveforms.

solve the inverse problem of designing the number, size, and orientation of
cuts that allows us to convert a closed, compact regular kirigami tessellation
of the plane into a deployment that conforms approximately to any prescribed
target shape in two and three dimensions. We do this by first identifying the
constraints on the lengths and angles of generalized kirigami tessellations
which guarantee that their reconfigured face geometries can be contracted from
a non-trivial deployed shape to a novel planar cut pattern. We encode these
conditions in a flexible constrained optimization framework which allows us to
deform the geometry of periodic kirigami tesselations with three, four, and
sixfold symmetry, among others, into generalized kirigami patterns that deploy
to a wide variety of prescribed boundary target shapes. Physically fabricated
models verify our inverse design approach and allow us to determine the tunable
material response of the resulting structures. We then extend our framework to
create generalized kirigami patterns that deploy to approximate curved surfaces
in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Altogether, this work illustrates a novel framework for
designing complex, shape-changing sheets from simple cuts showing the power of

is a slowly decreasing function of the ratio of the scalar and gauge

approximately in proportion to the square of the string tension, with
additional O(1) correction factors which asymptote to constants below $\beta

current CMB bounds at higher symmetry-breaking scales. This is particularly
relevant for models where the gauge symmetry is broken in a supersymmetric flat

Lext, characteristic of the system size. If such a dependence exists it is
surprising that it does not show up in the study of wavenumber spectra, where
the different physical systems suggest that Lext can vary by up to five orders

guaranteeing that no information is leaked by the joint processing of
non-sensitive data (in clear-text) and sensitive data (in encrypted form). QB
maps a query to a set of queries over the sensitive and non-sensitive data in a
way that no leakage will occur due to the joint processing over sensitive and

that QB actually strengthens the security of the underlying cryptographic

study Nickel Oxide quantitatively and find perfect agreement with the
qualitative analysis, thereby highlighting the strength of the former. We find
that there are two distinct features of antiferromagnetic magnon-polarons which
differ from the ferromagnetic ones. First, hybridization between magnons and
the longitudinal phonon modes is expected in many cubic antiferromagnetic
structures. Second, we find that the very existence of certain hybridizations
can be controlled via an external magnetic field, an effect which comes in
addition to the ability to move the magnon modes relative to the phonons modes.

objects the interpretation of the observation by ZV. Notice that SN objection

the conclusion made with a sub-set of data (4 percent) is statistically not

behaviour of cancer. At this stage, such a rather ubiquitous cancer periodicity
makes any discussion of a small subset of data at least secondarily. Further,
we show here that the 88 days Melanoma periodicity is not related to solar
activity. Planetary lensing of streaming low speed invisible massive particles
remains the only viable explanation, as it has been introduced previously with
a number of physics observations [4]. We also show that planetary lensing of
low speed particles cannot be considered in isolation, because of the
dominating Sun gravity, at least for the inner planets. Interestingly,
gravitational lensing - deflection favours low speed particles.

primary production is of importance to a variety of ecological topics. Since
CO2 increases primary production in laboratory experiments, the global effects
of increasing CO2 on global primary production are of interest in both climate
science and ecology. Various studies have considered increases in primary
production over different regions and time scales, but the global effects of
increased atmospheric CO2 and primary production remain unquantified. This
study aims to compare these two variables globally to assist in determining the
potential for increases in primary production to contribute to carbon
sequestration, possibly slowing increases in atmospheric CO2 resulting from
fossil fuel emissions. Monthly CO2 concentration data from 1985 through 2015 in
distinct latitude bands (every 10 degrees) was retrieved from the NOAA Earth
System Research Laboratory for a total of 18 datasets. As a proxy to quantify
net primary production, the magnitude of annual CO2 cycling was computed for
each dataset through Fourier analysis. Relative increases were then calculated
for both CO2 increase and amplitude increase to compare the pace of carbon
cycling with the pace of increases in atmospheric CO2. Globally, the increase
in primary production determined by using annual CO2 cycling as a proxy was
3.75% (+/- 1.82%) per decade over the time interval studied. In contrast, the
measured increase in CO2 abundance was 4.75% (+/- 0.02%) per decade. Increases
in carbon cycling appear to be slightly smaller than increases in CO2 globally
and in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, but the uncertainties in the
estimate for increases in carbon cycling are too large to draw that conclusion
with statistical confidence.

Their rigorous analytic proof shows that if the lowest slope of flows can be

Whitham-type equation. Since this breakthrough, there have been numerous
refined wave-breaking results established by generalizing the kernel which
describes the dispersion relation of water waves. Even though the proofs of
these involve a system of coupled Riccati-type differential inequalities,
however, little or no attention has been made to a generalization of this
Riccati-type system. In this work, from a rich class of non-local conservation
laws, a Riccati-type system that governs the flow's gradient is extracted and
investigated. The system's leading coefficient functions are allowed to change
their values and signs over time as opposed to the ones in many of other
previous works are fixed constants. Up to the author's knowledge, the blow-up
analysis upon this structural generalization is new and is of theoretical
interest in itself as well as its application to various non-local flow models.
The theory is illustrated via the Whitham-type equation with nonlinear drift.
Our method is applicable to a large class of non-local conservation laws.

Theorem states that $E(K) = E(K)_{tors} \times Z^r$, where $r$ is the rank of
$E$, and $E(K)_{tors}$ is the torsion subgroup, i.e. the group of points of
finite order in $E(K)$. The group $E(K)_{tors}$ is finite and well understood.
So, one tries to find a way to determine the rank $r$ of $E$, which is the
major problem. The procedure described in this thesis shows how to transfer the
computation of the weak Mordell-Weil group $E(K)/mE(K)$ to the existence or
non-existence of a rational point on certain curves, called homogeneous spaces.
If one can find some completion $K_v$ of $K$ such that the homogeneous space
has no points in $K_v$, then it follows that it has no points in $K$. Under the
assumption that the Shafarevich-Tate group is finite, the rank of Elliptic
curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with $j$-invariant $1728$ is fully determined in
certain cases.

particle from the potential well, a common pattern is observed. Namely, the
minimal forcing amplitude required for the escape exhibits sharp minimum for
the excitation frequency below the natural frequency of small oscillations in
the well. The paper explains this regularity by exploring the transient escape
dynamics in simple benchmark potential wells. In the truncated parabolic well,
in absence of the damping the minimal forcing amplitude obviously tends to zero
for the natural excitation frequency. Addition of weak symmetric softening
nonlinearity to the truncated parabolic well leads to the nonzero forcing
minimum below the natural frequency. We explicitly compute this shift in the
principal approximation by considering the slow-flow dynamics in conditions of
the principal 1:1 resonance. Essentially nonlinear model, analyzed with the

linkage at every step. However, in order to provide adaptive,
density-consistent and flexible solutions, we study extracting all the reliable
linkages at each step, instead of the smallest one. Such a strategy can be
applied with all common criteria for agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We
also study that this strategy with the single linkage criterion yields a
minimum spanning tree algorithm. We perform experiments on several real-world
datasets to demonstrate the performance of this strategy compared to the
standard alternative.

present a framework for lattice pattern representation and comparison, and
propose an efficient algorithm for lattice separation. We define new scale and
shape descriptors, which helps to considerably reduce the size of equivalence
classes of lattice bases. These finitely many equivalence relations are fully
characterized by modular group theory. We construct the lattice space
$\mathscr{L}$ based on the equivalent descriptors and define a metric
$d_{\mathscr{L}}$ to accurately quantify the visual similarities and
differences between lattices. Furthermore, we introduce the Lattice
Identification and Separation Algorithm (LISA), which identifies each lattice
patterns from superposed lattices. LISA finds lattice candidates from the high
responses in the image spectrum, then sequentially extracts different layers of
lattice patterns one by one. Analyzing the frequency components, we reveal the
intricate dependency of LISA's performances on particle radius, lattice
density, and relative translations. Various numerical experiments are designed
to show LISA's robustness against a large number of lattice layers, moir\'{e}
patterns and missing particles.

important nowadays. Teamwork is often used for decision-making processes and
for solving complex problems. Research in this area focuses on the
quantification and analysis of behavior within and between groups. By using
wearable electronic devices, such as badges, this quantification can be
performed automatically and with high accuracy. The goal of this work is the
design and implementation of a new firmware for the badges of the Rhythm
project - an open-source project of the Human Dynamics Group of the MIT Media
Lab. The firmware is characterized by a modular and extensible architecture and
combines different techniques. These include a filesystem, which efficiently
stores sequentially generated data based on a virtual memory abstraction, a
serialization library, which enables a platform-independent exchange of
structured data, and a time synchronization technique, which compensates
frequency deviations of the oscillator. In addition, an automated test
environment was designed for the verification of individual functional software
components of the application. As a result of detailed analysis and special
measures, the power consumption could be significantly reduced compared to the
previous implementation. Due to the hierarchical and modular structure and the
high degree of abstraction, the developed techniques can also be integrated
into other projects and platforms.

operations (AVX2 and AVX-512 instructions), as these instructions increase
power consumption. The frequency is only increased again two milliseconds after
the last code section containing such instructions has been executed in order
to prevent excessive numbers of frequency changes. Due to this delay,
intermittent use of wide vector operations can slow down the rest of the system
significantly. For example, previous work has shown the performance of web
servers to be reduced by up to 10% if the SSL library uses AVX-512 vector
instructions. These performance variations are hard to predict during software
development as the performance impact of vectorization depends on the specific
workload.
  We describe a mechanism to reduce the slowdown caused by wide vector
instructions without requiring extensive changes to existing software. Our
design allows the developer to mark problematic AVX code regions. The scheduler
then restricts execution of this code to a subset of the cores so that only
these cores' frequency is affected. Threads are automatically migrated to a
suitable core whenever necessary. We identify a suitable load balancing policy
to ensure good utilization of all available cores. Our approach is able to
reduce the performance variability caused by AVX2 and AVX-512 instructions by
over 70%.

non dematerialised technique to cover a significant, well-identified and
unavoidable risk. However, research has shown that a verifiable dematerialized
vote intrinsically loses its anonymity. In addition, a study of the history of

guarantee the anonymity of its connection and that personal voting data has
always been potentially exposed. Electronic voting systems are therefore, to
the best of our knowledge, unable to provide the required constitutional

forces, and were detected in 1947. Today they are known to be bound states of
quarks and anti-quarks of the two lightest flavours. They satisfy Bose
statistics, and are the lightest particles of the strong interaction spectrum.
Determination of the parameters of the Standard Model, including the masses of
the lightest quarks, has only recently reached high precision on the lattice.
Pions are also known to be pseudo-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken
approximate axial-vector symmetries, and a probe of their properties and
interactions at high precision tests our knowledge of the strong interactions.
While also being a probe of the solution of the strong interactions on the
computer, which is known as lattice gauge theory. Despite their long history,
there are significant experimental and theoretical challenges in determining
their properties at high precision. Examples include the lifetime of the
neutral pion, and the status of their masses and decay widths in effective
field theories. Pion-pion scattering has been studied for several decades using
general methods of field theory such as dispersion relations based on
analyticity, unitarity and crossing. Knowledge from these theoretical methods
are used to confront high precision experimental data, and to analyze them to
extract information on their scattering and phase shift parameters. This
knowledge is crucial for estimating the Standard Model contributions to the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, which is being probed at Fermilab in
ongoing experiments. Other sensitive tests include the rare decay of the eta
meson into three pions, which represents an isospin violating decay. The
present article briefly reviews these important developments.

  Materials under Shock Loading",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Initiation in heterogeneous energetic material (HEM) subjected to shock
loading occurs due to the formation of hot spots. The criticality of the hot
spots governs the initiation and sensitivity of HEMs. In porous energetic
materials, collapse of pores under impact leads to the formation of hot spots.
Depending on the size and strength of the hot spots chemical reaction can
initiate. The criticality of the hot spots is dependent on the imposed shock
load, void morphology and the type of energetic material. This work evaluates
the relative importance of material constitutive and reactive properties on the
criticality condition of spots. Using a scaling-based approach, the criticality
criterion for cylindrical voids as a function of shock pressure, Ps and void
diameter, Dvoid is obtained for two different energetic material HMX and TATB.
It is shown that the criticality of different energetic materials is
significantly dependent on their reactive properties.
