images with generic content. However, few approaches have been specifically
designed to predict the aesthetic quality of images containing human faces,
which make up a massive portion of photos in the web. This paper introduces a
method for aesthetic quality assessment of images with faces. We exploit three
different Convolutional Neural Networks to encode information regarding
perceptual quality, global image aesthetics, and facial attributes; then, a
model is trained to combine these features to explicitly predict the aesthetics
of images containing faces. Experimental results show that our approach
outperforms existing methods for both binary, i.e. low/high, and continuous
aesthetic score prediction on four different databases in the state-of-the-art.

because it is very small compared to the linear polarization. It could,
however, provide information on a planet's atmosphere and surface, and on the
presence of life, because homochiral molecules that are the building blocks of
life on Earth are known to reflect circularly polarized light.
  We compute $P_c$, the degree of circular polarization, for light that is
reflected by rocky (exo)planets with liquid water or sulfuric acid solution
clouds, both spatially resolved across the planetary disk and, for planets with
patchy clouds, integrated across the planetary disk, for various planetary
phase angles $\alpha$.
  The optical thickness and vertical distribution of the atmospheric gas and
clouds, the size parameter and refractive index of the cloud particles, and
$\alpha$ all influence $P_c$. Spatially resolved, $P_c$ varies between $\pm
0.20\%$ (the sign indicates the polarization direction). Only for small gas
optical thicknesses above the clouds do significant sign changes (related to
cloud particle properties) across the planets' hemispheres occur. For patchy
clouds, the disk--integrated $P_c$ is typically smaller than $\pm 0.025\%$,
with maximums for $\alpha$ between $40^\circ$ and $70^\circ$, and $120^\circ$
to $140^\circ$. As expected, the disk--integrated $P_c$ is virtually zero at
$\alpha=0^\circ$ and 180$^\circ$. The disk--integrated $P_c$ is also very small
at $\alpha \approx 100^\circ$.
  Measuring circular polarization signals appears to be challenging with
current technology. The small atmospheric circular polarization signal could,
however, allow the detection of circular polarization due to homochiral
molecules. Confirmation of the detectability of such signals requires better
knowledge of the strength of circular polarization signals of biological
sources.

the difference between quantum and classical physics is the way their physical
assumptions augment bare probability theory: Classical physics corresponds to a
trivial augmentation---one just applies the Law of Total Probability (LTP)

expressed in one or another of the forms of our general procedure. To mark the
irreducible difference between quantum and classical, one should seek the

least two senses---the first to do with unitarily invariant distance measures
between the rules, and the second to do with available volume in a reference
probability simplex (roughly speaking a new kind of uncertainty principle).
Both of these arise from a significant majorization result. This work

components of nano and molecular electronics. However, the fabrication of break
junctions remains notoriously time-consuming and difficult to parallelize. Here
we demonstrate true parallel fabrication of gold break junctions featuring
sub-3 nm gaps on the wafer-scale, by relying on a novel self-breaking mechanism
based on controlled crack formation in notched bridge structures. We achieve
fabrication densities as high as 7 million junctions per cm$^{2}$, with
fabrication yields of around 7% for obtaining crack-defined break junctions
with sub-3 nm gaps of fixed gap width that exhibit electron tunneling. We also
form molecular junctions using dithiol-terminated oligo(phenylene ethynylene)
(OPE3) to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for electrical probing of
molecules down to liquid helium temperatures. Our technology opens a whole new
range of experimental opportunities for nano and molecular electronics
applications, by enabling very large-scale fabrication of solid-state break
junctions.

characterise a large number of clusters over the entire sky. In this study we
aim to a establish list of members and derive mean parameters, in particular
distances, for as many clusters as possible, making use of Gaia data alone. We
compile a list of thousands of known or putative clusters from the literature.
We then apply an unsupervised membership assignment code, UPMASK, to the Gaia
DR2 data contained within the fields of those clusters. We obtained a list of
members and cluster parameters for 1229 clusters. As expected, the youngest
clusters are seen to be tightly distributed near the Galactic plane and to
trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way, while older objects are more uniformly
distributed, deviate further from the plane, and tend to be located at larger
Galactocentric distances. Thanks to the quality of GaiaDR2 astrometry, the
fully homogeneous parameters derived in this study are the most precise to

clusters in the fields analysed during this study.

an accuracy better than $1\%$ already using only standard sirens while, when

technologies, such as Cognitive Radio provides a promising solution to

communication rate, service, and security. A cognitive radio system will be
able to sense the availability of radio frequencies, analyze the condition of

select the best option out of the overwhelming amount of information, a channel
ranking mechanism can be employed. While several channel ranking techniques
have been proposed, most of them only consider the occupancy rate of the sensed
channels. However, there are other significantly important parameters that
provide information on the condition of channels and should also be considered
during the ranking process. This paper proposes a utility-based channel ranking
mechanism that takes into account signal-to-noise ratio and the occupancy rate
of the channels to determine their usefulness or preference. The paper at first
discusses the need for channel ranking and the involved process. Then the
suitability of different mathematical functions is investigated for utility
modeling of the channel based on its SNR and occupancy. Finally, results are
provided that show improved channel ranking compared to that of spectrum
occupancy based ranking.

Any subadditivity formula for singular varieties must have a correction term
that measures the singularities of that variety. Whereas earlier subadditivity
formulas accomplished this by multiplying by the Jacobian ideal, our approach
is to use the formalism of Cartier algebras. We also show that our
subadditivity containment is sharper than ones shown previously by Takagi and
Eisenstein. The first of these results follows from a Noether normalization
technique due to Hochster and Huneke. The second of these results is obtained
using ideas of Takagi and Eisenstein to show that the adjoint ideal
$\mathscr{J}_X(A, Z) $ reduces mod $p$ to Takagi's adjoint test ideal, even
when the ambient space is singular, provided that $A$ is regular at the generic
point of $X$. One difficulty of using this new subadditivity formula in
practice is the computational complexity of computing its correction term.
Thus, we discuss a combinatorial construction of the relevant Cartier algebra

  We have success proving algebraic results in the general setting of symmetric

rings, respectively. For example, we prove that modules over the semiring
category Fin of finite sets are cocartesian monoidal $\infty$-categories, and
modules over Burn (the Burnside $\infty$-category) are additive

categorical study of Lawvere theories. We prove that Lawvere theories function
as a home for an algebraic Yoneda lemma.
  Finally, we provide evidence for a formal duality between naive and genuine
equivariant homotopy theory, in the form of a group-theoretic Eilenberg-Watts
Theorem. This sets up a parallel between equivariant homotopy theory and
motivic homotopy theory, where Burnside constructions are analogous to Morita
theory. We conjecture that this relationship could be made precise within the
context of noncommutative motives over the field with one element.

recent market report, the computer software market is expected to continue
expanding at an accelerating speed, but the market supply of qualified software

text generation research works provides the opportunities to address such a
dilemma through automatic program synthesis. In this paper, we propose to make
our try to solve the program synthesis problem from a data mining perspective.
To address the problem, a novel generative model, namely EgoCoder, will be
introduced in this paper. EgoCoder effectively parses program code into
abstract syntax trees (ASTs), where the tree nodes will contain the program
code/comment content and the tree structure can capture the program logic
flows. Based on a new unit model called Hsu, EgoCoder can effectively capture
both the hierarchical and sequential patterns in the program ASTs. Extensive
experiments will be done to compare EgoCoder with the state-of-the-art text
generation methods, and the experimental results have demonstrated the
effectiveness of EgoCoder in addressing the program synthesis problem.

additionally provide information on the mean shape of subsets of a field. This
makes them ideal statistics to measure the anisotropic signal generated by
redshift space distortion in the low redshift matter density field. We review
the definition of the Minkowski tensor statistics in three dimensions, focusing
on two coordinate invariant quantities $W^{0,2}_{1}$ and $W^{0,2}_{2}$. We
calculate the ensemble average of these $3 \times 3$ matrices for an isotropic
Gaussian random field, finding that they are proportional to products of the

linear $\Lambda$CDM matter power spectrum. We then introduce anisotropy by
applying a linear redshift space distortion operator to the matter density

discuss the physical origin of this signal and how it can be used to constrain

strength of the blue-shift instability associated to the Cauchy horizon of

the $\Lambda=0$ case-the competition with the decay associated to the region
between the event and cosmological horizons is delicate. Of particular interest
is the question as to whether generic, admissible initial data posed on a
Cauchy surface lead to solutions whose local energy blows up at the Cauchy
horizon, for this statement holds in the $\Lambda = 0$ case and would
correspond precisely to the blow up required by Christodoulou's formulation of
strong cosmic censorship. Some recent heuristic work suggests that the answer
is in general negative for solutions arising from sufficiently smooth data,
such that for all such data, the arising solutions have finite local energy at
the Cauchy horizon. In this short note, we shall show in contrast that, by
slightly relaxing the smoothness assumption on initial data, we are able to
prove the analogue of the Christodoulou statement in the affirmative, i.e. we
show that for generic data in our allowed class, the local energy blow-up
statement indeed holds at the Cauchy horizon, for all subextremal black hole

of initial data is still sufficiently regular to ensure both stability and
decay properties in the region between the event and cosmological horizons as
well as the boundedness and continuous extendibility beyond the Cauchy horizon.
This suggests thus that it is finally this class which may provide the correct
setting to formulate the genericity condition in strong cosmic censorship.

Submitted to JRSSB",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Information criteria have had a profound impact on modern ecological science.
They allow researchers to estimate which probabilistic approximating models are
closest to the generating process. Unfortunately, information criterion
comparison does not tell how good the best model is. Nor do practitioners
routinely test the reliability (e.g. error rates) of information
criterion-based model selection. In this work, we show that these two
shortcomings can be resolved by extending a key observation from Hirotugu
Akaike's original work. Standard information criterion analysis considers only
the divergences of each model from the generating process. It is ignored that
there are also estimable divergence relationships amongst all of the
approximating models. We then show that using both sets of divergences, a model
space can be constructed that includes an estimated location for the generating
process. Thus, not only can an analyst determine which model is closest to the
generating process, she/he can also determine how close to the generating
process the best approximating model is. Properties of the generating process
estimated from these projections are more accurate than those estimated by
model averaging. The applications of our findings extend to all areas of
science where model selection through information criteria is done.

star-forming galaxies with $L\geq0.3\,L^*$ is consistent with unity inside one

growing data corpora. As this trend is only going to increase in the future,
distributed training schemes are becoming increasingly relevant. A major issue
in distributed training is the limited communication bandwidth between
contributing nodes or prohibitive communication cost in general. These
challenges become even more pressing, as the number of computation nodes
increases. To counteract this development we propose sparse binary compression
(SBC), a compression framework that allows for a drastic reduction of
communication cost for distributed training. SBC combines existing techniques
of communication delay and gradient sparsification with a novel binarization
method and optimal weight update encoding to push compression gains to new
limits. By doing so, our method also allows us to smoothly trade-off gradient
sparsity and temporal sparsity to adapt to the requirements of the learning
task. Our experiments show, that SBC can reduce the upstream communication on a
variety of convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures by more
than four orders of magnitude without significantly harming the convergence
speed in terms of forward-backward passes. For instance, we can train ResNet50
on ImageNet in the same number of iterations to the baseline accuracy, using
$\times 3531$ less bits or train it to a $1\%$ lower accuracy using $\times
37208$ less bits. In the latter case, the total upstream communication required
is cut from 125 terabytes to 3.35 gigabytes for every participating client.

the Compton scattering is strongly suppressed at that time, but they can be
significant if there is a considerable amount of compensated isocurvature
perturbation (CIP), which is not tightly constrained from the present CMB
observations. The linear $y$-distortions explicitly depend on the baryon
density fluctuations, therefore $y$ anisotropies can completely resolve the
degeneracy between the baryon isocurvature perturbations and the cold dark
matter ones. This novel method is free from lensing contaminations that can
affect the previous approach to the CIPs based on the nonlinear modulation of
the CMB anisotropies. We compute the cross correlation functions of the
$y$-distortions with the CMB temperature and the $E$ mode polarization
anisotropies. They are sensitive to the correlated CIPs parameterized by
$f'\equiv\mathcal P_{\rm CIP\zeta}/\mathcal P_{\zeta \zeta}$ with $\mathcal
P_{\zeta \zeta}$ and $\mathcal P_{\rm CIP\zeta}$ being the auto correlation of
the adiabatic perturbations and the cross correlation between them and the

has long involved the comparison of their integrated light, either in the form
of photometry or spectroscopic indexes, with empirical or synthetic templates.
Here we reevaluate the properties of old stellar populations using a new set of
stellar population synthesis models, designed to incorporate the effects of
binary stellar evolution pathways as a function of stellar mass and age. We
find that single-aged stellar population models incorporating binary stars, as
well as new stellar evolution and atmosphere models, can reproduce the colours
and spectral indices observed in both globular clusters and quiescent galaxies.
The best fitting model populations are often younger than those derived from
older spectral synthesis models, and may also lie at slightly higher
metallicities.

describing small-$x$ HERA data, and the inclusion of small-$x$ resummation in
parton distribution function (PDF) determination has a sizeable effect on the
PDFs even at the electroweak scale. In this work we explore the implications of
small-$x$ resummation at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and at a Future
Circular Collider (FCC). We construct the theoretical machinery for resumming
physical inclusive observables at hadron colliders, and describe its
implementation in the public code HELL 3.0. We focus on Higgs production in
gluon fusion as a prototypical example, both because it is sensitive to
small-$x$ gluons and because of its importance for the LHC physics programme.
We find that adding small-$x$ resummation to the N$^3$LO Higgs production cross
section can lead to an increase of up to 10% at FCC, while the effect is
smaller (+1%) at LHC but still important to achieve a high level of precision.

In most cases, the system structure at collapse time is, as expected, very
similar to what is obtained with simple one-dimensional dynamics, except in the
quasi-triaxial regime, where the phase-space sheet presents a velocity spike.
In all cases, the perturbative series exhibits a generic convergence behavior
as fast as an exponential of a power-law of the order of the expansion,

stringent constraints on the interaction cross-sections for scattering with

such particles can be captured by - and thermalized within - the Earth, leading
to a substantial accumulation and concentration of DM that interact with
baryons. Here, we discuss the probability that DM intercepted by the Earth will
be captured, the number of DM particles thereby accumulated over Earth's
lifetime, the fraction of such particles retained in the face of evaporation,
and the density distribution of such particles within the Earth. In the latter
context, we note that a previous treatment of the density distribution of DM,
presented by Gould and Raffelt and applied subsequently to DM in the Sun, is
inconsistent with considerations of hydrostatic equilibrium. Our analysis
provides an estimate of the DM particle density at Earth's surface, which may
exceed 1.E+14 cm-3 for the mass range under consideration. Based upon our
determination of the DM density at Earth's surface, we derive constraints on
the scattering cross-sections. These constraints are placed by four
considerations: (1) the lifetime of the relativistic proton beam at the Large

to search for the most massive neutron stars. Their main-sequence companion
stars are often strongly irradiated by the pulsar, displacing the effective
center of light from their barycenter and making mass measurements uncertain.
We present a series of optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of
PSR J2215+5135, a ""redback"" binary MSP in a 4.14 hr orbit, and measure a
drastic temperature contrast between the dark/cold
(T$_\mathrm{N}$=5660$^{+260}_{-380}$ K) and bright/hot
(T$_\mathrm{D}$=8080$^{+470}_{-280}$ K) sides of the companion star. We find
that the radial velocities depend systematically on the atmospheric absorption
lines used to measure them. Namely, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity
curve of J2215 measured with magnesium triplet lines is systematically higher
than that measured with hydrogen Balmer lines, by 10%. We interpret this as a
consequence of strong irradiation, whereby metallic lines dominate the dark
side of the companion (which moves faster) and Balmer lines trace its bright
(slower) side. Further, using a physical model of an irradiated star to fit
simultaneously the two-species radial velocity curves and the three-band light
curves, we find a center-of-mass velocity of K$_2$=412.3$\pm$5.0 km s$^{-1}$
and an orbital inclination i=63.9$^\circ$$^{+2.4}_{-2.7}$. Our model is able to
reproduce the observed fluxes and velocities without invoking irradiation by an

technical issues. (A) We show that one can map the dynamics of (1) a massless
scalar field in a universe with power law expansion to (2) a massive scalar
field in the de Sitter spacetime, which allows us to understand several
features of either system and clarifies several issues related to the massless
limit. (B) We obtain a useful integral representation for the Euclidean Green's
function for the de Sitter spacetime, by relating it to the solution of a
hypothetical electrostatic problem in five dimensions. This is helpful in the
study of several relevant limits. (C) We recover that in any Friedmann
universe, sourced by a negative pressure fluid, the Wightman function for a
massless scalar field is divergent. This shows that the divergence of Wightman
function for the massless field in the de Sitter spacetime is just a special,
limiting, case of this general phenomenon. (D) We provide a generally covariant
procedure for defining the power spectrum of vacuum fluctuations in terms of
the different Killing vectors present in the spacetime. This allows one to
study the interplay of the choice of vacuum state and the nature of the power
spectrum in different coordinate systems, in the de Sitter universe, in a

angle, the band structure changes dramatically. Numerical calculations have
shown that, at certain discrete angles called magic angles, the low energy
bands become flat leading to localization of electrons. The origin of this
strange behavior, however, is not well understood. Here, I propose a theory
that offers an understanding of the phenomenon, focusing on the first magic
angle. It is shown that coupling between the layers, in addition to
renormalizing the Dirac velocity, introduces higher order momentum terms in the
energy dispersion that are not all of the same sign. Partial cancellation among
these terms leads to the flatness of the low energy bands. Also, while there is
modulation of electron density in real space, there is no localization---the
modulation arises due to the superposition of plane wave states with different
momenta in the two layers. In addition, it is conjectured that there is an
underlying geometric reason for the appearance of more than one magic angle
which can be exploited to predict higher magic angles approximately without
computing the band structure.

surface plays an important role in the emergence of active regions, the
formation of sunspots and the overall solar dynamo. Observations suggest that
toroidal flux concentrations often referred to as ""flux tubes"", rise from their
region of initiation likely in the solar tachocline towards the solar surface
due to magnetic buoyancy. Many studies have assumed the existence of such
magnetic structures and studied the buoyant rise of an isolated flux tube in a
quiescent, field-free environment. Here, motivated by their formation (Cline et
al. 2003; Brummell et al. 2002), we relax the latter assumption and study the
rise of a toroidal flux tube embedded in a large-scale poloidal background
magnetic field. We find that the presence of the large-scale background field
severely affects the dynamics of the rising tube. A relatively weak background
field, as low as 6% of the tube strength, can destroy the rise of a tube that
would otherwise rise in the absence of the background field. Surprisingly, the
rise of tubes with one sign of the twist is suppressed by a significantly
weaker background field than the other. This demonstrates a potential mechanism
for the selection of the preferred helicity of rising and emerging tubes for
the solar case that is commensurate with many features of the hemispherical
rule.

validated Kepler planet, is in fact a brown-dwarf/low-mass star in a nearly
circular 7.2-day orbit around a subgiant star. Using a mass estimate for the
primary star derived from stellar models, we derive a companion mass and radius
of $0.075\pm0.003 \ M_{\odot}$ ($78.6\pm3.1 \ M_{Jup}$) and
$0.099^{+0.006}_{-0.004}\ R_{\odot}$ ($0.96^{+0.06}_{-0.04}\ R_{Jup}$),
respectively. Assuming the system is coeval, the evolutionary state of the
primary indicates the age is $\sim6.7$ Gyr. Kepler-503b sits right at the
hydrogen burning mass limit, straddling the boundary between brown dwarfs and
very low-mass stars. More precise radial velocities and secondary eclipse
spectroscopy with James Webb Space Telescope will provide improved measurements
of the physical parameters and age of this important system to better constrain
and understand the physics of these objects and their spectra. This system
emphasizes the value of radial velocity observations to distinguish a genuine
planet from astrophysical false positives, and is the first result from the
SDSS-IV monitoring of Kepler planet candidates with the multi-object APOGEE
instrument.

excellent source of on-demand single photons. Typically, applications require
simultaneous high efficiency of the source and quantum indistinguishability of
the extracted photons. While much progress has been made both in suppressing
background sources of decoherence and utilizing cavity-quantum electrodynamics
to overcome fundamental limitations set by the intrinsic exciton-phonon
scattering inherent in the solid-state platform, the role of the excitation
pulse has been often neglected. We investigate quantitatively the factors
associated with pulsed excitation that can limit simultaneous efficiency and
indistinguishability, including excitation of multiple excitons, multi-photons,
and pump-induced dephasing, and find for realistic single photon sources that
these effects cause degradation of the source figures-of-merit comparable to
that of phonon scattering. We also develop rigorous open quantum system polaron
master equation models of quantum dot dynamics under a time-dependent drive
which incorporate non-Markovian effects of both photon and phonon reservoirs,
and explicitly show how coupling to a high Q-factor cavity suppresses
multi-photon emission in a way not predicted by commonly employed models. We
then use our findings to summarize the criteria that can be used for single

paper, we further complement this toolbox by analytically showing that the
membrane curvature is also manifested in the absorption of SWs, leading to a
difference in the frequency linewidth (or lifetime) of counterpropagating
magnons. Herein, we studied the nanotubular case, predicting changes of
approximately greater than 10% and up to 20% in the frequency linewidth of
counterpropagating SWs for a wide range of nanotube radii ranging from 30 nm to
260 nm and with a thickness of 10 nm. These percentages are comparable to those
that can be extracted from experiments on heavy metal/magnetic metal
sandwiches, wherein linewidth asymmetry results from an interfacial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). We also show that the interplay
between the frequency linewidth and group velocity leads to asymmetries in the
SW decay length, presenting changes between 10\% and 22\% for
counterpropagating SWs in the frequency range of 2 - 10 GHz. For the case of
the SW dispersion relation, the predicted effects are identified as the
classical dipole-dipole interaction, and the analytical expression of the
frequency linewidth has the same mathematical form as in thin films with the
DMI. Furthermore, we present limiting cases of a tubular geometry with

and secure them with proof of work. In case of a fork of the chain, Bitcoin's
rule for achieving consensus is selecting the longest chain and discarding the
other chain as stale. It has been demonstrated that this consensus rule has a
weakness against selfish mining in which the selfish miner exploits the
variance in block generation by partially withholding blocks. In Ethereum,
however, under certain conditions stale blocks don't have to be discarded but
can be referenced from the main chain as uncle blocks yielding a partial
reward. This concept limits the impact of network delays on the expected
revenue for miners. But the concept also reduces the risk for a selfish miner
to gain no rewards from withholding a freshly minted block. This paper uses a
Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the effect of uncle blocks both to the
profitability of selfish mining and the blockchain's security in Ethereum

classifier is polylogarithmic in the dimension and number of data points. We

challenges facing machine learning nowa- days. However, in spite of hundreds of
papers on the topic being published every year, current theoretical
understanding and practical implementations of such tasks, in particular of
clustering, is very rudimentary. This note focuses on clustering. I claim that
the most signif- icant challenge for clustering is model selection. In contrast
with other common computational tasks, for clustering, dif- ferent algorithms
often yield drastically different outcomes. Therefore, the choice of a
clustering algorithm, and their pa- rameters (like the number of clusters) may
play a crucial role in the usefulness of an output clustering solution.
However, currently there exists no methodical guidance for clustering
tool-selection for a given clustering task. Practitioners pick the algorithms
they use without awareness to the implications of their choices and the vast
majority of theory of clustering papers focus on providing savings to the
resources needed to solve optimization problems that arise from picking some
concrete clustering objective. Saving that pale in com- parison to the costs of
mismatch between those objectives and the intended use of clustering results. I
argue the severity of this problem and describe some recent proposals aiming to
address this crucial lacuna.

for translating images from a source to a target domain because they can
produce high quality images and some even do not require paired data. However,
the basis of how these image translation models work is through matching the
translation output to the distribution of the target domain. This can cause an
issue when the data provided in the target domain has an over or under
representation of some classes (e.g. healthy or sick). When the output of an
algorithm is a transformed image there are uncertainties whether all known and
unknown class labels have been preserved or changed. Therefore, we recommend
that these translated images should not be used for direct interpretation (e.g.
by doctors) because they may lead to misdiagnosis of patients based on
hallucinated image features by an algorithm that matches a distribution.
However there are many recent papers that seem as though this is the goal.

with a sinusoidally varying radiation field and find that after a relaxation
time, determined by the propagation time for waves to move out of the
acceleration zone of the wind, the solution settles into a periodic state.
Winds driven at frequencies much higher than the dynamical frequency behave
like stationary winds with time averaged radiation flux whereas winds driven at
much lower frequencies oscillate between the high and low flux stationary
states. Most interestingly, we find a resonance frequency near the dynamical
frequency which results in velocity being enhanced or suppressed by a factor
comparable to the amplitude of the flux variation. Whether the velocity is
enhanced or suppressed depends on the relative phase between the radiation and
the dynamical variables. These results suggest that a time-varying radiation

Accurate modeling of outcome distributions associated with different

distributions using a novel Hilbert space representation called counterfactual
mean embedding (CME). The CME embeds the associated counterfactual distribution
into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) endowed with a positive definite

distributional treatment effect (DTE) that can quantify the causal effect over
entire outcome distributions. Our approach is nonparametric as the CME can be
estimated under the unconfoundedness assumption from observational data without
requiring any parametric assumption about the underlying distributions. We also
establish a rate of convergence of the proposed estimator which depends on the
smoothness of the conditional mean and the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the
underlying marginal distributions. Furthermore, our framework allows for more
complex outcomes such as images, sequences, and graphs. Our experimental
results on synthetic data and off-policy evaluation tasks demonstrate the

a future electron-ion collider or the peripheral scattering of protons

azimuthal angle of the produced ridges will be correlated with the scattering
plane of the electron or proton producing the virtual photon. In the case of
$ep \to eX$, the final state $X$ is expected to exhibit maximal multiplicity
when the elliptic flow in $X$ is aligned with the electron scattering plane. In

the fluid in the interior and the exterior of the cells. A DLD device optimized
for efficient cell sorting enables rapid medical diagnoses of several diseases
such as malaria since infected cells are stiffer than their healthy
counterparts. The device consists of pillar arrays in which pillar rows are
tilted and hence are not orthogonal to the columns. This arrangement leads
cells to have different final vertical displacements depending on their
deformability, therefore, it vertically separates the cells. Pillar cross
section, tilt angle of the pillar rows and center-to-center distances between
pillars define a unique device. For a given pair of viscosity contrast values
of the cells we seek optimal DLD designs by fixing the tilt angle and the
center-to-center distances. So the only design parameter is the pillar cross

objective function to try to capture efficient cell sorting. The objective
function is evaluated by simulating the cell flows through a device using our

using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), which is a

solving the optimization problem finds designs that can separate cells with
similar viscosity contrast values. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study which poses designing a DLD device as a constrained optimization

this satellite is so low it weakly disturbs the disk (type I migration). The
perturber may represent the companion of a binary system with a small mass
ratio. We compare the results of hydrodynamical simulations with analytic
predictions. Our two-dimensional (2D) simulations indicate that the torque
acting on a perturber with softening radius $R_{\rm soft}$ can be accounted for
by a scattering approach if $R_{\rm soft}<0.3H$, where $H$ is defined as the
ratio between the sound speed and the angular velocity at the orbital radius of
the perturber. For $R_{\rm soft}>0.3H$, the torque may present large and
persistent oscillations, but the resultant time-averaged torque decreases
rapidly with increasing $R_{\rm soft}/H$, in agreement with previous analytical
studies. We then focus on the torque acting on small-size perturbers embedded
in full three-dimensional (3D) disks and argue that the density waves
propagating at distances $\lesssim H$ from the perturber contribute
significantly to the torque because they transport angular momentum. We find a
good agreement between the torque found in 3D simulations and analytical
estimates based on ballistic orbits. We compare the radial migration timescales
of prograde versus retrograde perturbers. For a certain range of the
perturber's mass and aspect ratio of the disk, the radial migration timescale
in the retrograde case may be appreciably shorter than in the prograde case. We
also provide the smoothing length required in 2D simulations in order to

scale are modified by diffusiophoresis. We observe that the evolution of global
concentrations, defined as the inverse of the patches areas, are very similar
to those obtained experimentally in chaotic advection. They are quantitatively
explained by examining the area dilatation factor, in which diffusive and
diffusiophoretic effects are shown to be additive and appear as the divergence
of a diffusive contribution or of a drift velocity. An analysis based on
compressibility is developed in the salt-attracting case, for which colloids

a post-transform cache is traditionally suggested to enable reuse of vertex

popular class of machine learning models for analyzing sequential data. Their
training on modern GPUs, however, is limited by the GPU memory capacity. Our
profiling results of the LSTM RNN-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model
reveal that feature maps of the attention and RNN layers form the memory
bottleneck and runtime is unevenly distributed across different layers when
training on GPUs. Based on these two observations, we propose to recompute the
feature maps rather than stashing them persistently in the GPU memory.
  While the idea of feature map recomputation has been considered before,
existing solutions fail to deliver satisfactory footprint reduction, as they do
not address two key challenges. For each feature map recomputation to be
effective and efficient, its effect on (1) the total memory footprint, and (2)
the total execution time has to be carefully estimated. To this end, we propose
*Echo*, a new compiler-based optimization scheme that addresses the first
challenge with a practical mechanism that estimates the memory benefits of
recomputation over the entire computation graph, and the second challenge by
non-conservatively estimating the recomputation overhead leveraging layer
specifics. *Echo* reduces the GPU memory footprint automatically and
transparently without any changes required to the training source code, and is
effective for models beyond LSTM RNNs.
  We evaluate *Echo* on numerous state-of-the-art machine learning workloads on
real systems with modern GPUs and observe footprint reduction ratios of 1.89X
on average and 3.13X maximum. Such reduction can be converted into faster
training with a larger batch size, savings in GPU energy consumption (e.g.,
training with one GPU as fast as with four), and/or an increase in the maximum
number of layers under the same GPU memory budget.

  Stochastic Block Model",,,"10.1109/JSTSP.2018.2834874",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The community detection problem involves making inferences about node labels
in a graph, based on observing the graph edges. This paper studies the effect
of additional, non-graphical side information on the phase transition of exact
recovery in the binary stochastic block model (SBM) with $n$ nodes. When side
information consists of noisy labels with error probability $\alpha$, it is
shown that phase transition is improved if and only if
$\log(\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha})=\Omega(\log(n))$. When side information consists
of revealing a fraction $1-\epsilon$ of the labels, it is shown that phase
transition is improved if and only if $\log(1/\epsilon)=\Omega(\log(n))$. For a
more general side information consisting of $K$ features, two scenarios are
studied: (1)~$K$ is fixed while the likelihood of each feature with respect to
corresponding node label evolves with $n$, and (2)~The number of features $K$
varies with $n$ but the likelihood of each feature is fixed. In each case, we
find when side information improves the exact recovery phase transition and by
how much. The calculated necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery
are tight except for one special case. In the process of deriving inner bounds,
a variation of an efficient algorithm is proposed for community detection with
side information that uses a partial recovery algorithm combined with a local
improvement procedure.

challenge for Chinese intent classification stems from the fact that, unlike
English where most words are made up of 26 phonologic alphabet letters, Chinese
is logographic, where a Chinese character is a more basic semantic unit that
can be informative and its meaning does not vary too much in contexts. Chinese
word embeddings alone can be inadequate for representing words, and pre-trained

found to be in good agreement with existing theoretical and experimental
results. Better agreement with experiments can be reached by introducing a
reasonable bandwidth renormalization, evidencing the strong correlation among

straightforwardly obtained after finishing a first-principles calculation using

filaments that are crucial to processes as diverse as locomotion, mucus
clearance, embryogenesis and cell motility. Elastic driven rod-like filaments
subjected to compressive follower forces provide a way to mimic oscillatory
beating in synthetic settings. In the continuum limit, this spatiotemporal
response is an emergent phenomenon resulting from the interplay between the
structural elastic instability of the slender rods subjected to the
non-conservative follower forces, geometric constraints that control the onset
of this instability, and viscous dissipation due to fluid drag by ambient
media. In this paper, we use an elastic rod model to characterize beating
frequencies, the critical follower forces and the non-linear rod shapes, for
prestressed, clamped rods subject to two types of fluid drag forces, namely,
linear Stokes drag and non-linear Morrison drag. We find that the critical
follower force depends strongly on the initial slack and weakly on the nature
of the drag force. The emergent frequencies however, depend strongly on both
the extent of pre-stress as well as the nature of the fluid drag.

for a self-sustained relay to transmit its own covert information to a

provides energy to the relay for forwarding its information, the source does
not allow the relay's covert transmission and is to detect it. Considering the
time switching (TS) and power splitting (PS) schemes for energy harvesting,
where all the harvested energy is used for transmission at the self-sustained
relay, we derive the minimum detection error probability $\xi^{\ast}$ at the
source, based on which we determine the maximum effective covert rate
$\Psi^{\ast}$ subject to a given covertness constraint on $\xi^{\ast}$. Our
analysis shows that $\xi^{\ast}$ is the same for the TS and PS schemes, which
leads to the fact that the cost of achieving $\Psi^{\ast}$ in both the two
schemes in terms of the required increase in the energy conversion efficiency
at the relay is the same, although the values of $\Psi^{\ast}$ in these two
schemes can be different in specific scenarios. For example, the TS scheme
outperforms the PS scheme in terms of achieving a higher $\Psi^{\ast}$ when the
transmit power at the source is relatively low. If the covertness constraint is
tighter than a specific value, it is the covertness constraint that limits
$\Psi^{\ast}$, and otherwise it is upper bound on the energy conversion
efficiency that limits $\Psi^{\ast}$.

However in some instances, only short sequences may be available. This gives
rise to the question of how many samples are needed to compute entropy. In this

explain how intelligent behavior arises in the brain. The principle advantages
of neuromorphic emulators are that they are highly energy efficient, parallel

  Deep Model Inference",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Channel pruning is an important family of methods to speed up deep model's
inference. Previous filter pruning algorithms regard channel pruning and model
fine-tuning as two independent steps. This paper argues that combining them
into a single end-to-end trainable system will lead to better results. We
propose an efficient channel selection layer, namely AutoPruner, to find less
important filters automatically in a joint training manner. Our AutoPruner
takes previous activation responses as an input and generates a true binary
index code for pruning. Hence, all the filters corresponding to zero index
values can be removed safely after training. We empirically demonstrate that
the gradient information of this channel selection layer is also helpful for
the whole model training. By gradually erasing several weak filters, we can
prevent an excessive drop in model accuracy. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art pruning algorithms (including training from scratch),
AutoPruner achieves significantly better performance. Furthermore, ablation
experiments show that the proposed novel mini-batch pooling and binarization
operations are vital for the success of filter pruning.

architectures namely: branch-out CNN, fully convolutional neural network (FCN),
conditional random field as recurrent neural network (CRFasRNN), and SegNet,
support semantic pixel-wise labeling and focus on capturing textural

With the improved CNN model and no requirement of further post-processing, we

effect of time variation of transmission rates on the co-evolution of epidemics
and its corresponding awareness over a two layered multiplex network. In this
model, the infection transmission rate of a given node in the epidemic layer
depends upon its awareness probability in the awareness layer. Similarly, the
infection information transmission rate of a node in the awareness layer
depends upon its infection probability in the epidemic layer. The spread of
disease resulting from physical contacts is described in terms of SIS
(Susceptible Infected Susceptible) process over the epidemic layer and the
spread of information about the disease outbreak is described in terms of UAU
(Unaware Aware Unaware) process over the virtual interaction mediated awareness
layer. The time variation of the transmission rates and the resulting
co-evolution of these mutually competing processes is studied in terms of a
network topology depend parameter({\alpha}). Using a second order linear theory
it has been shown that in the continuous time limit, the co-evolution of these
processes can be described in terms of damped and driven harmonic oscillator
equations. From the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation, it is shown that for
the suitable choice of parameter({\alpha}), the two process can either exhibit
sustained oscillatory or damped dynamics. The damped dynamics corresponds to
the endemic state. Further, for the case of endemic state it is shown that the
inclusion of awareness layer significantly lowers the disease transmission rate
and reduces the size of epidemic. The endemic state infection probability of a
given node corresponding to the damped dynamics is found to have dependence
upon both the transmission rates as well as on both absolute intra-layer and
relative inter-layer degree of the individual nodes.

fine-grained alignments. Stack Overflow (SO) is a promising source to create
such a data set: the questions are diverse and most of them have corresponding
answers with high-quality code snippets. However, existing heuristic methods
(e.g., pairing the title of a post with the code in the accepted answer) are
limited both in their coverage and the correctness of the NL-code pairs
obtained. In this paper, we propose a novel method to mine high-quality aligned
data from SO using two sets of features: hand-crafted features considering the
structure of the extracted snippets, and correspondence features obtained by
training a probabilistic model to capture the correlation between NL and code
using neural networks. These features are fed into a classifier that determines
the quality of mined NL-code pairs. Experiments using Python and Java as test
beds show that the proposed method greatly expands coverage and accuracy over
existing mining methods, even when using only a small number of labeled
examples. Further, we find that reasonable results are achieved even when
training the classifier on one language and testing on another, showing promise
for scaling NL-code mining to a wide variety of programming languages beyond

obstacle in the sample and directly imaging the vortices after time of flight,
the critical velocity $v_{{\rm c}}$ for vortex shedding is measured as a
function of the obstacle travel distance $L$. The observed $v_{\rm c}$
increases with decreasing $L$, where the rate of increase is the highest in the
unitary regime. In the deep BEC regime, an empirical dissipation model well
captures the dependence of $v_{{\rm c}}$ on $L$, characterized by a constant
value of $\eta = -\frac{{\rm d}(1/v_{{\rm c}})}{{\rm d}(1/L)}$. However, as the
system is tuned across the resonance, a step increase of $\eta$ develops about
a characteristic distance $L_{\rm c}$ as $L$ is increased, where $L_{\rm c}$ is
comparable to the obstacle size. This bimodal behavior is strengthened as the
system is tuned towards the BCS regime. We attribute this evolution of $v_{{\rm

fermionic superfluid.

setting. In this work, we develop two algorithms intended for such setting:
Hypergraph Spectral Clustering (HSC) and Hypergraph Spectral Clustering with
Local Refinement (HSCLR). Our main contribution lies in performance analysis of
the poly-time algorithms under a random hypergraph model, which we name the
weighted stochastic block model, in which objects and multi-way measures are
modeled as nodes and weights of hyperedges, respectively. Denoting by $n$ the
number of nodes, our analysis reveals the following: (1) HSC outputs a
partition which is better than a random guess if the sum of edge weights (to be
explained later) is $\Omega(n)$; (2) HSC outputs a partition which coincides
with the hidden partition except for a vanishing fraction of nodes if the sum
of edge weights is $\omega(n)$; and (3) HSCLR exactly recovers the hidden
partition if the sum of edge weights is on the order of $n \log n$. Our results
improve upon the state of the arts recently established under the model and
they firstly settle the order-wise optimal results for the binary edge weight
case. Moreover, we show that our results lead to efficient sketching algorithms

limitation in explaining the diagnostic decision. In real clinical practice,
clinical decisions could be made with reasonable explanation. So current deep
learning approaches in CADx are limited in real world deployment. In this
paper, we investigate interpretability in CADx with the proposed interpretable
CADx (ICADx) framework. The proposed framework is devised with a generative
adversarial network, which consists of interpretable diagnosis network and
synthetic lesion generative network to learn the relationship between
malignancy and a standardized description (BI-RADS). The lesion generative
network and the interpretable diagnosis network compete in an adversarial
learning so that the two networks are improved. The effectiveness of the
proposed method was validated on public mammogram database. Experimental
results showed that the proposed ICADx framework could provide the
interpretability of mass as well as mass classification. It was mainly
attributed to the fact that the proposed method was effectively trained to find
the relationship between malignancy and interpretations via the adversarial
learning. These results imply that the proposed ICADx framework could be a
promising approach to develop the CADx system.

mismatches between training and execution environments. These mistakes can be
dangerous and difficult to discover because the agent cannot predict them a
priori. We propose using oracle feedback to learn a predictive model of these
blind spots to reduce costly errors in real-world applications. We focus on
blind spots in reinforcement learning (RL) that occur due to incomplete state
representation: The agent does not have the appropriate features to represent
the true state of the world and thus cannot distinguish among numerous states.
We formalize the problem of discovering blind spots in RL as a noisy supervised
learning problem with class imbalance. We learn models to predict blind spots
in unseen regions of the state space by combining techniques for label
aggregation, calibration, and supervised learning. The models take into
consideration noise emerging from different forms of oracle feedback, including
demonstrations and corrections. We evaluate our approach on two domains and
show that it achieves higher predictive performance than baseline methods, and
that the learned model can be used to selectively query an oracle at execution
time to prevent errors. We also empirically analyze the biases of various
feedback types and how they influence the discovery of blind spots.

explanatory sentence containing clues behind a network's decision. A Bayesian
inference algorithm is proposed to automatically associate filters and network

semantic network interpretation enables a better understanding of the

firstly, we design a Pairwise Ranking Convolutional Neural Network (PRCNN) to
extract depth rankings of human joints from images. Secondly, a coarse-to-fine
3D Pose Network(DPNet) is proposed to estimate 3D poses from both depth
rankings and 2D human joint locations. Additionally, to improve the generality

we find that this relationship is very sensitive to the way in which networks
are trained on ImageNet; many common forms of regularization slightly improve
ImageNet accuracy but yield penultimate layer features that are much worse for
transfer learning. Additionally, we find that, on two small fine-grained image
classification datasets, pretraining on ImageNet provides minimal benefits,
indicating the learned features from ImageNet do not transfer well to

2008 January to 2009 December,near the minimum of solar activity between cycles
23 and 24.With the new data sample the period of solar cycle 24 from near
minimum to maximum is investigated. A new method is used to improve the energy
reconstruction, allowing us to cover a much wider energy range, from 4 to 520
TeV. Below 100 TeV, the anisotropy is dominated by two wide regions, the
so-called ""tail-in"" and ""loss-cone"" features. At higher energies, a dramatic
change of the morphology is confirmed. The yearly time dependence of the
anisotropy is investigated. Finally, no noticeable variation of cosmic-ray
anisotropy with solar activity is observed for a median energy of 7 TeV.

the strongly complementary benefits of thermal information to visible data.
However, RGB-T research is limited by lacking a comprehensive evaluation
platform. In this paper, we propose a large-scale video benchmark dataset for
RGB-T tracking.It has three major advantages over existing ones: 1) Its size is
sufficiently large for large-scale performance evaluation (total frame number:
234K, maximum frame per sequence: 8K). 2) The alignment between RGB-T sequence
pairs is highly accurate, which does not need pre- or post-processing. 3) The
occlusion levels are annotated for occlusion-sensitive performance analysis of
different tracking algorithms.Moreover, we propose a novel graph-based approach
to learn a robust object representation for RGB-T tracking. In particular, the
tracked object is represented with a graph with image patches as nodes. This
graph including graph structure, node weights and edge weights is dynamically
learned in a unified ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers)-based
optimization framework, in which the modality weights are also incorporated for
adaptive fusion of multiple source data.Extensive experiments on the
large-scale dataset are executed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed tracker against other state-of-the-art tracking methods. We also
provide new insights and potential research directions to the field of RGB-T
object tracking.

computational efficiency of the algorithm is based on a recursive scheme which
makes the error analysis quite involved. In this article, we propose a new
algorithmic framework for the multiplication of hierarchical matrices. It
improves currently known implementations by reducing the multiplication of
hierarchical matrices towards finding a suitable low-rank approximation of sums

assumptions on the low-rank approximation method, the cost of the framework is
almost linear with respect to the size of the matrix. Numerical experiments

including cell division and motility, morphogenesis and transport. How local
remodeling of actin architecture tunes stress production and dissipation and
regulates large-scale network flow remains poorly understood. Here, we generate
contractile actomyosin networks with rapid turnover in vitro, by encapsulating
cytoplasmic Xenopus egg extracts into cell-sized 'water-in-oil' droplets.
Within minutes, the networks reach a dynamic steady-state with continuous
inward flow. The networks exhibit homogenous, density-independent contraction
for a wide range of physiological conditions, indicating that the
myosin-generated stress driving contraction is proportional to the effective
network viscosity. We further find that the contraction rate approximately
scales with the network turnover rate, but this relation breaks down in the
presence of excessive crosslinking or branching. Our findings suggest that

goal) are on the rise in Software Engineering (SE). Selecting unsuitable
aggregation techniques to analyze families may undermine their potential to
provide in-depth insights from experiments' results.
  Objectives: Identifying the techniques used to aggregate experiments' results
within families in SE. Raising awareness of the importance of applying suitable
aggregation techniques to reach reliable conclusions within families.
  Method: We conduct a systematic mapping study (SMS) to identify the
aggregation techniques used to analyze families of experiments in SE. We
outline the advantages and disadvantages of each aggregation technique
according to mature experimental disciplines such as medicine and pharmacology.
We provide preliminary recommendations to analyze and report families of
experiments in view of families' common limitations with regard to joint data
analysis.
  Results: Several aggregation techniques have been used to analyze SE families
of experiments, including Narrative synthesis, Aggregated Data (AD), Individual
Participant Data (IPD) mega-trial or stratified, and Aggregation of p-values.
The rationale used to select aggregation techniques is rarely discussed within
families. Families of experiments are commonly analyzed with unsuitable
aggregation techniques according to the literature of mature experimental
disciplines.
  Conclusion: Data analysis' reporting practices should be improved to increase
the reliability and transparency of joint results. AD and IPD stratified appear
to be suitable to analyze SE families of experiments.

present and review a theory independent approach in holography to study such
phenomena. We firstly argue that the heavy quark diffusion occurs in realistic
strongly coupled systems. Then we analyze the quantum and thermal fluctuation,
dissipation and the corresponding Brownian motion of a heavy particle in such
environments for a wide class of theories. The holographic study is based on
the properties of the straight string fluctuations. The observables and
coefficients associated with the stochastic motion depend on a single parameter
which encodes the properties of the different theories. Moreover, certain
Dp-brane fluctuations can be mapped one-to-one to the string fluctuations and
therefore the stochastic brane observables can be read from the string ones.
  Then we review the Langevin diffusion of a moving heavy quark in generic
thermal holographic theories. The analysis is based on the properties of the
trailing string and its fluctuations. The string world-sheet has a black hole
horizon and the quark feels an effective temperature different than the
environmental one. The formulas of the effective temperature, the drag force on
the particle and the Langevin coefficients are given in terms of the background
metric elements readily applicable to any theory. At the end we comment on the
backreaction effects on the medium and present results of the Monte Carlo

In this paper, we propose that the emerging technology of quantum key
distribution (QKD) can be applied to enhance the privacy and security of NCS up
to an unbreakable level. QKD can continuously distribute random secret keys
with much higher privacy between communication parties, and thus enable the
one-time pad encryption that cannot be truly applied in classical networks. We
show that the resulting overall security of NCS can be essentially improved,
and present a composable definition of security based on the analysis of the
key generation and management processes. Moreover, because the security is
mainly determined by quantum keys rather than the complexity of encryption
algorithms, the control performance can be improved as well by reducing the
time delay using simpler algorithms. These advantages are demonstrated by the
example of a remotely controlled servo system, showing that the introduction of
QKD to NCS can simultaneously improve the security and performance by using the
simplest encryption algorithm XOR. Furthermore, we propose a novel
Kalman-filter embedded communication protocol that can more efficiently use the
raw keys generated by QKD.

inversion methods to derive the internal rotational profile of the star. The
detection of new splittings of mixed modes, more concentrated in the very inner
part of the helium core, allowed us to reconstruct the angular velocity profile
deeper into the interior of the star and to disentangle the details better than
in Paper I: the helium core rotates almost rigidly about 6 times faster than
the convective envelope, while part of the hydrogen shell seems to rotate at a
constant velocity about 1.15 times lower than the He core. In particular, we
studied the internal shear layer between the fast-rotating radiative interior
and the slow convective zone and we found that it lies partially inside the
hydrogen shell above $r \simeq 0.05R$ and extends across the core-envelope
boundary. Finally, we theoretically explored the possibility for the future to
sound the convective envelope in the red-giant stars and we concluded that the
inversion of a set of splittings with only low-harmonic degree $l\leq 3$, even

late-time activity of the central engine and can be used to constrain the
overall energy budget. In this paper, we collect a sample of $19$ long GRBs
observed by \emph{Swift}-XRT that contain giant flares in their X-ray
afterglows. We fit this sample with a version of the magnetar propeller model,
modified to include fallback accretion. This model has already successfully
reproduced extended emission in short GRBs. Our best fits provide a reasonable
morphological match to the light curves. However, $16$ out of $19$ of the fits
require efficiencies for the propeller mechanism that approach $100\%$. The
high efficiency parameters are a direct result of the high energy contained in
the flares and the extreme duration of the dipole component, which forces
either slow spin periods or low magnetic fields. We find that even with the
inclusion of significant fallback accretion, in all but a few cases it is
energetically challenging to produce prompt emission, afterglow and giant
flares within the constraints of the rotational energy budget of a magnetar.

beam energy region of the highest net-baryon densities on the basis of
non-equilibrium microscopic transport model JAM and macroscopic 3+1D
hydrodynamics by utilizing a dynamical initialization method. In this
model,dynamical fluidization of a system is controlled by the source terms of
the hydrodynamic fields. In addition, time dependent core-corona separation of
hot regions is implemented. We show that our new model describes multiplicities
and mean transverse mass in heavy-ion collisions within a beam energy region of
$3<\sqrt{s_{NN}}<30$ GeV. Good agreement of the beam energy dependence of the
$K^+/\pi^+$ ratio is obtained, which is explained by the fact that a part of
the system is not thermalized in our core-corona approach.

words (factors) of a given string. For two strings, we introduce the joint
string complexity as the cardinality of a set of words that are common to both
strings. String complexity finds a number of applications from capturing the
richness of a language to finding similarities between two genome sequences. In
this paper we analyze the joint string complexity when both strings are
generated by Markov sources. We prove that the joint string complexity grows
linearly (in terms of the string lengths) when both sources are statistically
indistinguishable and sublinearly when sources are statistically not the same.
Precise analysis of the joint string complexity turns out to be quite
challenging requiring subtle singularity analysis and saddle point method over
infinity many saddle points leading to novel oscillatory phenomena with single
and double periodicities. To overcome these challenges, we apply powerful
analytic techniques such as multivariate generating functions, multivariate
depoissonization and Mellin transform, spectral matrix analysis, and complex
asymptotic methods.

modelling several problems in computer vision such as stereo correspondence and
multi-class semantic segmentation. By modelling long-range interactions, dense
CRFs provide a labelling that captures finer detail than their sparse
counterparts. Currently, the state-of-the-art algorithm performs mean-field
inference using a filter-based method but fails to provide a strong theoretical
guarantee on the quality of the solution. A question naturally arises as to
whether it is possible to obtain a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of a
dense CRF using a principled method. Within this paper, we show that this is
indeed possible. We will show that, by using a filter-based method, continuous
relaxations of the MAP problem can be optimised efficiently using
state-of-the-art algorithms. Specifically, we will solve a quadratic
programming (QP) relaxation using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and a linear
programming (LP) relaxation by developing a proximal minimisation framework. By
exploiting labelling consistency in the higher-order potentials and utilising
the filter-based method, we are able to formulate the above algorithms such
that each iteration has a complexity linear in the number of classes and random
variables. The presented algorithms can be applied to any labelling problem
using a dense CRF with sparse higher-order potentials. In this paper, we use
semantic segmentation as an example application as it demonstrates the ability
of the algorithm to scale to dense CRFs with large dimensions. We perform
experiments on the Pascal dataset to indicate that the presented algorithms are
able to attain lower energies than the mean-field inference method.

ultraviolet (UV) wavebands. We use the arsenal of UV and optical data for
galaxies in the Coma supercluster covering ~ 500 square degrees on the sky to
study their photometric and spectroscopic properties as a function of
environment at various scales. We identify the different components of the
cosmic-web: large-scale filaments and voids using Discrete Persistent
Structures Extractor, and groups and clusters using Hierarchical Density-based
spatial clustering of applications with noise, respectively. We find that in
the Coma supercluster the median emission in Halpha inclines, while the g-r and
FUV-NUV colours of galaxies become bluer moving further away from the spine of
the filaments out to a radius of around 1 Mpc. On the other hand, an opposite
trend is observed as the distance between the galaxy and centre of the nearest
cluster or group decreases. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that
properties of galaxies are not just defined by its stellar mass and large-scale
density, but also by the environmental processes resulting due to the
intrafilament medium whose role in accelerating galaxy transformations needs to
be investigated thoroughly using multi-wavelength data.

  (EWRL), 2018",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficient exploration is one of the key challenges for reinforcement learning
(RL) algorithms. Most traditional sample efficiency bounds require strategic
exploration. Recently many deep RL algorithms with simple heuristic exploration
strategies that have few formal guarantees, achieve surprising success in many
domains. These results pose an important question about understanding these
exploration strategies such as $e$-greedy, as well as understanding what
characterize the difficulty of exploration in MDPs. In this work we propose
problem specific sample complexity bounds of $Q$ learning with random walk
exploration that rely on several structural properties. We also link our
theoretical results to some empirical benchmark domains, to illustrate if our
bound gives polynomial sample complexity in these domains and how that is
related with the empirical performance.

  measurements at a fixed frequency",,,"10.1088/1361-6420/aad81f",,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is concerned with the inverse obstacle scattering problem with
phaseless far-field data at a fixed frequency. The main difficulty of this
problem is the so-called translation invariance property of the modulus of the
far-field pattern or the phaseless far-field pattern generated by one plane
wave as the incident field, which means that the location of the obstacle can
not be recovered from such phaseless far-field data at a fixed frequency. It
was recently proved in our previous work \cite{XZZ18} that the obstacle can be
uniquely determined by the phaseless far-field patterns generated by infinitely
many sets of superpositions of two plane waves with different directions at a
fixed frequency if the obstacle is a priori known to be a sound-soft or an
impedance obstacle with real-valued impedance function. The purpose of this
paper is to develop a direct imaging algorithm to reconstruct the location and
shape of the obstacle from the phaseless far-field data corresponding to
infinitely many sets of superpositions of two plane waves with a fixed
frequency as the incident fields. Our imaging algorithm only involves the
calculation of the products of the measurement data with two exponential
functions at each sampling point and is thus fast and easy to implement.
Further, the proposed imaging algorithm does not need to know the type of
boundary conditions on the obstacle in advance and is capable to reconstruct
multiple obstacles with different boundary conditions. Numerical experiments
are also carried out to illustrate that our imaging method is stable, accurate
and robust to noise.

group laws over $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$-algebras. An oriented cohomology theory in
the sense of Levin-Morel is called $p^n$-typical if its corresponding formal
group law is $p^n$-typical. The main result of the paper is the construction of
'Chern classes' from the algebraic $n$-th Morava K-theory to every
$p^n$-typical oriented cohomology theory.
  If the coefficient ring of a $p^n$-typical theory is a free
$\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$-module we also prove that these Chern classes freely
generate all operations to it. Examples of such theories are algebraic $mn$-th
Morava K-theories $K(nm)^*$ for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and
$\mathrm{CH}^*\otimes\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ (operations to Chow groups were studied
in a previous paper). The universal $p^n$-typical oriented theory is
$BP\{n\}^*=BP^*/(v_j,j\nmid n)$ which coefficient ring is also a free
$\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$-module.
  Chern classes from the $n$-th algebraic Morava K-theory $K(n)^*$ to itself
allow us to introduce the gamma filtration on $K(n)^*$. This is the best
approximation to the topological filtration obtained by values of operations
and it satisfies properties similar to that of the classical gamma filtration
on $K_0$. The major difference from the classical case is that Chern classes
from the graded factors $gr^i_\gamma K(n)^*$ to
$\mathrm{CH}^i\otimes\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ are surjective for $i\le p^n$. For some
projective homogeneous varieties this allows to estimate $p$-torsion in Chow
groups of codimension up to $p^n$.

best possible multiplicative reduction in Alice's guessing-moments obtainable

through a binary symmetric channel, we provide two lower bounds on the guessing
efficiency by analyzing the performance of the Dictator and Majority functions,
and two upper bounds via maximum entropy and Fourier-analytic /
hypercontractivity arguments. We then extend our maximum entropy argument to
give a lower bound on the guessing efficiency for a general channel with a
binary uniform input, via the strong data-processing inequality constant of the
reverse channel. We compute this bound for the binary erasure channel, and
conjecture that Greedy Dictator functions achieve the guessing efficiency.

  We show that the second Morava $K$-theory detects the triviality of the Rost

invariants and the splitting of Morava motives.
  We describe the Morava $K$-theory of generalized Rost motives, compute the
Morava $K$-theory of some affine varieties, and characterize the powers of the
fundamental ideal of the Witt ring with the help of the Morava $K$-theory.
Besides, we obtain new estimates on torsion in Chow groups of codimensions up
to $2^n$ of quadrics from the $(n+2)$-nd power of the fundamental ideal of the
Witt ring. We compute torsion in Chow groups of $K(n)$-split varieties with
respect to a prime $p$ in all codimensions up to $\frac{p^n-1}{p-1}$ and
provide a combinatorial tool to estimate torsion up to codimension $p^n$. An
important role in the proof is played by the gamma filtration on Morava
$K$-theories, which gives a conceptual explanation of the nature of the
torsion.
  Furthermore, we show that under some conditions the $K(n)$-motive of a smooth
projective variety splits if and only if its $K(m)$-motive splits for all $m\le

an echelle spectrograph consisting of a classical off-axis paraboloid

of the equity holders of a participating life insurance contract. In a setting
with unhedgeable mortality risk and complete financial market, the optimal
solution is given explicitly for contracts with mortality risk using a
martingale approach for constrained non-concave optimization problems. We show
that regulatory VaR constraints for participating insurance contracts lead to
more prudent investment than in the case of no regulation. This result is
contrary to the situation where the insurer maximizes the utility of the total
wealth of the company (without distinguishing between contributions of equity
holders and policyholders), in which case a VaR constraint may induce the
insurer to take excessive risks leading to higher losses than in the case of no
regulation. Compared to the unregulated problem, the VaR-constrained strategy
leads to a higher expected utility for the policyholders, highlighting the
potential usefulness of a VaR-regulation in the context of insurance. The
prudent investment behavior is more significant if a VaR-type regulation is
replaced by a portfolio insurance (PI)-type regulation. Furthermore, a stricter
regulation (a smaller allowed default probability in the VaR problem or a
higher minimum guarantee level in the PI problem) enhances the benefit of the
policyholder but deteriorates that of the insurer. For both types of
regulation, the gains in terms of expected utility are greater for higher
participation rates, while being smaller for higher bonus rates. We also extend
our analysis to frameworks where dividend and premature death benefit payments
are made at an intermediate time date.

physical systems where thermal fluctuations are inevitable. In the studies of
stochastic thermodynamics, some thermodynamic quantities, such as the
trajectory work, associated with the complete Langevin equation (the Kramers
equation) are often assumed to converge to those associated with the overdamped
Langevin equation (the Smoluchowski equation) in the overdamped limit under the
overdamped approximation. Nevertheless, a rigorous mathematical proof of the
convergence of the work distributions to our knowledge has not been reported so
far. Here we study the convergence of the work distributions explicitly. In the
overdamped limit, we rigorously prove the convergence of the extended
Fokker-Planck equations including work using a multiple timescale expansion
approach. By taking the linearly dragged harmonic oscillator as an exactly
solvable example, we analytically calculate the work distribution associated
with the Kramers equation, and verify its convergence to that associated with
the Smoluchowski equation in the overdamped limit. We quantify the accuracy of
the overdamped approximation as a function of the damping coefficient. In
addition, we experimentally demonstrate that the data of the work distribution
of a levitated silica nanosphere agrees with the overdamped approximation in
the overdamped limit, but deviates from the overdamped approximation in the
low-damping case. Our work fills a gap between the stochastic thermodynamics
based on the complete Langevin equation (the Kramers equation) and the

of interacting agents via observations of the state-evolution of the agents. We
focus on the large-scale network setting with the additional constraint of
$partial$ observations, where only a small fraction of the agents can be
feasibly observed. The goal is to infer the underlying subnetwork of
interactions and we refer to this problem as $local$ $tomography$. In order to
study the large-scale setting, we adopt a proper stochastic formulation where
the unobserved part of the network is modeled as an Erd\""{o}s-R\'enyi random
graph, while the observable subnetwork is left arbitrary. The main result of
this work is establishing that, under this setting, local tomography is
actually possible with high probability, provided that certain conditions on
the network model are met (such as stability and symmetry of the network
combination matrix). Remarkably, such conclusion is established under the
$low$-$observability$ $regime$, where the cardinality of the observable
subnetwork is fixed, while the size of the overall network scales to infinity.

incorporate nonlinear relationships between arbitrary predictor variables and
forecast distribution parameters that are automatically learned in a
data-driven way rather than requiring pre-specified link functions. In a case
study of 2-meter temperature forecasts at surface stations in Germany, the
neural network approach significantly outperforms benchmark post-processing
methods while being computationally more affordable. Key components to this
improvement are the use of auxiliary predictor variables and station-specific

network can be used to gain insight into the importance of meteorological
variables thereby challenging the notion of neural networks as uninterpretable
black boxes. Our approach can easily be extended to other statistical

spectrum of ozone at 10\,$\mu$m, an even better reduction of the frequency
scale error by two orders of magnitude is obtained by using the pre-distortion

paper of the series, we present a new version of the Monte Carlo code STOKES
that accounts for dilution by interstellar polarization and host starlight in
radiative transfer modeling. We upgrade our code by including spectral energy
distribution (SED) templates for a set of representative host galaxies. The
unpolarized light emitted by those hosts alters the observer polarization while
being coherently radiatively coupled to the AGN structure. We also include in
our analysis tool a routine that may add, depending on the user's objectives,
an interstellar component. Using a generic AGN model, we illustrate how
interstellar polarization and starlight dilution impact the observed
polarimetric signal of AGN. We apply our code to NGC-1068, an archetypal
edge-on AGN and demonstrate that STOKES can reproduce its SED, the expected
wavelength-dependent polarimetric signatures, and the observed high-angular
resolution polarimetric maps. Using the flexibility of the code, we derive
several intrinsic parameters such as the system inclination and the torus
opening angle. The new version of our publicly available code now allows

CRLB and the asymptotic normalized covariance matrix for certain Gaussian
approximations of Wiener systems to show how a non-linear sensor affects the
accuracy compared to a corresponding linear sensor. The key idea is to take
second order statistics into account by using a common parametrization of the
mean and the variance of the output process. This analysis also leads to a ML

the core of $\alpha$ Centauri A is of the utmost importance if this star is to
be used in the calibration of stellar model physics. Adoption of different
parallax measurements available in the literature results in differences in the
interferometric radius constraints used in stellar modelling. Further, this is
at the origin of the different dynamical mass measurements reported for this
star. With the goal of reproducing the revised dynamical mass derived by
Pourbaix & Boffin, we modelled the star using two stellar grids varying in the
adopted nuclear reaction rates. Asteroseismic and spectroscopic observables
were complemented with different interferometric radius constraints during the
optimisation procedure. Our findings show that best-fit models reproducing the
revised dynamical mass favour the existence of a convective core ($\gtrsim$ 70%
of best-fit models), a result that is robust against changes to the model
physics. If this mass is accurate, then $\alpha$ Centauri A may be used to
calibrate stellar model parameters in the presence of a convective core.

the presence of cycles of transitions that take place in the model amorphous

blood pressure (SBP) dip from 24-hour blood pressure trends using a wrist-worn
photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and a deep neural network in free-living
individuals, comparing the deep neural network to traditional machine learning
and non-machine learning baselines.
  Approach: A wrist-worn PPG sensor was worn by 106 healthy individuals for 226
days during which 5111 reference values for blood pressure (BP) were obtained
with a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitor and matched with the PPG sensor data.
Features based on heart rate variability and pulse morphology were extracted
from the PPG waveforms. Long- and short term memory (LSTM) networks, dense
networks, random forests and linear regression models were trained and
evaluated in their capability of tracking trends in BP, as well as the
estimation of the SBP dip.
  Main results: Best performance for estimating the SBP dip were obtained with
a deep LSTM neural network with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of
3.12$\pm$2.20 $\Delta$mmHg and a correlation of 0.69 $(p=3*10^{-5})$. This dip
was derived from trend estimates of BP which had an RMSE of 8.22$\pm$1.49 mmHg
for systolic and 6.55$\pm$1.39 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). While other models
had similar performance for the tracking of relative BP, they did not perform
as well as the LSTM for the SBP dip.
  Significance: The work provides first evidence for the unobtrusive estimation
of the nocturnal SBP dip, a highly prognostic clinical parameter. It is also
the first to evaluate unobtrusive BP measurement in a large data set of
unconstrained 24-hour measurements in free-living individuals and provides
evidence for the utility of LSTM models in this domain.

geometric medians and Karcher/Fr\'{e}chet means of arbitrary distributions,
constructing centroidal Voronoi diagrams, and finding consistently ordered

three prefactored linear systems, each akin to a standard Poisson problem. To
implement the method we need only a discrete connection Laplacian, which we
describe for a variety of geometric data structures (point clouds, polygon

to compute a precise reference orbit for the three weeks of decay, and to
extrapolate the ballistic coefficient evolution of the object. In previous
works, the capabilities of radar-based solutions for the re-entry predictions
of GOCE and of similar objects were investigated, focusing on the german TIRA
radar. In this work we have performed additional analysis, focusing on the
northern european radar EISCAT-UHF, located in Troms\o, Norway. This sensor,
conceived for atmospheric studies, has recently been considered for space
debris applications. Due to its limited tracking capabilities, we are
interested in testing its effectiveness in supporting re-entry predictions. We
have simulated reliable re-entry prediction scenarios, with different
availability of data from EISCAT and TIRA. The main conclusion is that,
provided a suitable amount of observations, EISCAT-based re-entry predictions
are comparable to TIRA-based, but also to GPS and TLE-based, corresponding
ones. In general, EISCAT is not able to determine an orbit with the same
accuracy of TIRA, but the results are equivalent in terms of re-entry
predictions, if we consider the relevant parameters involved and their effects
on the re-entry time. What is very important is the difficulty in predicting
atmospheric and attitude significant variations in between the current epoch
and the actual re-entry. Thus, it is not easy to keep the accuracy of
predictions much lower than 10% of the residual lifetime, apart from cases with
constant area to mass ratio, and low atmospheric variations with respect to the
models. An experiment with real data is presented for the object 2012-006K,

that losses may be neglected. The first part of the work addresses interactions
between identical fundamental solitons, with phase shift $% \varphi $ between
them, separated by a finite distance in the free space. The outcome strongly
changes with the variation of $\varphi $: in-phase solitons with $\varphi =0$,
or with sufficiently small $\varphi $, merge into a single fundamental soliton,
with weak residual oscillations in it (in contrast to the merger into a
strongly oscillating breather, which is exhibited by the 1D version of the same
setting), while the choice of $% \varphi =\pi $ leads to fast separation
between mutually repelling solitons. At intermediate values of $\varphi $, such
as $\varphi =\pi /2$, the interaction is repulsive too, breaking the symmetry
between the initially identical fundamental solitons, there appearing two
solitons with different total energies (norms). The symmetry-breaking effect is
qualitatively explained, similar to how it was done previously for 1D solitons.

difficult to detect than significant SNPs, partly due to the massive amount of
SNP-SNP combinations. We propose to move away from testing interaction terms,
and move towards testing whether an individual SNP is involved in any
interaction. This reduces the multiple testing burden to one test per SNP, and
allows for interactions with unobserved factors. Analysing one SNP at a time,
we split the individuals into two groups, based on the number of minor alleles.
If the quantitative trait differs in mean between the two groups, the SNP has a
main effect. If the quantitative trait differs in distribution between some
individuals in one group and all other individuals, it possibly has an
interactive effect. We propose a mixture test to detect both types of effects.
Implicitly, the membership probabilities may suggest potential interacting

polarisation are expected to reach unprecedented power over the next decade. A
major difficulty in these ongoing searches is that galactic foregrounds such as
dust can easily mimic inflationary signals. Though typically foregrounds are
separated from primordial signals using the foregrounds' different frequency
dependence, in this paper we investigate instead the extent to which the
galactic dust B-modes' statistical anisotropy can be used to distinguish them
from inflationary B-modes, building on the work of Kamionkowski and Kovetz
(2014). In our work, we extend existing anisotropy estimators and apply them to
simulations of polarised dust to forecast their performance for future
experiments. Considering the application of this method as a null-test for dust
contamination to CMB-S4, we find that we can detect residual dust levels
corresponding to $r\sim0.001$ at $2\sigma$, which implies that statistical
anisotropy estimators will be a powerful diagnostic for foreground residuals
(though our results show some dependence on the dust simulation used). Finally,
considering applications beyond a simple null test, we demonstrate how
anisotropy statistics can be used to construct an estimate of the dust B-mode
map, which could potentially be used to clean the B-mode sky.

generation of an auxiliary random variable (RV) that converges in distribution
to the original CGQF. Since the mean squared error between both is given in a
simple closed-form formulation, the auxiliary RV can be particularized to
achieve the required accuracy. The technique is valid for both definite and
indefinite CGQFs and yields simple expressions of the probability density
function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) that involve only
elementary functions. This overcomes a major limitation of previous approaches,
in which the complexity of the resulting PDF and CDF prevents from using them
for subsequent calculations. To illustrate this end, the proposed method is
applied to maximal ratio combining systems over correlated Rician channels, for
which the outage probability and the average bit error rate are derived.

fundamental optimization algorithms and an important primitive in large-scale

applies to the setting of only two blocks -- is known to have convergence time
that scales independently of the least smooth block. A natural question is
then: is the setting of two blocks special?
  We show that the answer is ""no"" as long as the least smooth block can be
optimized exactly -- an assumption that is also needed in the setting of
alternating minimization. We do so by introducing a novel algorithm AR-BCD,
whose convergence time scales independently of the least smooth (possibly
non-smooth) block. The basic algorithm generalizes both alternating
minimization and randomized block coordinate (gradient) descent, and we also
provide its accelerated version -- AAR-BCD. As a special case of AAR-BCD, we
obtain the first nontrivial accelerated alternating minimization algorithm.

orbit migration among stars in the Milky Way disk. This model parameterizes the
possible star formation and enrichment histories, radial birth profiles, and
combines them with a migration model that relates present-day orbital radii to
birth radii through a Gaussian probability, broadening with age $\tau$ as
$\sigma_\mathrm{RM8}~\sqrt{\tau/8{~\mathrm{Gyr}}}$. Guided by observations, we
assume that stars are born with an initially tight age--metallicity relation at
given radius, which becomes subsequently scrambled by radial orbit migration,
thereby providing a direct observational constraint on radial orbit migration
strength $\sigma_\mathrm{RM8}$. We fit this model with MCMC to the observed
age--metallicity distribution of low-$\alpha$ red clump stars with
Galactocentric radii between 5 and 14 kpc from APOGEE DR12, sidestepping the
complex spatial selection function and accounting for the considerable age
uncertainties. This simple model reproduces well the observed data, and we find
a global (in radius and time) radial orbit migration efficiency in the Milky
Way of $\sigma_\mathrm{RM8}=3.6\pm 0.1$ kpc when marginalizing over all other
model aspects. This shows that radial orbit migration in the Milky Way's main
disk is indeed rather strong, in line with theoretical expectations: stars
migrate by about a half-mass radius over the age of the disk. The model finds
the Sun's birth radius at $\sim 5.2$ kpc. If such strong radial orbit migration
is typical, this mechanism plays indeed an important role in setting the
structural regularity of disk galaxies.

In practice, each subject may have multiple face images. Taking the eye size as

how to compute these attributes corresponding to each subject rather than each

training for facial attributes prediction, and we explore the inconsistency
issue among the attributes computed from each single image. Then, we develop
two approaches to address the inconsistency issue. Experimental results show
that the proposed methods can handle facial attribute estimation on either
multiple still images or video frames, and can correct the incorrectly
annotated labels. The experiments are conducted on two large public databases

  Zhao",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The works in this portfolio test the hypothesis that it is not possible to
extrapolate the Newtonian inverse square law of gravity from Solar System to
galaxy scales. In particular, I look into various tests of Modified Newtonian
Dynamics (MOND), which posits a modification below a very low acceleration
threshold. Although discrepancies with Newtonian dynamics are indeed observed,
they can usually be explained by invoking an appropriate distribution of
invisible mass known as dark matter (DM). This leads to the standard
cosmological paradigm, $\Lambda$CDM. I consider how it may be distinguished
from MOND using collision velocities of galaxy clusters, which should sometimes
be much faster in MOND. I focus on measuring these velocities more accurately
and conclude that this test ought to be feasible in the near future.
  For the time being, I look at the much nearer and more accurately observed
Local Group (LG) of galaxies. Its main constituents $-$ the Milky Way (MW) and
Andromeda (M31) $-$ should have undergone a past close flyby in MOND but not in
$\Lambda$CDM. The fast MW-M31 relative motion around the time of their flyby
would have allowed them to gravitationally slingshot any passing LG dwarf
galaxies out at high speed. I consider whether there is any evidence for such
high-velocity galaxies (HVGs). Several candidates are found in two different
$\Lambda$CDM models of the LG, one written by a founding figure of the
paradigm. The properties of these HVGs are similar to what might be expected in
MOND, especially their tendency to lie close to a plane. Being more confident
of its validity, I then used MOND to determine the escape velocity curve of the
MW over the distance range 8$-$50 kpc, finding reasonable agreement with the
latest observations. I finish by discussing possible future directions for MOND
research.

magneto optical Kerr effect (MOKE). However, longitudinal MOKE images were
dominated by an artifact arising from the edges of the Au NCs. Time resolved
imaging revealed the simultaneous excitation of a non-linear `bullet' mode at
the centre of the device, once the DC current exceeded a threshold value, and
ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) induced by the RF current. However, the FMR
response observed for sub-critical DC current values exhibits an amplitude
minimum at the centre, which is attributed to spreading of the RF spin current
due to the reactance of the device structure. This FMR response can be
subtracted to yield images of the bullet mode. As the DC current is increased
above threshold, the bullet mode appears to increase in size, suggesting
increased translational motion. The reduced spatial overlap of the bullet and
FMR modes, and this putative translational motion, may impede the injection
locking and contribute to the reduced locking range observed within NC-SHNO
devices. This illustrates a more general need to control the geometry of an
injection-locked oscillator so that the autonomous dynamics of the oscillator
exhibit strong spatial overlap with those resulting from the injected signal.

yields of all three states are found to be significantly suppressed, and
compatible with a sequential ordering of the suppression,
R$_\mathrm{AA}$($\Upsilon$(1S)) $>$ R$_\mathrm{AA}$($\Upsilon$(2S)) $>$
R$_\mathrm{AA}$($\Upsilon$(3S)) . The suppression of $\Upsilon$(1S) is larger
than that seen at $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}} =$ 2.76 TeV, although the two are
compatible within uncertainties. The upper limit on the R$_\mathrm{AA}$ of
$\Upsilon$(3S) integrated over $p_\mathrm{T}$ and rapidity is 0.094 at 95%

survey is presented. In the present study generalized additive mixed models
were used to estimate the spatio-temporal trends of defoliation of the main
tree species from 1989 to 2015 and to examine the suitability of different
monitoring grid resolutions. Although data has been collected since 1989, this
is the first time the spatio-temporal modelling for entire Germany has been
carried out. Besides the space-time component, stand age showed a significant
effect on defoliation. The mean age and the species-specific relation between
defoliation and age determined the general level of defoliation whereas
fluctuations of defoliation were primarily related to weather conditions. The
study indicates a strong association between drought stress and defoliation of
all four main tree species. Besides direct effects of weather conditions,
indirect effects seem to play a further role. Defoliation of the comparably
drought-tolerant species pine and oak was primarily affected by insect
infestations following drought whereas considerable time for regeneration was
required by beech following drought stress and recurring substantial
fructification. South-eastern Germany has emerged as the region with the
highest defoliation since the drought year 2003. This region was characterized
by the strongest water deficits in 2003 compared to the long-term reference
period. The present study gives evidence that the focus has moved from air
pollution to climate change. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal model was used to
carry out a simulation study to compare different survey grid resolutions. This
grid examination indicated that an 8 x 8 km grid instead of the standard 16 x
16 km grid is necessary for spatio-temporal trend estimation and for detecting
hot-spots in defoliation in space and time, especially regarding oak.

induced by the Hamiltonian of the system, decoherence effects due to atomic
spontaneous decay, and the measurement backaction. Within our approach we

of the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center, Sgr A*, at 1.3 mm (230
GHz). The observations were performed in 2013 March using six VLBI stations in
Hawaii, California, Arizona, and Chile. Compared to earlier observations, the
addition of the APEX telescope in Chile almost doubles the longest baseline
length in the array, provides additional {\it uv} coverage in the N-S
direction, and leads to a spatial resolution of $\sim$30 $\mu$as ($\sim$3
Schwarzschild radii) for Sgr A*. The source is detected even at the longest
baselines with visibility amplitudes of $\sim$4-13% of the total flux density.
We argue that such flux densities cannot result from interstellar refractive
scattering alone, but indicate the presence of compact intrinsic source
structure on scales of $\sim$3 Schwarzschild radii. The measured nonzero
closure phases rule out point-symmetric emission. We discuss our results in the

brightness distributions of disk- and jet-dominated models and show that both

asymmetry, the orientation, and characteristic sizes, which are comparable to

This correlates well to sample electrical transport properties, where a

the subfactor case. So we introduce a matrix dimension with the good functorial

out to be the square of the norm of the matrix dimension, as was known in the

learning, and have outperformed traditional algorithms on many benchmarks.
Training deep RNNs still remains a challenge, and most of the state-of-the-art
models are structured with a transition depth of 2-4 layers. Recurrent Highway
Networks (RHNs) were introduced in order to tackle this issue. These have
achieved state-of-the-art performance on a few benchmarks using a depth of 10
layers. However, the performance of this architecture suffers from a
bottleneck, and ceases to improve when an attempt is made to add more layers.
In this work, we analyze the causes for this, and postulate that the main
source is the way that the information flows through time. We introduce a novel
and simple variation for the RHN cell, called Highway State Gating (HSG), which
allows adding more layers, while continuing to improve performance. By using a
gating mechanism for the state, we allow the net to ""choose"" whether to pass
information directly through time, or to gate it. This mechanism also allows
the gradient to back-propagate directly through time and, therefore, results in
a slightly faster convergence. We use the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset as a
platform for empirical proof of concept. Empirical results show that the
improvement due to Highway State Gating is for all depths, and as the depth
increases, the improvement also increases.

launch propagating SPPPs in graphene/h-BN heterostructures on a piezoelectric

diffraction grating. The efficiency of the light coupling is greatly enhanced
by the introduction of the h-BN film as compared to the bare graphene/AlN
system. The h-BN interlayer not only significantly changes the dispersion of
the SPPPs but also enhances their lifetime. The strengthening of the SPPPs is
shown to be related to both the higher carrier mobility induced in graphene and
the coupling with h-BN and AlN surface phonons. In addition to surface phonons,
hyperbolic phonons appear in the case of multilayer h-BN films leading to
hybridized hyperbolic plasmon-phonon polaritons (HPPPs) that are also mediated
by the SAW. These results pave the way for engineering SAW-based graphene/h-BN
plasmonic devices and metamaterials covering the mid-IR to THz range.

approximately drawn from a union of subspaces, the goal is to group these data
points into their underlying subspaces. Many subspace clustering methods have
been proposed and among which sparse subspace clustering and low-rank
representation are two representative ones. Despite the different motivations,
we observe that many existing methods own the common block diagonal property,
which possibly leads to correct clustering, yet with their proofs given case by
case. In this work, we consider a general formulation and provide a unified
theoretical guarantee of the block diagonal property. The block diagonal
property of many existing methods falls into our special case. Second, we
observe that many existing methods approximate the block diagonal
representation matrix by using different structure priors, e.g., sparsity and
low-rankness, which are indirect. We propose the first block diagonal matrix
induced regularizer for directly pursuing the block diagonal matrix. With this
regularizer, we solve the subspace clustering problem by Block Diagonal
Representation (BDR), which uses the block diagonal structure prior. The BDR
model is nonconvex and we propose an alternating minimization solver and prove
its convergence. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
BDR.

increasingly important tool in data science with wide applications in many
engineering and scientific fields such as geoscience1-12, biology13 and the
financial industry14. The 4DVar seeks a solution that minimizes the departure
from the background field and the mismatch between the forecast trajectory and
the observations within an assimilation window. The current state-of-the-art
4DVar offers only two choices by using different forms of the forecast model:
the strong- and weak-constrained 4DVar approaches15-16. The former ignores the
model error and only corrects the initial condition error at the expense of
reduced accuracy; while the latter accounts for both the initial and model
errors and corrects them separately, which increases computational costs and
uncertainty. To overcome these limitations, here we develop an integral
correcting 4DVar (i4DVar) approach by treating all errors as a whole and
correcting them simultaneously and indiscriminately. To achieve that, a novel
exponentially decaying function is proposed to characterize the error evolution
and correct it at each time step in the i4DVar. As a result, the i4DVar greatly
enhances the capability of the strong-constrained 4DVar for correcting the
model error while also overcomes the limitation of the weak-constrained 4DVar
for being prohibitively expensive with added uncertainty. Numerical experiments
with the Lorenz model show that the i4DVar significantly outperforms the
existing 4DVar approaches. It has the potential to be applied in many
scientific and engineering fields and industrial sectors in the big data era
because of its ease of implementation and superior performance.

groups with the same disease but different subtypes for targeted treatments is
important for personalized and precision medicine. Approaches that incorporate
multi-omic data are more advantageous to those using only one data type for
patient clustering and disease subtype discovery. However, it is challenging to
integrate multi-omic data as they are heterogeneous and noisy. In this paper,
we present Affinity Network Fusion (ANF) to integrate multi-omic data for
patient clustering. ANF first constructs patient affinity networks for each
omic data type, and then calculates a fused network for spectral clustering. We
applied ANF to a processed harmonized cancer dataset downloaded from GDC data
portal consisting of 2193 patients, and generated promising results on
clustering patients into correct disease types. Moreover, we developed a
semi-supervised model combining ANF and neural network for few-shot learning.
In several cases, the model can achieve greater than 90% acccuracy on test set
with training less than 1% of the data. This demonstrates the power of ANF in

includes the quadrivariate GLMM as a special case and can also operate on the
original scale of sensitivities and specificities. The method allows the direct
calculation of sensitivity and specificity for each test, as well as, the
parameters of the summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve, along
with a comparison between the SROCs of each test. Our methodology is
demonstrated with an extensive simulation study and illustrated by
meta-analysing two examples where 2 tests for the diagnosis of a particular
disease are compared. Our study suggests that there can be an improvement on
GLMM in fit to data since our model can also provide tail dependencies and
asymmetries.

software, hardware, algorithms, and systems. GraphChallenge.org provides a wide

graph algorithms, example serial implementations in a variety of languages, and
specific metrics for measuring performance. Graph Challenge 2017 received 22
submissions by 111 authors from 36 organizations. The submissions highlighted
graph analytic innovations in hardware, software, algorithms, systems, and
visualization. These submissions produced many comparable performance
measurements that can be used for assessing the current state of the art of the
field. There were numerous submissions that implemented the triangle counting
challenge and resulted in over 350 distinct measurements. Analysis of these
submissions show that their execution time is a strong function of the number
of edges in the graph, $N_e$, and is typically proportional to $N_e^{4/3}$ for
large values of $N_e$. Combining the model fits of the submissions presents a
picture of the current state of the art of graph analysis, which is typically
$10^8$ edges processed per second for graphs with $10^8$ edges. These results
are $30$ times faster than serial implementations commonly used by many graph
analysts and underscore the importance of making these performance benefits
available to the broader community. Graph Challenge provides a clear picture of
current graph analysis systems and underscores the need for new innovations to
achieve high performance on very large graphs.

remains a popular simulation tool both for analysis of $p$-$p$ collision

all produced hadrons result from parton-parton scatterings (interactions)
described by pQCD (a hard component), and that multiple parton interactions per
collision event (MPIs) are a common occurrence. In contrast, a two-component
(soft + hard) model (TCM) of high-energy collisions, inferred inductively from
a variety of data formats, attributes a majority of final-state hadrons to a
soft component (projectile-nucleon dissociation) and a minority to a hard
component representing minimum-bias dijet production (corresponding to measured
jet spectra and fragmentation functions). The hard-component hadron yield is
precisely proportional to the square of the soft-component yield over an
interval corresponding to 100-fold increase in dijet production. The two data
descriptions appear to be in conflict. This study presents a detailed
comparison of the two models and their relations to a broad array of collision
data. The PMC appears to disagree with some data, whereas the TCM provides an

achievements of the transport in dense quantum gases with the Landau theory of

motion appear which are hidden usually in non-Markovian behaviors. The
remaining corrections are expressed in terms of shifts in space and time that
characterize the non-locality of the scattering process. In this way quantum
transport is possible to recast into a quasi-classical picture. The balance
equations for the density, momentum, energy and entropy include besides
quasiparticle also the correlated two-particle contributions beyond the Landau

heat, i.e., an energy conversion between correlation and thermal energy. For
Maxwellian particles with time-dependent s-wave scattering, the correlated
parts of the observables are calculated and a sign change of the latent heat is
reported at a universal ratio of scattering length to the thermal De Broglie
wavelength. This is interpreted as a change from correlational heating to

in a patient is of great value in planning treatments. It is known that
\textit{decision parameters} such as cadence, step length, and walking speed
are critical in the diagnosis of gait disorders in patients. This project aims
to predict the decision parameters using two ways and afterwards giving advice
on whether a patient needs treatment or not. In one way, we use clinically
measured parameters such as Ankle Dorsiflexion, age, walking speed, step
length, stride length, weight over height squared (BMI) and etc. to predict the
decision parameters. In a second way, we use videos recorded from patient's
walking tests in a clinic in order to extract the coordinates of the joints of
the patient over time and predict the decision parameters. Finally, having the
decision parameters we pre-classify gait disorder intensity of a patient and as
the result make decisions on whether a patient needs treatment or not.

  Anagnostopoulos, Gregory Kalogiannis","Introducing an innovative robot-based mobile platform for programming
  learning","6 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.CY cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present study introduces an Android based application that focuses on
promoting students' learning experience when interacting with Lego Mindstorms
Robotic Kit NXT. A thorough investigation of the current literature reveals
that there are numerous applications attempting to overcome the limitations of
Lego platform which, however, appear to only partially succeed in significantly
improving children's engagement in fruitful learning. Their main limitations
are that they either function on an elemental level or suffer from a general
lack of creating effectively room for children to test their abilities and
other curiosities. Aiming at confronting these limitations, the proposed
android application, which is referred to as MyNXT, was created and presented.
MyNXT offers direct access control along with the choice to program using
simple linear logic through an easy and a user friendly environment with built
in instructions for all ages. Concluding, the proposed application constitutes
a stepping to an educating platform, which can facilitate the learning needs of
children in contemporary times.
