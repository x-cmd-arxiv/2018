allowing for the evolution of large, complex organisms. While multicellularity
can be strongly advantageous, its earliest stages bring unique physical
challenges. Nascent multicellular organisms must contend with a novel
constraint: intercellular stresses arising from cell-cell interactions that can
limit multicellular size. Among the possible evolutionary routes to overcoming
this size limit, two appear obvious: multicellular organisms can increase
intercellular bond strength, allowing them to tolerate larger stresses, or,
they can slow the rate of stress accumulation by altering their internal
structure. Recent experiments demonstrated that multicellular 'snowflake yeast'
readily find a solution to this problem via the latter route. By evolving more
elongated cells, which decreases cellular packing fraction and thus the rate of
internal stress accumulation during growth, snowflake yeast evolve to delay
fracture and grow larger. However, it is unclear if snowflake yeast evolved
large size along an optimal path, or if the observed path to large size was
taken due to proximate biological reasons. Here, we examine the geometric
efficiency of both strategies using a minimal model that was previously
demonstrated to replicate many experimentally observed structural properties of
snowflake yeast. We find that changing geometry is a far more efficient route
to large size than evolving increased intercellular adhesion. In fact,
increasing cellular aspect ratio is on average ~13 times more effective at
increasing the number of cells in a cluster than increasing bond strength.
These results suggest that geometrically-imposed physical constraints may have
been a key early selective force guiding the emergence of multicellular
complexity.

imaging plays a key role in lung disease diagnosis and determining treatment
plans for the patients. Doctors needs to make a decision whether to biopsy the
patients timely when performing bronchoscopy. However, the doctors also needs
to be very selective with biopsies as biopsies may cause uncontrollable
bleeding of the lung tissue which is life-threaten. To help doctors to be more
selective on biopsies and provide a second opinion on diagnosis, in this work,
we propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for lung diseases including
cancers and tuberculosis (TB). The system is developed based on transfer
learning. We propose a novel transfer learning method: sentential fine-tuning .
Compared to traditional fine-tuning methods, our methods achieves the best
performance. We obtained a overall accuracy of 77.0% a dataset of 81 normal
cases, 76 tuberculosis cases and 277 lung cancer cases while the other
traditional transfer learning methods achieve an accuracy of 73% and 68%. . The
detection accuracy of our method for cancers, TB and normal cases are 87%, 54%
and 91% respectively. This indicates that the CAD system has potential to
improve lung disease diagnosis accuracy in bronchoscopy and it also might be
used to be more selective with biopsies.

matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis, according to which the entropy of a
closed quantum gravitational system is equal to the system's matter-gravity
entanglement entropy. The main arguments presented are: (1) this hypothesis is
capable of resolving the second-law puzzle, i.e. the puzzle as to how the
entropy increase of a closed system can be reconciled with the asssumption of
unitary time-evolution; (2) the black hole information loss puzzle may be
regarded as a special case of this second law puzzle and therefore the same
resolution applies to it; (3) the black hole thermal atmosphere puzzle (which I
recall) can be resolved by adopting a radically different-from-usual
description of quantum black hole equilibrium states, according to which they
are total pure states, entangled between matter and gravity so that the partial
states of matter and gravity are each approximately thermal equilibrium states
(at the Hawking temperature); (4) the Susskind-Horowitz-Polchinski
string-theoretic understanding of black hole entropy as the logarithm of the
degeneracy of a long string (which is the weak string coupling limit of a black
hole) cannot be correct but should be replaced by a modified understanding
according to which it is the entanglement entropy between a long string and its
stringy atmosphere, when in a total pure equilibrium state in a suitable box,
which (in line with (3)) goes over, at strong-coupling, to a black hole in
equilibrium with its thermal atmosphere. The modified understanding in (4) is
based on a general result, which I describe, about the likely state of a
quantum system weakly coupled to an energy-bath when the total state is a
random pure state with given energy. This result generalizes Goldstein et al.'s
'canonical typicality' result to systems which are not necessarily small.

  Nested risk measures are built on risk measures, which originate by

shortest path, traveling salesman problem, etc. A classical problem in discrete
planning is to consider a weighted graph and construct a path that maximizes
the sum of weights for a given time horizon $T$. However, in many scenarios,
the time horizon is not fixed, but the stopping time is chosen according to
some distribution such that the expected stopping time is $T$. If the stopping
time distribution is not known, then to ensure robustness, the distribution is
chosen by an adversary, to represent the worst-case scenario.
  A stationary plan for every vertex always chooses the same outgoing edge. For
fixed horizon or fixed stopping-time distribution, stationary plans are not
sufficient for optimality. Quite surprisingly we show that when an adversary
chooses the stopping-time distribution with expected stopping time $T$, then
stationary plans are sufficient. While computing optimal stationary plans for
fixed horizon is NP-complete, we show that computing optimal stationary plans
under adversarial stopping-time distribution can be achieved in polynomial
time. Consequently, our polynomial-time algorithm for adversarial stopping time
also computes an optimal plan among all possible plans.

been analyzed in previous works. However, the case of multiple-step lookahead
policy improvement, despite the recent increase in empirical evidence of its
strength, has to our knowledge not been carefully analyzed yet. In this work,
we introduce the first such analysis. Namely, we formulate variants of
multiple-step policy improvement, derive new algorithms using these definitions
and prove their convergence. Moreover, we show that recent prominent
Reinforcement Learning algorithms are, in fact, instances of our framework. We
thus shed light on their empirical success and give a recipe for deriving new
algorithms for future study.

bodies. Regolith production via impact cratering has long been a key topic of
study since the Apollo era. The evolution of regolith due to impact cratering,
however, is not well understood. A better formulation is needed to help
quantify the formation mechanism and timescale of regolith evolution. Here, we
propose an analytically derived stochastic model that describes the evolution
of regolith generated by small, simple craters. We account for ejecta
blanketing as well as regolith infilling of the transient crater cavity. Our
results show that the regolith infilling plays a key role in producing
regolith. Our model demonstrates that, because of the stochastic nature of
impact cratering, the regolith thickness varies laterally, which is consistent
with earlier work. We apply this analytical model to the regolith evolution at
the Apollo 15 site. The regolith thickness is computed considering the observed
crater size-frequency distribution of small, simple lunar craters (< 381 m in
radius for ejecta blanketing and < 100 m in radius for the regolith infilling).
Allowing for some amount of regolith coming from the outside of the area, our
result is consistent with an empirical result from the Apollo 15 seismic
experiment. Finally, we find that the timescale of regolith growth is longer
than that of crater equilibrium, implying that even if crater equilibrium is
observed on a cratered surface, it is likely the regolith thickness is still
evolving due to additional impact craters.

environment, adapt to the environmental conditions, and use the radio spectrum
more efficiently. It allows secondary users (SUs) to use the primary users
(PUs) channels when they are not being utilized. Cognitive radio involves three
main processes: spectrum sensing, deciding, and acting. In the spectrum sensing
process, the channel occupancy is measured with spectrum sensing techniques in
order to detect unused channels. In the deciding process, sensing results are
analyzed and decisions are made based on these results. In the acting process,
actions are made by adjusting the transmission parameters to enhance the
cognitive radio performance.
  One of the main challenges of cognitive radio is the wideband spectrum
sensing. Existing spectrum sensing techniques are based on a set of
observations sampled by an ADC at the Nyquist rate. However, those techniques
can sense only one channel at a time because of the hardware limitations on the
sampling rate. In addition, in order to sense a wideband spectrum, the wideband
is divided into narrow bands or multiple frequency bands. SUs have to sense
each band using multiple RF frontends simultaneously, which can result in a
very high processing time, hardware cost, and computational complexity. In
order to overcome this problem, the signal sampling should be as fast as
possible even with high dimensional signals. Compressive sensing has been
proposed as a low-cost solution to reduce the processing time and accelerate
the scanning process. It allows reducing the number of samples required for
high dimensional signal acquisition while keeping the essential information.

problems by iteratively breaking them down into smaller subproblems. In spite
of their versatility, DP algorithms are usually non-differentiable, which

address this issue, we propose to smooth the max operator in the dynamic

relax both the optimal value and solution of the original combinatorial

fractal if the scaling of far more small things than large ones recurs at least
twice. The scaling can be rephrased as a hierarchy, consisting of numerous

The logarithmic spiral, as a smooth curve, is apparently fractal because it
bears the self-similar property, or the scaling of far more small squares than
large ones recurs multiple times, or the scaling of far more small bends than
large ones recurs multiple times. A half-circle or half-ellipse and the UK

a difficult problem in real-time crash likelihood prediction, since it is hard
to distinguish crash-prone cases from non-crash cases which compose the
majority of the observed samples. In this paper, principal component analysis
(PCA) based approaches, including LS-PCA, PPCA, and VBPCA, are employed for
imputing missing values, while two kinds of solutions are developed to solve
the problem in imbalanced data. The results show that PPCA and VBPCA not only
outperform LS-PCA and other imputation methods (including mean imputation and
k-means clustering imputation), in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE),

solving the problem is computationally prohibitive. Approximate low-complexity
solutions for ARM have recently attracted much research interest. In this
paper, we design an iterative algorithm for ARM based on message passing

by the recently developed turbo compressed sensing algorithm for sparse signal

We also show that TARM converges much faster than the counterpart algorithms
for low-rank matrix recovery. We further extend the TARM algorithm for matrix

Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem to determine the frequency
division multiplexed preambles, where the objective is to minimize the mean
square error (MSE) of the channel estimation, subject to the constraint on the
transmit energy. For two transmit antennas, we find the relationship between
preambles and the intrinsic interference from neighboring symbols to achieve
the minimum channel estimation MSE, and derive the optimal closed-form
solution. For more than two transmit antennas, the constrained preamble
optimization problem is nonconvex quadratic. Therefore, we convert the original
optimization problem into a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP)
and obtain the suboptimal solution by relaxing the nonconvex constraint.
Simulation results demonstrate that, in terms of MSE and bit error rate (BER)
performances, the proposed method outperforms the conventional FDM preamble
design method at all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes and outperforms the
interference approximation method-complex (IAM-C) preamble design method at low

weights along the path) in the neural network is invariant to positive scaling
and prove that the value vector of all the paths is sufficient to represent the

components. A highly desirable geometry for such applications is a coil.
However, coiled nanotube structures reported so far were inherently defective
or had no free ends accessible for contacting. Here we demonstrate the
spontaneous self-coiling of single-wall carbon nanotubes into defect-free coils
of up to more than 70 turns with identical diameter and chirality, and free
ends. We characterize the structure, formation mechanism, and electrical
properties of these coils by different microscopies, molecular dynamics
simulations, Raman spectroscopy, and electrical and magnetic measurements. The
coils are highly conductive, as expected for defect-free carbon nanotubes, but
adjacent nanotube segments in the coil are more highly coupled than in regular
bundles of single-wall carbon nanotubes, owing to their perfect crystal
momentum matching, which enables tunneling between the turns. Although this
behavior does not yet enable the performance of these nanotube coils as
inductive devices, it does point a clear path for their realization. Hence,
this study represents a major step toward the production of many different
nanotube coil devices, including inductors, electromagnets, transformers, and
dynamos.

philosophical logic. Their meanings are so close that they are mixed sometimes,

necessary to study them in a unified framework. However, there has been no
logical research on them together. In this paper, we propose a language of a
bimodal logic with these two concepts, investigate its model-theoretical
properties such as expressivity and frame definability. We axiomatize this
logic over various classes of frames, whose completeness proofs are shown with
the help of a crucial schema. The interactions between contingency and accident
can sharpen our understanding of both notions. Then we extend the logic to a
dynamic case: public announcements. By finding the required reduction axioms,
we obtain a complete axiomatization, which gives us a good application to Moore

states $\Phi=\{\ket{\phi_i}\}$ and the corresponding occurrence probabilities
$\eta=\{\eta_i\}$. To any such problem we associate, up to a permutation over
the probabilities $\{\eta_i\}$, a unique pair of density matrices
$\boldsymbol{\rho_{_{T}}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\eta_{{p}}}$ defined on the
$N$-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_N$. The first one,
$\boldsymbol{\rho_{_{T}}}$, provides a new parametrization of a generic
full-rank density matrix in terms of the parameters of the discrimination
problem, i.e. the mutual overlaps $\gamma_{ij}=\bra{\phi_i}\phi_j\rangle$ and
the occurrence probabilities $\{\eta_i\}$. The second one is defined as a
diagonal density matrix $\boldsymbol{\eta_p}$ with the diagonal entries given
by the probabilities $\{\eta_i\}$ with the ordering induced by the permutation
$p$ of the probabilities. $\boldsymbol{\rho_{_{T}}}$ and
$\boldsymbol{\eta_{{p}}}$ capture information about the quantum and classical
versions of the discrimination problem, respectively. In this sense, when the
set $\Phi$ can be discriminated unambiguously with probability one, i.e. when
the states to be discriminated are mutually orthogonal and can be distinguished
by a classical observer, then $\boldsymbol{\rho_{_{T}}}\rightarrow
\boldsymbol{\eta_{{p}}}$. Moreover, if the set lacks its independency and
cannot be discriminated anymore the distinguishability of the pair, measured by
the fidelity $F(\boldsymbol{\rho_{_{T}}}, \boldsymbol{\eta_{{p}}})$, becomes
minimum. This enables one to associate to each discrimination problem a measure
of discriminability defined by the fidelity $F(\boldsymbol{\rho_{_{T}}},
\boldsymbol{\eta_{{p}}})$. This quantity, has the advantage of being easy to
calculate and in this respect it can find useful applications in estimating the
extent to which the set is discriminable.

the non-adaptive Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamformer. However, the quality of the
reconstructed PA images obtained by DAS is not satisfying due to its high level
of sidelobes and wide mainlobe. In contrast, adaptive beamformers, such as
minimum variance (MV), result in an improved image compared to DAS. In this
paper, a novel beamforming method, called Double MV (D-MV) is proposed to
enhance the image quality compared to the MV. It is shown that there is a
summation procedure between the weighted subarrays in the output of the MV
beamformer. This summation can be interpreted as the non-adaptive DAS
beamformer. It is proposed to replace the existing DAS with the MV algorithm to
reduce the contribution of the off-axis signals caused by the DAS beamformer
between the weighted subarrays. The numerical results show that the proposed
technique improves the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) and signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) for about 28.83 \mu m and 4.8 dB in average, respectively, compared to MV
beamformer. Also, quantitative evaluation of the experimental results indicates
that the proposed D-MV leads to 0.15 mm and 1.96 dB improvement in FWHM and
SNR, in comparison with MV beamformer.

the dependence of shear stress on body mass. In the case of a Poiseuille
modeling of the blood flow, P. Weinberg and C. Ethier have shown that shear
stress on the aortic endothelium varies like body mass to the power
$-\frac{3}{8}$, and is therefore 20-fold higher in mice than in men. However,
by considering a more physiological oscillating Poiseuille + Womersley
combinated flow in the aorta, we show that results differ notably: at larger
masses ($M>10 \ kg$) shear stress varies as body mass to the power
$-\frac{1}{8}$ and modifies the man to mouse ratio to 1:8. The allometry and
values of temporal gradient of shear stress also change: $\partial\tau/\partial
t$ varies as $M^{-3/8}$ instead of $M^{-5/8}$ at larger masses, and the 1:150
ratio from man to mouse becomes 1:61. Lastly, we show that the unsteady
component of blood flow does not influence the constant allometry of peak
velocity on body mass: $u_{max} \propto M^{0}$. This work extends our knowledge
on the dependence of hemodynamic parameters on body mass and paves the way for
a more precise extrapolation of in-vivo measurements to humans and bigger
mammals.

by Nielsen, Plotkin and Winskel, they are used to establish a bridge between
the theory of domains and the approach to concurrency proposed by Petri. A
basic role is played by an unfolding construction that maps (safe) Petri nets
into a subclass of event structures, called prime event structures, where each
event has a uniquely determined set of causes. Prime event structures, in turn,
can be identified with their domain of configurations. At a categorical level,
this is nicely formalised by Winskel as a chain of coreflections.
  Contrary to prime event structures, general event structures allow for the
presence of disjunctive causes, i.e., events can be enabled by distinct minimal
sets of events. In this paper, we extend the connection between Petri nets and
event structures in order to include disjunctive causes. In particular, we show
that, at the level of nets, disjunctive causes are well accounted for by
persistent places. These are places where tokens, once generated, can be used
several times without being consumed and where multiple tokens are interpreted
collectively, i.e., their histories are inessential. Generalising the work on
ordinary nets, Petri nets with persistence are related to a new subclass of
general event structures, called locally connected, by means of a chain of
coreflections relying on an unfolding construction.

resistive behavior all the way down to low temperatures. Magnetoresistance
versus temperature of the superconductive ones showed the typical peak due to
flux flow against pinning below $\rm T_c$, while the resistive ones showed only
the broad leading edge of such a peak. All this indicates clearly weak-link
superconductivity in the resistive bridges between superconductive $\rm

in the center of a globular cluster (GC) or a nuclear star cluster (NSC), and
is known as an intermediate- or extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (IMRI or EMRI).
Motivated by the recent suggestions that dark matter minispikes could form
around IMBHs, we study the effect of dynamical friction against DM on the
merger rate of IMRIs/EMRIs. We find that the merger timescale of IMBHs with BHs
and NSs would be shortened by two to three orders of magnitude. As a result,
the event rate of IMRIs/EMRIs are enhanced by orders of magnitude relative to
that in the case of no DM minispikes. In the most extreme case where IMBHs are
small and the DM minispikes have a steep density profile, all the BH in GCs and
NSCs might be exhausted so that the mergers with NSs would dominate the current
IMRIs/EMRIs. Our results suggest that the mass function of the IMBHs below
$10^4 \,M_\odot$ would bear imprints of the distribution of DM minispikes
because these low-mass IMBHs can grow efficiently in the presence of DM
minispikes by merging with BHs and NSs. Future space-based GW detectors, like
LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin, can measure the IMRI/EMRI rate and hence constrain

by manipulating the 2D interactions without applying external magnetic or

  The model is based on a category of covariant presheaves over a category of

coinductive types, types must be interpreted as presheaves orthogonal to the
object of clocks. In the case of dependent types, this translates to a lifting
condition similar to the one found in homotopy theoretic models of type theory,
but here with an additional requirement of uniqueness of lifts. Since the
universes defined by the standard Hofmann-Streicher construction in this model
do not satisfy this property, the universes in GDTT must be indexed by contexts
of clock variables. We show how to model these universes in such a way that

functioning and well being of the modern society, and can be modeled as
minority games. A ubiquitous dynamical phenomenon is the emergence of herding,
where a vast majority of the users concentrate on a small number of resources,
leading to a low efficiency in resource allocation. To devise strategies to
prevent herding is thus of high interest. Previous works focused on control
strategies that rely on external interventions, such as pinning control where a
fraction of users are forced to choose a certain action. Is it possible to
eliminate herding without any external control? The main point of this paper is
to provide an affirmative answer through exploiting artificial intelligence
(AI). In particular, we demonstrate that, when agents are empowered with
reinforced learning in that they get familiar with the unknown game environment
gradually and attempt to deliver the optimal actions to maximize the payoff,
herding can effectively be eliminated. Computations reveal the striking
phenomenon that, regardless of the initial state, the system evolves
persistently and relentlessly toward the optimal state in which all resources
are used efficiently. However, the evolution process is not without
interruptions: there are large fluctuations that occur but only intermittently
in time. The statistical distribution of the time between two successive
fluctuating events is found to depend on the parity of the evolution, i.e.,
whether the number of time steps in between is odd or even. We develop a
physical analysis and derive mean-field equations to gain an understanding of
these phenomena. As minority game dynamics and the phenomenon of herding are
common in social, economic, and political systems, and since AI is becoming
increasingly widespread, we expect our AI empowered minority game system to

dermatological conditions, aimed at people without easy access to skin
specialists. We report approximately 80% accuracy, in a situation where primary
care doctors have attained 57% success rate, according to recent literature.
The rationale of its design is centered on deploying and updating it on
handheld devices in near future. Dermatological diseases are common in every
population and have a wide spectrum in severity. With a shortage of
dermatological expertise being observed in several countries, machine learning
solutions can augment medical services and advise regarding existence of common
diseases. The paper implements supervised classification of nine distinct
conditions which have high occurrence in East Asian countries. Our current
attempt establishes that deep learning based techniques are viable avenues for
preliminary information to aid patients.

  Large Action Spaces",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In spoken dialogue systems, we aim to deploy artificial intelligence to build
automated dialogue agents that can converse with humans. A part of this effort
is the policy optimisation task, which attempts to find a policy describing how
to respond to humans, in the form of a function taking the current state of the
dialogue and returning the response of the system. In this paper, we
investigate deep reinforcement learning approaches to solve this problem.
Particular attention is given to actor-critic methods, off-policy reinforcement
learning with experience replay, and various methods aimed at reducing the bias
and variance of estimators. When combined, these methods result in the
previously proposed ACER algorithm that gave competitive results in gaming
environments. These environments however are fully observable and have a
relatively small action set so in this paper we examine the application of ACER
to dialogue policy optimisation. We show that this method beats the current
state-of-the-art in deep learning approaches for spoken dialogue systems. This
not only leads to a more sample efficient algorithm that can train faster, but
also allows us to apply the algorithm in more difficult environments than
before. We thus experiment with learning in a very large action space, which
has two orders of magnitude more actions than previously considered. We find
that ACER trains significantly faster than the current state-of-the-art.

is unlike the General Relativity case. The agreement found points in the
direction that Unimodular Gravity and General Relativity give rise to the same

which induce the capital flows between economic systems, is proposed. The
proposals appeal to an apparatus offered by the statistical theory of shape. We
propose a stress functional basing on a concept of mean shape determined by
representative particles of a capital carrier. We also propose methods of
describing changes in an amount and a structure of stresses in a capital
appealing, among others, to a Bookstein's pair of thin plain spline
deformation, and a measure of a shape variability. We apply our approach to an
indirect verification of the hypothesis according to which a capital flow
between economic systems is related to an activity of an inner force related to
stresses in a capital. We indicate, that the stresses create a phenomenon
analogous to the heat, which may be interpreted in terms of a positive economic
external effect, which attracts a capital from environment of a system to the
system. For empirical studies we propose robust approach to estimate the stress
functional basing on the data depth concept. In the empirical research we use
data on five branch stock indexes from Warsaw Stock Exchange. The studied
period involves the financial crisis of 2007.

the effectiveness of our method in diagnosing machine learning models on

driving force in altering human biology. Besides, human activities already
proved to have a significant impact on the Earth system which in turn generates
complex feedback loops between social and ecological systems. Furthermore,
since our species evolved relatively fast from small groups of hunter-gatherers
to large and technology-intensive urban agglomerations, it is not a surprise
that the major institutions of human society are no longer fit to cope with the
present complexity. In this note we draw foundational parallelisms between
neurophysiological systems and ICT-enabled social systems, discussing how
frameworks rooted in biology and physics could provide heuristic value in the
design of evolutionary systems relevant to politics and economics. In this
regard we highlight how the governance of emerging technology (i.e.
nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science),
and the one of climate change both presently confront us with a number of
connected challenges. In particular: historically high level of inequality; the
co-existence of growing multipolar cultural systems in an unprecedentedly
connected world; the unlikely reaching of the institutional agreements required
to deviate abnormal trajectories of development. We argue that wise general
solutions to such interrelated issues should embed the deep understanding of
how to elicit mutual incentives in the socio-economic subsystems of Earth
system in order to jointly concur to a global utility function (e.g. avoiding
the reach of planetary boundaries and widespread social unrest). We leave some
open questions on how techno-social systems can effectively learn and adapt
with respect to our understanding of geopolitical complexity.

a small parameter~$\varepsilon$ at the highest derivative are described. These
problems essentially (qualitatively and quantitatively) differ from the usual
linear and quasilinear singularly perturbed boundary-value problems and have
the following unusual properties:
  (i) in hypersingular boundary-value problems, super thin boundary layers
arise, and the derivative at the boundary layer can have very large values of
the order of $e^{1/\varepsilon}$ and more (in standard problems with boundary
layers, the derivative at the boundary has the order of $\varepsilon^{-1}$ or
less);
  (ii) in hypersingular boundary-value problems, the position of the boundary
layer is determined by the values of the unknown function at the boundaries (in
standard problems with boundary layers, the position of the boundary layer is
determined by coefficients of the given equation, and the values of the unknown
function at the boundaries do not play a role here);
  (iii) hypersingular boundary-value problems do not admit a direct application
of the method of matched asymptotic expansions (without a preliminary nonlinear
point transformation of the equation under consideration).
  Examples of hypersingular nonlinear boundary-value problems with ODEs and
PDEs are given and their exact solutions are obtained. It is important to note
that the exact solutions presented in this paper can be used to compare the
effectiveness of various methods of numerical integration of singularly
perturbed problems with boundary layers, and also to develop new numerical and
approximate analytical methods.

threshold Sweet-Parker type stationary reconnecting configurations become
unstable to a fast tearing mode dominated by plasmoid generation. It is known
that the flow along the sheet plays a stabilizing role, though a satisfactory
explanation of the non-universality and variable critical Lundquist numbers
observed is still lacking. Here we discuss this question using 2D linear MHD
simulations and linear stability analyses of Sweet-Parker type current sheets
in the presence of background stationary inflows and outflows at low Lundquist
numbers ($S\le 10^4$). Simulations show that the inhomogeneous outflow
stabilizes the current sheet by stretching the growing magnetic islands and at
the same time evacuating the magnetic islands out of the current sheet. This
limits the time during which fluctuations which begin at any given wave-length
can remain unstable, rendering the instability non-exponential. We find that
the linear theory based on the expanding-wavelength assumption works well for
$S$ larger than $\sim 1000$. However we also find that the inflow and location
of the initial perturbation also affect the stability threshold.

elasticity theory. In the first version, Lagrange interpolation is assumed in
$x$ and $y$ directions and the second version is based on mixed interpolation,
with Lagrange interpolation in $x$ direction and Hermite interpolation in $y$
