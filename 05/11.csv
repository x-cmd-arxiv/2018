toward education and public outreach (EPO) using 131 survey responses from
members of the Dark Energy Survey. We find a disparity between the types of EPO
activities researchers deem valuable and those in which they participate. Most
respondents are motivated to engage in EPO by a desire to educate the public.
Barriers to engagement include career- and skill-related concerns, but lack of
time is the main deterrent. We explore the value of centralized EPO efforts and
conclude with a list of recommendations for increasing researchers' engagement.

the advantage of quantum technologies over their classical counterparts.
Recently, coherence has been recast as a resource theory in an attempt to
identify and quantify it in an operationally well-defined manner. Here we study
how the coherence present in a state can be used to implement a quantum channel
via incoherent operations and, in turn, to assess its degree of coherence. We
introduce the robustness of coherence of a quantum channel---which reduces to
the homonymous measure for states when computed on constant-output
channels---and prove that: i) it quantifies the minimal rank of a maximally
coherent state required to implement the channel; ii) its logarithm quantifies
the amortized cost of implementing the channel provided some coherence is
recovered at the output; iii) its logarithm also quantifies the zero-error
asymptotic cost of implementation of many independent copies of a channel. We
also consider the generalized problem of imperfect implementation with
arbitrary resource states. Using the robustness of coherence, we find that in
general a quantum channel can be implemented without employing a maximally
coherent resource state. In fact, we prove that \textit{every} pure coherent
state in dimension larger than $2$, however weakly so, turns out to be a
valuable resource to implement \textit{some} coherent unitary channel. We
illustrate our findings for the case of single-qubit unitary channels.

We demonstrate that spectrometers provide several benefits for material

To explore this, we collected a dataset of spectral measurements from two
commercially available spectrometers during which a robotic platform interacted
with 50 flat material objects, and we show that a neural network model can
accurately analyze these measurements. Due to the similarity between
consecutive spectral measurements, our model achieved a material classification
accuracy of 94.6% when given only one spectral sample per object. Similar to
prior works with haptic sensors, we found that generalizing material
recognition to new objects posed a greater challenge, for which we achieved an
accuracy of 79.1% via leave-one-object-out cross-validation. Finally, we
demonstrate how a PR2 robot can leverage spectrometers to estimate the

858 K and transitions from the semiconducting-liquid phase to the
metallic-liquid phase at ~ 930 K at equilibrium. The simultaneous Seebeck (S)
and resistivity versus temperature measurements of amorphous-fcc mixed-phase
GST thin-films show linear S-T trends that meet S = 0 at 0 K, consistent with
degenerate semiconductors, and the dS/dT and room temperature activation energy
show a linear correlation. The single-crystal fcc is calculated to have dS/dT =
0.153 {\mu}V/K for an activation energy of zero and a Fermi level 0.16 eV below
the valance band edge.

appear naturally in many contexts, such as model checking, motion planning,
enumeration and sampling, and recreational mathematics. We provide hardness
results for problems in this family, in which the constraints and operations
are particularly simple. More precisely, we prove the PSPACE-completeness of
the following decision problems:
  $\bullet$ Given two satisfying assignments to a planar monotone instance of
Not-All-Equal 3-SAT, can one assignment be transformed into the other by single
variable `flips' (assignment changes), preserving satisfiability at every step?
  $\bullet$ Given two subsets of a set S of integers with the same sum, can one
subset be transformed into the other by adding or removing at most three
elements of S at a time, such that the intermediate subsets also have the same
sum?
  $\bullet$ Given two points in $\{0,1\}^n$ contained in a polytope P specified
by a constant number of linear inequalities, is there a path in the n-hypercube
connecting the two points and contained in P?
  These problems can be interpreted as reconfiguration analogues of standard
problems in NP. Interestingly, the instances of the NP problems that appear as
input to the reconfiguration problems in our reductions can be shown to lie in
P. In particular, the elements of S and the coefficients of the inequalities
defining P can be restricted to have logarithmic bit-length.

For positive tangential pressure, the shell around a black hole may eventually
collapse onto the black hole, or expand to infinity, or have a static but
unstable solution, depending on the combination of black hole mass, mass of the
shell and the pressure parameter. For vanishing or negative pressure, the shell
will collapse onto the black hole. For all eventually collapsing solutions, the

group theory, algebraic combinatorics, and probability. In particular the
Plancherel measure is a probability that arises naturally from representation
theory, and in this thesis we consider three ramifications of asymptotic
questions for random Plancherel distributed representations. First we recall
irreducible characters of the symmetric group, which are indexed by integer
partitions. We focus on the so called 'dual approach', in which the partition
indexing a character is now considered to be the variable. We extend a famous
result of Kerov on the asymptotic of Plancherel distributed characters by
studying partial trace and partial sum of a representation matrix. We decompose
each of these objects into a main term and a remainder, and in each case we
prove a central limit theorem for the main term. We apply these results to
prove a law of large numbers for the partial sum. In the second part we
consider projective representations of the symmetric group by converting a
multirectangular approach developed by Stanley for the classical case. In
particular, we present a positivity conjecture for the coefficients of the
renormalized projective character, written as a polynomial in a new set of
coordinates. We prove the positivity for the leading term of the polynomial. In
the last part of the thesis we recall the theory of supercharacters, which is
an alternative tool to representation theory when the classical approach proves
to be intractable. We show that a generalization of the Plancherel measure,
called the superplancherel measure, arises naturally. We focus on a particular
supercharacter theory for the upper unitriangular group in which
supercharacters are indexed by set partitions. We prove a limit shape result
for a random set partition according to this distribution.

Telescope observations of planet-bearing stars. Using a simple four-parameter
blackbody thermal model, we analyze stars for which photometry in at least one
of Spitzer's IRAC bands has been obtained over either the entirety or a
significant fraction of the planetary orbit. Systems in this category comprise
ten well-studied systems with Hot Jupiters on circular or near-circular orbits
(HAT-P-7, HD 149026, HD 189733, HD 209458, WASP-12, WASP-14, WASP-18, WASP-19,
WASP-33, and WASP-43), as well as three stars harboring planets on
significantly eccentric orbits (GJ 436, HAT-P-2, and HD 80606). We find that
our simple model, in almost all cases, accurately reproduces the minimum and
maximum planetary emission, as well as the phase offsets of these extrema with
respect to transits/secondary eclipses. For one notable exception, WASP-12 b,
adding an additional parameter to account for its tidal distortion is not
sufficient to reproduce its photometric features. Full-orbit photometry is
available in multiple wavelengths for 10 planets. We find that the returned
parameter values for independent fits to each band are largely in agreement.
However, disagreements in night-side temperature suggest distinct atmospheric
layers, each with their own characteristic minimum temperature. In addition, a
diversity in albedos suggests variation in opacity of the photospheres. While
previous works have pointed out trends in photometric features based on system
properties, we cannot conclusively identify analogous trends for physical model
parameters. To make the connection between full-phase data and physical models
more robust, a higher signal-to-noise must come from both increased resolution
and a careful treatment of instrumental systematics.

pattern recognition methods and a sample of galaxy spectra from the Sloan

width of [OIII] (5007\AA) and H$\beta$, along with the 4000\AA-break, can be

this survey, for example, $\rm{g - r}$ colour can provide the same accuracy as
galaxy stellar mass to predict whether or not a galaxy hosts an AGN. Finally,

importance of model choice continues to grow as phylogenetic models continue to
increase in complexity to better capture micro and macroevolutionary processes.
In a Bayesian framework, the marginal likelihood is how data update our prior
beliefs about models, which gives us an intuitive measure of comparing model
fit that is grounded in probability theory. Given the rapid increase in the
number and complexity of phylogenetic models, methods for approximating
marginal likelihoods are increasingly important. Here we try to provide an
intuitive description of marginal likelihoods and why they are important in
Bayesian model testing. We also categorize and review methods for estimating
marginal likelihoods of phylogenetic models, highlighting several recent
methods that provide well-behaved estimates. Furthermore, we review some
empirical studies that demonstrate how marginal likelihoods can be used to
learn about models of evolution from biological data. We discuss promising
alternatives that can complement marginal likelihoods for Bayesian model
choice, including posterior-predictive methods. Using simulations, we find one
alternative method based on approximate-Bayesian computation (ABC) to be
biased. We conclude by discussing the challenges of Bayesian model choice and
future directions that promise to improve the approximation of marginal
likelihoods and Bayesian phylogenetics as a whole.

Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology is limited by the threshold voltage
and subthreshold leakage problems in scaling of devices. This leads to failure
in adapting it to sub-micron and nanotechnologies. The carbon nanotube (CNT)
technology overcomes the threshold voltage and subthreshold leakage problems
despite reduction in size. The CNT based technology develops the most promising
devices among emerging technologies because it has most of the desired
features. Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistors (CNFETs) are the novel
devices that are expected to sustain the transistor scalability while
increasing its performance. Recently, there have been tremendous advances in
CNT technology for nanoelectronics applications. CNFETs avoid most of the
fundamental limitations and offer several advantages compared to silicon-based
technology. Though CNT evolves as a better option to overcome some of the bulk
CMOS problems, the CNT itself still immersed with setbacks. The fabrication of
carbon nanotube at very large digital circuits on a single substrate is
difficult to achieve. Therefore, a hybrid NP dynamic Carry Look Ahead Adder
(CLA) is designed using p-CNFET and n-MOS transistors. Here, the performance of
CLA is evaluated in 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit stages with the following
four different implementations: silicon MOSFET (Si-MOSFET) domino logic,
Si-MOSFET NP dynamic CMOS, carbon nanotube MOSFET (CN-MOSFET) domino logic, and

CLA is evaluated based on HSPICE simulation in 32nm technology, which

suggest the uncommon behaviour to be associated with the presence of over- or
under-densities there, but contamination due to residual foregrounds is not
discarded. Additionally, even though our analyses indicate a good agreement
among data and simulations, we identify 1 highly extreme region, seemingly
associated to a large clustered distribution of galaxies. Our results confirm
the usefulness of the MF to analyse GNC maps from photometric galaxy datasets.

evolution and cosmological context of the Local Group. Their most massive stars
are detected by Gaia, and we use Data Release 2 (DR2) to determine the galaxy
proper motions (PMs). We select galaxy members based on, e.g., parallax, PM,
color-magnitude-diagram location, and local stellar density. The PM rotation of
both galaxies is confidently detected, consistent with the known line-of-sight
rotation curves: $V_{\rm rot} = -206\pm86$ km s$^{-1}$ (counter-clockwise) for
M31, and $V_{\rm rot} = 80\pm52$ km s$^{-1}$ (clockwise) for M33. We measure
the center-of-mass PM of each galaxy relative to surrounding background quasars
in DR2. This yields that $({\mu}_{\alpha*},{\mu}_{\delta})$ equals $(65 \pm 18
, -57 \pm 15)$ $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ for M31, and $(31 \pm 19 , -29 \pm 16)$
$\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ for M33. In addition to the listed random errors, each
component has an additional residual systematic error of 16 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$.
These results are consistent at 0.8$\sigma$ and 1.0$\sigma$ with the (2 and 3
times higher-accuracy) measurements already available from Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) optical imaging and VLBA water maser observations,
respectively. This lends confidence that all these measurements are robust. The
new results imply that the M31 orbit towards the Milky Way is somewhat less
radial than previously inferred, $V_{\rm tan, DR2+HST} = 57^{+35}_{-31}$ km
s$^{-1}$, and strengthen arguments that M33 may be on its first infall into
M31. The results highlight the future potential of Gaia for PM studies beyond
the Milky Way satellite system.

sensitive to the average atomic mass, it is challenging to discriminate between
the two lightest elements: proton and helium. In this paper, the
proton-to-helium ratio in the energy range $10^{18.0} \mbox{eV}$ to $10^{19.3}
\mbox{eV}$ is estimated using the tail of the distribution of the depth of the
shower maximum $X_{\mathrm{max}}$. Using the exponential decay scale $\Lambda$

derive the 68\%\,CL constraints on the proton-to-helium ratio

the admixture of heavier elements. We evaluate the impact of the hadronic
interaction model uncertainty. The implications for the astrophysical models of
the origin of cosmic rays and the safety of the future colliders are discussed.

in fully hydrodynamized systems can be built up in collisions that extend over
only one mean free path $l_{\rm mfp}$ and that do not hydrodynamize. This is
qualitatively in line with observing a sizeable $v_2$ in $pp$ collisions for
which other characteristics of soft multi-particle production seem
well-described in a free-streaming picture. We further expose a significant
system size dependence in the accuracy of hybrid approaches that match kinetic
theory to viscous fluid dynamics. The implications of these findings for a
reliable extraction of shear viscosity are discussed.

equations that were recently proposed by Parker [J. Plasma Phys. $\textbf{82}$,
95820602 (2016)] and Ruiz $\textit{et al.}$ [Phys. Plasmas $\textbf{23}$,
122304 (2016)]. Contrary to the traditional geometrical-optics (GO) model of
the drifton dynamics, it is found that driftons can be not only trapped or
passing, but they can also accumulate spatially while experiencing indefinite
growth of their momenta. In particular, it is found that the Rayleigh--Kuo
threshold known from geophysics corresponds to the regime when such ""runaway""
trajectories are the only ones possible. On one hand, this analysis helps
visualize the development of the zonostrophic instability, particularly its
nonlinear stage, which is studied here both analytically and through
wave-kinetic simulations. On the other hand, the GO theory predicts that zonal
flows above the Rayleigh--Kuo threshold can only grow; hence, the deterioration
of intense zonal flows cannot be captured within a GO model. In particular,
this means that the so-called tertiary instability of intense zonal flows
cannot be adequately described within the quasilinear wave kinetic equation,
contrary to some previous studies.

gravitational collapse in the radiation dominated era, we show that the
abundance of primordial blacks holes, generated by an enhancement in the
inflationary power spectrum, is extremely dependent on the shape of the peak.
Given the amplitude of the power spectrum, we show that the density of
primordial black holes generated from a narrow peak, is exponentially smaller
than in the case of a broad peak. Specifically, for a top-hat profile of the
power spectrum in Fourier space, we find that for having primordial black holes
comprising all of the dark matter, one would only need a power spectrum
amplitude an order of magnitude smaller than suggested previously whereas in
the case of a narrow peak, one would instead need a much larger power spectrum
amplitude, which in many cases would invalidate the perturbative analysis of
cosmological perturbations. Finally, we show that, although critical collapse
gives a broad mass spectrum, the density of primordial black holes formed is
dominated by masses roughly equal to the cosmological horizon mass measured at
horizon crossing.

shape from a single color image. This is a task where iterative
optimization-based solutions have typically prevailed, while Convolutional
Networks (ConvNets) have suffered because of the lack of training data and
their low resolution 3D predictions. Our work aims to bridge this gap and
proposes an efficient and effective direct prediction method based on ConvNets.
Central part to our approach is the incorporation of a parametric statistical
body shape model (SMPL) within our end-to-end framework. This allows us to get
very detailed 3D mesh results, while requiring estimation only of a small
number of parameters, making it friendly for direct network prediction.
Interestingly, we demonstrate that these parameters can be predicted reliably
only from 2D keypoints and masks. These are typical outputs of generic 2D human
analysis ConvNets, allowing us to relax the massive requirement that images
with 3D shape ground truth are available for training. Simultaneously, by
maintaining differentiability, at training time we generate the 3D mesh from
the estimated parameters and optimize explicitly for the surface using a 3D
per-vertex loss. Finally, a differentiable renderer is employed to project the
3D mesh to the image, which enables further refinement of the network, by
optimizing for the consistency of the projection with 2D annotations (i.e., 2D
keypoints or masks). The proposed approach outperforms previous baselines on
this task and offers an attractive solution for direct prediction of 3D shape
from a single color image.

F{0.3-8keV} = 1.1 x 10^-14 erg/s/cm^2, and confirm that the X-ray light curve
is now also fading. Through rigorous comparisons to previous Chandra
observations of GW170817/GRB170817A, X-ray fading is detected between 160 and

alone. We further constrain the X-ray photon index to steepen by <0.5 at 3.1
sigma significance during this period, which disfavors the passing of the
synchrotron cooling frequency through the X-ray band as the cause of the
observed fading. These observations remain consistent with optically thin
synchrotron afterglow emission. If this afterglow emission arises from a
quasi-spherical mildly relativistic outflow, the X-ray fading suggests that the
outflow is now decelerating. Alternatively, if this afterglow arises from a
successful off-axis structured jet, the X-ray fading suggests that emission
from the jet core has already entered the line of sight.

limit of potential substellar companions with the radial velocity method. Our
goal is to determine stellar parameters, including mass, radius, age, surface
gravity, effective temperature and luminosity, for the sample of giants
observed by the Lick planet search. Furthermore, we want to derive the
probability of these stars being on the horizontal branch (HB) or red giant

astrometric observables to grids of stellar evolutionary models using Bayesian
inference. We provide tables of stellar parameters, probabilities for the
current post-main sequence evolutionary stage, and probability density
functions for 372 giants from the Lick planet search. We find that $81\%$ of
the stars in our sample are more probably on the HB. In particular, this is the
case for 15 of the 16 planet host stars in the sample. We tested the
reliability of our methodology by comparing our stellar parameters to
literature values and find very good agreement. Furthermore, we created a small
test sample of 26 giants with available asteroseismic masses and evolutionary
stages and compared these to our estimates. The mean difference of the stellar
masses for the 24 stars with the same evolutionary stages by both methods is
only $\langle\Delta M\rangle=0.01\pm0.20\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$. We do not find any
evidence for large systematic differences between our results and estimates of
stellar parameters based on other methods. In particular we find no significant
systematic offset between stellar masses provided by asteroseismology to our
Bayesian estimates based on evolutionary models.

the effectiveness and flexibility of training Convolutional Networks (ConvNets)

message from a set of databases without revealing the identity of the desired
message. The replicated databases scenario was considered by Sun and Jafar,
2016, where $N$ databases can store the same $K$ messages completely. A PIR
scheme was developed to achieve the optimal download cost given by $\left(1+
\frac{1}{N}+ \frac{1}{N^{2}}+ \cdots + \frac{1}{N^{K-1}}\right)$. In this work,
we consider the problem of PIR from storage constrained databases. Each
database has a storage capacity of $\mu KL$ bits, where $L$ is the size of each
message in bits, and $\mu \in [1/N, 1]$ is the normalized storage. On one
extreme, $\mu=1$ is the replicated databases case. On the other hand, when
$\mu= 1/N$, then in order to retrieve a message privately, the user has to
download all the messages from the databases achieving a download cost of
$1/K$. We aim to characterize the optimal download cost versus storage
trade-off for any storage capacity in the range $\mu \in [1/N, 1]$. For any
$(N,K)$, we show that the optimal trade-off between storage, $\mu$, and the
download cost, $D(\mu)$, is given by the lower convex hull of the $N$ pairs
$\left(\mu= \frac{t}{N},D(\mu) = \left(1+ \frac{1}{t}+ \frac{1}{t^{2}}+ \cdots
+ \frac{1}{t^{K-1}}\right)\right)$ for $t=1,2,\ldots, N$. To prove this result,
we first present the storage constrained PIR scheme for any $(N,K)$. We next
obtain a general lower bound on the download cost for PIR, which is valid for
the following storage scenarios: replicated or storage constrained, coded or
uncoded, and fixed or optimized. We then specialize this bound using the
uncoded storage assumption to obtain lower bounds matching the achievable
download cost of the storage constrained PIR scheme for any value of the
available storage.

by a Maxwell construction a low-density phase of hadronic matter, modeled by a
relativistic meanfield approach with excluded nucleon volume, with a
high-density phase of color superconducting two-flavor quark matter, described
within a nonlocal covariant chiral quark model. We find the conditions on the
vector meson coupling in the quark model under which a stable branch of hybrid
compact stars occurs in the cases with and without diquark condensation. We
show that these hybrid stars do not form a third family disconnected from the
second family of ordinary neutron stars unless additional (de)confining effects
are introduced with a density-dependent bag pressure. A suitably chosen density
dependence of the vector meson coupling assures that at the same time the
$2~$M$_\odot$ maximum mass constraint is fulfilled on the hybrid star branch. A
twofold interpolation method is realized which implements both, the density
dependence of a confining bag pressure at the onset of the hadron-to-quark
matter transition as well as the stiffening of quark matter at higher densities
by a density-dependent vector meson coupling. For three parametrizations of
this class of hybrid equation of state the properties of corresponding compact
star sequences are presented, including mass twins of neutron and hybrid stars
at 2.00, 1.39 and 1.20 $M_\odot$, respectively. The sensitivity of the hybrid
equation of state and the corresponding compact star sequences to variations of
the interpolation parameters at the 10% level is investigated and it is found
that the feature of third family solutions for compact stars is robust against
such a variation. This advanced description of hybrid star matter allows to
interpret GW170817 as a merger not only of two neutron stars but also of a
neutron star with a hybrid star or of two hybrid stars.

of critical importance to the next generation of galaxy cluster surveys.
However, most models of structure formation neglect potentially important
physical processes, like anisotropic thermal conduction (ATC). In this letter,
we explore the impact of ATC on the prevalence of cool-cores (CCs) using 12
pairs of magnetohydrodynamical galaxy cluster simulations, simulated using the
IllustrisTNG model with and without ATC. Although the impact of ATC varies from
cluster to cluster and with CC criterion, its inclusion produces a systematic
shift to larger CC fractions at z = 0 for all CC criteria considered.
Additionally, the inclusion of ATC yields a flatter CC fraction redshift
evolution, easing the tension with the observed evolution. With ATC included,
the energy required for the central black hole to achieve self-regulation is
reduced and the gas fraction in the cluster core increases, resulting in larger
CC fractions. ATC makes the ICM unstable to perturbations and the increased
efficiency of AGN feedback suggests that its inclusion results in a greater
level of mixing in the ICM. Therefore, ATC is potentially an important physical
process in reproducing the thermal structure of the ICM.

along the red giant branch (RGB) is sensitive to a number of parameters
including the overall metallicity, elemental abundance patterns, the efficiency
of convection, and the treatment of the surface boundary condition. Recently
there has been interest in using observational estimates of the RGB Teff to
place constraints on the mixing length parameter, a_MLT, and possible variation
with metallicity. Here we use 1D MESA stellar evolution models to explore the
sensitivity of the RGB Teff to the treatment of the surface boundary condition.
We find that different surface boundary conditions can lead to +/- 100 K
metallicity-dependent offsets on the RGB relative to one another in spite of
the fact that all models can reproduce the properties of the Sun. Moreover, for
a given atmosphere T-tau relation, we find that the RGB Teff is also sensitive
to the optical depth at which the surface boundary condition is applied in the
stellar model. Nearly all models adopt the photosphere as the location of the
surface boundary condition but this choice is somewhat arbitrary. We compare
our models to stellar parameters derived from the APOGEE-Kepler sample of first
ascent red giants and find that systematic uncertainties in the models due to
treatment of the surface boundary condition place a limit of ~100 K below which
it is not possible to make firm conclusions regarding the fidelity of the

km s$^{-1}$. The rotation axis of the GC system has a position angle of about
161$^{\circ}$, which is 51$\rlap{.}{^\circ}$5 larger than that of the stellar

estimated to be $\sigma_{\rm r,cor} = $ 160 km s$^{-1}$. The rotation parameter
$\Omega R_{\rm icor}/\sigma_{\rm r,cor}$ of the GC system is derived to be
1.47$^{+1.05}_{-0.48}$, which is one of the largest among known early-type
galaxies. The ages and metallicities of the GCs, which show the same trend as

the mean age is $\sim$ 3.7 $\pm$ 1.9 Gyr, having a mean [Fe/H] value of --0.26.

noise is modelled as a Gaussian distribution, about $60\%$ high peaks

re-classified from planets to non-planets. A critical review of the literature
from the 19th Century to the present shows this is factually incorrect. The
literature shows the term asteroid was broadly recognized as a subset of planet
for 150 years. On-going discovery of asteroids resulted in a de facto
stretching of the concept of planet to include the ever-smaller bodies.
Scientists found utility in this taxonomic identification as it provided
categories needed to argue for the leading hypothesis of planet formation,
Laplace's nebular hypothesis. In the 1950s, developments in planet formation
theory found it no longer useful to maintain taxonomic identification between
asteroids and planets, Ceres being the primary exception. At approximately the
same time, there was a flood of publications on the geophysical nature of
asteroids showing them to be geophysically different than the large planets.
This is when the terminology in asteroid publications calling them planets
abruptly plunged from a high level of usage where it had hovered during the
period 1801 - 1957 to a low level that held constant thereafter. This marks the
point where the community effectively formed consensus that asteroids should be
taxonomically distinct from planets. The evidence demonstrates this consensus
formed on the basis of geophysical differences between asteroids and planets,
not the sharing of orbits. We suggest attempts to build consensus around
planetary taxonomy not rely on the non-scientific process of voting, but rather
through precedent set in scientific literature and discourse, by which
perspectives evolve with additional observations and information, just as they
did in the case of asteroids.

color-excess and uncrowded location mitigated uncertainties tied to the
extinction law, the magnitude-limited nature of the analysis, and photometric
contamination. Circumventing those problems resulted in a key uncertainty being

of the planet's surface and/or atmosphere, as well as potentially constraining
the mass via gravitational influences on the host star. Recently, Jansen &
Kipping (2018) demonstrated that exoplanets with precisely constrained orbital
periods, as is typical of transiting planets, enable one to exploit a
Fourier-argument to non-parametrically separate optical phase curves from
long-term photometric time series in the presence of realistic noise
structures. This algorithm, dubbed phasma, was applied to 477 confirmed
exoplanets in the original paper. In this research note, we extend the sample
to all non-false positive Kepler Objects of Interest with periods less than ten
days. Our sample of 1998 detrended phase curves are made publicly available to
help the community search for various effects. A Python port of the phasma code
is also made available.

their effective drag. From the distribution of currents, we compute the

Therefore, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory

diffusion coefficients for 14 substitutional alloying elements in hexagonal
closed packed (HCP) Zr. Vacancy-mediated diffusion was modeled with the
eight-frequency model. Interstitial contributions to diffusion are estimated
from interstitial formation and select migration energies. Formation energies
for each impurity in nine high-symmetry interstitial sites were determined,
including significant effects of thermal expansion. The dominant diffusion
mechanism of each solute in HCP Zr was identified in terms of the calculated
vacancy-mediated activation energy, lower and upper bounds of interstitial
activation energy, and the formation entropy, suggesting a rough relation with
the metallic radii of solutes. It is predicted that Cr, Cu, V, Zn, Mo, W, Au,
Ag, Al, Nb, Ta and Ti all diffuse predominantly by an interstitial mechanism,

dealing with larger $s$-$t$ cuts, even though they are much less structured.

with larger size cuts, by exploiting a seminal result of Karger on the number
of near-minimum cuts. This avoids a recursive application of dynamic
programming as used by Traub and Vygen, and leads to a considerably simpler
algorithm avoiding an additional error term in the approximation guarantee. We
match the still unbeaten $1.5$-approximation guarantee of Christofides'
algorithm for TSP. Hence, any further progress on the approximability of Path
TSP will also lead to an improvement for TSP.

methods attempt to improve accuracy with sophisticated network design, while
paying less attention on speed. In this paper, we propose a general framework
for text detection called Guided CNN to achieve the two goals simultaneously.
The proposed model consists of one guidance subnetwork, where a guidance mask
is learned from the input image itself, and one primary text detector, where
every convolution and non-linear operation are conducted only in the guidance
mask. On the one hand, the guidance subnetwork filters out non-text regions
coarsely, greatly reduces the computation complexity. On the other hand, the
primary text detector focuses on distinguishing between text and hard non-text
regions and regressing text bounding boxes, achieves a better detection
accuracy. A training strategy, called background-aware block-wise random
synthesis, is proposed to further boost up the performance. We demonstrate that
the proposed Guided CNN is not only effective but also efficient with two
state-of-the-art methods, CTPN and EAST, as backbones. On the challenging
benchmark ICDAR 2013, it speeds up CTPN by 2.9 times on average, while
improving the F-measure by 1.5%. On ICDAR 2015, it speeds up EAST by 2.0 times

used to derive a quantum field theory with good properties for the matter

inhomogeneous perturbations at lowest nontrivial order, and focus our attention
on the contribution of minimally coupled fermionic perturbations of Dirac type.
Within the framework of the hybrid quantization, we analyze the different
possible separations of the homogeneous background and the inhomogeneous
perturbations, by means of canonical transformations that mix the two separated
sectors. These possibilities provide a family of sets of annihilation and
creationlike fermionic variables, each of them with a different associated
contribution to the total Hamiltonian. In all cases, imposing the quantum
constraints and introducing a Born-Oppenheimer approximation, one can derive a
Schr\""odinger equation for the fermionic part of the wave functions. The
resulting evolution turns out to be generated, for each of the allowed choices
of variables, by a version of the fermionic contribution to the Hamiltonian
which is obtained by evaluating all the dependence on the homogeneous geometry
at quantum expectation values. This equation contains a term that encodes the
backreaction of the fermionic perturbations on the quantum dynamics of the
homogeneous sector. We analyze this backreaction by solving the associated
Heisenberg evolution of the fermionic annihilation and creation operators.
Then, we identify the conditions that the choice of those operators must
satisfy in order to lead to a finite backreaction. Finally, we discuss further
restrictions on this choice so that the fermionic Hamiltonian that dictates the
Schr\""odinger dynamics is densely defined in Fock space.

exists a coordinate where all these codewords have distinct values.
Understanding the largest possible rate (in bits), defined as $(\log_2 |C|)/n$,
of a $k$-hash code is a classical problem. It arises in two equivalent
contexts: (i) the smallest size possible for a perfect hash family that maps a
universe of $N$ elements into $\{1,2,\dots,k\}$, and (ii) the zero-error
capacity for decoding with lists of size less than $k$ for a certain
combinatorial channel.
  A general upper bound of $k!/k^{k-1}$ on the rate of a $k$-hash code (in the
limit of large $n$) was obtained by Fredman and Koml\'{o}s in 1984 for any $k
\geq 4$. While better bounds have been obtained for $k=4$, their original bound
has remained the best known for each $k \ge 5$. In this work, we obtain the

get explicit (numerical) bounds for $k=5,6$, for larger $k$ we only show that
the FK bound can be improved by a positive, but unspecified, amount. Under a

broad class of the problems including perfect plasticity or plasticity with

displacements, discretized by the implicit Euler method in time and the finite
element method in space, and solved by the semismooth Newton method. We discuss
in detail selected models with the von Mises and Prager-Drucker yield criteria

stiffness matrices. Since these matrices are repeatedly constructed in each
Newton iteration and in each time step, we propose another vectorized
assembling than current ones known for the elastic stiffness matrices. The main
idea is based on a construction of two large and sparse matrices representing
the strain-displacement and tangent operators, respectively, where the former
matrix remains fixed and the latter one is updated only at some integration
points. Comparisons with other available MATLAB codes show that our technique
is also efficient for purely elastic problems. In elastoplasticity, the
assembly times are linearly proportional to the number of integration points in
a plastic phase and additional times due to plasticity never exceed assembly
time of the elastic stiffness matrix.

causation. Despite its fundamental role in science, engineering and
biomedicine, the traditional methods for causal inference require at least
three variables. However, quantitative genetic analysis such as QTL, eQTL,
mQTL, and genomic-imaging data analysis requires exploring the causal
relationships between two variables. This paper will focus on bivariate causal
discovery. We will introduce independence of cause and mechanism (ICM) as a
basic principle for causal inference, algorithmic information theory and
additive noise model (ANM) as major tools for bivariate causal discovery.
Large-scale simulations will be performed to evaluate the feasibility of the
ANM for bivariate causal discovery. To further evaluate their performance for
causal inference, the ANM will be applied to the construction of gene
regulatory networks. Also, the ANM will be applied to trait-imaging data
analysis to illustrate three scenarios: presence of both causation and
association, presence of association while absence of causation, and presence
of causation, while lack of association between two variables.

protocol if noise is introduced with a multiplicative cost of
$\mathrm{poly}(\log \Delta, \log \log n)$ rounds where $n$ is the number nodes

even if the simulated protocol is not non-adaptive, it can be simulated with a
multiplicative $O(\Delta \log ^2 \Delta)$ cost in the number of rounds. Lastly,
we argue that simulations with a multiplicative overhead of $o(\log \Delta)$

round overhead is necessary under certain natural assumptions.

Conventional adiabatic protocols, as coherent transfer by adiabatic passage

how by implementing the modified pulses, fast adiabatic-like charge transport
between the outer dots can be eventually achieved without populating
intermediate dots. We discuss as well the dependence of the transfer fidelity
on the operation time in the presence of dephasing. The proposed protocols for
accelerating adiabatic charge transfer directly between the outer dots in a QD

minimizing decoherence and relaxation processes.

disentangling the heterogeneous parameters from the shocks, which contaminates
the estimates of the heterogeneous parameters. To tackle this problem, I assume
that there is an underlying distribution of heterogeneous parameters, model
this distribution nonparametrically allowing for correlation between
heterogeneous parameters and initial conditions as well as individual-specific
regressors, and then estimate this distribution by combining information from
the whole panel. Theoretically, I prove that in cross-sectional homoskedastic
cases, both the estimated common parameters and the estimated distribution of
the heterogeneous parameters achieve posterior consistency, and that the
density forecasts asymptotically converge to the oracle forecast.
Methodologically, I develop a simulation-based posterior sampling algorithm
specifically addressing the nonparametric density estimation of unobserved

tight-binding model of BaFe$_2$As$_2$ that includes the As-$p$ orbital degrees
of freedom in addition to the Fe-$d$ orbitals and compared to calculations for
a 10-orbital Fe-$d$ only model. In both models we find a leading $s^\pm$

compound. Upon doping, we find that the $s^\pm$ state remains the leading state
in the 16-orbital model up to a doping level of 0.475 electrons per unit cell,
at which the hole Fermi surface pockets at the zone center start to disappear.
This is in contrast to the 10-orbital model, where the $d$-wave state becomes
the leading state at a doping of less than 0.2 electrons. This improved
stability of $s^\pm$ pairing is found to arise from a decrease of $d_{xy}$
orbital weight on the electron pockets due to hybridization with the As-$p$
orbitals and the resulting reduction of near $(\pi,\pi)$ spin-fluctuation
scattering which favors the competing $d$-wave state. These results show that
the orbital dependent hybridization of Fermi surface Bloch states with the
usually neglected $p$-orbital states is an important ingredient in an improved
itinerant pairing theory.

in the B-type stars. Halo stars dominate the sample at speeds about 100 km/s

speeds about 100 km/s above Galactic escape velocity originate from the
Galactic center. Two bound stars may also originate from the Galactic center.
Future Gaia measurements will enable a large, clean sample of Galactic center

sequence-to-sequence modeling also lead to performance improvements. While the
new models completely depart from the original recurrent architecture, we
decided to investigate how to make RNNs more efficient. In this work, we
propose a new recurrent NMT architecture, called Simple Recurrent NMT, built on
a class of fast and weakly-recurrent units that use layer normalization and

unsupervised clustering-based (UC-based) solar forecasting methodology is
developed for short-term (1-hour-ahead) global horizontal irradiance (GHI)
forecasting. This methodology consists of three parts: GHI time series
unsupervised clustering, pattern recognition, and UC-based forecasting. The
daily GHI time series is first clustered by an Optimized Cross-validated
ClUsteRing (OCCUR) method, which determines the optimal number of clusters and
best clustering results. Then, support vector machine pattern recognition
(SVM-PR) is adopted to recognize the category of a certain day using the first
few hours' data in the forecasting stage. GHI forecasts are generated by the
most suitable models in different clusters, which are built by a two-layer
Machine learning based Multi-Model (M3) forecasting framework. The developed
UC-based methodology is validated by using 1-year of data with six solar
features. Numerical results show that (i) UC-based models outperform non-UC

M3-based models also outperform the single-algorithm machine learning (SAML)

present a tactile-sensing based approach to this challenging problem of
grasping novel objects without prior knowledge of their location or physical
properties. Our key idea is to combine touch based object localization with
tactile based re-grasping. To train our learning models, we created a
large-scale grasping dataset, including more than 30 RGB frames and over 2.8
million tactile samples from 7800 grasp interactions of 52 objects. To learn a
representation of tactile signals, we propose an unsupervised auto-encoding
scheme, which shows a significant improvement of 4-9% over prior methods on a
variety of tactile perception tasks. Our system consists of two steps. First,
our touch localization model sequentially 'touch-scans' the workspace and uses
a particle filter to aggregate beliefs from multiple hits of the target. It
outputs an estimate of the object's location, from which an initial grasp is
established. Next, our re-grasping model learns to progressively improve grasps
with tactile feedback based on the learned features. This network learns to
estimate grasp stability and predict adjustment for the next grasp. Re-grasping
thus is performed iteratively until our model identifies a stable grasp.
Finally, we demonstrate extensive experimental results on grasping a large set
of novel objects using tactile sensing alone. Furthermore, when applied on top
of a vision-based policy, our re-grasping model significantly boosts the
overall accuracy by 10.6%. We believe this is the first attempt at learning to
grasp with only tactile sensing and without any prior object knowledge.

As compared to other Landau levels, the zeroth chiral Landau level exhibits a
distinct linear dispersion in z momentum direction and allows the optical
transitions without the limitation of zero z momentum or square root of
magnetic field evolution. The magnetic field dependence of the zeroth Landau
levels further verifies the predicted particle-hole asymmetry of the Weyl
cones. Meanwhile, the optical transitions from the normal Landau levels exhibit
the coexistence of multiple carriers including an unexpected massive Dirac
fermion, pointing to a more complex topological nature in
inversion-symmetry-breaking Weyl semimetals. Our results provide insights into
the Landau quantization of Weyl fermions and demonstrate an effective tool for
studying complex topological systems.

from the Floquet-Bloch band structure of the clean system at high symmetry

structure of the clean system in such a way that the smallest gap in the
Brillouin zone can be shifted from the $M$ points to the $K(K')$ points, the
$\Gamma$ point, or even other lower symmetry points. The movement of the
minimal gap point through the Brillouin zone as a function of laser parameters
is explained in the high frequency regime through the Magnus expansion. In the
disordered model, we compute the Bott index to reveal topological phases and
transitions. The disorder can induce transitions from topologically non-trivial
states to trivial states or vice versa, both examples of Floquet topological
Anderson transitions. As a result of the movement of the minimal gap point

linearization schemes incorporating the fixed-stress splitting scheme, coupled
with an L-scheme, Modified Picard and Newton linearization of the flow. All
schemes allow the efficient and robust decoupling of mechanics and flow
equations. In particular, the simplest scheme, the Fixed-Stress-L-scheme,
employs solely constant diagonal stabilization, has low cost per iteration, and
is very robust. Under mild, physical assumptions, it is theoretically shown to
be a contraction. Due to possible break-down or slow convergence of all
considered splitting schemes, Anderson acceleration is applied as
post-processing. Based on a special case, we justify theoretically the general
ability of the Anderson acceleration to effectively accelerate convergence and
stabilize the underlying scheme, allowing even non-contractive fixed-point
iterations to converge. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical
indication of this kind. Theoretical findings are confirmed by numerical
results. In particular, Anderson acceleration has been demonstrated to be very

spherical nanoparticles binding to lipid-bilayer membrane vesicles results in a
remarkably rich set of morphologies that can be controlled quantitatively via
the particle binding energy. We find that when the binding energy is weak
relative to a characteristic membrane-bending energy, the vesicles adhere to
one another and form a soft solid, which could be used as a useful platform for
controlled release. When the binding energy is larger, the vesicles undergo a
remarkable destruction process consisting first of invaginated tubules,
followed by vesicles turning inside-out, yielding a network of
nanoparticle-membrane tubules. We propose that the crossover from one behavior
to the other is triggered by the transition from partial to complete wrapping
of nanoparticles. This model is confirmed by computer simulations and by
quantitative estimates of the binding energy. These findings open the door to a
new class of vesicle-based, closed-cell gels that are more than 99% water and

permutation structures. Towards this problem, we present a construction that we
conjecture produces all such structures. Some evidence for this conjecture is
given, including the classification of the homogeneous 3-dimensional
permutation structures.
  We next consider the topological dynamics, in the style of Kechris, Pestov,

finite-dimensional permutation structures we have constructed, which requires
proving a structural Ramsey theorem for all the associated amalgamation

permutation avoidance class is atomic, or equivalently, has the joint embedding
property. As a first approximation to this problem, we prove the undecidability
of the corresponding decision problem in the category of graphs. Modifying this
proof also gives the undecidability, in the category of graphs, of the
corresponding decision problem for the joint homomorphism property, which is of

mechanical and electronic properties of the single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs). However, some discrepancies emerge in recent studies of the
fullerence encapsulation effect on the thermal conductivity of SWCNTs. More
specifically, most previous theoretical works predicted slightly enhancement of
the thermal conductivity, but the recent experiment by Kodama et al. (Nat. Mat.
16, 892 (2017)) observed clear reduction of the thermal conductivity in SWCNTs
by fullerence encapsulation. We perform molecular dynamics simulations to
revisit this issue, by comparatively investigate the thermal conductivity of
the SWCNT (n, n) and the corresponding peapod (n, n) with n = 8, 9, 10, and 11.
We find that the fullerence encapsulation can reduce the thermal conductivity
of narrower SWCNTs with n = 8 and 9, but it can slightly enhance the thermal
conductivity of thicker SWCNTs with n = 10 and 11. The underlying mechanisms
for these opposite effects are explored by analyzing the encapsulation induced
structural deformation and the variation of the phonon dispersion of the SWCNT.
We illustrate that the reduction effect observed in the recent experiment is
related to the mechanism for reduction of the thermal conductivity for narrower
SWCNTs here, while previous numerical works correspond to the enhancement
effect for thicker SWCNTs found in the present work. Our findings shed lights
on clarifying the discrepancy between previous numerical predictions and
experimental observations on the effect of the fullerence encapsulation on the
thermal conductivity of the SWCNT.

framework which uses tree ensembles as its building blocks and it has achieved
highly competitive results on various domains of tasks. However, it has not
been tested on extremely large scale tasks. In this work, based on our

To meet the need for real-world tasks, many improvements are introduced to the
original deep forest model, including MART (Multiple Additive Regression Tree)
as base learners for efficiency and effectiveness consideration, the cost-based
method for handling prevalent class-imbalanced data, MART based feature
selection for high dimension data and different evaluation metrics for
automatically determining of the cascade level. We tested the deep forest model
on an extra-large scale task, i.e., automatic detection of cash-out fraud, with
more than 100 millions of training samples. Experimental results showed that
the deep forest model has the best performance according to the evaluation
metrics from different perspectives even with very little effort for parameter
tuning. This model can block fraud transactions in a large amount of money each

additionally bring into a significant decrease in economic loss each day.

the combination of s- and r-process abundances. In this work, adopting the
abundance decomposition method, we investigate the astrophysical origins of the
elements in this star. We find that the primary process of massive stars
dominates the production of the light elements and iron-group elements. The
lighter neutron-capture elements from Ge to Te mainly come from the weak
r-process. The elements from Ba to Pb are synthesized dominantly by the main s-

94028 are mainly produced by the weak r-process, which possesses the features
of the supersolar ratio [As/Ge] and subsolar ratio [Se/As]. Because Ge is not

using a single-view depth prediction network as a virtual depth sensor. We
adopt a fairly standard approach to data fusion, to produce a fused depth map

confidence weights. Crucially, we obtain the confidence weights that
parameterize the CRF model in a data-dependent manner via Convolutional Neural

distributions given each source of input depth map and the associated RGB

scale-invariant depth error in its edges, and the confidence-based fusion
minimizes the impact of outlier input depth values on the fused result. We
demonstrate the flexibility of our method by real-time inpainting of ORB-SLAM,

has been recognized as a promising approach to it. Given a graph describing the
relationship between data, spectral clustering explores the underlying cluster
structure in two stages. The first stage embeds the nodes of the graph in real
space, and the second stage groups the embedded nodes into several clusters.
The use of the $k$-means method in the grouping stage is currently standard
practice. We present a spectral clustering algorithm that uses convex
programming in the grouping stage and study how well it works. This algorithm
is designed based on the following observation. If a graph is well-clustered,
then the nodes with the largest degree in each cluster can be found by
computing an enclosing ellipsoid of the nodes embedded in real space, and the
clusters can be identified by using those nodes. We show that, for
well-clustered graphs, the algorithm can find clusters of nodes with minimal
conductance. We also give an experimental assessment of the algorithm's
performance.

employs machine learning to develop a predictive model to quickly select a

shown that the competition between the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)
interaction and the Kondo effect governs the amplitude of $\langle
\vec{S}_1\vec{S}_2 \rangle$. For distances $R$ exceeding the Kondo length
scale, the Kondo effect also has a profound effect on the sign of the
correlation function. For ferromagnetic Heisenberg couplings $J$ between the
impurities and the conduction band, the Kondo effect is absent and the
correlation function only decays for distances beyond a certain length scale
introduced by finite temperature. The real-time dynamics after a sudden quench
of the system reveals that correlations propagate through the conduction band
with Fermi velocity. We identify two distinct timescales for the long time
behavior which reflects that for small $J$ the system is driven by the RKKY
interaction while for large $J$ the Kondo effect dominates. Interestingly, we
find that at certain distances a one-dimensional dispersion obeying
$\epsilon(k)=\epsilon(-k)$ may lead to a local parity conservation of the
impurities such that $\langle \vec{S}_1\vec{S}_2 \rangle$ becomes a conserved
quantity for long times and does not decay to its equilibrium value.

equation in a doubly periodic box with a linear drag and a finite flow rate in
the direction in which Galilean invariance is broken. We examine the mechanism
of DP class transition focusing on the role of the additional control
parameters: the drag coefficient and the flow rate. The drag kills coherent
active structures of the system size. The flow rate interferes the growth of

it calls for real-time data processing with the absence of a retraining process
and/or an iterative learning approach. In realm of fuzzy system community, data
stream is handled by algorithmic development of self-adaptive neurofuzzy
systems (SANFS) characterized by the single-pass learning mode and the open
structure property which enables effective handling of fast and rapidly
changing natures of data streams. The underlying bottleneck of SANFSs lies in
its design principle which involves a high number of free parameters (rule
premise and rule consequent) to be adapted in the training process. This figure
can even double in the case of type-2 fuzzy system. In this work, a novel
SANFS, namely parsimonious learning machine (PALM), is proposed. PALM features
utilization of a new type of fuzzy rule based on the concept of hyperplane
clustering which significantly reduces the number of network parameters because
it has no rule premise parameters. PALM is proposed in both type-1 and type-2
fuzzy systems where all of which characterize a fully dynamic rule-based
system. That is, it is capable of automatically generating, merging and tuning
the hyperplane-based fuzzy rule in the single pass manner. Moreover, an
extension of PALM, namely recurrent PALM (rPALM), is proposed and adopts the
concept of teacher-forcing mechanism in the deep learning literature. The
efficacy of PALM has been evaluated through numerical study with six real-world

in terms of computational complexity and number of required parameters against
several renowned SANFSs, while attaining comparable and often better predictive

coupling a ferroelectric to the capacitor dielectric. Maxwell's equations are
solved for the coupled system to analyze energy flow from the perspective of
Poynting's theorem and show that (1) total energy dissipation is reduced below
the fundamental limit during charging and discharging; (2) energy is saved by
""recycling"" the energy already stored in the ferroelectric phase transition;
and (3) this phase transition energy is directly transferred between the

about the semantics of replicated datatypes that provide eventual consistency
in a distributed system, and for mechanically verifying algorithms that
implement these datatypes. Our approach is simple but expressive, allowing us
to succinctly specify a variety of abstract datatypes, including maps, sets,
lists, text, graphs, trees, and registers. Our datatypes are also composable,
enabling the construction of complex data structures. To demonstrate the
utility of OpSets for analysing replication algorithms, we highlight an
important correctness property for collaborative text editing that has
traditionally been overlooked; algorithms that do not satisfy this property can
exhibit awkward interleaving of text. We use OpSets to specify this correctness
property and prove that although one existing replication algorithm satisfies
this property, several other published algorithms do not. We also show how
OpSets can be used to develop new replicated datatypes: we provide a simple
specification of an atomic move operation for trees, an operation that had
previously been thought to be impossible to implement without locking. We use
the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant to formalise the OpSets approach and produce
mechanised proofs of correctness of the main claims in this paper, thereby
eliminating the ambiguity of previous informal approaches, and ruling out
reasoning errors that could occur in handwritten proofs.

are served by several types of servers subject to a bipartite compatibility
graph, and the service policy is first come first served. Two of the models
have a fixed set of servers. The first is a queueing model in which arriving
customers are assigned to the longest idling compatible server if available, or
else queue up in a single queue, and servers that become available pick the
longest waiting compatible customer, as studied by Adan and Weiss, 2014. The
second is a redundancy service model where arriving customers split into copies
that queue up at all the compatible servers, and are served in each queue on
FCFS basis, and leave the system when the first copy completes service, as
studied by Gardner et al., 2016. The third model is a matching queueing model
with a random stream of arriving servers. Arriving customers queue in a single
queue and arriving servers match with the first compatible customer and leave
immediately with the customer, or they leave without a customer. The last model
is relevant to organ transplants, to housing assignments, to adoptions and many
other situations.
  We study the relations between these models, and show that they are closely
related to the FCFS infinite bipartite matching model, in which two infinite
sequences of customers and servers of several types are matched FCFS according

introduce a directed bipartite matching model in which we embed the queueing
systems. This leads to a generalization of Burke's theorem to parallel service

time $\tau$ scaled as $\tau =aL^z$, $L$ being the system length and $z$ the
dynamic critical exponent (which takes the value $z=1$ in the bilayer model

the correct location and universality class with increasing $L$, independently

$a$ and the initial state only changes the cross-over behavior into the
asymptotic large-$L$ behavior. In some cases, choosing an optimal factor $a$
may also lead to the vanishing of the leading finite-size corrections. The
observation of typicality can be used to speed up simulations of quantum
criticality, not only within the Monte Carlo approach but also with other
numerical methods where imaginary-time evolution is employed, e.g., tensor
network states, as it is not necessary to evolve fully to the ground state but
only for sufficiently long times to reach the typicality regime.

key limitations. First, it ignores Program Aliasing: the fact that many
different programs may satisfy a given specification (especially with
incomplete specifications such as a few input-output examples). By maximizing
the likelihood of only a single reference program, it penalizes many
semantically correct programs, which can adversely affect the synthesizer
performance. Second, this strategy overlooks the fact that programs have a
strict syntax that can be efficiently checked. To address the first limitation,
we perform reinforcement learning on top of a supervised model with an
objective that explicitly maximizes the likelihood of generating semantically
correct programs. For addressing the second limitation, we introduce a training
procedure that directly maximizes the probability of generating syntactically
correct programs that fulfill the specification. We show that our contributions

the issue of scalability as the number of devices may grow much quicker than
vendors' distribution systems. Previous studies have suggested a permissionless

security updates, thus the addition of new nodes scales out the network.
However, these studies do not provide an incentive for nodes to join the
network, making it unlikely for nodes to freely contribute their hosting space,
bandwidth, and computation resources. In this paper, we propose a novel
decentralized IoT software update delivery network in which participating nodes
referred to as distributors) are compensated by vendors with digital currency
for delivering updates to devices. Upon the release of a new security update, a
vendor will make a commitment to provide digital currency to distributors that
deliver the update; the commitment will be made with the use of smart
contracts, and hence will be public, binding, and irreversible. The smart
contract promises compensation to any distributor that provides
proof-of-distribution, which is unforgeable proof that a single update was
delivered to a single device. A distributor acquires the proof-of-distribution
by exchanging a security update for a device signature using the Zero-Knowledge
Contingent Payment (ZKCP) trustless data exchange protocol. Eliminating the
need for trust between the security update distributor and the security
consumer (IoT device) by providing fair compensation, can significantly
increase the number of distributors, thus facilitating rapid scale out.

parsec-scale flows is related to the fraction of X-ray photons in quasar
radiation. For the models in which the fraction of X-ray photons is not small
(e.g. the X-ray photons contribute to $20\%$ of the quasar radiation), the
nuclear stars gravity is very helpful to collimate the outflows driven by UV
photons, significantly weakens the outflow power at the outer boundary and
significantly enhances the net accretion rate onto the black hole. For the
models in which X-ray photons are significantly decreased (e.g. the X-ray
photons contribute to $5\%$ of the quasar radiation), the nuclear stars gravity
can just slightly change properties of outflow and slightly enhance the net
accretion rate onto the black hole.

supervision, \emph{e.g.}, few exemplary images for a species of bird, yet our
best deep learning systems need hundreds or thousands of labeled examples. In
this paper, we try to reduce this gap by studying the fine-grained image
recognition problem in a challenging few-shot learning setting, termed few-shot
fine-grained recognition (FSFG). The task of FSFG requires the learning systems
to build classifiers for novel fine-grained categories from few examples (only
one or less than five). To solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end
trainable deep network which is inspired by the state-of-the-art fine-grained
recognition model and is tailored for the FSFG task.
  Specifically, our network consists of a bilinear feature learning module and
a classifier mapping module: while the former encodes the discriminative
information of an exemplar image into a feature vector, the latter maps the
intermediate feature into the decision boundary of the novel category. The key
novelty of our model is a ""piecewise mappings"" function in the classifier
mapping module, which generates the decision boundary via learning a set of
more attainable sub-classifiers in a more parameter-economic way. We learn the
exemplar-to-classifier mapping based on an auxiliary dataset in a meta-learning
fashion, which is expected to be able to generalize to novel categories. By
conducting comprehensive experiments on three fine-grained datasets, we
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over the
competing baselines.

investigate the Faraday rotation measure (RM) of the cores; the RM is expected
to increase with observing frequency if core positions depend on frequency due
to synchrotron self-absorption. We find a systematic increase of RMs at higher
observing frequencies in our targets. The RM--$\nu$ relations follow power-laws
with indices distributed around 2, indicating conically expanding outflows
serving as Faraday rotating media. Comparing our KVN data with contemporaneous
optical polarization data from the Steward Observatory for a few sources, we
find indication that the increase of RM with frequency saturates at frequencies
of a few hundreds GHz. This suggests that blazar cores are physical structures
rather than simple $\tau=1$ surfaces. A single region, e.g. a recollimation
shock, might dominate the jet emission downstream of the jet launching region.
We detect a sign change in the observed RMs of CTA 102 on a time scale of
$\approx$1 month, which might be related to new superluminal components
emerging from its core undergoing acceleration/deceleration and/or bending. We
see indication for quasars having higher core RMs than BL Lac objects, which
could be due to denser inflows/outflows in quasars.

highly enriched in carbon at very early times. We explore nucleosynthesis in
massive carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars of $12$--$40\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$

of elements heavier than Fe, mostly up to Sr, by the weak \textsl{s}-process in
stars with initial abundances of ${\rm [CNO]}\gtrsim-1.5$. Even heavier
elements, up to Ba, can be produced for ${\rm [CNO]}\gtrsim-0.5$. The
efficiency of this \textsl{s}-process is sensitive to the initial enhancement
of C (or more generally, CNO) and mass of the star, with the yield increasing
approximately linearly with the initial Fe abundance. The \textsl{s}-process in
CEMP stars of $\gtrsim 20 \,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ with ${\rm [CNO]}\gtrsim -1.5$

at the transitional temperature of a first order phase transition and can be
generalized to the region of the crossover. In order to quantify the feature of
the fixed point, we introduce {\it the width of a set of points}. When all
points in the set are in their mean position within error, the width reaches
its minimum, and all points merge into the fixed point. Using the observable

Most of our knowledge on the stellar component of galaxies is based
on the analysis of distant systems and comes from integrated light data. It is
important to test whether the results of the star formation histories (SFH)
obtained with standard full-spectrum fitting methods are in agreement with
those obtained through colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting (usually
considered the most reliable approach). Aims. We compare SFHs recovered from
both techniques in Leo~A, a Local Group dwarf galaxy whose majority of stars
formed during the last 8 Gyrs. This complements our previous findings in a
field in the Large Magellanic Cloud bar, where star formation has been on-going
since early epochs though at varying rates. Methods. We have used GTC/OSIRIS in
long-slit mode to obtain a high-quality integrated light spectrum by scanning a
selected region within Leo~A, for which a CMD reaching the old main mequence
turn-off (oMSTO) is available from HST. We compared the SFH obtained from the
two datasets, using state-of-art methods of integrated light ({\tt STECKMAP})
and resolved stellar population analysis. In the case of the CMD, we computed
the SFH both from a deep CMD (observed with HST/ACS), and from a shallower one
(archival data from HST/WFPC2). Results. The agreement between the SFHs
recovered from the oMSTO CMD and from full spectrum fitting is remarkable,
particularly regarding the time evolution of the star formation rate. The
overall extremely low metallicity of Leo~A is recovered up to the last 2 Gyrs,
when some discrepancies appear. A relatively high metallicity found for the
youngest stars from the integrated data is a recurring feature that might
indicate that the current models or synthesis codes should be revised, but that
can be significantly mitigated using a more restrictive metallicity range...

focusing due to the 3D reflection of obliquely incident internal waves on a

appropriate experimental parameters. First, we consider a 3D geometry, the
classical set-up to get simple, 2D parallelogram-shaped attractors in which
waves are forced in a direction perpendicular to a sloping bottom. Here,
however, the forcing is of reduced extent in along-slope, transverse direction.
We show how the refractive focusing mechanism explains the formation of
attractors over the whole width of the tank, even away from the forcing region.
Direct numerical simulations confirm the dynamics,emphasize the role of
boundary conditions and reveal the phase shifting in the transversal direction.
Second, we consider a long and narrow tank having an inclined bottom, to simply
reproduce a canal. In this case, the energy is injected in a direction parallel
to the slope. Interestingly, the wave energy ends up forming 2D internal wave
attractors in planes that are transverse to the initial propagation direction.
This focusing mechanism prevents indefinite transmission of most of the
internal wave energy along the canal.

  and on the Scales of Planetesimal Formation","Accepted for publication at ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aac3d4",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The collapse of dust particle clouds directly to km-sized planetesimals is a
promising way to explain the formation of planetesimals, asteroids and comets.
In the past, this collapse has been studied in stratified shearing box
simulations with super-solar dust-to-gas ratio \epsilon, allowing for streaming
instability (SI) and gravitational collapse. This paper studies the
non-stratified SI under dust-to-gas ratios from \epsilon=0.1 up to
\epsilon=1000 without self-gravity. The study covers domain sizes of L=0.1 H,
0.01 H and 0.001 H, in terms of gas disk scale height H, using the PencilCode.
They are performed in radial-azimuthal (2-d) and radial-vertical (2.5-d)
extent. The used particles of St=0.01 and 0.1 mark the upper end of the
expected dust growth. SI-activity is found up to very high dust-to-gas ratios,
providing fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratios and turbulent particle
diffusion \delta. We find an SI-like instability that operates in r-\varphi
even when vertical modes are suppressed. This new azimuthal streaming
instability (aSI) shows similar properties and appearance as the SI. Both, SI
and aSI, show diffusivity at \epsilon=100 only to be two orders of magnitude
lower than at \epsilon=1, suggesting a \delta ~ \epsilon^{-1} relation that is
shallow around \epsilon = 1. The (a)SI ability to concentrate particles is
found to be uncorrelated with its strength in particle turbulence. Finally, we
performed a resolution study to test our findings of the aSI. This paper
stresses out the importance of properly resolving the (a)SI at high dust-to-gas
ratios and planetesimal collapse simulations, leading else wise to potentially
incomplete results.

various perspectives. The well-known Joule-Thomson coefficient is derived with
both the explicit expression and intuitive image presented. Moreover, the
inversion curves showing the relation between the inversion temperature and the
inversion pressure are studied. It is shown that for given inversion pressure,
the inversion temperature of the case $\alpha\neq0$ ($\alpha$ is the Lovelock
parameter) is much lower than that of the case $\alpha=0$. And the inversion
temperature tends to decrease with $\alpha$, in contrast to the effect of the
electric charge. It is also shown that the ratio between the minimum inversion
temperature and the critical temperature decreases with $\alpha$ for
$\alpha\neq0$. Furthermore, the isenthalpic curves are investigated with rich
physics revealed. The intersection point between the isenthalpic curve and the
inversion curve is exactly the inversion point discriminating the heating
process from cooling process. It is shown that both the inversion temperature
and the inversion pressure for $\alpha\neq0$ are much lower for the same given
mass of the black hole, showing the effect of Lovelock gravity. Last but not
the least, we discuss the case of uncharged Lovelock AdS black holes with
interesting feature found. It is shown that the Joule-Thomson coefficient is
always positive, suggesting the expansion is always in the regime of cooling
process. And no inversion temperature exists, in contrast to the case $Q\neq0$.
Isenthalpic curves are also quite different since the temperature increases
monotonically with the pressure when the mass is specified.

gradient delays induce parallel and orthogonal trajectory shifts, which can be

which can be estimated by spoke-by-spoke comparison of k-space samples,
distinctly determine the parameters of the ellipse. Using the proposed method

robustly provides accurate gradient delay estimations even for as few as three

the depth of the water, the tidal conversion can be enhanced in the
supercritical regime or reduced in the subcritical regime with respect to the
large depth situation. Tidal conversion can even be null for some specific
cases. Here, we study experimentally the influence of finite depth on the added
mass coefficients for three diffierent ridge shapes. We first show that at low
forcing frequency the tidal conversion is weakly enhanced by shallow depth for
a semi-circular ridge. In addition, added mass coefficients measured for a
vertical ridge show strong similarities with the ones obtained for the
semi-circular ridge. Nevertheless, the enhancement of the tidal conversion at
low forcing frequency for the vertical ridge has not been observed, in contrast
with its supercritical shape. Finally, we provide the experimental evidence of
a lack of tidal conversion due to the specific shape of a ridge for certain
depth and frequency tuning.

perform a one-dimensional convergence analysis for the nonmultirate fully

resolution. This gives a very efficient method which needs only two iterations.
Numerical results confirm the analysis and show that the 1D nonmultirate

not aware of which versions of the data are received by the other servers. In
this paper, we relax this assumption and study a system where a server may
acquire side information of the data versions propagated to some other servers

aware of which versions have been received by its neighbors in the network
graph. We show that the side information can result in a better storage cost as
compared with the case where there is no side information for some regimes at
the expense of the additional latency associated with exchanging the side
information. Through an information-theoretic converse, we identify surprising
scenarios where the side information may not help in improving the worst-case
storage cost beyond the case where servers have no side information. Finally,
we present a case study over Amazon web services (AWS) that demonstrates the
potential cost reductions that may be obtained by our constructions.

semiotic systems related to the culture in which or for which the program was

understand the transmission of concurrent strains when links of the network are
created and destroyed over time. Here we analyze how network dynamics shapes
the outcome of the competition between an initially endemic strain and an
emerging one, when both strains follow a susceptible-infected-susceptible
dynamics, and spread at time scales comparable with the network evolution one.
Using time-resolved data of close-proximity interactions between patients
admitted to a hospital and medical health care workers, we analyze the impact
of temporal patterns and initial conditions on the dominance diagram and
coexistence time. We find that strong variations in activity volume cause the
probability that the emerging strain replaces the endemic one to be highly
sensitive to the time of emergence. The temporal structure of the network
shapes the dominance diagram, with significant variations in the replacement
probability (for a given set of epidemiological parameters) observed from the
empirical network and a randomized version of it. Our work contributes towards
the description of the complex interplay between competing pathogens on

important role in the secular evolution of galaxies, including the Milky Way.
In particular, the velocity distribution of individual stars in our galaxy is
useful to shed light on stellar dynamics, and provides information
complementary to that inferred from the integrated light of external galaxies.
However, since a wide variety of models reproduce the distribution of velocity
and the velocity dispersion observed in the Milky Way, we look for signatures
of the bar on higher-order moments of the line-of-sight velocity ($V_{los}$)
distribution. We make use of two different numerical simulations --one that has
developed a bar and one that remains nearly axisymmetric-- to compare them with
observations in the latest APOGEE data release (SDSS DR14). This comparison
reveals three interesting structures that support the notion that the Milky Way
is a barred galaxy. A high skewness region found at positive longitudes
constrains the orientation angle of the bar, and is incompatible with the
orientation of the bar at $\ell=0^\circ$ proposed in previous studies. We also
analyse the $V_{los}$ distributions in three regions, and introduce the
Hellinger distance to quantify the differences among them. Our results show a
strong non-Gaussian distribution both in the data and in the barred model,
confirming the qualitative conclusions drawn from the velocity maps. In
contrast to earlier work, we conclude it is possible to infer the presence of
the bar from the kurtosis distribution.

compressive signal measurements with finite precision representation, i.e., a
mandatory process in any practical sensor design. To characterize the signal
reconstruction quality in this framework, most of the existing theoretical
analyses lie heavily on the quantization of sub-Gaussian random projections
(e.g., Gaussian or Bernoulli). We show here that a simple uniform scalar
quantizer is compatible with a large class of random sensing matrices known to
respect, with high probability, the restricted isometry property (RIP).
Critically, this compatibility arises from the addition of a uniform random
vector, or ""dithering"", to the linear signal observations before quantization.
In this setting, we prove the existence of (at least) one signal reconstruction
method, i.e., the projected back projection (PBP), whose reconstruction error
decays when the number of quantized measurements increases. This holds with
high probability in the estimation of sparse signals and low-rank matrices. We
validate numerically the predicted error decay as the number of measurements
increases.

long-term variability (i.e. on timescales of years and beyond) can be
reconstructed by means of models that describe short-term variability (i.e.
days) using solar proxies as inputs. Preminger and Walton (2005, GRL, 32,
14109) showed that the relationship between spectral solar irradiance and
proxies of magnetic-flux emergence, such as the daily sunspot area, can be
described in the framework of linear system theory by means of the impulse
response. We significantly refine that empirical model by removing spurious
solar-rotational effects and by including an additional term that captures
long-term variations. Our results show that long-term variability cannot be
reconstructed from the short-term response of the spectral irradiance, which
cautions the extension of solar proxy models to these timescales. In addition,
we find that the solar response is nonlinear in such a way that cannot be
corrected simply by applying a rescaling to sunspot area.

study focuses on the integrated impact of mixing processes induced by a
propagative normal mode-1 over long term experiments in an idealised setup. The
internal wave dynamics and the evolution of the density profile are followed
using the light attenuation technique. Diagnostics of the turbulent diffusivity
$K_{T}$ and background potential energy $BPE$ are provided. Mixing effects
result in a partially mixed layer colocated with the region of maximum shear
induced by the forcing normal mode. The maximum measured turbulent diffusivity
is 250 times larger than the molecular value, showing that diapycnal mixing is
largely enhanced by small scale turbulent processes. Intermittency and
reversible energy transfers are discussed to bridge the gap between the present
diagnostic and the larger values measured in Dossmann et al, Experiments in
Fluids, 57(8), 132 (2016). The mixing efficiency $\eta$ is assessed by relating
the $BPE$ growth to the linearized $KE$ input. One finds a value of
$\Gamma=12-19\%$ larger than the mixing efficiency in the case of breaking
interfacial wave. After several hours of forcing, the development of staircases
in the density profile is observed. This mechanism has been previously observed
in experiments with weak homogeneous turbulence and explained by argument. The

The moat flow associated with this very large spot is quantitatively compared
to that of a medium and a small sunspot to determine the extend of the moat
flow in different environments. We employ continuum images and magnetograms of
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) as well as extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
images at $\lambda$160 nm of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), both on

time-averaged flow maps ($\pm$6 hours around meridian passage) and radial
averages of photometric, magnetic and flow properties. Flow fields of a small-

the results. All sunspots show the outward moat flow and the advection of
moving magnetic features (MMFs). However, the extent of the moat flow varies

distributed sensor nodes (SNs) for estimating an unknown parameter. It is
revealed that in order to minimize the mean square error (MSE) for the
estimation, the UAV should collect the data from as many SNs as possible, based
on which an optimization problem is formulated to design the UAV's trajectory
subject to its practical mobility constraints. Although the problem is
non-convex and NP-hard, we show that the optimal UAV trajectory consists of
connected line segments only. With this simplification, an efficient suboptimal
solution is proposed by leveraging the classic traveling salesman problem (TSP)
method and applying convex optimization techniques. Simulation results show
that the proposed trajectory design achieves significant performance gains in
terms of the number of SNs whose data are successfully collected, as compared
to other benchmark schemes.

firewall. In the wake of these proposals, we here propose the singularity
itself as a ""firepoint"" capable to break the entanglement between the ""int"" and

In the first way, the singularity, coming in contact with the the ""int"" state,
produces a pure state outside the horizon, but it violates causality allowing
people inside the black hole to send signals to the outside. The second way
consists of a map that breaks the entanglement between the interior and
exterior of the black hole still using the singularity yet without violating
causality. The monogamy theorem is not violated whether in the first where the

spin symmetry in the large $N$ limit. Their single-trace operators consist of a
tower of weakly broken currents, as well as a scalar $\sigma$ of approximate
twist $1$ or $2$. We study the consequences of crossing symmetry for the
four-point correlator of $\sigma$ in a $1/N$ expansion, using analytic
bootstrap techniques. To order $1/N$ we show that crossing symmetry fixes the
contribution from the tower of currents, providing an alternative derivation of
well-known results by Maldacena and Zhiboedov. When $\sigma$ has twist $1$ its
OPE receives a contribution from the exchange of $\sigma$ itself with an
arbitrary coefficient, due to the existence of a marginal sextic coupling. We
develop the machinery to determine the corrections to the OPE data of
double-trace operators due to this, and to similar exchanges. This in turns
allows us to fix completely the correlator up to three known truncated
solutions to crossing. We then proceed to study the problem to order $1/N^2$.
We find that crossing implies the appearance of odd-twist double-trace
operators, and calculate their OPE coefficients in a large spin expansion.
Also, surprisingly, crossing at order $1/N^2$, implies non-trivial $O(1/N)$
anomalous dimensions for even-twist double-trace operators, even though such
contributions do not appear in the four-point function at order $1/N$ (in the
case where there is no scalar exchange). We argue that this phenomenon arises
due to operator mixing. Finally, we analyse the bosonic vector model with a
sextic coupling without gauge interactions, and determine the order $1/N^2$
corrections to the dimensions of twist-$2$ double-trace operators.

centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 5.44$ TeV, using
the ALICE detector at the CERN LHC. The J/$\psi$ meson is reconstructed via its
decay into a muon pair, in the centre-of-mass rapidity interval $2.5<y<4$ and
down to zero transverse momentum. In this Letter, the nuclear modification
factors $R_{\rm AA}$ for inclusive J/$\psi$, measured in the centrality range
0-90% as well as in the centrality intervals 0-20% and 20-90% are presented.
The $R_{\rm AA}$ values are compared to previously published results for Pb-Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 5.02$ TeV and to the calculation of a
transport model. A good agreement is found between Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb results as
well as between data and the model.

  Adversarial Networks","IJCAI 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Existing deep learning methods of video recognition usually require a large
number of labeled videos for training. But for a new task, videos are often
unlabeled and it is also time-consuming and labor-intensive to annotate them.
Instead of human annotation, we try to make use of existing fully labeled
images to help recognize those videos. However, due to the problem of domain
shifts and heterogeneous feature representations, the performance of
classifiers trained on images may be dramatically degraded for video
recognition tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called
Hierarchical Generative Adversarial Networks (HiGAN), to enhance recognition in
videos (i.e., target domain) by transferring knowledge from images (i.e.,
source domain). The HiGAN model consists of a \emph{low-level} conditional GAN
and a \emph{high-level} conditional GAN. By taking advantage of these two-level
adversarial learning, our method is capable of learning a domain-invariant
feature representation of source images and target videos. Comprehensive
experiments on two challenging video recognition datasets (i.e. UCF101 and
HMDB51) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method when compared with
the existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.

when adding an extra cavity mode, the low-energy description of this system can
additionally exhibit an $SO(3)$ rotational symmetry which can be spontaneously
broken. This leads to a superradiant phase transition in all the cavities
simultaneously, and the appearance of Goldstone and amplitude modes in the
excitation spectrum. We determine the phase diagram of the system, which shows
the emergence and breaking of the continuous symmetries and displays first- and
second-order phase transitions. We also obtain the excitation spectrum for each
phase and discuss the atomic self-organized structures that emerge in the
different superradiant phases. We argue that coupling the atoms equally to $n$
different modes will in general generate a global $SO(n)$ symmetry if the mode
frequencies can be tuned to the same value.

  analysis of neuroimaging data",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The mitigation of false positives is an important issue when conducting
multiple hypothesis testing. The most popular paradigm for false positives
mitigation in high-dimensional applications is via the control of the false
discovery rate (FDR). Multiple testing data from neuroimaging experiments can
be very large, and reduced precision storage of such data is often required.
Reduced precision computation is often a problem in the analysis of legacy data
and data arising from legacy pipelines. We present a method for FDR control
that is applicable in cases where only p\text{-values} or test statistics (with
common and known null distribution) are available, and when those
p\text{-values} or test statistics are encoded in a reduced precision format.
Our method is based on an empirical-Bayes paradigm where the probit
transformation of the p\text{-values} (called the z\text{-scores}) are modeled
as a two-component mixture of normal distributions. Due to the reduced
precision of the p\text{-values} or test statistics, the usual approach for
fitting mixture models may not be feasible. We instead use a binned-data
technique, which can be proved to consistently estimate the z\text{-score}
distribution parameters under mild correlation assumptions, as is often the
case in neuroimaging data. A simulation study shows that our methodology is
competitive when compared with popular alternatives, especially with data in
the presence of misspecification. We demonstrate the applicability of our
methodology in practice via a brain imaging study of mice.

  Features","6 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Machine Learning and Robotics, the semantic content of visual features is
usually provided to the system by a human who interprets its content. On the
contrary, strictly unsupervised approaches have difficulties relating the
statistics of sensory inputs to their semantic content without also relying on
prior knowledge introduced in the system. We proposed in this paper to tackle
this problem from a sensorimotor perspective. In line with the Sensorimotor
Contingencies Theory, we make the fundamental assumption that the semantic
content of sensory inputs at least partially stems from the way an agent can
actively transform it. We illustrate our approach by formalizing how simple
visual features can induce invariants in a naive agent's sensorimotor
experience, and evaluate it on a simple simulated visual system. Without any a
priori knowledge about the way its sensorimotor information is encoded, we show
how an agent can characterize the uniformity and edge-ness of the visual
features it interacts with.

These new results reveal the collision energy dependence of the global

medium created in non-central heavy-ion collisions at the highest RHIC

theoretical predictions from a hydrodynamic model and from the AMPT (A
Multi-Phase Transport) model. The polarization is larger in more peripheral
collisions, and depends weakly on the hyperon's transverse momentum and
pseudorapidity $\eta^H$ within $|\eta^H|<1$. An indication of the polarization
dependence on the event-by-event charge asymmetry is observed at the $2\sigma$
level, suggesting a possible contribution to the polarization from the axial
current induced by the initial magnetic field.

models is severely constrained if one combines the latest muon $(g-2)$ data
with various neutrino experiments, such as neutrino trident production, $\nu
-e$ and $\nu -q$ elastic scattering, etc. In a supersymmetric
$U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model, a larger region of parameter space opens up,
thus enabling one to explore otherwise forbidden regions of parameter space in
nonsupersymmetric models involving the new gauge coupling ($g_X$) and the mass
of the $Z^\prime$ gauge boson ($M_{Z^{\prime}}$) . We show that the minimal
model with the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) field content is
strongly disfavored from $Z$-boson decay and neutrino data. We also show that
the nonminimal model with two extra singlet superfields can lead to correct
neutrino masses and mixing involving both tree-level and one-loop
contributions. We find that, in this model, both muon $(g-2)$ and neutrino data
may be simultaneously explained in a parameter region consistent with
experimental observations. In addition, we observe that the muon $(g-2)$
anomaly can be accommodated even with higher values of electroweak sparticle
masses compared to the MSSM. Charged lepton-flavor-violating processes (like
$\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$, $\tau\rightarrow \mu\gamma$, etc.) may have
potentially large branching ratios in this scenario. Depending on the magnitude
of the supersymmetry contribution to these processes, they may constrain
hitherto unconstrained regions of the $M_{Z^{\prime}}-g_X$ parameter space.
However, we find that these branching fractions never exceed their upper bounds
in a region where both muon $(g-2)$ and neutrino oscillation data can be
simultaneously accommodated.

multiple Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations are developed to
plan optimal routes for the UAV and the refueling vehicle taking into account
the feasible set of refueling sites generated in stage one. The performance of

range, which can be compressed for the QCD axion to (100, 450) meV in the
absence of fine tuning. Future experiments and large scale surveys,
particularly the International Axion Observatory (IAXO) and EUCLID, should have
the capability to directly test this scenario.

debris, thought to arise from the tidal disruption of rocky bodies originating
in the star's remnant planetary system. This paper investigates the evolution
of such discs if they are very massive, as may be the case if their progenitor
was a terrestrial planet, moon, or dwarf planet. Assuming the discs are
physically thin and flat, like Saturn's rings, their evolution is governed by
Poynting-Robertson drag or viscous spreading, where the disc's effective
viscosity is due to self-gravity wakes. For discs with masses >10^26 g, located
in the outer parts of the tidal disruption zone, viscous spreading dominates
the evolution, and mass is transported both in- and outwards. When
outwards-spreading material flows beyond the Roche limit, it coagulates into
new (minor) planets in a process analogous to the ongoing formation of moonlets
at the outer edge of Saturn's rings. The newly formed bodies migrate outwards
by exchanging angular momentum with the disc and coalesce into larger objects
through mutual collisions. Eventually, the disc's Roche-limit overflow recycles
tens of percent of the original disc mass; most ends up in a single large body
near 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the disc's outer edge. Hence, the recycling
of a tidally disrupted super-Earth, for example, could yield an Earth-mass
planet on a ~10-h orbit, located in the habitable zone for 2-to-10-Gyr-old
white dwarfs. The recycling process also creates a population of smaller bodies
just outside the Roche limit, which may explain the minor planets recently
postulated to orbit WD 1145+017.

against the philosophical worldview of local realism. A Bell test requires
spatially distributed entanglement, fast and high-efficiency detection and
unpredictable measurement settings. Although technology can satisfy the first
two of these requirements, the use of physical devices to choose settings in a
Bell test involves making assumptions about the physics that one aims to test.
Bell himself noted this weakness in using physical setting choices and argued
that human `free will' could be used rigorously to ensure unpredictability in
Bell tests. Here we report a set of local-realism tests using human choices,
which avoids assumptions about predictability in physics. We recruited about
100,000 human participants to play an online video game that incentivizes fast,
sustained input of unpredictable selections and illustrates Bell-test
methodology. The participants generated 97,347,490 binary choices, which were
directed via a scalable web platform to 12 laboratories on five continents,
where 13 experiments tested local realism using photons, single atoms, atomic
ensembles, and superconducting devices. Over a 12-hour period on 30 November
2016, participants worldwide provided a sustained data flow of over 1,000 bits
per second to the experiments, which used different human-generated data to
choose each measurement setting. The observed correlations strongly contradict
local realism and other realistic positions in bipartite and tripartite
scenarios. Project outcomes include closing the `freedom-of-choice loophole'
(the possibility that the setting choices are influenced by `hidden variables'
to correlate with the particle properties), the utilization of video-game
methods for rapid collection of human generated randomness, and the use of
networking techniques for global participation in experimental science.

respectively, as supermodular width and superadditive width. Both are
formulated based on natural witnesses of complementarity. We show that both
measures are robust by proving that they, respectively, characterize the gap of
monotone set functions from being submodular and subadditive. Thus, they define
two new hierarchies over monotone set functions, which we will refer to as
Supermodular Width (SMW) hierarchy and Superadditive Width (SAW) hierarchy,
with level 0 of the hierarchies resting exactly on submodular and subadditive
functions, respectively.
  We present a comprehensive comparative analysis of the SMW hierarchy and the
Supermodular Degree (SD) hierarchy, defined by Feige and Izsak. We prove that
the SMW hierarchy is strictly more expressive than the SD hierarchy. We show
that previous results regarding approximation guarantees for welfare and
constrained maximization as well as regarding the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of
simple auctions can be extended without any loss from the SD hierarchy to the
SMW hierarchy. We also establish almost matching information-theoretical lower
bounds. The combination of these approximation and hardness results illustrate
that the SMW hierarchy provides an accurate characterization of ""near
submodularity"" needed for maximization approximation. While SD and SMW
hierarchies support nontrivial bounds on the PoA of simple auctions, we show
that our SAW hierarchy seems to capture more intrinsic properties needed to
realize the efficiency of simple auctions. So far, the SAW hierarchy provides
the best dependency for the PoA of Single-bid Auction, and is nearly as
competitive as the Maximum over Positive Hypergraphs (MPH) hierarchy for
Simultaneous Item First Price Auction (SIA). We provide almost tight lower
bounds for the PoA of both auctions with respect to the SAW hierarchy.

exciton states in MoSe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$ monolayers have so far been elusive due
to their low oscillator strength and strong inhomogeneous broadening. Here we
show that encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride results in emission line

this non-linear optical process. At the origin of upconversion our model
calculations suggest an exciton-exciton (Auger) scattering mechanism specific

gravitational instabilities in the stars and gas are able to reproduce the

of stellar feedback which create large holes similar to those observed in M33,
whilst lower levels of feedback tend to produce a large amount of small scale

detected in the M33 disc. The gas component appears to have a significant role
in producing the structure, so if there is little feedback, both the gas and
stars organise into clear spiral arms, likely due to a lower combined $Q$
(using gas and stars), and the ready ability of cold gas to undergo spiral
shocks. By contrast models with higher feedback have weaker spiral structure,
especially in the stellar component, compared to grand design galaxies. We did
not see a large difference in the behaviour of $Q_{stars}$ with most of these
models, however, because $Q_{stars}$ stayed relatively constant unless the disc
was more strongly unstable. Our models suggest that although the stars produce
some underlying spiral structure, this is relatively weak, and the gas physics
has a considerable role in producing the large scale structure of the ISM in
flocculent spirals.

higher-order perturbative corrections beyond what can currently be calculated

corrections systematically enhanced for a large ratio of the centre-of-mass
energy to the transverse momentum of the observed jets. These effects are
relevant in the analysis of e.g. Higgs-boson production in association with
dijets within the cuts devised to enhance the contribution from Vector Boson
Fusion (VBF).
  HEJ obtains an all-order approximation, based on logarithmic corrections
which are matched to fixed-order results in the cases where these can be
readily evaluated. In this paper we present an improved framework for the
matching utilised in HEJ, which for merging of tree-level results is
mathematically equivalent to the one used so far. However, by starting from
events generated at fixed order and supplementing these with the all-order
summation, it is computationally simpler to obtain matching to calculations of
high multiplicity.
  We demonstrate that the impact of the higher-multiplicity matching on
predictions is small for the gluon-fusion (GF) contribution of Higgs-boson
production in association with dijets in the VBF-region, so perturbative
stability against high-multiplicity matching has been achieved within HEJ. We
match the improved HEJ prediction to the inclusive next-to-leading order (NLO)
cross section and compare to pure NLO in the h->photon photon channel with
standard VBF cuts.

possible origin for FRBs. Strange stars, which are composed of almost equal
numbers of u, d, and s quarks, may be encapsulated by a thin crust of normal
hadronic matter. When a strange star accretes matter from its environment, the
crust becomes heavier and heavier. It may finally collapse, leading to the
release of a large amount of magnetic energy and plenty of electron/positron
pairs on a very short timescale. Electron/positron pairs in the polar cap
region of the strange star can be accelerated to relativistic velocities,
streaming along the magnetic field lines to form a thin shell. FRBs are
produced by coherent emission from these electrons when the shell is expanding.
Basic characteristics of observed FRBs can be explained in our model.

when the system modeling requires numerical calculations to achieve realistic

become a mere users of computational tools without capturing the essence of
formulation and further problem solution. It is, therefore, necessary for
instructors to find innovating ways, allowing students developing of their
ability to deal with mathematical modelling. To address this issue one can
highlight the use of Benford's law, thanks to its simple formulation, easy
computational implementation and wide possibility for applications. Indeed,
this law enables students to carry out their own data analysis with use of free
software packages. This law is among the several power or scaling laws found in
biological systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, this law has not
been contemplated in Cell Biophysics yet. Beyond its vast applications in many
fields, neuromuscular junction represents a remarkable substrate for learning
and teaching of complex system. Thus, in this work, we applied both classical
and a generalized form of Benford's Law, to examine if electrophysiological
data recorded from neuromuscular junction conforms the anomalous number law.
The results indicated that nerve-muscle communications conform the generalized
Benford's law better than the seminal formulation. From our
electrophysiological measurements a biological scenario is used to interpret
the theoretical analysis.

case that learning should be promoted everywhere and anytime. What seems to be
a promising opportunity for all pupils to learn coding in an entertaining way
raises the question of whether such game based concepts also help to fix the
gender gap of women in IT related fields. Gender differences are already
present in secondary schools. These are the years where first career choices
but also low levels of participation in technical subjects occur. To address
this gender bias, a goal of the European project No One Left Behind (NOLB) was
to integrate Pocket Code, an app developed by Catrobat, a free open source
non-profit project at the University of Technology in Graz/Austria, into
different school subjects, thus making coding more accessible and attractive to
female pupils. During the period of this project (2015-2017), teachers were
supported to guide their pupils in the learning processes by constructing ideas
and realizing them through game design. For this paper an analysis of submitted
programs according to their game design has been performed. In detail, the
evaluation considered formal game elements, gaming structures, and used
graphics, as well as Pocket Code specific aspects. The programs analysis showed
commonly used design patterns by genders and suggests preferred game design
characteristics of female teenagers. This analysis helps to build a more

Sun's corona is an important influencing factor in the process of interchange
reconnection, whereby plasma is exchanged between open and closed flux domains.
Maps of the magnetic squashing factor at the radial outer boundary in coronal
field models reveal the presence of the so-called `S-web', and suggest that
interchange reconnection could potentially deposit closed coronal material into
high-latitude regions far from the heliospheric current sheet. Here we
demonstrate that certain features of the S-web reveal the underlying
topological structure of the magnetic field. Specifically, in order for the
arcing bands of highly squashed magnetic flux of the S-web to terminate or
intersect away from the helmet streamer apex, there must be a null spine line
that maps a finite segment of the photospheric open-closed boundary up to a
singular point in the open flux domain. We propose that this association
between null spine lines and arc termination points may be used to identify
locations in the heliosphere that are preferential for the appearance of solar
energetic particles or slow solar wind plasma with certain characteristics.

""shallow"" settings. In both cases, significant hyperparameter tuning is often
required to achieve good performance. Furthermore, when nonlinear function
approximation is used, non-stationarity in the state representation can lead to
learning instability. A variety of techniques exist to combat this --- most
notably large experience replay buffers or the use of multiple parallel actors.
These techniques come at the cost of moving away from the online RL problem as
it is traditionally formulated (i.e., a single agent learning online without
maintaining a large database of training examples). Meta-learning can
potentially help with both these issues by tuning hyperparameters online and
allowing the algorithm to more robustly adjust to non-stationarity in a
problem. This paper applies meta-gradient descent to derive a set of step-size
tuning algorithms specifically for online RL control with eligibility traces.
Our novel technique, Metatrace, makes use of an eligibility trace analogous to
methods like $TD(\lambda)$. We explore tuning both a single scalar step-size
and a separate step-size for each learned parameter. We evaluate Metatrace
first for control with linear function approximation in the classic mountain
car problem and then in a noisy, non-stationary version. Finally, we apply
Metatrace for control with nonlinear function approximation in 5 games in the
Arcade Learning Environment where we explore how it impacts learning speed and
robustness to initial step-size choice. Results show that the meta-step-size
parameter of Metatrace is easy to set, Metatrace can speed learning, and
Metatrace can allow an RL algorithm to deal with non-stationarity in the

information systems (IS) field almost since its inception. Knowledge has been
viewed in several ways in the prior literature, including as a state of mind,
an object, a process, access to information, and a capability. A commonly-used
definition characterizes knowledge as a justified belief that increases an
entity's capacity for effective action (Alavi and Leidner 2001, p. 109).
Relatedly, knowledge management (KM) has been defined as a systemic process to
acquire, organize, and communicate individual knowledge so that others may make
use of it (Beck et al. 2014). Knowledge-management systems (KMSs) support these
processes for creating, exchanging, and storing knowledge (Beck et al. 2014),
and have been viewed as being either repository- based or network-based
(Kankanhalli et al. 2005). In an attempt to provide a useful resource for
scholars interested in KM, we take stock of the pertinent research published in
MISQ. More specifically, the goal of this curation is to serve as a living
document that will offer a starting point for future KM research. This curation
highlights the 44 articles with a primary focus on KM (Table 1). The articles
address theoretical and conceptual issues, provide methodological guidance, and
use a wide range of quantitative and qualitative research methods. To define
the scope of this curation, we excluded: (1) articles in which KM is used as
part of another construct; (2) some early articles that were practice- oriented
with limited scholarly orientation; and (3) articles that focus on knowledge
(such as the knowledge requirements of IS professionals) but not on KM.

covering a total contiguous area of 23.57 deg2. We apply a colour-magnitude
diagram (CMD) reconstruction method that returns the best-fitting star
formation rate SFR(t), age--metallicity relation, distance and mean reddening,
together with their confidence intervals, for each subregion. With respect to
previous analyses, we use a far larger set of VMC data, updated stellar models,
and fit the two available CMDs (Y-Ks versus Ks and J-Ks versus Ks)
independently. The results allow us to derive a more complete and more reliable
picture of how the mean distances, extinction values, star formation rate, and
metallicities vary across the SMC, and provide a better description of the
populations that form its Bar and Wing. We conclude that the SMC has formed a
total mass of (5.31+-0.05)x10^8 Msun in stars over its lifetime. About two
thirds of this mass is expected to be still locked in stars and stellar
remnants. 50 per cent of the mass was formed prior to an age of 6.3 Gyr, and 80
per cent was formed between 8 and 3.5 Gyr ago. We also illustrate the likely
distribution of stellar ages and metallicities in different parts of the CMD,

goal-oriented, and interactive experiences in classes; thereby supporting the
transfer of knowledge for learning in a fun and pedagogic manner. A key element
of the ongoing European project No One Left Behind (NOLB) is to integrate a
game-making teaching framework (GMTF) into the educational app Pocket Code.
Pocket Code allows learners to create programs in a visual Lego-style way to
facilitate learning how to code at secondary high schools. The concept of the
NOLB GMTF is based on principles of the Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
model. This framework provides a coherent approach to learning and teaching by
integrating leisure oriented gaming methods into multi-discipline curricula.
One output of this framework is the integration of game-based methods via game
templates that refer to didactical scenarios that include a refined set of
genres, assets, rules, challenges, and strategies. These templates allows: 1)
teachers to start with a well-structured program, and 2) pupils to add content
and adjust the code to integrate their own ideas. During the project game
genres such as adventure, action, and quiz, as well as rewards or victory point
mechanisms, have been embedded into different subjects, e.g., science,
mathematics, and arts. The insights gained during the class hours were used to
generate 13 game templates, which are integrated in Create@School (a new
version of the Pocket Code app which targets schools). To test the efficiency
of these templates, user experience (UX) tests were conducted during classes to
compare games created by pupils who used templates and those who started to
create a game from scratch. Preliminary results showed that these templates
allow learners to focus on subject-relevant problem solving activities rather
than on understanding the functionality of the app.

axion production in the Sun, which has never been discussed previously in the
literature. This novel mechanism of the axion production is based on the
so-called Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) Dark Matter Model. These axions will be
produced in addition to well studied axions emitted due to the Primakoff
effect. The AQN model was originally invented as a natural explanation of the
observed ratio $\Omega_{\rm dark} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ when the DM and
visible matter densities assume the same order of magnitude values,
irrespectively to the axion mass $m_a$ or initial misalignment angle
$\theta_0$. This model, without adjustment of any parameters, reproduces
reasonably the intensity of the extreme UV (EUV) radiation from the solar
corona as a result of the AQN annihilation events with the solar material. This
extra energy released in corona represents a resolution, within AQN framework,
a long standing puzzle known in the literature as the ""solar corona heating
mystery"". The same annihilation events also produce the relativistic axions.
This represents a new mechanism of the axion production, and constitutes the
main subject of this work. The flux of these axions is unambiguously fixed in
this model and expressed in terms of the EUV luminosity from corona. We also
compute the spectral properties of these axions and make few comments on the
potentials for the discovery of these solar axions by the upgraded CAST (CERN

equations with fractional Laplacian viscosity in the whole space. In stark
contrast to the Camassa-Holm equations without any nonlocal effect, to our best
knowledge, little has been known on the large time behavior and convergence for
the nonlocal equations under study. We first study the large time behavior of
solutions. We then discuss the relation between the equations under
consideration and the imcompressible Navier-Stokes equations with fractional
Laplacian viscosity (INSF). The main difficulty to achieve them lies in the
fractional Laplacian viscosity. Fortunately, by employing some properties of
fractional Laplacian, in particular, the fractional Leibniz chain rule and the
fractional Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev type estimates, the high and low
frequency splitting method and the Fourier splitting method, we first establish
the large time behavior concerning non-uniform decay and algebraic decay of
solutions to the nonlocal equations under study. In particular, under the
critical case $s=\dfrac{n}{4}$, the nonlocal version of Ladyzhenskaya's
inequality is skillfully used, and the smallness of initial data in several
Sobolev spaces is required to gain the non-uniform decay and algebraic decay.
On the other hand, by means of the fractional heat kernel estimates, we figure
out the relation between the nonlocal equations under consideration and the
equations (INSF). Specifically, we prove that the solution to the Camassa-Holm
equations with nonlocal viscosity converges strongly as the filter parameter
$\alpha\rightarrow~0$ to a solution of the equations (INSF).

statistical analysis techniques to develop perioperative models to predict the
risk of AKI (risk during the first 3 days, 7 days, and until the discharge day)

heart rate. For an individual patient, the preoperative model produces a
probabilistic AKI risk score, which will be enriched by integrating
intraoperative statistical features through a machine learning stacking
approach inside a random forest classifier. We compared the performance of our

utilizing the formalism developed for the analogous process in neutron star
crusts. We find that the contribution to the neutrino emissivity due to the
presence of a crystalline quark-hadron mixed phase is substantial compared to
other mechanisms at fairly low temperatures ($\lesssim 10^9$ K) and quark
fractions ($\lesssim 30\%$), and that contributions due to lattice vibrations
are insignificant compared to static-lattice contributions. There are a number
of open issues that need to be addressed in a future study on the neutrino
emission rates caused by electron-quark blob bremsstrahlung. Chiefly among them
are the role of collective oscillations of matter, electron band structures,
and of gaps at the boundaries of the Brillouin zones on bremsstrahlung, as
discussed in the summary section of this paper. We hope this paper will
stimulate studies addressing these issues.

Many techniques are used to solve this problem like dynamic programming,

use dynamic programming techniques to find the shortest path in wireless mesh
networks due to their generality, reduction of complexity and facilitation of
numerical computation, simplicity in incorporating constraints, and their
conformity to the stochastic nature of some problems. The routing problem is a
multi-objective optimization problem with some constraints such as path
capacity and end-to-end delay. Single-constraint routing problems and solutions
using Dijkstra, Bellman- Ford, and Floyd-Warshall algorithms are proposed in
this work with a discussion on the difference between them. These algorithms
find the shortest route through finding the optimal rate between two nodes in
the wireless networks but with bounded end-to-end delay. The Dijkstra-based
algorithm is especially favorable in terms of processing time. We also present
a comparison between our proposed single-constraint Dijkstra-based routing
algorithm and the mesh routing algorithm (MRA) existing in the literature to
clarify the merits of the former.

the aim of this trial was to assess the practical feasibility of an easy

the accuracy and accordance of the open-source based segmentation algorithm
GrowCut (GC) was assessed through the comparison to the manually generated
ground truth of the same anatomy using 10 CT lower jaw data-sets from the
clinical routine. Assessment parameters were the segmentation time, the volume,
the voxel number, the Dice Score (DSC) and the Hausdorff distance (HD). Overall
segmentation times were about one minute. Mean DSC values of over 85% and HD
below 33.5 voxel could be achieved. Statistical differences between the
assessment parameters were not significant (p<0.05) and correlation
coefficients were close to the value one (r > 0.94). Complete functional stable
and time saving segmentations with high accuracy and high positive correlation
could be performed by the presented interactive open-source based approach. In
the cranio-maxillofacial complex the used method could represent an algorithmic
alternative for image-based segmentation in the clinical practice for e.g.
surgical treatment planning or visualization of postoperative results and
offers several advantages. Systematic comparisons to other segmentation
approaches or with a greater data amount are areas of future works.

(V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) is imperative for the autonomous
driving cars, the understanding of realistic vehicle-to-everything (V2X) models
is needed. While previous research has mostly targeted vehicular models in
which vehicles are randomly distributed and the variable of carrier frequency
was not considered, a more realistic analysis of the V2X model is proposed in
this paper. We use a one-dimensional (1D) Poisson cluster process (PCP) to
model a realistic scenario of vehicle distribution in a perpendicular cross
line road urban area and compare the coverage results with the previous
research that distributed vehicles randomly by Poisson Point Process (PPP).
Moreover, we incorporate the effect of different carrier frequencies, mmWave
and sub-6 GHz, to our analysis by altering the antenna radiation pattern
accordingly. Results indicated that while the effect of clustering led to lower
outage, using mmWave had even more significance in leading to lower outage.
Moreover, line-of-sight (LoS) interference links are shown to be more dominant
in lowering the outage than the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links even though they
are less in number. The analytical results give insight into designing and
analyzing the urban V2X channels, and are verified by actual urban area
three-dimensional (3D) ray-tracing simulation.

for enabling ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in vehicular
networks is proposed. The objective is to minimize the network-wide power
consumption of vehicular users (VUEs) while ensuring high reliability in terms
of probabilistic queuing delays. In particular, a reliability measure is
defined to characterize extreme events (i.e., when vehicles' queue lengths
exceed a predefined threshold with non-negligible probability) using extreme
value theory (EVT). Leveraging principles from federated learning (FL), the
distribution of these extreme events corresponding to the tail distribution of
queues is estimated by VUEs in a decentralized manner. Finally, Lyapunov
optimization is used to find the joint transmit power and resource allocation
policies for each VUE in a distributed manner. The proposed solution is
validated via extensive simulations using a Manhattan mobility model. It is
shown that FL enables the proposed distributed method to estimate the tail
distribution of queues with an accuracy that is very close to a centralized
solution with up to 79\% reductions in the amount of data that need to be
exchanged. Furthermore, the proposed method yields up to 60\% reductions of
VUEs with large queue lengths, without an additional power consumption,
compared to an average queue-based baseline. Compared to systems with fixed
power consumption and focusing on queue stability while minimizing average
power consumption, the reduction in extreme events of the proposed method is
about two orders of magnitude.

elastic systems follow the same topological classification. In addition, we
also found that non-rectilinear constraints offers a natural pass towards

learning models that generate synthetic data from limited genuine datasets.
GANs are on the frontier as further extension of deep learning into many
domains (e.g., medicine, robotics, content synthesis) requires massive sets of
labeled data that is generally either unavailable or prohibitively costly to
collect. Although GANs are gaining prominence in various fields, there are no
accelerators for these new models. In fact, GANs leverage a new operator,
called transposed convolution, that exposes unique challenges for hardware
acceleration. This operator first inserts zeros within the multidimensional
input, then convolves a kernel over this expanded array to add information to
the embedded zeros. Even though there is a convolution stage in this operator,
the inserted zeros lead to underutilization of the compute resources when a
conventional convolution accelerator is employed. We propose the GANAX
architecture to alleviate the sources of inefficiency associated with the
acceleration of GANs using conventional convolution accelerators, making the
first GAN accelerator design possible. We propose a reorganization of the
output computations to allocate compute rows with similar patterns of zeros to
adjacent processing engines, which also avoids inconsequential multiply-adds on
the zeros. This compulsory adjacency reclaims data reuse across these
neighboring processing engines, which had otherwise diminished due to the
inserted zeros. The reordering breaks the full SIMD execution model, which is
prominent in convolution accelerators. Therefore, we propose a unified
MIMD-SIMD design for GANAX that leverages repeated patterns in the computation
to create distinct microprograms that execute concurrently in SIMD mode.
