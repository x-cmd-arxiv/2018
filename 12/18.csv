common the use of bimetallic nanoparticles as catalysts, despite the fact that
their exact role is not fully understood. We therefore analyze the effect of
the catalyst' s chemical composition on the structure of the resulting SWCNTs
by comparing three bimetallic catalysts (FeRu, CoRu and NiRu). A specific
synthesis protocol is designed to impede the catalyst nanoparticle coalescence
mechanisms and stabilize their diameter distributions throughout the growth.
Owing to the ruthenium component which has a limited carbon solubility, tubes
grow in tangential mode and their diameter is close to that of their seeding
nanoparticle. By using as-synthesized SWCNTs as a channel material in field
effect transistors, we show how the chemical composition of the catalysts and
temperature can be used as parameters to tune the diameter distribution and
semiconducting-to-metallic ratio of SWCNT samples. Finally, a phenomenological
model, based on the dependence of the carbon solubility as a function of
catalyst nanoparticle size and nature of the alloying elements, is proposed to
interpret the results.

obtained in the past for a wide variety of mathematical models for infectious
disease spread, along with expressions for the expected final size of an
outbreak. However, what has so far not been studied is the average number of
infections that descend down the chains of infection begun by each of the
individuals infected in an outbreak (we refer to this quantity as the ""average
number of descendant infections"" per infectious individual, or ANDI). ANDI
includes not only the number of people that an individual directly contacts and
infects, but also the number of people that those go on to infect, and so on
until that particular chain of infection dies out. Quantification of ANDI has
relevance to the vaccination debate, since with ANDI one can calculate the
probability that one or more people are hospitalised (or die) from a disease
down an average chain of infection descending from an infected un-vaccinated
individual. Here we obtain estimates of ANDI using both deterministic and
stochastic modelling formalisms. With both formalisms we find that even for
relatively small community sizes and under most scenarios for R0 and initial
fraction vaccinated, ANDI can be surprisingly large when the effective
reproduction number is >1, leading to high probabilities of adverse outcomes
for one or more people down an average chain of infection in outbreaks of
diseases like measles.

tilts the moving domain wall (DW) plane, and the mechanism for this tilting is
not quite clear. In this work, we have found that this tilting may be
understood based on a micromagnetic calculation from a microscopic dynamical
perspective. The DMI-induced antisymmetric moment structure at the two
boundaries of the track needs to be paid attention. In the early stage of CIDWM
induced by spin-orbit torque, this antisymmetry is destroyed. Afterwards, the
moments at the two boundaries experience distinct rotation processes with
different energy paths towards their final stable antisymmetric moment
structure. This results in different initial velocities of the local DW regions
at the two boundaries. In mathematics, this distinct DW dynamical progresses at
the two boundaries can be approximately revealed by modifying the initial
conditions for solving the Thiele equations.

networks, votes, or gene expression. In some cases, the analysis of binary
matrices can be tackled with nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), where the
observed data matrix is approximated by the product of two smaller nonnegative
matrices. In this context, probabilistic NMF assumes a generative model where
the data is usually Bernoulli-distributed. Often, a link function is used to
map the factorization to the $[0,1]$ range, ensuring a valid Bernoulli mean
parameter. However, link functions have the potential disadvantage to lead to
uninterpretable models. Mean-parameterized NMF, on the contrary, overcomes this
problem. We propose a unified framework for Bayesian mean-parameterized
nonnegative binary matrix factorization models (NBMF). We analyze three models
which correspond to three possible constraints that respect the
mean-parametrization without the need for link functions. Furthermore, we
derive a novel collapsed Gibbs sampler and a collapsed variational algorithm to
infer the posterior distribution of the factors. Next, we extend the proposed
models to a nonparametric setting where the number of used latent dimensions is
automatically driven by the observed data. We analyze the performance of our
NBMF methods in multiple datasets for different tasks such as dictionary

unital ordered complex topological $*$-algebras with the isomorphism extending
the identity mapping of $M_n(\mathscr{M}) \to M_n(\mathscr{M})$. Consequently,
the algebraic machinery of rank identities and determinant identities are
applicable in this setting. As a step further in the Heisenberg-von Neumann
puzzle discussed by Kadison-Liu (SIGMA, 10 (2014), Paper 009), it follows that
if there exist operators $P, Q$ in $\mathscr{M}_{\textrm{aff}}$ satisfying the
commutation relation $Q \; \hat \cdot \; P \; \hat - \; P \; \hat \cdot \; Q =
{i\mkern1mu} I$, then at least one of them does not belong to $L^p(\mathscr{M},
\tau)$ for any $0 < p \le \infty$. Furthermore, the respective point spectrums
of $P$ and $Q$ must be empty. Hence the puzzle may be recasted in the following
equivalent manner - Are there invertible operators $P, A$ in
$\mathscr{M}_{\textrm{aff}}$ such that $P^{-1} \; \hat \cdot \; A \; \hat \cdot
\; P = I \; \hat + \; A$? This suggests that any strategy towards its
resolution must involve the study of conjugacy invariants of operators in

possible defect structures, and empirical potentials are commonly fitted to or
evaluated with respect to these energies. But recently [Dudarev et al Nuclear
Fusion 2018], we have shown how to determine the stresses, strains and swelling
of reactor components under irradiation from the elastic properties of
ensembles of irradiation-induced defects. These elastic properties have
received comparatively little attention. Here we evaluate relaxation volumes of
irradiation-induced defects in tungsten computed with empirical potentials, and
compare to density functional theory results where available. Different
empirical potentials give different results, but some potential-independent
trends in relaxation volumes can be identified. We show that the relaxation
volume of small defects can be predicted to within 10% from their point-defect
count. For larger defects we provide empirical fits for the relaxation volume
of as a function of size. We demonstrate that the relaxation volume associated
with a single primary-damage cascade can be estimated from the primary knock-on
atom (PKA) energy. We conclude that while annihilation of vacancy- and
interstitial- character defects will invariably reduce the total relaxation
volume of the cascade debris, empirical potentials disagree whether coalescence
of defects will reduce or increase the total relaxation volume.

also provide a plausible alternative explanation for a range of observations.
Although a number of explanations have been proposed for the origin of the
superdisks, little is known about their material content. Some X-ray
observations of superdisk candidates indicate the presence of hot gas, but a
cool dusty medium also seems to be common in them. If they are made of entirely
or partly neutral gas, it may be directly detectable and we report here a first
attempt to detect/image any neutral hydrogen gas present in the superdisks that
are inferred to be present in four nearby radio galaxies. We have not found a
positive HI signal in any of the four sources, resulting in tight upper limits
on the HI number density in the postulated superdisks, estimated directly from
the central rms noise values of the final radio continuum subtracted image. The
estimated ranges of the upper limit on neutral hydrogen number density and
column density are $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ atoms per cm$^3$ and $10^{19}-10^{20}$
atoms per cm$^{2}$, respectively. No positive HI signal is detected even after
combining all the four available HI images (with inverse variance weighting).
This clearly rules out an HI dominated superdisk as a viable model to explain

sequence of estimated nested models containing $0, \ldots, T-1$ change-points,
where $T$ is the data length. The other ingredient is a new model selection
procedure, referred to as ""Steepest Drop to Low Levels"" (SDLL). The SDLL
criterion acts on the WBS2 solution path, and, unlike many existing model
selection procedures for change-point problems, it is not penalty-based, and
only uses thresholding as a certain discrete secondary check. The resulting
WBS2.SDLL procedure, combining both ingredients, is shown to be consistent, and
to significantly outperform the competition in the frequent change-point
scenarios tested. WBS2.SDLL is fast, easy to code and does not require the

studying the thermodynamic properties of different ion species. However, most
in-situ observations of positive ions in the solar wind are taken at 1 AU,
where information on their solar source properties may have been irreversibly
erased. In this study we aimed to use the properties of alpha particles at
heliocentric distances between 0.3 and 1 AU to study plasma processes occurring
at the points of observation, and to infer processes occurring inside 0.3 AU by
comparing our results to previous remote sensing observations of the plasma
closer to the Sun. We reprocessed the original Helios positive ion distribution
functions, isolated the alpha particle population, and computed the alpha
particle number density, velocity, and magnetic field perpendicular and
parallel temperatures. We then investigated the radial variation of alpha
particle temperatures in fast solar wind observed between 0.3 and 1 AU. Between
0.3 and 1 AU alpha particles are heated in the magnetic field perpendicular
direction, and cooled in the magnetic field parallel direction. Alpha particle
evolution is bounded by the alpha firehose instability threshold, which
provides one possible mechanism to explain the observed parallel cooling and
perpendicular heating. Closer to the Sun our observations suggest that the
alpha particles undergo heating the perpendicular direction, whilst the large
magnetic field parallel temperatures observed at 0.3 AU may be due the combined
effect of double adiabatic expansion and alpha particle deceleration inside 0.3
AU.

technique by which a set of wireless access points are synchronized and grouped
together to jointly serve multiple users simultaneously. This paper addresses
two dynamic resource management problems pertaining to D-MIMO Wi-Fi networks:
(i) channel assignment of D-MIMO groups, and (ii) deciding how to cluster
access points to form D-MIMO groups, in order to maximize user throughput

achieving an improvement of 20% in user throughput performance compared to
heuristic solutions, particularly when network conditions are dynamic. This

applications to model the associations between multiple related responses and a
set of predictors. To infer such associations, it is often of interest to test
the structure of the regression coefficients matrix, and the likelihood ratio
test (LRT) is one of the most popular approaches in practice. Despite its
popularity, it is known that the classical $\chi^2$ approximations for LRTs
often fail in high-dimensional settings, where the dimensions of responses and
predictors $(m,p)$ are allowed to grow with the sample size $n$. Though various
corrected LRTs and other test statistics have been proposed in the literature,
the fundamental question of when the classic LRT starts to fail is less
studied, an answer to which would provide insights for practitioners,
especially when analyzing data with $m/n$ and $p/n$ small but not negligible.
Moreover, the power performance of the LRT in high-dimensional data analysis
remains underexplored. To address these issues, the first part of this work
gives the asymptotic boundary where the classical LRT fails and develops the
corrected limiting distribution of the LRT for a general asymptotic regime. The
second part of this work further studies the test power of the LRT in the
high-dimensional setting. The result not only advances the current
understanding of asymptotic behavior of the LRT under alternative hypothesis,
but also motivates the development of a power-enhanced LRT. The third part of
this work considers the setting with $p>n$, where the LRT is not well-defined.
We propose a two-step testing procedure by first performing dimension reduction
and then applying the proposed LRT. Theoretical properties are developed to
ensure the validity of the proposed method. Numerical studies are also
presented to demonstrate its good performance.

exponentiation of Cachazo-Strominger soft factors, acting on massive
higher-spin amplitudes, can be used to find spin contributions to the
aligned-spin scattering angle, conjecturally extending previously known results
to higher orders in spin at one-loop order. The extraction of the classical
limit is accomplished via the on-shell leading-singularity method and using
massive spinor-helicity variables. The three-point amplitude for arbitrary-spin
massive particles minimally coupled to gravity is expressed in an exponential
form, and in the infinite-spin limit it matches the effective stress-energy
tensor of the linearized Kerr solution. A four-point gravitational Compton
amplitude is obtained from an extrapolated soft theorem, equivalent to gluing
two exponential three-point amplitudes, and becomes itself an exponential
operator. The construction uses these amplitudes to: 1) recover the known
tree-level scattering angle at all orders in spin, 2) recover the known
one-loop linear-in-spin interaction, 3) match a previous conjectural expression
for the one-loop scattering angle at quadratic order in spin, 4) propose new
one-loop results through quartic order in spin. These connections link the
computation of higher-multipole interactions to the study of deeper orders in

the execution performance of such a job, it is crucial to reduce the completion
time of a coflow which can contribute more than 50% of the job completion time.
While several schedulers have been proposed, we observe that routing, as a
factor greatly impacting the Coflow Completion Time (CCT), has not been well
considered. In this paper, we focus on the coflow scheduling problem and
jointly consider routing and bandwidth allocation. We first provide an
analytical solution to the problem of optimal bandwidth allocation with
pre-determined routes. We then formulate the coflow scheduling problem as a
Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming problem and present its relaxed convex
optimization problem. We further propose two algorithms, CoRBA and its
simplified version: CoRBA-fast, that jointly perform routing and bandwidth
allocation for a given coflow while minimizes the CCT. Through both offline and
online simulations, we demonstrate that CoRBA reduces the CCT by 40%-500%
compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. Simulation results also show that
CoRBA-fast can be tens of times faster than all other algorithms with around
10% performance degradation compared to CoRBA, which makes the use of
CoRBA-fast very applicable in practice.

number of methods proposed and the significant progresses reported in the last
decade, conditioning reservoir models to dynamic data is still a challenging
task. Ensemble-based methods are among the most successful and efficient
techniques currently available for history matching. These methods are usually
able to achieve reasonable data matches, especially if an iterative formulation
is employed. However, they sometimes fail to preserve the geological realism of
the model, which is particularly evident in reservoir with complex facies
distributions. This occurs mainly because of the Gaussian assumptions inherent
in these methods. This fact has encouraged an intense research activity to
develop parameterizations for facies history matching. Despite the large number
of publications, the development of robust parameterizations for facies remains
an open problem.
  Deep learning techniques have been delivering impressive results in a number
of different areas and the first applications in data assimilation in
geoscience have started to appear in literature. The present paper reports the
current results of our investigations on the use of deep neural networks
towards the construction of a continuous parameterization of facies which can
be used for data assimilation with ensemble methods. Specifically, we use a
convolutional variational autoencoder and the ensemble smoother with multiple
data assimilation. We tested the parameterization in three synthetic
history-matching problems with channelized facies. We focus on this type of
facies because they are among the most challenging to preserve after the
assimilation of data. The parameterization showed promising results
outperforming previous methods and generating well-defined channelized facies.

  entropy evolution and the Nyquist-Shannon theorem","Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aaf8a7",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The time irreversibility and fast relaxation of collapsing $N$-body
gravitating systems (as opposed to the time reversibility of the equations of
motion for individual stars or particles) are traditionally attributed to
information loss due to coarse-graining in the observation. We show that this
subjective element is not necessary once one takes into consideration the
fundamental fact that these systems are discrete, i.e. composed of a finite
number $N$ of stars or particles. We show that a connection can be made between
entropy estimates for discrete systems and the Nyquist-Shannon sampling
criterion. Specifically, given a sample with $N$ points in a space of $d$
dimensions, the Nyquist-Shannon criterion constrains the size of the smallest
structures defined by a function in the continuum that can be uniquely
associated with the discrete sample. When applied to an $N$-body system, this
theorem sets a lower limit to the size of phase-space structures (in the
continuum) that can be resolved in the discrete data. As a consequence, the
finite $N$ system tends to a uniform distribution after a relaxation time that
typically scales as $N^{1/d}$. This provides an explanation for the fast
achievement of a stationary state in collapsing $N$-body gravitating systems
such as galaxies and star clusters, without the need to advocate for the
subjective effect of coarse-graining.

such SCI wave functions are not eigenfunctions of the $S^2$ operator. In many
situations (bond breaking, magnetic system, excited state, etc), having a
spin-adapted wave function is essential for a quantitatively correct
description of the system. Here, we propose an efficient algorithm which, given
an arbitrary determinant space, generates all the missing Slater determinants
allowing one to obtain spin-adapted wave functions while avoiding manipulations
involving configuration state functions. For example, generating all the
possible determinants with 6 spin-up and 6 spin-down electrons in 12 open

still done with individual determinants, and one can take advantage of the

different contributions, by observing that predominant surface electrical
conduction produces linear frequency dependence of the pickup signal while bulk
conductivity gives rise to quadratic frequency dependence. We also see an
algebraic temperature dependent surface conductivity while an activated bulk
conductivity. Using the above we uncover an interplay between surface and bulk
contribution to electrical conductivity in the TI as a function of

dominated electrical transport is found to occur close to 70 K. This
temperature range matches well with our results from activated bulk electrical
transport results which shows an activation energy scale, delta which is in the
millieV range. The gap delta is much less than the bulk band gap in Bi2Se3, and
which we argue is associated with defect states in the TI material. To
understand our results, we propose a model of a TI comprising of an

Gaussian random field and ellipticity correlation functions that are
conditional on the environment of the galaxies are constructed by sampling
random values for the tidal tensor and inertial tensor. The covariance of the
Gaussian random process from which the tensor entries are drawn is decomposed
by means of a spherical Fourier-Bessel transformation of the density field. The
dependence on environment is modelled by the number of positive eigenvalues of
the tidal tensor, which allows a differentiation between voids, sheets,
filaments and superclusters. We find that elliptical galaxies align strongest
in elongated structures such as sheets and filaments with an amplitude almost
an order of magnitude higher compared to the alignment in clusters or voids. In
contrast to this, spiral galaxies align equally strong in all environments.
Cross-alignments between different environments are smaller than the respective
auto-correlations subject to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality which is an
effective bound on their amplitude. Furthermore, we find misalignment between
inertial and tidal tensor to be stronger in anisotropic regions compared to
clusters or voids. While the imprint of weak lensing on galaxy ellipticities is
agnostic about the environment, using environment information can help to
distinguish between lensing and the intrinsic alignment signal.

larger than the membrane time constant of individual neurons. Two types of
mechanisms have been proposed to explain this conundrum. One possibility is
that large timescales are generated by a network mechanism based on positive
feedback, but this hypothesis requires fine-tuning of the synaptic connections.
A second possibility is that large timescales in the neural dynamics are
inherited from large timescales of underlying biophysical processes, two
prominent candidates being adaptive ionic currents and synaptic transmission.
How the timescales of these processes influence the timescale of the network
dynamics has however not been fully explored. To address this question, we
analyze large networks of randomly connected excitatory and inhibitory units
with additional degrees of freedom that correspond to adaptation or synaptic
filtering. We determine the fixed points of the systems, their stability to
perturbations and the corresponding dynamical timescales. Furthermore, we apply
dynamical mean field theory to study the temporal statistics of the activity in
the fluctuating regime, and examine how the adaptation and synaptic timescales
transfer from individual units to the whole population. Our overarching finding
is that synaptic filtering and adaptation in single neurons have very different
effects at the network level. Unexpectedly, the macroscopic network dynamics do
not inherit the large timescale present in adaptive currents. In contrast, the
timescales of network activity increase proportionally to the time constant of
the synaptic filter. Altogether, our study demonstrates that the timescales of
different biophysical processes have different effects on the network level, so
that the slow processes within individual neurons do not necessarily induce
slow activity in large recurrent neural networks.

control in wireless networks. The proposed method is a new branch-and-bound
procedure based on problem-specific bounds for energy-efficiency maximization
that allow for faster convergence. This enables to find the global solution for
all of the most common energy-efficient power control problems with a
complexity that, although still exponential in the number of variables, is much
lower than other available global optimization frameworks. Moreover, the
reduced complexity of the proposed framework allows its practical
implementation through the use of deep neural networks. Specifically, thanks to
its reduced complexity, the proposed method can be used to train an artificial
neural network to predict the optimal resource allocation. This is in contrast
with other power control methods based on deep learning, which train the neural
network based on suboptimal power allocations due to the large complexity that
generating large training sets of optimal power allocations would have with
available global optimization methods. As a benchmark, we also develop a novel
first-order optimal power allocation algorithm. Numerical results show that a
neural network can be trained to predict the optimal power allocation policy.

However, due to correlations in the LSS, cosmological observables are dependent
on the position of an observer. We investigate this influence in full
generality for a weakly non-Gaussian random field, for which we derive
expressions for angular spectra of large-scale structure observables
conditional on a property of the large-scale structure that is typical for the
observer's location. As an application, we then apply to the formalism to
angular spectra of the weak gravitational lensing effect and provide numerical
estimates for the resulting change on the spectra using linear structure
formation. For angular weak lensing spectra we find the effect to be of order
of a few percent, for instance we estimate for an overdensity of $\delta =0.5$
and multipoles up to $\ell=100$ the change in the weak lensing spectra to be
approximately 4 percent. We show that without accounting for correlation
between the density at observer's location and the weak gravitational lensing
spectra, the values of the parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ are
underestimated by a few percent. Thus, this effect will be important when
analysing data from future surveys such as Euclid, which aim at the
percent-level precision. The effect is difficult to capture in simulations, as
estimates of the number of numerical simulations necessary to quantify the
effect are high.

dynamics, nodes in realistic highly connected networks, such as neurons in the
brain, exhibit intrinsic dynamics over multiple timescales. We analyze how the
dynamical properties of nodes (such as single neurons) and recurrent
connections interact to shape the effective dynamics in large randomly
connected networks. A novel dynamical mean-field theory for strongly connected
networks of multi-dimensional rate units shows that the power spectrum of the
network activity in the chaotic phase emerges from a nonlinear sharpening of
the frequency response function of single units. For the case of
two-dimensional rate units with strong adaptation, we find that the network
exhibits a state of ""resonant chaos"", characterized by robust, narrow-band
stochastic oscillations. The coherence of stochastic oscillations is maximal at
the onset of chaos and their correlation time scales with the adaptation
timescale of single units. Surprisingly, the resonance frequency can be
predicted from the properties of isolated units, even in the presence of
heterogeneity in the adaptation parameters. In the presence of these
internally-generated chaotic fluctuations, the transmission of weak,
low-frequency signals is strongly enhanced by adaptation, whereas signal
transmission is not influenced by adaptation in the non-chaotic regime. Our
theoretical framework can be applied to other mechanisms at the level of single
nodes, such as synaptic filtering, refractoriness or spike synchronization.
These results advance our understanding of the interaction between the dynamics
of single units and recurrent connectivity, which is a fundamental step toward
the description of biologically realistic network models in the brain, or, more
generally, networks of other physical or man-made complex dynamical units.

Brownian increments. In [13] it was shown that the (thermodynamic) limit
$\lim_{T\to\infty}\widehat{\mathbb P}_{\varepsilon,T}=\widehat{\mathbb

was identified explicitly as a mixture of Gaussian processes. In the present
article, the strong coupling limit or the vanishing Kac parameter limit
$\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0} \widehat{\mathbb P}_\varepsilon$ is investigated. It
is shown that this limit exists and coincides with the increments of the Pekar
process, which is a stationary diffusion process with generator $\frac 12

shifts) maximizer of the Pekar variational problem $$ g_0=\sup_{\|\psi\|_2=1}

$$ As shown in [12,6,1], the Pekar process is itself approximated by the
limiting ""mean-field Polaron measures"", and thus, the present identification of
the strong coupling Polaron is a rigorous justification of the ""mean-field
approximation"" (on the level of path measures) conjectured by Spohn in [15].
This approximation in the vanishing Kac limit ($\varepsilon\to 0$) is also
shown to hold for a general class of Kac-Interaction of the form
$H(t,x)=\varepsilon \mathrm e^{-\varepsilon|t|} V(x)$ where $V$ is any
continuous function vanishing at infinity.

quantities that characterize the conditions of ionized HII regions --
metallicity ($Z$), ionization parameter ($U$), and electron density
($n_\mathrm{e}$) -- and the global stellar mass ($M_\ast$) and specific star
formation rate ($\mathrm{sSFR}=\mathrm{SFR}/M_\ast$) of the host galaxies. We
construct composite spectra of galaxies at $0.027 \le z \le 0.25$ from Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, separating the sample into bins of $M_\ast$ and sSFR, and
estimate the nebular conditions from the emission line flux ratios. Specially,
metallicity is estimated from the direct method based on the faint auroral
lines [OIII]$\lambda$4363 and [OII]$\lambda\lambda$7320,7330. The metallicity
estimates cover a wide range from $12+\log\mathrm{O/H}\sim7.6\textrm{--}8.9$.
It is found that these three nebular parameters all are tightly correlated with
the location in the $M_\ast$--sSFR plane. With simple physically-motivated
ans\""atze, we derive scaling relations between these physical quantities by
performing multi regression analysis. In particular, we find that $U$ is
primarily controlled by sSFR, as $U \propto \mathrm{sSFR}^{0.43}$, but also
depends significantly on both $Z$ and $n_\mathrm{e}$. The derived partial
dependence of $U \propto Z^{-0.36}$ is weaker than the apparent correlation
($U\propto Z^{-1.52}$). The remaining negative dependence of $U$ on
$n_\mathrm{e}$ is found to be $U \propto n_\mathrm{e}^{-0.29}$. The scaling

defy classical explanation in the sense of requiring contextuality [M. F.
Pusey, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 200401, arXiv:1409.1535]. Here we elaborate on and
extend that result in several directions. Firstly, the original theorem
requires certain perfect correlations that can never be realised in any actual
experiment. Hence, we provide new theorems that allow for a noise-robust
experimental verification of contextuality from anomalous weak values, and
compare with a recent experiment. Secondly, the original theorem connects the
anomaly to contextuality only in the presence of a whole set of extra
operational constraints. Here we clarify the debate surrounding anomalous weak
values by showing that these conditions are tight -- if any one of them is
dropped, the anomaly can be reproduced classically. Thirdly, whereas the
original result required the real part of the weak value to be anomalous, we
also give a version for any weak value with nonzero imaginary part. Finally, we
show that similar results hold if the weak measurement is performed through
qubit pointers, rather than the traditional continuous system. In summary, we
provide inequalities for witnessing nonclassicality using experimentally
realistic measurements of any anomalous weak value, and clarify what
ingredients of the quantum experiment must be missing in any classical model
that can reproduce the anomaly.

data have the same distribution, while this assumption does not necessarily
hold in real applications. Domain adaptation methods take into account the
deviations in the data distribution. In this work, we study the problem of
domain adaptation on graphs. We consider a source graph and a target graph
constructed with samples drawn from data manifolds. We study the problem of
estimating the unknown class labels on the target graph using the label
information on the source graph and the similarity between the two graphs. We
particularly focus on a setting where the target label function is learnt such
that its spectrum is similar to that of the source label function. We first
propose a theoretical analysis of domain adaptation on graphs and present
performance bounds that characterize the target classification error in terms
of the properties of the graphs and the data manifolds. We show that the
classification performance improves as the topologies of the graphs get more
balanced, i.e., as the numbers of neighbors of different graph nodes become
more proportionate, and weak edges with small weights are avoided. Our results
also suggest that graph edges between too distant data samples should be
avoided for good generalization performance. We then propose a graph domain
adaptation algorithm inspired by our theoretical findings, which estimates the
label functions while learning the source and target graph topologies at the
same time. The joint graph learning and label estimation problem is formulated
through an objective function relying on our performance bounds, which is
minimized with an alternating optimization scheme. Experiments on synthetic and
real data sets suggest that the proposed method outperforms baseline
approaches.

compares to some of the brightest Seyferts, but it has been poorly studied in
comparison. We find that the X-ray (0.3-10.0 keV) and the UVM2 (roughly
2000--2500 Angstrom) fluxes have fractional variability amplitudes of 0.35 and
0.18, respectively, over the entire monitoring period (2017 Jan. 2 to 2018 Apr.

Especially given that reverberation studies have found significant lags between

significant X-ray-UV correlation may point to additional complexities in the
inner or intermediate disk. Mechanical (e.g.,a funnel in the inner disk) and/or
relativistic beaming of the X-ray emission could potentially explain the lack
of a correlation. Alternatively, scattering in an equatorial wind could also
diminish the ability of more isotropic X-ray emission to heat the disk itself.

experiments with the PHAZER chamber to simulate haze formation in a range of

destruction of the initial gas and the formation of new gas species) during

chemical processes happen in the experiments as a function of different initial
gas mixture and different energy sources (plasma or UV photons). We find that
organic gas products and O2 are photochemically generated in the experiments,
demonstrating that photochemical production is one of the abiotic sources for
these potential biosignatures. Multiple simulated atmospheres produce organics

constituents that emerge at a critical point. This mechanism has been
extensively explored for classical and quantum systems in equilibrium, whose
critical behavior is described by a general theory of phase transitions.
Recently, however, fundamentally distinct phase transitions have been
discovered for out-of-equilibrium quantum systems, which can exhibit critical
behavior that defies this description and is not well understood. A
paradigmatic example is the many-body-localization (MBL) transition, which
marks the breakdown of quantum thermalization. Characterizing quantum critical
behavior in an MBL system requires the measurement of its entanglement
properties over space and time, which has proven experimentally challenging due
to stringent requirements on quantum state preparation and system isolation.
Here, we observe quantum critical behavior at the MBL transition in a
disordered Bose-Hubbard system and characterize its entanglement properties via
its quantum correlations. We observe strong correlations, whose emergence is
accompanied by the onset of anomalous diffusive transport throughout the
system, and verify their critical nature by measuring their system-size
dependence. The correlations extend to high orders in the quantum critical
regime and appear to form via a sparse network of many-body resonances that
spans the entire system. Our results unify the system's microscopic structure
with its macroscopic quantum critical behavior, and they provide an essential
step towards understanding criticality and universality in non-equilibrium
systems.

The banking system model consists in an initial value problem for a system of
stochastic differential equations whose dependent variables are the
log-monetary reserves of the banks as functions of time. The banking system
model considered generalizes previous models studied in [5], [4], [7] and
describes an homogeneous population of banks. Two distinct mechanisms are used
to model the cooperation among banks and the cooperation between banks and
monetary authority. These mechanisms are regulated respectively by the
parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. A bank fails when its log-monetary reserves
go below an assigned default level. We call systemic risk or systemic event in
a bounded time interval the fact that in that time interval at least a given
fraction of the banks fails. The probability of systemic risk in a bounded time
interval is evaluated using statistical simulation. A method to govern the
probability of systemic risk in a bounded time interval is presented. The goal
of the governance is to keep the probability of systemic risk in a bounded time
interval between two given thresholds. The governance is based on the choice of
the log-monetary reserves of a kind of ""ideal bank"" as a function of time and
on the solution of an optimal control problem for the mean field approximation
of the banking system model. The solution of the optimal control problem
determines the parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ as functions of time, that is
defines the rules of the borrowing and lending activity among banks and between
banks and monetary authority. Some numerical examples are discussed. The
systemic risk governance is tested in absence and in presence of positive and
negative shocks acting on the banking system.

nanoflares places them below the sensitivities of current observational
instrumentation. Here, we employ Monte Carlo techniques to synthesize realistic
nanoflare intensity time series from a dense grid of power-law indices and
decay timescales. Employing statistical techniques, which examine the modeled
intensity fluctuations with more than 10^7 discrete measurements, we show how
it is possible to extract and quantify nanoflare characteristics throughout the
solar atmosphere, even in the presence of significant photon noise. A

of stellar and exoplanetary parameters: i.e., ages, masses, and radii. In the
modern era of asteroseismology, parameters of solar-like stars are derived by
fitting theoretical models to observational data, which include measurements of
their oscillation frequencies, metallicity [Fe/H], and effective temperature
Teff. Combining this information with transit data furthermore yields the
corresponding parameters for their exoplanets. While [Fe/H] and Teff are
commonly stated to a precision of ~0.1 dex and ~100 K, the impact of errors in
their measurement has not been studied in practice within the context of the
parameters derived from them. Here we use the Stellar Parameters in an Instant
(SPI) pipeline to estimate the parameters of nearly 100 stars observed by
Kepler and Gaia, many of which are confirmed planet hosts. We adjust the
reported spectroscopic measurements of these stars by introducing faux
systematic errors and artificially increasing the reported uncertainties, and
quantify the differences in the resulting parameters. We find that a systematic
error of 0.1 dex in [Fe/H] translates to differences of only 4%, 2%, and 1% on
average in the resulting stellar ages, masses, and radii, which are well within
their uncertainties (~11%, 3.5%, 1.4%) as derived by SPI. We also find that
increasing the uncertainty of [Fe/H] measurements by 0.1 dex increases the
uncertainties by only 0.01 Gyr, 0.02 M_sun, and 0.01 R_sun, which are again
well below their reported uncertainties (0.5 Gyr, 0.04 M_sun, 0.02 R_sun). The
results for Teff at 100 K are similar. Stellar parameters from SPI are
unchanged within uncertainties by errors of up to 0.14 dex or 175 K, and are
even more robust to errors in Teff than the seismic scaling relations.
Consequently, the parameters for their exoplanets are robust as well.

stellar-phase metallicities are already compatible with those of local

would be strong evidence for beyond-CDM physics, such as Self-Interacting Dark
Matter (SIDM). An observable consequence would be oscillations of the Brightest
Cluster Galaxy (BCG) in otherwise relaxed galaxy clusters. Offset BCGs have
indeed been observed - but only interpreted via a simplified, analytic model of
oscillations. We compare these observations to the BAHAMAS-SIDM suite of
cosmological simulations, which include SIDM and a fully hydrodynamical
treatment of star formation and feedback. We predict that the median offset of
BCGs increases with the SIDM cross-section, cluster mass and the amount of
stellar mass within 10kpc, while CDM exhibits no trend in mass. Interpolating
between the simulated cross-sections, we find that the observations (of 10
clusters) is consistent with CDM at the ~1.5$\sigma$ level, and prefer
cross-section $\sigma$/m < 0.12(0.39)cm$^2$/g at 68% (95%) confidence level.

bubbles in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the galaxy
cluster MS0735.6+7421 with the Arepo code, and compare our synthetic SZ results
to inferences obtained with popular modelling approaches. We find that cutting
out ellipsoidal bubbles from a double-beta pressure profile only matches the
inner bubble edges in the simulations and fails to account for the emission of
the shock-enhanced pressure cocoon outside the bubbles. This additional
contribution significantly worsens the accuracy of the cut-out method for jets
with small inclinations with respect to the line of sight. Also, the kinetic SZ
effect of the bubbles, a previously neglected contribution, becomes relevant at
these smaller inclinations due to entrainment and mixing of the intracluster
medium with low-density jet material. Fortunately, the different signs of the
kinetic SZ signal in opposite lobes allow modelling this effect. We present an
approximate method to determine the jet inclination, which combines jet power
and lifetime estimates, the stand-off distance between jet head and bow shock,
and the kinetic SZ effect, thereby helping to correctly infer the bubble
contents.

the star formation rate and stellar mass surface densities, i.e. the spatially

integral field unit surveys and imaging of galaxies. EAGLE reproduces the slope
of the local ($z\approx0.1$) rSFMS well, but with a $\approx-0.15$ dex offset,
close to that found for the galaxy-integrated relation. The shape of the rMZR
agrees reasonably well with observations, replicating the characteristic
turnover at high surface density, which we show is due to AGN feedback. The
residuals of the rSFMS and rMZR are negatively (positively) correlated at low
(high) surface density. The rSFMS becomes shallower as the simulation evolves
from $z=2$ to 0.1, a manifestation of inside-out galaxy formation. The shape of
the rMZR also exhibits dramatic evolution, from a convex profile at $z=2$ to
the observed concave profile at $z=0.1$, such that the gas in regions of high
stellar density is more enriched at higher redshift. The redshift independence
of the relationship between the galaxy-wide gas fraction and metallicity in
EAGLE galaxies is not preserved on 1 kpc scales, implying that chemical
evolution is non-local due to the transport of gas and metals within galaxies.

the area of extremal surfaces anchored to the boundary of a dual AdS space. It
is interesting to ask if there is also an information theoretic interpretation
of the areas of non-extremal surfaces that are not necessarily
boundary-anchored. In general, the physics outside such surfaces is associated
to observers restricted to a time-strip in the dual boundary field theory. When
the latter is two-dimensional, it is known that the differential entropy
associated to the strip computes the length of the dual bulk curve, and has an
interpretation in terms of the information cost in Bell pairs of restoring
correlations inaccessible to observers in the strip. A general realization of
this formalism in higher dimensions is unknown. We first prove a no-go theorem
eliminating candidate expressions for higher dimensional differential entropy
based on entropic c-theorems. Then we propose a new formula in terms of an
integral of shape derivatives of the entanglement entropy of ball shaped
regions. Our proposal stems from the physical requirement that differential
entropy must be locally finite and conformally invariant. Demanding
cancellation of the well-known UV divergences of entanglement entropy in field
theory guides us to our conjecture, which we test for surfaces in $AdS_4$. Our
results suggest a candidate c-function for field theories in arbitrary

theory. While the effect is expected to be present in single crystals of any
noncentrosymmetric metal, we expect it to be strongest in enantiomorphic Weyl
semimetals. Using the semiclassical kinetic equation approach we present
several mechanisms underlying the gyrotropic Hall effect. Amongst them, the
intrinsic mechanism is determined by the Berry curvature dipole, while
extrinsic impurity-induced processes are related to skew scattering and side
jump phenomena. In general, the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions can be of
similar magnitude. We discuss the gyrotropic Hall effect for all frequencies of
practical interest, from the DC transport limit, to optical frequencies. We
show that for frequencies that are small compared to relevant band splittings,
the trace of the gyrotropic Hall tensor in three-dimensional materials is
proportional to a topological, quantized Berry charge, and therefore is robust
in gyrotropic Weyl systems. This implies that polycrystals of strongly
gyrotropic Weyl semimetals will demonstrate strong current-induced optical
activity, whereas the response vanishes for polycrystalline ordinary metals.
Therefore, the current-induced optical activity can be considered a valuable
tool in identifying the topological nature of a material.

to modulate the sky response through a window function which is implemented in
the image plane, and it is possible to choose a wide variety of window
functions. In the context of the cosmological HI 21-cm signal, this is useful
for masking out the sky signal from specific directions which have strong
residual foregrounds. In the context of the ISM in external galaxies, this is
useful to separately estimate the $C_{\ell}$ of different parts of the galaxy.
The ITGE deals with gridded data, hence it is computationally efficient. It
also calculates the noise bias internally and exactly subtracts this out to
give an unbiased estimate of $C_{\ell}$. We validate the ITGE using realistic
VLA simulations at $1.4 {\rm GHz}$. We have applied the ITGE to estimate the
$C_{\ell}$ of HI 21-cm emission from different regions of the galaxy NGC 628.
We find that the slope of the measured $C_{\ell}$ in the outer region is

ratio of Mandelstam invariants. Applying the Lehmann--Symanzik--Zimmerman
reduction procedure to the known expression of a four-point correlation
function in the fishnet theory, we derive a new representation for this
function that is valid for arbitrary coupling. We use this representation to
find the asymptotic behavior of the double-trace amplitude in the high-energy
limit and to compute the corresponding exact Regge trajectories. We verify that
at weak coupling the expressions obtained are in agreement with an explicit
five-loop calculation.

fragmentation of the dark-electron halos into clumps that vary in size from a

softening on the retrieved two-armed spiral eigenmodes of razor-thin stellar
discs.
  We explore four softening kernels with different degrees of gravity bias, and
with/without compact support (compact in the sense that they yield exactly
Newtonian forces outside the softening kernel). These kernels are applied to
two disc galaxy models with well-known unsoftened unstable modes. We illustrate
quantitatively the importance of a vanishing linear gravity bias to yield
accurate frequency estimates of the unstable modes. As such, Plummer softening,
while very popular amongst simulators, performs poorly in our tests.
  The best results, with excellent agreement between the softened and
unsoftened mode properties, are obtained with softening kernels that have a
reduced gravity bias, obtained by compensating for the sub-Newtonian forces at
small interparticle distances with slightly super-Newtonian forces at radii
near the softening length. We present examples of such kernels that, moreover,
are analytically simple and computationally cheap. Finally, these results light
the way to the construction of softening methods with even smaller gravity
bias, although at the price of increasingly complex kernels.

the phase space of a half-mass Mestel disc can trigger the vigorous growth of
two-armed spiral eigenmodes. Such grooves result from the collisional dynamics
of a disc subject to finite-N shot noise, as swing-amplified noise patterns
push stars towards lower-angular momentum orbits at their inner Lindblad
radius. Supplementing the linear theory with analytical arguments, we show that
the dominant spiral mode is a cavity mode with reflections off the forbidden
region around corotation and off the deepest groove. Other subdominant modes
are identified as groove modes. We provide evidence that the depletion of
near-circular orbits, and not the addition of radial orbits, is the crucial
physical ingredient that causes these new eigenmodes.
  Thus, it is possible for an isolated, linearly stable stellar disc to
spontaneously become linearly unstable via the self-induced formation of
phase-space grooves through finite-N dynamics. These results may help explain
the growth and maintenance of spiral patterns in real disc galaxies.

extract 2D features for each pixel with a series of 2D convolutions; we then
backproject the resulting feature vector to the associated voxel in the 3D

higher accuracy object detection and instance segmentation than

strong CP problem and dark matter. In our model, parity symmetry is conserved
at high energy by introducing a mirror sector with the extra gauge symmetry, $
SU(2)_R \times U(1)_R$. The charges of $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_R$ are assigned to
the mirror fields in the same way as in the SM, but the chiralities of the
mirror fermions are opposite to respect the parity symmetry. The strong CP
problem is resolved, since the mirror quarks are also charged under the
$SU(3)_c$ in the SM. In the minimal setup, the mirror gauge symmetry leads to
stable colored particles which would be inconsistent with the observed data, so
that we introduce two scalars in order to deplete the stable colored particles.
Interestingly, one of the scalars becomes stable because of the gauge symmetry
and therefore can be a good dark matter candidate. We especially study the
phenomenology relevant to the dark matter, i.e. thermal relic density, direct
and indirect searches for the dark matter. The bounds from the LHC experiment
and the Landau pole are also taken into account. As a result, we find that a
limited region is viable: the mirror up quark mass is around [600\,GeV, 3\,TeV]
and the relative mass difference between the dark matter and the mirror up
quark or electron is about ${\cal O}$(1-10\,\%). We also discuss the neutrino
sector and show that the right-handed neutrinos in the mirror sector can
increase the effective number of neutrinos or dark radiation by $0.14$.

isolation, alternately advancing these sub-problems to approximate the
evolution of the complete system. Problems with a single, dominant mass can use
mixed-variable symplectic (MVS) integrators that separate the problem into
Keplerian motion of satellites about the primary, and satellite-satellite
interactions. Here, we examine T+V algorithms where the problem is separated
into kinetic T and potential energy V terms. T+V integrators are typically less
efficient than MVS algorithms. This difference is reduced by using different
step sizes for primary-satellite and satellite-satellite interactions. The T+V
method is improved further using 4th and 6th-order algorithms that include
force gradients and symplectic correctors. We describe three 6th-order
algorithms, containing 2 or 3 force evaluations per step, that are competitive
with MVS in some cases. Round-off errors for T+V integrators can be reduced by
several orders of magnitude, at almost no computational cost, using a simple
modification that keeps track of accumulated changes in the coordinates and
momenta. This makes T+V algorithms desirable for long-term, high-accuracy
calculations.

upon binding to cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)$/$cyclin complexes (e.g.,
Cdk2$/$cyclin A), inhibiting their catalytic activity and causing cell cycle
arrest. However, cell division progresses when stably Cdk2$/$cyclin A-bound p27
is phosphorylated on one or two structurally occluded tyrosine residues
$[$tyrosines 88 (Y88) and 74 (Y74)$]$ and a distal threonine residue
$[$threonine 187 (T187)$]$. These events trigger ubiquitination and degradation
of p27, fully activating Cdk2$/$cyclin A to drive cell division. Using an
integrated approach comprising structural, biochemical, biophysical and
single-molecule fluorescence methods, we show that Cdk2$/$cyclin A-bound p27
samples lowly-populated conformations that dynamically anticipate the
sequential steps of this signaling cascade. ""Dynamic anticipation"" provides
access to the non-receptor tyrosine kinases, BCR-ABL and Src, which
sequentially phosphorylate Y88 and Y74 and promote intra-assembly
phosphorylation (of p27) on distal T187. Tyrosine phosphorylation also
allosterically relieves p27-dependent inhibition of substrate binding to
Cdk2$/$cyclin A, a phenomenon we term ""cross-complex allostery"". Even when
tightly bound to Cdk2$/$cyclin A, intrinsic flexibility enables p27 to
integrate and process signaling inputs, and generate outputs including altered
Cdk2 activity, p27 stability, and, ultimately, cell cycle progression.
Intrinsic dynamics within multi-component assemblies may be a general mechanism
of signaling by regulatory IDPs, which can be subverted in human disease, as
exemplified by hyper-active BCR-ABL and Src in certain cancers.

carrier doping an antiferromagnetic Mott (AFM) insulator. Theoretical proposals
and emerging experimental evidence suggest that this process leads to the
formation of intriguing electronic liquid crystal phases. These phases are
characterized by ordered charge and/or spin density modulations, and thought to
be intimately tied to the subsequent emergence of superconductivity. The most
elusive, insulating charge-stripe crystal phase is predicted to occur when a
small density of holes is doped into the charge-transfer insulator state, and
would provide a missing link between the undoped parent AFM phase and the
mysterious, metallic pseudogap. However, due to experimental challenges, it has
been difficult to observe this phase. Here, we use surface annealing to extend
the accessible doping range in Bi-based cuprates and achieve the lightly-doped
charge-transfer insulating state of a cuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. In this
insulating state with a charge transfer gap at the order of ~1 eV, using
spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we discover a
unidirectional charge-stripe order with a commensurate 4a0 period along the
Cu-O-Cu bond. Importantly, this insulating charge-stripe crystal phase develops
before the onset of the pseudogap and the formation of the Fermi surface. Our
work provides new insights into the microscopic origin of electronic
inhomogeneity in high-Tc cuprates.

interesting question is how ""close"" a random input is to the ""critical"" ones,
like the singular matrices in linear algebra or the polynomials with multiple
roots for Newton's root-finding method. Bounds, sometimes very precise, are
known for the volumes over R or C of such neighborhoods of the varieties of

  This paper deals with the discrete version of this question: over a finite
field, how many points lie in a certain type of neighborhood around a given
variety? A trivial upper bound on this number is (size of the variety) x (size
of a neighborhood of a point). It turns out that this bound is usually
asymptotically tight, including for the singular matrices, polynomials with
multiple roots, and pairs of non-coprime polynomials.
  The interesting question then is: for which varieties does this bound not
hold? We show that these are precisely those that admit a shift, that is, where
one absolutely irreducible component is a shift (translation by a fixed nonzero
point) of another such component. Furthermore, the shift-invariant absolutely
irreducible varieties are characterized as being cylinders over some base
variety.
  Computationally, determining whether a given variety is shift-invariant turns
out to be intractable, namely NP-hard even in simple cases.

difficulties of highly unbalanced problems because it uses integrals over the
interface between regions instead of unbalanced integrals over the regions.
Furthermore, a boundary loss complements regional information. Inspired by
graph-based optimization techniques for computing active-contour flows, we
express a non-symmetric $L_2$ distance on the space of contours as a regional
integral, which avoids completely local differential computations involving
contour points. This yields a boundary loss expressed with the regional softmax
probability outputs of the network, which can be easily combined with standard
regional losses and implemented with any existing deep network architecture for
N-D segmentation. We report comprehensive evaluations and comparisons on
different unbalanced problems, showing that our boundary loss can yield
significant increases in performances while improving training stability. Our

proposed to enhance the efficiency of markets with such type of resources. It
is also the first market design that links a forward market and a spot market
through the coordination of schedule and price under the multi-period paradigm,
achieving reliability, economic efficiency and dispatch-following incentives

intertemporal constraints as a guideline, the spot market model is able to
produce economically efficient dispatch solutions as well as prices that
incentivize dispatch following under the perfect forecast condition. The
proposed scheme is applied to the dispatch and pricing of energy storage

representations of the same space. For example, 3D rotations can be represented
with quaternions or Euler angles. In this paper, we advance a definition of a
continuous representation, which can be helpful for training deep neural
networks. We relate this to topological concepts such as homeomorphism and
embedding. We then investigate what are continuous and discontinuous
representations for 2D, 3D, and n-dimensional rotations. We demonstrate that
for 3D rotations, all representations are discontinuous in the real Euclidean
spaces of four or fewer dimensions. Thus, widely used representations such as
quaternions and Euler angles are discontinuous and difficult for neural
networks to learn. We show that the 3D rotations have continuous
representations in 5D and 6D, which are more suitable for learning. We also
present continuous representations for the general case of the n-dimensional
rotation group SO(n). While our main focus is on rotations, we also show that
our constructions apply to other groups such as the orthogonal group and
similarity transforms. We finally present empirical results, which show that
our continuous rotation representations outperform discontinuous ones for
several practical problems in graphics and vision, including a simple
autoencoder sanity test, a rotation estimator for 3D point clouds, and an
inverse kinematics solver for 3D human poses.

ways in which to solve it within the context of scalar field theory, by
utilising a duality relation between an effective average action and a
Wilsonian effective action. Along the way we also prove a duality relation
between two effective average actions computed with different UV cutoff
profiles. Next we investigate the requirement of background independence within
the derivative expansion of conformally reduced gravity. We show that modified
Ward identities are compatible with the flow equations if and only if either
the anomalous dimension vanishes or the cutoff profile is chosen to be power
law, and furthermore show that no solutions exist if the Ward identities are
incompatible. In the compatible case, a clear reason is found why Ward
identities can still forbid the existence of fixed points. By expanding in
vertices, we also demonstrate that the combined equations generically become
either over-constrained or highly redundant at the six-point level. Finally, we
consider the asymptotic behaviour of fixed point solutions in the $f(R)$
approximation and explain in detail how to construct them. We find that quantum
fluctuations do not decouple at large $R$, typically leading to elaborate
asymptotic solutions containing several free parameters. Depending on the value

generalizes its dynamics to a novel recurrent ANN unit. SNUs bridge the

inclusion of spiking neurons in deep learning architectures. Furthermore, SNU
enables highly-efficient in-memory acceleration of SNNs trained with
backpropagation through time, implemented with the hardware in-the-loop. We
apply SNUs to tasks ranging from hand-written digit recognition, language

variables in a mathematical model. The Sobol' indices, a commonly used tool in
GSA, seek to do this by attributing to each variable its relative contribution
to the variance of the model output. In order to compute Sobol' indices, the
user must specify a probability distribution for the uncertain variables. This
distribution is typically unknown and must be chosen using limited data and/or
knowledge. The usefulness of the Sobol' indices depends on their robustness to
this distributional uncertainty. This article presents a novel method which
uses ""optimal perturbations"" of the marginal probability density functions to
analyze the robustness of the Sobol' indices. The method is illustrated through
synthetic examples and a model for contaminant transport.

modes, axionic strings carry a set of worldsheet axions transforming as an
antisymmetric tensor under the group of transverse rotations. We initiate a
study of integrable axionic strings at general number of space-time dimensions
$D$. We show that in the infinite tension limit worldsheet axions should be
described by a peculiar ""pseudofree"" theory---their $S$-matrix is trivial, but
the corresponding action cannot be brought into a free form by a local field
redefinition. This requirement fixes the axionic action to take a form of the
$O(D-2)$ Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) model.

distributed agents coordinating their activity via interaction with a shared
environment. The traditional explanation for how this coordination occurs
focuses on the idea of a ""cement pheromone"", a chemical signal left with
deposited soil that triggers further deposition. Recent research has called
this idea into question, pointing to a more complicated behavioral response to
cues perceived with multiple senses. In this work, we explored the role of
topological cues in affecting early construction activity in Macrotermes. We
created artificial surfaces with a known range of curvatures, coated them with
nest soil, placed groups of major workers on them, and evaluated soil
displacement as a function of location at the end of one hour. Each point on
the surface has a given curvature, inclination, and absolute height; to
disambiguate these factors, we conducted experiments with the surface in
different orientations. Soil displacement activity is consistently correlated
with surface curvature, and not with inclination nor height. Early exploration
activity is also correlated with curvature, to a lesser degree. Topographical
cues provide a long-term physical memory of building activity in a manner that
ephemeral pheromone labeling cannot. Elucidating the roles of these and other
cues for group coordination may help provide organizing principles for swarm
robotics and other artificial systems.

of the outbursts are determined with high accuracy from the light curve of the
nuclear condensation before it disappeared following the second outburst. While
the brightness of the condensation was declining precipitously, the total
brightness continued to grow in the STEREO-A's HI1 images until two days before
perihelion. The red magnitudes measured in these images refer to a uniform
cloud of nuclear fragments, 2200 km^2 in projected area, that began to expand
at a rate of 76 m s^(-1) at the time of the second outburst. A tail extension,
detected in some STEREO-A images, consisted of dust released far from the Sun.
Orbital analysis of the ground-based observations shows that the comet had
arrived from the Oort Cloud in a gravitational orbit. Treating positional
residuals as offsets of a companion of a split comet, we confirm the existence
of the cloud of radiation-pressure driven millimeter-sized dust grains
emanating from the nucleus during the second outburst. We detect a similar, but
compact and much fainter cloud (or a sizable fluffy dust aggregate fragment)

Halpha emission, we study the slope of the Main Sequence (MS) of local star
forming galaxies at stellar masses larger than 10^{10} M_{\odot}. The slope of
the relation strongly depends on the SFR indicator used. In all cases, the
local MS shows a bending at high stellar masses with respect to the slope
obtained in the low mass regime. While the distribution of galaxies in the
upper envelope of the MS is consistent with a log-normal distribution, the
lower envelope shows an excess of galaxies, which increases as a function of
the stellar mass but varies as a function of the SFR indicator used. The
scatter of the best log-normal distribution increases with stellar mass from
~0.3 dex at 10^{10} M_{\odot} to ~0.45 at 10^{11} M_{\odot}. The MS high-mass
end is dominated by central galaxies of group sized halos with a red bulge and
a disk redder than the lower mass counterparts. We argue that the MS bending in
this region is due to two processes: i) the formation of a bulge component as a
consequence of the increased merger activity in groups, and ii) the cold gas
starvation induced by the hot halo environment, which cuts off the gas inflow
onto the disk. Similarly, the increase of the MS scatter at high stellar masses
would be explained by the larger spread of star formation histories of central
group and cluster galaxies with respect to lower mass systems.

development of efficient designs of systems, whose operation is based on solar
energy. This paper presents a methodology to estimate solar irradiance using an
empiric-stochastic approach, which consists of the computation of normalization
parameters from solar irradiance data. For this study, solar irradiance data
was collected with a weather station during a year. Post-treatment included a
trimmed moving average, to smooth the data, the performance a fitting procedure
using a simple model, to recover normalization parameters, and the estimation
of a probability density map by means of a kernel density estimation method.
The normalization parameters and the probability density map allowed us to
build an empiric-stochastic methodology that generates an estimate of the solar
irradiance. In order to validate our method, simulated solar irradiance has
been used to compute the theoretical generation of solar power, which in turn
has been compared to experimental data, retrieved from a commercial
photovoltaic system. Since the simulation results show a good agreement has
been with the experimental data, this simple methodology can estimate the solar
power production and may help consumers to design and test a photovoltaic
system before installation.

to minimize the probability of constraints violation subject to deterministic
convex constraints (which includes a bound on the objective function value). We
adapt existing smoothing-based approaches for chance-constrained problems to

This
class of games can be seen as an extension of parity games, and they have

Calude, Jain, Khoussainov, Li, and Stephan constructed in 2017 a
quasipolynomial time algorithm for solving parity games, which was quickly
followed by two other algorithms with the same complexity. Our objective is to
investigate how these techniques can be extended to the study of mean payoff
games.
  The starting point is the notion of separating automata, which has been used
to present all three quasipolynomial time algorithms for parity games and gives
the best complexity to date. The notion naturally extends to mean payoff games
and yields a class of algorithms for solving mean payoff games. The
contribution of this paper is to prove tight bounds on the complexity of
algorithms in this class. We construct two new algorithms for solving mean
payoff games. Our first algorithm depends on the largest weight $N$ (in
absolute value) appearing in the graph and runs in sublinear time in $N$,
improving over the previously known linear dependence in $N$. Our second
algorithm runs in polynomial time for a fixed number $k$ of weights.
  We complement our upper bounds by providing in both cases almost matching
lower bounds, showing the limitations of the separating automata approach. We
show that we cannot hope to improve on the dependence in $N$ nor break the
linear dependence in the exponent in the number $k$ of weights. In particular,
this shows that separating automata do not yield a quasipolynomial algorithm
for solving mean payoff games.

is the Entropy impurity.
  We study the problem of clustering based on impurity measures. Let $V$ be a

Given $V$ and an impurity measure $I$, the goal is to find a partition

when people access and use information, and is having a profound impact on how
users address their daily information needs. Smart phones are rapidly becoming
our main method of accessing information and are frequently used to perform
`on-the-go' search tasks. As research into information retrieval continues to
evolve, evaluating search behaviour in context is relatively new. Previous
research has studied the effects of context through either self-reported diary
studies or quantitative log analysis; however, neither approach is able to
accurately capture context of use at the time of searching. In this study, we
aim to gain a better understanding of task relevance and search behaviour via a
task-based user study (n=31) employing a bespoke Android app. The app allowed
us to accurately capture the user's context when completing tasks at different
times of the day over the period of a week. Through analysis of the collected
data, we gain a better understanding of how using smart phones on the go
impacts search behaviour, search performance and task relevance and whether or
not the actual context is an important factor.

codes, wherein raw data is arranged in the form of block-wise matrix and each
row and column BCH codes intersect on one data block. We first devise efficient
BCH decoding algorithms, including reduced-1-bit decoding, extra-1-bit list
decoding, and extra-2-bit list decoding. We next present a systematic
construction of BWP-BCH codes upon given message and parity lengths that takes
into account for performance, implementation and scalability, rather than
focusing on a regularly defined BWP-BCH code. It can easily accommodate
different message length or parity length at minimal changes. It employs
extended BCH codes instead of BCH codes to reduce miscorrection rate and an
inner RS code to lower error floor. We also describe a high-speed scalable
encoder. We finally present a novel iterative decoding algorithm which is
divided into three phases. The first phase iteratively applies reduced BCH
correction capabilities to correct lightly corrupted rows/columns while
suppressing miscorrection, until the process stalls. The second phase
iteratively decodes up to the designed correction capabilities, until the
process stalls. The last phase iteratively applies the proposed list decoding
in a novel manner which effectively determines the correct candidate. The key
idea is to use cross decoding upon each list candidate to pick the candidate
which enables the maximum number of successful cross decoding. Our simulations
show that the proposed algorithm provides a significant performance boost
compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.

formalism, we construct a manifold whose points represent all possible initial
conditions for an inflationary theory. After equipping this manifold with a
natural metric, we show that the total volume of this manifold is finite for a
wide class of inflationary potentials. Hence, we identify a natural measure
that enables us to distinguish between generic and finely tuned sets of initial
conditions without the need for a regulator, in contrast to previous work in
the literature. Using this measure, we find that the initial conditions that
allow for sufficient inflation are indeed finely tuned. The degree of
fine-tuning also depends crucially on the value of the cosmological constant at
the time of inflation. Examining the example potential
$V=\lambda\varphi^4+\Lambda$, we find that we require percent-level fine tuning

the unique kinematics of e-e scattering in massless Dirac systems. Here, we use
optoelectronic probes, which are highly sensitive to the kinematics of electron
scattering, to uncover a giant intrinsic photocurrent response in pristine
graphene. This photocurrent emerges exclusively at the charge neutrality point
and vanishes abruptly at non-zero charge densities. Moreover, it is observed at
places with broken reflection symmetry, and it is selectively enhanced at free
graphene edges with sharp bends. Our findings reveal that the photocurrent
relaxation is strongly suppressed by a drastic change of fast photocarrier
kinematics in graphene when its Fermi level matches the Dirac point. The
emergence of robust photocurrents in neutral Dirac materials promises new
energy-harvesting functionalities and highlights intriguing electron dynamics
in the optoelectronic response of Dirac fluids.

different inertial frames, notably the plasma rest frame ${\cal K}$ and the

$\beta_{\rm s}$. The effect of a Lorentz transformation on both subluminal,

preferred choice for a relativistically streaming distribution should be a
Lorentz-transformed J\""uttner distribution; such a distribution is compared

distribution. A Lorentz transformation of the dielectric tensor is written
down, and used to derive an explicit relation between the relativistic plasma

correspondence between wave modes in any two inertial frames. Although there

streaming highly relativistically with a large spread in Lorentz factors in its
rest frame) is discussed, motivated by interest in beam-driven wave turbulence
and the pulsar radio emission mechanism. In the rest frame of the pulsar plasma
there are three wave modes in the low-frequency, non-gyrotropic approximation.
For parallel propagation these are referred to as the X, A and L modes, with
the X and A modes having dispersion relation $z=z_A\approx1-1/2\beta_A^2$,
where $z=\omega/k_\parallel c$ is the phase speed and $\beta_Ac$ is the Alfven
speed. The L mode dispersion relation is determined by a relativistic plasma
dispersion function, $z^2W(z)$, which is negative for $ z < z_0 $ and has a
sharp maximum at $z=z_m$, with $1-z_m<1-z_0\ll1$. We give numerical estimates
for the maximum of $z^2W(z)$ and for $z_m$ and $z_0$ for a 1D Juttner
distribution. The L and A modes reconnect, for $z_A>z_0$, to form the O and
Alfven modes for oblique propagation ($\theta\neq0$). For $z_A<z_0$ the Alfven
and O~mode curves reconnect forming a new mode that exists only for
$\tan^2\theta>z_0^2-z_A^2$.
  The L mode is the nearest counterpart to Langmuir waves in a nonrelativistic
plasma, but we argue that there are no `Langmuir-like' waves in pulsar plasma,
identifying three features of the L~mode (dispersion relation, ratio of
electric to total energy and group speed) that are not Langmuir-like. A
beam-driven instability requires a beam speed equal to the phase speed of the
wave. This resonance condition can be satisfied for the O mode, but only for an
implausibly energetic beam and only for a tiny range of angles for the O~mode
around $\theta\approx0$. The resonance is also possible for the Alfven mode but
only near a turnover frequency that has no counterpart for Alfven waves in a
nonrelativistic plasma.

together with high availability and performance requirements even in presence
of network partitions. In the context of partitioned data stores, it has been
shown that implicit dependency tracking using timestamps is more efficient than
explicit dependency tracking. Existing time-based solutions depend on monotonic
psychical clocks that are closely synchronized. These requirements make current
protocols vulnerable to clock anomalies. In this paper, we propose a new
time-based algorithm, CausalSpartanX, that instead of physical clocks, utilizes
Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLCs). We show that using HLCs, without any overhead, we
make the system robust on physical clock anomalies. This improvement is more
significant in the context of query amplification, where a single query results
in multiple GET/PUT operations. We also show that CausalSpartanX decreases the
visibility latency for a given data item compared with existing time-based
approaches. In turn, this reduces the completion time of collaborative
applications where two clients accessing two different replicas edit same items
of the data store. CausalSpartanX also provides causally consistent distributed
read-only transactions. CausalSpartanX read-only transactions are non-blocking
and require only one round of communication between the client and the servers.
Also, the slowdowns of partitions that are unrelated to a transaction do not
affect the performance of the transaction. Like previous protocols,
CausalSpartanX assumes that a given client does not access more than one
replica. We show that in presence of network partitions, this assumption (made
in several other works) is essential if one were to provide causal consistency
as well as immediate availability to local updates.

service providers and calculated several network structure measures at both
team and individual levels. We considered number of patients' complications as
the target variable and assessed its interrelations with the calculated network
measures along with other influencing factors (e.g. surgical team size, type of
surgery). Our results confirm the significant role of interactions among
surgical providers on patient outcome. In addition, we observed that highly
central providers at the global network level are more likely to be associated
with a lower number of surgical complications, while locally important
providers might be associated with higher number of complications. We also
found a positive relation between age of patients and number of complications.

  Difference-of-Convex (DC) Regularizations",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Under the linear regression framework, we study the variable selection
problem when the underlying model is assumed to have a small number of nonzero
coefficients (i.e., the underlying linear model is sparse). Non-convex
penalties in specific forms are well-studied in the literature for sparse
estimation. A recent work \cite{ahn2016difference} has pointed out that nearly
all existing non-convex penalties can be represented as difference-of-convex
(DC) functions, which can be expressed as the difference of two convex
functions, while itself may not be convex. There is a large existing literature
on the optimization problems when their objectives and/or constraints involve
DC functions. Efficient numerical solutions have been proposed. Under the DC
framework, directional-stationary (d-stationary) solutions are considered, and
they are usually not unique. In this paper, we show that under some mild
conditions, a certain subset of d-stationary solutions in an optimization
problem (with a DC objective) has some ideal statistical properties: namely,
asymptotic estimation consistency, asymptotic model selection consistency,
asymptotic efficiency. The aforementioned properties are the ones that have
been proven by many researchers for a range of proposed non-convex penalties in
the sparse estimation. Our assumptions are either weaker than or comparable
with those conditions that have been adopted in other existing works. This work
shows that DC is a nice framework to offer a unified approach to these existing
work where non-convex penalty is involved. Our work bridges the communities of
optimization and statistics.

rotation in the infalling envelope, which in turn affects the formation and
evolution of the circumstellar disk. The importance of the Hall effect varies
with the Hall coefficient, and this coefficient is determined by the fractional
abundances of charged species. These abundance values are primarily based on
the size and quantity of dust grains as well as the cosmic ray intensity, which
respectively absorb and create charged species. Thus, the Hall coefficient
varies with both the properties of dust grains and the cosmic ray rate (or
ionization source). In this study, we explore the dependence of the Hall
coefficient on the grain size and cosmic ray ionization rate using a simplified
chemical network model. Following this, using an analytic model, we estimate
the typical size of a circumstellar disk induced solely by the Hall effect. The
results show that the disk grows during the main accretion phase to a size of
${\sim}$ 3 - 100 au, with the actual size depending on the parameters. These
findings suggest that the Hall effect greatly affects circumstellar disk
formation, especially in the case that the dust grains have a typical size of

perfectly resonant cavity, the AdS spacetime enhances all nonlinear
interactions, which therefore produce effects of order one no matter how small

encoded in spectroscopic data, namely, the fine splittings of the energy levels
which would have been highly degenerate in AdS if no interactions were present.
Over long times, such energy shifts let different components of wavefunctions
drift completely out-of-phase, producing large effects for arbitrarily small

of MSE is more suitable for HDR since it puts more weight on both over- and

Perceptual loss enables the networks to utilize knowledge about objects and
image structure for recovering the intensity gradients of saturated and grossly
quantized areas. Adversarial loss helps to select the most plausible appearance
from multiple solutions. The hybrid loss that combines all the three losses is
calculated in logarithmic space of image intensity so that the outputs retain a

jointly with the Solar Dynamics Observatory data, we investigate two successive
confined eruptions (Erup1 and Erup2) of a small filament in a decaying active
region on 2017 November 10. During the process of Erup1, the overlying magnetic
arcade is observed to inflate with the rising filament at beginning and then
stop the ongoing of the explosion. In the hot EUV channel, a coronal sigmoidal
structure appears during the first eruption and fade away after the second one.
The untwisting rotation and disintegration of the filament in Erup2 are clearly
revealed by the NVST H_alpha intensity data, hinting at a pre-existing twisted
configuration of the filament. By tracking two rotating features in the
filament, the average rotational angular velocity of the unwinding filament is
found to be ~10.5 degree/min. A total twist of ~1.3 pi is estimated to be
stored in the filament before the eruption, which is far below the criteria for
kink instability. In the course of several hours prior to the event, some
photospheric flux activities, including the flux convergence and cancellation,
are detected around the northern end of the filament, where some small-scale
EUV brightenings are also captured. Moreover, strongly-sheared transverse
fields are found in the cancelling magnetic features from the vector
magnetograms. Our observational results support the flux cancellation model, in
which the interaction between the converging and sheared opposite-polarity
fluxes destabilizes the filament and triggers the ensuing ejection.

impending downtime of an equipment with a reasonable prediction horizon so that
countermeasures can be put in place. Classically, this problem has been posed
in two different ways which are typically solved independently: (1) Remaining
useful life (RUL) estimation as a long-term prediction task to estimate how
much time is left in the useful life of the equipment and (2) Failure
prediction (FP) as a short-term prediction task to assess the probability of a
failure within a pre-specified time window. As these two tasks are related,
performing them separately is sub-optimal and might results in inconsistent
predictions for the same equipment. In order to alleviate these issues, we
propose two methods: Deep Weibull model (DW-RNN) and multi-task learning
(MTL-RNN). DW-RNN is able to learn the underlying failure dynamics by fitting
Weibull distribution parameters using a deep neural network, learned with a
survival likelihood, without training directly on each task. While DW-RNN makes
an explicit assumption on the data distribution, MTL-RNN exploits the implicit
relationship between the long-term RUL and short-term FP tasks to learn the
underlying distribution. Additionally, both our methods can leverage the
non-failed equipment data for RUL estimation. We demonstrate that our methods
consistently outperform baseline RUL methods that can be used for FP while
producing consistent results for RUL and FP. We also show that our methods
perform at par with baselines trained on the objectives optimized for either of
the two tasks.

irregular scene text recognition. The RCN progressively calibrates the
irregular text to boost the recognition performance. By decomposing the
calibration process into multiple steps, the irregular text can be calibrated
to normal one step by step. Besides, in order to avoid the accumulation of lost
information caused by inaccurate transformation, we further design a
fiducial-point refinement structure to keep the integrity of text during the
recurrent process. Instead of the calibrated images, the coordinates of
fiducial points are tracked and refined, which implicitly models the
transformation information. Based on the refined fiducial points, we estimate
the transformation parameters and sample from the original image at each step.
In this way, the original character information is preserved until the final
transformation. Such designs lead to optimal calibration results to boost the
performance of succeeding recognition. Extensive experiments on challenging

domains. This research focuses on trajectory sequence prediction methods using
trajectory data obtained from the vehicles in urban traffic network. As
Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) model is previously proposed, we propose an
improved method of Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network model(ARNN) for
urban vehicle trajectory prediction. We introduce attention mechanism into
urban vehicle trajectory prediction to explain the impact of network-level
traffic state information. The model is evaluated using the Bluetooth data of
private vehicles collected in Brisbane, Australia with 5 metrics which are
widely used in the sequence modeling. The proposed ARNN model shows significant
performance improvement compared to the existing RNN models considering not
only the cells to be visited but also the alignment of the cells in sequence.

machine learning and scientific community as they exploit available low-rank
structures in kernel methods to compress the kernel matrix. The resulting
compressed matrix, HMatrix, is used to reduce the computational complexity of
operations such as HMatrix-matrix multiplications with tuneable accuracy in an
evaluation phase. Existing implementations of HMatrix evaluations do not
preserve locality and often lead to unbalanced parallel execution with high
synchronization. Also, current solutions require the compression phase to
re-execute if the kernel method or the required accuracy change. In this work,
we describe MatRox, a framework that uses novel structure analysis strategies,
blocking and coarsen, with code specialization and a storage format to improve
locality and create load-balanced parallel tasks for HMatrix-matrix
multiplications. Modularization of the matrix compression phase enables the
reuse of computations when there are changes to the input accuracy and the
kernel function. The MatRox-generated code for matrix-matrix multiplication is
2.98x, 1.60x, and 5.98x faster than library implementations available in GOFMM,
SMASH, and STRUMPACK respectively. Additionally, the ability to reuse portions
of the compression computation for changes to the accuracy leads to up to 2.64x
improvement with MatRox over five changes to accuracy using GOFMM.

treatment effect heterogeneity using transformed outcomes has relied on tree

umbrella of non-parametric models, outcome modeling has been performed using
Bayesian additive regression trees and various flavors of weighted single

in smaller samples where results are more sensitive to model misspecification -
our method attempts to garner improvements in inference quality via a correctly

with a model that assumes that the treatment assignment mechanism is known, an
extension where it is learnt from the data is presented for applications to
observational studies. Our approach is applied to simulated and real data to
demonstrate our theorized improvements in inference with respect to two causal
estimands: the conditional average treatment effect and the average treatment

accurately estimate the treatment effects while reducing their variance.

stars via comparisons between model calculations and astronomical observations,
exploiting the sensitivity of models to astrophysical conditions. However, the
sensitivity of models to nuclear physics uncertainties calls into question the
fidelity of constraints derived in this way. Using X-ray burst model
calculations performed with the code {\tt MESA}, we investigate the impact of
uncertainties for nuclear reaction rates previously identified as influential

the conditions that are thought to best reproduce the source GS 1826-24 as a
baseline. We find that reaction rate uncertainties are unlikely to
significantly change conclusions about the properties of accretion onto the
neutron star surface for this source. However, we find that reaction rate
uncertainties significantly hinder the possibility of extracting the neutron
star mass-radius ratio by matching the modeled and observed light curves due to
the influence of reaction rates on the modeled light curve shape. Particularly
influential nuclear reaction rates are $^{15}{\rm O}(\alpha,\gamma)$ and
$^{23}{\rm Al}(p,\gamma)$, though other notable impacts arise from $^{14}{\rm
O}(\alpha,p)$, $^{18}{\rm Ne}(\alpha,p)$, $^{22}{\rm Mg}(\alpha,p)$, $^{24}{\rm

failure patients as a therapeutic option. The aortic valve plays a critical
role in heart failure and its treatment with LVAD. The cardiovascular-LVAD
model is often used to investigate the physiological demands required by
patients and predict the hemodynamic of the native heart supported with a LVAD.
As a bridge to recovery treatment, it is important to maintain appropriate and
active dynamics of the aortic valve and the cardiac output of the native heart,
which requires that the LVAD pump must be adjusted so that a proper balance
between the blood contributed through the aortic valve and the pump is
maintained. In this paper, our objective is to identify a critical value of the
pump power to ensure that the LVAD pump does not take over the pumping function
in the cardiovascular-pump system and share the ejected blood with left
ventricle to help the heart to recover. In addition, hemodynamic often involves
variability due to patients heterogeneity and the stochastic nature of
cardiovascular system. The variability poses significant challenges to
understand dynamic behaviors of the aortic valve and cardiac output. A
generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion is used in this work to develop a
stochastic cardiovascular-pump model for efficient uncertainty propagation,
from which it is possible to rapidly calculate the variance in the aortic valve
opening duration and the cardiac output in the presence of variability. The
simulation results show that the gPC based cardiovascular-pump model is a
reliable platform that can provide useful information to understand the effect

-dM/dT on these compounds indicate that magnetic frustration persists in

signature of this frustration is also noted in Ce0.8Y0.2NiGe2, whereas, it is
suppressed in Ce0.6Y0.4NiGe2. Heat capacity studies on Ce0.9Y0.1NiGe2 and
Ce0.8Y0.2NiGe2 indicate the presence of a new magnetic anomaly at high field
which indicates that quantum criticality is absent in these compounds. However,
for Ce0.6Y0.4NiGe2 such an anomaly is not noted. For this later compound, the
magnetic field (H) and temperature (T) dependence of heat capacity and
magnetization obey H/T scaling above critical fields. However, the obtained
scaling critical parameter ({\delta}) is 1.6, which is away from mean field
value of 3. This deviation suggests the presence of unusual fluctuations and
anomalous quantum criticality in these compounds. This unusual fluctuation may
arise from disorderness induced by Y-substitution.

rapidly evolved over the past few years and have yielded state-of-the-art
performances over conventional methods. Since these methods usually minimized
l1 loss between the output SR image and the ground truth image, they yielded
very high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) that is inversely proportional to
these losses. Unfortunately, minimizing these losses inevitably lead to blurred
edges due to averaging of plausible solutions. Recently, SRGAN was proposed to
avoid this average effect by minimizing perceptual losses instead of l1 loss
and it yielded perceptually better SR images (or images with sharp edges) at
the price of lowering PSNR. In this paper, we propose SREdgeNet, edge enhanced
single image SR network, that was inspired by conventional SR theories so that
average effect could be avoided not by changing the loss, but by changing the
SR network property with the same l1 loss. Our SREdgeNet consists of 3
sequential deep neural network modules: the first module is any
state-of-the-art SR network and we selected a variant of EDSR. The second
module is any edge detection network taking the output of the first SR module
as an input and we propose DenseEdgeNet for this module. Lastly, the third
module is merging the outputs of the first and second modules to yield edge
enhanced SR image and we propose MergeNet for this module. Qualitatively, our
proposed method yielded images with sharp edges compared to other
state-of-the-art SR methods. Quantitatively, our SREdgeNet yielded
state-of-the-art performance in terms of structural similarity (SSIM) while

gravitational collapse leading to neutron star formation. Being distinct from a
Fe core collapse, the final evolution involves combustion flame propagation, in
which complex phase transition from ONe elements into the
nuclear-statistical-equilibrium (NSE) state takes place. We simulate the core
evolution from the O+Ne ignition until the bounce shock penetrates the whole
core, using a state-of-the-art 1D Lagrangian neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamic
code, in which important nuclear burning, electron capture, and neutrino
reactions are taken into account. Special care is also taken in making a stable
initial condition by importing the stellar EOS, which is used for the
progenitor evolution calculation, and by improving the remapping process. We
find that the central ignition leads to intense $\nu_e$ radiation with
$L_{\nu_e} \gtrsim 10^{51}$ erg s$^{-1}$ powered by fast electron captures onto
NSE isotopes. This pre-bounce $\nu_e$ radiation heats the surroundings by the
neutrino-electron scattering, which acts as a new driving mechanism of the
flame propagation together with the adiabatic contraction. The resulting flame
velocity of $\sim10^8$ cm s$^{-1}$ will be more than one-order-of-magnitude
faster than that of laminar flame driven by heat conduction. We also find that
the duration of the pre-bounce $\nu_e$ radiation phase depends on the degree of
the core hydrostatic/dynamical stability. Therefore, the future detection of
the pre-bounce neutrino is important not only to discriminate the ONe core
collapse from the Fe core collapse but also to constrain the progenitor
hydrodynamical stability.

McKeon and Sharma(2010) to account for the effect of streamwise-constant
riblets. Under the resolvent formulation, the Navier-Stokes equations are
interpreted as a forcing-response system: the nonlinear convective term is
interpreted as a feedback forcing on the remaining linear terms, which
generates a velocity and pressure response. A gain-based decomposition of the
linear forcing-response transfer function --- the resolvent operator --- yields
highly amplified velocity and pressure modes, which can be considered key
building blocks of the turbulent flow field. Previous work has shown that these
high-gain modes provide substantial insight into turbulence statistics,
structure, and control of smooth-walled flows. To introduce the effect of
riblets within this framework, a linear spatially-varying body force is added
to the governing equations. In other words, volume penalization is used to
approximate the surface features. Predictions for spanwise-periodic and
streamwise-constant riblets show that specific high-gain modes identified from
the modified governing equations reproduce observations made in prior direct
numerical simulations with limited computation. The deterioration in
performance with increasing riblet size is predicted well and so is the
emergence of spanwise rollers resembling Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices. This new
modeling framework is also used to pursue limited riblet shape optimization.

pseudo-LiDAR representations --- essentially mimicking the LiDAR signal. With
this representation we can apply different existing LiDAR-based detection
algorithms. On the popular KITTI benchmark, our approach achieves impressive
improvements over the existing state-of-the-art in image-based performance ---
raising the detection accuracy of objects within the 30m range from the
previous state-of-the-art of 22% to an unprecedented 74%. At the time of

new model is constructed to describe bremsstrahlung emission of photons which
accompanies the scattering of protons off nuclei. Our bremsstrahlung formalism
uses many-nucleon basis that allows to analyze coherent and incoherent
bremsstrahlung emissions. As scattered proton can be under the influence of
strong forces and produces the largest bremsstrahlung contribution to full
spectrum, we focus on accurate determination of its quantum evolution
concerning nucleus basing on quantum mechanics and scattering theory. For such
a motivation, we at first time generalize Pauli equation with interacting
potential describing evolution of fermion inside strong field, with including
the electromagnetic form-factors of nucleon basing on DIS theory. Anomalous
magnetic momenta of nucleons reinforce our motivation to develop such a
formalism, starting from low energy. The full bremsstrahlung spectrum in our
model (after renormalization) is dependent on form-factors of the scattered
proton. For calculations, we choose the scattering of $p + ^{197}{\rm Au}$ at
proton beam energy of 190~MeV, where experimental bremsstrahlung data were
obtained with high accuracy. We show that the full bremsstrahlung spectrum is
sensitive to the form-factors of the scattered proton. In the limit without
such form-factors, we reconstruct our previous result (where internal structure
of the scattered proton was not studied).

electric fields lead to formation of polarization compensating charges as well
as two-dimensional conductive behavior for electronic transport along
interfaces. We also find defect-like states localized at interfaces which are
optically active in the visible range.

important thermoelectric materials for converting waste heat into electricity.
Reduced electrical resistivity at the hot interface between the half-Heusler
material and a metal contact is critical for device performance, however this
has yet to be achieved in practice. Recent experimental work suggests that a
coherent interface between half-Heusler and full-Heusler compounds can form due
to diffusion of transition metal atoms into the vacant sublattice of the
half-Heusler lattice. We study theoretically the structural and electronic
properties of such an interface using a first-principles based approach that
combines {\it ab initio} calculations with macroscopic modeling. We find that
the prototypical interface HfNi$_2$Sn/HfNiSn provides very low contact
resistivity and almost ohmic behavior over a wide range of temperatures and
doping levels. Given the potential of these interfaces to remain stable over a
wide range of temperatures, our study suggests that full-Heuslers might provide
nearly ideal electrical contacts to half-Heuslers that can be harnessed for
efficient thermoelectric generator devices.

pre-training, fine-tuning, and classification, which combines both unsupervised

the radio AGNs, which leads to a significantly better performance than the
direct six-type classification. On the LRG sample, our MCRGNet achieves a total

better than those obtained in previous works. On the unLRG sample, whose labels

parameter $Q$ which measures the aligned cell motion along the circumferential
direction of a pool, the transitions at $\lambda=\lambda_{\rm C1}$ were clearly
characterized. On the basis of the detailed observations of single-cell

environment, the sharp transitions of collective motions were caused by the
cell$-$cell interactions at $\lambda=\lambda_{\rm C1}$.

conversations between an agent and a customer of a customer care service (ccs).
The application domain is the public transportation system in Paris and the
purpose is to collect statistics about customer problems in order to monitor
the service and decide priorities on the intervention for improving user
satisfaction. Of primary importance for the analysis is the detection of themes
that are the object of customer problems. Themes are defined in the application
requirements and are part of the application ontology that is implicit in the
ccs documentation. Due to variety of customer population, the structure of
conversations with an agent is unpredictable. A conversation may be about one
or more themes. Theme mentions can be interleaved with mentions of facts that
are irrelevant for the application purpose. Furthermore, in certain
conversations theme mentions are localized in specific conversation segments
while in other conversations mentions cannot be localized. As a consequence,
approaches to feature extraction with and without mention localization are
considered. Application domain relevant themes identified by an automatic
procedure are expressed by specific sentences whose words are hypothesized by
an automatic speech recognition (asr) system. The asr system is error prone.
The word error rates can be very high for many reasons. Among them it is worth
mentioning unpredictable background noise, speaker accent, and various types of
speech disfluencies. As the application task requires the composition of
proportions of theme mentions, a sequential decision strategy is introduced in
this paper for performing a survey of the large amount of conversations made
available in a given time period. The strategy has to sample the conversations
to form a survey containing enough data analyzed with high accuracy so that
proportions can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. Due to the unpredictable
type of theme mentions, it is appropriate to consider methods for theme
hypothesization based on global as well as local feature extraction. Two
systems based on each type of feature extraction will be considered by the
strategy. One of the four methods is novel. It is based on a new definition of
density of theme mentions and on the localization of high density zones whose
boundaries do not need to be precisely detected. The sequential decision
strategy starts by grouping theme hypotheses into sets of different expected
accuracy and coverage levels. For those sets for which accuracy can be improved
with a consequent increase of coverage a new system with new features is
introduced. Its execution is triggered only when specific preconditions are met
on the hypotheses generated by the basic four systems. Experimental results are
provided on a corpus collected in the call center of the Paris transportation
system known as ratp. The results show that surveys with high accuracy and
coverage can be composed with the proposed strategy and systems. This makes it
possible to apply a previously published proportion estimation approach that
takes into account hypothesization errors .

allows us to include external information in the form of a relationship graph

utility functions. We note that the existing HUIM algorithms use upper-bounds
like ""Transaction Weighted Utility"" and ""Exact-Utility, Remaining-Utility"" for
efficient search-space exploration. We derive analogous and tighter
upper-bounds for SM utility functions. We design a novel inverted-list data
structure called SMI-list and a new algorithm called SM-Miner to mine HUIs for
SM functions. We explain how existing tree-based and projection-based HUIM
algorithms can be adapted using these bounds. We experimentally compare
adaptations of some of the latest HUIM algorithms and point out some caveats
that should be kept in mind while handling utility functions that allow

reduce communication costs: (1) the use of lossy compression on the global
model sent server-to-client; and (2) Federated Dropout, which allows users to
efficiently train locally on smaller subsets of the global model and also
provides a reduction in both client-to-server communication and local

compression approaches for client-to-server communication, collectively provide
up to a $14\times$ reduction in server-to-client communication, a $1.7\times$
reduction in local computation, and a $28\times$ reduction in upload
communication, all without degrading the quality of the final model. We thus
comprehensively reduce FL's impact on client device resources, allowing higher
capacity models to be trained, and a more diverse set of users to be reached.

to obtain the greatest reward, arising in numerous application areas such as
finance, healthcare and marketing. State-of-the-art methods for
high-dimensional optimal stopping involve approximating the value function or
the continuation value, and then using that approximation within a greedy
policy. Although such policies can perform very well, they are generally not
guaranteed to be interpretable; that is, a decision maker may not be able to
easily see the link between the current system state and the policy's action.
In this paper, we propose a new approach to optimal stopping, wherein the
policy is represented as a binary tree, in the spirit of naturally
interpretable tree models commonly used in machine learning. We show that the
class of tree policies is rich enough to approximate the optimal policy. We
formulate the problem of learning such policies from observed trajectories of
the stochastic system as a sample average approximation (SAA) problem. We prove
that the SAA problem converges under mild conditions as the sample size
increases, but that computationally even immediate simplifications of the SAA
problem are theoretically intractable. We thus propose a tractable heuristic
for approximately solving the SAA problem, by greedily constructing the tree
from the top down. We demonstrate the value of our approach by applying it to
the canonical problem of option pricing, using both synthetic instances and
instances using real S&P-500 data. Our method obtains policies that (1)
outperform state-of-the-art non-interpretable methods, based on
simulation-regression and martingale duality, and (2) possess a remarkably
simple and intuitive structure.

hidden kagome-lattice-like electronic structure: one originating from Pt
$s+p_x/p_y$ orbitals, and the other from Pt $d_{3z^2-r^2}+d_{xy}/d_{x^2-y^2}$
orbitals, each placed on the bonds of the triangular lattice. In particular, we
find that the underlying Pt $s+p_x/p_y$ bands actually determine the steepness
of the original dispersion, so that the large Fermi velocity can be attributed
to the large width of the Pt $s+p_x/p_y$ band. More importantly, the
kagome-like electronic structure gives rise to ""orbital-momentum locking"" on
the Fermi surface, which reduces the electron scattering by impurities. We
conclude that the combination of the large Fermi velocity and the
orbital-momentum locking is likely to be the origin of the extremely small
resistivity in PtCoO$_2$.

unconventional electronic structure, and we have already seen significant
progress in their understanding and engineering towards real-life applications.
The interest erupted with the discovery of graphene and topological insulators
in the previous decade. The electrons in graphene simulate massless Dirac
Fermions with a linearly dispersing Dirac cone in their band structure, while
in topological insulators, the electronic bands wind non-trivially in momentum
space giving rise to gapless surface states and bulk bandgap. Weyl semimetals
in condensed matter systems are the latest addition to this growing family of
topological materials. Weyl Fermions are known in the context of high energy
physics since almost the beginning of quantum mechanics. They apparently
violate charge conservation rules, displaying the ""chiral anomaly"", with such
remarkable properties recently theoretically predicted and experimentally
verified to exist as low energy quasiparticle states in certain condensed
matter systems. Not only are these new materials extremely important for our
fundamental understanding of quantum phenomena, but also they exhibit
completely different transport phenomena. For example, massless Fermions are
susceptible to scattering from non-magnetic impurities. Dirac semimetals
exhibit non-saturating extremely large magnetoresistance as a consequence of
their robust electronic bands being protected by time reversal symmetry. These
open up whole new possibilities for materials engineering and applications
including quantum computing. In this review, we recapitulate some of the
outstanding properties of WTe$_2$, namely, its non-saturating titanic
magnetoresistance due to perfect electron and hole carrier balance up to a very
high magnetic field observed for the very first time. (Continued. Please see

imply that for concentrated solutions, the screening length exhibits an
opposite trend; it increases with ion concentration and depends on the ionic
size. The screening length is usually defined by the response of the
electrolyte solution to a test charge, but can equivalently be derived from the
charge-charge correlation function. By going beyond DH theory, we predict the
effects of ion size on the charge-charge correlation function. A simple
modification of the Coulomb interaction kernel to account for the excluded
volume of neighboring ions yields a non-monotonic dependence of the screening
length (correlation length) on the ionic concentration, as well as damped

there are two distinct groups in the ELM WD mass and orbital period plane,
indicating two different formation scenarios of such objects, i.e. a stable
Roche lobe overflow channel (RL channel) and common envelope ejection channel
(CE channel). We then systematically investigated the formation of ELM WDs in
DDs by a combination of detailed binary evolution calculation and binary
population synthesis. Our study shows that the majority of ELM WDs with mass
less than $0.22\rm\;M_\odot$ are formed from the RL channel. The most common
progenitor mass in this way is in the range of $1.15-1.45\rm\;M_\odot$ and the
resulting ELM WDs have a peak around $0.18\rm\;M_\odot$ when selection effects
are taken into account, consistent with observations. The ELM WDs with a mass
larger than $0.22\rm\;M_\odot$ are more likely to be from the CE channel and
have a peak of ELM WD mass around $0.25\rm\;M_\odot$ which needs to be
confirmed by future observations. By assuming a constant star formation rate of
2$\rm\;M_\odot yr^{-1}$ for a Milky Way-like galaxy, the birth rate and local
density are $5\times10^{-4}\rm\;yr^{-1}$ and $1500\rm\;kpc^{-3}$, respectively,
for DDs with an ELM WD mass less than $0.25\rm\;M_\odot$.

this work, we present an analysis of the star formation history (SFH) of a
field of $\sim200$ square arcmin in the central part of the galaxy. To this

evolved stars. We identify 53 such stars, 8 of which are supergiants and the
remainder are long period variables (LPV), large amplitude variables (LAV) or
extreme Asymptotic Giant Branch (x-AGB) stars. Using stellar evolution models,
we find the age and birth mass of these stars and thus reconstruct the SFH. The
average rate of star formation during the last Gyr is $\sim3\times10^{-4}$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. The absence of a dominant epoch of star
formation over the past 5 Gyr, suggests that IC 1613 has evolved in isolation
for that long, spared harrassment by other Local Group galaxies (in particular
M 31 and the Milky Way). We confirm the radial age gradient, with star
formation currently concentrated in the central regions of IC 1613, and the
failure of recent star formation to have created the main HI supershell. Based
on the current rate of star formation at $(5.5\pm2)\times10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$, the interstellar gas mass of the galaxy of $9\times10^7$ M$_\odot$

relatively small average number of the recoils, the electron spectrum reveals
some individual characteristics of the recoil spectrum. Furthermore, the

width of the electron spectrum is increasing with the number of recoils
according to the power law, with the power index being inverse to the stability

for OFDM systems that uses the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm.
This greedy algorithm retrieves one additional multipath component (MPC) per
iteration until a stop condition is met. We obtain an analytical approximation
for the OMP estimation error variance that grows with the number of retrieved
MPCs (iterations). The OMP channel estimator error variance outperforms a
classic maximum-likelihood (ML) non-sparse channel estimator by a factor of
approximately $2\hat{L}/M$ where $\hat{L}$ is the number of retrieved MPCs
(iterations) and $M$ the number of taps of the Discrete Equivalent Channel.
When the MPC amplitude distribution is heavy-tailed, the channel power is
concentrated in a subset of dominant MPCs. In this case OMP performs fewer
iterations as it retrieves only these dominant large MPCs. Hence for this MPC
amplitude distribution the estimation error advantage of OMP over ML is
improved. In particular, for channels with MPCs that have
lognormally-distributed amplitudes, the OMP estimator recovers approximately
5-15 dominant MPCs in typical mmWave channels, with 15-45 weak MPCs that remain
undetected.

associate certain collections of qubit observables. On the boundary side this
association gives rise to the well-known GHW quantum net structure. In this

electric current in the domain wall (DW) dynamics is investigated. Broadly
speaking, magnetization control knobs can be classified as energy-driving or
angular-momentum driving forces. DW propagation driven by a static magnetic
field is the best-known example of the former in which the DW speed is
proportional to the energy dissipation rate, and the current-driven DW motion
is an example of the latter. Here we show that DW propagation speed driven by a
thermal gradient can be fully explained as the angular momentum transfer
between thermally generated spin current and DW. We found DW-plane rotation
speed increases as DW width decreases. Both DW propagation speed along the wire
and DW-plane rotation speed around the wire decrease with the Gilbert damping.
These facts are consistent with the angular momentum transfer mechanism, but
are distinct from the energy dissipation mechanism. We further show that
magnonic spin-transfer torque (STT) generated by a thermal gradient has both
damping-like and field-like components. By analyzing DW propagation speed and
DW-plane rotation speed, the coefficient ( \b{eta}) of the field-like STT
arising from the non-adiabatic process, is obtained. It is found that \b{eta}
does not depend on the thermal gradient; increases with uniaxial anisotropy
K_(||) (thinner DW); and decreases with the damping, in agreement with the
physical picture that a larger damping or a thicker DW leads to a better
alignment between the spin-current polarization and the local magnetization, or
a better adiabaticity.

(soft) optical phonons. In particular, it is seen that a strong boson peak
anomaly (low-energy excess of modes) in the VDOS can be due almost entirely to
the presence of low-energy optical phonons, provided that their energy is
comparable to that of the acoustic modes at the Brillouin zone boundary. The
boson peak is predicted also to occur in the heat capacity at low $T$. In
presence of strong damping (which might be due to anharmonicities in the
ordered crystals), these optical phonons contribute to the low-$T$ deviation
from Debye's $T^{3}$ law, producing a linear-in-$T$ behavior which is typical
of glasses, even though no assumptions of disorder whatsoever are made in the
model. These findings are relevant for understanding and tuning thermal
transport properties of thermoelectric compounds, and possibly for the
enhancement of electron-phonon superconductivity.

very poorly constrained, while a better understanding of the low-x structure is
crucial for measurements at the LHC and also for the planning of experiments at
future hadron colliders. In addition, deviations from linear QCD evolution are
expected to appear at low x, potentially leading to gluon saturation and a
universal state of hadronic matter, the color-glass condensate. However, these
effects have not been unambiguously proven to date. Fortunately, data from the
LHC can be used directly to provide better constraints of the parton
distribution functions (PDFs). In this context, a Forward Calorimeter (FoCal)
is proposed as an addition to the ALICE experiment, to be installed in the Long
Shutdown 3.
  The main goal of the FoCal proposal is to measure forward direct photons in
pp and p-Pb collisions to obtain experimental constraints on proton and nuclear
PDFs in a new region of low x. Based on the current knowledge from DIS
experiments and first results from LHC, we will discuss the physics case for
this proposed detector. While open charm measurements do provide important
constraints, a photon measurement would provide additional unique information.
The direct photon measurement requires a new electromagnetic calorimeter with
extremely high granularity. The corresponding innovative design principle of a
high-resolution Si-W sandwich calorimeter is discussed.

into their equivalent non-randomized, canonical versions. This in turn allows
for real images to also be translated into canonical sim images. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this sim-to-real approach by training a vision-based
closed-loop grasping reinforcement learning agent in simulation, and then
transferring it to the real world to attain 70% zero-shot grasp success on
unseen objects, a result that almost doubles the success of learning the same

optimization problems. The main issue is that the computational complexity of
these problems grows exponentially in the number of variables instead of
polynomially as for many convex optimization problems. However, often the
non-convexity stems only from a subset of variables. Conventional global
optimization frameworks like monotonic optimization or DC programming treat all
variables as global variables and require complicated, problem specific
decomposition approaches to exploit the convexity in some variables. To
overcome this challenge, we develop an easy-to-use algorithm that inherently
differentiates between convex and non-convex variables, preserving the low
computational complexity in the number of convex variables. Another issue with
these widely used frameworks is that they may suffer from severe numerical
problems. We discuss this issue in detail and provide a clear motivating
example. The solution to this problem is to replace the traditional approach of
finding an {\epsilon}-approximate solution by the novel concept of
{\epsilon}-essential feasibility. The underlying algorithmic approach is called
successive incumbent transcending (SIT) algorithm and builds the foundation of
our developed algorithm. A further highlight of this algorithm is that it
inherently treats fractional objectives making the use of Dinkelbach's
iterative algorithm obsolete. Numerical experiments show a speed-up of four
orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art algorithms and almost three orders of
magnitude of additional speed-up over Dinkelbach's algorithm for fractional
programs.

antinuclei, particularly antideuterons, which are recognized as essentially
background-free signals from dark matter annihilation or decay. The GAPS Si(Li)
detector design is a thickness of 2.5 mm, diameter of 10 cm and 8 readout
strips. The energy resolution of <4 keV (FWHM) for 20 to 100 keV X-rays at
temperature of -35 to -45 C, far above the liquid nitrogen temperatures
frequently used to achieve fine energy resolution, is required. We developed a
high-quality Si crystal and Li-evaporation, diffusion and drift methods to form
a uniform Li-drifted layer. Guard ring structure and optimal etching of the
surface are confirmed to suppress the leakage current, which is a main source
of noise. We found a thin un-drifted layer retained on the p-side effectively
suppresses the leakage current. By these developments, we succeeded in
developing the GAPS Si(Li) detector. As the ultimate GAPS instrument will
require >1000 10-cm diameter Si(Li) detectors to achieve high sensitivity to
rare antideuteron events, high-yield production is also a key factor for the
success of the GAPS mission.

physical parameters of these threads and their structuring remain poorly
constrained. We use prominence seismology techniques to analyse transverse
oscillations in threads through the comparison between magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) models and observations. We apply Bayesian methods to obtain two
different types of information. We first infer the marginal posterior
distribution of physical parameters, such as the magnetic field strength or the
length of the thread, when a totally filled tube, a partially filled tube, and
three damping models (resonant absorption in the Alfv\'en continuum, resonant
absorption in the slow continuum, and Cowling's diffusion) are considered as
certain. Then, we compare the relative plausibility between alternative MHD
models by computing the Bayes factors. Well constrained probability density
distributions can be obtained for the magnetic field strength, the length of
the thread, the density contrast, and parameters associated to damping models.
When comparing the damping models of resonant absorption in the Alfv\'en
continuum, resonant absorption in the slow continuum and Cowling's diffusion
due to partial ionisation of prominence plasma, the resonant absorption in the
Alfv\'en continuum is the most plausible mechanism in explaining the existing
observations. Relations between periods of fundamental and first overtone kink
modes with values around 1 are better explained by expressions of the period
ratio in the long thread approximation, while the rest of the values are more
probable in the short thread limit for the period ratio. Our results show that
Bayesian analysis offers valuable methods for performing parameter inference

usage. Within this context, we (i) derive worst-case bounds for the optimal
cost and competitive cost ratios of different classes of ""cache on $M^{th}$

expressions and bounds under arbitrary inter-request distributions, (iii)
derive explicit average cost expressions and bounds for short-tailed

policies. Our results show that a window-based ""cache on $2^{nd}$ request""
policy using a single threshold optimized to minimize worst-case costs provides
good average performance across the different distributions and the full
parameter ranges of each considered distribution, making it an attractive
choice for a wide range of practical conditions where request rates of
individual file objects typically are not known and can change quickly.

Program Repair (APR). Notably, it has been demonstrated to produce more
acceptable and correct patches than the patches obtained with mutation
operators through genetic programming. The performance of pattern-based APR
systems, however, depends on the fix ingredients mined from fix changes in
development histories. Unfortunately, collecting a reliable set of bug fixes in
repositories can be challenging. In this paper, we propose to investigate the
possibility in an APR scenario of leveraging code changes that address
violations by static bug detection tools. To that end, we build the AVATAR APR
system, which exploits fix patterns of static analysis violations as
ingredients for patch generation. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, we show
that, assuming a perfect localization of faults, AVATAR can generate correct
patches to fix 34/39 bugs. We further find that AVATAR yields performance
metrics that are comparable to that of the closely-related approaches in the
literature. While AVATAR outperforms many of the state-of-the-art pattern-based
APR systems, it is mostly complementary to current approaches. Overall, our
study highlights the relevance of static bug finding tools as indirect

considered, the most probable values of the parameter are centered in the range

agreement with the analytical model (AMO). We find that the RAT efficiency
scales as $(\lambda/a)^{-3}$ for $\lambda\gg a$ as previously found in LH07.
This increases the power of predictions obtained with the RAT theory. We also
confirm that superparamagnetic inclusions are necessary in achieving high

a $\sim$1-2 Myr period. We expect substantial differences in initial conditions

systems when applied to the Defects4J benchmark. Then, we explore the
performance variations that can be achieved by `tweaking' the FL step.
Eventually, we expect to create a new momentum for (1) full disclosure of APR

These signatures have been interpreted as evidence of small-scale, recurrent
magnetic reconnection episodes between the emerging flux region (EFR) and the
pre-existing plage field. Here, we characterize the UV emission of these
strong, intermittent brightenings and we study the surge activity above the
chromospheric arch filament system (AFS) overlying the EFR. We analyze the
surges and the cospatial brightenings observed at different wavelengths. We
find an asymmetry in the emission between the blue and red wings of the Si IV

of the structures above the AFS that form during the small-scale eruptive

with electron for the different layer structures. And the orbital hybridization
of Sn atoms existing only in bilayer structure changes the conduction band edge

transport performance of bilayer is superior to others. In addition, the

The time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation of H$_2^+$ is numerically solved in
{the multipolar} gauge in which the electric quadrupole term and the magnetic
dipole term are explicitly expressed. This allows us to separate the
contributions of the two terms in the momentum transfer. For different
configurations of the molecular and the laser orientation, the transferred
momentum to the electron is evaluated at different internuclear distances with
various photon energies { and two-center interferences are identified in the

find significant deviations from the prediction of the classical double-slit
model due to the strong mediation of the Coulomb potential.} Finally, even for
a large internuclear distance, our results show that a varying molecular
scattering phase is important at all electron energies, which is beyond the
simple prediction of the linear combination of the atomical orbitals.

cosmologically interesting three-dimensional Gaussian random fields in terms of
their Betti numbers $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. We show that Betti
numbers entail a considerably richer characterization of the topology of the
primordial density field. Of particular interest is that Betti numbers specify
which topological features - islands, cavities or tunnels - define its spatial
structure.
  A principal characteristic of Gaussian fields is that the three Betti numbers
dominate the topology at different density ranges. At extreme density levels,
the topology is dominated by a single class of features. At low levels this is
a \emph{Swiss-cheeselike} topology, dominated by isolated cavities, at high
levels a predominantly \emph{Meatball-like} topology of isolated objects. At
moderate density levels, two Betti number define a more \emph{Sponge-like}
topology. At mean density, the topology even needs three Betti numbers,
quantifying a field consisting of several disconnected complexes, not of one
connected and percolating overdensity.
  A {\it second} important aspect of Betti number statistics is that they are
sensitive to the power spectrum. It reveals a monotonic trend in which at a
moderate density range a lower spectral index corresponds to a considerably
higher (relative) population of cavities and islands.
  We also assess the level of complementary information that Betti numbers
represent, in addition to conventional measures such as Minkowski functionals.
To this end, we include an extensive description of the Gaussian Kinematic
Formula (GKF), which represents a major theoretical underpinning for this

causally disconnected regions, say $R$ and $L$ separated by another region,
$C$. We are interested in the field theory in $R\cup L$ to understand the long
range quantum correlations between $R$ and $L$. There are local modes of the
Dirac field having supports individually either in $R$ or $L$, as well as
global modes found via analytically continuing the $R$ modes to $L$ and vice
versa. However, we show that unlike the case of a scalar field, the analytic
continuation does not preserve the orthogonality of the resulting global modes.
Accordingly, we need to orthonormalise them following the Gram-Schmidt
prescription, prior to the field quantisation in order to preserve the
canonical anti-commutation relations. We observe that this prescription
naturally incorporates a spacetime independent continuous parameter,
$\theta_{\rm RL}$, into the picture. Thus interestingly, we obtain a naturally
emerging one-parameter family of $\alpha$-like de Sitter vacua. The values of
$\theta_{\rm RL}$ yielding the usual thermal spectra of massless created
particles are pointed out. Next, using these vacua, we investigate both
entanglement and R\'enyi entropies of either of the regions and demonstrate

there are seven regular black hole solutions. We find that four of these can
have the same conserved charges as the BMPV black hole. These consist of a
black lens with L(3,1) horizon topology and three distinct families of
spherical black holes with nontrivial topology outside the horizon. The former
provides the first example of a nonspherical black hole with the same conserved

have a greater entropy than the BMPV black hole near the BMPV upper spin bound.
One of these is a previously known spherical black hole with nontrivial

the integer $n$ to the number of classes in the quotient, by this $k$-binomial
equivalence relation, of the set of factors of length $n$ occurring in

this paper, we characterize the $k$-binomial complexity of the Thue--Morse

Although the Thue--Morse word is aperiodic, its $k$-binomial complexity
eventually takes only two values. In this paper, we first obtain general

framework to study such operators in interim ranges of the parameters which so
far has eluded previous results. Explicitly, we consider twist-two anomalous

S-dual invariant, hence the observables are expected be modular invariant. To
probe the finite $N$ physics, we take into account the non-planar and instanton
contributions by constructing modular invariant interpolating functions to
approximate the cusp and twist-two anomalous dimensions. We also consider
interpolating functions for the twist-four operators and study level crossing

particles. However, from collision experiments it follows that it consists of a
'soup' of countless 'colored' elementary particles such as quarks and gluons
that are kept together by the strong nuclear force. The particles constituting
the proton are also referred to as partons and their distributions are
described by parton distribution functions (PDFs). As these functions cannot be
calculated, they must be extracted from experiment. More knowledge on PDFs
teaches us more about the inner workings of protons and enables us to more
accurately describe collisions between protons at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC).
  In this thesis we have studied quantities that depend on various types of
PDFs. We have investigated one particular PDF called the Boer-Mulders function
that describes correlations between the spin and transverse momentum of quarks
inside the proton. This function gives rise to a very specific asymmetry in the
directions of produced particles. In contrast to earlier expectations, we have
shown that this PDF does not suffer from quantum effects related to color
entanglement. Furthermore, we have introduced various new gluon PDFs that
contain interesting information on the behavior of gluons. As it turns out, the
description of the gluon content of particles such as protons simplifies
tremendously in certain collisions at very high energies. Finally, we have
derived how certain asymmetries that have been observed in collisions between
protons and lead nuclei at the LHC can be related to quantum correlations
between gluons.

lacking dark matter based on a spectroscopic study of its constituent globular
clusters. Here we present the first spectroscopic analysis of the stellar body
of this galaxy using the MUSE integral-field spectrograph at the (ESO) Very
Large Telescope. The MUSE datacube simultaneously provides DF2's stellar
velocity field and systemic velocities for seven globular clusters (GCs). We
further discovered three planetary nebulae (PNe) that are likely part of this
galaxy. While five of the clusters had velocities measured in the literature,
we were able to confirm the membership of two more candidates through precise
radial velocity measurements, which increases the measured specific frequency
of GCs in DF2. The mean velocity of the diffuse stellar body,
1792.9$^{-1.8}_{+1.4}$~\kms, is consistent with the mean globular cluster
velocity. We detect a weak but significant velocity gradient within the stellar
body, with a kinematic axis close to the photometric major-axis, making it a
prolate-like rotator. We estimate a velocity dispersion from the clusters and
PNe of $\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}=10.6^{+3.9}_{-2.3}$~\kms. The velocity dispersion
$\sigma_{\rm{DF2}\star}$(\re) for the stellar body within one effective radius
is $10.8^{-4.0}_{+3.2}$~\kms. Considering various sources of systemic
uncertainties this central value varies between 5 and 13~\kms, and we

one \re\ of 21~\kms. We provide updated mass estimates based on these

excess of its globular clusters (GCs) at an initially assumed distance of
20Mpc, suggested a new formation channel for UDGs. We present the first
systematic spectroscopic analysis of both the stellar body and the GCs (six of
which were previously known, and one newly confirmed member) of this galaxy
using MUSE@VLT. Even though NGC 1052-DF2 does not show any spatially extended
emission lines we report the discovery of three planetary nebulae (PNe). We
conduct full spectral fitting on the UDG and the stacked spectra of all GCs.
The UDG's stellar population is old, 8.9$\pm$1.5 Gyr, metal-poor, with [M/H] =
$-$1.07$\pm$0.12 with little or no $\alpha$-enrichment. The stacked spectrum of
all GCs indicates a similar age of 8.9$\pm$1.8 Gyr, but lower metallicity, with
[M/H] = $-$1.63$\pm$0.09, and similarly low $\alpha$-enrichment. There is no
evidence for a variation of age and metallicity in the GC population with the
available spectra. The significantly more metal-rich stellar body with respect
to its associated GCs, the age of the population, its metallicity and alpha
enrichment, are all in line with other dwarf galaxies. NGC 1052-DF2 thus falls
on the same empirical mass-metallicity relation as other dwarfs, for the full
distance range assumed in the literature. We find that both debated distance
estimates (13 and 20 Mpc) are similarly likely, given the three discovered PNe.

positive closed currents - can be constructed by pulling back smooth closed
forms using rational maps. These currents are very singular in general, and
hence defining intersections between them is challenging. In this paper, we use
our previous results to investigate this question in the case where the
rational maps in question are pseudo-isomorphisms (i.e. bimeromorphic maps
which, along with their inverses, have no exceptional divisors) in dimension
$3$. Our main result, to be described in a more concrete form later in the
paper, is as follows.
  {\bf Theorem.} Let $X,Y$ be compact K\""ahler manifolds of dimension $3$, and
$f:X\dashrightarrow Y$ be a pseudo-isomorphism. Let $\alpha _2,\alpha _3$ be
smooth closed $(1,1)$ forms on $Y$, and $T_1$ a difference of two positive
closed $(1,1)$ currents on $X$. Then, whether the intersection of the currents
$T_1$, $f^*(\alpha _2)$ and $f^*(\alpha _3)$ satisfies a Bedford-Taylor's type
monotone convergence depends only on the cohomology classes of $\alpha
_2,\alpha _3$.
  Special attention is given to the case where $T_1=f^*(\alpha _1)$ where
$\alpha _1$ is a smooth closed $(1,1)$ form on $Y$. It is then shown that
satisfying the above mentioned Bedford-Taylor's type monotone convergence is
asymmetric in $\alpha _1$, $\alpha _2$ and $\alpha _3$, but in contrast the
resulting signed measure is symmetric in $\alpha _1$, $\alpha _2$ and $\alpha
_3$. We relate this Bedford-Taylor's type monotone convergence to the
least-negative intersection we defined previously. These results can be
extended to the case where $\alpha _1$, $\alpha _2$, $\alpha _3$ are more
singular. Dynamics of pseudo-isomorphisms in dimension $3$ are essential in
proving these results.

hard X-ray spectrum (14$-$195 keV photon index = $1.5\pm0.4$), DA 193 presents
a case to study a typical high-redshift blazar with inverse Compton peak being
located at MeV energies. An intense GeV flare was observed from this object in
the first week of 2018 January, a phenomenon rarely observed from high-redshift

random unitary. The first toy model corresponds to the case where the
coarse-grained entropy of a black hole is larger than its entanglement entropy.
We find that, while the outgoing mode and the remaining black hole are
entangled, the Hayden-Preskill recovery cannot be performed. The second toy
model corresponds to the case where the system consists of low energy soft
modes and high energy heavy modes. We find that the Hayden-Preskill recovery
protocol can be carried out via soft modes whereas heavy modes give rise to
classical correlations between the outgoing mode and the remaining black hole.
We also point out that the procedure of constructing the interior partners of
the outgoing soft mode operators can be interpreted as the Hayden-Preskill
recovery, and as such, the known recovery protocol enables us to explicitly
write down the interior operators. Hence, while the infalling mode needs to be
described jointly by the remaining black hole and the early radiation in our
toy model, adding a few extra qubits from the early radiation is sufficient to
reconstruct the interior operators.

proven to be paramount to a large range of applications, including the
high-fidelity modeling of high-intensity laser-matter interactions with
Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes. To enable a massively parallel scaling of these
solvers, a novel parallelization technique was recently proposed, which
consists in splitting the simulation domain into several processor sub-domains,
with guard regions appended at each sub-domain boundaries. Maxwell's equations
are advanced independently on each sub-domain using local shared-memory FFTs
(instead of a single distributed global FFT). This implies small truncation
errors at sub-domain boundaries, the amplitude of which depends on guard
regions sizes and order of the Maxwell solver. For a moderate number of guard
cells (<10) , this 'local' technique proved to be highly scalable on up to a
million cores. Yet, depending on the targeted applications, the number of guard
cells required to mitigate truncations errors might be very large, which would
severely limit the parallel efficiency of this technique due to the large
volume of guard cells to be exchanged between sub-domains. In this context, we
propose a novel 'hybrid' parallelization technique that ensures very good
scaling of FFT-based solvers with an arbitrarily high number of guard cells. It
consists in performing distributed FFTs on local groups of processors with
guard regions now appended to boundaries of each group of processors. A dual
domain decomposition method is used for the Maxwell solver and other parts of
the PIC cycle to keep the simulation load-balanced. This 'hybrid' technique was
implemented in the open source exascale library PICSAR. Benchmarks show that
for a large number of guard cells ($>16$), the 'hybrid' technique offers a
$\times 3$ speed-up and $\times 8$ memory savings compared to the 'local' one.

admit infinite orbits: for such a word, every prefix is expandable.

the action of T. In fact, this can be done in exponential nondeterministic
space. From this nondeterministic algorithm, we obtain a bound on the length of
a potential orbit-increasing suffix x. Moreover, we investigate the situation
if the automaton is invertible and generates a group. In this case, we give an
algebraic characterization for the expandability of a word based on its shifted
stabilizer. We also give a more efficient algorithm to decide expandability of
a word in the case of automaton groups, which allows us to improve the upper
bound on the maximal orbit-increasing suffix length. Then, we investigate the

trigonal prismatic crystal structure. We chose to study this special symmetry
group since these materials do break inversion symmetry and therefore, in
principle, allow for chiral spin structures such as magnetic helices and
skyrmions. However, unlike all non-centrosymmetric magnets known so far, we
show that the symmetry of magnetic trigonal prismatic monolayers neither allow
for an internal relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) nor a
reactive spin-orbit torque. We demonstrate that the DMI only becomes important
at the boundaries, where it modifies the boundary conditions of the
magnetization and leads to a helical equilibrium state with a helical
wavevector that is inherently linked to the internal spin orientation.
Furthermore, we find that the helical wavevector can be electrically
manipulated via dissipative spin-torque mechanisms. Our results reveal that 2D

Besides this technical issue, Simmons' model relies on a mean-barrier
approximation for electron transmission through the potential-energy barrier
between the metals. In order to test Simmons' expression for the local current
density when the correct image potential energy is included, we compare the
results of this expression with those provided by a transfer-matrix technique.
This technique is known to provide numerically exact solutions of Schrodinger's

provided by a numerical integration of the transmission probability obtained
with the WKB approximation and Simmons' mean-barrier approximation. The
comparison between these different models shows that Simmons' expression for
the local current density actually provides results that are in good agreement
with those provided by the transfer-matrix technique, for a range of conditions
of practical interest. We show that Simmons' model provides good results in the
linear and field-emission regimes of current density versus voltage plots. It
loses its applicability when the top of the potential-energy barrier drops

relaying switching between full-duplex (FD) and half-duplex (HD) mode to help a

insightfully. The \emph{first scenario} is that no direct link exists between
the base station (BS) and far user. The \emph{second scenario} is that the
direct link exists between the BS and far user. To characterize the performance
of potential gains brought by FD NOMA in two considered scenarios, three
performance metrics outage probability, ergodic rate and energy efficiency are
discussed. More particularly, we derive new closed-form expressions for both
exact and asymptotic outage probabilities as well as delay-limited throughput
for two NOMA users. Based on the derived results, the diversity orders achieved
by users are obtained. We confirm that the use of direct link overcomes zero
diversity order of far NOMA user inherent to FD relaying. Additionally, we
derive new closed-form expressions for asymptotic ergodic rates. Based on
these, the high signal-to-noise radio (SNR) slopes of two users for FD NOMA are
obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) FD NOMA is superior to HD
NOMA in terms of outage probability and ergodic sum rate in the low SNR region;
and 2) In delay-limited transmission mode, FD NOMA has higher energy efficiency
than HD NOMA in the low SNR region; However, in delay-tolerant transmission
mode, the system energy efficiency of HD NOMA exceeds FD NOMA in the high SNR
region.

knowledge of a label-rich domain (source domain) to a label-scarce domain

widely applied method for the aforementioned task. However, the method does not
perform well when classes in the two domains are not identical. Specifically,
when the classes of the target correspond to a subset of those of the source,
target samples can be incorrectly aligned with the classes that exist only in
the source. This problem setting is termed as partial domain adaptation (PDA).
In this study, we propose a novel method called Two Weighted
Inconsistency-reduced Networks (TWINs) for PDA. We utilize two classification
networks to estimate the ratio of the target samples in each class with which a
classification loss is weighted to adapt the classes present in the target
domain. Furthermore, to extract discriminative features for the target, we
propose to minimize the divergence between domains measured by the classifiers'
inconsistency on target samples. We empirically demonstrate that reducing the
inconsistency between two networks is effective for PDA and that our method

A widely
adopted approach to crash prediction is application of regression based
techniques. The underlying calibration process is often time-consuming,
requiring significant domain knowledge and expertise and cannot be easily
automated. This paper introduces a new machine learning (ML) based approach as
an alternative to the traditional techniques. The proposed ML model is called
regularized deep belief network, which is a deep neural network with two
training steps: it is first trained using an unsupervised learning algorithm
and then fine-tuned by initializing a Bayesian neural network with the trained
weights from the first step. The resulting model is expected to have improved
prediction power and reduced need for the time-consuming human intervention. In
this paper, we attempt to demonstrate the potential of this new model for crash
prediction through two case studies including a collision data set from 800 km
stretch of Highway 401 and other highways in Ontario, Canada. Our intention is
to show the performance of this ML approach in comparison to various
traditional models including negative binomial (NB) model, kernel regression
(KR), and Bayesian neural network (Bayesian NN). We also attempt to address
other related issues such as effect of training data size and training

Solar Rossby waves (r modes) have recently been discovered in the
near-surface horizontal flow field using the techniques of granulation-tracking
and ring-diagram analysis applied to six years of SDO/HMI data.
  Aims. Here we apply time-distance helioseismology to the combined SOHO/MDI
and SDO/HMI data sets, which cover 21 years of observations from May 1996 to
April 2017. The goal of this study is to provide an independent confirmation
over two solar cycles and in deeper layers of the Sun.
  Methods. We have measured south-north helioseismic travel times along the
equator, which are sensitive to subsurface north-south flows. To reduce noise,
the travel times were averaged over travel distances from 6$^\circ$ to
30$^\circ$; the mean distance corresponds to a p-mode lower turning point of
0.91 $R_\odot$. The 21-year time series of travel-time measurements was split
into three seven-year subsets and transformed to obtain power spectra in a
corotating frame.
  Results. The power spectra all show peaks near the frequencies of the
classical sectoral Rossby waves for azimuthal wavenumbers in the range $3 \leq
m \leq 15$. The mode frequencies and linewidths of the modes with $m \leq 9$
are consistent with a previous study whereas modes with $m \geq 10$ are shifted
toward less negative frequencies by 10--20 nHz. While most of these modes have
e-folding lifetimes on the order of a few months, the longest lived mode,
$m=3$, has an e-folding lifetime of more than one year. For each mode, the rms
velocity at the equator is in the range of 1--3 m s$^{-1}$ , with the largest
values for $m\sim10$. No evidence for the $m=2$ sectoral mode is found in the
power spectrum, implying that the rms velocity of this mode is below $\sim$0.5
m s$^{-1}$.

outside the active site in the essential E. coli enzyme adenylate kinase result
in stability-dependent increase in substrate inhibition by AMP, thereby
impairing overall enzyme activity at high stability. Such inhibition caused
substantial fitness defects not only in the presence of excess substrate but
also under physiological conditions. In the latter case, substrate inhibition
caused differential accumulation of AMP in the stationary phase for the
inhibition prone mutants. Further, we show that changes in flux through Adk

these data suggest that selection against substrate inhibition and hence excess

3DUP indicator technetium (Tc) in their atmosphere form a different sequence of
K-[22] colour as a function of pulsation period than Miras without Tc. A near-
to mid-infrared colour such as K-[22] is a good probe for the dust mass-loss
rate of the stars. Contrary to what might be expected, Tc-poor Miras show
redder K-[22] colours (i.e. higher dust mass-loss rates) than Tc-rich Miras at
a given period. Here, the previous sample is extended and the analysis is
expanded towards other colours and dust spectra. The most important aim is to
investigate if the same two sequences can be revealed in the gas mass-loss
rate. We analysed new optical spectra and expanded the sample by including more
stars from the literature. Near- and mid-IR photometry and ISO dust spectra of
our stars were investigated. Literature data of gas mass-loss rates of Miras
and semi-regular variables were collected and analysed. Our results show that
Tc-poor Miras are redder than Tc-rich Miras in a broad range of the mid-IR,
suggesting that the previous finding based on the K-[22] colour is not due to a
specific dust feature in the 22 micron band. We establish a linear relation
between K-[22] and the gas mass-loss rate. We also find that the 13 micron
feature disappears above K-[22]~2.17 mag, corresponding to $\dot{M}_{\rm
g}\sim2.6\times10^{-7}M_{\sun}yr^{-1}$. No similar sequences of Tc-poor and
Tc-rich Miras in the gas mass-loss rate vs. period diagram are found, most
probably owing to limitations in the available data. Different hypotheses to
explain the observation of two sequences in the P vs. K-[22] diagram are
discussed and tested, but so far none of them convincingly explains the
observations. Nevertheless, we might have found an hitherto unknown but
potentially important process influencing mass loss on the TP-AGB.

easy task. It requires a set of accurate measurements combined with theoretical
models that are used to infer the planetary composition and its depth
dependence. The masses of Jupiter and Saturn are 317.83 and 95.16 Earth masses,
respectively, and since a few decades, we know that they mostly consist of
hydrogen and helium. It is the mass of heavy elements (all elements heavier
than helium) that is not well determined, as well as their distribution within
the planets. While the heavy elements are not the dominating materials in
Jupiter and Saturn they are the key for our understanding of their formation
and evolution histories.
  The planetary internal structure is inferred from theoretical models that fit
the available observational constraints by using theoretical equations of
states (EOSs) for hydrogen, helium, their mixtures, and heavier elements
(typically rocks and/or ices). However, there is no unique solution for the
planetary structure and the results depend on the used EOSs and the model
assumptions imposed by the modeler. Major model assumptions that can affect the
derived internal structure include the number of layers, the heat transport
mechanism within the planet (and its entropy), the nature of the core (compact
vs. diluted), and the location (pressure) of separation between the two
envelopes. Alternative structure models assume a less distinct division between
the layers and/or a non-homogenous distribution of the heavy elements. Today,
with accurate measurements of the gravitational fields of Jupiter and Saturn
from the Juno and Cassini missions, structure models can be further
constrained. At the same time, these measurements introduce new challenges for
planetary modellers.

modern weak lensing large-scale structure surveys. Specifically, we focus on
the joint weak lensing convergence power spectrum-bispectrum probe and we
tackle the numerical challenges required by a realistic analysis. Under the
assumption of (multivariate) Gaussian likelihoods, we have developed a high
performance code that allows highly parallelised prediction of the binned
tomographic observables and of their joint non-Gaussian covariance matrix
accounting for terms up to the 6-point correlation function and super-sample
effects. This performance allows us to qualitatively address several
interesting scientific questions. We find that the bispectrum provides an
improvement in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of about 10% on top of the
power spectrum, making it a non-negligible source of information for future
surveys. Furthermore, we are capable to test the impact of theoretical
uncertainties in the halo model used to build our observables; with presently
allowed variations we conclude that the impact is negligible on the S/N.
Finally, we consider data compression possibilities to optimise future analyses
of the weak lensing bispectrum. We find that, ignoring systematics, 5
equipopulated redshift bins are enough to recover the information content of a
Euclid-like survey, with negligible improvement when increasing to 10 bins. We
also explore principal component analysis and dependence on the triangle shapes
as ways to reduce the numerical complexity of the problem.

The history was analyzed jointly by software engineering academics and

conv-layers of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The mined
object-part patterns are organized by an And-Or graph (AOG). This interpretable
AOG representation consists of a four-layer semantic hierarchy, i.e., semantic
parts, part templates, latent patterns, and neural units. The AOG associates
each object part with certain neural units in feature maps of conv-layers. The
AOG is constructed in a weakly-supervised manner, i.e., very few annotations
(e.g., 3-20) of object parts are used to guide the learning of AOGs. We develop
a question-answering (QA) method that uses active human-computer communications
to mine patterns from a pre-trained CNN, in order to incrementally explain more
features in conv-layers. During the learning process, our QA method uses the
current AOG for part localization. The QA method actively identifies objects,
whose feature maps cannot be explained by the AOG. Then, our method asks people
to annotate parts on the unexplained objects, and uses answers to discover CNN
patterns corresponding to the newly labeled parts. In this way, our method
gradually grows new branches and refines existing branches on the AOG to
semanticize CNN representations. In experiments, our method exhibited a high
learning efficiency. Our method used about 1/6-1/3 of the part annotations for
training, but achieved similar or better part-localization performance than

which, unfortunately, results in challenging mixed-integer nonlinear
programming (MINLP) problems in most cases. Machine learning-based methods have
recently emerged as a disruptive way to obtain near-optimal performance for
MINLPs with affordable computational complexity. There have been some attempts
in applying such methods to resource management in wireless networks, but these
attempts require huge amounts of training samples and lack the capability to
handle constrained problems. Furthermore, they suffer from severe performance
deterioration when the network parameters change, which commonly happens and is
referred to as the task mismatch problem. In this paper, to reduce the sample
complexity and address the feasibility issue, we propose a framework of
Learning to Optimize for Resource Management (LORM). Instead of the end-to-end
learning approach adopted in previous studies, LORM learns the optimal pruning
policy in the branch-and-bound algorithm for MINLPs via a sample-efficient
method, namely, imitation learning. To further address the task mismatch
problem, we develop a transfer learning method via self-imitation in LORM,
named LORM-TL, which can quickly adapt a pre-trained machine learning model to
the new task with only a few additional unlabeled training samples. Numerical
simulations will demonstrate that LORM outperforms specialized state-of-the-art
algorithms and achieves near-optimal performance, while achieving significant
speedup compared with the branch-and-bound algorithm. Moreover, LORM-TL, by
relying on a few unlabeled samples, achieves comparable performance with the
model trained from scratch with sufficient labeled samples.

but it does become tractable on interesting classes of structures, such as on
classes whose Gaifman graphs have bounded treewidth. In this paper we continue
this line of research and study model-checking for first- and monadic
second-order logic in the presence of an ordering on the input structure. We do
so in two settings: the general ordered case, where the input structures are
equipped with a fixed order or successor relation, and the order invariant
case, where the formulas may resort to an ordering, but their truth must be
independent of the particular choice of order. In the first setting we show
very strong intractability results for most interesting classes of structures.
In contrast, in the order invariant case we obtain tractability results for
order-invariant monadic second-order formulas on the same classes of graphs as
in the unordered case. For first-order logic, we obtain tractability of
successor-invariant formulas on classes whose Gaifman graphs have bounded

fundamental importance to tailor and transmit sound for a variety of
applications. In electromagnetics, zero-permittivity metamaterials have been
used to enhance the coupling of energy in and out of ultranarrow channels,
based on a phenomenon known as supercoupling. These metamaterial channels can
support total transmission and complete phase uniformity, independent of the
channel length, despite being geometrically mismatched to their input and
output ports. In the field of acoustics, this phenomenon is challenging to
achieve, since it requires zero-density metamaterials, typically realized with
waveguides periodically loaded with membranes or resonators. Compared to
electromagnetics, the additional challenge is due to the fact that conventional
acoustic waveguides do not support a cut-off for the dominant mode of
propagation, and therefore zero-index can be achieved only based on a
collective resonance of the loading elements. Here we propose and
experimentally realize acoustic supercoupling in a dual regime, using a
compressibility-near-zero acoustic channel. Rather than engineering the channel
with subwavelength inclusions, we operate at the cut-off of a higher-order
acoustic mode, demonstrating the realization and efficient excitation of a
zero-compressibility waveguide with effective soft boundaries. We
experimentally verify strong transmission through a largely mismatched channel
and uniform phase distribution, independent of the channel length. Our results
open interesting pathways towards the realization of extreme acoustic
parameters, and their implementation in relevant applications, such as

bulk-edge correspondence principle have been introduced in electronic
insulators and brought into classical systems, featuring with in-gap
corner/hinge states. So far, second-order topological insulators have been
realized in mechanical metamaterials, microwave circuit, topolectrical circuit
and acoustic metamaterials. Here, using near-field scanning measurements, we
show the direct observation of corner states in second-order topological
photonic crystal (PC) slabs consisting of periodic dielectric rods on a perfect
electric conductor (PEC). Based on the generalized two-dimensional (2D)
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, we show that the emergence of corner states
roots in the nonzero edge dipolar polarization instead of the nonzero bulk
quadrupole polarization. We demonstrate the topological transition of 2D Zak
phases of PC slabs by tuning intra-cell distances between two neighboring rods.
We also directly observe in-gap 1D edge states and 0D corner states in the
microwave regime. Our work presents that the PC slab is a powerful platform to
directly observe topological states, and paves the way to study higher-order
photonic topological insulators.

quantum computing. For that purpose we will present a simple model for the
description of the neural network by forming sub-graphs of the whole network
with the same or a similar state. We will describe the interaction between
these areas by closed loops, the feedback loops. The change of the graph is
given by the deformations of the loops. This fact can be mathematically
formalized by the fundamental group of the graph. Furthermore the neuron has
two basic states $|0\rangle$ (ground state) and $|1\rangle$ (excited state).
The whole state of an area of neurons is the linear combination of the two
basic state with complex coefficients representing the signals (with 3
Parameters: amplitude, frequency and phase) along the neurons. Then it can be
shown that the set of all signals forms a manifold (character variety) and all
properties of the network must be encoded in this manifold. In the paper, we
will discuss how to interpret learning and intuition in this model. Using the
Morgan-Shalen compactification, the limit for signals with large amplitude can
be analyzed by using quasi-Fuchsian groups as represented by dessins d'enfants
(graphs to analyze Riemannian surfaces). As shown by Planat and collaborators,
these dessins d'enfants are a direct bridge to (topological) quantum computing
with permutation groups. The normalization of the signal reduces to the group
$SU(2)$ and the whole model to a quantum network. Then we have a direct
connection to quantum circuits. This network can be transformed into operations
on tensor networks. Formally we will obtain a link between machine learning and
Quantum computing.

phonemes in the Persian Consonant-Vowel Combination (PCVC) speech dataset.
Nowadays, deep neural networks play a crucial role in classification tasks.
However, the best results in speech recognition are not yet as perfect as human
recognition rate. Deep learning techniques show outstanding performance over
many other classification tasks like image classification, document
classification, etc. Furthermore, the performance is sometimes better than a
human. The reason why automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are not as
qualified as the human speech recognition system, mostly depends on features of
data which is fed to deep neural networks. Methods: In this research, firstly,
the sound samples are cut for the exact extraction of phoneme sounds in 50ms
samples. Then, phonemes are divided into 30 groups, containing 23 consonants, 6
vowels, and a silence phoneme. Results: The short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
is conducted on them, and the results are given to PPNet (A new deep
convolutional neural network architecture) classifier and a total average of
75.87% accuracy is reached which is the best result ever compared to other
algorithms on separated Persian phonemes (Like in PCVC speech dataset).
Conclusion: This method can be used not only for recognizing mono-phonemes but
also it can be adopted as an input to the selection of the best words in speech
transcription.

the problem of a small training set, the main bottleneck of deep learning, and
apply it for classification of healthy and cancer cells acquired by
quantitative phase imaging. The proposed method, called transferring of
pre-trained generative adversarial network (TOP-GAN), is a hybridization
between transfer learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Healthy
cells and cancer cells of different metastatic potential have been imaged by
low-coherence off-axis holography. After the acquisition, the optical path
delay maps of the cells have been extracted and directly used as an input to
the deep networks. In order to cope with the small number of classified images,
we have used GANs to train a large number of unclassified images from another
cell type (sperm cells). After this preliminary training, and after
transforming the last layer of the network with new ones, we have designed an
automatic classifier for the correct cell type (healthy/primary
cancer/metastatic cancer) with 90-99% accuracy, although small training sets of
down to several images have been used. These results are better in comparison
to other classic methods that aim at coping with the same problem of a small
training set. We believe that our approach makes the combination of holographic
microscopy and deep learning networks more accessible to the medical field by
enabling a rapid, automatic and accurate classification in stain-free imaging
flow cytometry. Furthermore, our approach is expected to be applicable to many
other medical image classification tasks, suffering from a small training set.

a frame in the videos and is usually solved by estimating the density map
generated from the object location annotations. The values in the density map,
by nature, take two possible states: zero indicating no object around, a
non-zero value indicating the existence of objects and the value denoting the
local object density. In contrast to traditional methods which do not
differentiate the density prediction of these two states, we propose to use a
dedicated network branch to predict the object/non-object mask and then combine
its prediction with the input image to produce the density map. Our rationale
is that the mask prediction could be better modeled as a binary segmentation
problem and the difficulty of estimating the density could be reduced if the
mask is known. A key to the proposed scheme is the strategy of incorporating
the mask prediction into the density map estimator. To this end, we study five
possible solutions, and via analysis and experimental validation we identify
the most effective one. Through extensive experiments on five public datasets,
we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over the

conducted by varying one probability value at a time and observing how this
affects output probabilities of interest. When one probability is varied then
others are proportionally covaried to respect the sum-to-one condition of
probability laws. The choice of proportional covariation is justified by a
variety of optimality conditions, under which the original and the varied
distributions are as close as possible under different measures of closeness.
For variations of more than one parameter at a time proportional covariation is
justified in some special cases only. In this work, for the large class of
discrete statistical models entertaining a regular monomial parametrisation, we
demonstrate the optimality of newly defined proportional multi-way schemes with
respect to an optimality criterion based on the notion of I-divergence. We
demonstrate that there are varying parameters choices for which proportional
covariation is not optimal and identify the sub-family of model distributions
where the distance between the original distribution and the one where
probabilities are covaried proportionally is minimum. This is shown by adopting
a new formal, geometric characterization of sensitivity analysis in monomial
models, which include a wide array of probabilistic graphical models. We also
demonstrate the optimality of proportional covariation for multi-way analyses
