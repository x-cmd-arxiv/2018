has invalidated Jaynes-Cummings model and brought quantum Rabi model (QRM) to
more relevance. The QRM only involves linear coupling via a single-photon
process (SPP), while nonlinear two-photon process (TPP) is weaker and
conventionally neglected. However, we find a contrary trend that enhancing the
linear coupling might not suppress more the nonlinear effect but backfire to
trigger some collapse of linear characters. Indeed, in strong SPP couplings a
tiny strength of TPP may dramatically change properties of the system, like a
symmetry spontaneous breaking. By extracting the ground-state phase diagram
including both SPP and TPP, we find TPP in low frequency limit induces a
quantum phase transition with continuity-discontinuity double faces, which
split into two distinct transitions at finite frequencies and yields a triple
point. Our analysis unveils a subtle SPP-TPP entanglement.

$\mathbb{Z}^n \subset \Lambda \subset \mathbb{Q}^n$. Such lattices are called
{\it rational} and can always be obtained by adding $m \le n$ rational vectors
to $\mathbb{Z}^n$. {\it Defect } $d({\cal E},\Lambda)$ of the standard basis $

lattice $\Lambda$ form a basis of $\Lambda$.
  Let $||...||$ be $L^1$-norm on $\mathbb{Q}^n$. Suppose that for each
non-integer $x \in \Lambda$ inequality $||x|| > 1$ holds. Then the unit
octahedron $O^n = \left\{{ x} \in \mathbb{R}^n: ||x|| \leqslant 1\right\}$ is
called admissible with respect to $\Lambda$ and $d({\cal E},\Lambda)$ is also
called defect of the octahedron $O^n$ with respect to $\cal{E}$ and is denoted

  Let $ d_n^m = \max_{\Lambda \in {\cal A}_m} d(O^n_{{\cal E}},\Lambda), $

congested urban traffic. The first shortcoming is related to the determination
of the number of mixture modes, which can change dynamically, within day and
from day to day. The second shortcoming is the wide-spread use of Gaussian
probability densities as mixture components. Gaussian densities fail to capture
the positive skew in travel time distributions and, consequently, large numbers
of mixture components are needed for reasonable fitting accuracy when applied
as mixture components. They also assign positive probabilities to negative
travel times. To address these issues, this paper derives a mixture
distribution with Gamma component densities, which are asymmetric and supported
on the positive numbers. We use sparse estimation techniques to ensure
parsimonious models and propose a generalization of Gamma mixture densities
using Mittag-Leffler functions, which provides enhanced fitting flexibility and
improved parsimony. In order to accommodate within-day variability and allow
for online implementation of the proposed methodology (i.e., fast computations
on streaming travel time data), we introduce a recursive algorithm which
efficiently updates the fitted distribution whenever new data become available.
Experimental results using real-world travel time data illustrate the efficacy
of the proposed methods.

computationally challenging, NP-hard problem. The literature has long
investigated how to perform structure learning from data containing large
numbers of variables, following a general interest in high-dimensional
applications (""small n, large p"") in systems biology and genetics.
  More recently, data sets with large numbers of observations (the so-called
""big data"") have become increasingly common; and these data sets are not
necessarily high-dimensional, sometimes having only a few tens of variables
depending on the application. We revisit the computational complexity of
Bayesian network structure learning in this setting, showing that the common
choice of measuring it with the number of estimated local distributions leads
to unrealistic time complexity estimates for the most common class of
score-based algorithms, greedy search. We then derive more accurate expressions
under common distributional assumptions. These expressions suggest that the
speed of Bayesian network learning can be improved by taking advantage of the
availability of closed form estimators for local distributions with few
parents. Furthermore, we find that using predictive instead of in-sample
goodness-of-fit scores improves speed; and we confirm that is improves the
accuracy of network reconstruction as well, as previously observed by
Chickering and Heckerman (2000). We demonstrate these results on large
real-world environmental and epidemiological data; and on reference data sets

degenerate Hilbert space, the state would acquire a non-Abelian geometric
phase, which is stable and forms the foundation for holonomic quantum
computation (HQC). However, in the adiabatic limit, the environmental
decoherence becomes a significant source of errors. Recently, various
non-adiabatic HQC schemes have been proposed, but all at the price of increased
sensitivity to control errors. Alternatively, there exist theoretical proposals
for speeding up HQC by the technique of ""shortcut to adiabaticity"" (STA), but
no experimental demonstration has been reported so far, as these proprosals
involve a complicated control of four energy levels simultaneously. Here we
propose and experimentally demonstrate that HQC via shortcut to adiabaticity
can be constructed with only three energy levels, using a superconducting qubit
in a scalable architecture. With this scheme, all holonomic single-qubit
operations can be realized non-adiabatically through a single cycle of state
evolution. As a result, we are able to experimentally benchmark the stability
of STA+HQC against NHQC in the same platform. The flexibility and simplicity of
our scheme makes it also implementable on other systems, such as

of variants, is now well studied. In this paper, we begin a local analysis of
this notion by introducing $cdim_G(v)$, \emph{the connected metric dimension of
$G$ at a vertex $v$}, which is defined as follows: a set of vertices $S$ of $G$
is a \emph{resolving set} if, for any pair of distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ of
$G$, there is a vertex $z \in S$ such that the distance between $z$ and $x$ is
distinct from the distance between $z$ and $y$ in $G$. We call a resolving set
$S$ \emph{connected} if $S$ induces a connected subgraph of $G$. Then,
$cdim_G(v)$ is defined to be the minimum of the cardinalities of all connected
resolving sets which contain the vertex $v$. The \emph{connected metric
dimension of $G$}, denoted by $cdim(G)$, is $\min\{cdim_G(v): v \in V(G)\}$.
Noting that $1 \le dim(G) \le cdim(G) \le cdim_G(v) \le |V(G)|-1$ for any
vertex $v$ of $G$, we show the existence of a pair $(G,v)$ such that
$cdim_G(v)$ takes all positive integer values from $dim(G)$ to $|V (G)|-1$, as
$v$ varies in a fixed graph $G$. We characterize graphs $G$ and their vertices
$v$ satisfying $cdim_G(v) \in \{1, |V(G)|-1\}$. We show that $cdim(G)=2$
implies $G$ is planar, whereas it is well known that there is a non-planar
graph $H$ with $dim(H)=2$. We also characterize trees and unicyclic graphs $G$
satisfying $cdim(G)=dim(G)$. We show that $cdim(G)-dim(G)$ can be arbitrarily
large. We determine $cdim(G)$ and $cdim_G(v)$ for some classes of graphs. We
further examine the effect of vertex or edge deletion on the connected metric
dimension. We conclude with some open problems.

using backpropagation. Huge amounts of labeled examples are required, but the
resulting classification accuracy is truly impressive, sometimes outperforming
humans. Neurons in an ANN are characterized by a single, static,
continuous-valued activation. Yet biological neurons use discrete spikes to
compute and transmit information, and the spike times, in addition to the spike
rates, matter. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are thus more biologically
realistic than ANNs, and arguably the only viable option if one wants to
understand how the brain computes. SNNs are also more hardware friendly and
energy-efficient than ANNs, and are thus appealing for technology, especially
for portable devices. However, training deep SNNs remains a challenge. Spiking
neurons' transfer function is usually non-differentiable, which prevents using
backpropagation. Here we review recent supervised and unsupervised methods to
train deep SNNs, and compare them in terms of accuracy, but also computational
cost and hardware friendliness. The emerging picture is that SNNs still lag
behind ANNs in terms of accuracy, but the gap is decreasing, and can even
vanish on some tasks, while the SNNs typically require much fewer operations.

cross-validation, we show that segments of the local connectome are predictive
of certain patterns of functional brain dynamics. These results are consistent
with the hypothesis that structural variability along axon bundles constrains

expansion and the Fourier levels of the Boolean hypercube for simplicial
complexes. Our analog is a decomposition into approximate eigenspaces of random

the decomposition have the additional advantage that they extend to the more

  We then use this decomposition to extend the Friedgut-Kalai-Naor theorem to
high-dimensional expanders. Our results demonstrate that a constant-degree
high-dimensional expander can sometimes serve as a sparse model for the Boolean

the predictivity of coarse-grained models in molecular dynamics simulations and
providing a rigorous justification of their use, through a combination of
theoretical studies and data-driven approaches. One of the most promising
research effort is the (re-)discovery of the Mori-Zwanzig projection as a
generic, yet systematic, theoretical tool for deriving coarse-grained models.
Despite its clean mathematical formulation and generality, there are still many
open questions about its applicability and assumptions.
  In this work, we propose a detailed derivation of a hybrid multi-scale
system, generalising and further investigating the approach developed in
[Espa\~{n}ol, P., EPL, 88, 40008 (2009)]. Issues such as the general
co-existence of atoms (fully-resolved degrees of freedom) and beads (larger
coarse-grained units), the role of the fine-to-coarse mapping chosen, and the
approximation of effective potentials are discussed. The concept of an
approximate projection is introduced along with a discussion of its use as
measure of the error committed with the approximation of the true interactions
among the beads. The theoretical discussion is supported by numerical
simulations of a monodimensional non-linear periodic benchmark system with an
open-source parallel Julia code, easily extensible to arbitrary potential
models and fine-to-coarse mapping functions.
  The results presented highlight the importance of introducing, in the
macroscopic model, a non-constant dissipative term, given by the Mori-Zwanzig
approach, to correctly reproduce the reference fine-grained results without
requiring \emph{ad-hoc} calibration of interaction potentials and thermostats.

investigated. The rattleback is a toy with some curious properties. When placed
on a surface with reasonable friction, the rattleback has a preferred direction
of spin. If rotated anti to it, longitudinal vibrations are set up and spin
direction is reversed.
  In this paper, the dynamics of a rattleback placed on a sinusoidally
vibrating platform are simulated. We can expect base vibrations to excite the
pitch motion of the rattleback, which, because of the coupling between pitch
and spin motion, should cause the rattleback to spin. Results are presented
which show that this indeed is the case- the rattleback has a mono-peak spin
resonance with respect to base vibrations. The rattleback, thus, transduces
translating vibrations into continuous rotary motion and, therefore, is ideal
for applications in Energy harvesting and Vibration sensing.
  The dynamic response of the rattleback was found to be composed of two
principal frequencies that appeared in the pitch and rolling motions. One of
the frequencies was found to have a large coupling with the spin of the
rattleback. Spin resonance was found to occur when the base oscillatory
frequency was twice the value of the coupled frequency. A linearized model is
developed which can predict the values of the two frequencies accurately and
analytical expressions for the same in terms of the parameters of the
rattleback have been derived. The analysis, thus, forms an effective and easy
method for obtaining the spin resonant frequency of a given rattleback.
  Novel ideas for applications utilizing the phenomenon of spin resonance, for
example, an energy harvester composed of a magnetized rattleback surrounded by
ferromagnetic walls and a small scale vibration sensor comprising an array of
several magnetized rattlebacks, are included.

presents a challenge for many music information retrieval (MIR) systems;
ideally, perceptually similar rhythms should be represented and processed
similarly, regardless of the specific tempo at which they were performed.
Several recent systems for tempo estimation, beat tracking, and downbeat
tracking have therefore sought to process rhythm in a tempo-invariant way,
often by sampling input vectors according to a precomputed pulse level. This
paper describes how a log-frequency representation of rhythm-related
activations instead can promote tempo invariance when processed with
convolutional neural networks. The strategy incorporates invariance at a
fundamental level and can be useful for most tasks related to rhythm
processing. Different methods are described, relying on magnitude, phase
relationships of different rhythm channels, as well as raw phase information.
Several variations are explored to provide direction for future
implementations.

  Localization Outage Probability","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In localization, an outage occurs if the positioning error exceeds a
pre-defined threshold, $\epsilon_{\rm th}$. For time-of-arrival based
localization, a key factor affecting the positioning error is the relative
positions of the anchors, with respect to the target location. Specifically,
the positioning error is a function of (a) the distance-dependent
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the anchor-target links, and (b) the pairwise
angles subtended by the anchors at the target location. From a design
perspective, characterizing the distribution of the positioning error over an
ensemble of target and anchor locations is essential for providing
probabilistic performance guarantees against outage. To solve this difficult
problem, previous works have assumed all links to have the same SNR (i.e., SNR
homogeneity), which neglects the impact of distance variation among the anchors
on the positioning error. In this paper, we model SNR heterogeneity among
anchors using a distance-dependent pathloss model and derive an accurate
approximation for the error complementary cumulative distribution function
(ccdf). By highlighting the accuracy of our results, relative to previous ones
that ignore SNR heterogeneity, we concretely demonstrate that SNR heterogeneity
has a considerable impact on the error distribution.

theory for weak and the harmonic approximation (HA) for strong interactions.
Diffusion Monte Carlo method is used to obtain the ground-state properties in a

the interaction strength and construct a Pad\'e approximant which fits the
numerical data and reproduces correctly the asymptotic limits of weak and

peculiarity of the system is that by changing the density it is not possible to
induce the phase transition. We show that the low-lying excitation spectrum

In this
paper, we improve the local search algorithms for solving the Maximum Weight
Clique (MWC) problem by introducing new tabu and restart strategies. Both the
tabu and restart strategies proposed are based on the notion of a local search
scenario, which involves not only a candidate solution but also the tabu status
and unlocking relationship. Compared to the strategy of configuration checking,
our tabu mechanism discourages forming a cycle of unlocking operations. Our new
restart strategy is based on the re-occurrence of a local search scenario
instead of that of a candidate solution. Experimental results show that the
resulting MWC solver outperforms several state-of-the-art solvers on the
DIMACS, BHOSLIB, and two benchmarks from practical applications.

solutions again have infinite energy, and give an example of regularity
breakdown. Then, using a variant of the Hasimoto transformation applied to our

will show that the Schwarzschild metric does not satisfy the boundary condition

the infrared all the way up to the ultraviolet regime, in concurrence with the

network with no explicit linguistic features. However, prior work has shown
that gold syntax trees can dramatically improve SRL decoding, suggesting the
possibility of increased accuracy from explicit modeling of syntax. In this
work, we present linguistically-informed self-attention (LISA): a neural
network model that combines multi-head self-attention with multi-task learning
across dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, predicate detection and SRL.
Unlike previous models which require significant pre-processing to prepare
linguistic features, LISA can incorporate syntax using merely raw tokens as
input, encoding the sequence only once to simultaneously perform parsing,
predicate detection and role labeling for all predicates. Syntax is
incorporated by training one attention head to attend to syntactic parents for
each token. Moreover, if a high-quality syntactic parse is already available,
it can be beneficially injected at test time without re-training our SRL model.
In experiments on CoNLL-2005 SRL, LISA achieves new state-of-the-art
performance for a model using predicted predicates and standard word

discovery of `Oumuamua is so high ($\sim 0.2$~au$^{-3}$) that Pop.~III
survivors have chances at colliding with ISOs $\gtrsim 10^5$ times per $1$~Gyr.
`Oumuamua itself would be sublimated near Pop.~III survivors, since it has
small size, $\sim 100$~m. However, ISOs with size $\gtrsim 3$~km would reach
the Pop.~III survivor surfaces. Supposing an ISO cumulative number density with
size larger than $D$ is $n \propto D^{-\alpha}$, Pop.~III survivors can accrete
ISO mass $\gtrsim 10^{-16}M_\odot$, or ISO iron mass $\gtrsim 10^{-17}M_\odot$,
if $\alpha < 4$. This iron mass is larger than the accretion mass of
interstellar medium (ISM) by several orders of magnitude. Taking into account
material mixing in a convection zone of Pop.~III survivors, we obtain their
surface pollution is typically [Fe/H] $\lesssim -8$ in most cases, however the
surface pollution of Pop.~III survivors with $0.8M_\odot$ can be [Fe/H]
$\gtrsim -6$ because of the very shallow convective layer. If we apply to
Pop.III survivors located at the Galactocentric distance of 8 kpc, the
dependence of the metal pollustion is as follows. If $\alpha > 4$, Pop.~III
survivors have no chance at colliding with ISOs with $D \gtrsim 3$~km, and keep
metal-free. If $3 < \alpha < 4$, Pop.~III survivors would be most polluted by
ISOs up to [Fe/H] $\sim -7$. If $\alpha < 3$ up to $D \sim 10$~km, Pop.~III
survivors could hide in metal-poor stars so far discovered. Pop.~III survivors
would be more polluted with decreasing the Galactocentric distance. Although
the metal pollution depends on $\alpha$ and the Galactocentric distance, we
first show the importance of ISOs for the metal pollution of Pop.~III
survivors.

proposed for high performance visual tracking, it not only possesses the
powerful discriminative capability of SOSVM but also efficiently inherits the
superior computational efficiency of DCF. Based on the proposed circular and
structural operators, a set of primal confidence score maps can be obtained by
circular correlating feature maps with their corresponding structural
correlation filters. Furthermore, an implicit interpolation is applied to
convert the multi-resolution feature maps to the continuous domain and make all
primal confidence score maps have the same spatial resolution. Then, we exploit
an efficient ensemble post-processor based on relative entropy, which can
coalesce primal confidence score maps and create an optimal confidence score
map for more accurate localization. The target is localized on the peak of the
optimal confidence score map. Besides, we introduce a collaborative
optimization strategy to update circular and structural operators by
iteratively training structural correlation filters, which significantly
reduces computational complexity and improves robustness. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in mean AUC
scores of 71.5% and 69.4% on the OTB-2013 and OTB-2015 benchmarks respectively,

guaranteed performance is challenging. Moreover, a tool is needed to handle
sophisticated specifications from grid codes and protection relays. This paper
proposes a model predictive control (MPC)-based mode synthesis methodology,
which can accommodate the temporal logic specifications (TLSs). The TLSs allow
richer descriptions of control specifications addressing both magnitude and
time at the same time. The proposed controller will compute a series of Boolean
control signals to synthesize the GS mode of DERs by solving the MPC problem
under the normal condition, where the frequency response predicted by a
reduced-order model satisfies the defined specifications. Once a sizable
disturbance is detected, the pre-calculated signals are applied to the DERs.
The proposed synthesis methodology is verified on the full nonlinear model in
Simulink. A robust factor is imposed on the specifications to compensate the
response mismatch between the reduce-order model and nonlinear model so that
the nonlinear response satisfies the required TLS.

this, we consider a spatial equilibrium model of price formation, where
constraints on inter-regional flows result in three distinct equilibria in
prices. We use this to motivate an econometric model for the distribution of
observed electricity spot prices that captures many of their unique empirical
characteristics. The econometric model features supply and inter-regional trade
cost functions, which are estimated using Bayesian monotonic regression
smoothing methodology. A copula multivariate time series model is employed to
capture additional dependence -- both cross-sectional and serial-- in regional
prices. The marginal distributions are nonparametric, with means given by the
regression means. The model has the advantage of preserving the heavy
right-hand tail in the predictive densities of price. We fit the model to
half-hourly spot price data in the five interconnected regions of the
Australian national electricity market. The fitted model is then used to
measure how both supply and price shocks in one region are transmitted to the
distribution of prices in all regions in subsequent periods. Finally, to
validate our econometric model, we show that prices forecast using the proposed
model compare favorably with those from some benchmark alternatives.

propagation and scattering in structures that are piece-wise uniform along one
spatial direction. For open structures that are unbounded in transverse
directions (perpendicular to the uniform direction), the NMM methods use the
perfectly matched layer (PML) technique to truncate the transverse variables.
When incident waves are specified in homogeneous media surrounding the main
structure, the total field is not always outgoing, and the NMM methods rely on
reference solutions for each uniform segment. Existing NMM methods have
difficulty handing gracing incident waves and special incident waves related to
the onset of total internal reflection, and are not very efficient at computing
reference solutions for non-plane incident waves. In this paper, a new NMM
method is developed to overcome these limitations. A Robin-type boundary
condition is proposed to ensure that non-propagating and non-decaying wave
field components are not reflected by truncated PMLs. Exponential convergence
of the PML solutions based on the hybrid Dirichlet-Robin boundary condition is
established theoretically. A fast method is developed for computing reference
solutions for cylindrical incident waves. The new NMM is implemented for
two-dimensional structures and polarized electromagnetic waves. Numerical
experiments are carried out to validate the new NMM method and to demonstrate
its performance.

extend the UD guidelines to cover special constructions in tweets that affect
tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and labeled dependencies. Using the
extended guidelines, we create a new tweet treebank for English (Tweebank v2)
that is four times larger than the (unlabeled) Tweebank v1 introduced by Kong
et al. (2014). We characterize the disagreements between our annotators and
show that it is challenging to deliver consistent annotation due to ambiguity
in understanding and explaining tweets. Nonetheless, using the new treebank, we
build a pipeline system to parse raw tweets into UD. To overcome annotation
noise without sacrificing computational efficiency, we propose a new method to
distill an ensemble of 20 transition-based parsers into a single one. Our
parser achieves an improvement of 2.2 in LAS over the un-ensembled baseline and
outperforms parsers that are state-of-the-art on other treebanks in both
accuracy and speed.

  ASP-based Systems",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Robots need task planning algorithms to sequence actions toward accomplishing
goals that are impossible through individual actions. Off-the-shelf task
planners can be used by intelligent robotics practitioners to solve a variety
of planning problems. However, many different planners exist, each with
different strengths and weaknesses, and there are no general rules for which
planner would be best to apply to a given problem.
  In this article, we empirically compare the performance of state-of-the-art
planners that use either the Planning Domain Description Language (PDDL), or
Answer Set Programming (ASP) as the underlying action language. PDDL is
designed for task planning, and PDDL-based planners are widely used for a
variety of planning problems. ASP is designed for knowledge-intensive
reasoning, but can also be used for solving task planning problems. Given
domain encodings that are as similar as possible, we find that PDDL-based
planners perform better on problems with longer solutions, and ASP-based
planners are better on tasks with a large number of objects or in which complex
reasoning is required to reason about action preconditions and effects. The
resulting analysis can inform selection among general purpose planning systems
for particular robot task planning domains.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this paper develops a method to improve
the coupling between the convolution layer and the FC layer by reducing the
noise in Feature Maps (FMs). Our approach is divided into three steps. Firstly,
we separate all the FMs into n blocks equally. Then, the weighted summation of
FMs at the same position in all blocks constitutes a new block of FMs. Finally,
we replicate this new block into n copies and concatenate them as the input to
the FC layer. This sharing of FMs could reduce the noise in them apparently and
avert the impact by a particular FM on the specific part weight of hidden
layers, hence preventing the network from overfitting to some extent. Using the
Fermat Lemma, we prove that this method could make the global minima value
range of the loss function wider, by which makes it easier for neural networks
to converge and accelerates the convergence process. This method does not
significantly increase the amounts of network parameters (only a few more
coefficients added), and the experiments demonstrate that this method could
increase the convergence speed and improve the classification performance of
neural networks.

appropriate reviews based on the podsolization consisting is very important
since it relies on using such micro-reviews consistency to evaluate the review
set section. Micro-reviews are very concise and directly talk about product or

help in choosing reviews based on their personalized consistency that is
related to directly or indirectly to the main profile of the reviews.
Personalized reviews selection that is highly relevant with high personalized
coverage in terms of matching with micro-reviews is the main problem that is
considered in this paper. Furthermore, personalization with user preferences
while making review selection is also considered based on the personalized

personalized review selection using micro-reviews based on the proposed
evaluation metric approach which considering two main factors (personalized

is proposed which makes use of multiple similarity measures merged to have
highly efficient personalized reviews matching function for selection. The
experimental results based on using reviews dataset which is collected from

the personalized reviews selection is a very empirical case of study.

recoloring moves whose goal is to produce a monochromatic (""flooded"") graph as
quickly as possible. Their difference is that in Free-Flood-It the player has
the additional freedom of choosing the vertex to play in each move. In this
paper, we investigate how this freedom affects the complexity of the problem.
It turns out that the freedom is bad in some sense. We show that some cases
trivially solvable for Fixed-Flood-It become intractable for Free-Flood-It. We
also show that some tractable cases for Fixed-Flood-It are still tractable for
Free-Flood-It but need considerably more involved arguments. We finally present
some combinatorial properties connecting or separating the two problems. In
particular, we show that the length of an optimal solution for Fixed-Flood-It
is always at most twice that of Free-Flood-It, and this is tight.

linear combination of two hyperplanes from $H$; in particular, if all
hyperplanes in $H$ are $k$-sparse then generalized comparisons are $2k$-sparse.
The depth of the obtained linear decision tree is polynomial in $d$ and
logarithmic in $|H|$, which is comparable to previous results in the literature
that use general linear queries.
  This extends the study of comparison trees from a previous work by the

conducted with IRAM 30 m and NRO 45 m telescope. Multiple lines of C2H, c-C3H2
and CH3OH have been observed to characterize the chemical composition averaged
over a 1000 au scale around the protostar. The derived beam-averaged column
densities show significant chemical diversity among the sources, where the
column density ratios of C2H/CH3OH are spread out by 2 orders of magnitude.
From previous studies, the hot corino sources have abundant CH3OH but deficient
C2H, their C2H/CH3OH column density ratios being relatively low. In contrast,
the warm-carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC) sources are found to reveal the high
C2H/CH3OH column density ratios. We find that the majority of the sources have
intermediate characters between these two distinct chemistry types. A possible
trend is seen between the C2H/CH3OH ratio and the distance of the source from
the edge of a molecular cloud. The sources located near cloud edges or in
isolated clouds tend to have a high C2H/CH3OH ratio. On the other hand, the
sources having a low C2H/CH3OH ratio tend to be located in inner regions of the

sources will be fundamentally limited by the calibration uncertainties of the
detectors in upcoming observation runs with the increased number of source
statistics. Photon calibrators have so far been the primary tools for absolute
calibration of test-mass displacement, relying on measurement of the photon
pressure. The current technological limit of the absolute calibration
uncertainty for gravitational-wave amplitudes is limited to a few percent, due
to the uncertainty in the laser power-standard maintained by the metrology
institutes. To reduce this uncertainty, this article proposes a novel
calibration method that combines a photon calibrator and a gravity field
calibrator. The gravity field calibrator achieves modulation of the
displacement of the test mass by generating a gravity gradient. In previous
studies, uncertainty in the distance between the test mass and the gravity
field calibrator has proven a serious source of systematic error. To suppress
this uncertainty, we propose a novel method that uses a combination of
quadrupole and hexapole mass distributions in the gravity field calibrator. We
estimate the absolute uncertainty associated with method to be as low as
0.17~%, which is ten times less than that of previous methods.

states in the form of a fluctuation-response inequality (FRI). We study the
response of an observable to a perturbation of the underlying stochastic
dynamics. We find that magnitude of the response is bounded from above by the
fluctuations of the observable in the unperturbed system and the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the probability densities describing the
perturbed and unperturbed system. This establishes a connection between linear
response and concepts of information theory. We show that in many physical
situations, the relative entropy may be expressed in terms of physical
observables. As a direct consequence of this FRI, we show that for steady state
particle transport, the differential mobility is bounded by the diffusivity.
For a virtual perturbation proportional to the local mean velocity, we recover
the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) for steady state transport
processes. Finally, we use the FRI to derive a generalization of the
uncertainty relation to arbitrary dynamics, which involves higher-order
cumulants of the observable. We provide an explicit example, in which the TUR
is violated but its generalization is satisfied with equality.

evidence of optical pumping polarisation and it rules out the scattering
polarisation from free electrons of the circumbinary environment.} In the

dynamical mean-field theory. The results are analyzed using a generalized
tunneling formula for the current, which is reminiscent of the Meir-Wingreen
formula and provides insights into the relevant physical processes. In the DC
case, the spectrum of the NESSs exhibits Wannier-Stark (WS) states associated
with the lower and upper Hubbard bands. In addition, there emerge WS sidebands
from many-body states. Using the tunneling formula, we demonstrate that the
tunneling between these WS states leads to peaks or humps in the induced DC
current. In the AC case, we cover a wide parameter range of excitation
frequencies and field strengths to clarify the crossover from field-induced
tunneling behavior in the DC limit to nonequilibrium states dominated by
multiphoton absorption in the AC limit. In the crossover regime, the
single-particle spectrum is characterized by a coexistence of Floquet sidebands
and WS peaks, and the current and double occupation exhibits a nontrivial
dependence on the field strength. The tunneling formula works quantitatively
well even in the AC case, and we use it to discuss the potential cooperation of
tunneling and multi-photon processes in the crossover regime. The tunneling
formula and its simplified versions also provide physical insights into the
high-harmonic generation in Mott insulators.

discriminating between real and fake frames and aligning frames with the
conditioning caption, and motion discriminator emphasizing the philosophy that
the adjacent frames in the generated videos should be smoothly connected as in

formulate an equivalent local potential that reproduces the coupled-channel
scattering amplitudes resulting from chiral SU(3)_L times SU(3)_R meson-baryon
effective field theory. In contrast to a previously constructed effective
single-channel Kbar N potential, the explicit treatment of the pi Sigma channel
yields a natural description of the low-mass pole as part of the two-pole
structure of the Lambda(1405) resonance. The energy dependence of the potential
can now be parametrized with a minimum of polynomial orders. To study the
properties of the Lambda(1405) as a quantum-mechanical quasibound state, we
derive the normalization condition of its wave function generated by the
energy-dependent coupled-channel potential, using the Feshbach projection
method. This framework provides an improved understanding of this system from
the viewpoint of the compositeness of hadrons. With the properly normalized
wave function, we demonstrate and confirm that the high-mass pole of the
Lambda(1405) is dominated by the Kbar N component.

complex geometries in Computer Aided Design tools, and have gained a lot of
popularity in recent years also for the approximation of partial differential
equations, via the Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) paradigm. However, spectral
accuracy in IGA is limited to relatively small NURBS patch degrees (roughly p
<= 8), since local condition numbers grow very rapidly for higher degrees. On
the other hand, traditional Spectral Element Methods (SEM) guarantee spectral
accuracy but often require complex and expensive meshing techniques, like
transfinite mapping, that result anyway in inexact geometries. In this work we
propose a hybrid NURBS-SEM approximation method that achieves spectral accuracy
and maintains exact geometry representation by combining the advantages of IGA

  As a prototypical problem on non trivial geometries, we consider the
Laplace--Beltrami and Allen--Cahn equations on a surface. On these problems, we

large-scale image retrieval tasks. Recent research has shown that leveraging
supervised information can lead to high quality hashing. However, the cost of
annotating data is often an obstacle when applying supervised hashing to a new
domain. Moreover, the results can suffer from the robustness problem as the
data at training and test stage could come from similar but different
distributions. This paper studies the exploration of generating synthetic data
through semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (GANs), which leverages
largely unlabeled and limited labeled training data to produce highly
compelling data with intrinsic invariance and global coherence, for better
understanding statistical structures of natural data. We demonstrate that the
above two limitations can be well mitigated by applying the synthetic data for
hashing. Specifically, a novel deep semantic hashing with GANs (DSH-GANs) is
presented, which mainly consists of four components: a deep convolution neural
networks (CNN) for learning image representations, an adversary stream to
distinguish synthetic images from real ones, a hash stream for encoding image
representations to hash codes and a classification stream. The whole
architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing three losses, i.e.,
adversarial loss to correct label of synthetic or real for each sample, triplet
ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input
real-synthetic triplets and classification loss to classify each sample
accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE image
benchmarks validate the capability of exploiting synthetic images for hashing.
Our framework also achieves superior results when compared to state-of-the-art

  Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) for publication",,,,"cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Traffic-related pollution is becoming a major societal problem globally.
Cyclists are particularly exposed to this form of pollution due to their
proximity to vehicles' tailpipes. In a number of recent studies, it is been
shown that exposure to this form of pollution eventually outweighs the
cardio-vascular benefits associated with cycling. Hence during cycling there
are conflicting effects that affect the cyclist. On the one hand, cycling
effort gives rise to health benefits, whereas exposure to pollution clearly
does not. Mathematically speaking, these conflicting effects give rise to
convex utility functions that describe the health threats accrued to cyclists.
More particularly, and roughly speaking, for a given level of background
pollution, there is an optimal length of journey time that minimises the health
risks to a cyclist. In this paper, we consider a group of cyclists that share a
common route. This may be recreational cyclists, or cyclists that travel
together from an origin to destination. Given this context, we ask the
following question. What is the common speed at which the cyclists should
travel, so that the overall health risks can be minimised? We formulate this as
an optimisation problem with consensus constraints. More specifically, we
design an intelligent speed advisory system that recommends a common speed to a
group of cyclists taking into account different levels of fitness of the
cycling group, or different levels of electric assist in the case that some or
all cyclists use e-bikes (electric bikes). To do this, we extend a recently
derived consensus result to the case of quasi-convex utility functions.
Simulation studies in different scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of our
proposed system.

particularly important today since cloud services become increasingly common

identify sources of this discrepancy. We numerically relate the volume fraction

performed in the elastic response regime close to the jamming transition and
with very small amplitudes to calculate the scaling exponents, these conditions

extremely complex to monitor, operate and control. Furthermore, for the real

distribution state estimation (DSE). Forecasting aided state estimator (FASE),
deploys measured data in consecutive time samples to refine the state estimate.
Although most of the DSE algorithms deal with real and imaginary parts of
distribution networks states independently, we propose a non iterative complex
DSE algorithm based on augmented complex Kalman filter (ACKF) which considers
the states as complex values. In case of real time DSE and in presence of a
large number of customer loads in the system, employing DSEs in one single
estimation layer is not computationally efficient. Consequently, our proposed
method performs in several estimation layers hierarchically as a Multi layer
DSE using ACKF (DSEMACKF). In the proposed method, a distribution network can
be divided into one main area and several subareas. The aggregated loads in
each subarea act like a big customer load in the main area. Load aggregation
results in a lower variability and higher cross correlation. This increases the
accuracy of the estimated states. Additionally, the proposed method is
formulated to include unbalanced loads in low voltage (LV) distribution
network.

field. Previous measurements reported on negligible convective flows in umbral
cores. Based on this, numerous studies have taken the umbra as zero reference
to calculate Doppler velocities of the ambient active region. To clarify the
amount of convective motion in the darkest part of umbrae, we directly measured
Doppler velocities with an unprecedented accuracy and precision. We performed
spectroscopic observations of sunspot umbrae with the Laser Absolute Reference
Spectrograph (LARS) at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope. A laser frequency
comb enabled the calibration of the high-resolution spectrograph and absolute
wavelength positions. A thorough spectral calibration, including the
measurement of the reference wavelength, yielded Doppler shifts of the spectral
line Ti i 5713.9 {\AA} with an uncertainty of around 5 m s-1. The measured
Doppler shifts are a composition of umbral convection and magneto-acoustic
waves. For the analysis of convective shifts, we temporally average each
sequence to reduce the superimposed wave signal. Compared to convective
blueshifts of up to -350 m s-1 in the quiet Sun, sunspot umbrae yield a
strongly reduced convective blueshifts around -30 m s-1. {W}e find that the
velocity in a sunspot umbra correlates significantly with the magnetic field
strength, but also with the umbral temperature defining the depth of the
titanium line. The vertical upward motion decreases with increasing field
strength. Extrapolating the linear approximation to zero magnetic field
reproduces the measured quiet Sun blueshift. Simply taking the sunspot umbra as
a zero velocity reference for the calculation of photospheric Dopplergrams can
imply a systematic velocity error.

between the final-state fermion and DM, the degree of polarization at the mass
threshold can reach $70\%$ or even higher, providing us with a new tool for
probing the nature of dark matter in future gamma-ray polarization experiments.

then map them using bilingual dictionaries. In this work, we present a novel
method to learn bilingual embeddings based on multilingual knowledge bases (KB)

wordnets via random walks and learns a joint embedding space in one go. We
further reinforce cross-lingual equivalence adding bilingual con- straints in

cross-lingual word similarity and relatedness datasets in six lan- guage pairs

on their own improve over text-based systems in similarity datasets; 3) the
good results are consistent for large wordnets (e.g. English, Spanish), smaller

\emph{non-preemptively} so as to minimize the weighted flow-time on a set of
unrelated machines. There has been a considerable amount of work on this
problem in the preemptive setting where several competitive algorithms are
known in the classical competitive model. %Using the speed augmentation model,
Anand et al. showed that the greedy algorithm is
$O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$-competitive in the preemptive setting. In
the non-preemptive setting, Lucarelli et al. showed that there exists a strong
lower bound for minimizing weighted flow-time even on a single machine.
However, the problem in the non-preemptive setting admits a strong lower bound.
Recently, Lucarelli et al. presented an algorithm that achieves a
$O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\right)$-competitive ratio when the algorithm is
allowed to reject $\epsilon$-fraction of total weight of jobs and
$\epsilon$-speed augmentation. They further showed that speed augmentation
alone is insufficient to derive any competitive algorithm. An intriguing open
question is whether there exists a scalable competitive algorithm that rejects
a small fraction of total weights.
  In this paper, we affirmatively answer this question. Specifically, we show
that there exists a $O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^3}\right)$-competitive algorithm
for minimizing weighted flow-time on a set of unrelated machine that rejects at
most $O(\epsilon)$-fraction of total weight of jobs. The design and analysis of
the algorithm is based on the primal-dual technique. Our result asserts that
alternative models beyond speed augmentation should be explored when designing
online schedulers in the non-preemptive setting in an effort to find provably
good algorithms.

requires observations of huge numbers of stars. Stellar photometry, therefore,
provides an economical method to obtain intrinsic stellar parameters. With the
addition of distance information - deriving reliable ages from photometry is a
possibility. We have developed a Bayesian method that generates 2D probability
maps of a star's age and metallicity from photometry and parallax using
isochrones. Our synthetic tests show that including a near-UV passband enables
us to break the degeneracy between a star's age and metallicity for certain
evolutionary stages. It is possible to find well-constrained ages and
metallicities for turn-off and sub-giant stars with colours including a U band
and a parallax with uncertainty less than ~20%. Metallicities alone are
possible for the main sequence and giant branch. We find good agreement with
the literature when we apply our method to the Gaia benchmark stars,
particularly for turn-off and young stars. Further tests on the old open
cluster NGC 188, however, reveal significant limitations in the stellar
isochrones. The ages derived for the cluster stars vary with evolutionary
stage, such that turn-off ages disagree with those on the sub-giant branch, and
metallicities vary significantly throughout. Furthermore, the parameters vary
appreciably depending on which colour combinations are used in the derivation.
We identify the causes of these mismatches and show that improvements are
needed in the modelling of giant branch stars and in the creation and
calibration of synthetic near-UV photometry. Our results warn against applying
isochrone fitting indiscriminately. In particular, the uncertainty on the
stellar models should be quantitatively taken into account. Further efforts to
improve the models will result in significant advancements in our ability to
study the Galaxy.

aggregates decreases, keeping characteristic radius of the aggregates ($R_c$)
same for all structures, there is an enhancement in the negative polarization
branch (NPB) which is accompanied by a substantial increase in the anisotropies
present in the material. Also at the exact backscattering region, the
anisotropies are found to be linearly correlated with the porosity of the

strongly correlated with the associated anisotropies. Finally, we put forward a

System's architecture is still an open problem. Detailed study of multiplicity
and architecture is generally hampered by limitations in quality, temporal
extension and observing strategy, causing difficulties in detecting low-mass
inner planets in the presence of outer giant planetary bodies.
  We present the results of high-cadence and high-precision HARPS observations
on 20 solar-type stars known to host a single long-period giant planet in order
to search for additional inner companions and estimate the occurence rate $f_p$
of scaled Solar System analogs, i.e. systems featuring lower-mass inner planets
in the presence of long-period giant planets.
  We carry out combined fits of our HARPS data with literature radial
velocities using differential evolution MCMC to refine the literature orbital
solutions and search for additional inner planets. We then derive the survey
detection limits to provide preliminary estimates of $f_p$.
  We generally find better constrained orbital parameters for the known planets
than those found in the literature. While no additional inner planet is
detected, we find evidence for previously unreported long-period massive
companions in systems HD 50499 and HD 73267. We finally estimate the frequency
of inner low mass (10-30 M$_\oplus$) planets in the presence of outer giant
planets as $f_p<9.84\%$ for P<150 days.
  Our preliminary estimate of $f_p$ is significantly lower than the values
found in the literature; the lack of inner candidate planets found in our
sample can also be seen as evidence corroborating the inward migration
formation model for super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Our results also underline
the need for high-cadence and high-precision follow-up observations as the key
to precisely determine the occurence of Solar System analogs.

access framework for downlink multi-antenna systems, and contains
Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)
as special cases. RSMA relies on linearly precoded rate-splitting with
Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) to decode part of the interference
and treat the remaining part of the interference as noise. Recently, RSMA has
been shown to outperform both SDMA and NOMA rate-wise in a wide range of
network loads (underloaded and overloaded regimes) and user deployments (with a
diversity of channel directions, channel strengths and qualities of Channel
State Information at the Transmitter). Moreover, RSMA was shown to provide
spectral efficiency and QoS enhancements over NOMA at a lower computational
complexity for the transmit scheduler and the receivers. In this paper, we
build upon those results and investigate the energy efficiency of RSMA compared
to SDMA and NOMA. Considering a multiple-input single-output broadcast channel,
we show that RSMA is more energy-efficient than SDMA and NOMA in a wide range
of user deployments (with a diversity of channel directions and channel
strengths). We conclude that RSMA is more spectrally and energy-efficient than
SDMA and NOMA.

two-dimensional autonomous system, can produce chaotic responses with sensitive
dependence on initial conditions if the forcing induces sufficient stretching
and folding of the phase space. Quasiperiodic forcing can similarly produce
chaotic responses, where the transition to chaos on changing a parameter can
bring the system into regions of strange non-chaotic behaviour. Although it is
generally acknowledged that the timings of Pleistocene ice ages are at least
partly due to Milankovitch forcing (which may be approximated as quasiperiodic,
with energy concentrated near a small number of frequencies), the precise
details of what can be inferred about the timings of glaciations and
deglaciations from the forcing is still unclear. In this paper, we perform a
quantitative comparison of the response of several low-order nonlinear
conceptual models for these ice ages to various types of quasiperiodic forcing.
By computing largest Lyapunov exponents and mean periods, we demonstrate that
many models can have a chaotic response to quasiperiodic forcing for a range of
forcing amplitudes, even though some of the simplest conceptual models do not.
These results suggest that pacing of ice ages to forcing may have only limited
determinism.

for training high-performance ML models while preserving client privacy. Toward
this future goal, this work aims to extend Federated Learning (FL), a
decentralized learning framework that enables privacy-preserving training of
models, to work with heterogeneous clients in a practical cellular network. The
FL protocol iteratively asks random clients to download a trainable model from
a server, update it with own data, and upload the updated model to the server,
while asking the server to aggregate multiple client updates to further improve
the model. While clients in this protocol are free from disclosing own private
data, the overall training process can become inefficient when some clients are
with limited computational resources (i.e. requiring longer update time) or
under poor wireless channel conditions (longer upload time). Our new FL
protocol, which we refer to as FedCS, mitigates this problem and performs FL
efficiently while actively managing clients based on their resource conditions.
Specifically, FedCS solves a client selection problem with resource
constraints, which allows the server to aggregate as many client updates as
possible and to accelerate performance improvement in ML models. We conducted
an experimental evaluation using publicly-available large-scale image datasets
to train deep neural networks on MEC environment simulations. The experimental
results show that FedCS is able to complete its training process in a
significantly shorter time compared to the original FL protocol.

subspaces, which are consisted of positive and negative energy levels,

it exhibits perfect simple harmonic motion (SHM). In contrast to a canonical
coherent state, the shape of the wavepacket deforms periodically rather than
entirely translation. And the amplitude of the SHM is not determined by the

laboratory-controlled to challenging in-the-wild conditions and the recent
success of deep learning techniques in various fields, deep neural networks
have increasingly been leveraged to learn discriminative representations for
automatic FER. Recent deep FER systems generally focus on two important issues:
overfitting caused by a lack of sufficient training data and
expression-unrelated variations, such as illumination, head pose and identity
bias. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on deep FER, including
datasets and algorithms that provide insights into these intrinsic problems.
First, we describe the standard pipeline of a deep FER system with the related
background knowledge and suggestions of applicable implementations for each
stage. We then introduce the available datasets that are widely used in the
literature and provide accepted data selection and evaluation principles for
these datasets. For the state of the art in deep FER, we review existing novel
deep neural networks and related training strategies that are designed for FER
based on both static images and dynamic image sequences, and discuss their
advantages and limitations. Competitive performances on widely used benchmarks
are also summarized in this section. We then extend our survey to additional
related issues and application scenarios. Finally, we review the remaining
challenges and corresponding opportunities in this field as well as future
directions for the design of robust deep FER systems.

itself as an optically subluminous object with a spectrophotometric distance

criterion, the Gaia mission will in coming years allow for Dyson-sphere
searches that are complementary to searches based on waste-heat signatures at
infrared wavelengths. A limited search of this type is also possible at the
current time, by combining Gaia parallax distances with spectrophotometric
distances from ground-based surveys. Here, we discuss the merits and
shortcomings of this technique and carry out a limited search for Dyson-sphere
candidates in the sample of stars common to Gaia Data Release 1 and RAVE Data
Release 5. We find that a small fraction of stars indeed display distance
discrepancies of the type expected for nearly complete Dyson spheres. To shed
light on the properties of objects in this outlier population, we present
follow-up high-resolution spectroscopy for one of these stars, the late F-type
dwarf TYC 6111-1162-1. The spectrophotometric distance of this object is about
twice that derived from its Gaia parallax, and there is no detectable infrared
excess. While our analysis largely confirms the stellar parameters and the
spectrophotometric distance inferred by RAVE, a plausible explanation for the
discrepant distance estimates of this object is that the astrometric solution
has been compromised by an unseen binary companion, possibly a rather massive
white dwarf ($\approx 1\ M_\odot$). This scenario can be further tested through
upcoming Gaia data releases.

structure (GMFS) cycle evolution on the occurrence rate and parameters of
coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in cycles 23-24. It has been shown that over
solar cycles, CMEs are not distributed randomly, but they are regulated by
evolutionary changes in the GMFS. It is proposed, that the generation of
magnetic Rossby waves in the solar tachocline results in the GMFS cycle
changes. Each Rossby wave period favors a particular GMFS. It is proposed that
the changes in wave periods result in the GMFS reorganization and consequently
in CME location, occurrence rate, and parameter changes. The CME rate and
parameters depend on the sharpness of the GMFS changes, the strength of the
global magnetic field and the phase of a cycle.

of local structure preservation is limited because LRR lacks dictionary
learning. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-focus image fusion method
based on dictionary learning and LRR to get a better performance in both global
and local structure. Firstly, the source images are divided into several
patches by sliding window technique. Then, the patches are classified according
to the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features. And the sub-dictionaries
of each class are learned by K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD) algorithm.
Secondly, a global dictionary is constructed by combining these
sub-dictionaries. Then, we use the global dictionary in LRR to obtain the LRR
coefficients vector for each patch. Finally, the l_1-norm and choose-max fuse
strategy for each coefficients vector is adopted to reconstruct fused image
from the fused LRR coefficients and the global dictionary. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain state-of-the-art performance in
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations compared with serval classical

states which is called quantum information metric is presented. The holographic
principle (AdS/CFT) suggests that the quantum information metric
$G_{\lambda\lambda}$ between perturbed state and unperturbed state in field
theory has a dual description in the classical gravity. In this work we
calculate the quantum information metric of a theory which is dual to a conical
defect geometry and we show that it is $n$ times the one of its covering space.
We also give a holographic check for our result in the gravity side. Meanwhile,
it was argued that $G_{\lambda\lambda}$ is dual to a codimension-one surface in
spacetime and satisfies
$G_{\lambda\lambda}=n_{d}\cdot\mbox{Vol}(\Sigma_{max})/L^{d}$. We show that the
coefficient $n_d$ for conical defect should be rescaled by $n^2$ from the one
for AdS. A limit case of conical defect --- the massless BTZ black hole--- is
also considered. We show that the quantum information metric of the massless
BTZ black hole disagrees with the one obtained by taking the vanishing
temperature limit in BTZ black hole. This provides a new arena in differiating
the different phases between BTZ spacetime and its massless cousin.

informative priors, and incorporates the treatment of missing values and
non-homogeneous (heteroscedastic) observational uncertainties. Results. From
simulations, we estimate that this statistical tool renders kinematic (proper
motion) and photometric (luminosity) distributions of the cluster population

comprehensive modelling of the data properties allows it to get rid of the
biases present in previous works. In particular, those resulting from the use

semantic knowledge of the world into the pose regression network. We propose a
novel adaptive weighted fusion layer to aggregate motion-specific temporal
information and to fuse semantic features into the localization stream based on

that uses the relative motion to warp intermediate network representations in
the segmentation stream for learning consistent semantics. Finally, we
introduce a first-of-a-kind urban outdoor localization dataset with pixel-level
semantic labels and multiple loops for training deep networks. Extensive

outperforming local feature-based methods while simultaneously performing
multiple tasks and exhibiting substantial robustness in challenging scenarios.

in the high-soft state during our observations and traced out a {\it banana
track} in the Hardness Intensity Diagram (HID). We study {\bf the} evolution of
the Power Density Spectra (PDS) and the energy spectra along the HID. PDS show
presence of a broad Lorentzian feature (Peaked Noise or PN) centered at $1-13$
Hz and a very low frequency noise (VLFN). The energy spectra can be described
by sum of a thermal Comptonized component, a power-law and a broad iron line.
The hard tail seen in the energy spectra is variable and contribute $4-30$\% of
the total flux. The iron line seen in this source is broad (FWHM $\sim$ 2 keV)
and strong (EW $\sim$ $369-512$ eV). Only relativistic smearing in the
accretion disc can not explain the origin of this feature and requires other
mechanism such as broadening by Comptonization process in the external part of
the `Comptonized Corona'. A subtle and systematic evolution of the spectral
parameters (optical depth, electron temperature etc.) is seen as the source
moves along the HID. We study the correlation between frequency of the PN and
the spectral parameters. PN frequency seems to be correlated with the strength
of the corona. We discuss the implication of the results in the paper.

overcome in the phase-field approach for fracture by modeling the crack as a
diffusive object being described by a continuous field having high gradients.
The discrete crack limit case is approached for a small length-scale parameter
that controls the width of the transition region between the fully broken and
the undamaged phases. From a computational standpoint, this necessitates fine
meshes, at least locally, in order to accurately resolve the phase-field
profile. In the classical approach, phase-field models are computed on a fixed
mesh that is a priori refined in the areas where the crack is expected to
propagate. This on the other hand curbs the convenience of using phase-field
models for unknown crack paths and its ability to handle complex crack
propagation patterns. In this work, we overcome this issue by employing the
multi-level hp-refinement technique that enables a dynamically changing mesh
which in turn allows the refinement to remain local at singularities and high
gradients without problems of hanging nodes. Yet, in case of complex
geometries, mesh generation and in particular local refinement becomes
non-trivial. We address this issue by integrating a two-dimensional phase-field
framework for brittle fracture with the finite cell method (FCM). The FCM based
on high-order finite elements is a non-geometry-conforming discretization
technique wherein the physical domain is embedded into a larger fictitious
domain of simple geometry that can be easily discretized. This facilitates mesh
generation for complex geometries and supports local refinement. Numerical
examples including a comparison to a validation experiment illustrate the
applicability of the multi-level hp-refinement and the FCM in the context of
phase-field simulations.

mathematical models of the fluid forces, but these lack the accuracy (they
often assume the system to be linear) or flexibility to be useful over a wide
operating range.

low-computational-cost mathematical model using nonlinear system identification
techniques. This model is data driven: it is trained over a user-defined region
of interest using data obtained from experiments or simulations, or both. Here
we use a Van der Pol oscillator as well as CFD simulations of an oscillating
circular cylinder to generate the training data. Then a discrete-time
polynomial nonlinear state-space model is fit to the data. This model relates
the oscillation of the cylinder to the force that the fluid exerts on the
cylinder. The model is finally validated over a wide range of oscillation
frequencies and amplitudes, both inside and outside the so-called lock-in
region. We show that forces simulated by the model are in good agreement with

We examine this link theoretically using small-amplitude capillary waves in the
presence of a surfactant solution of dilute concentrations where the associated
Marangoni and surface viscosity effects are modelled via the Boussinesq-Scriven
formulation. The resulting integro-differential initial value problem is solved
analytically and surface viscosity is found to contribute an overall damping
effect on the amplitude of the capillary wave with varying degrees depending on
the lengthscale of the system. Numerically, we find the critical damping
wavelength to increase for increasing surface concentration but the rate of
increase remains different for both the surface viscosity and the Marangoni

the asymptotic tail distribution of the first time a stable (L\'evy) process in

of a stable process conditioned to remain in a cone as well as the the notion
of a stable process conditioned to absorb continuously at the apex of a cone

their fundamental properties through the lens of its Lamperti-Kiu

structure of the Markov additive process that drives such processes. As a
consequence of our interrogation of the underlying MAP, we are able to provide
an answer by example to the open question: If the modulator of a MAP has a
stationary distribution, under what conditions does its ascending ladder MAP
have a stationary distribution?
  We show how the two forms of conditioning are dual to one another. Moreover,
we construct the recurrent extension of the stable process killed on exiting a
cone, showing that it again remains in the class of self-similar Markov
processes.
  In the spirit of several very recent works, the results presented here show
that many previously unknown results of stable processes, which have long since
been understood for Brownian motion, or are easily proved for Brownian motion,
become accessible by appealing to the notion of the stable process as a

the domain of its generator for all time t > 0. This permits eigenfunction
approximation within the semigroup framework as a tool for the study of weak
solutions. The semigroup convolution formula, known to be rigorous on the
generator domain, is extended to the interpretation of weak solution on an
arbitrary time interval. A separate approximation theory can be developed by
using the invariance of the semigroup on eigenspaces of the Laplacian as the
system evolves. For (locally) bounded continuous L^2 forcing, this permits a
natural derivation of a maximal solution, which can logically include a
constraint on the solution as well. Operator forcing allows for the
incorporation of concurrent physical processes. A significant feature of the

leads the local dynamics in state transition varies considerably from path to
path and thus the distribution of the paths affects statistical characteristics
of the system. Such a characteristic can be referred to as path-dependence of a
system, and long-time correlation is an intrinsic feature of path-dependence
systems. We employed a local path density operator to describe the distribution
of state transition paths, and based on which we derived a new kinetic equation
for path-dependent systems. The kinetic equation is similar in form to the
Kramers-Moyal expansion, but with its expansion coefficients determined by the
cumulants with respect to state transition paths, instead of transition
moments. This characteristic makes it capable of accounting for the non-local
feature of systems, which is essential in studies of large scale systems where
the path-dependence is prominent. Short-time correlation approximation is also
discussed. It shows that the cumulants of state transition paths are equivalent
to jump moments when correlation time scales are infinitesimal, as makes the

complexity of the background, and the variable sizes of different organs. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework for multi-organ
segmentation by using organ-attention networks with reverse connections
(OAN-RCs) which are applied to 2D views, of the 3D CT volume, and output
estimates which are combined by statistical fusion exploiting structural
similarity. OAN is a two-stage deep convolutional network, where deep network
features from the first stage are combined with the original image, in a second
stage, to reduce the complex background and enhance the discriminative
information for the target organs. RCs are added to the first stage to give the
lower layers semantic information thereby enabling them to adapt to the sizes
of different organs. Our networks are trained on 2D views enabling us to use
holistic information and allowing efficient computation. To compensate for the
limited cross-sectional information of the original 3D volumetric CT,
multi-sectional images are reconstructed from the three different 2D view
directions. Then we combine the segmentation results from the different views
using statistical fusion, with a novel term relating the structural similarity
of the 2D views to the original 3D structure. To train the network and evaluate
results, 13 structures were manually annotated by four human raters and
confirmed by a senior expert on 236 normal cases. We tested our algorithm and
computed Dice-Sorensen similarity coefficients and surface distances for

epidemic thresholds of the modified SIS models can be either dramatically
altered or remain unchanged in comparison with the standard dynamics. For
uncorrelated synthetic networks having a power-law degree distribution with
exponent $\gamma<5/2$, the SIS dynamics are robust exhibiting essentially the
same outcomes for all investigated models. A threshold in better agreement with
the heterogeneous rather than quenched mean-field theory is observed in the
modified dynamics for exponent $\gamma>5/2$. Differences are more remarkable
for $\gamma>3$ where a finite threshold is found in the modified models in
contrast with the vanishing threshold of the original one. This duality is
elucidated in terms of epidemic lifespan on star graphs. We verify that the
activation of the modified SIS models is triggered in the innermost component

happens only for $\gamma<5/2$ in the standard model. For $\gamma>3$, the
activation in the modified dynamics is collective involving essentially the

exceptionally strong Coulomb interaction between charge carriers due to the

both the electronic properties and the optical response of the material. We
investigate electronic and optical properties of the typical monolayer TMDCs
MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ in the presence of excited carriers by
solving semiconductor Bloch equations on the full Brillouin zone. With
increasing carrier density, we systematically find a reduction of the exciton
binding energies due to Coulomb screening and Pauli blocking. Together with
excitation-induced band-gap shrinkage this leads to redshifts of excitonic
resonances up to the dissociation of excitons. As a central result, we predict
for all investigated monolayer TMDCs that the $\Sigma$-valley shifts stronger
than the K-valley. Two of the materials undergo a transition from direct to
indirect band gaps under carrier excitation similar to well-known
strain-induced effects. Our findings have strong implications for the filling
of conduction-band valleys with excited carriers and are relevant to transport

paper, we make the observation that dark matter comprising both a light and a
heavy component that modulate out of phase leads to interesting phenomenology
in annual modulation experiments. For an illustrative example, we use the
recently released DAMA/LIBRA phase-2 results with a lower energy threshold.
Immediately after, it was argued that a one-component spin-independent dark
matter explanation of the observed annual modulation is strongly disfavored or
excluded unless isospin-violating couplings are invoked. We show that a simple
two-component extension can reproduce the observed spectrum without the need to
invoke fine-tuned couplings. Using the publicly available DAMA/LIBRA data, we
perform a fit of the DAMA/LIBRA energy spectrum of the annual modulation
amplitude to a scenario with two dark matter components. We also take into
account how gravitational focusing affects the phases of the light and a heavy
components differently, which leads to nontrivial effects in the total
time-dependent rate. Our results show that there exists a unique solution in
agreement with the data in the simplest case of isospin-conserving couplings
with equal cross sections. The distinctive features found in this work are
crucial for a dark matter interpretation of any observed annual modulation.

both speaker similarity and quality evaluation by a human panel. As a
time-consuming, expensive, and non-reproducible process, it hinders rapid
prototyping of new VC technology. We address artifact assessment using an
alternative, objective approach leveraging from prior work on spoofing
countermeasures (CMs) for automatic speaker verification. Therein, CMs are used
for rejecting `fake' inputs such as replayed, synthetic or converted speech but
their potential for automatic speech artifact assessment remains unknown. This
study serves to fill that gap. As a supplement to subjective results for the
2018 Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC'18) data, we configure a standard
constant-Q cepstral coefficient CM to quantify the extent of processing
artifacts. Equal error rate (EER) of the CM, a confusability index of VC
samples with real human speech, serves as our artifact measure. Two clusters of
VCC'18 entries are identified: low-quality ones with detectable artifacts (low
EERs), and higher quality ones with less artifacts. None of the VCC'18 systems,
however, is perfect: all EERs are < 30 % (the `ideal' value would be 50 %). Our
preliminary findings suggest potential of CMs outside of their original
application, as a supplemental optimization and benchmarking tool to enhance VC

transverse focusing of charged particle beams in future laser plasma

Tabling adds the intuition of short-circuiting redundant computations (Warren

bottom-up component, whose procedural intuition is the initialization of a data
structure, in which a relation is initially computed and filled, on first
demand, and then used throughout the remainder of a larger computation for
efficient lookup. This allows many Prolog programs to be expressed fully

energy has a constant equation of state and the interaction model produces
stable perturbations. The resulting picture is constrained using different
astronomical data aiming to measure the impact of the anisotropic stress on the
cosmological parameters. Our analyses show that a non-zero interaction in the
dark sector is allowed while a non-interaction scenario is recovered within
68\% CL. The anisotropic stress is also constrained to be small, and its zero
value is permitted within 68\% CL. The dark energy equation of state, $w_x$, is
also found to be close to `$-1$' boundary. However, from the ratio of the CMB
TT spectra, we see that the model has a mild deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology while such deviation is almost forbidden from the CMB TT spectra
alone. Although the deviation is not much significant, but from the present
data, we cannot exclude such deviation. Overall, at the background level, the
model is close to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology while at the level of
perturbations, a non-zero but a very small interaction in the dark sector is
permitted. Perhaps, a more accurate conclusion can be made with the next
generation of surveys. We also found that the region $w_x < -1$, is found to be
effective to release the tension on $H_0$. Finally, from the Bayesian analysis,
we find that $\Lambda$CDM remains in still preferred over the interacting

including inspecting bridges, surveying farm land, and delivering cargo.
Automating these kinds of scenarios requires more than following a sequence of
GPS waypoints; they require integrating on-device hardware with real-time
analysis to provide feedback and control to the drone. Currently, implementing
these kinds of advanced scenarios is a complex task, requiring skilled software
engineers programming with drone APIs. We envision an alternate model to enable
drone operators to orchestrate advanced behaviors using a card-based approach.
We describe the design of our card-based programming model, position it
relative to other visual programming metaphors, share results from our paper

Results suggest that a wide range of scenarios can be implemented with moderate
mental effort and learning, balanced by intuitiveness and engagement.

simple arguments in possibly infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, and they do
not require strong assumptions on the array geometry or on the propagation

assumed to be linked through trade-offs. In well-mixed populations, these

with spatial self-structuring might evolve emergent trade-offs. Here, we
reexamine a model of the latter kind proposed by Ballegooijen and Boerlijst
with the aim of characterising the mechanisms causing the emergence of the
trade-off and its structural robustness. Using invadability criteria, we
establish the conditions under which an evolutionary feedback between
transmission and virulence mediated by pattern formation can poise the system
to a critical boundary separating a disordered state (without emergent
trade-off) from a self-structured phase (where the trade-off emerges), and
analytically calculate the functional shape of the boundary in a certain
approximation. Beyond evolutionary parameters, the success of an invasion
depends on the size and spatial structure of the invading and invaded
populations. Spatial self-structuring is often destroyed when hosts are mobile,
changing the evolutionary dynamics to those of a well-mixed population. In a
metapopulation scenario, the systematic extinction of the pathogen in the
disordered phase may counteract the disruptive effect of host mobility, favour
pattern formation and therefore recover the emergent trade-off.

  Radio Access Network","14 pages, 9 figures, to appear in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular
  Technology",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers a downlink ultra-dense heterogeneous cloud radio access
network (H-CRAN) which guarantees seamless coverage and can provide high date
rates. In order to reduce channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead,
incomplete inter-cluster CSI is considered, i.e., each remote radio head (RRH)
or macro base station (MBS) only measures the CSI from user equipments (UEs) in
its serving cluster. To reduce pilot consumption, pilot reuse among UEs is
assumed, resulting in imperfect intra-cluster CSI. A two-stage optimization
problem is then formulated. In the first stage, a pilot scheduling algorithm is
proposed to minimize the sum mean square error (MSE) of all channel estimates.
Specifically, the minimum number of required pilots along with a feasible pilot
allocation solution are first determined by applying the Dsatur algorithm, and
adjustments based on the defined level of pilot contamination are then carried
out for further improvement. Based on the pilot allocation result obtained in
the first stage, the second stage aims to maximize the sum spectral efficiency
(SE) of the network by optimizing the beam-vectors. Due to incomplete
inter-cluster CSI and imperfect intra-cluster CSI, an explicit expression of
each UE's achievable rate is unavailable. Hence, a lower bound on the
achievable rate is derived based on Jensen's inequality, and an alternative
robust transmission design (RTD) algorithm along with its distributed
realization are then proposed to maximize the derived tight lower bound.
Simulation results show that compared with existing algorithms, the system
performance can be greatly improved by the proposed algorithms in terms of both
sum MSE and sum SE.

PHP code that interact with the interpreter's heap in useful ways, such as
making allocations and deallocations of particular sizes, or allocating objects
containing sensitive data, such as pointers. SHRIKE then uses our search
algorithm to piece together these fragments into programs, searching for one
that achieves a desired heap layout. SHRIKE allows an exploit developer to
focus on the higher level concepts in an exploit, and to defer the resolution
of heap layout constraints to SHRIKE. We demonstrate this by using SHRIKE in
the construction of a control-flow hijacking exploit for the PHP interpreter.

clues from the image (e.g., hope from green), and generating poems to satisfy
both relevance to the image and poeticness in language level. To solve the
above challenges, we formulate the task of poem generation into two correlated
sub-tasks by multi-adversarial training via policy gradient, through which the
cross-modal relevance and poetic language style can be ensured. To extract
poetic clues from images, we propose to learn a deep coupled visual-poetic
embedding, in which the poetic representation from objects, sentiments and
scenes in an image can be jointly learned. Two discriminative networks are
further introduced to guide the poem generation, including a multi-modal

overestimated. We also present the first non-parametric reconstruction applied

framework, supporting---among other reasoning modes---the central task of query
answering. In the propositional case, query answering amounts to computing
cautious consequences of the input program among the atoms in a given set of
candidates, where a cautious consequence is an atom belonging to all stable
models. Currently, the most efficient algorithms either iteratively verify the
existence of a stable model of the input program extended with the complement
of one candidate, where the candidate is heuristically selected, or introduce a
clause enforcing the falsity of at least one candidate, so that the solver is
free to choose which candidate to falsify at any time during the computation of
a stable model. This paper introduces new algorithms for the computation of
cautious consequences, with the aim of driving the solver to search for stable
models discarding more candidates. Specifically, one of such algorithms
enforces minimality on the set of true candidates, where different notions of
minimality can be used, and another takes advantage of unsatisfiable cores
computation. The algorithms are implemented in WASP, and experiments on
benchmarks from the latest ASP competitions show that the new algorithms
perform better than the state of the art. (Under consideration for acceptance

computer graphics. Traditional approaches rely heavily on matching
corresponding points or features to guide the alignment, a paradigm that
falters when significant shape portions are missing. These techniques generally
do not incorporate prior knowledge about expected shape characteristics, which
can help compensate for any misleading cues left by inaccuracies exhibited in
the input shapes. We present an approach based on a deep neural network,
leveraging shape datasets to learn a shape-aware prior for source-to-target
alignment that is robust to shape incompleteness. In the absence of ground
truth alignments for supervision, we train a network on the task of shape
alignment using incomplete shapes generated from full shapes for
self-supervision. Our network, called ALIGNet, is trained to warp complete
source shapes to incomplete targets, as if the target shapes were complete,
thus essentially rendering the alignment partial-shape agnostic. We aim for the
network to develop specialized expertise over the common characteristics of the
shapes in each dataset, thereby achieving a higher-level understanding of the
expected shape space to which a local approach would be oblivious. We constrain
ALIGNet through an anisotropic total variation identity regularization to
promote piecewise smooth deformation fields, facilitating both partial-shape
agnosticism and post-deformation applications. We demonstrate that ALIGNet
learns to align geometrically distinct shapes, and is able to infer plausible
mappings even when the target shape is significantly incomplete. We show that
our network learns the common expected characteristics of shape collections,
without over-fitting or memorization, enabling it to produce plausible
deformations on unseen data during test time.

are still poorly understood. Angular momentum conservation prevents gas within
$\sim10\,$pc of the black hole from reaching radii $\sim10^{-3}\,$pc where
viscous accretion becomes efficient. Here we present simulations of the
collapse of a clumpy shell of swept-up isothermal gas, which is assumed to have
formed as a result of feedback from a previous episode of AGN activity. The gas
falls towards the SMBH forming clumps and streams, which intersect, collide,
and often form a disc. These collisions promote partial cancellations of
angular momenta, resulting in further infall and more collisions. This
continued collisional cascade generates a tail of gas with sufficiently small
angular momenta and provides a viable route for gas inflow to sub-parsec
scales. The efficiency of this process hardly depends on details, such as gas
temperature, initial virial ratio and power spectrum of the gas distribution,
as long as it is not strongly rotating.
  Adding star formation to this picture might explain the near-simultaneous
formation of the S-stars (from tidally disrupted binaries formed in plunging
gas streams) and the sub-parsec young stellar disc around Sgr A$^{\!\star}$.

on the biological effectiveness, i.e. the amount of damage per energy unit
deposited (measured in gray or Gy, equivalent to 1 joule/kg). The ionization
density is usually represented by the Linear Energy Transfer or LET, also
expressed in keV/{\mu}m. Photon beams (X-rays, g-rays) are low-LET radiation,
with a sparsely ionising characteristic. Particle beams have a higher LET, with
a more dense distribution of energy deposits along the particle tracks. Protons
are intermediary, with a LET larger than the photon one, but still belong to
the 'radiobiological' group of low LET. The higher the ionization density, the
higher the biological effectiveness per unit of dose.

between two sequences for various tasks such as natural language inference,
paraphrasing and entailment. These aforementioned tasks are similar in nature,
yet they are often modeled individually. Knowledge transfer can be effective
for closely related tasks. However, transferring all knowledge, some of which
irrelevant for a target task, can lead to sub-optimal results due to
\textit{negative} transfer. Hence, this paper focuses on the transferability of
both instances and parameters across natural language understanding tasks by
proposing an ensemble-based transfer learning method. \newline The primary
contribution of this paper is the combination of both \textit{Dropout} and
\textit{Bagging} for improved transferability in neural networks, referred to
as \textit{Dropping} herein. We present a straightforward yet novel approach
for incorporating source \textit{Dropping} Networks to a target task for
few-shot learning that mitigates \textit{negative} transfer. This is achieved
by using a decaying parameter chosen according to the slope changes of a
smoothed spline error curve at sub-intervals during training. We compare the
proposed approach against hard parameter sharing and soft parameter sharing
transfer methods in the few-shot learning case. We also compare against models
that are fully trained on the target task in the standard supervised learning
setup. The aforementioned adjustment leads to improved transfer learning
performance and comparable results to the current state of the art only using a
fraction of the data from the target task.

fundamental nature of $p^{\star}$ remains unclear, in particular whether it
marks a true quantum phase transition. We have measured the specific heat $C$

point, as observed in heavy-fermion and iron-based superconductors where their
antiferromagnetic phase ends. We conclude that the pseudogap phase of cuprates
ends at a quantum critical point, whose associated fluctuations are most likely
involved in the $d$-wave pairing and the anomalous scattering.

solutions with nontrivial momentum transfer, jumping between different regions

that there exist bound states for every value of the total momentum, and even

(the unit circle is not contained in its spectrum), implying that the transfer
function is analytic in a neighborhood of zero and on a neighborhood of the
unit circle rather than on the unit disk. More generally, we consider bicausal
systems, for which the transfer function need not be analytic in a neighborhood

of response priming, where response activation is first controlled exclusively
by the prime and then taken over by the actual target. Priming thus occurs by
motor conflict because a response-inconsistent prime can temporarily drive the
process towards the incorrect response. While the original model assumed prime
and target signals to be identical in strength, we allow different rates of
response activation (cf. Mattler & Palmer, 2012; Schubert et al., 2012). Our

classified as first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) and continuous ones. While
the latter has a well-established theory of the renormalization group, the
former is only qualitatively accounted for by classical theories of nucleation,

A theory to integrate FOPTs into the framework of the renormalization-group
theory has been proposed but seems to contradict with extant wisdom and lacks
numerical evidence. Here we show that universal hysteresis scaling as predicted
by the renormalization-group theory emerges unambiguously when the theory is
combined intimately with the theory of nucleation and growth in the FOPTs of
the paradigmatic two-dimensional Ising model driven by a linearly varying
externally applied field below its critical point. This not only provides a new
method to rectify the nucleation theories, but also unifies the theories for

Unfortunately, the transferability is usually defined as discrete states and it
differs with domains and network architectures. Existing works usually
heuristically apply parameter-sharing or fine-tuning, and there is no
principled approach to learn a parameter transfer strategy. To address the gap,
a parameter transfer unit (PTU) is proposed in this paper. The PTU learns a
fine-grained nonlinear combination of activations from both the source and the
target domain networks, and subsumes hand-crafted discrete transfer states. In
the PTU, the transferability is controlled by two gates which are artificial
neurons and can be learned from data. The PTU is a general and flexible module
which can be used in both CNNs and RNNs. Experiments are conducted with various
network architectures and multiple transfer domain pairs. Results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the PTU as it outperforms heuristic parameter-sharing and

neutrons (UCN). It is known that the sD_2 must be sufficiently cold, of high
purity and mostly in its ortho-state in order to guarantee long lifetimes of
UCN in the solid from which they are extracted into vacuum. Also the UCN
transparency of the bulk sD_2 material must be high because crystal
inhomogeneities limit the mean free path for elastic scattering and reduce the
extraction efficiency. Observations at the UCN sources at Paul Scherrer
Institute and at Los Alamos National Laboratory consistently show a decrease of
the UCN yield with time of operation after initial preparation or later
treatment (`conditioning') of the sD_2. We show that, in addition to the
quality of the bulk sD_2, the quality of its surface is essential. Our
observations and simulations support the view that the surface is deteriorating
due to a build-up of D_2 frost-layers under pulsed operation which leads to
strong albedo reflections of UCN and subsequent loss. We report results of UCN
yield measurements, temperature and pressure behavior of deuterium during
source operation and conditioning, and UCN transport simulations. This,
together with optical observations of sD_2 frost formation on initially
transparent sD_2 in offline studies with pulsed heat input at the North

separate the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction field

consistent algorithm, their average behavior converges to a~Nash equilibrium
(NE) of the~game. A similar result is known about extensive form games, but
the~played strategies need to be Hannan consistent with respect to
the~counterfactual values, which are often difficult to obtain. We study
zero-sum extensive form games with simultaneous moves, but otherwise perfect
information. These games generalize normal form games and they are a special
case of extensive form games. We study whether applying HC algorithms in each
decision point of these games directly to the~observed payoffs leads to
convergence to a~Nash equilibrium. This learning process corresponds to a~class
of Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms, which are popular for playing
simultaneous-move games but do not have any known performance guarantees. We
show that using HC algorithms directly on the~observed payoffs is not

further define an~additional property of HC algorithms, which is sufficient to

computing devices. In such computing systems, training is performed only at the
output level, by adjusting the output from the reservoir with respect to a
target signal. In our formulation, the reservoir can be an arbitrary physical
system, driven out of thermal equilibrium by an external driving. The DNLS is a
general oscillator model with broad application in physics and we argue that
our approach is completely general and does not depend on the physical
realisation of the reservoir. The driving, which encodes the object to be
recognised, acts as a thermodynamical force, one for each node in the
reservoir. Currents associated to these thermodynamical forces in turn encode
the output signal from the reservoir. As an example, we consider numerically
the problem of supervised learning for pattern recognition, using as reservoir
a network of nonlinear oscillators.

plasmas are analyzed in order to rigorously test a recently developed
scale-free phase transition theory. The ""Fractal-Domain-Structure"" (FDS) theory
is based on the kinetic theory of Frenkel. It assumes the formation of
homogeneous domains, separated by defect lines, during crystallization and a
fractal relationship between domain area and boundary length. For the defect
number fraction and system energy a scale free power-law relation is predicted.
The long range scaling behavior of the bond order correlation function shows
clearly that the complex plasma phase transitions are not of KTHNY type.
Previous preliminary results obtained by counting the number of dislocations
and applying a bond order metric for structural analysis are reproduced. These
findings are supplemented by extending the use of the bond order metric to
measure the defect number fraction and furthermore applying state-of-the-art
analysis methods, allowing a systematic testing of the FDS theory with
unprecedented scrutiny: A morphological analysis of lattice structure is
performed via Minkowski tensor methods. Minkowski tensors form a complete
family of additive, motion covariant and continuous morphological measures that
are sensitive to non-linear properties. The FDS theory is rigorously confirmed
and predictions of the theory are reproduced extremely well. The predicted
scale-free power law relation between defect fraction number and system energy
is verified for one more order of magnitude at high energies compared to the
inherently discontinuous bond order metric. Minkowski Tensor analysis turns out
to be a powerful tool for investigations of crystallization processes. It is
capable to reveal non-linear local topological properties, however, still
provides easily interpretable results founded on a solid mathematical
framework.
