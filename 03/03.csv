of study resulted in multiple algorithmic approaches and deep understanding of
the combinatorics of the problem. Because of its central role in parameterized
complexity, the first edition of the Parameterized Algorithms and Computational

showed large discrepancy between performance of different classic approaches to

that returns whether two given points belong to the same cluster in a fixed

queries are sufficient to efficiently recover a clustering that, with
probability at least $(1 - \delta)$, simultaneously has a cost of at most $(1 +
\epsilon)$ times the optimal cost and an accuracy of at least $(1 - \epsilon)$?
  We show how to achieve such a clustering on $n$ points with $O{((k^2 \log n)
\cdot m{(Q, \epsilon^4, \delta / (k\log n))})}$ oracle queries, when the $k$
clusters can be learned with an $\epsilon'$ error and a failure probability
$\delta'$ using $m(Q, \epsilon',\delta')$ labeled samples in the supervised
setting, where $Q$ is the set of candidate cluster centers. We show that $m(Q,
\epsilon', \delta')$ is small both for $k$-means instances in Euclidean space
and for those in finite metric spaces. We further show that, for the Euclidean
$k$-means instances, we can avoid the dependency on $n$ in the query complexity
at the expense of an increased dependency on $k$: specifically, we give a
slightly more involved algorithm that uses $O(k^4/(\epsilon^2 \delta) +
(k^{9}/\epsilon^4) \log(1/\delta) + k \cdot m(\mathbb{R}^r, \epsilon^4/k,
\delta))$ oracle queries.
  We also show that the number of queries needed for $(1 - \epsilon)$-accuracy
in Euclidean $k$-means must linearly depend on the dimension of the underlying
Euclidean space, and for finite metric space $k$-means, we show that it must at
least be logarithmic in the number of candidate centers. This shows that our
query complexities capture the right dependencies on the respective parameters.

models and experimental data helps to alleviate this problem. This paper shows
how a sparse approximation to Gaussian processes can be used to estimate the
model bias over the complete nuclide chart at the example of inclusive
double-differential neutron spectra for incident protons above 100\,MeV. A
powerful feature of the presented approach is the ability to predict the model
bias for energies, angles, and isotopes where data are missing. The number of
experimental data points that can be taken into account is at least in the
order of magnitude of~$10^4$ thanks to the sparse approximation. The approach
is applied to the Li\`ege Intranuclear Cascade Model (INCL) coupled to the

inverse problems, that of quantifying model discrepancies and errors. While
significant strides have been made in calibrating model parameters, the
overwhelming majority of pertinent methods is based on the assumption of a
perfect model. Motivated by problems in solid mechanics which, as all problems
in continuum thermodynamics, are described by conservation laws and
phenomenological constitutive closures, we argue that in order to quantify
model uncertainty in a physically meaningful manner, one should break open the
black-box forward model. In particular we propose formulating an undirected
probabilistic model that explicitly accounts for the governing equations and
their validity. This recasts the solution of both forward and inverse problems
as probabilistic inference tasks where the problem's state variables should not
only be compatible with the data but also with the governing equations as well.
Even though the probability densities involved do not contain any black-box
terms, they live in much higher-dimensional spaces. In combination with the
intractability of the normalization constant of the undirected model employed,
this poses significant challenges which we propose to address with a
linearly-scaling, double-layer of Stochastic Variational Inference. We
demonstrate the capabilities and efficacy of the proposed model in synthetic
forward and inverse problems (with and without model error) in elastography.

indeed shows that such an algorithm would refute the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis (SETH) [Abboud, Backurs, Vassilevska Williams + Bringmann,

  Despite the quadratic-time barrier, for over 40 years an enduring scientific
interest continued to produce fast algorithms for LCS and its variations.
Particular attention was put into identifying and exploiting input parameters
that yield strongly subquadratic time algorithms for special cases of interest,
e.g., differential file comparison. This line of research was successfully
pursued until 1990, at which time significant improvements came to a halt. In
this paper, using the lens of fine-grained complexity, our goal is to (1)
justify the lack of further improvements and (2) determine whether some special
cases of LCS admit faster algorithms than currently known.
  To this end, we provide a systematic study of the multivariate complexity of
LCS, taking into account all parameters previously discussed in the literature:
the input size $n:=\max\{|x|,|y|\}$, the length of the shorter string
$m:=\min\{|x|,|y|\}$, the length $L$ of an LCS of $x$ and $y$, the numbers of
deletions $\delta := m-L$ and $\Delta := n-L$, the alphabet size, as well as
the numbers of matching pairs $M$ and dominant pairs $d$. For any class of
instances defined by fixing each parameter individually to a polynomial in
terms of the input size, we prove a SETH-based lower bound matching one of
three known algorithms. Specifically, we determine the optimal running time for
LCS under SETH as $(n+\min\{d, \delta \Delta, \delta m\})^{1\pm o(1)}$.

observe three $J=2\rightarrow1$ HCN rotational transitions, the $(0,1^{{1}_{\rm
c}},0)$ and $(0,1^{{1}_{\rm d}},0)$ $l$-doublet components, and the line from
the (0,0,0) ground state. Results. The $(0,1^{{1}_{\rm c}},0)$ maser line is
detected toward 11 of 13 observed sources, which all show emission in the
(0,0,0) transition. In most of the sources, the peak intensity of the
$(0,1^{{1}_{\rm c}},0)$ line rivals that of the (0,0,0) line; in two sources,
it is even stronger. Except for the object with the highest mass-loss rate,
IRC+10216, the $(0,1^{{1}_{\rm c}},0)$ line covers a smaller velocity range
than the (0,0,0) line. Conclusions. Maser emission in the 177 GHz
$J=2\rightarrow1$ $(0,1^{{1}_{\rm c}},0)$ line of HCN appears to be common in
carbon-rich AGB stars. (Abbreviated)

The host LINER galaxies were studied and compared with a well-defined control

stellar age population, we find that LINERs are redder and older than the

than the control sample, at a given galaxy colour, indicating that some
external process could have accelerated the evolution of the stellar
population. The analysis of the host properties shows that the control sample
exhibits a strong relation between colours, ages and the local density, while
more than 90 per cent of the LINERs are redder and older than the mean values,
independently of the neighbourhood density. Furthermore, a detailed study in
three local density ranges shows that, while control sample galaxies are redder
and older as a function of stellar mass and density, LINER galaxies mismatch
the known morphology-density relation of galaxies without low-ionization

low-ionization emission although the contribution of nuclear activity is not

exhibiting perpendicular anisotropy, the power spectrum of the magnetization
noise, $S(\nu)$, exhibits a remarkably robust $\nu^{-3/2}$ power law over

depends strongly on applied in- and out-of-plane magnetic fields, revealing

viable network technology that can potentially increase spectral utilization
and improve power efficiency for proximitybased wireless applications and
services. However, a major challenge in such deployment scenarios is the
interference caused by D2D links when sharing the same resources with cellular
users. In this work, we propose a channel allocation (CA) scheme together with
a set of three power control (PC) schemes to mitigate interference in a D2D
underlaid cellular system modeled as a random network using the mathematical
tool of stochastic geometry. The novel aspect of the proposed CA scheme is that
it enables D2D links to share resources with multiple cellular users as opposed
to one as previously considered in the literature. Moreover, the accompanying
distributed PC schemes further manage interference during link establishment
and maintenance. The first two PC schemes compensate for large-scale path-loss
effects and maximize the D2D sum rate by employing distance-dependent pathloss
parameters of the D2D link and the base station, including an error estimation
margin. The third scheme is an adaptive PC scheme based on a variable target
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, which limits the interference caused
by D2D users and provides sufficient coverage probability for cellular users.
Closed-form expressions for the coverage probability of cellular links, D2D
links, and sum rate of D2D links are derived in terms of the allocated power,
density of D2D links, and path-loss exponent. The impact of these key system
parameters on network performance is analyzed and compared with previous work.
Simulation results demonstrate an enhancement in cellular and D2D coverage
probabilities, and an increase in spectral and power efficiency.

attention by many researchers. One of the main motivation beyond this interest
is related to the word prediction problem, which states that given a set words
in a sentence, one can recommend the next word. In literature, this problem is
solved by methods based on syntactic or semantic analysis. Solely, each of
these analysis cannot achieve practical results for end-user applications. For
instance, the Latent Semantic Analysis can handle semantic features of text,
but cannot suggest words considering syntactical rules. On the other hand,
there are models that treat both methods together and achieve state-of-the-art
results, e.g. Deep Learning. These models can demand high computational effort,
which can make the model infeasible for certain types of applications. With the
advance of the technology and mathematical models, it is possible to develop
faster systems with more accuracy. This work proposes a hybrid word suggestion

principles simulations. By varying the strength of the electron-phonon coupling

different complex electronic structures are examined. Surprisingly, we find
that at a given quality factor, none provides a better figure of merit than
that of a material with a simple, parabolic band and acoustic deformation
potential scattering. A qualitative argument for this unexpected finding is
presented. This apparent universal behavior suggests that even for complex
electronic band structures, the thermoelectric figure of merit depends solely
on the ratio of electrical to thermal conductivity; the Seebeck coefficient and
Lorenz number need not be considered. This observation should simplify the
search for promising new materials, but if exceptions to this behavior can be

tomography. Firstly, a research is conducted for several radioisotopes that
decay via \b{eta}+ decay followed by de-excitation of an excited nucleus.
Efficiency, purity and false positive rate are calculated for each isotope as a
function of energy deposited threshold, with a hypothesis that signals caused
by 511 keV photons deposit smaller values of energy than 1 z 13the selected

suggests using 44 Sc, which is the most promising candidate for medical
applications. With the use of GATE and J-POS simulation software, in-phantom
scattering was introduced and the best energy deposited threshold value was
estimated to be approximately 375 keV. It corresponds to almost 100% efficiency
for 511 keV signals, 75% purity for 511 keV photons, and approximately 70%
efficiency and purity for prompt photons.

inputs, with hierarchically organized cortical circuits serially transforming
thalamic signals to cognitively-relevant representations. Given the absence of
local excitatory connections within the thalamus, the notion of thalamic
`relay' seemed like a reasonable description over the last several decades.
Recent advances in experimental approaches and theory provide a broader
perspective on the role of the thalamus in cognitively-relevant cortical
computations, and suggest that only a subset of thalamic circuit motifs fit the
relay description. Here, we discuss this perspective and highlight the
potential role for the thalamus -- and specifically mediodorsal (MD) nucleus --
in dynamic selection of cortical representations through a combination of
intrinsic thalamic computations and output signals that change cortical network
functional parameters. We suggest that through the contextual modulation of
cortical computation, thalamus and cortex jointly optimize the information/cost
tradeoff in an emergent fashion. We emphasize that coordinated experimental and
theoretical efforts will provide a path to understanding the role of the
thalamus in cognition, along with an understanding to augment cognitive
capacity in health and disease.

~25 {\mu}m for the Orion A star-forming complex. The basis of this work is
near-infrared data acquired with VISTA, in combination with Pan-STARRS and
mid-infrared Spitzer photometry. We obtain colour excess ratios for eight
passbands by fitting a series of colour-colour diagrams. The fits are performed
using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, together with a linear model under a
Bayesian formalism. The resulting colour excess ratios are directly interpreted
as a measure of the extinction law. We show that the Orion A molecular cloud is
characterized by flat mid-infrared extinction, similar to many other recently
studied sightlines. Moreover, we find statistically significant evidence that
the extinction law from ~1 {\mu}m to at least ~6 {\mu}m varies across the
cloud. In particular, we find a gradient along galactic longitude, where
regions near the ONC show a different extinction law compared to L1641 and
L1647, the low-mass star-forming sites in the cloud complex. These variations
are of the order of only 3% and are most likely caused by the influence of the
massive stars on their surrounding medium. While the observed general trends in
our measurements are in agreement with model predictions, both well-established
and new dust grain models are not able to fully reproduce our infrared
extinction curve. We also present a new extinction map featuring a resolution
of 1 arcmin and revisit the correlation between extinction and dust optical
depth. This analysis shows that cloud substructure, which is not sampled by
background sources, affects the conversion factor between these two measures.
In conclusion, we argue that specific characteristics of the infrared
extinction law are still not well understood, but Orion A can serve as an
unbiased template for future studies.

of rapid radiative cooling as a source of fast-moving ($v \sim 1000$ km/s),
cool ($10^4$ K) gas observed in absorption line studies of outflows around some
star-forming galaxies. By varying the mass-loading and geometry of the
simulated winds, we identify a region of parameter space that leads to cool gas
in outflows. In particular, when using an analytically-motivated central
feedback model, we find that cooling flows can be produced with reasonable
mass-loading rates ($\dot{M}_{wind} / \dot{M}_{SFR} \sim 0.5$), provided the
star formation rate surface density is high. When a more realistic clustered
feedback model is applied, destruction of high density clouds near the disk and
interactions between different outflow regions indicate that lower mass-loading
rates of the hot gas within the feedback region may still produce multiphase
outflows. These results suggest an origin for fast-moving cool gas in outflows
that does not rely on directly accelerating cool gas from the interstellar
medium. These cooling flows may additionally provide an explanation for the
multiphase gas ubiquitously observed in the halos of star-forming galaxies at
low redshift.

It surrounds an X-ray point source with an intrinsic X-ray luminosity $L_{i}$

causing gas to fragment and form Population III stars, but Lyman-Werner
radiation can suppress H$_2$ formation and allow gas to collapse directly into
a massive black hole. The critical flux required to inhibit H$_2$ formation,
$J_{\rm crit}$, is hotly debated, largely due to the uncertainties in the
source radiation spectrum, H$_2$ self-shielding, and collisional dissociation
rates. Here, we test the power of the direct collapse model in a
self-consistent, time-dependant, non-uniform Lyman-Werner radiation field --
the first time such has been done in a cosmological volume -- using an updated
version of the SPH+N-body tree code Gasoline with H$_2$ non-equilibrium
abundance tracking, H$_2$ cooling, and a modern SPH implementation. We vary
$J_{\rm crit} $ from $30$ to $10^3$ in units of $J_{21}$ to study how this
parameter impacts the number of seed black holes and the type of galaxies which
host them. We focus on black hole formation as a function of environment, halo
mass, metallicity, and proximity of the Lyman-Werner source. Massive black hole
seeds form more abundantly with lower $J_{\rm crit}$ thresholds, but regardless
of $J_{\rm crit}$, these seeds typically form in halos that have recently begun
star formation. Our results do not confirm the proposed atomic cooling halo
pair scenario; rather black hole seeds predominantly form in low-metallicity
pockets of halos which already host star formation.

investigate the consistency of these models using the three physical

looser constraints derived from the $e^+ + e^-$ flux data. We also perform a
multi-wavelength multi-messenger analysis by fitting simultaneously the radio
flux on Vela YZ and Cygnus Loop and the $e^+ + e^-$ flux, and checking the
outputs against the $e^+ + e^-$ dipole anisotropy data. Remarkably, we find a
model which is compatible with all the $e^++e^-$ flux data, the radio data for

level model. The dynamical excitation of the flux pair closes the flux gap in
the spectrum of the spin correlation function locally for the gapless KSL even
from the perturbative response to a weak magnetic field. Beyond the
perturbative regime, the p-h asymmetry competes with the magnetic field and
results in a rich phase diagram. Moreover, the magnetic field breaks the gauge
equivalence of the ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic Kitaev couplings of the
ground state and leads to very different behaviors for the two cases. The

Systems (DSDPSs), which deal with processing of unbounded streams of continuous

a DSDPS is the scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing average
end-to-end tuple processing time. A widely-used solution is to distribute
workload evenly over machines in the cluster in a round-robin manner, which is
obviously not efficient due to lack of consideration for communication delay.
Model-based approaches do not work well either due to the high complexity of
the system environment. We aim to develop a novel model-free approach that can
learn to well control a DSDPS from its experience rather than accurate and
mathematically solvable system models, just as a human learns a skill (such as
cooking, driving, swimming, etc). Specifically, we, for the first time, propose
to leverage emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for enabling model-free
control in DSDPSs; and present design, implementation and evaluation of a novel
and highly effective DRL-based control framework, which minimizes average
end-to-end tuple processing time by jointly learning the system environment via
collecting very limited runtime statistics data and making decisions under the
guidance of powerful Deep Neural Networks. To validate and evaluate the
proposed framework, we implemented it based on a widely-used DSDPS, Apache
Storm, and tested it with three representative applications. Extensive
experimental results show 1) Compared to Storm's default scheduler and the
state-of-the-art model-based method, the proposed framework reduces average
tuple processing by 33.5% and 14.0% respectively on average. 2) The proposed
framework can quickly reach a good scheduling solution during online learning,
which justifies its practicability for online control in DSDPSs.

growth of qubit numbers and coherence times comes the increasingly difficult
challenge of quantum program compilation. This entails the translation of a
high-level description of a quantum algorithm to hardware-specific low-level
operations which can be carried out by the quantum device. Some parts of the
calculation may still be performed manually due to the lack of efficient
methods. This, in turn, may lead to a design gap, which will prevent the
programming of a quantum computer. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in
fully-automatic quantum compilation. We motivate directions for future research
to tackle these challenges. Yet, with the algorithms and approaches that exist
today, we demonstrate how to automatically perform the quantum programming flow
from algorithm to a physical quantum computer for a simple algorithmic
benchmark, namely the hidden shift problem. We present and use two tool flows
which invoke RevKit. One which is based on ProjectQ and which targets the IBM
Quantum Experience or a local simulator, and one which is based on Microsoft's
quantum programming language Q$\#$.

transmission spectra, thermal resistances due to individual molecules remain
almost the same for all species. On the other hand, thermal resistance due to
combinations of different species are not additive and show large differences
depending on the species. Using a toy model, the physics underlying the

equivalent resistance of two scatterers having the same resistances can be
close to the sum of the constituents or $\sim$70\% of it depending on the
relative positions of the antiresonances. The relative positions of the
antiresonances determine the net change in transmission, therefore the
equivalent resistance. Since the entire spectrum is involved in phonon spectrum
changes in different parts of the spectrum become important. Performing

of particles in the Standard Model for a wide temperature interval. The impact
of such corrections on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves as well
as the damping effect due to free-streaming particles is investigated by
numerically solving the evolution equation of tensor perturbations in the

free-streaming photons and neutrinos gives rise to some additional damping

nature of the QCD crossover results in a smooth spectrum for modes that reenter
the horizon at around the epoch of the QCD phase transition. Furthermore, we
explicitly show that the values of the effective degrees of freedom remain
smaller than the commonly used value 106.75 even at temperature much higher

were learned through training in single-agent environments, but they have
difficulty in generalizing to multi-agent driving scenarios. We argue these
difficulties arise because observations at training and test time are sampled
from different distributions. This difference makes such models unsuitable for
the simulation of driving scenes, where multiple agents must interact
realistically over long time horizons. We extend GAIL to address these

~47--48 M_sun if a single star, or ~60--80 M_sun if in a binary system.
However, we also find that the progenitor candidate could be a very blue and
young compact cluster, further implying a very massive (>65 M_sun) progenitor.
Furthermore, the actual progenitor might not be associated with the candidate
at all and could be far less massive. From the immediate stellar environment,
we find possible evidence for three different populations; if the SN progenitor
was a member of the youngest population, this would be consistent with an

$\Delta$ has chromatic number at most $\Delta + 1$, and this is tight for
cliques. Much attention has been devoted to improving this ""greedy bound"" for
graphs without large cliques. Brooks famously proved that this bound can be
improved by one if $\Delta \geq 3$ and the graph contains no clique of size
$\Delta + 1$. Reed's Conjecture states that the ""greedy bound"" can be improved
by $k$ if the graph contains no clique of size $\Delta + 1 - 2k$. Johansson
proved that the ""greedy bound"" can be improved by a factor of
$\Omega(\ln(\Delta)^{-1})$ or
$\Omega\left(\frac{\ln(\ln(\Delta))}{\ln(\Delta)}\right)$ for graphs with no
triangles or no cliques of any fixed size, respectively.
  Notably missing is a $\textit{linear}$ improvement on the ""greedy bound"" for
graphs without large cliques. In this paper, we prove that for sufficiently
large $\Delta$, if $G$ is a graph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ and no
clique of size $\omega$, then $$\chi(G) \leq
72\Delta\sqrt{\frac{\ln(\omega)}{\ln(\Delta)}}.$$ This implies that for
sufficiently large $\Delta$, if $\omega^{(72c)^2} \leq \Delta$ then $\chi(G)
\leq \Delta/c$.
  This bound actually holds for the list-chromatic and even the
correspondence-chromatic number (also known as the DP-chromatic number). In
fact, we prove what we call a ""local version"" of it, a result implying the
existence of a coloring when the number of available colors for each vertex
depends on local parameters, like the degree and the clique number of its
neighborhood. Our result simultaneously implies the linear improvement over the
""greedy bound"" and the two aforementioned results of Johansson.

consists of a diffusing thermal magnon cloud, parametrized by the magnon
chemical potential ($\mu_{m}$), with a diffusion length of several microns in
yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Transient opto-thermal measurements of the
spin-Seebeck effect (SSE) as a function of temperature reveal the time
evolution of $\mu_{m}$ due to intrinsic SSE in YIG. The interface SSE develops
at times < 2 ns while the intrinsic SSE signal continues to evolve at times >
500 $\mu$s, dominating the temperature dependence of SSE in bulk YIG.
Time-dependent SSE data are fit to a multi-temperature model of coupled
spin/heat transport using finite element method (FEM), where the magnon spin
lifetime ($\tau$) and magnon-phonon thermalization time ($\tau_{mp}$) are used

exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V$ such that letters $x$ and $y$ alternate
in $w$ if and only if $xy$ is an edge in $E$. Thus, edges of $G$ are defined by
avoiding the consecutive pattern 11 in a word representing $G$, that is, by
avoiding $xx$ and $yy$.
  In 2017, Jeff Remmel has introduced the notion of a $k$-$11$-representable
graph for a non-negative integer $k$, which generalizes the notion of a
word-representable graph. Under this representation, edges of $G$ are defined
by containing at most $k$ occurrences of the consecutive pattern $11$ in a word
representing $G$. Thus, word-representable graphs are precisely
$0$-$11$-representable graphs. Our key result in this paper is showing that any
graph is $2$-$11$-representable by a concatenation of permutations, which is
rather surprising taking into account that concatenation of permutations has
limited power in the case of $0$-$11$-representation. Also, we show that the
class of word-representable graphs, studied intensively in the literature, is
contained strictly in the class of $1$-$11$-representable graphs. Another
result that we prove is the fact that the class of interval graphs is precisely
the class of $1$-$11$-representable graphs that can be represented by uniform

the known fact that the class of circle graphs is precisely the class of

their ease of generation by V(D)J recombination. Here we show that even for
large cohorts the observed degree of sharing of TCR sequences between
individuals is well predicted by a model accounting for by the known
quantitative statistical biases in the generation process, together with a
simple model of thymic selection. Whether a sequence is shared by many
individuals is predicted to depend on the number of queried individuals and the
sampling depth, as well as on the sequence itself, in agreement with the data.
We introduce the degree of publicness conditional on the queried cohort size
and the size of the sampled repertoires. Based on these observations we propose
a public/private sequence classifier, `PUBLIC' (Public Universal Binary

different orders of contributions result in different detuning dependence of
the decoherence, which provides a way to identify the noise source. We find
that decoherence in a recent two-qubit experiment was dominated by the
tunneling noise from $1/f$ charge noise. The results illustrate the importance
of considering tunneling noise to design optimal operation of spin qubits.

requires an estimation of which effective dynamics are relevant. We propose a
machine learning approach to this coarse graining problem, where a maximum
entropy approximation is constructed that evolves slowly in time. The dynamical
model governing the approximation is expressed as a functional, allowing a
general treatment of spatial interactions. In contrast to typical machine
learning approaches which estimate the interaction parameters of a graphical
model, we derive Boltzmann-machine like learning algorithms to estimate
directly the functionals dictating the time evolution of these parameters. By
incorporating analytic solutions from simple reaction motifs, an efficient
simulation method is demonstrated for systems ranging from toy problems to
basic biologically relevant networks. The broadly applicable nature of our
approach to learning spatial dynamics suggests promising applications to
multiscale methods for spatial networks, as well as to further problems in
machine learning.

an eavesdropper is also a part of network, a proactive relay selection by the

is selected by the eavesdropper. A relay selection scheme is also proposed to
improve the secrecy of the system by minimizing the eavesdropping rate.
Performances of these schemes are compared with two passive eavesdropping
scenarios in which the eavesdropper performs selection and maximal ratio
combining on the relayed links. A realistic channel model with independent
non-identical links between nodes and direct links from the source to both the
destination and eavesdropper are assumed. Closed-form expressions for the
secrecy outage probability (SOP) of these schemes in Rayleigh fading channel

with the increase in the number of relays, but its diversity also remains

pertinent general principles, we focus primarily on two fully charged
50-monomer sequences with significantly different charge patterns. Each monomer
in our models occupies a single lattice site and all monomers interact via a

Monte Carlo sampling performed at multiple temperatures on ensembles of 300

Phase separation in the model systems is characterized by the emergence of a
large cluster connected by inter-monomer nearest-neighbor lattice contacts and
by large fluctuations in local polymer density. The simulated critical
temperatures, $T_{\rm cr}$, of phase separation for the two sequences differ
significantly, whereby the sequence with a more ""blocky"" charge pattern
exhibits a substantially higher propensity to phase separate. The trend is
consistent with our sequence-specific random-phase-approximation (RPA) polymer

distributions is tight and converges weakly to a limiting random variable W.
However, those works only describe W implicitly as the invariant measure of a

conjectured an explicit form for this exponent, which was insensitive to the
higher moments of the service distribution.

The water which in the undeformed (9,9) nanotubes is frozen, becomes liquid for
the distortion above a certain threshold. These water diffusion enhancement

training a single model which integrates acoustic and language model into a

decoding pipelines, large amount of transcribed acoustic data is usually
required, and traditional acoustic and language modelling techniques cannot be
utilized. In this paper, a novel modular training framework of E2E ASR is
proposed to separately train neural acoustic and language models during
training stage, while still performing end-to-end inference in decoding stage.
Here, an acoustics-to-phoneme model (A2P) and a phoneme-to-word model (P2W) are
trained using acoustic data and text data respectively. A phone synchronous
decoding (PSD) module is inserted between A2P and P2W to reduce sequence
lengths without precision loss. Finally, modules are integrated into an
acousticsto-word model (A2W) and jointly optimized using acoustic data to
retain the advantage of sequence modeling. Experiments on a 300- hour
Switchboard task show significant improvement over the direct A2W model. The
efficiency in both training and decoding also benefits from the proposed
method.

  (i) The write operation terminates if the number of server failures is
bounded by a parameter $f$. The algorithms also guarantee the termination of
the read as long as the number of writes concurrent with the read is smaller

$\sigma\sim2\rm{\,mJy\,beam}^{-1}$. We detect in total 49 sources at the
$4\sigma$ level, and conduct a detailed multi-wavelength analysis considering
our new radio and far-IR observations plus existing near-IR and optical data.
One source is identified as a foreground galaxy, 28 SMGs are matched to single
radio sources, 4 have double radio counterparts, and 16 are undetected at 2.1
GHz but tentatively associated in some cases to near-IR/optical sources. We
estimate photometric redshifts for 34 sources with secure (25) and tentative
(9) matches at different wavelengths, obtaining a median $z=2.8^{+2.1}_{-1.7}$.
Compared to previous results for single-dish surveys, our redshift distribution
has a comparatively larger fraction of sources at $z>3$ and the high-redshift
tail is more extended. This is consistent with millimeter spectroscopic
confirmation of a growing number of high-$z$ SMGs and relevant for testing of
cosmological models. Analytical lens modeling is applied to estimate
magnification factors for 42 SMGs at cluster-centric radii $>1.2$'; with the
demagnified flux densities and source-plane areas, we obtain integral number
counts that agree with previous submillimeter surveys.

oscillator system with a non-ideal capacitor were investigated. Here, the
capacitor was modeled, using a fractional differential equation in which the
order of the fractional derivative is also a measure of the memory in the
dielectric. The governing fractional differential equation was derived using
two methods, namely a differential and integral approach. The former method
utilized a hierarchical resistor-capacitor (RC) ladder model while the latter
utilized the theory of the universal dielectric-response. The dynamical
behavior of the potential across the capacitor was found to be affected by this
parameter, and, therefore, the memory of the system. Additionally, findings
indicate that an increase in the memory parameter was associated with an
increase in the energy stored in the dielectric. It was found that oscillation
death resulted in a higher amount of stored energy in the dielectric over time,
as compared to behavior, which displayed relaxation oscillations or chaotic
fluctuations. The relatively-lower stored energy resulting from the latter
types of dynamical behavior appeared to be a consequence of the memory effect,
where present accumulations of energy in the capacitor are affected by previous
decreases in the potential. Hence, in this type of scenario, the dielectric
material can be thought of as remembering the past behavior of the voltage,
which leads to either a decrease, or an enhancement in the stored energy. The
non-ideal capacitor was also found to have a transitory nature, where it
behaves more like a resistor as {\alpha} approaches 0, and conversely, more
like a capacitor as {\alpha} goes to 1. Here, a decrease in {\alpha} was linked
to an enhanced metallic character of the dielectric.

reconstructed image quality in proton computed tomography (pCT). The structure
of the TVS algorithm has evolved since then and this work investigated if this
new algorithmic structure provides additional benefits to pCT image quality.
Structural and parametric changes introduced to the original TVS algorithm
included: (1) inclusion or exclusion of TV reduction requirement, (2) a
variable number, $N$, of TV perturbation steps per feasibility-seeking
iteration, and (3) introduction of a perturbation kernel $0<\alpha<1$. The
structural change of excluding the TV reduction requirement check tended to
have a beneficial effect for $3\le N\le 6$ and allows full parallelization of
the TVS algorithm. Repeated perturbations per feasibility-seeking iterations
reduced total variation (TV) and material dependent standard deviations for
$3\le N\le 6$. The perturbation kernel $\alpha$, equivalent to $\alpha=0.5$ in
the original TVS algorithm, reduced TV and standard deviations as $\alpha$ was
increased beyond $\alpha=0.5$, but negatively impacted reconstructed relative
stopping power (RSP) values for $\alpha>0.75$. The reductions in TV and
standard deviations allowed feasibility-seeking with a larger relaxation
parameter $\lambda$ than previously used, without the corresponding increases
in standard deviations experienced with the original TVS algorithm. This work
demonstrates that the modifications related to the evolution of the original
TVS algorithm provide benefits in terms of both pCT image quality and
computational efficiency for appropriately chosen parameter values.

also be implications for a modified space-time structure. Quantum space-time
effects, however, are often ignored in this setting because they are not
obvious: they require a careful analysis of gauge transformations and the

non-classical gauge transformations in the presence of holonomy modifications.

the propagation properties of a quasi-periodic fast-propagating (QFP)
magnetosonic wave. The QFP wave was associated with the eruption of a nearby
mini-filament and a small B4 GOES flare, which may indicate that the generation
of a QFP wave do not need too much flare energy. The propagation of the QFP
wave was along a bundle of funnel-shaped open loops with a speed of about
1100+/-78, and an acceleration of -2.2+/-1.1. Periodicity analysis indicates
that the periods of the QFP wave are 43+/-6, 79+/-18 second. For the first
time, we find that the periods of the QFP wave and the accompanying flare are
inconsistent, which is different from the findings as reported in previous
studies. We propose that the present QFP wave was possibly caused by the
mechanism of dispersive evolution of an initially broadband disturbance
resulted from the nearby mini-filament eruption.

novel loss functions to conduct non-overlapping attack and targeted keyword

also archival sources (such as static areas of interest). To address the
problem of integrating data from such diverse sources, link discovery
techniques are required to identify various spatial relations efficiently.
Existing approaches typically adopt the filter and refine methodology by
exploiting a blocking technique for effective filtering.
  In this paper, we present a new spatial LD technique, called MaskLink, that
improves the effectiveness of the filtering step. We show that MaskLink
outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm for link discovery of topological

for streaming data, low memory requirements, and parallelization. Furthermore,
we show that MaskLink can be extended and generalized to the case of
proximity-based link discovery, which has not been studied before for spatial

  Our empirical study demonstrates the superiority of MaskLink against the

order of terabytes per driving hour, to support advanced automotive services.
This unprecedented amount of data to be exchanged goes beyond the capabilities

for new solutions. A possible answer to this growing demand for ultra-high
transmission speeds can be found in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands which,
however, are subject to high signal attenuation and challenging propagation
characteristics. In particular, mmWave links are typically directional, to
benefit from the resulting beamforming gain, and require precise alignment of
the transmitter and the receiver beams, an operation which may increase the
latency of the communication and lead to deafness due to beam misalignment. In
this paper, we propose a stochastic model for characterizing the beam coverage
and connectivity probability in mmWave automotive networks. The purpose is to
exemplify some of the complex and interesting tradeoffs that have to be
considered when designing solutions for vehicular scenarios based on mmWave
links. The results show that the performance of the automotive nodes in highly
mobile mmWave systems strictly depends on the specific environment in which the
vehicles are deployed, and must account for several automotive-specific

robustness. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel type of
aesthetic QR codes, SEE (Stylize aEsthEtic) QR code, and a three-stage approach
to automatically produce such robust style-oriented codes. Specifically, in the
first stage, we propose a method to generate an optimized baseline aesthetic QR
code, which reduces the visual contrast between the noise-like black/white
modules and the blended image. In the second stage, to obtain art style QR
code, we tailor an appropriate neural style transformation network to endow the
baseline aesthetic QR code with artistic elements. In the third stage, we
design an error-correction mechanism by balancing two competing terms, visual
quality and readability, to ensure the performance robust. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SEE QR code has high quality in terms of both
visual appearance and robustness, and also offers a greater variety of
personalized choices to users.

a behind-the-limb active region (N05E151). This burst was observed also by the
radio telescope NDA (Nancay Decameter Array) in the frequency band 30 - 60 MHz.
The purpose of the article is the determination of the source of this type IV
burst. After analysis of the observational data obtained with the URAN-2, NDA,
STEREO (Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory) A and B spacecraft, and SOHO
(Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)spacecraft we come to the conclusion that
it is a core of a behind-the-limb CME. We conclude that the radio emission can
escape the center of the CME core at a frequency of 60 MHz and originates from
the periphery of the core at frequency 30 MHz due to occultation by the solar
corona at corresponding frequencies. We find plasma densities in these regions
supposing the plasma mechanism of radio emission. We show that the frequency
drift of the start of the type IV burst is governed by an expansion of the CME
core. Type III bursts, which were observed against this type IV burst, are
shown to be generated by fast electrons propagating through the CME core
plasma. A type II burst registered at frequencies 44 - 64 MHz and 3 - 16 MHz
was radiated by a shock with a velocity of about 1000 km s^{-1} and 800 km
s^{-1}, respectively.

corresponding to different illumination apertures are combined to obtain an
optimally synthesized frequency response, achieving high-quality, low-noise 3D

Besides, the 3D imaging performance of annular illumination is explored and the
expression of 3D POTF for arbitrary illumination pupils is derived and
analyzed. It is shown that the phase-contrast washout effect in high-NA
circular apertures can be effectively addressed by introducing a complementary
annular aperture, which strongly boosts the phase contrast and improves the
practical imaging resolution. To test the feasibility of the proposed OFC-ODT

effective spherically symmetric polymer models inspired by Loop Quantum
Gravity. When one takes into account the anomaly free point-wise holonomy
quantum corrections, the modification of Einstein equations is parametrized by
a function $f(x)$ of one phase space variable. We solve explicitly these
equations for a static interior black hole geometry and find the effective
metric describing the trapped region, inside the black hole, for any $f(x)$.
This general resolution allows to take into account a standard ambiguity
inherent to the polymer regularization: namely the choice of the spin $j$
labelling the SU$(2)$-representation of the holonomy corrections. When $j=1/2$,
the function $f(x)$ is the usual sine function used in the polymer litterature.
For this simple case, the effective exterior metric remains the classical
Schwarzschild's one but acquires modifications inside the hole. The interior
metric describes a regular trapped region and presents strong similarities with
the Reissner-Nordstr\""om metric, with a new inner horizon generated by quantum
effects. We discuss the gluing of our interior solution to the exterior
Schwarzschild metric and the challenge to extend the solution outside the
trapped region due to covariance requirement. By starting from the anomaly free
polymer regularization for inhomogeneous spherically symmetric geometry, and
then reducing to the homogeneous interior problem, we provide an alternative
treatment to existing polymer interior black hole models which focus directly
on the interior geometry, ignoring covariance issue when introducing the
polymer regularization.

There are numerous ways in which content and interactivity can be distributed.
However, good solutions must consider multiple users, their roles, their
preferences and access rights, as well as device capabilities. Manual and
rule-based solutions are tedious to create and do not scale to larger problems
nor do they adapt to dynamic changes, such as users leaving or joining an
activity. In this paper, we cast the problem of UI distribution as an
assignment problem and propose to solve it using combinatorial optimization. We
present a mixed integer programming formulation which allows real-time
applications in dynamically changing collaborative settings. It optimizes the
allocation of UI elements based on device capabilities, user roles,
preferences, and access rights. We present a proof-of-concept
designer-in-the-loop tool, allowing for quick solution exploration. Finally, we
compare our approach to traditional paper prototyping in a lab study.

rise to a rich class of non-equilibrium phenomena with the emergence of
non-trivial phases. In this paper, we investigate this interplay of dynamics in
a model of interacting spins with infinite range interactions described by
Heisenberg interaction. Using Holestien-Primarkoff transformations, the spin
model is bosonized to a collective mode with self interaction at $\frac{1}{N}$
order. Employing Keldysh field theoretic technique with saddle point
approximation, we see that the system breaks $\mathcal{Z}_2$-symmetry at the
transition point. An effective temperature arises due to dissipation which
depends linearly on effective system-bath coupling, and is independent of the
dissipation rate and cutoff frequency of the bath with Drude-Lorentz cutoff in
wide class of bath spectral densities. Furthermore, fluctuations over mean
field are studied and is shown that the dissipative spectrum is modified by
${\rm O}(\frac{1}{N})$ correction term which results change in various

circuits at different antennas at the BS break the end-to-end UL and DL channel
reciprocity. To restore the channel reciprocity, it is necessary to calibrate
all the antennas at the BS. This paper addresses the interconnection strategy
for the internal self-calibration at the BS where different antennas are
interconnected via hardware transmission lines. Specifically, the paper reveals
the optimality of the star interconnection and the daisy chain interconnection
respectively. From the results, we see the star interconnection is the optimal

On the other hand, the daisy chain interconnection outperforms the star

Monte Carlo simulations and stochastic analytic continuation of imaginary-time

overabundance of singles has lead to the suggestion that up to half of Kepler
systems might possess significant mutual inclinations between orbits, reducing
the transiting number (the so-called ""Kepler Dichotomy""). In a recent paper,
Spalding & Batygin (2016) demonstrated that the quadrupole moment arising from
a young, oblate star is capable of misaligning the constituent orbits of a
close-in planetary system enough to reduce their transit number, provided that
the stellar spin axis is sufficiently misaligned with respect to the planetary
orbital plane. Moreover, tightly packed planetary systems were shown to be
susceptible to becoming destabilized during this process. Here, we investigate
the ubiquity of the stellar obliquity-driven instability within systems with a
range of multiplicities. We find that most planetary systems analysed,
including those possessing only 2 planets, underwent instability for stellar
spin periods below ~3 days and stellar tilts of order 30 degrees. Moreover, we
are able to place upper limits on the stellar obliquity in systems such as
K2-38 (obliquity <20 degrees), where other methods of measuring spin-orbit
misalignment are not currently available. Given the known parameters of T-Tauri

is necessary. We propose a two-stage optimization model that optimizes

time-varying coefficients. The method of sieves is utilized for the estimation
and is shown to be efficient and optimally adaptive in terms of estimation
accuracy and computational complexity. We establish an asymptotic theory for a
class of ${\cal L}^2$ tests based on the nonparametric sieve estimators. The

banded. A high dimensional Gaussian approximation result is established for a
wide class of quadratic form of non-stationary and nonlinear processes, which

By employing the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we propose a general

interaction between gap plasmons and molecular exciton leads to a prominent
Fano resonance in the emission spectrum. We analyze the dependence of the Fano

is considered for models with a number of particles $N \sim 10^5 \div 10^7$. By
means of $N$-body simulations of gravitationally unstable stellar galactic we
have investigated the algorithms parallelization efficiency for various Nvidia
Tesla graphics processors~(K20, K40, K80). Particular attention was paid to the
parallel performance of simulations and accuracy of the numerical solution by
comparing single and double floating-point precisions~(SP and DP). We showed
that the double-precision simulations are slower by a factor of~$1.7$ than the
single-precision runs performed on Nvidia Tesla K-Series processors. We also
claim that application of the single-precision operations leads to incorrect
result in the evolution of the non-axisymmetric gravitating $N$-body systems.
In particular, it leads to significant quantitative and even qualitative
distortions in the galactic disk evolution. For instance, after $10^4$
integration time steps for the single-precision numbers the total energy,
momentum, and angular momentum of a system with $N = 2^{20}$ conserve with
accuracy of $10^{-3}$, $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-3}$ respectively, in comparison to
the double-precision simulations these values are $10^{-5}$, $10^{-15}$ and
$10^{-13}$, respectively. Our estimations evidence in favour of usage of the
second-order accuracy schemes with double-precision numbers since it is more
efficient than in the fourth-order schemes with single-precision numbers.

interesting type-theoretic structure known as `identity type'. The idea is
that, given terms $a,b$ of a type $A$, one may form the type $Id_{A}(a,b)$,
whose elements are proofs that $a$ and $b$ are equal elements of type $A$. A
term of this type, $p : Id_{A}(a,b)$, makes up for the grounds (or proof) that
establishes that $a$ is indeed equal to $b$. Based on that, a proof of equality
can be seen as a sequence of substitutions and rewrites, also known as a
`computational path'. One interesting fact is that it is possible to rewrite
computational paths using a set of reduction rules arising from an analysis of
redundancies in paths. These rules were mapped by De Oliveira in 1994 in a term
rewrite system known as $LND_{EQ}-TRS$. Here we use computational paths and
this term rewrite system to work with path spaces. In homotopy type theory, the

straightforward than the code-encode-decode one. We then use our approach to

performed on short time magnitude as well phase spectra is presented. Unlike
the conventional geometric approach (GA) to spectral subtraction (SS), here the
noise estimate to be subtracted from the noisy speech spectrum is proposed to
be determined by exploiting the low frequency regions of current frame of noisy
speech rather than depending only on the initial silence frames. This approach
gives the capability of tracking non-stationary noise thus resulting in a
non-stationary noise-driven geometric approach of spectral subtraction for
speech enhancement. The noise compensated magnitude spectrum from the GA step
is then recombined with unchanged phase of noisy speech spectrum and used in
phase compensation to obtain an enhanced complex spectrum, which is used to
produce an enhanced speech frame. Extensive simulations are carried out using
speech files available in the NOIZEUS database shows that the proposed method
consistently outperforms some of the recent methods of speech enhancement when
employed on the noisy speeches corrupted by street or babble noise at different
levels of SNR in terms of objective measures, spectrogram analysis and formal
subjective listening tests.

  Tomography Data",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tomography is an imaging technique that works by reconstructing a scene from
acquired data in the form of line integrals of the imaging domain. A
fundamental underlying assumption in the reconstruction procedure is the
precise alignment of the data values, i.e. the relationship between the data
values and the paths of the lines of integration is accurately known. In many
applications, e.g. electron and X-ray tomography, it is necessary to establish
this relationship using software alignment techniques or image registration due
to misalignment when rotating the physical specimen. Unfortunately, highly
accurate software alignment is still a challenge to achieve in many cases, and
improper alignment results in severe loss in the imaging resolution. In this
article, we develop a new approach that considers the alignment problem through
a completely different lens, as a problem of recovering phase shifts in Fourier
domain {within} the reconstruction algorithm. The recovery of these phase
shifts serves as the data alignment, which is done by calculating discrepancies
between the misaligned data and the current reconstruction. In the development
of the approach, we investigate proper selection of parameters, and we show
that it is fairly flexible and surprisingly accurate. Finally, the analysis of
our approach provides insight into why projection matching alignment by
cross-correlation can be improved through low pass filtering, which we
demonstrate. Our methods are validated in a wide range of examples and
settings.

  Particle Filter for Visual Tracking","10 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1703.05020 by
  other authors",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel structural correlation filter combined with
a multi-task Gaussian particle filter (KCF-GPF) model for robust visual
tracking. We first present an assemble structure where several KCF trackers as
weak experts provide a preliminary decision for a Gaussian particle filter to
make a final decision. The proposed method is designed to exploit and
complement the strength of a KCF and a Gaussian particle filter. Compared with
the existing tracking methods based on correlation filters or particle filters,
the proposed tracker has several advantages. First, it can detect the tracked
target in a large-scale search scope via weak KCF trackers and evaluate the
reliability of weak trackers\rq decisions for a Gaussian particle filter to
make a strong decision, and hence it can tackle fast motions, appearance
variations, occlusions and re-detections. Second, it can effectively handle
large-scale variations via a Gaussian particle filter. Third, it can be
amenable to fully parallel implementation using importance sampling without
resampling, thereby it is convenient for VLSI implementation and can lower the
computational costs. Extensive experiments on the OTB-2013 dataset containing
50 challenging sequences demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs
favourably against 16 state-of-the-art trackers.

to gather information, monitor health condition and provide support, especially
after hospital discharge or at-home settings. Several smart devices have been
delivered by digital health, bundled with telemedicine systems, smartphone and
other digital services. While such solutions offer personalised data and
suggestions, the real disruptive step comes from the interaction of new digital
ecosystem, represented by chatbots. Chatbots will play a leading role by
embodying the function of a virtual assistant and bridging the gap between
patients and clinicians. Powered by AI and machine learning algorithms,
chatbots are forecasted to save healthcare costs when used in place of a human
or assist them as a preliminary step of helping to assess a condition and
providing self-care recommendations. This paper describes integrating chatbots
into telemedicine systems intended for elderly patient after their hospital
discharge. The paper discusses possible ways to utilise chatbots to assist

  Energy",,,,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Various types of equilibrium processes involve electric fields. In some
cases, the electrical energy appears to be negative (e.g. if the voltage is
fixed by an external source). This paper explains how to derive the correct
thermo-dynamic potential for electro-static phenomena, whether the voltage is
fixed, or the charge is fixed, or some combination is fixed. In particular, we
explain, in complete detail, why fixing the voltage introduces ""a minus sign""
in the electrical energy.
  Two explanations are given. The first explanation is based on a
lumped-parameter argument (i.e. a lumped-capacitor model). The second
explanation uses a distributed parameter model (i.e. a partial differential
equation (PDE) model) of a dielectric medium, in this case, we allow for
non-linearity and external polarization effects. Connections with Legendre
(duality) transforms are also discussed.
