simplest such continuous 1D quantum system is the Kerr oscillator. It has a
number of interesting symmetries we derive. Its quantum dynamics is best
studied in phase space, using Wigner's distribution W and the associated Wigner
phase space current J. Expressions for the continuity equation governing its
time evolution are derived in terms of J and it is shown that J for Kerr
oscillators follows circles in phase space. Using J we also show that the
evolution's classical shear in phase space is quantum suppressed by an
effective `viscosity'. Quantifying this shear suppression provides measures to
contrast classical with quantum evolution and allows us to identify special
quantum states.

introduce a two-dimensional implementation of the combined finite-discrete
element method (FDEM), which merges the finite element method (FEM) and the
discrete element method (DEM), to explicitly simulate the crack induced
nonlinear elasticity in solids with both horizontal and inclined cracks. In the
FDEM model, the solid is discretized into finite elements to capture the wave
propagation in the bulk material, and the finite elements along the two sides
of the crack also behave as discrete elements to track the normal and
tangential interactions between crack surfaces. The simulation results show
that for cracked models, nonlinear elasticity is generated only when the
excitation amplitude is large enough to trigger the contact between crack
surfaces, and the nonlinear behavior is very sensitive to the crack surface
contact. The simulations reveal the influence of normal and tangential contact
on the nonlinear elasticity generation. Moreover, the results demonstrate the
capabilities of FDEM for decoding the causality of nonlinear elasticity in
cracked solid and its potential to assist in Non-Destructive Testing (NDT).

any perceptible footprints of rank-2 antisymmetric tensor fields? (generally
known as Kalb-Ramond fields) is addressed. A quite natural explanation of this
issue is given from the angle of higher-curvature gravity, both in four- and in
five-dimensional spacetime. The results here obtained reveal that the amplitude
of the Kalb-Ramond field may be actually large and play a significant role
during the early universe, while the presence of higher-order gravity
suppresses this field during the cosmological evolution, so that it eventually
becomes negligible in the current universe. Besides the suppression of the
Kalb-Ramond field, the extra degree of freedom in $F(R)$ gravity, usually known
as scalaron, also turns out to be responsible for inflation. Such F(R) gravity
with Kalb-Ramond fields may govern the early universe to undergo an
inflationary stage at early times (with the subsequent graceful exit) for wider
range of F(R) gravity than without antisymmetric fields.. Furthermore, the
models---in four- and five-dimensional spacetimes---are linked to observational
constraints, with the conclusion that the corresponding values of the spectral
index and tensor-to-scalar ratio closely match the values provided by the

of individual predictors. At the same time, additional information on the
predictors is available in many applications but left unused. Here, we propose
to make use of such external covariates to adapt the penalization in a
data-driven manner. We present a method that differentially penalizes feature
groups defined by the covariates and adapts the relative strength of
penalization to the information content of each group. Using techniques from
the Bayesian tool-set our procedure combines shrinkage with feature selection
and provides a scalable optimization scheme. We demonstrate in simulations that
the method accurately recovers the true effect sizes and sparsity patterns per
feature group. Furthermore, it leads to an improved prediction performance in
situations where the groups have strong differences in dynamic range. In
applications to data from high-throughput biology, the method enables
re-weighting the importance of feature groups from different assays. Overall,
using available covariates extends the range of applications of penalized
regression, improves model interpretability and can improve prediction
performance. We provide an open-source implementation of the method in the R

decompose the total radio 1.4 GHz luminosity ($\mathrm{L_{1.4\ GHz,TOT}}$) into
the emission originating from star formation and AGN activity by measuring the
excess in $\mathrm{L_{1.4\ GHz,TOT}}$ relative to the infrared-radio
correlation of star-forming galaxies. To quantify the excess, for each source
we calculate the AGN fraction ($\mathrm{f_{AGN}}$), the fractional contribution
of AGN activity to $\mathrm{L_{1.4\ GHz,TOT}}$. The majority of the HLAGN,
$(68.0\pm1.5)\%$, are dominated by star-forming processes ($f_{AGN}\leq0.5$),
while $(32.0\pm1.5)\%$ are dominated by AGN-related radio emission
($0.5<f_{AGN}\leq1$). We use the AGN-related 1.4 GHz emission to derive the 1.4
GHz AGN luminosity functions of HLAGN. By assuming pure density and pure
luminosity evolution models we constrain their cosmic evolution out to
$z\sim6$, finding $\mathrm{\Phi^* (z) \propto

the number and luminosity density of HLAGN increased from higher redshifts
($z\sim6$) up to a maximum in the redshift range $ 1<z<2.5$, followed by a
decline towards local values. By scaling the 1.4 GHz AGN luminosity to kinetic
luminosity using the standard conversion, we estimate the kinetic luminosity
density as a function of redshift. We compare our result to the semi-analytic
models of radio mode feedback finding that this feedback could have played an
important role in the context of AGN-host coevolution in HLAGN which show
evidence of AGN-related radio emission ($f_{AGN}>0$).

extended as the CO gas. However, two galaxies have central continuum ALMA

Serendipitous continuum detections further away in the ALMA field are found in
another case. Large and massive rotating molecular gas disks are mapped in

a combined phenomenological analysis of RHIC data on transverse single-spin
asymmetries in $p^\uparrow p\to \pi\, X$ and $p^\uparrow p\to D\, X$, putting
the first preliminary constraints on these two gluon Sivers functions. We show
how their size can be estimated by means of these data, and use our results to
provide predictions for the process $p^\uparrow p\to J/\psi\,X$, comparing them
with data, and $p^\uparrow p\to \gamma\, X$, for which experimental information
will soon become available. Corresponding estimates within the simpler GPM
approach, without initial and final state interactions and with a single
universal gluon Sivers function, are also given, showing that a clear
discrimination between these two models is, for the moment, not possible.

quadratic nonlinearity of stationary processes. However, it is often applied
without checking the basic assumptions of stationarity and convergence. The
classic bicoherence, unfortunately, tends to give false positives -- high
bicoherence values without actual nonlinear coupling of different frequency
components -- for signals exhibiting rapidly changing amplitudes and limited
length. The effect of false positive values can lead to misinterpretation of
results, therefore a more prudent analysis is necessary in such cases. This
paper analyses the properties of bispectrum and bicoherence in detail,
generalizing these quantities to nonstationary processes. A step-by-step method
is proposed to filter out false positives at a given confidence level for the
case of nonstationary signals. We present a number of test cases, where the
method is demonstrated on simple physics-based numerical systems. The approach
and methodology introduced in the paper can be generalized to lower and higher

transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted a lot of attention in
recent years, thanks to the sizeable transition temperature, robustness against
in-plane magnetic fields beyond the Pauli limit, and hints to a
non-conventional nature of the pairing. A key information necessary to unveil
its microscopic origin is the geometry of the Fermi surface hosting the Cooper
pairs as a function of field-effect doping, which is dictated by the filling of
the inequivalent valleys at the K/K$^{\prime}$ and Q/Q$^{\prime}$ points of the
Brillouin Zone. Here, we achieve this by combining Density Functional Theory
calculations of the bandstructure with transport measurements on ion-gated
2H-MoS$_{2}$ nanolayers. We show that, when the number of layers and the amount
of strain are set to their experimental values, the Fermi level crosses the
bottom of the high-energy valleys at Q/Q$^{\prime}$ at doping levels where
characteristic kinks in the transconductance are experimentally detected. We
also develop a simple 2D model which is able to quantitatively describe the
broadening of the kinks observed upon increasing temperature. We demonstrate
that this combined approach can be employed to map the dependence of the Fermi
surface of TMD nanolayers on field-effect doping, detect Lifshitz transitions,
and provide a method to determine the amount of strain and spin-orbit splitting

can fail to accurately represent the way an assembly stack actually operates.
Indeed, one may want to access the part of the memory that is below the current
stack or base pointer, hence the need for a model that keeps track of this part
of the memory.
  To this end, we introduce pushdown systems with an upper stack (UPDSs), an
extension of PDSs where symbols popped from the stack are not destroyed but
instead remain just above its top, and may be overwritten by later push rules.
We prove that the sets of successors post* and predecessors pre* of a regular
set of configurations of such a system are not always regular, but that post*
is context-sensitive, so that we can decide whether a single configuration is
forward reachable or not.
  In order to under-approximate pre* in a regular fashion, we consider a
bounded-phase analysis of UPDSs, where a phase is a part of a run during which
either push or pop rules are forbidden. We then present a method to
over-approximate post* that relies on regular abstractions of runs of UPDSs.
Finally, we show how these approximations can be used to detect stack overflows
and stack pointer manipulations with malicious intent.

addition of only 8% Sm does. The significant effect of Sm doping was related to
the intolerance of Al to this dopant. This leads to increase in the

quark is the only Standard Model fermion to get mass directly from a tree level
renormalizable Yukawa interaction, while neutrinos are unique in that they get
calculable radiative masses through a low-scale seesaw mechanism. The scheme
has generalized $\mu-\tau$ symmetry and leads to a restricted range of neutrino
oscillations parameters, with a nonzero neutrinoless double beta decay
amplitude lying at the upper ranges generically associated to normal and
inverted neutrino mass ordering.

  Tree: A Tight Quasi-Polynomial-Time Algorithm",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the Directed Steiner Tree (DST) problem we are given an $n$-vertex
directed edge-weighted graph, a root $r$, and a collection of $k$ terminal
nodes. Our goal is to find a minimum-cost arborescence that contains a directed
path from $r$ to every terminal. We present an $O(\log^2
k/\log\log{k})$-approximation algorithm for DST that runs in
quasi-polynomial-time. By adjusting the parameters in the hardness result of
Halperin and Krauthgamer, we show the matching lower bound of
$\Omega(\log^2{k}/\log\log{k})$ for the class of quasi-polynomial-time
algorithms. This is the first improvement on the DST problem since the
classical quasi-polynomial-time $O(\log^3 k)$ approximation algorithm by
Charikar et al. (The paper erroneously claims an $O(\log^2k)$ approximation due
to a mistake in prior work.)
  Our approach is based on two main ingredients. First, we derive an
approximation preserving reduction to the Label-Consistent Subtree (LCST)
problem. The LCST instance has quasi-polynomial size and logarithmic height. We
remark that, in contrast, Zelikovsky's heigh-reduction theorem used in all
prior work on DST achieves a reduction to a tree instance of the related Group
Steiner Tree (GST) problem of similar height, however losing a logarithmic
factor in the approximation ratio. Our second ingredient is an LP-rounding
algorithm to approximately solve LCST instances, which is inspired by the
framework developed by Rothvo{\ss}. We consider a Sherali-Adams lifting of a
proper LP relaxation of LCST. Our rounding algorithm proceeds level by level
from the root to the leaves, rounding and conditioning each time on a proper
subset of label variables. A small enough (namely, polylogarithmic) number of
Sherali-Adams lifting levels is sufficient to condition up to the leaves.

actions can either be externally directed, such as opening a door, or
internally directed, such as writing data to a memory location or strengthening
a synaptic connection. Some internal actions, to which we refer as
computations, potentially help the agent choose better actions. Considering
that (external) actions and computations might draw upon the same resources,
such as time and energy, deciding when to act or compute, as well as what to
compute, are detrimental to the performance of an agent.
  In an environment that provides rewards depending on an agent's behavior, an
action's value is typically defined as the sum of expected long-term rewards
succeeding the action (itself a complex quantity that depends on what the agent
goes on to do after the action in question). However, defining the value of a
computation is not as straightforward, as computations are only valuable in a
higher order way, through the alteration of actions.
  This thesis offers a principled way of computing the value of a computation
in a planning setting formalized as a Markov decision process. We present two
different definitions of computation values: static and dynamic. They address
two extreme cases of the computation budget: affording calculation of zero or
infinitely many steps in the future. We show that these values have desirable
properties, such as temporal consistency and asymptotic convergence.
  Furthermore, we propose methods for efficiently computing and approximating
the static and dynamic computation values. We describe a sense in which the
policies that greedily maximize these values can be optimal. We utilize these
principles to construct Monte Carlo tree search algorithms that outperform most
of the state-of-the-art in terms of finding higher quality actions given the

example of the principles of quantum physics. Mechanical oscillators, despite

GHz-frequency nano-scale oscillators has allowed experimenters to prepare such
states at milli-Kelvin temperatures. These developments illustrate the tension
between the basic predictions of quantum mechanics that should apply to all
mechanical oscillators existing even at ambient conditions, and the complex
experiments in extreme conditions required to observe those predictions. We
resolve the tension by creating a single Fock state of a vibration mode of a
crystal at room temperature using a technique that can be applied to any
Raman-active system. After exciting a bulk diamond with a femtosecond laser
pulse and detecting a Stokes-shifted photon, the 40~THz Raman-active internal
vibrational mode is prepared in the Fock state $|1>$ with $98.5\%$ probability.
The vibrational state is read out by a subsequent pulse, which when subjected
to a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss intensity correlation measurement reveals the
sub-Poisson number statistics of the vibrational mode. By controlling the delay
between the two pulses we are able to witness the decay of the vibrational Fock
state over its $3.9$ ps lifetime at room temperature. Our technique is agnostic
to specific selection rules, and should thus be applicable to any Raman-active
medium, opening a new generic approach to the experimental study of quantum
effects related to vibrational degrees of freedom in molecules and solid-state

  Translation (2018) 173-180",,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data selection techniques applied to neural machine translation (NMT) aim to
increase the performance of a model by retrieving a subset of sentences for use
as training data.
  One of the possible data selection techniques are transductive learning
methods, which select the data based on the test set, i.e. the document to be
translated. A limitation of these methods to date is that using the source-side
test set does not by itself guarantee that sentences are selected with correct
translations, or translations that are suitable given the test-set domain. Some
corpora, such as subtitle corpora, may contain parallel sentences with
inaccurate translations caused by localization or length restrictions.
  In order to try to fix this problem, in this paper we propose to use an
approximated target-side in addition to the source-side when selecting suitable
sentence-pairs for training a model. This approximated target-side is built by
pre-translating the source-side.
  In this work, we explore the performance of this general idea for one
specific data selection approach called Feature Decay Algorithms (FDA).
  We train German-English NMT models on data selected by using the test set
(source), the approximated target side, and a mixture of both. Our findings
reveal that models built using a combination of outputs of FDA (using the test
set and an approximated target side) perform better than those solely using the
test set. We obtain a statistically significant improvement of more than 1.5
BLEU points over a model trained with all data, and more than 0.5 BLEU points
over a strong FDA baseline that uses source-side information only.

gravitational wave detection (GW 150914) was the fact the black holes (BHs)
were ""heavy"", of order 30 - 40 solar masses. The most promising explanation for
this obesity is that the BH-BH merger occurred at low metallicity (Z): when the
iron (Fe) contents is lower this is expected to result in weaker mass loss
during the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase. We therefore critically evaluate the claims
for the reasons of heavy BHs as a function of Z in the literature. Furthermore,
weaker stellar winds might lead to more rapid stellar rotation, allowing WR and
BH progenitor evolution in a chemically homogeneous manner. However, there is
as yet no empirical evidence for more rapid rotation amongst WR stars in the
low Z environment of the Magellanic Clouds. Due to the intrinsic challenge of
determining WR rotation rates from emission lines, the most promising avenue to
constrain rotation-rate distributions amongst various WR subgroups is through
the utilisation of their emission lines in polarised light. We thus provide an
overview of linear spectro-polarimetry observations of both single and binary
WRs in the Galaxy, as well as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, at 50% and
20% of solar Z, respectively. Initial results suggest that the route of
chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) through stellar rotation is challenging,
whilst the alternative of a post-LBV or common envelope evolution is more
likely.

energy dissipation and forms a characteristic spectrum of fast ions streaming
away from the interface. We show that the derived decay function of the field
is in accordance with model predictions of the accelerating field structure.

report a significant drag increase and an enhancement of the turbulence
activity with growing wall elasticity for both single-phase and particulate
cases in comparison with the single-phase flow over rigid walls. A drag
reduction and a turbulence attenuation is obtained for the particulate cases
with highly elastic walls, albeit with respect to the single-phase flow of the
same wall elasticity; whereas, an opposite effect of the particles is observed
on the flow of the less elastic walls. This is explained by investigating the
near-wall turbulence of highly elastic walls, where the strong asymmetry in the
magnitude of wall-normal velocity fluctuations (favouring the positive), is
found to push the particles towards the channel centre. The particle layer
close to the wall is shown to contribute to the turbulence production by
increasing the wall-normal velocity fluctuations, while in the absence of this
layer, smaller wall deformation and in turn a turbulence attenuation is
observed. We further address the effect of the volume fraction at a moderate
wall elasticity, by increasing the particle volume fraction up to 20%.
Migration of the particles from the interface region is found to be the cause
of a further turbulence attenuation, in comparison to the same volume fraction
in the case of rigid walls. However, the particle induced stress compensates
for the loss of the Reynolds shear stress, thus, resulting in a higher overall
drag for the case with elastic walls. The effect of wall-elasticity on the drag
is reported to reduce significantly with increasing volume fraction of

Sciences on Kaluza's five-dimensional theory. In his Einstein biography,
Abraham Pais asserted that he could not understand the reasons that pushed
Einstein to communicate his work. Indeed, Einstein's paper seems to be very
close to Oskar Klein's approach, published in 1926. The question seems to be
yet unanswered, also in recent works. We analysed the differences between
Einstein's and Klein's work and we propose a new interpretation of Einstein's
approach. In 1927, he tried to use Weyl's scale invariance in order to
construct a theory covering macroscopic as well as microscopic phenomena. In
constructing a five-dimensional action, Einstein used in a modern way the idea
of ``gauge invariance''. Furthermore, we propose an additional motivation for
the fact that he did not mention Klein's and Vladimir Fock's contributions in
his first communication and we show further evidences which would confirm also
Paul Halpern's recent proposal. As a consequence of our interpretation of the
role of conformal transformations, we suggest that in 1927 Einstein did not
consider the fifth dimension as real and that his approach, unlike Klein's
attempt, cannot be considered inconsistent.

within a dense core in the isolated dark cloud BHR71. The pair of protostars,
IRS1 and IRS2, are both in the Class 0 phase, determined from observations that
resolve the sources from 1 um out to 250 um and from 1.3 mm to 1.3cm. The
resolved observations enable the luminosities of IRS1 and IRS2 to be
independently measured (14.7 and 1.7L_sun, respectively), in addition to the
bolometric temperatures 68~K, and 38~K, respectively. The surrounding core was
mapped in NH3 (1,1) with the Parkes radio telescope, and followed with
higher-resolution observations from ATCA in NH3 (1,1) and 1.3cm continuum. The
protostars were then further characterized with ALMA observations in the 1.3~mm
continuum along with N2D+ (J=3-2), 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (J=2-1) molecular
lines. The Parkes observations find evidence for a velocity gradient across the
core surrounding the two protostars, while ATCA reveals more complex velocity
structure toward the protostars within the large-scale gradient. The ALMA
observations then reveal that the two protostars are at the same velocity in
C18O, and N2H+ exhibits a similar velocity structure as NH3. However, the C18O
kinematics reveal that the rotation on scales $<$1000~AU around IRS1 and IRS2
are in opposite directions. Taken with the lack of a systematic velocity
difference between the pair, it is unlikely that their formation resulted from
rotational fragmentation. We instead conclude that the binary system most
likely formed via turbulent fragmentation of the core.

interpret our observations with a grid of models. The CN emission morphology is
discussed for two primordial disks, Sz 71 and Sz 98, and modeled in more

previous surveys. Models constructed with the physico-chemical code DALI are
used to study the integrated fluxes of the disks and resolved emission of CN in
disks without (dust) substructures. We find that CN N=3-2 is bright, and
detected in 38% of sources, but its disk-integrated flux is not strongly
correlated to either $^{13}$CO or continuum flux. Compared to pre-ALMA
single-dish surveys, no significant difference in the CN flux distributions in
Lupus and Taurus-Auriga is found, although $\rho$ Ophiuchus disks may be
fainter on average. We find ring-shaped CN emission with peak radii of ~50 AU
in two resolved disks. We conclude that a large fraction of sources is faint in
CN; only exponential gas surface density cutoffs at $R_{c} \leq 15$ AU can
reconcile observations with models. This is the first observational evidence of
such a compact gas disk population in Lupus. Absolute intensities and the
emission morphology of CN are reproduced by DALI models without the need for
any continuum substructure; they are unrelated to the CO snowline location.
These observations and the successful modeling of these rings provide a new
probe of the structure and conditions in disks, and particularly their incident
UV radiation field, if disk size is determined by the data.

eccentricities in the inner regions of a black hole accretion disc may explain
the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the
emission of Galactic X-ray binaries. However, it has been suggested that strong
vertical magnetic fields push the oscillations' trapping region toward the
innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), where conditions could be unfavourable
for their excitation. This paper explores the effects of large-scale magnetic
fields that exhibit \textit{both} toroidal and vertical components, through
local and global linear analyses. We find that a strong toroidal magnetic field
can reduce the detrimental effects of a vertical field: in fact, the isolation
of the trapping region from the ISCO may be restored by toroidal magnetic
fields approaching thermal strengths. The toroidal field couples the r-modes to
the disc's magneto-acoustic response and inflates the effective pressure within
the oscillations. As a consequence, the restoring force associated with the
vertical magnetic field's tension is reduced. Given the analytical and
numerical evidence that accretion discs threaded by poloidal magnetic field
lines develop a strong toroidal component, our result provides further evidence
that the detrimental effects of magnetic fields on trapped inertial modes are
not as great as previously thought.

  Constraint in the Adaptive Complexity Model",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study submodular maximization under a matroid constraint in
the adaptive complexity model. This model was recently introduced in the
context of submodular optimization in [BS18a] to quantify the information
theoretic complexity of black-box optimization in a parallel computation model.
Informally, the adaptivity of an algorithm is the number of sequential rounds
it makes when each round can execute polynomially-many function evaluations in
parallel. Since submodular optimization is regularly applied on large datasets
we seek algorithms with low adaptivity to enable speedups via parallelization.
Consequently, a recent line of work has been devoted to designing constant
factor approximation algorithms for maximizing submodular functions under
various constraints in the adaptive complexity model [BS18a, BS18b, BBS18,
BRS19, EN19, FMZ19, CQ19, ENV18, FMZ18].
  Despite the burst in work on submodular maximization in the adaptive
complexity model the fundamental problem of maximizing a monotone submodular
function under a matroid constraint has remained elusive. In particular, all
known techniques fail for this problem and there are no known constant factor
approximation algorithms whose adaptivity is sublinear in the rank of the
matroid $k$ or in the worst case sublinear in the size of the ground set $n$.
  In this paper we present an approximation algorithm for the problem of
maximizing a monotone submodular function under a matroid constraint in the
adaptive complexity model. The approximation guarantee of the algorithm is
arbitrarily close to the optimal $1-1/e$ and it has near optimal adaptivity of
$O(\log(n)\log(k))$. This result is obtained using a novel technique of
adaptive sequencing which departs from previous techniques for submodular
maximization in the adaptive complexity model.

cosmic times is essential to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With
the advent of numerous ground-based and space-borne instruments launched over
the past few decades we now have exquisite multi-wavelength observations of
galaxies from the FUV to the radio domain. To tap into this mine of data and
obtain new insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is
essential that we are able to extract information from their SED. Aims. We
present a completely new implementation of CIGALE. Written in python, its main
aims are to easily and efficiently model the FUV to radio spectrum of galaxies
and estimate their physical properties such as star formation rate,
attenuation, dust luminosity, stellar mass, and many other physical quantities.
Methods. To compute the spectral models, CIGALE builds composite stellar
populations from simple stellar populations combined with highly flexible star
formation histories, calculates the emission from gas ionised by massive stars,
and attenuates both the stars and the ionised gas with a highly flexible
attenuation curve. Based on an energy balance principle, the absorbed energy is
then re-emitted by the dust in the mid- and far-infrared domains while thermal
and non-thermal components are also included, extending the spectrum far into
the radio range. A large grid of models is then fitted to the data and the
physical properties are estimated through the analysis of the likelihood
distribution. Results. CIGALE is a versatile and easy-to-use tool that makes
full use of the architecture of multi-core computers, building grids of
millions of models and analysing samples of thousands of galaxies, both at high
speed. Beyond fitting the SEDs of galaxies and parameter estimations, it can
also be used as a model-generation tool or serve as a library to build new
applications.

expand on previous studies in several critical ways by exploring a range of
kilonova models and several choices of cadence, as well as by evaluating the
information content of the resulting light curves. We find that, depending on
the precise choice of cadence, the WFD survey will achieve an average kilonova
detection efficiency of $\approx 1.6-2.5\%$ and detect only $\approx 3-6$
kilonovae per year. The detected kilonovae will be within the detection volume
of Advanced LIGO/Virgo (ALV). By refitting the best resulting LSST light curves
with the same model used to generate them we find the model parameters are
generally weakly constrained, and are accurate to at best a factor of $2-3$.
Motivated by the finding that the WFD will yield a small number of kilonova
detections, with poor light curves and marginal information content, and that
the detections are in any case inside the ALV volume, we argue that
target-of-opportunity follow-up of gravitational wave triggers is a much more
effective approach for kilonova studies. We outline the qualitative foundation
for such a program with the goal of minimizing the impact on LSST operations.
We argue that observations in the $gz$-bands with a total time investment per
event of $\approx 1.5$ hour per 10 deg$^2$ of search area is sufficient to
rapidly detect and identify kilonovae with $\gtrsim 90\%$ efficiency. For an
estimated event rate of $\sim20$ per year visible to LSST, this accounts for
$\sim1.5\%$ of the total survey time. In this regime, LSST has the potential to
be a powerful tool for kilonovae discovery, with detected events handed off to

remains confined to the inner parts of the halo and was likely formed or

these stars belonged to the massive building block(s) of the proto-Milky Way

transits with ingress that is more rapid than egress, as expected for cometary
bodies with a significant tail. The algorithm is automated, so can be applied
to large samples and only a relatively small number of events need to be
manually vetted. We applied this algorithm to all long cadence light curves
from the Kepler mission, finding 16 candidate transits with significant
asymmetry, 11 of which were found to be artefacts or symmetric transits after
manual inspection. Of the 5 remaining events, four are the 0.1% depth events
previously identified for KIC 3542116 and 11084727. We identify HD 182952 (KIC
8027456) as a third system showing a potential comet transit. All three stars
showing these events have H-R diagram locations consistent with
$\sim$100Myr-old open cluster stars, as might be expected given that cometary
source regions deplete with age, and giving credence to the comet hypothesis.
If these events are part of the same population of events as seen for KIC
8462852, the small increase in detections at 0.1% depth compared to 10% depth
suggests that future work should consider whether the distribution is naturally
flat, or if comets with symmetric transits in this depth range remain
undiscovered. Future searches relying on asymmetry should be more successful if
they focus on larger samples and young stars, rather than digging further into
the noise.

coarse-grained level by a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) renormalization group (RG)
flow. On phenomenological grounds, we identify the scaling variables as the
density of thermal regions and the lengthscale that controls the decay of
typical matrix elements. Within this KT picture, the MBL phase is a line of
fixed points that terminates at the delocalization transition. We discuss two
possible scenarios distinguished by the distribution of rare, fractal thermal
inclusions within the MBL phase. In the first scenario, these regions have a
stretched exponential distribution in the MBL phase. In the second scenario,
the near-critical MBL phase hosts rare thermal regions that are power-law
distributed in size. This points to the existence of a second transition within
the MBL phase, at which these power-laws change to the stretched exponential
form expected at strong disorder. We numerically simulate two different
phenomenological RGs previously proposed to describe the MBL transition. Both
RGs display a universal power-law length distribution of thermal regions at the
transition with a critical exponent $\alpha_c=2$, and continuously varying
exponents in the MBL phase consistent with the KT picture.

complicated structures throughout the region. In particular, we find that the

field may be regulating the gas flow. We also find that the bridging material
should be depleted in ~ 1000 yr. If the bridge is part of the natal filament

the bridge could be a transient structure. Finally, we show that the 1.3 mm

possible without detailed information about their donor stars. While crucial,
this turns out to be a challenge on multiple fronts. First, multi-wavelength
spectroscopy is vital. As such systems can be highly absorbed, this is often
already hard to accomplish. Secondly, even if the spectroscopic data is
available, the determination of reliable stellar parameters requires
sophisticated model atmospheres that accurately describe the outermost layers
and the wind of the donor star.
  For early-type donors, the stellar wind is radiatively driven and there is a
smooth transition between the outermost layers of the star and the wind. The
intricate non-LTE conditions in the winds of hot stars complicate the situation
even further, as proper model atmospheres need to account for a multitude of
physics to accurately provide stellar and wind parameters. The latter are
especially crucial for the so-called ""wind-fed"" HXMBs, where the captured wind
of the supergiant donor is the only source for the material accreted by the
compact object.
  In this review I will address the different approaches for treating stellar
winds in the analysis of HMXBs. Fundamentals of stellar atmosphere modeling are
discussed, also addressing the limitations of modern models and examples from
recent analysis results for particular HMXBs. Moreover, the path for the next
generation of stellar atmosphere models will be outlined, where models can be
used not only for measurements, but also to make predictions and provide a
laboratory for theoretical conclusions. Stellar atmospheres are a key tool in
understanding HMXBs, e.g. by providing insights about the accretion of stellar
winds onto the compact object, or by placing the studied systems in the correct
evolutionary context in order to identify potential gravitational wave (GW)
progenitors.

integrated low-$J$ CO observations of six galaxy populations, including a total
of 449 galaxies between $0.01 \leq z \leq 3.26$. The CO data of each population
provide an estimate of the $\alpha_{\rm CO}$-normalized mean molecular gas
fraction ($f_{\rm mol}/\alpha_{\rm CO}$). The redshift evolution of the
luminosity$-$line-width correlation thus indicates an evolution of $f_{\rm
mol}/\alpha_{\rm CO}$. We use a Bayesian-based Monte-Carlo Markov Chain sampler
to derive the posterior probability distribution functions of $f_{\rm

inclination angles and measurement errors in the likelihood function. We find
that the molecular gas fraction evolves rapidly with redshift, $f_{\rm mol}
\propto (1+z)^\beta$ with $\beta \simeq 2$, for both normal star-forming and
starburst galaxies. Furthermore, the evolution trend agrees well with that
inferred from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and the star-forming main
sequence. Finally, at $z < 0.1$ normal star-forming galaxies require a
$\sim5\times$ larger $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ than starburst galaxies to match their
molecular gas fractions, but at $z > 1$ both star-forming types exhibit
sub-Galactic $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ values and normal star-forming galaxies appear
more gas-rich than starbursts. Future applications of this method include
calibrating Tully-Fisher relations without inclination correction and inferring
the evolution of the atomic gas fraction with HI observations.

correlation, such that galaxies with lower molecular gas depletion time
(t_{dep}) have higher gas velocity dispersion ($\sigma$). Within the scatter of
our data, our observations are consistent with the prediction that depletion
time is inversely proportionate to velocity dispersion made in theories of
feedback-regulated star formation. We also show a strong, single power-law
correlation between mid-plane pressure (P) and star formation rate surface
density (Sigma_{SFR}), which extends for 6 orders of magnitude in pressure.
Disk galaxies with lower pressure are found to be roughly in agreement with
theoretical predictions. However, in galaxies with high pressure we find
P/Sigma_{SFR} values that are significantly larger than theoretical
predictions. Our observations could be explained with any of the following: (1)
the correlation of \Sigma_{SFR}-P is significantly sub-linear; (2) the momentum
injected from star formation feedback (so-called p*/m*) is not a single,
universal value; or (3) alternate sources of pressure support are important in
gas-rich disk galaxies. Finally using published survey results, we find that
our results are consistent with the cosmic evolution of t_{dep}(z) and velocity
dispersion. Our interpretation of these results is that the cosmic evolution of
t_{dep} may be regulated not just by the supply of gas, but also the internal
regulation of star formation via feedback.

Ooguri and Vafa, that relates knot invariants to counts of holomorphic curves
with boundary on $L_{K}$, the conormal Lagrangian of the knot in the resolved

show that the quiver encodes a 3d ${\mathcal N}=2$ theory $T[Q_{K}]$ whose low

blind chess (RBC), a recently-introduced variant of chess where each player
does not know the positions of the opponent's pieces a priori but may reveal a
subset of them through chosen, private sensing actions. In contrast to many
commonly studied imperfect information games like poker, an RBC player does not
know what the opponent knows or has chosen to learn, exponentially expanding
the size of the game's information sets (i.e., the number of possible game
states that are consistent with what a player has observed). Effective RBC
sensing and moving strategies must account for the uncertainty of both players,
an essential element of many real-world decision-making problems. Here we
evaluate RBC from a game theoretic perspective, tracking the proliferation of
information sets from the perspective of selected canonical bot players in
tournament play. We show that, even for effective sensing strategies, the game
sizes of RBC compare to those of Go while the average size of a player's
information set throughout an RBC game is much greater than that of a player in
Heads-up Limit Hold 'Em. We compare these measures of complexity among

absorption bands. We also derive the stellar kinematics and find that the
stellar motions are dominated by a high ($\sim$240km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$) velocity
dispersion in the nucleus, with stars also rotating around the center. Lastly,
we measure the absorption bands, both in the optical and in the NIR, and find a

are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the molecular axis of the
reactants. Hence, by controlling the axis distribution, it is possible to
either promote or hinder the yield of products into specific final states or
scattering angles. This idea has been successfully implemented in experiments
by polarizing the internuclear axis before the reaction takes place, either by
manipulating the rotational angular distribution or by Stark effect in the
presence of an orienting field. When there is a dominant reaction mechanism,
characterized by a set of impact parameters and angles of attack, it is
expected that a preparation that helps the system to reach the transition state
associated with that mechanism will promote the reaction, whilst a different
preparation would generally impair the reaction. However, when two or more
competing mechanisms via interference contribute to the reaction into specific
scattering angles and final states, it is not evident which would be the effect
of changing the axis preparation. To address this problem, throughout this
article we have simulated the effect that different experimental preparations
have on the DCSs for the H + D2 reaction at relatively high energies, for which
it has been shown that several competing mechanisms give rise to interference
that shapes the DCS. To this aim, we have extended the formulation of the
polarization dependent DCS to calculate polarization dependent generalized
deflection functions of ranks greater than zero. Our results show that
interference are very sensitive to changes in the internuclear axis
preparation, and that the shape of the DCS can be controlled exquisitely.

elaborated, the theory of {best constrained} constructive operator
approximation is still not so well developed. Despite increasing demands from
applications this subject is hardly tractable because of intrinsic difficulties
in associated approximation techniques. This paper concerns the best
constrained approximation of a non-linear operator in probability spaces. We
propose and justify a new approach and technique based on the following
observation. Methods for best approximation are aimed at obtaining the best
solution within a certain class; the accuracy of the solution is limited by the
extent to which the class is suitable.
  By contrast, iterative methods are normally convergent but the convergence
can be quite slow. Moreover, in practice only a finite number of iteration
loops can be carried out and therefore, the final approximate solution is often
unsatisfactorily inaccurate. A natural idea is to combine the methods for best
approximation and iterative techniques to exploit their advantageous features.
Here, we present an approach which realizes this.
  The proposed approximating operator has several degrees of freedom to
minimize the associated error. In particular, one of the specific features of
the approximating technique we develop is special random vectors called
injections. They are determined in the way that allows us to further minimize
the associated error.

state-sponsored trolls with a focus on how their strategies change over time,
the different campaigns they embark on, and differences between the trolls
operated by Russia and Iran. Among other things, we find: 1) that Russian
trolls were pro-Trump while Iranian trolls were anti-Trump; 2) evidence that
campaigns undertaken by such actors are influenced by real-world events; and 3)
that the behavior of such actors is not consistent over time, hence automated

vorticity fluctuate rapidly in magnitude and oscillate in sign. Much work
exists on the characterization of magnitude variations, but far less on sign
oscillations. While averages performed on large scales tend to zero because of
the oscillatory character, those performed on increasingly smaller scales will
vary with the averaging scale in some characteristic way. This characteristic
variation at high Reynolds numbers is captured by the so-called cancellation
exponent, which measures how local averages tend to cancel out as the averaging
scale increases, in space or time. Past experimental work suggests that the
exponents in turbulence depend on whether one considers quantities in full
three-dimensional space or uses their one- or two-dimensional cuts. We compute
cancellation exponents of vorticity and longitudinal as well as transverse
velocity gradients in isotropic turbulence at Taylor-scale Reynolds number up
to 1300 on $8192^3$ grids. The 2D cuts yield the same exponents as those for
full 3D, while the 1D cuts yield smaller numbers, suggesting that the results
in higher dimensions are more reliable. We make the case that the presence of
vortical filaments in isotropic turbulence leads to this conclusion. This
effect is particularly conspicuous in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, where an
increased degree of spatial coherence develops along the imposed magnetic
field.

unavailability of communication feature. Within such a situation, the ultimate
deal for a UAV operator is to provide a cost effective service with acceptable
availability. This would allow to meet some target Quality of Service while

H band) spectropolarimetry mode of the Wide-field InfraRed Camera (WIRC) on the
200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory. The instrument utilizes a novel
polarimeter design based on a quarter-wave plate and a polarization grating
(PG), which provides full linear polarization measurements (Stokes I, Q, and U)
in one exposure. The PG also has high transmission across the J and H bands.
The instrument is situated at the prime focus of an equatorially mounted
telescope. As a result, the system only has one reflection in the light path,
providing minimal telescope induced polarization. A data reduction pipeline has
been developed for WIRC+Pol to produce linear polarization measurements from
observations. WIRC+Pol has been on-sky since February 2017. Results from the
first year commissioning data show that the instrument has a high dispersion
efficiency as expected from the polarization grating. We demonstrate the
polarimetric stability of the instrument with RMS variation at 0.2% level over
30 minutes for a bright standard star (J = 8.7). While the spectral extraction
is photon noise limited, polarization calibration between sources remain
limited by systematics, likely related to gravity dependent pointing effects.
We discuss instrumental systematics we have uncovered in the data, their
potential causes, along with calibrations that are necessary to eliminate them.
We describe a modulator upgrade that will eliminate the slowly varying
systematics and provide polarimetric accuracy better than 0.1%.

anionic binding energies (BEs) are found to be 3.09 eV, 2.98 eV, 3.03 eV, 3.06

anionic BEs for several of these atoms compare well with the existing
theoretical electron affinities including those calculated using the

$\sigma_{\ast}$ within sub-arcsecond apertures for 28 nearby galaxies. Our data
consist of Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) long-slit spectra
obtained with the G750M grating centred on the H$\alpha$ spectral range. We fit
the spectra using a library of single stellar population models and Gaussian
emission lines, while constraining in most cases the stellar-population content
from an initial fit to G430L STIS spectra. We illustrate how these
$\sigma_{\ast}$ measurements can be useful for constraining the mass
$M_{\bullet}$ of supermassive black holes (SBHs) by concentrating on the cases
of the lenticular galaxies NGC4435 and NGC4459. These are characterized by
similar ground-based half-light radii stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm
e}$ values but remarkably different $M_{\bullet}$ as obtained from modelling
their central ionised-gas kinematics, where NGC4435 appears to host a
significantly undermassive SBH compared to what is expected from the
$M_{\bullet}-\sigma_{\rm e}$ relation. For both galaxies, we build Jeans
axisymmetric dynamical models to match the ground-based stellar kinematics
obtained with SAURON integral-field spectrograph, including a SBH with
$M_{\bullet}$ value as predicted by the $M_{\bullet}-\sigma_{\rm e}$ relation
and using high-resolution HST images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys
to construct the stellar-mass model. By mimicking the HST observing conditions
we use such reference models to make a prediction for the nuclear
$\sigma_{\ast}$ value. Whereas this was found to agree with our nuclear
$\sigma_{\ast}$ measurement for NGC4459, for NGC4435 the observed
$\sigma_{\ast}$ is remarkably smaller than the predicted one, which further
suggests that this galaxy could host an undermassive SBH.

  Envelope Interactions","Accepted to MNRAS. 10 pages, 7 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stz601",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A widely used method for parameterizing the outcomes of common envelopes
(CEs) involves defining an ejection efficiency, $\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$,
that represents the fraction of orbital energy used to unbind the envelope as
the orbit decays. Given $\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$, a prediction for the
post-CE orbital separation is possible with knowledge of the energy required to
unbind the primary's envelope from its core. Unfortunately, placing
observational constraints on $\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is challenging as it
requires knowledge of the primary's structure at the onset of the common
envelope phase. Numerical simulations have also had difficulties reproducing
post-CE orbital configurations as they leave extended, but still bound,
envelopes. Using detailed stellar interior profiles, we calculate
$\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values for a matrix of primary-companion mass
pairs when the primary is at maximal extent in its evolution. We find that the
ejection efficiency is most sensitive to the properties of the surface-contact
convective region (SCCR). In this region, the convective transport timescales
are often short compared to orbital decay timescales, thereby allowing the star
to effectively radiate orbital energy and thus lower
$\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$. The inclusion of convection in numerical
simulations of CEs may aid ejection without the need for additional energy
sources as the orbit must shrink substantially further before the requisite
energy can be tapped to drive ejection. Additionally, convection leads to
predicted post-CE orbital periods of less than a day in many cases, an
observational result that has been difficult to reproduce in population studies
where $\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is taken to be constant. Finally, we
provide a simple method to calculate $\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ if the
properties of the SCCR are known.

casual models. The topic of causal explanation in artificial intelligence has
gathered interest in recent years as researchers and practitioners aim to
increase trust and understanding of intelligent decision-making. While
different sub-fields of artificial intelligence have looked into this problem
with a sub-field-specific view, there are few models that aim to capture
explanation more generally. One general model is based on structural causal
models. It defines an explanation as a fact that, if found to be true, would
constitute an actual cause of a specific event. However, research in philosophy
and social sciences shows that explanations are contrastive: that is, when
people ask for an explanation of an event -- the fact -- they (sometimes
implicitly) are asking for an explanation relative to some contrast case; that
is, ""Why P rather than Q?"". In this paper, we extend the structural causal
model approach to define two complementary notions of contrastive explanation,
and demonstrate them on two classical problems in artificial intelligence:
classification and planning. We believe that this model can help researchers in
subfields of artificial intelligence to better understand contrastive
explanation.

quintessence cosmological parameters to the logarithmic and exponential dark
energy potentials. The previous paper (Thompson 2018) demonstrated the
formalism using power and inverse power potentials. The essentially identical
evolution of the Hubble parameter for all of the quintessence cases and
LambdaCDM is attributed to the flatness of the quintessence dark energy
potentials in the dark energy dominated era. The Hubble parameter is therefore
incapable of discriminating between static and dynamic dark energy. Unlike the
other three potentials considered in the two papers the logarithmic dark energy
potential requires a numerical integration in the formula for the
superpotential rather than being an analytic function. The dark energy equation
of state and the fundamental constants continue to be good discriminators
between static and dynamical dark energy. A new analysis of quintessence with
all four of the potentials relative the swampland conjectures indicates that
the conjecture on the change in the scalar field is satisfied but that the
conjecture on the change of the potential is not.

However, current supervised dimensionality reduction approaches are difficult
to scale for situations characterized by large datasets given the high
computational complexities associated with such methods. While stochastic
approximation strategies have been explored for unsupervised dimensionality
reduction to tackle this challenge, such approaches are not well-suited for
accelerating computational speed for supervised dimensionality reduction.
Motivated to tackle this challenge, in this study we explore a novel direction
of directly learning optimal class-aware embeddings in a supervised manner via
the notion of supervised random projections (SRP). The key idea behind SRP is
that, rather than performing spectral decomposition (or approximations thereof)
which are computationally prohibitive for large-scale data, we instead perform
a direct decomposition by leveraging kernel approximation theory and the
symmetry of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) measure of
dependence between the embedded data and the labels. Experimental results on
five different synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SRP strategy for class-aware embedding learning can be very promising in
producing embeddings that are highly competitive with existing supervised
dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., SPCA and KSPCA) while achieving 1-2
orders of magnitude better computational performance. As such, such an
efficient approach to learning embeddings for dimensionality reduction can be a
powerful tool for large-scale data analysis and visualization.

  with Complex Operations",,,,,"cs.FL cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The design and implementation of decision procedures for checking path
feasibility in string-manipulating programs is an important problem, whose
applications include symbolic execution and automated detection of cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. A (symbolic) path is a finite sequence of
assignments and assertions (i.e. without loops), and checking its feasibility
amounts to determining the existence of inputs that yield a successful
execution.
  We give two general semantic conditions which together ensure the
decidability of path feasibility: (1) each assertion admits regular monadic
decomposition, and (2) each assignment uses a (possibly nondeterministic)
function whose inverse relation preserves regularity. We show these conditions
are expressive since they are satisfied by a multitude of string operations.
They also strictly subsume existing decidable string theories, and most
existing benchmarks (e.g. most of Kaluza's, and all of SLOG's, Stranger's, and
SLOTH's). We give a simple decision procedure and an extensible architecture of
a string solver in that a user may easily incorporate his/her own string
functions. We show the general fragment has a tight, but high complexity. To
address this, we propose to allow only partial string functions (i.e., prohibit
nondeterminism) in condition (2). When nondeterministic functions are needed,
we also provide a syntactic fragment that provides a support of
nondeterministic functions but can be reduced to an existing solver SLOTH.
  We provide an efficient implementation of our decision procedure for
deterministic partial string functions in a new string solver OSTRICH. It
provides built-in support for concatenation, reverse, functional transducers,
and replaceall and provides a framework for extensibility to support further
string functions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our new solver against other

computationally light method for inferring the magnetic field strength and its
orientation in the Sun's atmosphere. In this work we study the validity and
limitations of this tool when applied to full Stokes Ca II 8542 A profiles to
extract information about the chromospheric magnetic field. We find that the
range of validity of the WFA depends, amongst other things, on the component of
the magnetic field that one is trying to infer. The retrieval of line-of-sight
component of the chromospheric magnetic field from the core of the spectral
line is reliable for field strengths up to ~1200 G, even when moderate velocity
gradients are present. The horizontal component, on the other hand, is suitably
derived using the wing-core boundary of the spectral line, but typically yields
systematic errors of >10%. The effects of scattering polarization further
compound the problem by rendering the transverse field inference problematic in
quiet Sun areas, and for observing geometries within 30 degrees of the limb.
Magneto-optical effects disproportionately challenge the determination of the
magnetic field azimuth in the transverse plane, leading to errors of ~10
degrees. Typical noise levels of 10d-3 relative to the continuum intensity
preclude the accurate retrieval of the transverse field strength and its
azimuth below a threshold of a few hundred gauss. Striving for a noise level of
10d-4 significantly improves the diagnostic capability of the WFA with this
spectral line, at which point the magnetic field inference becomes limited by
systematic errors.

The later are characterized by local Chern numbers, that makes them
two-dimensional analogs of Weyl semimetals. We find that the formation of the
Weyl nodes is accompanied by an emergence of one-dimensional surface states,
similar to Fermi arcs in Weyl semimetals and edge states in two-dimensional
graphene. We explore these states for a quasi-one-dimensional non-symmorphic
ribbon. The type and strength of applied deformation control the location and
Weyl nodes and their composition. This determines the properties of emerging

partial quantum power, such as preparing or measuring quantum states in the
classical basis, which simplifies the implementations of quantum cryptography.
However, the efficiency of the existing semiquantum cryptographic protocols was
relatively low from a practical point of view. In this paper, we devise some
new semiquantum key distribution (SQKD) protocols which highly improve the
efficiency of the most well-known SQKD protocols [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 140501

asymptotically close to 100%. Besides, one of our proposed protocols also
utilizes the discarded X-SIFT bits in the original SQKD protocol, which further
improves the efficiency of SQKD. We prove that the proposed SQKD protocols are
completely robust against the most general attack.

distances, with applications ranging from protein structure determination to
global positioning and manifold learning. They are, however, static objects
which serve to localize points from a snapshot of distances. If the objects
move, one expects to do better by modeling the motion. In this paper, we
introduce Kinetic Euclidean Distance Matrices (KEDMs)---a new kind of
time-dependent distance matrices that incorporate motion. The entries of KEDMs
become functions of time, the squared time-varying distances. We study two
smooth trajectory models---polynomial and bandlimited trajectories---and show
that these trajectories can be reconstructed from incomplete, noisy distance
observations, scattered over multiple time instants. Our main contribution is a
semidefinite relaxation (SDR), inspired by SDRs for static EDMs. Similarly to
the static case, the SDR is followed by a spectral factorization step; however,
because spectral factorization of polynomial matrices is more challenging than
for constant matrices, we propose a new factorization method that uses anchor
measurements. Extensive numerical experiments show that KEDMs and the new
semidefinite relaxation accurately reconstruct trajectories from noisy,
incomplete distance data and that, in fact, motion improves rather than
degrades localization if properly modeled. This makes KEDMs a promising tool
for problems in geometry of dynamic points sets.

particularly relevant to scenarios of real-time data monitoring and reporting,

whose distribution is light-tailed, meaning that the tail approaches zero at
least as fast as the exponential distribution. For such data streams,
individual observations are expected to be concentrated below an unknown
threshold. Estimating this threshold from the data can potentially violate
privacy as it would reveal particular events tied to individuals [1]. On the
other hand an overly conservative threshold may impact accuracy by adding more
noise than necessary. We construct a utility optimizing differentially private
mechanism to release this threshold based on the input stream. Our main
advantage over the state-of-the-art algorithms is that the resulting noise
added to each observation of the stream is scaled to the threshold instead of a
possibly much larger bound; resulting in considerable gain in utility when the
difference is significant. Using two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that
our mechanism, on average, improves the utility by a factor of 3.5 on the first

employ both acoustic similarity cues and contextual cues to decode information
and we focus on a model that incorporates both sources of information. The
representational ambiguity of acoustics, which manifests itself in word
confusions, is often resolved by both humans and machines through contextual
cues. A range of representational ambiguities can emerge in various domains
further to acoustic perception, such as morphological transformations,
paraphrasing for NLP tasks like machine translation etc. In this work, we
present a case study in application to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
where the word confusions are related to acoustic similarity. We present
several techniques to train an acoustic perceptual similarity representation
ambiguity. We term this Confusion2Vec and learn on unsupervised-generated data
from ASR confusion networks or lattice-like structures. Appropriate evaluations
for the Confusion2Vec are formulated for gauging acoustic similarity in
addition to semantic-syntactic and word similarity evaluations. The
Confusion2Vec is able to model word confusions efficiently, without
compromising on the semantic-syntactic word relations, thus effectively
enriching the word vector space with extra task relevant ambiguity information.
We provide an intuitive exploration of the 2-dimensional Confusion2Vec space
using Principal Component Analysis of the embedding and relate to semantic,

utilization of uncertainty present in lattices is demonstrated through small

short-period exoplanets with a paucity in their occurrence, a radius `valley',
around $1.5-2.0$ $R_\oplus$. In this work, we investigate the effect of a
planet's own cooling luminosity on its thermal evolution and atmospheric
mass-loss (core-powered mass-loss) and determine its observational consequences
for the radius distribution of small, close-in exoplanets. Using simple
analytical descriptions and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
planetary evolution based on the core-powered mass-loss mechanism alone (i.e.,
without any photoevaporation) can produce the observed valley in the radius
distribution. Our results match the valley's location, shape and slope in
planet radius-orbital period parameter space, and the relative magnitudes of
the planet occurrence rate above and below the valley. We find that the slope
of the valley is, to first order, dictated by the atmospheric mass-loss
timescale at the Bondi radius and given by $\text{d log} R_p/ \text{d log} P
\simeq 1/(3(1-\beta))$ which evaluates to $ -0.11$ for $ \beta \simeq 4$, where
$M_c/M_\oplus = (R_c/R_{\oplus})^{\beta} (\rho_{c*}/\rho_{\oplus})^{\beta/3}$
is the mass-radius relation of the core. This choice for $\beta$ yields good
agreement with observations and attests to the significance of internal
compression for massive planetary cores. We further find that the location of
the valley scales as $\rho_{c*}^{-4/9}$ and that the observed planet population
must have predominantly rocky cores with typical water-ice fractions of less
than $\sim 20\%$. Furthermore, we show that the relative magnitude of the
planet occurrence rate above and below the valley is sensitive to the details
of the planet-mass distribution but that the location of the valley is not.

candidate to realize a sensitive magnetic field sensor. In particular, since
the axes of the NV centers are distributed along four directions, a collection
of measurement data from NV centers with different axes provides information on
the vector components of a magnetic field. However, in the conventional
approach, the low measurement contrast of NV centers limits the sensitivity of
vector magnetic field sensing. Recently, to overcome this problem,
multi-frequency control of the NV centers has been proposed. The key idea is
that the four types of NV centers with different axes are simultaneously
controlled by multi-frequency microwave pulses. Here, we demonstrate vector
magnetic field sensing with an ensemble of NV centers in diamond via such
multi-frequency control with pulsed-type measurements. We use Hahn echo pulses
and extract information on the vector components of an applied AC magnetic
field. We find that the sensitivity of diamond-based vector field sensing with
multi-frequency control is better than that with single-frequency control for
every vector component of a magnetic field.

we introduce a novel architecture which we call Robust Conditional GAN (RCGAN).
The main idea is to corrupt the label of the generated sample before feeding to
the adversarial discriminator, forcing the generator to produce samples with
clean labels. This approach of passing through a matching noisy channel is
justified by corresponding multiplicative approximation bounds between the loss
of the RCGAN and the distance between the clean real distribution and the
generator distribution. This shows that the proposed approach is robust, when
used with a carefully chosen discriminator architecture, known as projection
discriminator. When the distribution of the noise is not known, we provide an
extension of our architecture, which we call RCGAN-U, that learns the noise
model simultaneously while training the generator. We show experimentally on
MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets that both the approaches consistently improve upon
baseline approaches, and RCGAN-U closely matches the performance of RCGAN.

follow exponentially decreasing distributions of $M_\text{s}$. More shocks
appear for larger $\mathcal{M}_\text{turb}$ and larger $\beta_0$. Fast shock
populations dominate over slow shocks if $\beta_0\gg1$, but substantial
populations of slow shocks develop in the cases of $\beta\lesssim1$, i.e.,
strong background fields. The shock dissipation of turbulent energy occurs
preferentially at fast shocks with $M_\text{s}\lesssim$ a few to several, and
the dissipation at strong shocks shows exponentially decreasing functions of

eliminates the influence of moving objects in dynamic environments is proposed.
This method utilizes the correlation between map points to separate points that
are part of the static scene and points that are part of different moving
objects into different groups. A sparse graph is first created using Delaunay
triangulation from all map points. In this graph, the vertices represent map
points, and each edge represents the correlation between adjacent points. If
the relative position between two points remains consistent over time, there is
correlation between them, and they are considered to be moving together
rigidly. If not, they are considered to have no correlation and to be in
separate groups. After the edges between the uncorrelated points are removed
during point-correlation optimization, the remaining graph separates the map
points of the moving objects from the map points of the static scene. The
largest group is assumed to be the group of reliable static map points.
Finally, motion estimation is performed using only these points. The proposed
method was implemented for RGB-D sensors, evaluated with a public RGB-D
benchmark, and tested in several additional challenging environments. The
experimental results demonstrate that robust and accurate performance can be
achieved by the proposed SLAM method in both slightly and highly dynamic

late-phase flux emergence taken by IRIS, Hinode and SDO. The loop system
consists of many transition region loop threads with size of 5--12\arcsec\ in
length and $\sim0.5$\arcsec in width and coronal loops with similar length and
$\sim2$\arcsec width. Although the loop system consists of threads with
different temperatures, most individual loop thread have temperature in a
narrow range. In the middle of the loop system, it shows clear systematic
blue-shifts of about 10\,\kms\ in the transition region that is consistent with
a flux emerging picture, while red-shifts of about 10\,\kms\ in the corona is
observed. The nonthermal velocity of the loop system are smaller than the
surrounding region in the transition region but are comparable in the corona.
The electron densities of the coronal counterpart of the loop system range from
$1\times10^9$\,cm$^{-3}$ to $4\times10^9$\,cm$^{-3}$. Electron density of a
transition region loop is also measured and found to be about
$5\times10^{10}$\,cm$^{-3}$, a magnitude larger than that in the coronal loops.
In agreement with imaging data, the temperature profiles derived from the
differential emission measurement technique confirms that some of the loops
have been heated to corona. Our observations indicate that the flux emergence
in its late phase is much different from that at the early stage. While the
observed transition region is dominated by emerging flux, these emerging loops
could be heated to corona and the heatings (if via nonthermal processes) most
likely take place only after they reaching the transition region or lower
corona.

assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network over Nakagami-$m$ fading
channels. Two slots are utilized to transmit signals from the base station to
destination. At the first slot, the base station broadcasts the superposition
signal of the two users to all decode-and-forward relays by message mapping
strategy. Then the selected relay transmits superposition signal to the two
users via power-domain NOMA technology. Three relay selection (RS) schemes,
i.e., optimal single relay selection (OSRS) scheme, two-step single relay
selection (TSRS) scheme, and optimal dual relay selection (ODRS) scheme, are
proposed and the secrecy outage performance are analyzed. As a benchmark, we
also examine the secrecy outage performance of the NOMA systems with
traditional multiple relays combining (TMRC) scheme in which all the relay that
successfully decode signals from the source forward signals to the NOMA users
with equal power. Considering the correlation between the secrecy capacity of
two users and different secrecy requirement for two NOMA users, the closed-form
expressions for the security outage probability (SOP) of the proposed OSRS,
TSRS, and ODRS schemes along with the TMRC scheme are derived and validated via
simulations. To get more insights, we also derive the closed-form expressions
for the asymptotic SOP for all the schemes with fixed and dynamic power
allocations. Furthermore, the secrecy diversity order (SDO) of cooperative NOMA
systems is obtained. The results demonstrate that our proposed schemes can
significantly enhance the secrecy performance compared to the TMRC scheme and
that all the RS schemes with fixed power allocation obtain zero SDO and the
OSRS scheme with dynamic power allocation obtains the same SDO as TMRC.

currently drawing a lot of attention. Sharing health data is considered to be a
critical approach to improve the quality of healthcare service and reduce
medical costs. However, EMRs are fragmented across decentralized hospitals,
which hinders data sharing and puts patients' privacy at risks. To address
these issues, we propose a blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for
EMRs, called BPDS. In BPDS, the original EMRs are stored securely in the cloud
and the indexes are reserved in a tamper-proof consortium blockchain. By this
means, the risk of the medical data leakage could be greatly reduced, and at
the same time, the indexes in blockchain ensure that the EMRs can not be
modified arbitrarily. Secure data sharing can be accomplished automatically
according to the predefined access permissions of patients through the smart
contracts of blockchain. Besides, the joint-design of the CP-ABE-based access
control mechanism and the content extraction signature scheme provides strong
privacy preservation in data sharing. Security analysis shows that BPDS is a
secure and effective way to realize data sharing for EMRs.

unweighted graphs: A graph $G(V, E)$ along with a parameter $p \in (0, 1)$ is
given in the input. Each edge of $G$ is realized independently with probability
$p$. The goal is to select a degree bounded (dependent only on $p$) subgraph
$H$ of $G$ such that the expected size/weight of maximum realized matching of
$H$ is close to that of $G$.
  This model of stochastic matching has attracted significant attention over
the recent years due to its various applications. The most fundamental open
question is the best approximation factor achievable for such algorithms that,
in the literature, are referred to as non-adaptive algorithms. Prior work has
identified breaking (near) half-approximation as a barrier for both weighted
and unweighted graphs. Our main results are as follows:
  -- We analyze a simple and clean algorithm and show that for unweighted
graphs, it finds an (almost) $4\sqrt{2}-5$ ($\approx 0.6568$) approximation by
querying $O(\frac{\log (1/p)}{p})$ edges per vertex. This improves over the
state-of-the-art $0.5001$ approximate algorithm of Assadi et al. [EC'17].
  -- We show that the same algorithm achieves a $0.501$ approximation for
weighted graphs by querying $O(\frac{\log (1/p)}{p})$ edges per vertex. This is
the first algorithm to break $0.5$ approximation barrier for weighted graphs.
It also improves the per-vertex queries of the state-of-the-art by Yamaguchi
and Maehara [SODA'18] and Behnezhad and Reyhani [EC'18].
  Our algorithms are fundamentally different from prior works, yet are very
simple and natural. For the analysis, we introduce a number of procedures that

l2-norm based regularizations in one Huber-type loss function, and then
formulate an optimization problem in the Fourier Domain for fast computation,
which enables the tracker to adaptively ignore the noisy features produced from
occlusion and illumination variation, while keep the advantages of l2-norm
based regression. This is achieved due to the attribute of Convolution Theorem
that the correlation in spatial domain corresponds to an element-wise product
in the Fourier domain, resulting in that the l1-norm optimization problem could
be decomposed into multiple sub-optimization spaces in the Fourier domain. But
the optimized variables in the Fourier domain are complex, which makes using
the l1-norm impossible if the real and imaginary parts of the variables cannot
be separated. However, our proposed optimization problem is formulated in such
a way that their real part and imaginary parts are indeed well separated. As
such, the proposed optimization problem can be solved efficiently to obtain
their optimal values independently with closed-form solutions. Extensive
experiments on two large benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed
tracking algorithm significantly improves the tracking accuracy of the original
kernelized correlation filter (KCF) while with little sacrifice on tracking
speed. Moreover, it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

address all three aspects simultaneously in PSNs. In this paper, we construct
an efficient privacy-preserving incentive scheme without trusted third party

idea of ""concept processing"", meaning that instead of processing words, such
systems process semantic concepts which carry meaning and share contexts with
other concepts. Ontology is commonly used as a structure that captures the
knowledge about a certain area via providing concepts and relations between
them. Traditionally, concept hierarchies have been built manually by knowledge
engineers or domain experts. However, the manual construction of a concept
hierarchy suffers from several limitations such as its coverage and the
enormous costs of its extension and maintenance. Ontology learning, usually
referred to the (semi-)automatic support in ontology development, is usually
divided into steps, going from concepts identification, passing through
hierarchy and non-hierarchy relations detection and, seldom, axiom extraction.
It is reasonable to say that among these steps the current frontier is in the
establishment of concept hierarchies, since this is the backbone of ontologies
and, therefore, a good concept hierarchy is already a valuable resource for
many ontology applications. The automatic construction of concept hierarchies
from texts is a complex task and much work have been proposing approaches to
better extract relations between concepts. These different proposals have never
been contrasted against each other on the same set of data and across different
languages. Such comparison is important to see whether they are complementary
or incremental. Also, we can see whether they present different tendencies
towards recall and precision. This paper evaluates these different methods on
the basis of hierarchy metrics such as density and depth, and evaluation
metrics such as Recall and Precision. Results shed light over the comprehensive

auxiliary datapoints by the semantic embeddings of unseen classes alleviates
the above problem. Current approaches combine the auxiliary datapoints and
original training data to train the generalized zero-shot learning model and

stage of the ICL formation, but the bulk of the mass/metals contents are given

the automatic speaker verification (ASV) task. This simple average pooling,
however, is inherently sensitive to the phonetic content of the utterance. An
interesting idea borrowed from machine translation is the attention-based
mechanism, where the contribution of an input word to the translation at a
particular time is weighted by an attention score. This score reflects the
relevance of the input word and the present translation. We can use the same
idea to align utterances with different phonetic contents. This paper proposes
a phonetic-attention scoring approach for d-vector systems. By this approach,
an attention score is computed for each frame pair. This score reflects the
similarity of the two frames in phonetic content, and is used to weigh the
contribution of this frame pair in the utterance-based scoring. This new
scoring approach emphasizes the frame pairs with similar phonetic contents,
which essentially provides a soft alignment for utterances with any phonetic
contents. Experimental results show that compared with the naive average
pooling, this phonetic-attention scoring approach can deliver consistent
performance improvement in ASV tasks of both text-dependent and

experiments are investigated by NLO and NNLO perturbative QCD. We present the
calculated angular parameters $\lambda$, $\mu$, $\nu$ and the degree of
violation of the Lam-Tung relation, $1-\lambda-2\nu$, for the NA10, E615 and
E866 experiments. Predictions for the ongoing COMPASS and SeaQuest experiments
are also presented. The transverse momentum ($q_T$) distributions of $\lambda$
and $\nu$ show a clear dependence on the dimuon mass ($Q$) while those of $\mu$
have a strong rapidity ($x_F$) dependence. Furthermore, $\lambda$ and $\nu$ are
found to scale with $q_T/Q$. These salient features could be qualitatively
understood by a geometric approach where the lepton angular distribution
parameters are expressed in terms of the polar and azimuthal angles of the
""natural axis"" in the dilepton rest frame.

However, two potential problems of these neural models deserve more
investigation. Firstly, both models suffer from `information leak', which means
that some parameters participating in model training will be discarded during

`unconstrained distribution' may degrade the performance of the subsequent

training approach that (1) discards the parametric classifier, and (2) enforces
the distribution of the derived speaker vectors to be Gaussian. Our experiments
on the VoxCeleb and SITW databases demonstrated that this new training approach
produced more representative and regular speaker embeddings, leading to

quantum Rabi model (QRM), which describes a two-level or spin-half system
coupled with a single bosonic mode by a two-photon process. In the polaron
picture, the coupling in the two-photon process leads to spin-related asymmetry
so that the original single bosonic mode splits into two separated frequency
modes for the opposite spins, which correspond to two \textit{bare} polarons.
Furthermore, the tunneling causes these two bare polarons to exchange their
components with each other, thus leading to additional \textit{induced}
polarons. According to this picture, the variational ground-state wave function
of the two-photon QRM can be correctly constructed, with the ground-state
energy and other physical observables in good agreement with the exact numerics
in all the coupling regimes. Furthermore, generalization to multiple induced
polarons involving higher orders in the tunneling effect provides a systematic
way to yield a rapid convergence in accuracy even around the difficult spectral
collapse point. In addition, the polaron picture provides a distinctive
understanding of the spectral collapse behavior, that is about the existence of
discrete energy levels apart from the collapsed spectrum at the spectral
collapse point. This work illustrates that the polaron picture is helpful to
capture the key physics in this nonlinear light-matter interaction model and
indicates that this method can be applicable to more complicated QRM-related
models.

knowledge the first solution for efficient computation of CICs in
permissionless blockchains with guarantees for a threat model with both
Byzantine and selfish nodes. YODA selects one or more execution sets (ES) via
Sortition to execute a particular CIC off-chain. One key innovation is the
MultI-Round Adaptive Consensus using Likelihood Estimation (MIRACLE) algorithm
based on sequential hypothesis testing. M I RACLE allows the execution sets to
be small thus making YODA efficient while ensuring correct CIC execution with
high probability. It adapts the number of ES sets automatically depending on
the concentration of Byzantine nodes in the system and is optimal in terms of
the expected number of ES sets used in certain scenarios. Through a suite of
economic incentives and technical mechanisms such as the novel Randomness
Inserted Contract Execution (RICE) algorithm, we force selfish nodes to behave
honestly. We also prove that the honest behavior of selfish nodes is an
approximate Nash Equilibrium. We present the system design and details of YODA

implementation built on top of Ethereum demonstrates the ability of YODA to run
CICs with orders of magnitude higher gas per unit time as well as total gas

less constraints on the loss function, such as sub-gaussian or bounded. We
further provide several upper bounds on the algorithmic transport cost in terms
of total variation distance, relative entropy (or KL-divergence), and VC

theory with statistical learning theory. Moreover, we also study different
conditions for loss functions under which the generalization error of a
learning algorithm can be upper bounded by different probability metrics
between distributions relating to the output hypothesis and/or the input data.
Finally, under our established framework, we analyze the generalization in deep

communities. When wildfires become uncontrollable, Incident Manager Teams
(IMT's) dispatch response vehicles to key assets to undertake protective tasks
and so mitigate the risk to these assets. In developing a deployment plan under
severe time pressure, IMT's need to consider the special requirements of each
asset, the resources (vehicles and their teams), as well as uncertainties
associated with the wildfire. A common situation that arises in southern
Australian wildfires is a wind change. There is a reliable forecast of a wind
change, but some uncertainty around the timing of that change. To assist IMT's
to deal with this situation we develop a two-stage stochastic model to
integrate such an uncertainty with the complexities of asset protection
operations. This is the first time a mathematical model is proposed which
considers uncertainty in the timing of a scenario change. The model is
implemented for a case study that uses the context of the 2009 Black Saturday
bushfires in Victoria. A new set of benchmark instances is generated using
realistic wildfire attributes to test the computational tractability of our
model and the results compared to a dynamic rerouting approach. The
computations reveal that, compared with dynamic rerouting, the new model can
generate better deployment plans. The model can achieve solutions in
operational time for realistic-sized problems, although for larger problems the
sub-optimal rerouting algorithm would still need to be deployed.

  We formalize this as a hypothesis about the form that pregroup models of
natural languages must take, and demonstrate by an artificial language example
that these restrictions are not imposed by the pregroup axioms themselves. We
compare and contrast the artificial language examples with natural languages
(using Welsh, a language where the 'noun' type cannot be taken as primitive, as
an illustrative example).
  The hypothesis is simply that there must exist a causal connection, or
information flow, between the words of a sentence in a language whose purpose
is to communicate information. This is not necessarily the case with formal
languages that are simply generated by a series of 'meaning-free' rules. This

vector spaces and we use Frobenius algebras to allow for copying. In the second

In radio networks, however, obtaining this information can be difficult due to
ad hoc deployments and communication that occurs on a collision-prone shared
channel. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of the approximate neighbor
counting problem, which requires nodes to obtain a constant factor
approximation of the size of their network neighborhood. We produce new lower
and upper bounds for three main variations of this problem in the radio network
model: (a) the network is single-hop and every node must obtain an estimate of
its neighborhood size; (b) the network is multi-hop and only a designated node
must obtain an estimate of its neighborhood size; and (c) the network is
multi-hop and every node must obtain an estimate of its neighborhood size. In
studying these problem variations, we consider solutions with and without
collision detection, and with both constant and high success probability. Some
of our results are extensions of existing strategies, while others require
technical innovations. We argue this collection of results provides insight
into the nature of this well-motivated problem (including how it differs from
related symmetry breaking tasks in radio networks), and provides a useful
toolbox for algorithm designers tackling higher level problems that might
benefit from neighborhood size estimates.

noise aware shadow-up function and Retinex (retina and cortex) decomposition.
Under low light conditions, images taken by digital cameras have low contrast
in dark or bright regions. This is due to a limited dynamic range that imaging
sensors have. For this reason, various contrast enhancement methods have been
proposed. Our proposed method can enhance the contrast of images without not
only over-enhancement but also noise amplification. In the proposed method, an
image is decomposed into illumination layer and reflectance layer based on the
retinex theory, and lightness information of the illumination layer is
adjusted. A shadow-up function is used for preventing over-enhancement. The
proposed mapping function, designed by using a noise aware histogram, allows
not only to enhance contrast of dark region, but also to avoid amplifying
noise, even under strong noise environments.

case where the number of served users is not larger than the number of transmit
antennas at the base station (BS), we mathematically derive the optimal
precoding structure based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. By
formulating the dual problem, the precoding problem for multi-level modulations
is transformed into a pre-scaling operation using quadratic programming (QP)
optimization. We further consider the case where the number of served users is
larger than the number of transmit antennas at the BS. By employing the pseudo
inverse, we show that the optimal solution of the pre-scaling vector is
equivalent to a linear combination of the right singular vectors corresponding
to zero singular values, and derive the equivalent QP formulation. We also
present the condition under which multiplexing more streams than the number of
transmit antennas is achievable. For both considered scenarios, we propose a
modified iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal precoding matrix, as well as
a sub-optimal closed-form precoder. Numerical results validate our derivations
on the optimal precoding structures for multi-level modulations, and
demonstrate the superiority of interference-exploitation precoding for both
scenarios.

consists in the extension of the linear elastic energy to higher powers of the

The twist-bend nematic modulated phase is investigated by both approaches and
the results are critically compared. The conical angle of the twist-bend phase
is calculated as function of the elastic constants. Surface-like effects are
considered. Finally, we demonstrate that a splay-bend nematic phase with small
oscillations of the nematic director around an axis is prohibited.

ensuring safe operation and stable power supply even when certain faults occur.
No matter such faults are caused by vulnerabilities of system components,
physical attacks, or cyber-attacks that are more related to cyber-security,
they eventually affect the physical stability of a power system. Examples of
the loss of physical stability include the Northeast blackout of 2003 in North
America and the 2015 system-wide blackout in Ukraine. The nonlinear hybrid
nature, that is, nonlinear continuous dynamics integrated with discrete
switching, and the high degree of freedom property of power system dynamics
make it challenging to conduct the dynamic security analysis. In this paper, we
use the hybrid automaton model to describe the dynamics of a power system and
mainly deal with the index-1 differential-algebraic equation models regarding
the continuous dynamics in different discrete states. The analysis problem is
formulated as a reachability problem of the associated hybrid model. A
sampling-based algorithm is then proposed by integrating modeling and
randomized simulation of the hybrid dynamics to search for a feasible execution
connecting an initial state of the post-fault system and a target set in the
desired operation mode. The proposed method enables the use of existing power
system simulators for the synthesis of discrete switching and control
strategies through randomized simulation. The effectiveness and performance of
the proposed approach are demonstrated with an application to the dynamic
security analysis of the New England 39-bus benchmark power system exhibiting
hybrid dynamics. In addition to evaluating the dynamic security, the proposed
method searches for a feasible strategy to ensure the dynamic security of the
system in face of disruptions.

slipping motion of the substructures within the negative-polarity flare ribbon
(R1) and continual reconnection-induced flows during the confined flare are
first presented. The substructures within ribbon R1 were observed to slip in
opposite directions at apparent speeds of 10-70 km s$^{-1}$. The slipping
motion exhibited the quasi-periodic pattern with a period of 80-110 s, which
can be observed since the flare start and throughout the impulsive phase of the
flare. Simultaneously quasi-periodic flows moved along a reverse-S shaped
filament, with an average period of about 90 s. The period of
reconnection-induced flows is similar to that of the slippage of ribbon
substructures, implying the occurrence of quasi-periodic slipping magnetic
reconnection. The spectral observations showed that the Si {\sc iv} line was
blueshifted by 50-240 km s$^{-1}$ at the location of the flows. During the
process of the flare, the filament did not show the rise phase and was not
associated with any failed eruption. The flare mainly consisted of two sets of
magnetic systems, with both of their east ends anchoring in ribbon R1. We
suggest that the slipping magnetic reconnection between two magnetic systems
triggers the confined flare.

photometric data of HD149404. Additional photometry was retrieved from the SMEI
archive. These data were analysed using a suite of period search tools. The
orbital part of the lightcurve was modelled with the nightfall binary star
code. The Gaia-DR2 parallax of HD149404 was used to provide additional
constraints. The periodograms reveal a clear orbital modulation of the
lightcurve with a peak-to-peak amplitude near 0.04 mag. The remaining
non-orbital part of the variability is consistent with red noise. The
lightcurve folded with the orbital period reveals ellipsoidal variations, but
no eclipses. The minimum when the secondary star is in inferior conjunction is
deeper than the other minimum due to mutual reflection effects between the
stars. Combined with the Gaia-DR2 parallaxes, the photometric data indicate an
orbital inclination in the range of 23{\deg} to 31{\deg} and a Roche lobe
filling factor of the secondary larger than or equal to 0.96. The luminosity of
the primary star is consistent with its present-day mass, whereas the more
evolved secondary appears overluminous for its mass. We confirm that the
primary's rotation period is about half the orbital period. Both features most
probably stem from the past Roche lobe overflow episode.

monocular camera, to autonomously avoid collisions with obstacles in
unstructured and unknown indoor environments. When compared to obstacle
avoidance in ground vehicular robots, UAV navigation brings in additional
challenges because the UAV motion is no more constrained to a well-defined
indoor ground or street environment. Horizontal structures in indoor and
outdoor environments like decorative items, furnishings, ceiling fans,
sign-boards, tree branches etc., also become relevant obstacles unlike those
for ground vehicular robots. Thus, methods of obstacle avoidance developed for
ground robots are clearly inadequate for UAV navigation. Current control
methods using monocular images for UAV obstacle avoidance are heavily dependent
on environment information. These controllers do not fully retain and utilize
the extensively available information about the ambient environment for
decision making. We propose a deep reinforcement learning based method for UAV
obstacle avoidance (OA) and autonomous exploration which is capable of doing
exactly the same. The crucial idea in our method is the concept of partial
observability and how UAVs can retain relevant information about the
environment structure to make better future navigation decisions. Our OA
technique uses recurrent neural networks with temporal attention and provides
better results compared to prior works in terms of distance covered during
navigation without collisions. In addition, our technique has a high inference
rate (a key factor in robotic applications) and is energy-efficient as it
minimizes oscillatory motion of UAV and reduces power wastage.

their Purcell Factor in the visible spectral range. In order to investigate how
the changes in geometry influence the fluorescence emission efficiency,
thiol-conjugated dyes are anchored on the plasmonic ring, thus forming a
functional nanopore. We study the lifetime of ATTO 520 and ATTO 590 attached in
two different configurations: single dye, and FRET pair. For the single dye
configuration, we observe that the lifetime of both single dyes decreases as
the size of the nanopore is reduced. The smallest nanopores yield an
experimental Purcell Factor of 6. For the FRET pair configuration, we measure
two regimes. For large nanopore sizes, the FRET efficiency remains constant.
Whereas for smaller sizes, the FRET efficiency increases from 30 up to 45% with
a decrease of the nanopore size. These findings, which have been also supported
by numerical simulations, may open new pathways to engineer the energy transfer

results verify that the proposed TTS systems with speaker-adaptive neural

attracted considerable interest. Electromagnetic responses of electrostatic
(ES) plasmon resonances in optics and magnetostatic (MS) magnon resonances in
microwaves give rise to a strong enhancement of local fields near the surfaces
of subwavelength particles. In the near-field regions of subwavelength
particles one can only measure the electric or the magnetic field with
accuracy. Such uncertainty in definition of the electric or magnetic field
components raises the question of energy eigenstates of quasistatic
oscillations. The energy eigenstate problem can be properly formulated when
potential functions, used in the quasistatic-resonance problems, are introduced
as scalar wave functions. In this case, one should observe quasistatic-wave
retardation effects still staying in frames of the quasistatic description of
oscillations in a subwavelength particle. In this paper, we analyze the problem
of energy quantization of ES resonances in subwavelength optical metallic
structures with plasmon oscillations and MS resonances in subwavelength

time scale of 5 minutes. The observations prove the white dwarf nature of the
hot component in the binary system. It is the 11th symbiotic star (among more
than 200 symbiotic stars known in our Galaxy) which displays optical
flickering. For SU Lyn we do not detect flickering with an amplitude above 0.03
mag in B band. For AG Peg, the amplitude of variability in B and V band is
smaller than 0.05 mag and 0.04 mag respectively.

previously reported TDNP semimetals. The Fermi arc surface states for the TDNPs

TDNPs can be tuned, and the TDNPs can even be annihilated. The centrosymmetry
in Li2NaN makes the TDNP transform into a critical type Dirac point under the
spin-orbit coupling, which is drastically distinct from those in
noncentrosymmetric systems. Such centrosymmetic TDNP semimetal has been rarely
identified in realistic materials.

problems with many predictors and many responses. We focus on detecting
hotspots, i.e., predictors associated with several responses. Such a task is
critical in statistical genetics, as hotspot genetic variants shape the
architecture of the genome by controlling the expression of many genes and may
initiate decisive functional mechanisms underlying disease endpoints. Existing
hierarchical regression approaches designed to model hotspots suffer from two
limitations: their discrimination of hotspots is sensitive to the choice of
top-level scale parameters for the propensity of predictors to be hotspots, and
they do not scale to large predictor and response vectors, e.g., of dimensions
$10^3-10^5$ in genetic applications. We address these shortcomings by
introducing a flexible hierarchical regression framework that is tailored to
the detection of hotspots and scalable to the above dimensions. Our proposal
implements a fully Bayesian model for hotspots based on the horseshoe shrinkage
prior. Its global-local formulation shrinks noise globally and hence
accommodates the highly sparse nature of genetic analyses, while being robust
to individual signals, thus leaving the effects of hotspots unshrunk. Inference
is carried out using a fast variational algorithm coupled with a novel
simulated annealing procedure that allows efficient exploration of multimodal
distributions.

interneuronal connection formation decreases exponentially with increasing

centers of a network spike, from where the synchronous spiking activity starts
propagating in the network typically in the form of circular traveling waves.
The number of nucleation centers and their spatial locations are unique and
unchanged for a given realization of neuronal network but are different for
different networks. In contrast, if the probability of interneuronal connection
formation is independent of the distance between neurons, then the nucleation
centers do not arise and the synchronization of spiking activity during a
network spike occurs spatially uniform throughout the network. Therefore one
can conclude that spatial proximity of connections between neurons is important
for the formation of nucleation centers. It is also shown that fluctuations of
the spatial density of neurons at their random homogeneous distribution typical

rounds (typically called {\em time complexity}). The problem admits
$(1+o(1))$-approximation $\tilde\Theta(n)$-time algorithm and a nearly-tight
$\tilde \Omega(n)$ lower bound [Nanongkai, STOC'14; Lenzen and Patt-Shamir
PODC'15]\footnote{$\tilde \Theta$, $\tilde O$ and $\tilde \Omega$ hide
polylogarithmic factors. Note that the lower bounds also hold even in the
unweighted case and in the weighted case with polynomial approximation
ratios~\cite{LenzenP_podc13,HolzerW12,PelegRT12,Nanongkai-STOC14}.}. For the
exact case, Elkin [STOC'17] presented an $O(n^{5/3} \log^{2/3} n)$ time bound,
which was later improved to $\tilde O(n^{5/4})$ [Huang, Nanongkai, Saranurak
FOCS'17]. It was shown that any super-linear lower bound (in $n$) requires a
new technique [Censor-Hillel, Khoury, Paz, DISC'17], but otherwise it remained
widely open whether there exists a $\tilde O(n)$-time algorithm for the exact
case, which would match the best possible approximation algorithm.
  This paper resolves this question positively: we present a randomized (Las
Vegas) $\tilde O(n)$-time algorithm, matching the lower bound up to
polylogarithmic factors. Like the previous $\tilde O(n^{5/4})$ bound, our
result works for directed graphs with zero (and even negative) edge weights. In
addition to the improved running time, our algorithm works in a more general
setting than that required by the previous $\tilde O(n^{5/4})$ bound; in our
setting (i) the communication is only along edge directions (as opposed to
bidirectional), and (ii) edge weights are arbitrary (as opposed to integers in
{1, 2, ... poly(n)}). ...

information. For example, online social platforms allow for seamless
communication exchanges at an unprecedented scale. However, we are still
bounded by cognitive and temporal constraints. Our attention is limited and
extremely valuable. Algorithmic personalisation has become a standard approach
to tackle the information overload problem. As result, the exposure to our
friends' opinions and our perception about important issues might be distorted.
However, the effects of algorithmic gatekeeping on our hyper-connected society
are poorly understood. Here, we devise an opinion dynamics model where
individuals are connected through a social network and adopt opinions as
function of the view points they are exposed to. We apply various filtering
algorithms that select the opinions shown to users i) at random ii) considering
time ordering or iii) their current beliefs. Furthermore, we investigate the
interplay between such mechanisms and crucial features of real networks. We
found that algorithmic filtering might influence opinions' share and
distributions, especially in case information is biased towards the current
opinion of each user. These effects are reinforced in networks featuring
topological and spatial correlations where echo chambers and polarisation
emerge. Conversely, heterogeneity in connectivity patterns reduces such
tendency. We consider also a scenario where one opinion, through nudging, is
centrally pushed to all users. Interestingly, even minimal nudging is able to
change the status quo moving it towards the desired view point. Our findings
suggest that simple filtering algorithms might be powerful tools to regulate
opinion dynamics taking place on social networks

an important parameter when characterizing small complex cavities such as ear

excursion $x(t)$ on the time interval $|t|\leq T$, constrained to stay away
from a moving wall $x_0(t)$ such that $x_0(-T)=x_0(T)=0$ and $x_0(|t|<T)>0$. We
focus on wall functions described by a family of generalized parabolas
$x_0(t)=T^{\gamma} [1-(t/T)^{2k}]$, where $k\geq 1$. Using the optimal
fluctuation method (OFM), we calculate the large deviation function (LDF) of
the area at long times. The OFM provides a simple description of the area
fluctuations in terms of optimal paths, or rays, of the Brownian motion. We
show that the LDF has a jump in the third derivative with respect to
$\mathcal{A}$ at a critical value of $\mathcal{A}$. This singularity results
from a qualitative change of the optimal path, and it can be interpreted as a
third-order dynamical phase transition. Although the OFM is not applicable for
typical (small) area fluctuations, we argue that it correctly captures their
power-law scaling of $\mathcal{A}$ with $T$ with an exponent that depends
continuously on $\gamma$ and on $k$. We also consider the cosine wall
$x_0(t)=T^{\gamma} \cos[\pi t/(2T)]$ to illustrate a different possible
behavior of the optimal path and of the scaling of typical fluctuations. For
some wall functions additional phase transitions, which result from a
coexistence of multiple OFM solutions, should be possible.

arguments, which relies solely on the structure of an argumentation framework,

introduces a graded generalization of the two key notions underpinning Dung's
semantics: self-defense and conflict-freeness. This leads to a natural
generalization of Dung's semantics, whereby standard extensions are weakened or
strengthened depending on the level of self-defense and conflict-freeness they
meet. The paper investigates the fixpoint theory of these semantics,
establishing existence results for them. Second, the paper shows how graded
semantics readily provide an approach to argument rankings, offering a novel
contribution to the recently growing research programme on ranking-based
semantics. Third, this novel approach to argument ranking is applied and
studied in the context of instantiated argumentation frameworks, and in so
doing is shown to account for a simple form of accrual of arguments within the
Dung paradigm. Finally, the theory is compared in detail with existing
approaches.

Moreover, we give a structure theorem for smooth polytopes with few lattice

Ising model on the square (2D) and simple-cubic (3D) lattices. The wrapping
probability, a dimensionless quantity characterizing the topology of the FK
clusters on a torus, is found to suffer from smaller finite-size corrections
than the well-known Binder ratio, and yields a high-precision critical coupling
as $K_c(3\rm D)=0.221\,654\,631(8)$. We then study geometric properties of the
FK clusters at criticality. It is demonstrated that the distribution of the
critical largest-cluster size $C_1$ follows a single-variable function as
$P(C_1,L){\rm d}C_1=\tilde P(x){\rm d}x$ with $x\equiv C_1/L^{d_{\rm F}}$ ($L$
is the linear size), and that the fractal dimension $d_{\rm F}$ is identical to
the magnetic exponent. An interesting bimodal feature is observed in
distribution $\tilde P(x)$ in 3D, and attributed to the different approaching
behaviors for $K \to K_c+0^\pm$. For a critical FK configuration, the cluster
number per site $n(s,L)$ of size $s$ is confirmed to obey the standard scaling
form $n(s,L)\sim s^{-\tau}\tilde n(s/L^{d_{\rm F}})$, with hyper-scaling
relation $\tau=1+d/d_{\rm F}$ and the spatial dimension $d$. To further
characterize the compactness of the FK clusters, we measure their graph
distances and determine the shortest-path exponents as $d_{\rm min}(3\rm
D)=1.259\,4(2)$ and $d_{\rm min}(2\rm D)=1.094\,0(3)$. Further, by excluding
all the bridges from the occupied bonds, we obtain bridge-free configurations
and determine the backbone exponents as $d_{\rm B}(3\rm D)=2.167\,3(15)$ and
$d_{\rm B}(2\rm D)=1.732\,1(4)$. The estimates of the universal wrapping
probabilities for the 3D Ising model and of the geometric critical exponents
$d_{\rm min}$ and $d_{\rm B}$ either improve over the existing results or have
not been reported yet.

which the top plate is replaced by a bianisotropic metasurface of the Omega
type. It is shown that there is an exact solution to transform the guided mode
into a leaky-mode with arbitrary control of the constant leakage factor and the
pointing direction. Although the solution turns out to be periodic, only one
Floquet mode is excited and radiates, even for electrically long periods.
Thanks to the intrinsic spurious Floquet mode suppression, broadside radiation
can be achieved without any degradation. Simulations with idealized reactance
sheets verify the concept. Moreover, physical structures compatible with PCB
fabrication have been proposed and designed, considering aspects such as the
effect of losses. Finally, experimental results of two prototypes are presented
and discussed.

technological research and describes the case when a new product steals sales
from another product under the same brand. A very special case of
cannibalisation may occur when the older product react to the competitive
strength of the newer one, absorbing the corresponding market shares. Given its
special character, we call this phenomenon inverse product cannibalisation. We
suppose that a case of inverse cannibalisation is observed between two products
of Apple Inc., the iPhone and the more recent iPad, and the first has been able
to succeed at the expense of the second. To explore this hypothesis, within a
diffusion of innovations perspective, we propose a modified Lotka-Volterra
model for mean trajectories in asymmetric competition, allowing us to test the
presence and the extent of the inverse cannibalisation phenomenon. A SARMAX
refinement integrates the short term predictions with seasonal and
autodependent components. A non-dimensional representation of the proposed
model shows that the penetration of the second technology has been beneficial
for the first, both in terms of market size and life cycle length.

ferromagnetic planes of K$_2$CuF$_4$ and LaMnO$_3$. As a result, dressed spin
excitations (magnons) obtained within the electronic model propagate as
quasiparticles and their energy renormalization depends on momentum ${\vec k}$.
Therefore magnons in spin-orbital systems go beyond the paradigm of the
effective Heisenberg model with nearest neighbor spin exchange derived from the
ground state --- spin-orbital entanglement in excited states predicts large
magnon softening at the Brillouin zone boundary, and in case of LaMnO$_3$ the
magnon energy at the $M=(\pi,\pi)$ point may be reduced by $\sim 45$\%. In
contrast, simultaneously the stiffness constant near the Goldstone mode is
almost unaffected. We elucidate physics behind magnon renormalization in
spin-orbital systems and explain why long wavelength magnons are unrenormalized
while simultaneously energies of short wavelength magnons are reduced by
orbital fluctuations. In fact, the ${\vec k}$-dependence of the magnon energy
is modified mainly by dispersion which originates from spin exchange between
second neighbors along the cubic axes $a$ and $b$.

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For many applications in the field of computer assisted surgery, such as
providing the position of a tumor, specifying the most probable tool required
next by the surgeon or determining the remaining duration of surgery, methods
for surgical workflow analysis are a prerequisite. Often machine learning based
approaches serve as basis for surgical workflow analysis. In general machine
learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), require large
amounts of labeled data. While data is often available in abundance, many tasks
in surgical workflow analysis need data annotated by domain experts, making it
difficult to obtain a sufficient amount of annotations.
  The aim of using active learning to train a machine learning model is to
reduce the annotation effort. Active learning methods determine which unlabeled
data points would provide the most information according to some metric, such
as prediction uncertainty. Experts will then be asked to only annotate these
data points. The model is then retrained with the new data and used to select
further data for annotation. Recently, active learning has been applied to CNN
by means of Deep Bayesian Networks (DBN). These networks make it possible to
assign uncertainties to predictions.
  In this paper, we present a DBN-based active learning approach adapted for
image-based surgical workflow analysis task. Furthermore, by using a recurrent
architecture, we extend this network to video-based surgical workflow analysis.
We evaluate these approaches on the Cholec80 dataset by performing instrument
presence detection and surgical phase segmentation. Here we are able to show
that using a DBN-based active learning approach for selecting what data points
to annotate next outperforms a baseline based on randomly selecting data
points.

  multimodal sensor data",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose The course of surgical procedures is often unpredictable, making it
difficult to estimate the duration of procedures beforehand. A context-aware
method that analyses the workflow of an intervention online and automatically
predicts the remaining duration would alleviate these problems. As basis for
such an estimate, information regarding the current state of the intervention
is required. Methods Today, the operating room contains a diverse range of
sensors. During laparoscopic interventions, the endoscopic video stream is an
ideal source of such information. Extracting quantitative information from the
video is challenging though, due to its high dimensionality. Other surgical
devices (e.g. insufflator, lights, etc.) provide data streams which are, in
contrast to the video stream, more compact and easier to quantify. Though
whether such streams offer sufficient information for estimating the duration
of surgery is uncertain. Here, we propose and compare methods, based on
convolutional neural networks, for continuously predicting the duration of
laparoscopic interventions based on unlabeled data, such as from endoscopic
images and surgical device streams. Results The methods are evaluated on 80
laparoscopic interventions of various types, for which surgical device data and
the endoscopic video are available. Here the combined method performs best with
an overall average error of 37% and an average halftime error of 28%.
Conclusion In this paper, we present, to our knowledge, the first approach for
online procedure duration prediction using unlabeled endoscopic video data and
surgical device data in a laparoscopic setting. We also show that a method
incorporating both vision and device data performs better than methods based
only on vision, while methods only based on tool usage and surgical device data
perform poorly, showing the importance of the visual channel.

role in the majority of outstanding investigations in low-dimensional electron

demonstrate a variety of subtle physical effects. The strain leads to a bulk
band gap but limits a maximum HgTe strained film thickness, and therefore, the
majority of experiments were performed on films with a thickness of less than
100 nm. Since a spatial separation of topological states is crucial for the
study of a single-surface response, it is essential to increase the HgTe
thickness further. In this work, by combining transport measurements together
with capacitance spectroscopy, we perform an analysis of a 200-nm partially
relaxed HgTe film. The Drude fit of the classical magnetotransport reveals the
ambipolar electron-hole transport with a high electron mobility. A detailed
analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in both conductivity and capacitance
allows us to distinguish three groups of electrons, identified as electrons on
top and bottom surfaces and bulk electrons. The indirect bulk energy gap value
is found to be close to zero. It is established that the significant gap
decrease does not affect the surface states, which are found to be well
resolved and spin nondegenerate. The presented techniques allow investigations
of other three-dimensional TIs, regardless of the presence of bulk
conductivity.

wide range of amplitude and frequency of light. When the frequency is larger

In this paper we analyse consequences of these dualities from the perspective
of the partition functions $\mathcal{Z}_{N,M}$ (or the free energy
$\mathcal{F}_{N,M}$) of these theories. Focusing on the case $M=1$, we find
that the latter is invariant under the group $\mathbb{G}(N)\times S_N$: here
$S_N$ corresponds to the Weyl group of the largest gauge group that can be
engineered from $X_{N,1}$ and $\mathbb{G}(N)$ is a dihedral group, which acts
in an intrinsically non-perturbative fashion and which is of infinite order for
$N\geq 4$. We give an explicit representation of $\mathbb{G}(N)$ as a matrix
group that is freely generated by two elements which act naturally on a
specific basis of the K\""ahler moduli space of $X_{N,1}$. While we show the
invariance of $\mathcal{Z}_{N,1}$ under $\mathbb{G}(N)\times S_N$ in full
generality, we provide explicit checks by series expansions of
$\mathcal{F}_{N,1}$ for a large number of examples. We also comment on the
relation of $\mathbb{G}(N)$ to the modular group that arises due to the

characterization of exoplanet systems and their atmospheres. Atmospheric
retrieval, the inverse modeling technique used to determine an exoplanetary
atmosphere's temperature structure and composition from an observed spectrum,
is both time-consuming and compute-intensive, requiring complex algorithms that
compare thousands to millions of atmospheric models to the observational data
to find the most probable values and associated uncertainties for each model
parameter. For rocky, terrestrial planets, the retrieved atmospheric
composition can give insight into the surface fluxes of gaseous species
necessary to maintain the stability of that atmosphere, which may in turn
provide insight into the geological and/or biological processes active on the
planet. These atmospheres contain many molecules, some of them biosignatures,
spectral fingerprints indicative of biological activity, which will become
observable with the next generation of telescopes. Runtimes of traditional
retrieval models scale with the number of model parameters, so as more

representations. Traditionally, data representations were hand-crafted.
Recently it has been demonstrated that, given sufficient data, deep neural
networks can learn effective implicit representations from simple input
representations. However, for most scientific problems, the use of deep
learning is not appropriate as the amount of available data is limited, and/or
the output models must be explainable. Nevertheless, many scientific problems
do have significant amounts of data available on related tasks, which makes
them amenable to multi-task learning, i.e. learning many related problems
simultaneously. Here we propose a novel and general representation learning
approach for multi-task learning that works successfully with small amounts of
data. The fundamental new idea is to transform an input intrinsic data
representation (i.e., handcrafted features), to an extrinsic representation
based on what a pre-trained set of models predict about the examples. This
transformation has the dual advantages of producing significantly more accurate
predictions, and providing explainable models. To demonstrate the utility of
this transformative learning approach, we have applied it to three real-world
scientific problems: drug-design (quantitative structure activity relationship
learning), predicting human gene expression (across different tissue types and
drug treatments), and meta-learning for machine learning (predicting which
machine learning methods work best for a given problem). In all three problems,
transformative machine learning significantly outperforms the best intrinsic
representation.

then reveals that while for a given dimension, the magnitude of quantum

gives rise to fully populated matrices which are approximated by the $\mathcal

robust and flexible, allowing a straightforward generalisation to vector-valued

automatic derivation of Bayesian signal processing algorithms, including
algorithms for parameter estimation and model comparison. Crucially, due to the
modular makeup of the FFG framework, both the model specification and inference
methods are readily extensible in ForneyLab. In order to test this framework,
we compared variational message passing as implemented by ForneyLab with
automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) and Monte Carlo methods

performance, extensibility and stability issues, ForneyLab appears to enjoy an

As a consequence, a maximum p-type ZT value of ~1.8 can be realized along the

to extract image derived features to characterize the shape and motion of the
heart. An original semi-supervised learning procedure, which makes efficient
use of a large amount of non-segmented images and a small amount of images
segmented manually by experts, is developed to generate pixel-wise apparent
flow between two time points of a 2D+t cine MRI image sequence. Combining the
apparent flow maps and cardiac segmentation masks, we obtain a local apparent
flow corresponding to the 2D motion of myocardium and ventricular cavities.
This leads to the generation of time series of the radius and thickness of
myocardial segments to represent cardiac motion. These time series of motion
features are reliable and explainable characteristics of pathological cardiac
motion. Furthermore, they are combined with shape-related features to classify
cardiac pathologies. Using only nine feature values as input, we propose an
explainable, simple and flexible model for pathology classification. On ACDC
training set and testing set, the model achieves 95% and 94% respectively as
classification accuracy. Its performance is hence comparable to that of the
state-of-the-art. Comparison with various other models is performed to outline
some advantages of our model.

however, there could be many other pooling types, such as geometric average,
harmonic average, and so on. Since it is not easy for algorithms to find the

might not be optimal for different tasks. In line with the deep learning
philosophy, the type of pooling can be driven by data for a given task. In this
paper, we propose {\it $\alpha$-integration pooling} ($\alpha$I-pooling), which
has a trainable parameter $\alpha$ to find the type of pooling.
$\alpha$I-pooling is a general pooling method including max-pooling and
arithmetic average-pooling as a special case, depending on the parameter
$\alpha$. Experiments show that $\alpha$I-pooling outperforms other pooling

state based distributed Kalman filter (DKF) is proposed for simultaneously
estimating both system state and uncertain dynamics. To alleviate the effect of
observation biases, an event-triggered update based DKF is presented with a
tighter mean square error bound than that of the time-driven one by designing a
proper threshold. Both the two DKFs are shown to provide the upper bounds of
mean square errors online for each sensor. Under mild conditions on systems and

proposed two DKFs are proved. Finally, the numerical simulations demonstrate
the effectiveness of the developed filters.

We have achieved around 3.4% and 4.5% better F-1 score for nuclei

carried out for each isotope record separately, as well as for their composite.
We present the first ever SSI reconstruction over the last 9000 years from the
individual 14C and 10Be records as well as from their newest composite. The
reconstruction employs physics-based models to describe the involved processes
at each step of the procedure. Irradiance reconstructions based on two
different cosmogenic isotope records, those of 14C and 10Be, agree well with
each other in their long-term trends despite their different geochemical paths

variability in TSI is of the order of 0.11%, or 1.5 W/m2. After the Maunder
minimum, the reconstruction from the cosmogenic isotopes is consistent with
that from the direct sunspot number observation. Furthermore, over the
nineteenth century, the agreement of irradiance reconstructions using isotope
records with the reconstruction from the sunspot number by Chatzistergos et al.

recently predicted single-layer pentagonal CoS$_2$ that is an antiferromagnetic
(AFM) semiconductor, we replace two S atoms by As atoms in a unit cell to form
single-layer pentagonal CoAsS. The resulting single-layer material is
dynamically stable ac-cording to the phonon calculations. We find two drastic
changes in the properties of single-layer pentagonal CoAsS in comparison with
those of CoS$_2$. First, we find a magnetic transition from the AFM to FM
ordering. We understand that the transition is caused by the lower
electronegativity of As atoms, leading to the weakened bridging roles on the
superexchange interactions be-tween Co ions. Single-layer pentagonal CoAsS also
shows significantly stronger magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy due to
stronger spin-orbit coupling. We additionally perform Monte Carlo simulations
to calculate the Curie temperature of single-layer pentagonal CoAsS and the
predicted Curie temperature is 103 K. Second, we find that single-layer
pentagonal CoAsS exhibits piezoelectricity, which is absent in single-layer
pentagonal CoS$_2$ due to its center of symmetry. The computed piezoelectric
coefficients are also sizable. The rare coexistence of FM ordering and
piezoelectric properties makes single-layer pentagonal CoAsS a promising

light neutrino masses. It postulates a SU(2)$_\mathrm{L}$-triplet scalar field,
which develops an induced vacuum expectation value after electroweak symmetry
breaking, giving masses to the neutrinos via its couplings to the lepton
SU(2)$_\mathrm{L}$-doublets. When the components of the triplet field have
masses around the electroweak scale, the model features a rich phenomenology.
We discuss the current allowed parameter space of the minimal low scale type II
seesaw model, taking into account all relevant constraints, including charged
lepton flavour violation as well as collider searches. We point out that the
symmetry protected low scale type II seesaw scenario, where an approximate
""lepton number""-like symmetry suppresses the Yukawa couplings of the triplet to
the lepton doublets, is still largely untested by the current LHC results. In
part of this parameter space the triplet components can be long-lived,
potentially leading to a characteristic displaced vertex signature where the
doubly-charged component decays into same-sign charged leptons. By performing a
detailed analysis at the reconstructed level we find that already at the
current run of the LHC a discovery would be possible for the considered
parameter point, via dedicated searches for displaced vertex signatures. The
discovery prospects are further improved at the HL-LHC and the FCC-hh/SppC.

factor to zero), revealing that the spectrogram can be down-sampled and thus
compressed without the cost of lowered quality. In addition, we integrate this
new method with conventional speech enhancement algorithms, including spectral

result, this new method is quite effective in improving the speech quality and

determining the chemical composition of interstellar ices. On the dust surface,
adsorbed species diffuse from one potential well to another and react with
other adsorbed reactants, resulting in the formation of simple and complex
molecules. Aims: We study the impact on the abundances of the species simulated
by the chemical codes by considering the uncertainties in the diffusion energy
of adsorbed species. We aim to limit the uncertainties in the abundances as
calculated by chemical codes by identifying the surface species that result in
a larger error because of the uncertainties in their diffusion energy. Methods:
We ran various cases with 2000 to 10000 simulations in each case and varied the
diffusion energies of some or all surface species randomly. We calculated
Pearson correlation coefficients between the abundances and the ratio of
diffusion to binding energy of adsorbed species. We identified the species that
introduce maximum uncertainty in the ice and gas-phase abundances. With these
species we ran three sets, with 2000 simulations in each, to quantify the
uncertainties they introduce. Results: We present the abundances of various
molecules in the gas phase and also on the dust surface at different time
intervals during the simulation. We show which species produce a large
uncertainty in the abundances. We sorted species into different groups in
accordance with their importance in propagating uncertainty in the chemical
network. Conclusions: We show that CO, H$_2$, O, N, and CH$_3$ are the key
species for uncertainties in the abundances, while CH$_2$, HCO, S and O$_2$
come next, followed by NO, HS, and CH. We also show that by limiting the
uncertainties in the ratio of diffusion to binding energy of these species, we
can eliminate the uncertainties in the gas-phase abundances of almost all the
species.

\mathbb{R}$ are its degree at most $d$ Fourier coefficients. It is well-known
that degree-$d$ Chow parameters uniquely characterize degree-$d$ polynomial
threshold functions (PTFs) within the space of all bounded functions. In this
paper, we prove a robust version of this theorem: For $f$ any Boolean
degree-$d$ PTF and $g$ any bounded function, if the degree-$d$ Chow parameters
of $f$ are close to the degree-$d$ Chow parameters of $g$ in $\ell_2$-norm,
then $f$ is close to $g$ in $\ell_1$-distance. Notably, our bound relating the
two distances is completely independent of the dimension $n$. That is, we show
that Boolean degree-$d$ PTFs are {\em robustly identifiable} from their
degree-$d$ Chow parameters. Results of this form had been shown for the $d=1$
case~\cite{OS11:chow, DeDFS14}, but no non-trivial bound was previously known
for $d >1$.
  Our robust identifiability result gives the following algorithmic
applications: First, we show that Boolean degree-$d$ PTFs can be efficiently
approximately reconstructed from approximations to their degree-$d$ Chow
parameters. This immediately implies that degree-$d$ PTFs are efficiently
learnable in the uniform distribution $d$-RFA
model~\cite{BenDavidDichterman:98}. As a byproduct of our approach, we also

  https://youtu.be/-8r7zexg4yg",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative Adversarial Networks have shown impressive results for the task of
object translation, including face-to-face translation. A key component behind
the success of recent approaches is the self-consistency loss, which encourages
a network to recover the original input image when the output generated for a
desired attribute is itself passed through the same network, but with the
target attribute inverted. While the self-consistency loss yields
photo-realistic results, it can be shown that the input and target domains,
supposed to be close, differ substantially. This is empirically found by
observing that a network recovers the input image even if attributes other than
the inversion of the original goal are set as target. This stops one combining
networks for different tasks, or using a network to do progressive forward
passes. In this paper, we show empirical evidence of this effect, and propose a
new loss to bridge the gap between the distributions of the input and target
domains. This ""triple consistency loss"", aims to minimise the distance between
the outputs generated by the network for different routes to the target,
independent of any intermediate steps. To show this is effective, we
incorporate the triple consistency loss into the training of a new
landmark-guided face to face synthesis, where, contrary to previous works, the
generated images can simultaneously undergo a large transformation in both
expression and pose. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to tackle
the problem of mismatching distributions in self-domain synthesis, and to
propose ""in-the-wild"" landmark-guided synthesis. Code will be available at

cosmological test. In the standard model, for a matter dominated universe, the
growth of the density perturbations evolves with redshift z like (1/{1+z))^s
with s=1. This is not fast enough to form galaxies and to account for the
observed present-day inhomogeneities. This problem is usually resolved by
assuming that at the recombination epoch the baryons settle down in the
potential well of the dark matter previously assembled during the radiation era
of the universe. This view is challenged in the present paper by using the
recently proposed model of a scale-invariant framework for cosmology that
enlarges the invariance group subtending the theory of the gravitation.
  From the continuity equation, the Euler and Poisson equations written in the
scale-invariant framework, the equation governing the growth of the density
fluctuations is obtained. Starting from \delta = 10^{-5} at a redshift around
1000, numerical solutions for various density background are obtained. The
growth of density fluctuations is much faster than in the standard EdS model.
The s values are in the range from 2.7 to 3.9 for \Omega_m between 0.30 and
0.02. This enables the density fluctuations to enter the nonlinear regime with
\delta > 1 long before the present time, typically at redshifts of about 10,
without requiring the presence of dark matter.

using the full Planck 2015 CMB likelihood. The performance of the $\Lambda$CDM

show that the subset of $CMB+BAO+LSS$ observations may contain the bulk of the
DDE signal. The departure from $w=-1$ is significant: roughly $2.6\sigma$ for
XCDM and $2.9\sigma$ for $\Phi$CDM. In both cases the full Bayesian evidence is
found to be positive even for a prior range of the DDE parameters extending
over several standard deviations from the mean when the bispectrum is taken
into account. Positive signs follow as well from the preliminary results of

learning tasks. Recently, a range of approaches based on graph kernels or graph
neural networks have been developed for graph classification and for
representation learning on graphs in general. As the developed methodologies
become more sophisticated, it is important to understand which components of
the increasingly complex methods are necessary or most effective.
  As a first step, we develop a simple yet meaningful graph representation, and
explore its effectiveness in graph classification. We test our baseline
representation for the graph classification task on a range of graph datasets.
Interestingly, this simple representation achieves similar performance as the
state-of-the-art graph kernels and graph neural networks for non-attributed
graph classification. Its performance on classifying attributed graphs is
slightly weaker as it does not incorporate attributes. However, given its
simplicity and efficiency, we believe that it still serves as an effective
baseline for attributed graph classification. Our graph representation is
efficient (linear-time) to compute. We also provide a simple connection with
the graph neural networks.
  Note that these observations are only for the task of graph classification
while existing methods are often designed for a broader scope including node
embedding and link prediction. The results are also likely biased due to the
limited amount of benchmark datasets available. Nevertheless, the good
performance of our simple baseline calls for the development of new, more
comprehensive benchmark datasets so as to better evaluate and analyze different
graph learning methods. Furthermore, given the computational efficiency of our
graph summary, we believe that it is a good candidate as a baseline method for
future graph classification (or even other graph learning) studies.

contains a frequency-dependent compressibility factor for the Fermi liquid and
qualitatively resolves this issue. For a quantitative assessment, these results
are contrasted with those obtained for the more fundamental Boltzmann-Mermin

Consider a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a unique source vertex $X$, and
suppose all other vertices have indegree $d\geq 2$. Let the vertices at
distance $k$ from $X$ be called layer $k$. At layer $0$, $X$ is given a random
bit. At layer $k\geq 1$, each vertex receives $d$ bits from its parents in
layer $k-1$, which are transmitted along independent binary symmetric channel
edges, and combines them using a $d$-ary Boolean processing function. The goal
is to reconstruct $X$ with probability of error bounded away from $1/2$ using
the values of all vertices at an arbitrarily deep layer. This question is
closely related to models of reliable computation and storage, and information
flow in biological networks.
  In this paper, we analyze randomly constructed DAGs, for which we show that
broadcasting is only possible if the noise level is below a certain degree and
function dependent critical threshold. For $d\geq 3$, and random DAGs with
layer sizes $\Omega(\log k)$ and majority processing functions, we identify the
critical threshold. For $d=2$, we establish a similar result for NAND
processing functions. We also prove a partial converse for odd $d\geq 3$
illustrating that the identified thresholds are impossible to improve by
selecting different processing functions if the decoder is restricted to using
a single vertex.
  Finally, for any noise level, we construct explicit DAGs (using expander
graphs) with bounded degree and layer sizes $\Theta(\log k)$ admitting
reconstruction. In particular, we show that such DAGs can be generated in
deterministic quasi-polynomial time or randomized polylogarithmic time in the
depth. These results portray a doubly-exponential advantage for storing a bit
in DAGs compared to trees, where $d=1$ but layer sizes must grow exponentially
with depth in order to enable broadcasting.

of neutron stars and the implied physics, even being used to detect directly
gravitational waves. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the pulsar timing is
seriously affected by the spin-down irregularities, such as spin fluctuations
with a manifestation of low frequency structures (the so-called red noise
processes), and various activities of magnetospheres. Except from the random
timing noise, significant periodic or quasi-periodic components could also be
found in some timing residuals of pulsars, indicating the presence of
unmodelled deterministic effects. The physical origins of these effects still
remain unexplained. In this paper, we suggest a new mechanism involving the de
Haas-van Alphen magnetic oscillation, which could trigger the observed low
frequency structures. We find that the proposed magnetic oscillation period is
about 1-$10^{2}$ yr, which is about $10^{-4}$ times as long as the classical
characteristic time scale of interior magnetic field evolution for a normal
neutron star. Due to the magnetic oscillation, we estimate both the braking
index range between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{5}$ and the residuals range between 4 to
906 ms for some specific samples of quasi-periodic pulsars. Those are
consistent with the pulsar timing observations. Nonlinear phenomena of de
Haas-van Alphen effect and the Condon domain structure are considered.
Avalanche-like magnetized process of domain wall motion (rapidly magnetic

that is crucial for the treatment of the Gibbs' problem and the consistency of
its solution with conventional thermodynamics. Quantum mechanics provides a
quantitative criterion, not possible in the classical picture, for the degree
of indistinguishability in terms of visibility of quantum interference, or

individual has bounded memory and shares the common goal of learning the best
arm/option. We say an individual learns the best option if eventually (as $t\to
\infty$) it pulls only the arm with the highest expected reward. While this
goal is provably impossible for an isolated individual due to bounded memory,
we show that, in social groups, this goal can be achieved easily with the aid
of social persuasion (i.e., communication) as long as the communication
networks/graphs satisfy some mild conditions. To deal with the interplay
between the randomness in the rewards and in the social interaction, we employ
the {\em mean-field approximation} method. Considering the possibility that the
individuals in the networks may not be exchangeable when the communication
networks are not cliques, we go beyond the classic mean-field techniques and
apply a refined version of mean-field approximation:
  (1) Using coupling we show that, if the communication graph is connected and
is either regular or has doubly-stochastic degree-weighted adjacency matrix,
with probability $\to 1$ as the social group size $N \to \infty$, every
individual in the social group learns the best option.
  (2) If the minimum degree of the graph diverges as $N \to \infty$, over an
arbitrary but given finite time horizon, the sample paths describing the
opinion evolutions of the individuals are asymptotically independent. In
addition, the proportions of the population with different opinions converge to
the unique solution of a system of ODEs. In the solution of the obtained ODEs,
the proportion of the population holding the correct opinion converges to $1$
exponentially fast in time.
  Notably, our results hold even if the communication graphs are highly sparse.

obtain correct locations depends on the horizontal separation between object
and instrument. In fact, if their horizontal separation is zero the speed
needed for correct location must also be zero. In light of this singularity,
methods are derived for generating extremely reliable confidence intervals for
location and identifying regions of the 2D model where a 3D model is needed.
Because speeds needed for correct location are spatially in-homogeneous in the
extreme, isosigmachrons and isodiachrons emerge as natural geometries for
interpreting location instead of ellipses and hyperbolas. These issues are
caused by choice of coordinates, and the same phenomena occur in general
relativity regarding the speed of light and black holes.

Very Large Array (VLA). We present the first VLA radio image that detects the
radio lobes. We use both the 151 MHz luminosity, as a surrogate for the
isotropic radio lobe luminosity, and the lobe flux density from the radio image
to estimate a long term, time averaged, jet power, $\overline{Q} =1.5\pm 0.7

strong broad emission lines and estimate the thermal bolometric luminosity of
the accretion flow, $L_{\rm{bol}} = 6.7 \pm 3.0 \times 10^{46}
\rm{ergs~s^{-1}}$. The ratio, $\overline{Q}/L_{\rm{bol}} = 3.3 \pm 2.6 $, is at
the limit of this empirical metric of jet dominance seen in radio loud quasars
and this is the most luminous accretion flow to have this limiting behavior.
Despite being a very luminous blazar, it previously had no $\gamma$-ray
detections (EGRET, AGILE or FERMI) until December 11 - 13 2016 (54 hours) when
FERMI detected a flare that we analyze here. The isotropic apparent luminosity
from 100 MeV - 100 GeV rivals the most luminous detected blazar flares
(averaged over 18 hours), $\sim 5-6 \times 10^{49} \rm{ergs~s^{-1}}$. The
$\gamma$-ray luminosity varies over time by two orders of magnitude,
highlighting the extreme role of Doppler abberation and geometric alignment in
producing the inverse Compton emission.

disagreement between the treatments of time in general relativity and quantum
theory, the problem of recovering time from within an isolated Universe and the
prevalence of a unidirectional time flow (i.e., the so-called arrow of time).
Under our interpretation, general relativity and quantum theory have
complementary time treatments given that they emerge from a theory of a more
fundamental nature. To model an isolated Universe, we use the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation and then apply the Page-Wootters method of recovering time. It is
argued that, if the recovery of an experience of time is indeed viable in this
framework, interactions and quantum entanglement are both essential features,
even though the former is normally an afterthought or altogether dismissed. As
for the one-way arrow of time, this is, from our perspective, a consequence of
including the aforementioned interactions. But underlying our interpretation,
and pretty much all others, is the necessity for causality. It is this
fundamental tenet which accounts for our experience of time but yet can only be
postulated. Our conclusion is that the `problem of causality' is what should be
the focal point of future investigations.

load and its heritability. As set-point viral load distributions can differ
significantly amongst epidemics, it is imperative to account for the observed
local variation. This can be done by using a heritability model and fitting it
to a local set-point viral load distribution. However, as the fitting procedure
needs to take into account the actual transmission dynamics (i.e., social
network, sexual behaviour), a complex model is required. Furthermore, in order
to use the estimates in subsequent modelling analyses to inform prevention
policies, it is important to assess parameter robustness.
  In order to fit set-point viral load models without the need to capture
explicitly the transmission dynamics, we present a new protocol. Firstly, we
approximate the transmission network from a phylogeny that was inferred from
sequences collected in the local epidemic. Secondly, as this transmission
network only comprises a single instance of the transmission network space, and
our aim is to assess parameter robustness, we infer the transmission network
distribution. Thirdly, we fit the parameters of the selected set-point viral
load model on multiple samples from the transmission network distribution using
approximate Bayesian inference.
  Our new protocol enables researchers to fit set-point viral load models in
their local context, and diagnose the model parameter's uncertainty. Such
parameter estimates are essential to enable subsequent modelling analyses, and
thus crucial to improve prevention policies.

contributes the software-programmable wireless environment, consisting of
several HyperSurface tiles (programmable metasurfaces) controlled by a central

hence, electromagnetic behavior can be altered and controlled via a software
