(Feshbach) resonances, which are strongly dependent on the relative momentum of
colliding atom pairs, and important for simulating neutron matter with
ultracold atomic gases. We demonstrate a two-field optical vernier, which
expands kHz (mG) magnetic field detunings near a narrow resonance into MHz
optical field detunings, enabling precise control and characterization of the
momentum-dependent scattering amplitude. Two-photon loss spectra are measured
for the narrow resonance in $^6$Li, revealing rich structure in very good
agreement with our theoretical model. However, anomalous frequency shifts
between the measured and predicted two-photon spectra are not yet explained.

where an ensemble of agents is to be controlled such that both the aggregate

acceptable. In many applications, traditional PI control is used to regulate
aggregate ensemble performance. Our principal contribution in this note is to
demonstrate that PI control may not be always suitable for this purpose, and in
some situations may lead to a loss of ergodicity for closed-loop systems.
Building on this observation, a theoretical framework is proposed to both

for a description of mixed phases and can be used, e.g., for mimicking
transitions between pasta structures occuring in the crust as well as in the
inner core of compact stars. This interpolation method is based on assuming
switch functions that are used to define a mixture of subphases while
fulfilling constraints of thermodynamic stability. The width of the transition
depends on a free parameter, the pressure increment relative to the critical
pressure of a Maxwell construction. As an example we present a trigonometric
function ansatz for the switch function together with a pressure increment
during the transition. We note that the resulting mixed phase equation of state
bears similarities with the appearance of substitutional compounds in neutron
star crusts and with the sequence of transitions between different pasta phases
in the hadron-to-quark matter transition. We apply this method to the case of a
hadron-to-quark matter transition and test the robustness of the compact star
mass twin phenomenon against the appearance of pasta phases modeled in this
way.

introduce new rest frame broad bands (UV and blue) that can be derived directly

can be recovered quantatively without correction, and all qualitative trends
seen in the one halo term are recovered. In this analysis mixing between

as abstract building blocks with a uniform and consistent interface. The main
advantage is enhanced scriptability and empowering pipeline composition.
Formalization is realized by bundling a container with a Kliko file, which
describes the IO and task parameters. This Kliko container can then be opened
and run by a Kliko runner. The Kliko runner will parse the Kliko definition and
gather the values for these parameters, for example by requesting user input or
retrieving pre-defined values from disk. Parameters can be various primitive
types, for example: float, int or the path to a file. This paper will also
discuss the implementation of a support library named Kliko which can be used
to create Kliko containers, parse Kliko definitions, chain Kliko containers in
workflows using a workflow manager library such as Luigi. The Kliko library can
be used inside the container to interact with the Kliko runner. Finally, to
illustrate the applicability of the Kliko definition, this paper will discuss
two reference implementations based on the Kliko library: RODRIGUES, a

maximum-likelihood parameters of a latent variable model given observed data by
alternating between taking expectations of sufficient statistics, and
maximizing the expected log likelihood. For situations where sufficient
statistics are intractable, stochastic approximation EM (SAEM) is often used,
which uses Monte Carlo techniques to approximate the expected log likelihood.
Two common implementations of SAEM, Batch EM (BEM) and online EM (OEM), are
parameterized by a ""learning rate"", and their efficiency depend strongly on
this parameter. We propose an extension to the OEM algorithm, termed
Introspective Online Expectation Maximization (IOEM), which removes the need
for specifying this parameter by adapting the learning rate according to trends
in the parameter updates. We show that our algorithm matches the efficiency of
the optimal BEM and OEM algorithms in multiple models, and that the efficiency
of IOEM can exceed that of BEM/OEM methods with optimal learning rates when the
model has many parameters. A Python implementation is available at

analytically in small deformation regime. Our theoretical results show
excellent agreement with the numerical and shows improvement over previous
theoretical models. For drops falling with moderate Reynolds number, the effect
of Masson number on transient drop dynamics is studied for (i) perfect
dielectric drop in perfect dielectric medium (ii) leaky dielectric drop in the
leaky dielectric medium. For the latter case transient deformation and velocity
obtained for significant charge convection is compared with that of absence in
charge convection which is the novelty of our study. The present study suggests
that for both the regimes, surface charge convection tends to increase or
decrease the settling speed depending upon the ratios of electrical properties.
Notably, in the inertial regime, deformation and velocity are seen to be
altered prominently in the existence of significant charge convection.

structures for an embedded-atom-method model of the $\Sigma 5 (310) [001]$

Frenkel-Ladd thermodynamic integration method through molecular dynamics
simulations. It is shown that the free-energy curves predict a
temperature-induced first-order interfacial phase transition in the GB

Moreover, the role of vibrational entropy in the stabilization of the
high-temperature GB phase is clarified. The calculated results are able to
determine the GB phase stability at homologous temperatures less than $0.5$, a
temperature range particularly important given the limitation of the methods
available hitherto in modeling GB phase transitions at low temperatures. The
calculation of GB free energies complements currently available $0\,\mathrm{K}$
GB structure search methods, making feasible the characterization of GB phase

CPU and the slowmemory, may reveal sensitive information of a program, thus
allowing an adversary to conduct side-channel attacks. Existing methods for
detecting timing leaks either ignore cache all together or focus only on
passive leaks generated by the program itself, without considering leaks that
are made possible by concurrently running some other threads. In this work, we
show that timing-leak-freedom is not a compositional property: a program that
is not leaky when running alone may become leaky when interleaved with other
threads. Thus, we develop a new method, named adversarial symbolic execution,
to detect such leaks. It systematically explores both the feasible program
paths and their interleavings while modeling the cache, and leverages an SMT
solver to decide if there are timing leaks. We have implemented our method in
LLVM and evaluated it on a set of real-world ciphers with 14,455 lines of C
code in total. Our experiments demonstrate both the efficiency of our method
and its effectiveness in detecting side-channel leaks.

necessity to produce a large contribution to a quark times a lepton current,
$J_q \times J_\ell$, and to avoid accordingly large contributions to
flavour-changing $J_q \times J_q$ and $J_\ell \times J_\ell$ amplitudes, which
are severely constrained by data. We consider a gauged horizontal symmetry
involving the two heaviest generations of all left-handed fermions. In the
limit of degenerate masses for the horizontal bosons, and in the absence of

to the CKM matrix, and the above mechanism turns out to be challenged by
constraints such as $D^0 -\bar D^0$ mixing. Nonetheless, we show that a
simultaneous description of all data can be accomplished by simply allowing for
non-degenerate masses for the horizontal bosons. Such scenario predicts
modifications in several processes that can be tested at present and upcoming

  outcrop models and its implications on the development of fracture systems","23 pages, 10 figures",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The initiation and development of fractures in rocks is the key part of many
problems from academic to industrial, such as faulting, folding, rock mass
engineering, reservoir characterization, etc. Conventional ways of evaluating
the fracture historical deformations depend on the geologists' visual
interpretation of indicating structures such as fault striations, fault steps,
plumose structures, etc. on the fracture surface produced by previous
deformations, and hence suffer from problems like subjectivity and the absence
of obvious indicating structures. In this study, we propose a quantitative
method to derive historical shear deformations of rock fractures from digital
outcrop models (DOMs) based on the analysis of effects of fault striations and
fault steps on the shear strength parameter of the fracture surface. A
theoretical model that combines effects of fault striations, fault steps and
isotropic base shear strength is fitted to the shear strength parameter. The
amount of fault striations and fault steps and their occurrences are estimated,
and the historical shear deformations can be inferred. The validity and the
effectiveness of the proposed method was proved by testing it on a constructed
fracture surface with idealized striations and a fracture surface with clear
fault steps. The application of this method on an example outcrop shows an
intuitive idea of how the rock mass was deformed and that the distribution,
occurrence and mode of new fractures are strictly controlled by preexisting
fractures, and hence emphasizes the importance of preexisting fractures in
modeling the development of fracture systems.

number of latent types characterized by their private values for the good on
sale, we investigate revenue maximization in stochastic dynamic pricing when
the distribution of buyers' private values is supported on an unknown set of
points in [0,1] of unknown cardinality $K$. This setting can be viewed as an
instance of a stochastic $K$-armed bandit problem where the location of the
arms (the $K$ unknown valuations) must be learned as well. In the
distribution-free case, we prove that our setting is just as hard as $K$-armed
stochastic bandits: no algorithm can achieve a regret significantly better than
$\sqrt{KT}$, (where T is the time horizon); we present an efficient algorithm
matching this lower bound up to logarithmic factors. In the
distribution-dependent case, we show that for all $K>2$ our setting is strictly
harder than $K$-armed stochastic bandits by proving that it is impossible to
obtain regret bounds that grow logarithmically in time or slower. On the other
hand, when a lower bound $\gamma>0$ on the smallest drop in the demand curve is
known, we prove an upper bound on the regret of order $(1/\Delta+(\log \log
T)/\gamma^2)(K\log T)$. This is a significant improvement on previously known
regret bounds for discontinuous demand curves, that are at best of order
$(K^{12}/\gamma^8)\sqrt{T}$. When $K=2$ in the distribution-dependent case, the
hardness of our setting reduces to that of a stochastic $2$-armed bandit: we
prove that an upper bound of order $(\log T)/\Delta$ (up to $\log\log$ factors)
on the regret can be achieved with no information on the demand curve. Finally,
we show a $O(\sqrt{T})$ upper bound on the regret for the setting in which the

sales, is critical to advertisers for understanding the performance of their
existing marketing strategy as well as how to improve and optimize it. Media
Mix Modeling (MMM) has been used as a convenient analytical tool to address the

suffers from various fundamental challenges: data collection, model
specification and selection bias due to ad targeting, among others
\citep{chan2017,wolfe2016}.
  In this paper, we study the challenge associated with measuring the impact of
search ads in MMM, namely the selection bias due to ad targeting. Using causal
diagrams of the search ad environment, we derive a statistically principled
method for bias correction based on the \textit{back-door} criterion
\citep{pearl2013causality}. We use case studies to show that the method
provides promising results by comparison with results from randomized

spent on more than a dozen media channels but results from a randomized

that in some common, practical scenarios, one may be able to obtain an
approximately unbiased estimate of search ad ROAS.

information (CSI) is investigated to provide the required quality of service
(QoS) for all users. Taylor series approximation and semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) techniques are employed to reformulate the original non-convex power
minimization problem to a tractable one. Further, a fairness-based beamforming
approach is proposed through a max-min formulation to maintain fairness between
users. Next, we consider a robust scheme by incorporating channel
uncertainties, where the transmit power is minimized while satisfying the
outage probability requirement at each user. Through exploiting the SDR
approach, the original non-convex problem is reformulated in a linear matrix
inequality (LMI) form to obtain the optimal solution. Numerical results
demonstrate that the robust scheme can achieve better performance compared to
the non-robust scheme in terms of the rate satisfaction ratio. Further,
simulation results confirm that NOMA consumes a little over half transmit power
needed by OMA for the same data rate requirements. Hence, NOMA has the
potential to significantly improve the system performance in terms of transmit
power consumption in future 5G networks and beyond.

effective model that realizes the polarized metastable state as a solution,
spontaneously breaking the supersymmetry. The supersymmetric model relies
crucially on the inclusion of Kaluza-Klein (matrix) degrees of freedom on the

supersymmetry is realized nonlinearly. We comment on the effect of the

partly-convective stars that are believed to operate an interface dynamo, it is
poorly unconstrained in fully-convective stars that lack the necessary shear
layer between radiative core and the convective envelope. We present new X-ray
observations of 19 slowly-rotating fully-convective stars with rotation periods
from the MEarth Project. We use these to calculate X-ray luminosities (or upper
limits for undetected sources) and combine these with existing measurements
from \citet{wrig16b}. We confirm the existence of fully-convective stars in the
X-ray unsaturated regime and find that these objects follow the same
rotation-activity relationship seen for partly-convective stars. We measure the
power-law slope of the relationship between Rossby number (the ratio of the
rotation period to the convective turnover time) and the fractional X-ray
luminosity for X-ray unsaturated fully-convective stars for the first time, and
find it to be consistent with that found for partly-convective stars. We
discuss this implications of this result for our understanding of stellar

Using unbinned likelihood model fitting, we find that the inclusion of the

a sufficient velocity dispersion signal in the core so as to make an IMBH

between a pair of particles in a highly visual way. We set up an artificial

additional extra radiations occur. Notably, the new algorithm automatically
combines the information of the multi-point correlations in the jet.

However, the unpumped modes play a crucial role in the dynamics of the system
due to coherent back-scattering of photons. On a mean- field level we identify
three fundamentally different steady-state phases with distinct characteristics
in the density and spatial spin textures: a combined density and spin wave, a
continuous spin spiral with a homogeneous density, and a spin spiral with a
modulated density. The spin-spiral states, which are topological, are
intimately related to cavity-induced spin-orbit coupling emerging beyond a
critical pump power. The topologically trivial density-wave--spin-wave state
has the characteristics of a supersolid with two broken continuous symmetries.
The transitions between different phases are either simultaneously topological

for being the luminous sources that reionized our Universe. Next-generation
21cm surveys are promising to break degeneracies between a broad range of
reionization models, hence revealing the nature of the source population. While
many current efforts are focused on a measurement of the 21cm power spectrum,
some surveys will also image the 21cm field during reionization. This provides
further information with which to determine the nature of reionizing sources.
We create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is efficiently able to

thermal noise from typical 21cm experiments, the classification accuracy
depends strongly on the effectiveness of foreground removal. Our results show
that if foregrounds can be removed reasonably well, SKA, HERA and LOFAR should

""kilonova"") powered by the decay of freshly synthesized radioactive isotopes.
The luminosity of kilonova light curves depends on the efficiency with which
beta-decay electrons are thermalized in the ejecta. Here we derive a simple
analytic solution for thermalization by calculating how electrons accumulate in
the ejecta and lose energy adiabatically and via plasma losses. We find that
the time-dependent thermalization efficiency is well described by $f(t) \approx
(1 + t/t_e)^{-n}$ where $n \approx 1$ and the timescale $t_e$ is a function of
the ejecta mass and velocity. For a statistical distribution of r-process
isotopes with radioactive power $\dot{Q} \propto t^{-4/3}$, the late time
kilonova luminosity asymptotes to $L \propto t^{-7/3}$ and depends
super-linearly on the ejecta mass, $L \propto M^{5/3}$. If a kilonova is
instead powered by a single dominate isotope, we show that the late time
luminosity can deviate substantially from the underlying exponential decay and
eventually become brighter than the instantaneous radioactivity due to the
accumulation of trapped electrons. Applied to the kilonova associated with the
gravitational wave source GW170817, these results imply that a possible
steepening of the observed light curve at $\gtrsim 7$ days is unrelated to
thermalization effects and instead could mark the onset of translucency in a
high opacity component of ejecta. The analytic results should be convenient for
estimating the properties of observed kilonovae and assessing the potential
late time detectability of future events.

information processing because their violation can serve as a certificate of
relevant quantum properties. Probably the best known example of a Bell
inequality is due to Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH), which is defined
in the simplest scenario involving two dichotomic measurements and whose all
key properties are well understood. There have been many attempts to generalise
the CHSH Bell inequality to higher-dimensional quantum systems, however, for
most of them the maximal quantum violation---the key quantity for most
device-independent applications---remains unknown. On the other hand, the
constructions for which the maximal quantum violation can be computed, do not
preserve the natural property of the CHSH inequality, namely, that the maximal
quantum violation is achieved by the maximally entangled state and measurements
corresponding to mutually unbiased bases. In this work we propose a novel
family of Bell inequalities which exhibit precisely these properties, and whose
maximal quantum violation can be computed analytically. In the simplest
scenario it recovers the CHSH Bell inequality. These inequalities involve $d$
measurements settings, each having $d$ outcomes for an arbitrary prime number
$d\geq 3$. We then show that in the three-outcome case our Bell inequality can
be used to self-test the maximally entangled state of two-qutrits and three
mutually unbiased bases at each site. Yet, we demonstrate that in the case of
more outcomes, their maximal violation does not allow for self-testing in the
standard sense, which motivates the definition of a new weak form of
self-testing. The ability to certify high-dimensional MUBs makes these
inequalities attractive from the device-independent cryptography point of view.

turbulence is strongly dependent on the balance between shear-driven turbulence
production of horizontal fluctuations (driven by winds at the mesoscale), and
buoyancy-driven turbulence production of vertical velocity fluctuations (driven
by solar heating), characterized by the global instability state parameter
$-z_i/L > 0$. In the fully shear-driven neutral limit $-z_i/L \rightarrow 0$,
the surface layer is dominated by coherent streamwise-elongated concentrations
of negative streamwise fluctuating velocity (low-speed streaks), while in the
moderately convective state ($z_i/L \sim 10$ ) buoyancy generates
streamwise-elongated thermal updraft sheets of concentrated vertical velocity
fluctuations. Using large-eddy simulation (LES), we study the transition
between the neutral and moderately convective states by quantifying
correlations and integral scales as a function of $-z_i/L$ created by
systematically increasing surface heat flux with fixed geostrophic wind. We
discover a surprising sudden transition in ABL turbulence structure at $-z_i/L
\approx 0.40$ with dramatic enhancement of streamwise coherence, particularly
in the mixed layer, and a sudden change in ABL dynamic response to further
increase in surface heating. In the supercritical ABL, continued increase in
surface heat flux leads to a maximal coherence state at ($z_i/L \sim 1.0-1.5$)
associated with helical large-scale roll structure and exceptionally coherent
thermal updrafts, a process driven by two key dynamical effects: (a) a
surprising continual increase in streamwise coherence of streamwise velocity
fluctuations and shear-driven low-speed streaks and (b) increasing spatial
correlation between the coherent low-speed streaks in the surface layer below
and in the coherent thermal updrafts with in the mixed layer above.

  Networks: the role of Network Coding and Redundant Computing","Revised Version",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the problem of delay minimization in NFV-based
networks. In such systems, the ultimate goal of any request is to compute a
sequence of functions in the network, where each function can be computed at
only a specific subset of network nodes. In conventional approaches, for each
function, we choose one node from the corresponding subset of the nodes to
compute that function. In contrast, in this work, we allow each function to be
computed in more than one node, redundantly in parallel, to respond to a given
request. We argue that such redundancy in computation not only improves the
reliability of the network, but would also, perhaps surprisingly, reduce the
overall transmission delay. In particular, we establish that by judiciously
choosing the subset of nodes which compute each function, in conjunction with a
linear network coding scheme to deliver the result of each computation, we can
characterize and achieve the optimal end-to-end transmission delay. In
addition, we show that using such technique, we can significantly reduce the
transmission delay as compared to the conventional approach. In some scenarios,
such reduction can even scale with the size of the network. More precisely, by
increasing the number of nodes that can compute the given function in parallel
by a multiplicative factor, the end-to-end delay will also decrease by the same
factor. Moreover, we show that while finding the subset of nodes for each
computation, in general, is a complex integer program, approximation algorithms
can be proposed to reduce the computational complexity. In fact, for the case
where the number of computing nodes for a given function is upper-bounded by a
constant, a dynamic programming scheme can be proposed to find the optimum
subsets in polynomial times. Our numerical simulations confirm the achieved
gain in performance in comparison with conventional approaches.

solitons describing false vacuum decay in a prototypal Higgs-Yukawa theory. In
combination with appropriate counterterms for the masses, couplings and
wave-function normalization, these can be used to calculate radiative
corrections to the soliton solutions and transition rates that fully account
for the inhomogeneous background provided by the nucleated bubble. We apply
this approach to the archetypal example of transitions between the
quasi-degenerate vacua of a massive scalar field with a quartic
self-interaction. The effect of fermion loops is compared with those from
additional scalar fields, and the loop effects accounting for the spacetime
inhomogeneity of the tunneling configuration are compared with those where
gradients are neglected. We find that scalar loops lead to an enhancement of
the decay rate, whereas fermion loops lead to a suppression. These effects get
relatively amplified by a perturbatively small factor when gradients are
accounted for. In addition, we observe that the radiative corrections to the
solitonic field profiles are smoother when the gradients are included. The
method presented here for computing fermionic radiative corrections should be
applicable beyond the archetypal example of vacuum decay. In particular, we
work out methods that are suitable for calculations in the thin-wall limit, as
well as others that take account of the full spherical symmetry of the
solution. For the latter case, we construct the Green's functions based on spin
hyperspherical harmonics, which are eigenfunctions of the appropriate angular
momentum operators that commute with the Dirac operator in the solitonic
background.

and dissemination of knowledge about data-driven algorithms. In a given paper,
researchers might aspire to any subset of the following goals, among others: to
theoretically characterize what is learnable, to obtain understanding through
empirically rigorous experiments, or to build a working system that has high
predictive accuracy. While determining which knowledge warrants inquiry may be
subjective, once the topic is fixed, papers are most valuable to the community
when they act in service of the reader, creating foundational knowledge and
communicating as clearly as possible.
  Recent progress in machine learning comes despite frequent departures from
these ideals. In this paper, we focus on the following four patterns that
appear to us to be trending in ML scholarship: (i) failure to distinguish
between explanation and speculation; (ii) failure to identify the sources of
empirical gains, e.g., emphasizing unnecessary modifications to neural
architectures when gains actually stem from hyper-parameter tuning; (iii)
mathiness: the use of mathematics that obfuscates or impresses rather than
clarifies, e.g., by confusing technical and non-technical concepts; and (iv)
misuse of language, e.g., by choosing terms of art with colloquial connotations
or by overloading established technical terms.
  While the causes behind these patterns are uncertain, possibilities include
the rapid expansion of the community, the consequent thinness of the reviewer
pool, and the often-misaligned incentives between scholarship and short-term
measures of success (e.g., bibliometrics, attention, and entrepreneurial
opportunity). While each pattern offers a corresponding remedy (don't do it),
we also discuss some speculative suggestions for how the community might combat
these trends.

proposals in the same cluster are spatially adjacent and associated with the
same object. This prevents the network from concentrating too much on parts of
objects instead of whole objects. We first show that instances can be assigned
object or background labels directly based on proposal clusters for instance
classifier refinement, and then show that treating each cluster as a small new
bag yields fewer ambiguities than the directly assigning label method. The
iterative instance classifier refinement is implemented online using multiple
streams in convolutional neural networks, where the first is an MIL network and
the others are for instance classifier refinement supervised by the preceding
one. Experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC, ImageNet detection, and
MS-COCO benchmarks for WSOD. Results show that our method outperforms the
previous state of the art significantly.

works suggested methods for deciding the optimal autoencoder configuration

trained autoencoder has got limited, if no, attention. We propose a new
approach that improves the accuracy of a trained autoencoders results and
answers the following question, Given a trained autoencoder, a test image, and
using a real-parameter optimizer, can we generate better quality reconstructed
image version than the one generated by the autoencoder?. Our proposed approach
combines both the decoder part of a trained Resitricted Boltman Machine-based
autoencoder with the Competitive Swarm Optimization algorithm. Experiments show
that it is possible to reconstruct images using trained decoder from randomly
initialized representations. Results also show that our approach reconstructed
better quality images than the autoencoder in most of the test cases.
Indicating that, we can use the approach for improving the performance of a
pre-trained autoencoder if it does not give satisfactory results.

algorithm for SFBC signals identification over frequency-selective fading
channels to exploit two-dimensional space-frequency domain redundancy. Based on
the central limit theorem, space-domain redundancy is exploited to construct
the cross-correlation function of the estimator and frequency-domain redundancy
is incorporated in the construction of the statistics. The difference between
the two proposed algorithms is that the HT-based algorithm constructs a
chi-square statistic and employs an HT to make the decision, while the
SVM-based algorithm constructs a non-central chi-square statistic with unknown
mean as a strongly-distinguishable statistical feature and uses an SVM to make
the decision. Both algorithms do not require knowledge of the channel
coefficients, modulation type or noise power, and the SVM-based algorithm does
not require timing synchronization. Simulation results verify the superior
performance of the proposed algorithms for short observation periods with
comparable computational complexity to conventional algorithms, as well as
their acceptable identification performance in the presence of transmission
impairments.

correspondence. This work describes a method to infer voxel-level
transformation from higher-level correspondence information contained in
anatomical labels. We argue that such labels are more reliable and practical to
obtain for reference sets of image pairs than voxel-level correspondence.
Typical anatomical labels of interest may include solid organs, vessels, ducts,
structure boundaries and other subject-specific ad hoc landmarks. The proposed
end-to-end convolutional neural network approach aims to predict displacement
fields to align multiple labelled corresponding structures for individual image
pairs during the training, while only unlabelled image pairs are used as the
network input for inference. We highlight the versatility of the proposed
strategy, for training, utilising diverse types of anatomical labels, which
need not to be identifiable over all training image pairs. At inference, the
resulting 3D deformable image registration algorithm runs in real-time and is
fully-automated without requiring any anatomical labels or initialisation.
Several network architecture variants are compared for registering T2-weighted
magnetic resonance images and 3D transrectal ultrasound images from prostate
cancer patients. A median target registration error of 3.6 mm on landmark
centroids and a median Dice of 0.87 on prostate glands are achieved from

among a set of objects. Algorithms that compare graphs, and output a closeness
score, or a correspondence among their nodes, are thus extremely important.
Despite the large amount of work done, many of the scalable algorithms to
compare graphs do not produce closeness scores that satisfy the intuitive
properties of metrics. This is problematic since non-metrics are known to
degrade the performance of algorithms such as distance-based clustering of
graphs (Stratis and Bento 2018). On the other hand, the use of metrics
increases the performance of several machine learning tasks (Indyk et al. 1999,
Clarkson et al. 1999, Angiulli et al. 2002, Ackermann et al. 2010). In this
paper, we introduce a new family of multi-distances (a distance between more
than two elements) that satisfies a generalization of the properties of metrics
to multiple elements. In the context of comparing graphs, we are the first to
show the existence of multi-distances that simultaneously incorporate the
useful property of alignment consistency (Nguyen et al. 2011), and a
generalized metric property. Furthermore, we show that these multi-distances

shown its power for estimation of unknown functions. However, Gaussian
processes suffer from high computational complexity, as in a basic form they
scale cubically with the number of observations. Several approaches based on
inducing points were proposed to handle this problem in a static context. These
methods though face challenges with real-time tasks and when the data is
received sequentially over time. In this paper, a novel online algorithm for
training sparse Gaussian process models is presented. It treats the mean and
hyperparameters of the Gaussian process as the state and parameters of the
ensemble Kalman filter, respectively. The online evaluation of the parameters
and the state is performed on new upcoming samples of data. This procedure
iteratively improves the accuracy of parameter estimates. The ensemble Kalman
filter reduces the computational complexity required to obtain predictions with
Gaussian processes preserving the accuracy level of these predictions. The
performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on the synthetic dataset and
real large dataset of UK house prices.

downwards to be no more top-heavy than roughly equal mass per log size, a
significant deviation from the distribution observed between 1e-5 and 1e-3

of this work is to measure the cold gas reservoir of three highly obscured QSOs
to test if their gas fraction is similar to that of sub-millimeter galaxies
(SMGs), as expected by some models, and place these measurements in the context
of the SB-QSO framework. We target CO(1-0) transition in BzK4892, a Compton
Thick (CT) QSO at z=2.6, CO(1-0) in BzK8608 and CO(2-1) in CDF153, two highly
obscured QSOs at z=2.5 and z=1.5, respectively. For all these targets, we place
3$\sigma$ upper limits on the CO, with $L'_{CO} < (1.5\div 2.8)\times 10^{10}$
K km/s pc$^2$. We also compare the molecular gas conditions of our targets with
those of other systems at z>1, considering normal star forming galaxies and
SMGs, unobscured and obscured AGN from the literature. For the AGN samples, we
provide an updated and (almost) complete collection of targets with CO
follow-up. BzK4892 displays a high star formation efficiency
(SFE$=L_{IR}/L'_{CO}>410$ L$_{\odot}$/(K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)) and a gas
fraction $f_{gas}<0.1$. Less stringent constraints are derived for the other
two targets ($f_{gas}<0.5$ and SFE$>10$). From the comparison with literature
data, we found that a) obscured AGN at z>1 are associated with higher SFE and
lower $f_{gas}$ with respect to star forming galaxies; b) mildly and highly
obscured active galaxies have comparable gas fractions; c) the SFE of CT and
obscured AGN are similar to those of unobscured AGN. Within the SB-QSO
framework, these findings could be consistent with a scenario where feedback
can impact the host galaxy already from the early phases of the SB-QSO

situations where this context is partially observed, and the unobserved part
comes after some delay. We assume that an agent, once left, cannot re-enter the
system. Therefore, the job of the system is to provide an estimated score for
the agent based on her instantaneous score and possibly some inference of the
instantaneous score over the delayed score. In this paper, we estimate the
delayed context via an online convex game between the agent and the system. We
argue that the error in the score estimate accumulated over $T$ iterations is
small if the regret of the online convex game is small. Further, we leverage
side information about the delayed context in the form of a correlation
function with the known context. We consider the settings where the delay is
fixed or arbitrarily chosen by an adversary. Furthermore, we extend the
formulation to the setting where the contexts are drawn from some Banach space.
Overall, we show that the average penalty for not knowing the delayed context

environmentally driven quenching among star-forming galaxies in nearby galaxy
groups and clusters. Quenching is linked with environment and stellar mass, and
much of the current observational evidence comes from the integrated properties
of galaxies. However, the relative size of the stellar and star-forming disk is
sensitive to environmental processing and can help identify the mechanisms that
lead to a large fraction of quenched galaxies in dense environments. Toward
this end, we measure the size of the star-forming disks for 224 galaxies in
nine groups and clusters (0.02<z<0.04; SFR > 0.1 M$_\odot$/yr) using 24um
imaging from the Spitzer Space Telescope. We normalize the 24um effective
radius (R24) by the size of the stellar disk (Rd). We find that star-forming
galaxies with higher bulge-to-total ratios (B/T) and galaxies in more dense
environments have more centrally concentrated star formation. Comparison with
H~I mass fractions and NUV-r colors indicates that a galaxy's transition from
gas-rich and blue to depleted and red is accompanied by an increase in the
central concentration of star formation. We build a simple model to constrain
the timescale over which the star-forming disks shrink in the cluster
environment. Our results are consistent with a long-timescale (>2Gyr) mechanism
that produces outside-in quenching, such as the removal of the extended gas
halo or weak stripping of the cold disk gas.

  Combinatorial Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An important challenge in reinforcement learning, including evolutionary
robotics, is to solve multimodal problems, where agents have to act in
qualitatively different ways depending on the circumstances. Because multimodal
problems are often too difficult to solve directly, it is helpful to take
advantage of staging, where a difficult task is divided into simpler subtasks
that can serve as stepping stones for solving the overall problem.
Unfortunately, choosing an effective ordering for these subtasks is difficult,
and a poor ordering can reduce the speed and performance of the learning
process. Here, we provide a thorough introduction and investigation of the
Combinatorial Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (CMOEA), which avoids
ordering subtasks by allowing all combinations of subtasks to be explored
simultaneously. We compare CMOEA against two algorithms that can similarly
optimize on multiple subtasks simultaneously: NSGA-II and Lexicase Selection.
The algorithms are tested on a multimodal robotics problem with six subtasks as
well as a maze navigation problem with a hundred subtasks. On these problems,
CMOEA either outperforms or is competitive with the controls. Separately, we
show that adding a linear combination over all objectives can improve the
ability of NSGA-II to solve these multimodal problems. Lastly, we show that, in
contrast to NSGA-II and Lexicase Selection, CMOEA can effectively leverage
secondary objectives to achieve state-of-the-art results on the robotics task.
In general, our experiments suggest that CMOEA is a promising, state-of-the-art
algorithm for solving multimodal problems.

is involved for the transport of nutrients. At the water/biofilm interface,
nutrient transport and shear forces due to the water flux are considered. In
the biofilm, the Brinkman equation for the water flow, transport of nutrients
due to diffusion and convection, displacement of the biofilm components due to

segregated finite element algorithm is used to solve the mathematical
equations. Numerical simulations are performed based on experimentally

police shootings get more and more public attention (police killing detection).
Unfortunately, there has been not much work in the literature addressing this
problem. The early work in this field \cite{keith2017identifying} proposed a
distant supervision framework based on Expectation Maximization (EM) to deal
with the multiple appearances of the names in documents. However, such EM-based
framework cannot take full advantages of deep learning models, necessitating
the use of hand-designed features to improve the detection performance. In this
work, we present a novel deep learning method to solve the problem of police
killing recognition. The proposed method relies on hierarchical LSTMs to model
the multiple sentences that contain the person names of interests, and
introduce supervised attention mechanisms based on semantical word lists and
dependency trees to upweight the important contextual words. Our experiments
demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model and yield the state-of-the-art
performance for police killing detection.

graphon dynamical system models are formulated in an appropriate infinite
dimensional space in order to represent arbitrary-size networks of linear
dynamical systems, and to define the convergence of sequences of network
systems with limits in the space. Exact controllability and approximate
controllability of graphon dynamical systems are then investigated. Second, the
minimum energy state-to-state control problem and the linear quadratic
regulator problem for systems on complex networks are considered. The control
problem for graphon limit systems is solved in each case and approximations are
defined which yield control laws for the original control problems.
Furthermore, convergence properties of the approximation schemes are
established. A systematic control design methodology is developed within this
framework. Finally, numerical examples of networks with randomly sampled
weightings are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the graphon control

electromagnetic response in the superconducting states. Both superfluid and

only when the excited superconducting velocity $v_s$ is larger than a threshold
$v_L=|\Delta|/k_F$. Interestingly, with the normal fluid, we find that there
exists friction between the normal-fluid and superfluid currents. Due to this
friction, part of the superfluid becomes viscous. Therefore, a three-fluid
model: normal fluid, non-viscous and viscous superfluids, is proposed. For the
stationary magnetic response, at $v_s<v_L$ with only the non-viscous
superfluid, the Meissner supercurrent is excited and the gap equation can
reduce to Ginzburg-Landau equation. At $v_s{\ge}v_L$, with the normal fluid,
non-viscous and viscous superfluids, in addition to the directly excited
Meissner supercurrent in the superfluid, normal-fluid current is also induced
through the friction drag with the viscous superfluid current. Due to the
normal-fluid and viscous superfluid currents, the penetration depth is
influenced by the scattering effect. In addition, a modified Ginzburg-Landau
equation is proposed. We predict an exotic phase in which both the resistivity
and superconducting gap are {\em finite}. As for the optical response, the
excited ${v_s}$ oscillates with time. When $v_s<v_L$, only the non-viscous
superfluid is present whereas at $v_s{\ge}v_L$, normal fluid, non-viscous and
viscous superfluids are present. We show that the excited normal-fluid current
exhibits the Drude-model behavior while the superfluid current consists of the
Meissner supercurrent and Bogoliubov quasiparticle current. Due to the friction

captured by the three-fluid model. ......

the elliptic cylinder is kept perpendicular to the incoming flow, where the
fluid flow is two-dimensional and the Prandtl number is 0.71. The scalar is
injected into the flow field by means of heating the cylinder continuously. The
simulation is run for a long time to show that the secondary vortex street is a
time-dependent phenomenon. Three distinguishable flow and scalar regions are
observed in the wake of the cylinder. This study reveals the presence of
low-frequency structures besides the primary shedding structures in linear,
transition and saturation regions of temporal wake development. We show that
the spectral source of the primary frequency is the saturated state of the
temporal wake development, while its physical source is the periodic
arrangement of structures of primitive variables, which inhibits the
transmutation of their wavelength. On the other hand, the secondary low
frequency is embedded in the transitional developing stage of the wake and its
physical source is the chaotic behaviour of the transition process, which aids
in the transmutation of the wavelength of the structures. Our spectral analysis
also reveals that the scalar is predominately carried by the streamwise
velocity and the pressure throughout the wake.

modulation is much less than the relevant scattering lengths (mean free path,
coherence length etc.). Our work experimentally demonstrates the opposite,
disordered limit of such system, defined in the macroscopically modulated
metal-oxide-semiconductor structure. The system consists of parent
two-dimensional gas with periodic array of islands (dots/antidots), filled with
two-dimensional gas of different density, and surrounded by depletion regions
(shells). Carrier densities of both parent gas and islands are controlled by
two independent gate electrodes, allowing us to explore a rich phase diagram of
low-temperature transport properties of this modulated two-dimensional system,
resembling various transport regimes: insulating, shell-dominated,
gas-dominated, island-dominated. These regimes can be identified by various
Hall resistance and its magnetic field dependence, temperature dependencies of
the resistivity, and Shubnikov-de Haas patterns. We also suggest the
theoretical approach for description of such inhomogeneous but periodical
systems. Theory based on the classical mean field approach qualitatively
describes our system as theoretical dependencies reproduce the main features of
the experimental behavior of the effective Hall concentration from gate

functions. We notice, however, that previous mass estimates are subject to
large systematic uncertainties because most of the relative abundances (X/Si)

rely only on the Fe/Si ratio which is sensitive to the CO core mass ($M_{\rm

solving particle acceleration problem associated with magnetic reconnection is
the enormous scale separation between kinetic scales and observed reconnection
scale. Because of this, it has been difficult to draw any definite conclusions
by just using kinetic simulations. Particle acceleration model that solves
energetic particle transport equation can capture the main acceleration physics
found in kinetic simulations, and thus provide a practical way to make
observable predictions and directly compare model results with observations.
Here we study compression particle acceleration in magnetic reconnection by
solving Parker (diffusion-advection) transport equation using velocity and
magnetic fields from two-dimensional high-Lundquist-number magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) simulations of a low-$\beta$ reconnection layer. We show that the
compressible reconnection layer can give significant particle acceleration,
leading to the formation of power-law particle energy distributions. We analyze
the acceleration rate and find that the acceleration in the reconnection layer
is a mixture of first order and second order Fermi processes. When including a
guide field, we find the spectrum becomes steeper and both the power-law cutoff
energy and maximum particle energy decrease as plasma becomes less
compressible. This model produces 2D particle distribution that one can use to
generate radiation map and directly compare with solar flare observations. This
provides a framework to explain particle acceleration at large-scale
astrophysical reconnection sites, such as solar flares.

Au side near the interface flows in the opposite direction to the bulk spin
Hall current with the magnitude sensitive to the magnetization direction of Fe.
This negative interfacial contribution is attributed to the spin dependent
transmission within a few atomic layers, where a strong interfacial Rashba
spin-orbit coupling exists. Surprisingly, the interfacial spin Hall currents
are found to be not confined at the interface but extend tens of nanometers at
low temperature, which is limited by momentum scattering and therefore much
shorter than the spin diffusion length. In addition, the interfacial swapping
spin currents, as a consequence of the spin precession under the interfacial
Rashba field, are also obtained from our calculation and complete the full spin

large-scale network traffic flows, where the nodes and the edges can be defined
to represent different flow levels and flow interactions separately. Then, the
statistical characteristics and dynamic behaviors of the TLCNs are studied to
represent TLCN's structure representing ability to the flow interactions.
According to the analysis of TLCN statistical characteristics with different

the small-world TLCN and the strong interaction flows prefer to the scale-free
TLCN. In the studies of anomaly behaviors of TLCNs, the network structure of

transition for the Kerr-AdS black hole. The coexistence curve and the
metastable curve corresponding to the phase transition are clearly shown. On
the other side, we calculate the radius and the angular momentum of the
unstable circular orbits for a photon by analyzing the effective potential.
Then combining these two sides, we find the following results. i) The radius
and the angular momentum of the unstable circular photon orbits demonstrate the
non-monotonic behaviors when the thermodynamic phase transition takes place. So
from the behavior of the circular orbit, one can determine whether there exists
a thermodynamic phase transition. ii) The difference of the radius or the
angular momentum for the coexistence small and large black holes can be treated
as an order parameter to describe the phase transition. And near the critical
point, it has a critical exponent of $\frac{1}{2}$. iii) The temperature and
pressure corresponding to the extremal points of the radius or the angular
momentum of the unstable circular photon orbit completely agree with that of
the metastable curves from the thermodynamic side. Thus, these results confirm
the relationship between the geodesics and thermodynamic phase transition for

the United States experiences hundreds of tornadoes with associated damages on
the order of one billion dollars. Community preparation and resilience would
benefit from accurate predictions of these economic losses, particularly as
populations in tornado-prone areas increase in density and extent. Here, we use
a zero-inflated modeling approach and artificial neural networks to predict
tornado-induced property damage using publicly available data. We developed a
neural network that predicts whether a tornado will cause property damage
(out-of-sample accuracy = 0.821 and area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve, AUROC, = 0.872). Conditional on a tornado causing damage,
another neural network predicts the amount of damage (out-of-sample mean
squared error = 0.0918 and R2 = 0.432). When used together, these two models
function as a zero-inflated log-normal regression with hidden layers. From the
best-performing models, we provide static and interactive gridded maps of
monthly predicted probabilities of damage and property damages for the year
2019. Two primary weaknesses include (1) model fitting requires log-scale data
which leads to large natural-scale residuals and (2) beginning tornado
coordinates were utilized rather than tornado paths. Ultimately, this is the
first known study to directly model tornado-induced property damages, and all
data, code, and tools are publicly available. The predictive capacity of this

transverse resolution. Laser-processed crystals can also potentially increase

The stochastic block model (SBM) is a widely used model, for which various
estimation methods have been developed with their community detection
consistency results unveiled. However, the SBM is restricted by the strong
assumption that all nodes in the same community are stochastically equivalent,
which may not be suitable for practical applications. We introduce a pairwise
covariates-adjusted stochastic block model (PCABM), a generalization of SBM
that incorporates pairwise covariate information. We study the maximum
likelihood estimates of the coefficients for the covariates as well as the
community assignments. It is shown that both the coefficient estimates of the
covariates and the community assignments are consistent under suitable sparsity
conditions. Spectral clustering with adjustment (SCWA) is introduced to
efficiently solve PCABM. Under certain conditions, we derive the error bound of
community detection under SCWA and show that it is community detection
consistent. In addition, we investigate model selection in terms of the number
of communities and feature selection for the pairwise covariates, and propose
two corresponding algorithms. PCABM compares favorably with the SBM or
degree-corrected stochastic block model (DCBM) under a wide range of simulated
and real networks when covariate information is accessible.

  Compression with Multiple Bits-Per-Pixel Rates","13 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lossy image compression (LIC), which aims to utilize inexact approximations
to represent an image more compactly, is a classical problem in image
processing. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved
interesting results in LIC by learning an encoder-quantizer-decoder network
from a large amount of data. However, existing CNN-based LIC methods usually
can only train a network for a specific bits-per-pixel (bpp). Such a ""one
network per bpp"" problem limits the generality and flexibility of CNNs to
practical LIC applications. In this paper, we propose to learn a single CNN
which can perform LIC at multiple bpp rates. A simple yet effective Tucker
Decomposition Network (TDNet) is developed, where there is a novel tucker
decomposition layer (TDL) to decompose a latent image representation into a set
of projection matrices and a core tensor. By changing the rank of the core
tensor and its quantization, we can easily adjust the bpp rate of latent image
representation within a single CNN. Furthermore, an iterative non-uniform
quantization scheme is presented to optimize the quantizer, and a
coarse-to-fine training strategy is introduced to reconstruct the decompressed
images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art compression
performance of TDNet in terms of both PSNR and MS-SSIM indices.

systems defined on manifolds. The idea is to embed the state-space manifold $M$
of a given control system into some Euclidean space $\mathbb R^n$, extend the
system from $M$ to the ambient space $\mathbb R^n$, and modify it outside $M$
to add transversal stability to $M$ in the final dynamics in $\mathbb R^n$.
Controllers are designed for the final system in the ambient space $\mathbb
R^n$. Then, their restriction to $M$ produces controllers for the original
system on $M$. This method has the merit that only one single global Cartesian
coordinate system in the ambient space $\mathbb R^n$ is used for controller
synthesis, and any controller design method in $\mathbb R^n$, such as the
linearization method, can be globally applied for the controller synthesis. The
proposed method is successfully applied to the tracking problem for the
following two benchmark systems: the fully actuated rigid body system and the
quadcopter drone system.

classification, plane curves are represented as points in an
infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, wherein shape dissimilarity is
measured by geodesic distance. A remarkable result of Younes, Michor, Shah and
Mumford says that the space of closed planar shapes, endowed with a natural
metric, is isometric to an infinite-dimensional Grassmann manifold via the
so-called square root transform. This result facilitates efficient shape
comparison by virtue of explicit descriptions of Grassmannian geodesics. In
this paper, we extend this shape analysis framework to treat shapes of framed
space curves. By considering framed curves, we are able to generalize the
square root transform by using quaternionic arithmetic and properties of the
Hopf fibration. Under our coordinate transformation, the space of closed framed
curves corresponds to an infinite-dimensional complex Grassmannian. This allows
us to describe geodesics in framed curve space explicitly. We are also able to
produce explicit geodesics between closed, unframed space curves by studying
the action of the loop group of the circle on the Grassmann manifold. Averages
of collections of plane and space curves are computed via a novel algorithm

model of artificial neural network for unsupervised learning. Recently, RBM is
well known to be a pre-training method of Deep Learning. In addition to visible
and hidden neurons, the structure of RBM has a number of parameters such as the
weights between neurons and the coefficients for them. Therefore, we may meet
some difficulties to determine an optimal network structure to analyze big
data. In order to evade the problem, we investigated the variance of parameters
to find an optimal structure during learning. For the reason, we should check
the variance of parameters to cause the fluctuation for energy function in RBM
model. In this paper, we propose the adaptive learning method of RBM that can
discover an optimal number of hidden neurons according to the training
situation by applying the neuron generation and annihilation algorithm. In this
method, a new hidden neuron is generated if the energy function is not still
converged and the variance of the parameters is large. Moreover, the
inactivated hidden neuron will be annihilated if the neuron does not affect the
learning situation. The experimental results for some benchmark data sets were
discussed in this paper.

arising in earlier studies of network analysis. There are several equivalent
definitions of graph reassembling; in this report we use a definition which
makes it closest to the notion of graph carving. A reassembling is a rooted
binary tree whose nodes are subsets of V and whose leaf nodes are singleton
sets, with each of the latter containing a distinct vertex of G. The parent of
two nodes in the reassembling is the union of the two children's vertex sets.
The root node of the reassembling is the full set V. The edge-boundary degree
of a node in the reassembling is the number of edges in G that connect vertices
in the node's set to vertices not in the node's set. A reassembling's
alpha-measure is the largest edge-boundary degree of any node in the
reassembling. A reassembling of G is alpha-optimal if its alpha-measure is the
minimum among all alpha-measures of G's reassemblings.
  The problem of finding an alpha-optimal reassembling of a simple graph in
general was already shown to be NP-hard.
  In this report we present an algorithm which, given a 3-regular plane graph G
= (V,E) as input, returns a reassembling of G with an alpha-measure independent
of n (number of vertices in G) and upper-bounded by 2k, where k is the
edge-outerplanarity of G. (Edge-outerplanarity is distinct but closely related
to the usual notion of outerplanarity; as with outerplanarity, for a fixed
edge-outerplanarity k, the number n of vertices can be arbitrarily large.) Our
algorithm runs in time linear in n. Moreover, we construct a class of
$3$-regular plane graphs for which this alpha-measure is optimal, by proving
that 2k is the lower bound on the alpha-measure of any reassembling of a graph
in that class.

gravitational wave detectors to cellular telephones. They serve as
high-performance transducers, sensors, and filters by offering low dissipation,
tunable coupling to diverse physical systems, and compatibility with a wide
range of frequencies, materials, and fabrication processes. Systems of phononic
resonators typically obey reciprocity, which ensures that the phonon
transmission coefficient between any two resonators is independent of the
direction of transmission. Reciprocity must be broken to realize devices (such
as isolators and circulators) that provide one-way propagation of acoustic
energy between resonators. Such devices are crucial for protecting active
elements, mitigating noise, and operating full-duplex transceivers. To date,
nonreciprocal phononic devices have not combined the features necessary for
robust operation: strong nonreciprocity, in situ tunability, compact
integration, and continuous operation. Furthermore, they have been applied only
to coherent signals (rather than fluctuations or noise), and have been realized
exclusively in travelling-wave systems (rather than resonators). Here we
describe a cavity optomechanical scheme that produces robust nonreciprocal
coupling between phononic resonators. This scheme provides ~ 30 dB of isolation
and can be tuned in situ simply via the phases of the drive tones applied to
the cavity. In addition, by directly monitoring the resonators' dynamics we
show that this nonreciprocity can be used to control thermal fluctuations, and
that this control represents a new resource for cooling phononic resonators.

numerical method widely used for accurately and efficiently solving flow
problems with free surface effects. However, to date there has been little
mathematical investigation of properties such as stability or convergence for
this method. In this paper, unique solvability and stability are mathematically
analyzed for implicit and semi-implicit schemes in the ISPH method. Three key
conditions for unique solvability and stability are introduced: a connectivity
condition with respect to particle distribution and smoothing length, a
regularity condition for particle distribution, and a time step condition. The
unique solvability of both the implicit and semi-implicit schemes in two- and
three-dimensional spaces is established with the connectivity condition. The
stability of the implicit scheme in two-dimensional space is established with
the connectivity and regularity conditions. Moreover, with the addition of the
time step condition, the stability of the semi-implicit scheme in
two-dimensional space is established. As an application of these results,
modified schemes are developed by redefining discrete parameters to
automatically satisfy parts of these conditions.

final core mass, are not significantly altered as a result of the change of
atmospheric treatment. During the course of the investigation, a previously
unseen phenomena in the AGB models was observed and further investigated. This

the formation of multiple populations. So far, the dynamics of multiple
populations have been investigated either from radial velocities of a
relatively-small sample of stars, or from relative proper motions of stars in
the small field of view provided by the Hubble Space Telescope. In this
context, Gaia provides the unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of
thousands GC stars over a wide field of view. For the first time, we combine
Gaia DR2 proper motions and multi-band photometry to study the internal motions
of the two main stellar populations of 47 Tucanae in a wide field of view. We
confirm that this cluster exhibits high rotation on the plane of the sky and
find that both stellar generations share similar rotation patters.
Second-generation stars show stronger anisotropies and smaller
tangential-velocity dispersion than the first generation, while there is no
significant difference between their radial-velocity dispersion profiles. We

We formulate the theory of thermal noise within second-order viscous

(1+1)-dimension hydrodynamic evolution. The code is tested to reproduce the
analytic results for the Riemann solver for expansion of matter in vacuum. For
viscous hydrodynamic expansion, the initial energy density distribution are
obtained by reproducing the measured charged hadron rapidity distribution at
the RHIC energies. We show that the longitudinal rapidity correlations arising
from space-time dependent thermal noise and from an induced thermal
perturbation have distinct structures. In general, the rapidity correlations
are found to be dominated by temperature fluctuations at small rapidity
separation and velocity fluctuations at large rapidities. We demonstrate that
thermal noise produce ridge-like two-particle rapidity correlations which
persist at moderately large rapidities. The magnitude and pattern of the
correlations are quite sensitive to various second-order dissipative formalisms
and to the underlying equations of state, especially at large rapidities. The
short-range part of the rapidity correlation is found to be somewhat enhanced

structural distortion that breaks the symmetry between formerly equivalent Ni

this issue by simultaneously taking into account both structural and electronic
degrees of freedom using a charge self-consistent combination of density
functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory, together with screened
interaction parameters obtained from the constrained random phase
approximation. Our total energy calculations show that the coupling to an
electronic instability towards a charge disproportionated insulating state is
crucial to stabilize the structural distortion, leading to a clear first order
character of the coupled transition. The decreasing octahedral rotations across
the series suppress this electronic instability and simultaneously increase the
screening of the effective Coulomb interaction, thus weakening the correlation
effects responsible for the metal-insulator transition. Our approach allows to
obtain accurate values for the structural distortion and thus facilitates a
comprehensive understanding, both qualitatively and quantitatively, of the
complex interplay between structural properties and electronic correlation
effects across the nickelate series.

popular due to its practical simplicity. However, the severe nonlinearity and
non-convexity make the related optimization problem mathematically difficult to
solve, especially when the transmit power or the path-loss exponent (PLE) is
unknown. Moreover, even if the PLE is known but not perfectly estimated or the
anchor location information is not accurate, the constructed data model will
become uncertain, making the problem again hard to solve. This paper
particularly focuses on differential received signal strength (DRSS)-based
localization with model uncertainties in case of unknown transmit power and
PLE. A new whitened model for DRSS-based localization with unknown transmit
powers is first presented and investigated. When assuming the PLE is known, we
introduce two estimators based on an exact data model, an advanced best linear
unbiased estimator (A-BLUE) and a Lagrangian estimator (LE), and then we
present a robust semidefinite programming (SDP)-based estimator (RSDPE), which
can cope with model uncertainties (imperfect PLE and inaccurate anchor location
information). The three proposed estimators have their own advantages from
different perspectives: the A-BLUE has the lowest complexity; the LE holds the
best accuracy for a small measurement noise; and the RSDPE yields the best
performance under a large measurement noise and possesses a very good
robustness against model uncertainties. Finally, we propose a robust SDP-based
block coordinate descent estimator (RSDP-BCDE) to deal with a completely
unknown PLE and its performance converges to that of the RSDPE using a
perfectly known PLE.

fact that traffic traces are often characterized by arrival processes that
display a decreasing, but non-negligible, probability of observing a request as
the time elapsed since the last request increases. An optimization-based
analysis of soft-TTL is presented, demonstrating the important role played by

limited training data effectively. At the same time, the repeated sampling of
text 'subsections' improves the consistency of the predicted text feature maps
which is critical in predicting a single complete instead of multiple broken
boxes for long words or text lines. In addition, a semantics-aware text border
detection technique is designed which produces four types of text border
segments for each scene text. With semantics-aware text borders, scene texts
can be localized more accurately by regressing text pixels around the ends of
words or text lines instead of all text pixels which often leads to inaccurate
localization while dealing with long words or text lines. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, and superior

massive MIMO precoding should be designed when the digital-to-analog conversion
at the transmitter side is operated by cheap one-bit digital-to-analog
converters (DACs). Such research is motivated by the desire to substantially
cut down the hardware cost and power consumption of the radio-frequency chain,
which is unaffordable in massive MIMO if high-resolution DACs are still used.
One-bit MIMO precoding design problems are much harder to solve than their
high-resolution DAC counterparts. In our previous work, we developed a minimum
symbol-error probability (SEP) design for one-bit precoding under the multiuser
MISO downlink scenario and under quadrature amplitude modulation signaling.
Leveraging on the previous work, this work shows how the minimum SEP design is
applied to M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) signaling. Simulation results show
that our minimum SEP design delivers significantly better bit-error rate (BER)
performance than the other designs for higher-order PSK such as 8-PSK and
16-PSK. As a minor, but useful, side contribution, we also tackle an MPSK SEP
characterization problem which was only intuitively treated in the prior arts.

viscosity and the Green-Kubo stress correlation function from the microscopic
perspective. In most of these and earlier works the atomic level stress is the
minimal element of stress. It is also possible to consider, for pairwise
interaction potentials, as the minimal elements of stress, the stress tensors
associated with the pairs of interacting particles. From this perspective, the
atomic level stress is not the minimal stress element, but a sum of all pair
stress elements in which involved a selected particle. In this paper, we
consider the Green-Kubo stress correlation function from a microscopic
perspective using the stress tensors of interacting pairs as the basic stress
elements. The obtained results show the presence of a long-range
bond-orientational order in the studied model liquid and naturally elucidate
the connection of the bond-orientational order with viscosity. It turns out
that the long-range bond-orientational order is more clearly expressed in the
pairs' stress correlation function than in the atomic stress correlation
function. On the other hand, previously observed stress waves are much better
expressed in the atomic stress correlation functions. We also address the close
connection of our approach with the previous bond-orientational order
considerations. Finally, we consider the probability distributions for the
bond-stress and atomic stress correlation products at selected distances. The
character of the obtained probability distributions raises questions about the
meaning of the average correlation functions at large distances.

we detect wavelength-dependent microlensing, which we use to place constraints
on the sizes and temperature profiles of the accretion discs in each quasar.
Accretion disc radius is assumed to vary with wavelength according to the
power-law relationship $r\propto \lambda^p$, equivalent to a radial temperature
profile of $T\propto r^{-1/p}$. The goal of this work is to search for
deviations from standard thin disc theory, which predicts that radius goes as
wavelength to the power $p=4/3$. We find a wide range of power-law indices,
from $p=1.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ in B 1422+231 to $p=2.3^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ in WFI
J2026-4536. The measured value of $p$ appears to correlate with the strength of
the wavelength-dependent microlensing. We explore this issue with mock
simulations using a fixed accretion disc with $p=1.5$, and find that cases
where wavelength-dependent microlensing is small tend to under-estimate the
value of $p$. This casts doubt on previous ensemble single-epoch measurements
which have favoured low values using samples of lensed quasars that display
only moderate chromatic effects. Using only our systems with strong chromatic
microlensing we prefer $p>4/3$, corresponding to shallower temperature profiles
than expected from standard thin disc theory.

require positive semi-definite kernels. These kernels may be based on distance
functions. While definiteness is proven for common distances and kernels, a
proof for a new kernel may require too much time and effort for users who
simply aim at practical usage. Furthermore, designing definite distances or
kernels may be equally intricate. Finally, models can be enabled to use
indefinite kernels. This may deteriorate the accuracy or computational cost of
the model. Hence, an efficient method to determine definiteness is required. We
propose an empirical approach. We show that sampling as well as optimization
with an evolutionary algorithm may be employed to determine definiteness. We
provide a proof-of-concept with 16 different distance measures for
permutations. Our approach allows to disprove definiteness if a respective
counter-example is found. It can also provide an estimate of how likely it is

observation-ray based objective function. With this modification, the problem
formulation faithfully mimics the projective nature in a camera's image
formation, BA is able to achieve better convergence, accuracy and robustness.
This is particularly useful in handling diverse outdoor environments and
collinear motion modes. Capitalizing on these properties, we further propose a
pose-graph simplification to PMBA, with significant dimensionality reduction.
This pose-graph model is convex in nature, easy to solve and its solution can
serve as a good initial guess to the original BA problem which is intrinsically
non-convex. We provide theoretical proof that our global initialization
strategy can guarantee a near-optimal solution. Using a series of experiments
involving diverse environmental conditions and motions, we demonstrate PMBA's
superior convergence performance in comparison to other BA methods. We also
show that, without incremental initialization or via third-party information,
our global initialization process helps to bootstrap the full BA successfully

presented. The underlying covariant canonical transformation framework invokes
a dynamical space-time Hamiltonian consisting of the Einstein-Hilbert term plus
a quadratic Riemann tensor invariant with a fundamental dimensionless coupling
constant $g_1$. A typical time scale related to this constant, $\tau = \sqrt{8
\pi G g_1}$, is characteristic for the type of cosmological solutions: for $t
\ll \tau$ the quadratic term is dominant, the energy-momentum tensor of the
matter is not covariantly conserved, and we observe modified dynamics of matter
and space-time. On the other hand, for $t \gg \tau$, the Einstein term
dominates and the solution converges to classical cosmology. This is analyzed
for different types of matter and dark energy with a constant equation of
state. While for a radiation dominated universe solution the cosmology does not
change, we find for a dark energy universe the well known de-Sitter space.
However, we also identify a special bouncing solution (for $k=0$) which for
large times approaches the de-Sitter space again. For a dust dominated universe
(with no pressure) deviations are seen only in the early epoch. In the late
epoch, the solution asymptotically behaves like the standard dust solution.

dimensions, which is the archetypal problem in combinatorial optimization, in
the bipartite case, is simply related to the average cost of the assignment
problem with the same Euclidean, increasing, convex weights. In this way we
extend a result already known in one dimension where exact solutions are
avalaible. The recently determined average cost for the assignment when the
cost function is the square of the distance between the points provides
therefore an exact prediction $$\overline{E_N} = \frac{1}{\pi}\, \log N$$ for
large number of points $2N$. As a byproduct of our analysis also the loop
covering problem has the same optimal average cost. We also explain why this
result cannot be extended at higher dimensions. We numerically check the exact
predictions.

material on mass ablation, energy and magnetic flux losses are studied in a
MagLIF fusion-like plasma. The analysis performed in [Garc\'ia-Rubio and Sanz,
Phys. Plasmas 24, 072710 (2017)] is extended to liner materials of an arbitrary
atomic number. The liner ablates and penetrates into the hot spot, compressing
and cooling down the fuel. The magnetic flux in the fuel is lost by Nernst
convection through the ablated liner - fuel interface, called ablated border.
Increasing the liner atomic number leads to a reduction of both energy and
magnetic flux losses in the fuel for a small and moderate magnetization values.
Mass diffusion is confined within a thin layer at the ablated border.
Concentration gradient and baro-diffusion are the predominant mechanisms
leading to liner - fuel mixing. The width of the diffusion layer may be
comparable to the turbulent mixing layer resulting from the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability at the ablated border. An asymptotic analysis performed for large
liner atomic number Z_{2} shows that mass ablation, energy and magnetic flux
losses and liner - fuel mass diffusion scale as 1/\sqrt{Z_{2}}.

temperature-dependent functions. Different configurations of the channel,

the upper and lower surfaces of the channel is kept constant during the
simulations. It is observed that utilizing these configurations can boost the
heat transfer up to 277.9% and amplify the pressure loss up to 179.4% with a

channels with pyramidal protrusions is improved by 12.0-169.4% compared to the
plain channel for the conditions studied here. Furthermore, the thermodynamic
performance of the channel is investigated in terms of entropy generation and
it is found that equipping the channels with pyramidal protrusions leads to

stochastic blockmodel, which defines the link probability between any pair of

using a nonparametric Bayesian prior (Indian Buffet Process) enables learning
the number of communities automatically from the data. However, despite its
appealing properties, inference in LFRM remains a challenge and is typically
done via MCMC methods. This can be slow and may take a long time to converge.
In this work, we develop a small-variance asymptotics based framework for the

the nonparametric Bayesian flavor of LFRM, while enabling us to design
deterministic inference algorithms for this model, that are easy to implement

robustness of individual features to adversarial perturbations. We demonstrate
that, under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity, both problems can be
approximated using finite optimisation by discretising the input space, and the

that the resulting optimisation problems can be reduced to the solution of
two-player turn-based games, where the first player selects features and the
second perturbs the image within the feature. While the second player aims to
minimise the distance to an adversarial example, depending on the optimisation
objective the first player can be cooperative or competitive. We employ an
anytime approach to solve the games, in the sense of approximating the value of
a game by monotonically improving its upper and lower bounds. The Monte Carlo
tree search algorithm is applied to compute upper bounds for both games, and
the Admissible A* and the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms are, respectively, used
to compute lower bounds for the maximum safety radius and feature robustness

particle configuration satisfies two constraints: (i) the volume of the Voronoi

configuration is uniform and isotropic, follows perfectly the minimal power

interactions. It is natural to incorporate periodic boundary conditions during
CCVT making, therefore, we can obtain a larger CCVT by tiling with a small
periodic CCVT. When applying the CCVT pre-initial condition to cosmological
$N$-body simulations, we show that it plays as good as grid and glass schemes.
The CCVT method will be helpful in studying the numerical convergence of
pre-initial conditions in cosmological simulations. It can also be used to set

average profile of helium abundance N{\alpha}/Np for interval of 1976-2016. Our
results confirm main early obtained results: N{\alpha}/Np is higher in
quasi-stationary fast streams than in slow ones; it slowly changes in
compression regions CIRs and Sheaths from values in undisturbed solar wind to
values in corresponding type of piston (HSS or ICME); in Ejecta it is closed to
abundance in undisturbed streams and it is maximal in MCs. We obtained for

N{\alpha}/Np vs. {\beta} dependence is stronger in MCs than in Ejecta and may
be used as an indicator of conditions in CME formation place on the Sun.

The research presented in this paper is part of a larger project examining the
role of the PICUP workshop in facilitating both the integration of computation
into classrooms and developing a supportive community to support this
integration. An important part of providing the necessary supports for
integration is understanding and categorizing the problems members of this

Through individual and group interviews, we discuss the barriers to integration

Two methods to estimate the variance of general maximum likelihood estimators

creating the original KNS the intention of the authors was to develop such a
smoothing method that preserves the marginal distributions of the original

the advantages of both previous versions. Beside its advantageous properties,
this novel smoothing method is shown to achieve about the same results as the

The rst phase (instrumentation and tracing) yields a run-time trace that

torsional oscillation velocity using helioseismic data for the first time. We
study the north-south asymmetry in the velocity using the zonal flow velocities

surviving companion, the mass donor that brought the white dwarf to the point

strategies avoid the user involvement for tuning detection thresholds, and
allow one to account fairly for different pattern sizes. On the other hand,
a-contrario criteria become intractable when the pattern complexity in terms of
parametrization increases. In this work, we introduce a strategy which relies
on the use of a cumulative space of reduced dimensionality, derived from the
coupling of a classic (Hough) cumulative space with an integral histogram
trick. This space allows us to store partial computations which are required by
the a-contrario criterion, and to evaluate the significance with a lower
computational cost than by following a straightforward approach. The method is
illustrated on synthetic examples on patterns with various parametrizations up
to five dimensions. In order to demonstrate how to apply this generic concept
in a real scenario, we consider a difficult crack detection task in still
images, which has been addressed in the literature with various local and
global detection strategies. We model cracks as bounded segments, detected by
the proposed a-contrario criterion, which allow us to introduce additional
spatial constraints based on their relative alignment. On this application, the
proposed strategy yields state-of the-art results, and underlines its potential
for handling complex pattern detection tasks.

important contributors to the elements that form dust in the interstellar
medium of galaxies, in particular, carbon and iron. However, they require at
least a Gyr to start producing these elements, therefore, a change in dust
quantity or properties may appear at high redshifts. In this work, we use
extinction of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows as a tool to look for variations
in dust properties at z>3. We use a spectroscopically selected sample of GRB
afterglows observed with the VLT/X-shooter instrument to determine extinction
curves out to high redshifts. We present ten new z>3 X-shooter GRBs of which
six are dusty. Combining these with individual extinction curves of three
previously known z>3 GRBs, we find an average extinction curve consistent with
the SMC-Bar. A comparison with spectroscopically selected GRBs at all redshifts
indicates a drop in visual extinction (A_V) at z>3.5 with no moderate or high
extinction bursts. We check for observational bias using template spectra and
find that GRBs up to z~8 are detectable with X-shooter up to A_V~0.3 mag.
Although other biases are noted, a uniformly low dust content above z>3.5
indicates a real drop, suggesting a transition in dust properties and/or
available dust building blocks. The remarkable increase in dust content at
z<3.5 could arise due to carbon and possibly iron production by the first
carbon-rich AGB and Type Ia SNe, respectively. Alternatively, z>3.5 dust drop
could be the result of low stellar masses of GRB host galaxies.

experimentally. In order to recognize the role of different mechanisms, we
carried out detailed measurements of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in
gated structures with a quantum well widths from $8$ to $18$ nm over a wide
range of electron density. With increasing electron density controlled by the
gate voltage, splitting of the maximum of the Fourier spectrum $f_0$ into two
components $f_1$ and $f_2$ and the appearance of the low-frequency component
$f_3$ was observed. Analysis of these results shows that the components $f_1$
and $f_2$ give the electron densities $n_1$ and $n_2$ in spin-orbit split
subbands while the $f_3$ component results from magneto-intersubband
oscillations so that $f_3=f_1 - f_2$. Comparison of these data with results of
self-consistent calculations carried out within the framework of four-band
\emph{kP}-model shows that a main contribution to spin-orbit splitting comes
from the Bychkov-Rashba effect. Contribution of the interface inversion
asymmetry to the splitting of the conduction band turns out to be four-to-five
times less than that for the valence band in the same structures.

probability matrices of the Markov chain. By incorporating the idea from robust
principle component analysis, tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) based
tensor nuclear norm is imposed to preserve the low-rank property of the
essential tensor, which can well capture the principle information from
multiple views. We also employ the tensor rotation operator for this task to
better investigate the relationship among views as well as reduce the
computation complexity. The proposed method can be efficiently optimized by the
alternating direction method of multipliers~(ADMM). Extensive experiments on
six real world datasets corresponding to five different applications show that
our method achieves superior performance over other state-of-the-art methods.

randomized NC-circuits with derandomization being possible only if it is also

Additionally, the practical potential of the proposed model was tested by

players $\mathcal P$. Every resource $j\in\mathcal R$ has a value $v_j$ and
every player $i$ desires a set $\mathcal R(i)$ of resources. We are interested
in distributing the resources to players that desire them. The quality of a
solution is measured by the least happy player, i.e., the lowest sum of
resource values. This value should be maximized. The local search algorithm by
Asadpour et al. and its connection to the configuration LP has proved itself to
be a very influential technique for this and related problems. In the original
proof, a local search was used to obtain a bound of $4$ for the ratio of the
fractional to the integral optimum of the configuration LP (integrality gap).
This bound is non-constructive since the local search has not been shown to
terminate in polynomial time. On the negative side, the worst instance known
has an integrality gap of $2$. Although much progress was made in this area,
neither bound has been improved since. We present a better analysis that shows
the integrality gap is not worse than $3 + 5/6 \approx 3.8333$.

within the long-wavelength limit, i.e., the electromagnetic field is assumed to
be spatially uniform. In this limit the so-called length-gauge transformation
for a fully quantized light-matter system gives rise to a dipole self-energy
term in the Hamiltonian, i.e., a harmonic potential of the total dipole matter
moment. In practice this term is often discarded as it is assumed to be
subsumed in the kinetic energy term. In this work we show the necessity of the
dipole self-energy term. First and foremost, without it the light-matter system
in the long-wavelength limit does not have a ground-state, i.e., the combined
light-matter system is unstable. Further, the mixing of matter and photon
degrees of freedom due to the length-gauge transformation, which also changes
the representation of the translation operator for matter, gives rise to the
Maxwell equations in matter and the omittance of the dipole self-energy leads
to a violation of these equations. Specifically we show that without the dipole
self-energy the so-called 'depolarization shift' is not properly described.
Finally we show that this term also arises if we perform the semi-classical
limit after the length-gauge transformation. In contrast to the standard
approach where the semi-classical limit is performed before the length-gauge
transformation, the resulting Hamiltonian is bounded from below and thus
supports ground-states. This is very important for practical calculations and
for density-functional variational implementations of the non-relativistic QED
formalism. For example, the existence of a combined light-matter ground-state
allows one to calculate the Stark shift non-perturbatively.

approaches to DBP modelling and simulation have been incomplete, i.e. they lack

the modelling and simulation of a static BP that strictly prescribes which

strictly at the beginning of its execution, and it changes under new conditions
at runtime. In our paper, we propose six requirements of DBP and an approach
for rule- and context-based DBP modelling and simulation. The approach is based
on changing BP rules, BP actions and their sequences at process instance
runtime, according to the new business system context. Based on the proposed
approach, a reference architecture and prototype of a DBP simulation tool were
developed. Modelling and simulation were carried out using this prototype, and
the case study shows correspondence to the needs of dynamically changing

stochastic multilayer network is the aggregation of $M$ networks (one per

network is the result of probabilistically removing links and nodes from $G$.
The resulting network includes any link that appears in at least $K$ layers.
This model is an instance of a non-standard site-bond percolation model. Two
sets of results are obtained: first, we derive the probability distribution
that the $M$-layer network is in a given configuration for some particular
graph structures (explicit results are provided for a line and an algorithm is
provided for a tree), where a configuration is the collective state of all
links (each either active or inactive). Next, we show that for appropriate
scalings of the node and link selection processes in a layer, links are
asymptotically independent as the number of layers goes to infinity, and follow
Poisson distributions. Numerical results are provided to highlight the impact
of having several layers on some metrics of interest (including expected size
of the cluster a node belongs to in the case of the line). This model finds
applications in wireless communication networks with multichannel radios,
multiple social networks with overlapping memberships, transportation networks,
and, more generally, in any scenario where a common set of nodes can be linked

group $H_1(K)$ of a simplicial $2$-complex $K$ embedded linearly in

puts a major roadblock to computing persistence and a homology basis
(generators) for complexes embedded in $\mathbb{R}^4$ and beyond in less than
quadratic or even near-quadratic time. But, what about dimension three? It is
known that persistence for piecewise linear functions on a complex $K$ with $n$
simplices can be computed in $O(n\log n)$ time and a set of generators of total
size $k$ can be computed in $O(n+k)$ time when $K$ is a graph or a surface
linearly embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. But, the question for general simplicial
complexes $K$ linearly embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is not completely settled. No
algorithm with a complexity better than that of the matrix multiplication is
known for this important case. We show that the persistence for {\em height

analysis of the stellar halo from detailed maps of Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB)
stars drawn from the SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey. To isolate candidate BHB
stars from the overall population, we develop a machine-learning approach
through the application of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), resulting in a
relatively pure sample of target stars. From this, we derive the absolute $u$
magnitude for the BHB sample to be $\sim2\ mag$, varying slightly with
$(v-g)_0$ and $(u-v)_0$ colours. We examine the BHB number density distribution
from 5272 candidate stars, deriving a double power-law with a break radius of
$r_s = 11.8\pm0.3\ kpc$, and inner and outer slopes of $\alpha_{in} =
-2.5\pm0.1$ and $\alpha_{out} = -4.5\pm0.3$ respectively. Through isochrone
fitting of simulated BHB stars, we find a colour-age/metallicity correlation,
with older/more metal-poor stars being bluer, and establish a parameter to
indicate this age (or metallicity) variation. Using this, we construct the
three-dimensional population distribution of BHB stars in the halo and identify
significant substructure. Finally, in agreement with previous studies, we also
identify a systemic age/metallicity shift spanning $\sim3\ kpc$ to $ \sim20\
kpc$ in galactocentric distance.

longitudinal vortex generators have been numerically investigated in the range
of Reynolds numbers between 25 and 200. Aqueous solutions of carboxymethyl
cellulose (CMC) with different concentrations (200-2000 ppm), which are
shear-thinning non-Newtonian liquids, have been utilised as working fluid.
Three-dimensional simulations have been performed on a plain channel and a
channel with five pairs of vortex generators. The channels have a hydraulic
diameter of 8 mm and are heated by constant wall temperature. The vortex
generators have been mounted at different angles of attack and locations inside
the channel. The shear-thinning liquid flow in rectangular channels with
longitudinal vortex generators are described and the mechanisms of heat
transfer enhancement are discussed. The results demonstrate a heat transfer
enhancement of 39-188% using CMC aqueous solutions in rectangular channels with
LVGs with respect to a Newtonian liquid flow (i.e. water). Additionally, it is
shown that equipping rectangular channels with LVGs results in an enhancement
of 24-135% in heat transfer performance vis-\`a-vis plain channel. However,
this heat transfer enhancement is associated with larger pressure losses. For
the range of parameters studied in this paper, increasing the CMC
concentration, the angle of attack of vortex generators and their lateral
distances leads to an increase in heat transfer performance. Additionally, heat
transfer performance of rectangular channels with longitudinal vortex
generators enhances with increasing the Reynolds number in the laminar flow
regime.

With the help of vertex reconstruction, we show that this ""continuum"" approach

quantitative estimates for vertex form factors and related quantities of

demonstrate numerically and analytically that there exist special kinematic

equal to the continuum ones, regardless of the details of the lattice
implementation. We ran our simulations for an $SU(2)$ gauge theory in two and

cloud. As they do not naturally belong to a Hilbert space, standard statistical
methods cannot be directly applied to them. Instead, feature maps (or
representations) are commonly used for the analysis. A large class of feature
maps, which we call linear, depends on some weight functions, the choice of
which is a critical issue. An important criterion to choose a weight function
is to ensure stability of the feature maps with respect to Wasserstein
distances on diagrams. We improve known results on the stability of such maps,
and extend it to general weight functions. We also address the choice of the
weight function by considering an asymptotic setting; assume that
$\mathbb{X}_n$ is an i.i.d. sample from a density on $[0,1]^d$. For the
\v{C}ech and Rips filtrations, we characterize the weight functions for which
the corresponding feature maps converge as $n$ approaches infinity, and by
doing so, we prove laws of large numbers for the total persistences of such
diagrams. Those two approaches (stability and convergence) lead to the same
simple heuristic for tuning weight functions: if the data lies near a
$d$-dimensional manifold, then a sensible choice of weight function is the
persistence to the power $\alpha$ with $\alpha \geq d$.

The unusual transient ATLAS17aeu was serendipitously detected within the
sky localisation of the gravitational wave trigger GW170104. The importance of
a possible association with gravitational waves coming from a binary black hole
merger led to an extensive follow-up campaign, with the aim of assessing a
possible connection with GW170104. Methods. With several telescopes, we carried
out both photometric and spectroscopic observations of ATLAS17aeu, for several
epochs, between $\sim 3$ and $\sim 230$ days after the first detection.
Results. We studied in detail the temporal and spectroscopic properties of
ATLAS17aeu and its host galaxy. We detected spectral features similar to those
of a broad lined supernova superposed to an otherwise typical long-GRB
afterglow. Based on analysis of the optical light curve, spectrum and host
galaxy SED, we conclude that the redshift of the source is probably $z \simeq
0.5 \pm 0.2$. Conclusions. While the redshift range we have determined is
marginally compatible with that of the gravitational wave event, the presence
of a supernova component and the consistency of this transient with the E$_{\rm

result of the dramatic increase in density and temperature following the

neutron stars including quarks at finite temperatures that can be switched off
consistently in the equation of state. Within our approach, we can determine
clearly what signatures a quark-hadron phase transition would leave in the

met for a phase transition to take place at several times nuclear saturation
density, they would lead to a post-merger signal considerably different from
the one expected from the inspiral, that can only probe the hadronic part of
the equations of state, and to an anticipated collapse of the merged object. We
also show that the phase transition leads to a very hot and dense quark core
that, when it collapses to a black hole, produces a ringdown signal different
from the hadronic one. Finally, in analogy with what is done in heavy-ion
collisions, we use the evolution of the temperature and density in the merger

of diffuse magnetic scattering with a resonance-like gap of $\approx$ 7 meV,

correlations persist to high temperature. Nevertheless, the size and

described by local moment with $J=4$. Furthermore, polarized neutron
measurements reveal that the magnetic fluctuations are mostly transverse, with

dynamics of the strong interaction and the structure of the colliding hadrons.
One of the most basic jet production observables is the single jet inclusive
cross section, which is obtained by summing all jets that are observed in an
event. Our recent computation of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD
contributions to single jet inclusive observables uncovered large corrections
in certain kinematical regions, which also resulted in a sizeable ambiguity on
the appropriate choice of renormalization and factorization scales. We now
perform a detailed investigation of the infrared sensitivity of the different
ingredients to the single jet inclusive cross section. We show that the
contribution from the second jet, ordered in transverse momentum $p_{T}$, in
the event is particularly sensitive to higher order effects due to implicit
restrictions on its kinematics. By investigating the second-jet transverse
momentum distribution, we identify large-scale cancellations between different
kinematical event configurations, which are aggravated by certain types of
scale choice. Taking perturbative convergence and stability as selection
criteria enables us to single out the total partonic transverse energy
$\hat{H}_{T}$ and twice the individual jet transverse momentum $2\,p_{T}$ (with
which $\hat{H}_{T}$ coincides in Born kinematics) as the most appropriate
scales in the perturbative description of single jet inclusive production.

candidates of dark matter. It is also shown rigorously that the two-field

that the Q-balls with one-loop motivated effective potential can exist with the

reduce the energy density, so there probably have been more and more stable

findings in a computational model of seizure dynamics to suggest a plausible
mechanism of epileptogenesis. Patients with IGE have significant bilateral
alterations in major white-matter fascicles. In the cingulum, fornix, and
superior longitudinal fasciculus, tract integrity is compromised, whereas in
specific parts of tracts between thalamus and the precentral gyrus, tract
integrity is enhanced in patients. Combining these alterations in a logistic
regression model, we computed the decision boundary that discriminated patients
and controls. The computational model, informed with the findings on the tract
abnormalities, specifically highlighted the importance of enhanced
cortico-reticular connections along with impaired cortico-cortical connections
in inducing pathological seizure-like dynamics. We emphasise taking
directionality of brain connectivity into consideration towards understanding
the pathological mechanisms; this is possible by combining neuroimaging and
computational modelling. Our imaging evidence of structural alterations suggest
the loss of cortico-cortical and enhancement of cortico-thalamic fibre
integrity in IGE. We further suggest that impaired connectivity from cortical
regions to the thalamic reticular nucleus offers a therapeutic target for

compare the electron extraction efficiency across Au/TiO2 and titanium
oxynitride/TiO2-x interfaces, where in the latter case the spontaneously
forming oxide layer (TiO2-x) creates a metal-semiconductor contact.
Time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy is used to study the electron
recombination rates in both cases. Unlike the nanosecond recombination
lifetimes in Au/TiO2, we find a bottleneck in the electron relaxation in the
TiON system, which we explain using a trap-mediated recombination model. Using
this model, we investigate the tunability of the relaxation dynamics with
oxygen content in the parent film. The optimized film (TiO0.5N0.5) exhibits the
highest carrier extraction efficiency, slowest trapping and an appreciable hot
electron population reaching the surface oxide. Our results demonstrate the
productive role oxygen can play in enhancing electron harvesting and elongating
electron lifetimes providing an optimized metal-semiconductor interface using
only the native oxide of titanium oxynitride.

cooperative and competitive. These two domains have traditionally remained
mostly disjoint, with cooperative threading used for increasing throughput in
compute-intensive applications such as scientific workloads and cooperative
threading used for increasing responsiveness in interactive applications such
as GUIs and games. As multicore hardware becomes increasingly mainstream, there
is a need for bridging these two disjoint worlds, because many applications mix
interaction and computation and would benefit from both cooperative and
competitive threading.
  In this paper, we present techniques for programming and reasoning about
parallel interactive applications that can use both cooperative and competitive
threading. Our techniques enable the programmer to write rich parallel
interactive programs by creating and synchronizing with threads as needed, and
by assigning threads user-defined and partially ordered priorities. To ensure
important responsiveness properties, we present a modal type system analogous
to S4 modal logic that precludes low-priority threads from delaying
high-priority threads, thereby statically preventing a crucial set of
priority-inversion bugs. We then present a cost model that allows reasoning
about responsiveness and completion time of well-typed programs. The cost model
extends the traditional work-span model for cooperative threading to account
for competitive scheduling decisions needed to ensure responsiveness. Finally,
we show that our proposed techniques are realistic by implementing them as an
extension to the Standard ML language.

almost uninterrupted photometry for hundreds of $\gamma$ Doradus stars and tens
of SPB stars, finally allowing us to apply asteroseismology to these gravity
mode pulsators. Without rotation, gravity modes are equally spaced in period.
This simple structure does not hold in rotating stars for which rotation needs
to be taken into account to accurately interpret the oscillation spectrum. We
aim to develop a stellar-model-independent method to analyse and interpret the
oscillation spectrum of $\gamma$ Dor and SPB stars. Within the traditional
approximation of rotation, we highlight the possibility of recovering the
equidistance of period spacings by stretching the pulsation periods. The
stretching function depends on the degree and azimuthal order of gravity modes
and the rotation rate of the star. In this new stretched space, the pulsation
modes are regularly spaced by the stellar buoyancy radius. On the basis of this
property, we implemented a method to search for these new regularities and
simultaneously infer the rotation frequency and buoyancy radius. Tests on
synthetic spectra computed with a non-perturbative approach show that we can
retrieve these two parameters with reasonable accuracy along with the mode
identification. In uniformly rotating models of a typical $\gamma$ Dor star,
and for the most observed prograde dipole modes, we show that the accuracy on
the derived parameters is better than 5% on both the internal rotation rate and
the buoyancy radius. Finally, we apply the method to two stars of the Kepler
field, a $\gamma$ Dor and an SPB, and compare our results with those of other
existing methods. We provide a stellar-model-independent method to obtain the
near-core rotation rate, the buoyancy radius and mode identification from

function is a convex combination of a stochastic continuous function and a
deterministic function. Such a setting generalizes the widely-studied
stochastic state transition setting, namely the setting of deterministic policy
gradient (DPG).
  We firstly give a simple example to illustrate that the deterministic policy
gradient may be infinite under deterministic state transitions, and introduce a
theoretical technique to prove the existence of the policy gradient in this
generalized setting. Using this technique, we prove that the deterministic
policy gradient indeed exists for a certain set of discount factors, and
further prove two conditions that guarantee the existence for all discount
factors. We then derive a closed form of the policy gradient whenever exists.
Furthermore, to overcome the challenge of high sample complexity of DPG in this
setting, we propose the Generalized Deterministic Policy Gradient (GDPG)
algorithm. The main innovation of the algorithm is a new method of applying
model-based techniques to the model-free algorithm, the deep deterministic
policy gradient algorithm (DDPG). GDPG optimize the long-term rewards of the
model-based augmented MDP subject to a constraint that the long-rewards of the
MDP is less than the original one.
  We finally conduct extensive experiments comparing GDPG with state-of-the-art
methods and the direct model-based extension method of DDPG on several standard
continuous control benchmarks. Results demonstrate that GDPG substantially
outperforms DDPG, the model-based extension of DDPG and other baselines in

in the evolution of many regions of the interstellar medium, from molecular
clouds to planet-forming disks. In cold regions of the ISM, water is expected
to be completely frozen out onto the dust grains. Nonetheless, observations
indicate the presence of cold water vapor, implying that non-thermal desorption
mechanisms are at play. Photodesorption by UV photons has been proposed to
explain these observations, with the support of extensive experimental and
theoretical work on ice analogues. In contrast, photodesorption by X-rays,
another viable mechanism, has been little studied. The potential of this
process to desorb key molecules, such as water, intact rather than fragmented
or ionised, remains unexplored. We experimentally investigated X-ray
photodesorption from water ice, monitoring all desorbing species. We find that
desorption of neutral water is efficient, while ion desorption is minor. We
derive for the first time yields that can be implemented in astrochemical
models. These results open up the possibility of taking into account the X-ray
photodesorption process in the modelling of protoplanetary disks or X-ray

damaging the structure and function of affected organs. Different kind of
interactors can interfere with the formation of protein dimers and multimers in

extremely efficient extension of their interaction surface. In particular
citrate-coated gold nanoparticles (cit-AuNPs) were recently investigated with
amyloidogenic protein $\beta$2-microglobulin ($\beta$2m). Here we present the
computational studies on two challenging models known for their enhanced
amyloidogenic propensity, namely $\Delta$N6 and D76N $\beta$2m naturally
occurring variants, and disclose the role of cit-AuNPs on their
fibrillogenesis. The proposed interaction mechanism lies in the interference of
the cit-AuNPs with the protein dimers at the early stages of aggregation, that
induces dimer disassembling. As a consequence, natural fibril formation can be
inhibited. Relying on the comparison between atomistic simulations at multiple
levels (enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics) and protein
structural characterisation by NMR, we demonstrate that the cit-AuNPs
interactors are able to inhibit protein dimer assembling. As a consequence, the
natural fibril formation is also inhibited, as found in experiment.

dynamic multidimensional system (stochastic cellular automaton) to a
one-dimensional system to analyse the dynamics. Using maximum likelihood
estimation, we can estimate the parameter of interest which, in combination
with a bifurcation diagram, reflects the expectancy that someone has to
transition to another mood state. After validating the proposed method with
simulated data, we apply this method to two empirical examples, where we show
its use in a clinical sample consisting of patients diagnosed with major
depressive disorder, and a general population sample. Results showed that the
majority of the clinical sample was categorized as having an expectancy for a
transition, while the majority of the general population sample did not have

dynamic environments, where the ability to respond to changing circumstances is
a crucial feature. An effective collective response requires suitable
information transfer among agents, and thus is critically dependent on the
agents' interaction network. In order to investigate the influence of the
network topology on collective response, we consider an archetypal model of
distributed decision-making---the leader-follower linear consensus---and study
the collective capacity of the system to follow a dynamic driving signal (the
""leader"") for a range of topologies and system sizes. The analysis reveals a
nontrivial relationship between optimal topology and frequency of the driving
signal. Interestingly, the response is optimal when each individual interacts
with a certain number of agents which decreases monotonically with the
frequency and, for large enough systems, is independent of the size of the
system. This phenomenology is investigated in experiments of collective motion
using a swarm of land robots. The emergent collective response to both a slow-
and a fast-changing leader is measured and analyzed for a range of interaction
topologies. These results have far-reaching practical implications for the
design and understanding of distributed systems, since they highlight that a
dynamic rewiring of the interaction network is paramount to the effective
collective operations of multi-agent systems at different time-scales.

hydrological processes. However, this approach can be computationally
demanding, as it usually requires a large number of model evaluations. To
address this issue, one can take advantage of surrogate modeling techniques.
Nevertheless, when approximation error of the surrogate model is neglected, the
inversion result will be biased. In this paper, we develop a surrogate-based
Bayesian inversion framework that explicitly quantifies and gradually reduces
the approximation error of the surrogate. Specifically, two strategies are
proposed to quantify the surrogate error. The first strategy works by
quantifying the surrogate prediction uncertainty with a Bayesian method, while
the second strategy uses another surrogate to simulate and correct the
approximation error of the primary surrogate. By adaptively refining the
surrogate over the posterior distribution, we can gradually reduce the
surrogate approximation error to a small level. Demonstrated with three case
studies involving high dimensionality, multimodality, and a real-world
application, it is found that both strategies can reduce the bias introduced by
surrogate approximation error, while the second strategy that integrates two
methods (i.e., polynomial chaos expansion and Gaussian process in this work)
that complement each other shows the best performance.

collected data are critical to efficiently identify behavioral models. We
extend a seminal method for designing Bayesian optimal experiments by
introducing two computational improvements that make the procedure tractable:
(1) a search algorithm from artificial intelligence that efficiently explores
the space of possible design parameters, and (2) a sampling procedure which
evaluates each design parameter combination more efficiently. We apply our
procedure to a game of imperfect information to evaluate and quantify the
computational improvements. We then collect data across five different
experimental designs to compare the ability of the optimal experimental design
to discriminate among competing behavioral models against the experimental
designs chosen by a ""wisdom of experts"" prediction experiment. We find that
data from the experiment suggested by the optimal design approach requires
significantly less data to distinguish behavioral models (i.e., test
hypotheses) than data from the experiment suggested by experts. Substantively,
we find that reinforcement learning best explains human decision-making in the
imperfect information game and that behavior is not adequately described by the
Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Our procedure is general and computationally
efficient and can be applied to dynamically optimize online experiments.

assume flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) geometry filled with perfect fluid
matter contents. We study two cases in this gravity: One is for a general
function of $f(T,B)$, and the other is for a particular form of it given by the
term of $-T+F(B)$. We also formulate the general energy constraints for these
cases. Furthermore, we explore the validity of the bounds on the energy
conditions by specifying different forms of$f(T,B)$ and $F(B)$ function
obtained by the reconstruction scheme for de Sitter, power-law, the
$\Lambda$CDM and Phantom cosmological models. Moreover, the possible
constraints on the free model parameters are examined with the help of region
graphs. In addition, we explore the evolution of the effective equation of

essential part of building knowledge from data. However, as the size and
dimensionality of input data increases, the run-time for such clustering
algorithms is expected to grow superlinearly, making it a big challenge when
dealing with BigData. K-mean clustering is an essential tool for many big data
applications including data mining, predictive analysis, forecasting studies,
and machine learning. However, due to large size (volume) of Big-Data, and
large dimensionality of its data points, even the application of a simple
k-mean clustering may become extremely time and resource demanding. Specially
when it is necessary to have a fast and modular dataset analysis flow. In this
paper, we demonstrate that using a two-level filtering algorithm based on
binary kd-tree structure is able to decrease the time of convergence in K-means
algorithm for large datasets. The two-level filtering algorithm based on binary
kd-tree structure evolves the SW to naturally divide the classification into
smaller data sets, based on the number of available cores and size of logic
available in a target FPGA. The empirical result on this two-level structure
over multi-core FPGA-based architecture provides 330X speed-up compared to a

multimedia computing and machine learning: Do artifacts from perceptual
compression contribute to error in the machine learning process and if so, how
much? Our approach to the problem is a reinterpretation of the Helmholtz Free
Energy formula from physics to explain the relationship between content and
noise when using sensors (such as cameras or microphones) to capture multimedia
data. The reinterpretation allows a bit-measurement of the noise contained in
images, audio, and video by combining a classifier with perceptual compression,
such as JPEG or MP3. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 as well as Fraunhofer's
IDMT-SMT-Audio-Effects dataset indicate that, at the right quality level,
perceptual compression is actually not harmful but contributes to a significant
reduction of complexity of the machine learning process. That is, our noise
quantification method can be used to speed up the training of deep learning
classifiers significantly while maintaining, or sometimes even improving,
overall classification accuracy. Moreover, our results provide insights into
the reasons for the success of deep learning.

ledger of transactions without relying on a central authority and to deploy
scripts, called smart contracts, that are executed whenever certain
transactions occur. These features can be used as basic building blocks for
executing collaborative business processes between mutually untrusting parties.
However, implementing business processes using the low-level primitives
provided by blockchain platforms is cumbersome and error-prone. In contrast,
established business process management systems, such as those based on the
standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), provide convenient
abstractions for rapid development of process-oriented applications. This
article demonstrates how to combine the advantages of a business process
management system with those of a blockchain platform. The article introduces a
blockchain-based BPMN execution engine, namely Caterpillar. Like any BPMN
execution engine, Caterpillar supports the creation of instances of a process
model and allows users to monitor the state of process instances and to execute
tasks thereof. The specificity of Caterpillar is that the state of each process
instance is maintained on the (Ethereum) blockchain and the workflow routing is
performed by smart contracts generated by a BPMN-to-Solidity compiler. The
Caterpillar compiler supports a large array of BPMN constructs, including
subprocesses, multi-instances activities and event handlers. The paper
describes the architecture of Caterpillar, and the interfaces it provides to
support the monitoring of process instances, the allocation and execution of
work items, and the execution of service tasks.
