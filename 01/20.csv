distill a list of the main factors influencing productivity investigated so
far. The measure for importance here is the number of articles a factor is

combined effect of stellar winds from hot stars and supernova explosions
creates a high-temperature cavity in the nuclear region of these objects. The
very hot gas expands adiabatically and escapes from the galaxy creating a
superwind which sweeps matter from the galactic disk. The superwind region in
the halo is filled with a multi-phase gas with hot, warm, cool, and
relativistic components. The shocks associated with the superwind of starbursts
and the turbulent gas region of the bubble inflated by them might accelerate
cosmic rays up to high energies. In this work we calculate the cosmic ray
production associated with the superwind using parameters that correspond to
the nearby southern starburst galaxy NGC 253, which has been suggested as a
potential accelerator of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We evaluate the
efficiency of both diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) and stochastic diffusive
acceleration (SDA) in the superwind of NGC 253. We estimate the distribution of
both hadrons and leptons and calculate the corresponding spectral energy
distributions of photons. We find that the strong mass load of the superwind,
recently determined through ALMA observations, strongly attenuates the
efficiency of DSA in NGC 253, whereas SDA is constrained by the age of the
starburst. We conclude that NGC 253 and similar starbursts can only accelerate
iron nuclei beyond $\sim10^{18}$ eV under very special conditions. If the
central region of the galaxy harbors a starved supermassive black hole of
$\sim10^6$ $M_{\odot}$, as suggested by some recent observations, a
contribution in the range $10^{18}-10^{19}$ eV can be present for accretion
rates $\dot{m}\sim10^{-3}$ in Eddington units. Only if very strong magnetic
field amplification occurs close to the superwind shock energies of the order
of 100 EeV might be achieved.

proceeding from only the crystal structure of a particular compound. The
proposed approach uses the concept of the self-localization of doped carriers
due to their formation of trion complexes that represent a bound state of the
doped carrier and charge transfer excitons emerging under its influence. Here,
as exemplified by cuprates, we show that the use of the proposed approach to
the analysis of the transformation of an electronic structure with doping
enables an explanation to a range of their anomalies: Fermi arcs, large and
small pseudogaps etc. The basic conclusion is that the role of the Fermi
surface in cuprates is played by an isoenergetic contour that emerges at the
sectioning of the surface of a band dispersion by a dispersionless ""biexciton""
pair level. This level additionally plays the role of an acceptor to lead to
the emergence of hole carriers on the isoenergetic contour and to a jump of the
chemical potential. Based on the conducted consideration, we propose a possible
mechanism of superconducting pairing genetically inherent in such a system.

$-dE/dx$ is the transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ times $L$ the length traveled.
This results in jet quenching, which is well established. However BDMPSZ also
predicts an azimuthal broadening of di-jets also proportional to $\hat{q}L$
which has so far not been observed. The broadening should produce a larger
$k_T$ in A$+$A than in p$+$p collisions. This presentation introduces the
observation that the $k_T$ measured in p$+$p collisions for di-hadrons with
$p_{Tt}$ and $p_{Ta}$ must be reduced to compensate for the energy loss of both
the trigger and away parent partons when comparing to the $k_T$ measured with
the same di-hadron $p_{Tt}$ and $p_{Ta}$ in A$+$A collisions. This idea is
applied to a recent STAR di-hadron measurement in Au$+$Au at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV, [Phys. Lett. B760 (2016) 689], with result
$<{\hat{q}L}>=2.1\pm 0.6$ GeV$^2$. This is more precise but in agreement with a
theoretical calculation of $<{\hat{q}L}>=14^{+42}_{-14}$ GeV$^2$ using the same
data. Assuming a length $<{L}>\approx 7$ fm for central Au$+$Au collisions the
present result gives $\hat{q}\approx 0.30\pm 0.09$ GeV$^2$/fm, in fair
agreement with the JET collaboration result from single hadron suppression of
$\hat{q}\approx 1.2\pm 0.3$ GeV$^2$/fm at an initial time $\tau_0=0.6$ fm/c in
Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. There are several interesting
details to be discussed: for a given $p_{Tt}$ the $<{\hat{q}L}>$ seems to
decrease then vanish with increasing $p_{Ta}$; the di-jet spends a much longer
time in the medium ($\approx 7$ fm/c) then $\tau_0=0.6$ fm/c which likely
affects the value of $\hat{q}$ that would be observed.

applications in speech synthesis, playback systems, voice conversion,
learning/hearing aids, etc.. There is a requirement for computationally
efficient and real-time implementable algorithms. In this paper, we propose a
high quality and computationally efficient time- and pitch-scaling methodology
based on the glottal closure instants (GCIs) or epochs in speech signals. The
proposed algorithm, termed as epoch-synchronous overlap-add time/pitch-scaling
(ESOLA-TS/PS), segments speech signals into overlapping short-time frames and
then the adjacent frames are aligned with respect to the epochs and the frames
are overlap-added to synthesize time-scale modified speech. Pitch scaling is
achieved by resampling the time-scaled speech by a desired sampling factor. We
also propose a concept of epoch embedding into speech signals, which
facilitates the identification and time-stamping of samples corresponding to
epochs and using them for time/pitch-scaling to multiple scaling factors
whenever desired, thereby contributing to faster and efficient implementation.
The results of perceptual evaluation tests reported in this paper indicate the
superiority of ESOLA over state-of-the-art techniques. ESOLA significantly
outperforms the conventional pitch synchronous overlap-add (PSOLA) techniques
in terms of perceptual quality and intelligibility of the modified speech.
Unlike the waveform similarity overlap-add (WSOLA) or synchronous overlap-add
(SOLA) techniques, the ESOLA technique has the capability to do exact
time-scaling of speech with high quality to any desired modification factor
within a range of 0.5 to 2. Compared to synchronous overlap-add with fixed
synthesis (SOLAFS), the ESOLA is computationally advantageous and at least
three times faster.

facilitating intelligent transportation systems. Since the vehicles move fast

random fashion, which imposes diverse challenges in routing protocol design
over VANET. When it comes to the 5G era, the fulfilment of ultra low end-to-end

we propose a novel routing protocol that incorporates mobility status and MAC
layer channel contention information. The proposed routing protocol determines
next hop by applying mobility information and MAC contention information which
differs from existing greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR) protocol.
Simulation results of the proposed routing protocol show its performance

and strongly coupled to thin superconducting layers have been extensively
explored in recent experiments as promising platforms to host Majorana bound
states. We study numerically such a geometry, consisting of a
quasi-one-dimensional wire coupled to a disordered three-dimensional
superconducting layer. We find that, in the strong-coupling limit of a sizable
proximity-induced superconducting gap, all transverse subbands of the wire are
significantly shifted in energy relative to the chemical potential of the wire.
For the lowest subband, this band shift is comparable in magnitude to the
spacing between quantized levels that arise due to the finite thickness of the
superconductor (which typically is $\sim500$ meV for a 10-nm-thick layer of
Aluminum); in higher subbands, the band shift is much larger. Additionally, we
show that the width of the system, which is usually much larger than the
thickness, and moderate disorder within the superconductor have almost no
impact on the induced gap or band shift. We provide a detailed discussion of
the ramifications of our results, arguing that a huge band shift and
significant renormalization of semiconducting material parameters in the
strong-coupling limit make it challenging to realize a topological phase in
such a setup, as the strong coupling to the superconductor essentially
metallizes the semiconductor. This metallization of the semiconductor can be
tested experimentally through the measurement of the band shift.

It hosts two debris
belts, which lie internally and externally to four giant planets. This paper
considers how the four known planets and a possible fifth planet, interact with
the external population of debris through N-body simulations. We find that when
only the known planets are included, the inner edge of the outer belt predicted
by our simulations is much closer to the outermost planet than recent ALMA
observations suggest. We subsequently include a fifth planet in our simulations
with a range of masses and semi-major axes, which is external to the outermost
known planet. We find that a fifth planet with a mass and semi-major axis of
0.1$\mathrm{M_J}$ and 138au predicts an outer belt that agrees well with ALMA
observations, whilst remaining stable for the lifetime of HR8799 and lying
below current direct imaging detection thresholds. We also consider whether
inward scattering of material from the outer belt can input a significant
amount of mass into the inner belt. We find that for the current age of HR8799,
only $\sim$1\% of the mass loss rate of the inner disk can be replenished by
inward scattering. However we find that the higher rate of inward scattering
during the first $\sim$10Myr of HR8799 would be expected to cause warm dust
emission at a level similar to that currently observed, which may provide an
explanation for such bright emission in other systems at $\sim10$Myr ages.

$\mathcal{H}^p$ coincide. We then proceed to study some linear space properties
of $\mathcal{H}^p$. More specifically, we study linear functionals generated by
fractional primitives of the Riemann zeta function; our estimates rely on
certain Hardy--Littlewood inequalities and display an interesting phenomenon,
called contractive symmetry between $\mathcal{H}^p$ and $\mathcal{H}^{4/p}$,
contrasting the usual $L^p$ duality. We next deduce general coefficient
estimates, based on an interplay between the multiplicative structure of
$\mathcal{H}^p$ and certain new one variable bounds. Finally, we deduce general
estimates for the norm of the partial sum operator $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n
n^{-s}\mapsto \sum_{n=1}^N a_n n^{-s}$ on $\mathcal{H}^p$ with $0< p \le 1$,
supplementing a classical result of Helson for the range $1<p<\infty$. The
results for the coefficient estimates and for the partial sum operator exhibit
the traditional schism between the ranges $1\le p \le \infty$ and $0<p<1$.

to multiple tasks without affecting performance on already learned tasks. By
building upon ideas from network quantization and pruning, we learn binary
masks that piggyback on an existing network, or are applied to unmodified
weights of that network to provide good performance on a new task. These masks
are learned in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, and incur a low overhead
of 1 bit per network parameter, per task. Even though the underlying network is
fixed, the ability to mask individual weights allows for the learning of a
large number of filters. We show performance comparable to dedicated fine-tuned
networks for a variety of classification tasks, including those with large
domain shifts from the initial task (ImageNet), and a variety of network
architectures. Unlike prior work, we do not suffer from catastrophic forgetting
or competition between tasks, and our performance is agnostic to task ordering.

among them the lack of first principle models, the size of the networks, and
difficulties with parameterization. Discrete time Boolean networks and related
continuous time switching systems provide a computationally accessible way to
translate the structure of the network to predictions about the dynamics.
Recent work has shown that the parameterized dynamics of switching systems can
be captured by a combinatorial object, called a DSGRN database, that consists
of a parameter graph characterizing a finite parameter space decomposition,
whose nodes are assigned a Morse graph that captures global dynamics for all
corresponding parameters.
  We show that for a given network there is a way to associate the same type of
object by considering a continuous time ODE system with a continuous right-hand
side, which we call an L-system. The main goal of this paper is to compare the
two DSGRN databases for the same network. Since the L-systems can be thought of
as perturbations (not necessarily small) of the switching systems, our results
address the correspondence between global parameterized dynamics of switching
systems and their perturbations. We show that, at corresponding parameters,
there is an order preserving map from the Morse graph of the switching system
to that of the L-system that is surjective on the set of attractors and
bijective on the set of fixed point attractors. We provide important examples
showing why this correspondence cannot be strengthened.

decreases outward. The critical point is typically at a height of 1-6 kpc from
the disk, increasing with V_H, and the asymptotic wind velocity exceeds the
escape speed of the halo. Mass loss rates are insensitive to the footpoint
values of the magnetic field and angular momentum. In addition to numerical
parameter space exploration, we develop and compare to analytic scaling
relations. We show that winds have mass loss rates per unit area up to ~ Pi_0
V_H^-5/3 u_0^2/3 where Pi_0 is the footpoint cosmic ray pressure and u_0 is set
by the upwelling of galactic fountains. The predicted wind mass-loss rate
exceeds the star formation rate for V_H < 200 km/s and u_0 = 50 km/s, a typical
fountain velocity.

galaxy Sp1149 hosting the SN Refsdal. Sp1149 lies at $z\simeq1.49$, has a
stellar mass $M_*\simeq5\times10^9 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$, a star-formation rate
$\mathrm{SFR} \simeq1-6 \, \mathrm{M_\odot/yr}$ and represents a likely
progenitor of a Milky-Way-like galaxy. All the four multiple images of Sp1149
in our data show strong OII-line emissions pointing to a clear rotation
pattern. We take advantage of the gravitational lensing magnification effect
($\simeq 4 \times$) on the OII emission of the least distorted image to fit 3D
kinematic models to the MUSE data-cube and derive the rotation curve and the
velocity dispersion profile of Sp1149. We find that the rotation curve steeply
rises, peaks at $R\simeq1$ kpc and then (initially) declines and flattens to an
average $V_\mathrm{flat} = 128^{+29}_{-19}$ km/s. The shape of the rotation
curve is well determined but the actual value of $V_\mathrm{flat}$ is quite
uncertain because of the nearly face-on configuration of the galaxy. The
intrinsic velocity dispersion due to gas turbulence is almost constant across
the entire disc with an average of $27\pm5$ km/s. This value is consistent with
$z=0$ measurements in the ionized gas component and a factor 2-4 lower than
other estimates in different galaxies at similar redshifts. The average
stellar-to-total mass fraction is of the order of one fifth. Our kinematic
analysis returns the picture of a regular star-forming, mildly turbulent,
rotation-dominated ($V / \sigma\simeq5$) spiral galaxy in a 4 Gyr old Universe.

included with the traditional two-parameter calibration of SN Ia light-curve

calibrations to carefully estimate the oxygen abundance of galaxies hosting SNe
Ia from the SDSS-II/SNe Survey at intermediate redshift, by measuring their
emission line intensities. We also derive electronic temperature with the
direct method for a small fraction of objects for consistency. We find a trend
of decreasing oxygen abundance with increasing redshift for the most massive
galaxies. Moreover, we study the dependence of the HD residuals (HR) with
galaxy oxygen abundance obtaining a correlation in line with those found in
other works. In particular, the HR vs oxygen abundance shows a slope of
-0.186$\pm$0.123 mag dex$^{-1}$ (1.52$\sigma$), in good agreement with
theoretical expectations. This implies smaller distance modulii after
corrections for SNe Ia in metal-rich galaxies. Based on our previous results on
local SNe Ia, we propose this dependence to be due to the lower luminosity of
the SNe Ia produced in more metal-rich environments.

non-synchronous rotation magnetic effects, or partial cloud coverage, that
obscures the emergent flux from the planet's eastern hemisphere.
Non-synchronous rotation and magnetic effects may also explain the planet's

explain the featureless dayside emission spectrum of the planet. If CoRoT-2b is
not tidally locked, then it means that our understanding of star-planet tidal

be divided into two groups based on their star formation histories. So-called
fast-growing LRGs assemble $80\%$ of their stellar mass at $z\sim5$, whereas
slow-growing LRGs reach the same evolutionary state at $z\sim1.5$. We further
demonstrate that these two subpopulations present significantly different
clustering properties on scales of $\sim1 - 30 \mathrm{Mpc}$. Here, we measure
the mean halo mass of each subsample using the galaxy-galaxy lensing technique,
in the $\sim190\deg^2$ overlap of the LRG catalogue and the CS82 and CFHTLenS
shear catalogues. We show that fast- and slow-growing LRGs have similar lensing
profiles, which implies that they live in haloes of similar mass:
$\log\left(M_{\rm halo}^{\rm fast}/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\right) =
12.85^{+0.16}_{-0.26}$ and $\log\left(M_{\rm halo}^{\rm

combined with the clustering difference, suggests the existence of galaxy
assembly bias, although the effect is too subtle to be definitively proven
given the errors on our current weak-lensing measurement. We show that this can
soon be achieved with upcoming surveys like DES.

(0.04-0.07"") observations, at HCN J=3-2 and HCO+ J=3-2 lines, of the nucleus of
NGC 1068, the nearby prototypical type 2 active galactic nucleus (AGN). Our
previous ALMA observations identified the compact emission of these lines at
the putative location of the torus around a mass-accreting supermassive black
hole. We now report that we have detected the rotation of this compact
emission, with the eastern and western sides being redshifted and blueshifted,
respectively. Unlike the previously reported CO J=6-5 emission, both the
morphological and dynamical alignments of the HCN J=3-2 and HCO+ J=3-2 emission
are roughly aligned along the east-west direction (i.e., the expected torus
direction), suggesting that these molecular lines are better probes of a
rotating dense molecular gas component in the torus. The western part of the
torus exhibits larger velocity dispersion and stronger emission in the HCN
J=3-2 and HCO+ J=3-2 lines than the eastern part, revealing a highly
inhomogeneous molecular torus. The dense molecular gas in the torus and that of
the host galaxy at 0.5-2.0"" from the AGN along the torus direction are found to
be counter-rotating, suggesting an external process happened in the past at the
NGC 1068 nucleus.

conservation laws affect $q=0$ Pomeranchuk instabilities in a Fermi liquid. The
conventional view is that these instabilities are determined by the static
interaction between low-energy quasiparticles near the Fermi surface, in the
limit of vanishing momentum transfer $q$. The condition for a Pomeranchuk
instability is set by $F^{c(s)}_l =-1$, where $F^{c(s)}_l$ (a Landau parameter)
is a properly normalized partial component of the anti-symmetrized static
interaction $F(k,k+q; p,p-q)$ in a charge (c) or spin (s) sub-channel with
angular momentum $l$. However, it is known that conservation laws for total
spin and charge prevent Pomeranchuk instabilities for $l=1$ spin- and charge-
current order parameters. Our study aims to understand whether this holds only
for these special forms of $l=1$ order parameters, or is a more generic result.
To this end we perform a diagrammatic analysis of spin and charge
susceptibilities for charge and spin density order parameters, as well as
perturbative calculations to second order in the Hubbard $U$. We argue that for
$l=1$ spin-current and charge-current order parameters, certain vertex
functions, which are determined by high-energy fermions, vanish at
$F^{c(s)}_{l=1}=-1$, preventing a Pomeranchuk instability from taking place.
For an order parameter with a generic $l=1$ form-factor, the vertex function is
not expressed in terms of $F^{c(s)}_{l=1}$, and a Pomeranchuk instability does
occur when $F^{c(s)}_1=-1$. We argue that for other values of $l$, a
Pomeranchuk instability occurs at $F^{c(s)}_{l} =-1$ for an order parameter

determined by unknown cosmic rate density history [$\rhoFRB (z)$] and
luminosity function (LF) of the transient events. We predict the distributions
of DMs, flux densities, and fluences of FRBs taking account of the variation of
the receiver efficiency within its beam, using analytical models of $\rhoFRB
(z)$ and LF. Comparing the predictions with the observations, we show that the
cumulative distribution of apparent fluences suggests that FRBs originate at
cosmological distances and $\rhoFRB$ increases with redshift resembling cosmic
star formation history (CSFH). We also show that a LF model with a bright-end
cutoff at log$_{10}L_\nu$ [erg s$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1}$] $\sim$ 34 are favored to
reproduce the observed DM distribution if $\rhoFRB (z)\propto$ CSFH, although
the statistical significance of the constraints obtained with the current size
of the observed sample is not high. Finally, we find that the correlation
between DM and flux density of FRBs is potentially a powerful tool to
distinguish whether FRBs are at cosmological distances or in the local universe

to political and technical difficulties, it is neither practical nor feasible
to solve the multi-area coordination problem in a centralized fashion, which
requires full access to all data of individual areas. In comparison, in the
proposed fully-distributed approach, local NCUC problems of individual areas
can be solved independently, and only limited information is exchanged among
adjacent areas for facilitating multi-area coordination. Furthermore, as
traditional ADMM can only guarantee convergence for convex problems, this paper
discusses several strategies to mitigate oscillations, enhance convergence
performance, and derive good-enough feasible solutions, including: (i) A
tie-line power flow based area coordination strategy is designed to reduce the
number of global consensus variables; (ii) Different penalty parameters \r{ho}
are assigned to individual consensus variables and are updated via certain
rules during the iterative procedure, which would reduce the impact of initial
values of \r{ho} on convergence performance; (iii) Heuristic rules are adopted
to fix certain unit commitment variables for avoiding oscillations during the
iterative procedure; and (iv) An asynchronous distributed strategy is studied,
which solves NCUC subproblems of small areas multiple times and exchanges
information with adjacent areas more frequently within one complete run of
slower NCUC subproblems of large areas. Numerical cases illustrate
effectiveness of the proposed asynchronous fully-distributed NCUC approach, and
investigate key factors that would affect its convergence performance.

empirical process of Hessians of the Frechet function converges suitably, as in
the proof of the prototypical BP-CLT (Bhattacharya and Patrangenaru (2005)).
This is not valid in many realistic scenarios and we provide for a new very
general CLT. In particular this includes scenarios where, in a suitable chart,
the sample mean fluctuates asymptotically at a scale $n^{\alpha}$ with
exponents ${\alpha} < 1/2$ with a non-normal distribution. As the BP-CLT yields
only fluctuations that are, rescaled with $n^{1/2}$ , asymptotically normal,
just as the classical CLT for random vectors, these lower rates, somewhat
loosely called smeariness, had to date been observed only on the circle (Hotz
and Huckemann (2015)). We make the concept of smeariness on manifolds precise,
give an example for two-smeariness on spheres of arbitrary dimension, and show
that smeariness, although ""almost never"" occurring, may have serious
statistical implications on a continuum of sample scenarios nearby. In fact,
this effect increases with dimension, striking in particular in high dimension
low sample size scenarios.

  using partial mutual unbiased basis of photon's orbital angular momentum","Comments are welcome",,,,"quant-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) guarantees the security of communication with
quantum physics. Most of widely adopted QKD protocols currently encode the key
information with binary signal format---qubit, such as the polarization states.
Therefore the transmitted information efficiency of the quantum key is
intrinsically upper bounded by 1 bit per photon. High dimensional quantum
system is a potential candidate for increasing the capacity of single photon.
However, due to the difficulty in manipulating and measuring high dimensional
quantum systems, the experimental high dimensional QKD is still at its infancy.
Here we propose a sort of practical high-speed high dimensional QKD using
partial mutual unbiased basis (PMUB) of photon's orbital angular momentum
(OAM). Different from the previous OAM encoding, the high dimensional Hilbert
space we used is expanded by the OAM states with same mode order, which can be
extended to considerably high dimensions and implemented under current state of
the art. Because all the OAM states are in the same mode order, the coherence
will be well kept after long-distance propagation, and the detection can be
achieved by using passive linear optical elements with very high speed. We show
that our protocol has high key generation rate and analyze the anti-noise
ability under atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore, the security of our protocol
based on PMUB is rigorously proved. Our protocol paves a brand new way for the
application of photon's OAM in high dimensional QKD field, which can be a
breakthrough for high efficiency quantum communications.

reasons. Here, we consider advanced coupled-cluster and multi-configurational
approaches to reinvestigate our WCCR10 set of ten gas-phase ligand dissociation
energies. We assess the potential multi-configurational character of all
molecules involved in these reactions in order to determine where
single-reference coupled-cluster approaches can be applied. For some reactions
of the WCCR10 set, large deviations from density-functional results including
semiclassical dispersion corrections from experimental reference data had been
observed. We tackle the issue (i) by comparing to ab initio data that comprise
dispersion effects on a rigorous first-principles footing and (ii) by a
comparison of density-functional approaches that model dispersion interactions
in various ways. Only for two reactions, species exhibiting nonnegligible
static electron correlation were identified, and hence, we may choose standard
single-reference coupled-cluster approaches to compare with density-functional
methods for the other eight reactions. For WCCR10, the Minnesota M06-L
functional yielded the smallest mean absolute deviation without additional
dispersion corrections in comparison to the coupled-cluster results and the
PBE0-D3 functional produced the overall smallest mean absolute deviation. The
agreement of density-functional results with coupled-cluster data increases
significantly upon inclusion of any type of dispersion correction. It is
important to emphasize that different density-functional schemes available for
this purpose perform equally well. The coupled-cluster dissociation energies,
however, deviate significantly from experimental results.

The equations describe an equilibrium, area-preserving tangential flow of a

of shape-regular tetrahedra. Thus, there is no need for surface parametrization

bulk finite elements for both the velocity and the pressure. In order to
enforce the velocity vector field to be tangential to the surface we introduce
a penalty term. The method is straightforward to implement and has an $O(h^2)$
geometric consistency error, which is of the same order as the approximation
error due to the $P_1$--$P_1$ pair for velocity and pressure. We prove
stability and optimal order discretization error bounds in the surface $H^1$

solver for the equations of compressible ideal, viscous and resistive
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The new method is conservative for mass, momentum
and total energy and in multiple space dimensions it is constructed in such a
way as to respect the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field exactly,
also in the presence of resistive effects. This is possible via the use of
multi-dimensional Riemann solvers on an appropriately staggered grid for the
time evolution of the magnetic field and a double curl formulation of the
resistive terms. The new semi-implicit method for the MHD equations proposed
here discretizes all terms related to the pressure in the momentum equation and
the total energy equation implicitly, making again use of a properly staggered
grid for pressure and velocity. The time step of the scheme is restricted by a
CFL condition based only on the fluid velocity and the Alfv\'en wave speed and
is not based on the speed of the magnetosonic waves. Our new method is
particularly well-suited for low Mach number flows and for the incompressible
limit of the MHD equations, for which it is well-known that explicit
density-based Godunov-type finite volume solvers become increasingly
inefficient and inaccurate due to the increasingly stringent CFL condition and
the wrong scaling of the numerical viscosity in the incompressible limit. We
show a relevant MHD test problem in the low Mach number regime where the new
semi-implicit algorithm is a factor of 50 faster than a traditional explicit
finite volume method, which is a very significant gain in terms of
computational efficiency. However, our numerical results confirm that our new
method performs well also for classical MHD test cases with strong shocks. In
this sense our new scheme is a true all Mach number flow solver.

Recent engineering solutions have attempted to exploit the efficacy of deep
learning (DL) models initially targeted for image classification to deal with
FG pixel labelling. One major drawback of such strategy is the lacking
delineation of visual objects when training samples are limited. To grapple
with this issue, we introduce a multi-view receptive field fully convolutional
neural network (MV-FCN) that harness recent seminal ideas, such as, fully
convolutional structure, inception modules, and residual networking. Therefrom,
we implement a system in an encoder-decoder fashion that subsumes a core and
two complementary feature flow paths. The model exploits inception modules at
early and late stages with three different sizes of receptive fields to capture
invariance at various scales. The features learned in the encoding phase are
fused with appropriate feature maps in the decoding phase through residual
connections for achieving enhanced spatial representation. These multi-view
receptive fields and residual feature connections are expected to yield highly
generalized features for an accurate pixel-wise FG region identification. It
is, then, trained with database specific exemplary segmentations to predict
desired FG objects.
  The comparative experimental results on eleven benchmark datasets validate
that the proposed model achieves very competitive performance with the prior-
and state-of-the-art algorithms. We also report that how well a transfer
learning approach can be useful to enhance the performance of our proposed
MV-FCN.

performance gap between the quantum limit and that of ideal continuum
image-plane direct detection is the largest for highly sub-Rayleigh separation
of the objects, and that a pre-detection mode sorting could attain the quantum
limit. Here we extend this to a more general problem of estimating the length
of an incoherently radiating extended (line) object. We find, as expected by
the Rayleigh criterion, the Fisher information (FI) per integrated photon
vanishes in the limit of small length for ideal image plane direct detection.
Conversely, for a Hermite-Gaussian (HG) pre-detection mode sorter, this
normalized FI does not decrease with decreasing object length, similar to the
two point object case. However, unlike in the two-object problem, the FI per
photon of both detection strategies gradually decreases as the object length
greatly exceeds the Rayleigh limit, due to the relative inefficiency of
information provided by photons emanating from near the center of the object
about its length. We evaluate the quantum Fisher information per unit
integrated photons and find that the HG mode sorter exactly achieves this limit
at all values of the object length. Further, a simple binary mode sorter
maintains the advantage of the full mode sorter at highly sub-Rayleigh length.
In addition to this FI analysis, we quantify improvement in terms of the actual
mean squared error of the length estimate. Finally, we consider the effect of
imperfect mode sorting, and show that the performance improvement over direct
detection is robust over a range of sub-Rayleigh lengths.

magnitude increases in mobile data rates, with compact antenna arrays providing
narrow steerable beams for unprecedented levels of spatial reuse. A fundamental
technical bottleneck, however, is rapid spatial channel estimation and beam
adaptation in the face of mobility and blockage. Recently proposed compressive
techniques which exploit the sparsity of mm wave channels are a promising
approach to this problem, with overhead scaling linearly with the number of
dominant paths and logarithmically with the number of array elements. Further,
they can be implemented with RF beamforming with low-precision phase control.
However, these methods make implicit assumptions on long-term phase coherence
that are not satisfied by existing hardware. In this paper, we propose and
evaluate a noncoherent compressive channel estimation technique which can
estimate a sparse spatial channel based on received signal strength (RSS)
alone, and is compatible with off-the-shelf hardware. The approach is based on
cascading phase retrieval (i.e., recovery of complex-valued measurements from
RSS measurements, up to a scalar multiple) with coherent compressive
estimation. While a conventional cascade scheme would multiply two measurement
matrices to obtain an overall matrix whose entries are in a continuum, a key
novelty in our scheme is that we constrain the overall measurement matrix to be
implementable using coarsely quantized pseudorandom phases, employing a virtual
decomposition of the matrix into a product of measurement matrices for phase
retrieval and compressive estimation. Theoretical and simulation results show
that our noncoherent method scales almost as well with array size as its
coherent counterpart, thus inheriting the scalability and low overhead of the
latter.

an initial estimate of the true signal which must be externally provided. In
this paper, we investigate the required number of measurements for exact

multiple descriptions automatically according to image's content, which are
compressed by standard codec. Secondly, we present multiple description
reconstruction network (MDRN) including side reconstruction network (SRN) and
central reconstruction network (CRN). When any one of two lossy descriptions is
received at the decoder, SRN network is used to improve the quality of this
decoded lossy description by removing the compression artifact and up-sampling
simultaneously. Meanwhile, we utilize CRN network with two decoded descriptions
as inputs for better reconstruction, if both of lossy descriptions are
available. Thirdly, multiple description virtual codec network (MDVCN) is
proposed to bridge the gap between MDGN network and MDRN network in order to
train an end-to-end MDC framework. Here, two learning algorithms are provided
to train our whole framework. In addition to structural similarity loss
function, the produced descriptions are used as opposing labels with multiple
description distance loss function to regularize the training of MDGN network.
These losses guarantee that the generated description images are structurally
similar yet finely diverse. Experimental results show a great deal of objective
and subjective quality measurements to validate the efficiency of the proposed
method.

involving mass-momentum-energy transport phenomena. Thermal fluid simulation
(TFS) is based on solving conservative equations, for which - except for
""first-principle"" direct numerical simulation - closure relations (CRs) are
required to provide microscopic interactions. In practice, TFS is realized
through reduced-order modeling, and its CRs can be informed by observations and
data from relevant and adequately evaluated experiments and high-fidelity
simulations. This paper focuses on data-driven TFS models, specifically on the
development using machine learning (ML). Five ML frameworks, dubbed Type I to
V, are introduced. The frameworks vary in their performance for different
applications depending on the level of knowledge of governing physics, the
source, type, amount and quality of available data for training. Notably,
outlined for the first time in this paper, Type III models present stringent
requirements on modeling, substantial computing resources for training, and
high potential in extracting value from ""big data"" in thermal fluid research.
The paper demonstrates the ML frameworks by three examples. First, we utilize
the heat diffusion equation with nonlinear conductivity formulated by
convolutional neural networks to illustrate the applications of Type I, II, and
III ML. The results indicate a preference for Type II ML under deficient data
support. Type III ML can effectively utilize field data, potentially generating
more robust predictions than Type I and II ML. Second, we illustrate how to
employ Type I ML and Type II ML frameworks for data-driven turbulence modeling
using reference works. Third, we demonstrate Type I ML by building a deep
learning (DL)-based slip closure for two-phase flow modeling. The results showe
that the DL-based closure exhibits a bounded error in prediction domain.

in the SAMI Galaxy Survey sample, we investigate the comparative influences of
environment and intrinsic properties of galaxies on perturbation. We use
spatially resolved H$\alpha$ velocity fields from the SAMI Galaxy Survey to
quantify kinematic asymmetry ($\overline{v_{asym}}$) in nearby galaxies and
environmental and stellar mass data from the GAMA survey.
  {We find that local environment, measured as distance to nearest neighbour,
is inversely correlated with kinematic asymmetry for galaxies with
$\mathrm{\log(M_*/M_\odot)}>10.0$, but there is no significant correlation for
galaxies with $\mathrm{\log(M_*/M_\odot)}<10.0$. Moreover, low mass galaxies
($\mathrm{\log(M_*/M_\odot)}<9.0$) have greater kinematic asymmetry at all
separations, suggesting a different physical source of asymmetry is important
in low mass galaxies.}
  We propose that secular effects derived from gas fraction and gas mass may be
the primary causes of asymmetry in low mass galaxies. High gas fraction is
linked to high $\frac{\sigma_{m}}{V}$ (where $\sigma_m$ is H$\alpha$ velocity
dispersion and $V$ the rotation velocity), which is strongly correlated with
$\overline{v_{asym}}$, and galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_\odot)<9.0$ have offset
$\overline{\frac{\sigma_{m}}{V}}$ from the rest of the sample. Further,
asymmetry as a fraction of dispersion decreases for galaxies with
$\log(M_*/M_\odot)<9.0$. Gas mass and asymmetry are also inversely correlated
in our sample. We propose that low gas masses in dwarf galaxies may lead to
asymmetric distribution of gas clouds, leading to increased relative
turbulence.

in the bulk, which is lifted at the boundary leading to a splitting into two
chiral edge modes. It has long been theoretically predicted that the splitting
of the zero-energy Landau level inside the {\it bulk} can lead to many
interesting physics, such as quantum spin Hall effect, Dirac like singular
points of the chiral edge modes, and others. However, so far the obtained
splitting with high-magnetic field even on a hBN substrate are not amenable to
experimental detection, and functionality. Guided by theoretical calculations,
here we produce a large gap zero-energy Landau level splitting ($\sim$ 150 meV)
with the usage of a one-dimensional (1D) superlattice potential. We have
created tunable 1D superlattice in a hBN encapsulated graphene device using an
array of metal gates with a period of $\sim$ 100 nm. The Landau level spectrum
is visualized by measuring magneto capacitance spectroscopy. We monitor the
splitting of the zeroth Landau level as a function of superlattice potential.
The observed splitting energy is an order higher in magnitude compared to the
previous studies of splitting due to the symmetry breaking in pristine
graphene. The origin of such large Landau level spitting in 1D potential is
explained with a degenerate perturbation theory. We find that owing to the
periodic potential, the Landau level becomes dispersive, and acquires sharp
peaks at the tunable band edges. Our study will pave the way to create the
tunable 1D periodic structure for multi-functionalization and device
application like graphene electronic circuits from appropriately engineered
periodic patterns in near future.

solves for each spectral signature a unique transformation so that the non

How can we automatically uncover the underlying laws of physics from

Specifically, we approximate the unknown solution as well as the nonlinear

represents the nonlinear dynamics and helps us distill the mechanisms that

observed on the northwestern limb of the solar disk on July 24th, 2016. The
entire dynamic evolutionary process starting from its onset is consistent with
a loop-loop interaction scenario. The X-ray profiles manifest an intriguing
double-peak feature. From spectral fitting, it is found that the first peak is
non-thermally dominated while the second peak is mostly multi-thermal with a
hot (~10 MK) and a super-hot (~30 MK) component. This double-peak feature is
unique in that the two peaks are clearly separated by 4 minutes, and the second
peak reaches up to 25-50 keV; in addition, at energy bands above 3 keV the
X-ray fluxes decline significantly between the two peaks. This, together with
other available imaging and spectral data, manifest a two-stage energy release
process. A comprehensive analysis is carried out to investigate the nature of
this two-stage process. We conclude that the second stage with the hot and
super-hot sources mainly involves direct heating through loop-loop reconnection
at a relatively high altitude in the corona. The uniqueness of the event
characteristics and complete data set make the study a nice addition to present
literature on solar flares.

the solid matrix causes two simultaneous, competing effects: pore enlargement
(chemical deformation), and pore compaction due to mechanical weakening. A
novel, mechanistic pore-scale model simulates flooding of a sample under fixed
confining stress, showing that increasing stress inhibits permeability
enhancement, increasing the injected volume required to reach a certain
permeability, in agreement with recent experiments. We explain this behavior by
stress concentration downstream, in the less dissolved (hence stiffer) region.
As this region is also less conductive, even its small compaction has a strong
bottleneck effect that curbs the permeability.
  Our results also elucidate that the impact of stress depends on the
dissolution regime. Under wormholing conditions (slow injection, i.e. high
Damkohler, $Da$), the development of a sharp dissolution front and high
porosity contrast accentuates the bottleneck effect. This reduces transport
heterogeneity, promoting wormhole competition. Once the outlet starts eroding,
the extreme focusing of transport and hence dissolution--characteristic of
wormholing--becomes dominant, diminishing the bottleneck effect and hence the
impact of stress. In contrast, at low $Da$, incomplete reaction upstream allows
the reagent to traverse the sample, causing a more uniform dissolution. The
continuous dissolution and its partial counteraction by compaction downstream
provides a steady, gradual increase in the effect of stress. Consequently, the
impact of stress is more pronounced at high $Da$ during early stages (low
permeability), and at low $Da$ close to breakthrough. Our work promotes
understanding of the hydromechanical property evolution, with important
implications for processes ranging from diagenesis and weathering of rocks, to
well stimulation and carbon geosequetration.

can be used to hitherto relatively unexplored areas of vesicle deformation and

cross over from the entropic to enthalpic (stretching) tension during vesicle
deformation. A lucid demonstration of this concept is provided by the study of
vesicle deformation and dielectrophoresis under axisymmetric quadrupole
electric field. Small deformation theory incorporating the Maxwell stress
approach is used (employing area and volume conservation constraints) to
estimate the dielectrophoretic velocity. The entropic and enthalpic tensions
are implemented to understand vesicle electrohydrodynamics in low and high
tension limits. The shapes obtained using the entropic and the enthalpic
approaches, show significant differences. A strong dependence of the final
vesicle shapes on the ratio of electrical conductivities of the fluids inside

electric field is observed which could be used to estimate electromechanical
properties of the vesicle. Moreover, an excess area dependent transition
between the entropic and enthalpic regimes is observed. The Maxwell stress
approach, used in this work, indicates that Clausius-Mossotti factor obtained
by the dipole moment method together with the drag on a rigid sphere explains
vesicle dielectrophoresis. Interestingly, the coupling of hydrodynamic and

to generate long memory due to the existence of efficient algorithms for their
simulation and forecasting. Nonetheless, there is no theoretical argument
linking the fractional difference operator with the presence of long memory in
real data. In this regard, one of the most predominant theoretical explanations
for the presence of long memory is cross-sectional aggregation of persistent
micro units. Yet, the type of processes obtained by cross-sectional aggregation
differs from the one due to fractional differencing. Thus, this paper develops
fast algorithms to generate and forecast long memory by cross-sectional
aggregation. Moreover, it is shown that the antipersistent phenomenon that
arises for negative degrees of memory in the fractional difference literature
is not present for cross-sectionally aggregated processes. Pointedly, while the
autocorrelations for the fractional difference operator are negative for
negative degrees of memory by construction, this restriction does not apply to
the cross-sectional aggregated scheme. We show that this has implications for
long memory tests in the frequency domain, which will be misspecified for
cross-sectionally aggregated processes with negative degrees of memory.
Finally, we assess the forecast performance of high-order $AR$ and $ARFIMA$
models when the long memory series are generated by cross-sectional
aggregation. Our results are of interest to practitioners developing forecasts

system emerging from a quantum dynamics is highly desirable, in order to
understand what $\mathcal {PT}$-symmetry and the powerful mathematical and
physical concepts around it will bring to the next generation of quantum
technologies. Here, we address this need by proposing and studying a
circuit-QED architecture that consists of two coupled resonators and two qubits
(each coupled to one resonator). By means of external driving fields on the
qubits, we are able to tune gain and losses in the resonators. Starting with
the quantum dynamics of this system, we show the emergence of the $\mathcal
{PT}$-symmetry via the selection of both driving amplitudes and frequencies. We
engineer the system such that a non-number conserving dipole-dipole interaction
emerges, introducing an instability at large coupling strengths. The $\mathcal
{PT}$-symmetry and its breaking, as well as the predicted instability in this
circuit-QED system can be observed in a transmission experiment.

  Wireless-Powered IoT Devices","Submitted to IEEE Trans. Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a new spectrum sharing model referred to as riding on the
primary (ROP) is proposed for wireless-powered IoT devices with ambient
backscatter communication capabilities. The key idea of ROP is that the
secondary transmitter harvests energy from the primary signal, then modulates
its information bits to the primary signal, and reflects the modulated signal
to the secondary receiver without violating the primary system's interference
requirement. Compared with the conventional spectrum sharing model, the
secondary system in the proposed ROP not only utilizes the spectrum of the
primary system but also takes advantage of the primary signal to harvest energy
and to carry its information. In this paper, we investigate the performance of
such a spectrum sharing system under fading channels. To be specific, we
maximize the ergodic capacity of the secondary system by jointly optimizing the
transmit power of the primary signal and the reflection coefficient of the
secondary ambient backscatter. Different (ideal/practical) energy consumption
models, different (peak/average) transmit power constraints, different types
(fixed/dynamically adjustable) reflection coefficient, different primary
system's interference requirements (rate/outage) are considered. Optimal power
allocation and reflection coefficient are obtained for each scenario.

applied in the forthcoming fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, due to its
many advantages such as low cost, high mobility, and on-demand deployment.
However, the broadcast and line-of-sight (LoS) nature of air-to-ground wireless
channels gives rise to a new challenge on how to realize secure UAV
communications with the destined nodes on the ground. This paper aims to tackle
this challenge by applying the physical layer security technique. We consider
both the downlink and uplink UAV communications with a ground node, namely
UAV-to-ground (U2G) and ground-to-UAV (G2U) communications, respectively,
subject to a potential eavesdropper on the ground. In contrast to the existing
literature on wireless physical layer security only with ground nodes at fixed
or quasi-static locations, we exploit the high mobility of the UAV to
proactively establish favorable and degraded channels for the legitimate and
eavesdropping links, respectively, via its trajectory design. We formulate new
problems to maximize the average secrecy rates of the U2G and G2U
transmissions, respectively, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and the
transmit power of the legitimate transmitter over a given flight period of the
UAV. Although the formulated problems are non-convex, we propose iterative
algorithms to solve them efficiently by applying the block coordinate descent
and successive convex optimization methods. Specifically, the transmit power
and UAV trajectory are each optimized with the other being fixed in an
alternating manner, until the algorithms converge. Simulation results show that
the proposed algorithms can improve the secrecy rates for both U2G and G2U
communications, as compared to other benchmark schemes without power control

challenge, let alone detecting a target as small as one or a few pixels and
tracking it in flight. In the fly's visual system, a class of specific neurons,
called small target motion detectors (STMDs), have been identified as showing
exquisite selectivity for small target motion. Some of the STMDs have also
demonstrated directional selectivity which means these STMDs respond strongly
only to their preferred motion direction. Directional selectivity is an
important property of these STMD neurons which could contribute to tracking
small targets such as mates in flight. However, little has been done on
systematically modeling these directional selective STMD neurons. In this
paper, we propose a directional selective STMD-based neural network (DSTMD) for
small target detection in a cluttered background. In the proposed neural
network, a new correlation mechanism is introduced for direction selectivity
via correlating signals relayed from two pixels. Then, a lateral inhibition
mechanism is implemented on the spatial field for size selectivity of STMD
neurons. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed neural network not only
is in accord with current biological findings, i.e. showing directional
preferences, but also worked reliably in detecting small targets against

subjected to simultaneous shear and uniform AC electric field is investigated
in the small deformation limit. The coupled equations for vesicle orientation
and shape evolution are derived theoretically and the resulting nonlinear
equations are handled numerically to generate relevant phase diagrams that
demonstrate the effect of electrical parameters on the different dynamical
regimes such as tank-treading (TT), trembling (TR), and tumbling (TU). It is
found that while the electric Mason number (Mn) which represents the relative
strength of the electrical forces to the shear forces, promotes TT regime, the
response itself is found to be sensitive to the applied frequency as well as
the conductivity ratio. While higher outer conductivity promotes orientation
along the flow axis, orientation along the electric field is favoured when the
inner conductivity is higher. Similarly, a switch of orientation from the
direction of the electric field to the direction of flow is possible by a mere
change of frequency when the outer conductivity is higher. Interestingly, in
some cases, a coupling between electric field induced deformation and shear can
result in the system admitting an intermediate TU regime while attaining the TT
regime at high Mn. The results could enable designing better dielectrophoretic
devices wherein the residence time, as well as the dynamical states of the
vesicular suspension, can be controlled as per the application.

Hierarchical Q-Network (HQN) motivated by theories of the hierarchical
organization of the human prefrontal cortex, that attempts to identify lower

an internal model of rules in simple environments. We draw on combinatorial
games, where there exists a single optimal strategy for winning that
generalizes across other features of the game, to probe the strategy
generalization of the HQN and other reinforcement learning (RL) agents using
variations of Wythoff's game. Traditional RL approaches failed to reach
satisfactory performance on variants of Wythoff's Game; however, the HQN
learned heuristic-like strategies that generalized across changes in board

the agent's internal model of the game following training. Our results show how
a biologically inspired hierarchical learner can facilitate learning abstract

presence of missing values. We apply this framework to the task of UV
completion which is widely used in pose-invariant face recognition. Moreover,
we construct a generative adversarial network (GAN) to extract side information
as well as subspaces. These subspaces not only assist in the recovery but also
speed up the process in case of large-scale data. We quantitatively and
qualitatively evaluate the proposed approaches through both synthetic data and
five real-world datasets to verify their effectiveness.

dust ion acoustic solitary structures at the acoustic speed in a collisionless
unmagnetized dusty plasma consisting of negatively charged static dust grains,
adiabatic warm ions, nonthermal electrons and isothermal positrons. The present
system supports both positive and negative potential solitary waves at the
acoustic speed, but the system does not support the coexistence of solitary
structures of opposite polarity at the acoustic speed. The system also supports
negative potential double layer at the acoustic speed, but does not support
positive potential double layer. Although the system supports positive
potential supersoliton at the supersonic speed, but there does not exist
supersoliton of any polarity at the acoustic speed. Solitary structures have
been investigated with the help of compositional parameter spaces and the phase
portraits of the dynamical system describing the nonlinear behaviour of the
dust ion acoustic waves at the acoustic speed. For the case, when there is no
positron in the system, there exist negative potential double layer and
negative potential supersoliton at the acoustic speed and for such case, the
mechanism of transition of supersoliton to soliton after the formation of
double layer at the acoustic speed has been discussed with the help of phase
portraits. The differences between the solitary structures at the acoustic

with the help of phase portraits.

  Intersection Connected to Freeway On-Ramp",,,,,"cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Unlike most existing studies on off-ramp traffic signal control, this paper
focuses on the optimization problem of the signalized intersection connected to
freeway on-ramps. Conflicts are often observed between the traffic heading to
an on-ramp and the traffic continuing straight which leads to issues such as
intersection overflow, increased delay, and concerns about safety. For studying
this problem, a real-world signalized intersection in Buffalo, New York was
chosen, which has two through lanes and one short shared (through and
right-turn) lane. At the downstream of the intersection are two following
on-ramps, one to the highway I-290 West and the other to I-290 East. During
peak hours, the shared lane often observes a long queue, which furthermore
blocks the through traffic on the parallel lane. To solve this problem, a
VISSIM agent-based simulation model was built and calibrated based on field
observations. Three potential optimization solutions were proposed and tested
with the help of VISSIM: (1) increasing the length of the short shared through
and right-turn lane; (2) making the short shared through and right-turn lane
right-turn only, and (3) adding a new diverge lane for the right-turn vehicles.
According to the simulation results, solution (3) performs the best, resulting
in the least vehicle delay time.

processes that guide neuronal networks to reach or maintain criticality remain
unclear. The present research examines the role of neuronal gain plasticity in
time-series of simulated neuronal networks composed of integrate-and-fire
stochastic spiking neurons, and the utility of fractal methods in assessing
network criticality. Simulated time-series were derived from a network model of
fully connected discrete-time stochastic excitable neurons. Monofractal and
multifractal analyses were applied to neuronal gain time-series. Fractal
scaling was greatest in networks with a mid-range of neuronal plasticity,
versus extremely high or low levels of plasticity. Peak fractal scaling
corresponded closely to additional indices of criticality, including average
branching ratio. Networks exhibited multifractal structure, or multiple scaling
relationships. Multifractal spectra around peak criticality exhibited elongated
right tails, suggesting that the fractal structure is relatively insensitive to
high-amplitude local fluctuations. Networks near critical states exhibited
mid-range multifractal spectra width and tail length, which is consistent with
literature suggesting that networks poised at quasi-critical states must be
stable enough to maintain organization but unstable enough to be adaptable.
Lastly, fractal analyses may offer additional information about critical state
dynamics of networks by indicating scales of influence as networks approach
critical states.

fluids. However, an unambiguous and universally-accepted definition for vortex
is yet to be achieved in the field of fluid mechanics, which is probably one of
the major obstacles causing considerable confusions and misunderstandings in
turbulence research. In our previous work, a new vector quantity which is
called vortex vector was proposed to accurately describe the local fluid
rotation and clearly display vortical structures. In this paper, the definition
of the vortex vector, named Rortex here, is revisited from the mathematical
perspective. The existence of the rotational axis is proved through real Schur
decomposition. Based on real Schur decomposition, a fast algorithm for
calculating Rortex is also presented. In addition, new vorticity tensor and
vector decompositions are introduced: the vorticity tensor is decomposed to a
rigidly rotational part and an anti-symmetric deformation part, and the
vorticity vector is decomposed to a rigidly rotational vector and a
non-rotational vector. Several cases, including 2D Couette flow, 2D rigid
rotational flow and 3D boundary layer transition on a flat plate, are studied
to demonstrate the justification of the definition of Rortex. It can be
observed that Rortex identifies both the precise swirling strength and the
rotational axis, and thus it can reasonably represent the local fluid rotation
and provide a new powerful tool for vortex dynamics and turbulence research.
