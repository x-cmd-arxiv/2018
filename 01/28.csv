social media site such as Flickr often has meaningful, associated information,
such as comments and other images the user has uploaded, that is complementary
to pixel content and helpful in predicting labels. Prediction challenges such

Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework, where each node is an image, and
consists of two deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and one Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) that model both textual and visual node/image information.
The edge weights of the CRF graph represent textual similarity and link-based
metadata such as user sets and image groups. We model the CRF as an RNN for
both learning and inference, and incorporate the weighted ranking loss and
cross entropy loss into the CRF parameter optimization to handle the training
data imbalance issue. Our proposed approach is evaluated on the MIR-9K dataset

energy-limited devices first harvest energy in the downlink and then transmit
information in the uplink, have been envisioned as a promising solution for the
future Internet-of-Things (IoT). Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) has been proposed to improve the system spectral efficiency (SE) of the
fifth-generation (5G) networks by allowing concurrent transmissions of multiple
users in the same spectrum. As such, NOMA has been recently considered for the
uplink of WPCNs based IoT networks with a massive number of devices. However,
simultaneous transmissions in NOMA may also incur more transmit energy
consumption as well as circuit energy consumption in practice which is critical
for energy constrained IoT devices. As a result, compared to orthogonal
multiple access schemes such as time-division multiple access (TDMA), whether
the SE can be improved and/or the total energy consumption can be reduced with
NOMA in such a scenario still remains unknown. To answer this question, we
first derive the optimal time allocations for maximizing the SE of a TDMA-based
WPCN (T-WPCN) and a NOMA-based WPCN (N-WPCN), respectively. Subsequently, we
analyze the total energy consumption as well as the maximum SE achieved by
these two networks. Surprisingly, it is found that N-WPCN not only consumes
more energy, but also is less spectral efficient than T-WPCN. Simulation
results verify our theoretical findings and unveil the fundamental performance
bottleneck, i.e., ""worst user bottleneck problem"", in multiuser NOMA systems.

parameters (such as mass density and Young's modulus) of the materials and/or

knowledge and computational experience concerning so-called optimal approximate
designs of experiments. However, for an approximate design to be executed in
practice, it must be converted into an exact, i.e., integer, design, which is
usually done via rounding procedures. Although rapid, rounding procedures have
many drawbacks; in particular, they often yield worse exact designs than
heuristics that do not require approximate designs at all.
  In this paper, we build on an alternative principle of utilizing optimal
approximate designs for the computation of optimal, or nearly-optimal, exact
designs. The principle, which we call ascent with quadratic assistance (AQuA),
is an integer programming method based on the quadratic approximation of the
design criterion in the neighborhood of the optimal approximate information
matrix.
  To this end, we present quadratic approximations of all Kiefer's criteria
with an integer parameter, including D- and A-optimality and, by a model
transformation, I-optimality. Importantly, we prove a low-rank property of the
associated quadratic forms, which enables us to apply AQuA to large design
spaces, for example via mixed integer conic quadratic solvers. We numerically
demonstrate the robustness and superior performance of the proposed method for
models under various types of constraints. More precisely, we compute optimal
size-constrained exact designs for the model of spring-balance weighing, and
optimal symmetric marginally restricted exact designs for the Scheffe mixture
model. We also show how can iterative application of AQuA be used for a
stratified information-based subsampling of large datasets under a lower bound
on the quality and an upper bound on the cost of the subsample.

good quality results in various image processing tasks. Dictionary learning
algorithms have made it possible to engineer data adaptive dictionaries which
have promising applications in image compression and image enhancement. The
most common sparse dictionary learning algorithms use the techniques of
matching pursuit and K-SVD iteratively for sparse coding and dictionary
learning respectively. While this technique produces good results, it requires
a large number of iterations to converge to an optimal solution. In this
article, we use a closed form stabilized convex optimization technique for both
sparse coding and dictionary learning. The approach results in providing the
best possible dictionary and the sparsest representation resulting in minimum
reconstruction error. Once the image is reconstructed from the compressively
sensed samples, we use adaptive frequency and spatial filtering techniques to
move towards exact image recovery. It is clearly seen from the results that the
proposed algorithm provides much better reconstruction results than
conventional sparse dictionary techniques for a fixed number of iterations.
Depending inversely upon the number of details present in the image, the
proposed algorithm reaches the optimal solution with a significantly lower
number of iterations. Consequently, high PSNR and low MSE is obtained using the
proposed algorithm for our compressive sensing framework.

characterize each source of hard X-ray emission. The method permits a
quantitative determination of the most likely number of subsources present, and
of the relative probabilities that the hard X-ray emission in a given subregion

simpler single source. We apply the method to a well-studied flare on

chromospheric footpoint sources present, and hence to the complexity of the
underlying magnetic geometry/toplogy. Contrary to previous claims of the need
for multiple sources to account for the chromospheric hard X-ray emission at
different locations and times, we find that a simple
two-footpoint-plus-coronal-source model is the most probable explanation for

sources: the sun and the Earth's internal energy. The motion of tectonic
plates, volcanism, mountain building and the reshaping of our planet's surface
over geologic time depend on the Earth's internal energy. Tectonic activity is
driven by internal energy and affects the rate at which energy is tapped, i.e.,
the cooling rate of our planet. Petrologic data indicate that cooling did not
occur at a constant rate over geologic history. Interior cooling was mild until
~2.5 billion years ago and then increased (Figure 1). As the Earth cools, it
cycles water between its rocky interior (crust and mantle) and its surface.
Water affects the viscosity of mantle rock, which affects the pace of tectonics
and, by association, Earth cooling. We present suites of thermal-tectonic
history models, coupled to deep water cycling, to show that the petrologically
constrained change in the Earth's cooling rate can be accounted for by
variations in deep water cycling over geologic time. The change in cooling rate
does not require a change in the global tectonic mode of the Earth. It can be
accounted for by a change in the balance of water cycling between the Earth's
interior and its surface envelopes. The nature and timing of that water cycling
change can be correlated to a change in the nature of continental crust and an
associated rise of atmospheric oxygen. The prediction that the rise of oxygen
should then be correlated, in time, to the change in the Earth's cooling rate
is consistent with data constraints.

surface composition of Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). In general, these
spectra are difficult to interpret due to the low apparent brightness of the
TNOs, causing low signal-to-noise ratio even in spectra obtained with the
largest telescopes available on the Earth, making necessary to use filtering
techniques to analyze and interpret them.
  The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology to analyze the spectra
of TNOs. Specifically, we aim at filtering these spectra in the best possible
way: maximizing the remotion of noise, while minimizing the loss of signal. We
use wavelets to filter the spectra. The wavelets are a mathematical tool that
decomposes the signal into its constituent parts, allowing to analyze the data
in different areas of frequencies with the resolution of each component tied to
its scale. To check the reliability of our method, we compare the filtered
spectra with spectra of water and methanol ices to identify some common
structures between them.
  Of the 50 TNOs of our sample, we identify traces of the presence of water
ices and methanol in the spectra of several of them, some with previous
reports, while for other objects there were no previous reports. We conclude
that the wavelet technique is successful in filtering spectra of TNOs.

  Extended Formulations",,,,,"math.OC math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Total dual integrality is a powerful and unifying concept in polyhedral
combinatorics and integer programming that enables the refinement of geometric
min-max relations given by linear programming Strong Duality into combinatorial
min-max theorems. The definition of total dual integrality (TDI) revolves
around the existence of optimal dual solutions that are integral, and thus
naturally applies to a host of combinatorial optimization problems that are
cast as integer programs whose LP relaxations have the TDIness property.
However, when combinatorial problems are formulated using more general convex
relaxations, such as semidefinite programs (SDPs), it is not at all clear what
an appropriate notion of integrality in the dual program is, thus inhibiting
the generalization of the theory to more general forms of structured convex
optimization. (In fact, we argue that the rank-one constraint usually added to
SDP relaxations is not adequate in the dual SDP.)
  In this paper, we propose a notion of total dual integrality for SDPs that
generalizes the notion for LPs, by relying on an ""integrality constraint"" for
SDPs that is primal-dual symmetric. A key ingredient for the theory is a
generalization to compact convex sets of a result of Hoffman for polytopes,
fundamental for generalizing the polyhedral notion of total dual integrality
introduced by Edmonds and Giles. We study the corresponding theory applied to
SDP formulations for stable sets in graphs using the Lov\'asz theta function
and show that total dual integrality in this case corresponds to the underlying
graph being perfect. We also relate dual integrality of an SDP formulation for
the maximum cut problem to bipartite graphs. Total dual integrality for
extended formulations naturally comes into play in this context.

as a composite hypothesis test, where SSVEPs are assumed to admit a sparse
representation in a Ramanujan Periodicity Transform (RPT) dictionary. For the
binary case, we develop and analyze the performance of an RPT detector based on
a derived generalized likelihood ratio test. Our approach is extended to
multi-hypothesis multi-electrode settings, where we capture the spatial
correlation between the electrodes using pre-stimulus data. We also introduce a
new metric for evaluating SSVEP detection schemes based on their achievable
efficiency and discrimination rate tradeoff for given system resources. We
obtain exact distributions of the test statistic in terms of confluent

outperforms spectral-based methods. Its performance also surpasses the
state-of-the-art Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) methods with respect to
accuracy and sample complexity in short data lengths regimes crucial for
real-time applications. The proposed approach is asymptotically optimal as it
closes the gap to a perfect measurement bound as the data length increases. In
contrast to existing supervised methods which are highly data-dependent, the
RPT detector only uses pre-stimulus data to estimate the per-subject spatial
correlation, thereby dispensing with considerable overhead associated with data
collection for a large number of subjects and stimuli. Our work advances the

horizontal wave in plate-like structures is very useful for long distance
defects inspection since its fundamental mode (SH0) is totally non-dispersive.
However, all the currently available SH wave transducers are not suitable for
practical SHM. In this work, we firstly investigated via finite element
simulations the performances of thickness-poled d15 PZT ring based
omni-directional SH wave piezoelectric transducers (OSH-PT) consisting of
different number of elements. Results show that the two half-rings based OSH-PT
can have perfect omni-directivity and acceptable performances in
excitation/reception of SH0 waves, and its performances can be fairly enhanced
by reducing the outer and inner diameters. Experimental results on a 2mm-thick,
21mm outer-diameter, 9mm inner-diameter two-half-ring OSH-PT shows that it has
good omni-directional properties with the maximum deviation of ~14% in both
excitation and reception of SH0 wave. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the
OSH-PT in the case of self-excitation and self-reception is over 15dB from
145kHz to 200kHz, which is acceptable for most applications. The proposed
two-half-ring OSH-PT is expected to be widely used in SH0 wave based SHM due to
its simple structure, easy fabrication/assembling, low cost and acceptable
performances.

down the irreducible components of the standard parametrizing varieties for the
$\Lambda$-modules with a fixed dimension vector, and (b) assembling generic
information on the modules in each individual component, that is, assembling
data shared by all modules in a dense open subset of that component.
  We present an overview of results spanning the spectrum from hereditary
algebras through the tame non-hereditary case to wild non-hereditary algebras.

Using this, we prove their saturation and investigate when they are nonzero. We
also show that for certain partitions the associated stretched polynomials

then provide a polytopal description of this multiplicity and show that its
positivity may be computed in strongly polynomial time. Finally, we remark that

smart cities, which allow for higher energy efficiency and lower environmental

ability to recharge a vehicle at a speed comparable to traditional gas
refueling, i.e., less than $3$ minutes per vehicle. Such a technology, referred
to as Ultra-Fast Charging (UFC), has drawn much interest from research and
industry. The large power density, impulsive, and stochastic loading
characteristics of UFC, however, pose unprecedented challenges to existing
electricity supply infrastructure. Planning the locations and electric
capacities of these UFC stations is critical to preventing detrimental impacts,
including grid asset depreciation, grid instabilities, and deteriorated power

inside the ball's frame of reference is considered. The equations of motion are
derived by applying Euler-Poincar\'e's symmetry reduction method in concert
with Lagrange-d'Alembert's principle, which accounts for the presence of the
nonholonomic rolling constraint. As a particular example, we consider the case
when the masses move along internal rails, or trajectories, of arbitrary shape
and fixed within the ball's frame of reference. Our system of equations can
treat most possible methods of actuating the rolling ball with internal moving
masses encountered in the literature, such as circular motion of the masses
mimicking swinging pendula or straight line motion of the masses mimicking
magnets sliding inside linear tubes embedded within a solenoid. Moreover, our
method can model arbitrary rail shapes and an arbitrary number of rails such as
several ellipses and/or figure eights, which may be important for future
designs of rolling ball robots. For further analytical study, we also reduce
the system to a single differential equation when the motion is planar, that
is, considering the motion of the rolling disk actuated by internal point
masses, in which case we show that the results obtained from the variational
derivation coincide with those obtained from Newton's second law. Finally, the
equations of motion are solved numerically, illustrating a wealth of complex
behaviors exhibited by the system's dynamics. Our results are relevant to the
dynamics of nonholonomic systems containing internal degrees of freedom and to
further studies of control of such systems actuated by internal masses.

variability of activity instances, the temporal feature pyramid is used to

temporal feature pyramid, an activity proposal detector and an activity

Temporal contextual information is fused into activity classifiers for better
recognition. More importantly, the entire model at all levels can be trained
end-to-end. Our CMS-RC3D detector can deal with activities at all temporal
scale ranges with only a single pass through the backbone network. We test our

Extensive experiments show that the proposed CMS-RC3D detector outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on THUMOS14 by a substantial margin and achieves

  Presence of Pointers",,,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Flow- and context-sensitive points-to analysis is difficult to scale; for
top-down approaches, the problem centers on repeated analysis of the same
procedure; for bottom-up approaches, the abstractions used to represent
procedure summaries have not scaled while preserving precision.
  We propose a novel abstraction called the Generalized Points-to Graph (GPG)
which views points-to relations as memory updates and generalizes them using
the counts of indirection levels leaving the unknown pointees implicit. This
allows us to construct GPGs as compact representations of bottom-up procedure
summaries in terms of memory updates and control flow between them. Their
compactness is ensured by the following optimizations: strength reduction
reduces the indirection levels, redundancy elimination removes redundant memory
updates and minimizes control flow (without over-approximating data dependence
between memory updates), and call inlining enhances the opportunities of these
optimizations. We devise novel operations and data flow analyses for these
optimizations.
  Our quest for scalability of points-to analysis leads to the following
insight: The real killer of scalability in program analysis is not the amount
of data but the amount of control flow that it may be subjected to in search of
precision. The effectiveness of GPGs lies in the fact that they discard as much
control flow as possible without losing precision (i.e., by preserving data
dependence without over-approximation). This is the reason why the GPGs are
very small even for main procedures that contain the effect of the entire
program. This allows our implementation to scale to 158kLoC for C programs.

driven with dc field and quantum light simultaneously in strong coupling
regime. The interaction of atoms with light leads to entanglement of electron
and photon states (dressing of the atoms). The driving via dc field leads to
the Bloch oscillations (BO) in the chain of dressed atoms. We considered the
mutual influence of dressing and BO and show that scenario of oscillations
dramatically differs from predicted by the Jaynes-Cummings and Bloch-Zener
models. We study the evolution of the population inversion, tunneling current,
photon probability distribution, mean number of photons, photon number variance
and show the influence of BO on the quantum-statistical characteristics of
light. For example, collapse-revivals picture and vacuum Rabi-oscillations are
strongly modulated with Bloch frequency. As a result, quantum properties of
light and degree of electron-photon entanglement become controllable via
adiabatic dc field turning. On the other hand, the low-frequency tunneling
current depends on the quantum light statistics (in particular, for coherent
initial state it is modulated accordingly the collapse-revivals picture). The
developed model is universal with respect to the physical origin of artificial
atom and frequency range of atom-light interaction. The model is adapted to the
2D-heterostructures (THz frequencies), semiconductor quantum dots (optical
range), and Josephson junctions (microwaves). The data for numerical
simulations are taken from recently published experiments. The obtained results
open a new ways in quantum state engineering and nano-photonic spectroscopy.

the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, we develop a method to ascertain

recovering the full topology of the network. A key ingredient of our method is
the maximum likelihood estimation of the probabilities associated with actual

two kinds of probability values without any ambiguity, insofar as the length of
the available binary time series is reasonably long. Our method does not
require any {\em a priori} knowledge of the detailed dynamical processes, is
parameter free, and is capable of accurate reconstruction even in the presence
of noise. We demonstrate the method using combinations of distinct types of
binary dynamical processes and network topologies, and provide a physical
understanding of the underlying reconstruction mechanism. Our statistical
inference based reconstruction method contributes an additional piece to the

and the dip structure in the spectrum is directly related to the absorption of
one XUV photon of the ionized electron during the laser-assisted collision
(LAC) with its parent ion in the two-color laser fields. Moreover, by employing
the saddle-point approximation, we obtain the classical energy orbit equation,
and find that the dip structure comes from the fact that the LAC is limited at
a certain direction by the momentum conservation law as the electron absorbs
one XUV photon during the collision, where the probability of the HATI gets its
minimum value. Finally, we find that the interference pattern in the whole

moments $t_0$ and $2\pi/\omega_1-t_0$ in the LAC process.

governing fast waves in coronal slabs for which the continuous transverse
distributions of the physical parameters comprise a uniform core, a uniform
external medium, and a transition layer (TL) in between. The profiles in the TL
are allowed to be essentially arbitrary. Restricting ourselves to the first
several branches of fast modes, which are of most interest from the
observational standpoint, we find that a finite plasma beta plays an at most
marginal role in influencing the periods ($P$), damping times ($\tau$), and
critical longitudinal wavenumbers ($k_{\rm c}$), when both $P$ and $\tau$ are
measured in units of the transverse fast time. However, these parameters are in
general significantly affected by how the TL profiles are described. We
conclude that, for typical coronal structures, the dispersive properties of the
first several branches of fast standing modes can be evaluated with the much
simpler theory for cold slabs provided that the transverse profiles are
properly addressed and the transverse Alfv\'en time in cold MHD is replaced

services or offline data analytics, how to evaluate the upper bound performance
and provide apple-to-apple comparisons are fundamental problems. To this end, a
unified computation-centric metric is an essential requirement. As the most
important computation-centric performance metric, FLOPS has guided computing
systems evolutions for many years. However, our observations demonstrate that
the average FLOPS efficiency of the DC workloads is only 0.1%, which implies
that FLOPS is inappropriate for DC computing. To address the above issue, we
propose BOPS (Basic Operations Per Second), which is the average number of BOPs
(Basic OPerations) completed per second. We conduct the analysis on the
characteristics of seventeen typical DC workloads and extract the minimum
representative computation operations set, which is composed of integer and
floating point computation operations of arithmetic, comparing and array
addressing. Then, we propose the formalized BOPS definition and the BOPS based
upper bound performance model. Finally, the BOPS measuring tool is also
implemented. We perform experiments with seventeen DC workloads on three
typical Intel processors platforms. First, BOPS can reflect the performance gap
of different computing systems, the bias between the peak BOPS performance gap
and the average DC workloads' wall clock time gap is no more than 10%. Second,
the Sort workload can achieve 32% BOPS efficiency on the experimental platform.
At last, we present two use cases of BOPS. One is the BOPS based system
evaluation, we illustrate that BOPS can compare performance of workloads from
multiple domains. The other is BOPS based optimizations. We show that under the
guiding of the BOPS based upper bound model, the Sort workload and the Redis
workload achieve 4.4X and 1.2X performance improvements respectively.

this analysis signatures of transversal coronal loop oscillations that are
damped rapidly were found with dominant oscillation periods in the range of
$\rm{P=12.25-15.80}$ minutes. Also, damping times and damping qualities of
transversal coronal loop oscillations at dominant oscillation periods are
estimated in the range of $ \rm{\tau_d=11.76-21.46}$ minutes and $

the theoretical prediction for damping of kink mode oscillations by dissipation

a velocity up to 12 km s^-1. Electron densities of the isolated condensation

10^8 cm^-3 at r=1.7 R, superposed on a background corona of 10^7 cm^-3 density.

distribution of angular momentum in stellar interiors, and its evolution with
time remains an open issue in stellar physics. Owing to the unprecedented
quality of Kepler photometry, we are able to seismically infer internal
rotation rates in \gamma Doradus stars, which provide the MS counterpart to the
red-giants puzzle. We confront these internal rotation rates to stellar
evolution models with rotationally induced transport of angular momentum, in
order to test angular momentum transport mechanisms. We used a stellar
model-independent method developed by Christophe et al. in order to obtain
seismically inferred, buoyancy radii and near-core rotation for 37 \gamma
Doradus stars observed by Kepler. We show that the buoyancy radius can be used
as a reliable evolution indicator for field stars on the MS. We computed
rotating evolutionary models including transport of angular momentum in
radiative zones, following Zahn and Maeder, with the CESTAM code. This code
calculates the rotational history of stars from the birth line to the tip of
the RGB. The initial angular momentum content has to be set initially, which is
done by fitting rotation periods in young stellar clusters. We show a clear
disagreement between the near-core rotation rates measured in the sample and
the rotation rates obtained from evolutionary models including rotationally
induced transport following Zahn (1992). These results show a disagreement
similar to that of the Sun and red giant stars. This suggests the existence of
missing mechanisms responsible for the braking of the core before and along the
MS. The efficiency of the missing mechanisms is investigated. The transport of
angular momentum as formalized by Zahn and Maeder cannot explain the
measurements of near-core rotation in main-sequence intermediate-mass stars we
have at hand.

based proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers to handle second order

for pole placement in delay-free systems. The presence of the time delay term
manifests itself as a higher order system with variable number of interlaced
poles and zeros upon Pade approximation, which makes it difficult to achieve
precise pole placement control. We here report the analytical expressions to
constrain the closed loop dominant and non-dominant poles at the desired
locations in the complex s-plane, using a third order Pade approximation for
the delay term. However, invariance of the closed loop performance with
different time delay approximation has also been verified using increasing
order of Pade, representing a closed to reality higher order delay dynamics.
The choice of the nature of non-dominant poles e.g. all being complex, real or
a combination of them modifies the characteristic equation and influences the
achievable stability regions. The effect of different types of non-dominant
poles and the corresponding stability regions are obtained for nine test-bench
processes indicating different levels of open-loop damping and lag to delay
ratio. Next, we investigate which expression yields a wider stability region in
the design parameter space by using Monte Carlo simulations while uniformly
sampling a chosen design parameter space. Various time and frequency domain
control performance parameters are investigated next, as well as their
deviations with uncertain process parameters, using thousands of Monte Carlo
simulations, around the robust stable solution for each of the nine test-bench

counterpart. However, 3D facial landmark localization in a single image is
challenging due to the ambiguous nature of landmarks under 3D perspective.
Existing approaches typically adopt a suboptimal two-step strategy, performing
2D landmark localization followed by depth estimation. In this paper, we
propose the Joint Voxel and Coordinate Regression (JVCR) method for 3D facial
landmark localization, addressing it more effectively in an end-to-end fashion.
First, a compact volumetric representation is proposed to encode the per-voxel
likelihood of positions being the 3D landmarks. The dimensionality of such a
representation is fixed regardless of the number of target landmarks, so that
the curse of dimensionality could be avoided. Then, a stacked hourglass network
is adopted to estimate the volumetric representation from coarse to fine,
followed by a 3D convolution network that takes the estimated volume as input
and regresses 3D coordinates of the face shape. In this way, the 3D structural
constraints between landmarks could be learned by the neural network in a more
efficient manner. Moreover, the proposed pipeline enables end-to-end training
and improves the robustness and accuracy of 3D facial landmark localization.
The effectiveness of our approach is validated on the 3DFAW and AFLW2000-3D
datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in comparison with existing methods.

impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at 25$^{\circ}$C. Here, this analysis is extended
to the full temperature range of batteries from -40$^{\circ}$C to
+80$^{\circ}$C for Li, Na, K and Rb-metal electrodes in carbonate electrolytes.
Two different transport mechanisms are found. The first one conducts
alkali-ions at all measured temperatures. The second transport mechanism
conducts ions for all seven measured Li-ion electrolytes and one out of four
Na-ion electrolytes, however, only above a certain critical temperature $T_C$.
At $T_C$ a phase transition is observed switching-off the more efficient

associated overpotentials increase rapidly below $T_C$ depending on alkali-ion,
salt and solvent and become a limiting factor during galvanostatic operation of

inequalities on that kind of shells for $\Bu\in W^{1,2}$ vector fields,
imposing no boundary or normalization conditions on $\Bu.$ The constants in the
estimates are optimal in terms of the asymptotics in the shell thickness $h,$
having the scalings $h$ or $O(1).$ The Korn interpolation inequality reduces
the problem of deriving any linear Korn type estimate for shells to simply
proving a Poincar\'e type estimate with the symmetrized gradient on the right
hand side. In particular this applies to linear geometric rigidity estimates
for shells, i.e., Korn's fist inequality without boundary conditions.

  text overlap with arXiv:1801.08258. We have combined both works into a single
  paper (see arXiv: 1801.08258v2)",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electrons accelerated in relativistic collisionless shocks are usually
assumed to follow a power-law energy distribution with an index of $p$.
Observationally, although most gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have afterglows that are
consistent with $p>2$, there are still a few GRBs suggestive of a hard ($p<2$)
electron energy spectrum. Our previous works found strong evidence for the
exist of a double power-law hard electron energy (DPLH) spectrum with
$1<p_1<2$, $p_2>2$ and an injection break assumed as $\gamma_{\rm b}\propto
\gamma^{q}$ in the relativistic regime. Moreover, these works suggested a
possibly universal value of $q\sim0.5$. GRB~060908 is another case that shows a
flat spectrum in the optical/near-infrared band and requires a hard electron
energy distribution, which, along with the rich multi-band afterglow data,
provides us an opportunity to test this conjecture. Based on the model of
\citet{Resmi08}, we explain the multi-band afterglow of GRB~060908 in a wind
medium and take also the synchrotron self-Compton effect. We show that though
the DPLH spectrum is favored by the afterglow data, the value of $q$ is badly
constrained due to the relatively large uncertainties of the spectral indices.
However, the afterglow can be well reproduced if we adopt $q=0.5$, implying the
compatibility of the above conjecture with the data.

Being relatively
intricate devices, and often exhibiting intense parameter variation, this type
of electronic devices has motivated much research interest especially regarding
their characterization and modeling. In this work, we apply a recently reported
modeling methodology, based on the Early effect, for characterizing new old
stock NPN and PNP small signal germanium junction transistors and comparing
them to more modern silicon bipolar junction devices. The Early approach is
special in the sense that its two parameters, namely the Early voltage $V_a$
and a proportionality parameter $s$, are fixed and independent of transistor
operation. Remarkable results are obtained, including the fact that the four
considered groups, namely NPN and PNP germanium and silicon devices, occupy
mostly non-overlapping regions in the Early parameter space, with PNP devices
presenting larger parameter variability in both cases. Surprisingly, the
considered germanium devices exhibited smaller parameter variability than
observed for the silicon counterparts. When mapped into the more traditional
space defined by the current gain and output resistance parameters, the four
transistor groups exhibited much larger overlaps and yielded a clustering
structure much less organized than allowed by the Early mapping. This result
suggest that the Early representation of transistors is more compatible and
inherently related to the structure of amplifying devices such as those
considered in this work. In addition, it was verified that the center of mass
of each of the NPN-PNP pairs of germanium and silicon devices are crossed by
respective $\beta$-isolines for gains of 130 and 250, respectively. Germanium
devices were also characterized as having smaller output resistance and smaller
magnitudes of Early voltage.

disease and are the model system of choice for much of basic neuroscience. High
frame rates (250 Hz) are needed to quantify the kinematics of these running
rodents. Manual tracking, especially for multiple markers, becomes
time-consuming and impossible. Therefore, an automated method is necessary. We
propose a method to track the paws of the animal in the following manner:
first, segmenting all the possible paws based on color; second, classifying the
segmented objects using a support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN);
third, classifying the objects using the kinematic features of the running
animal, coupled with texture features from earlier frames; and finally,
detecting and handling collisions to assure the correctness of labelled paws.
The proposed method is validated in sixty 1,000 frame video sequences (4
seconds) captured by four cameras from five mice. The total sensitivity for
tracking of the front and hind paw is 99.70% using the SVM classifier and
99.76% using the NN classifier. In addition, we show the feasibility of 3D
reconstruction using the four camera system.

attractors along with their one set of parameter values, phase space dynamics
and the Largest Lyapunov Exponents (LLE). The expressions of these new
Lorenz-like nonlinear dynamical systems have been automatically evolved through
multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP). In the past two decades, there have been
many claims of designing new chaotic attractors as an incremental extension of
the Lorenz family. We provide here a large family of chaotic systems whose
structure closely resemble the original Lorenz system but with drastically
different phase space dynamics. This advances the state of the art knowledge of
discovering new chaotic systems which can find application in many real-world
problems. This work may also find its archival value in future in the domain of
