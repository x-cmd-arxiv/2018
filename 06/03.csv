foliation, where we consider a singular foliation as a locally generated
$\mathscr{O}$-submodule of vector fields on the underlying manifold closed
under Lie bracket. Here $\mathscr{O}$ can be the ring of smooth, holomorphic,
or real analytic functions. The choices entering the construction of this Lie
$\infty$-algebroid, including the chosen underlying resolution, are unique up
to homotopy and, moreover, every other Lie $\infty$-algebroid inducing the same
foliation or any of its sub-foliations factorizes through it in an
up-to-homotopy unique manner. We thus call it the universal Lie
$\infty$-algebroid of the singular foliation. For real analytic or holomorphic
singular foliations, it can be chosen, locally, to be a Lie $n$-algebroid for
some finite $n$. We show that this universal structure encodes several aspects
of the geometry of the leaves of a singular foliation. In particular, it
contains the holonomy algebroid and groupoid of a leaf in the sense of
Androulidakis and Skandalis. But even more, each leaf carries an isotropy
$L_\infty$-algebra structure that is unique up to isomorphism. It extends a
minimal isotropy Lie algebra, that can be associated to each leaf, by higher
brackets, which give rise to additional invariants of the foliation. As a
byproduct, we construct an example of a foliation generated by $r$ vector
fields for which we show by these techniques that it cannot be generated by the
image through the anchor map of a Lie algebroid of the minimal rank $r$.

take a ubiquitous design of a bolted elastic plate and show that such a design

We harness the complex interaction of the bolts and the plate to show the
existence of a pair of double Dirac cones near the resonant frequency of the
bolt. The manipulation of bolted patterns results in the opening of multiple
topological bandgaps, including a complete bandgap that forbids all plate
modes. We demonstrate that inside this bandgap, the interface between two
topologically distinct zones can guide flexural waves crisply around sharp
bends.

across many auctions but this type of fraud is difficult to detect due to its
similarity to normal bidding behaviour. The unavailability of SB datasets makes
the development of SB detection and classification models burdensome.
Furthermore, to implement efficient SB detection models, we should produce SB
data from actual auctions of commercial sites. In this study, we first scraped
a large number of eBay auctions of a popular product. After preprocessing the
raw auction data, we build a high-quality SB dataset based on the most reliable
SB strategies. The aim of our research is to share the preprocessed auction

can apply various machine learning techniques by using authentic data of

these issues by developing a probabilistic framework based on the theory of
random labeled point processes and characterizing a Bayes clusterer that
minimizes the number of misclustered points. The Bayes clusterer is analogous
to the Bayes classifier. Whereas determining a Bayes classifier requires full
knowledge of the feature-label distribution, deriving a Bayes clusterer
requires full knowledge of the point process. When uncertain of the point
process, one would like to find a robust clusterer that is optimal over the
uncertainty, just as one may find optimal robust classifiers with uncertain
feature-label distributions. Herein, we derive an optimal robust clusterer by
first finding an effective random point process that incorporates all
randomness within its own probabilistic structure and from which a Bayes
clusterer can be derived that provides an optimal robust clusterer relative to
the uncertainty. This is analogous to the use of effective class-conditional
distributions in robust classification. After evaluating the performance of
robust clusterers in synthetic mixtures of Gaussians models, we apply the
framework to granular imaging, where we make use of the asymptotic
granulometric moment theory for granular images to relate robust clustering
theory to the application.

and argue that although many techniques, methodologies, and models have been
created to detect emotion in text, there are various reasons that make these
methods insufficient. Although, there is an essential need to improve the
design and architecture of current systems, factors such as the complexity of
human emotions, and the use of implicit and metaphorical language in expressing
it, lead us to think that just re-purposing standard methodologies will not be
enough to capture these complexities, and it is important to pay attention to
the linguistic intricacies of emotion expression.

nanoclusters formed by deposition onto oxide surfaces decreases as the cluster
size increases. An explanation for this behavior is provided here, which is
based on the notion that the atoms in the clusters are not uniformly charged,
but that the edge atoms are positively charged while the center atoms are
nearly neutral. This leads to upward pointing dipoles at the edge atoms that
increase the neutralization probability of alkali ions scattered from those
atoms. As the clusters increase in size, the number of edge atoms relative to
the number of center atoms decreases, so that that the average neutralization
also decreases. Calculations employing this model are compared to experimental
data and indicate good agreement if the strengths of the dipoles at the edge

differences in the neutralization probabilities of scattered Na$^+$ and Li$^+$.

range of application. The complexity stems from properties of the underlying
graphs, in which slight local changes can lead to sizable variations of global
prop- erties, e.g., under certain conditions, a single link cut that may be
overlooked during monitoring can result in splitting the graph into two
disconnected components. Moreover, it is often difficult to determine whether a
change will propagate globally or remain local. Traditional graph theory
measure such as the centrality or the assortativity of the graph are not
satisfying to characterize global properties of the graph. In this paper, we
tackle the problem of real-time monitoring of dynamic large scale graphs by
developing a geometric approach that leverages notions of geometric curvature
and recent development in graph embeddings using Ollivier-Ricci curvature [47].
We illustrate the use of our method by consid- ering the practical case of
monitoring dynamic variations of global Internet using topology changes
information provided by combining several BGP feeds. In particular, we use our
method to detect major events and changes via the geometry of the embedding of
the graph.

coupled to an external chaotic system whose intrinsic dynamics is dissimilar to
the other oscillators in the network. Specifically, each oscillator couples to
the mean-field of the oscillators below it in the hierarchy, and couples
diffusively to the oscillator above it in the hierarchy. We find that coupling
to one dissimilar external system manages to suppress the chaotic dynamics of
all the oscillators in the network at sufficiently high coupling strength. This
holds true irrespective of whether the connection to the external system is
direct or indirect through oscillators at another level in the hierarchy.
Investigating the synchronization properties show that the oscillators have the
same steady state at a particular level of hierarchy, whereas the steady state
varies across different hierarchical levels. We quantify the efficacy of
control by estimating the fraction of random initial states that go to fixed
points, a measure analogous to basin stability. These quantitative results
indicate the easy controllability of hierarchical networks of chaotic
oscillators by an external chaotic system, thereby suggesting a potent method
that may help design control strategies.

In this paper, we show that such specialization is not necessary. eRPC is a new

comparable to specialized systems, while running on commodity CPUs in
traditional datacenter networks based on either lossy Ethernet or lossless

nodes and CPU cores. It handles packet loss, congestion, and background request
execution. In microbenchmarks, one CPU core can handle up to 10 million small
RPCs per second, or send large messages at 75 Gbps. We port a production-grade
implementation of Raft state machine replication to eRPC without modifying the

narrow channel regions of an increased width, which we call ""stubs"" for
optimizing the boundary conditions and for controlling the plasma velocity. We
developed a compact model for THz plasmonic devices using the transmission line

TL with a stub. We applied this model to demonstrate that the stubs could
effectively control the boundary conditions and/or the conditions at
interfaces. We derived and solved the dispersion equation for the device with
the stubs and showed that periodic or aperiodic systems of stubs allow for
slowing down the plasma waves in a controllable manner in a wide range. Our
results show that the stub designs provide a way to achieve the optimum
boundary conditions and could also be used for multi finger structures - stub
plasmonic crystals - yielding better performance of THz electronic detectors,

is still challenging to predict future series given historical observations and

among different components of exogenous variables which may affect the
prediction accuracy, or cannot model the correlations between exogenous data
and target data. Besides, the inherent temporal dynamics of exogenous data are
also related to the target series prediction, and thus should be considered as
well. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model,
i.e., Hierarchical attention-based Recurrent Highway Network (HRHN), which
incorporates spatio-temporal feature extraction of exogenous variables and
temporal dynamics modeling of target variables into a single framework.
Moreover, by introducing the hierarchical attention mechanism, HRHN can
adaptively select the relevant exogenous features in different semantic levels.
We carry out comprehensive empirical evaluations with various methods over
several datasets, and show that HRHN outperforms the state of the arts in time
series prediction, especially in capturing sudden changes and sudden

finding is varying the pairing strength within a quite large range has only
minor effects on the dynamics. We find notable differences in the excitation
energy sharing between the fission fragments in the cases of spontaneous and
induced fission. With increasing initial excitation energy of the fissioning
nucleus more excitation energy is deposited in the heavy fragment, in agreement
with experimental data on average neutron multiplicities.

natural-language requirements, many approaches based on Natural Language
Processing (NLP) have been proposed in the literature. Given the large amount
of approaches in this area, and since many practitioners are eager to utilize
such techniques, it is important to synthesize and provide an overview of the
state-of-the-art in this area. Objective: Our objective is to summarize the
state-of-the-art in NLP-assisted software testing which could benefit
practitioners to potentially utilize those NLP-based techniques. Moreover, this
can benefit researchers in providing an overview of the research landscape.
Method: To address the above need, we conducted a survey in the form of a
systematic literature mapping (classification). After compiling an initial pool
of 95 papers, we conducted a systematic voting, and our final pool included 67
technical papers. Results: This review paper provides an overview of the
contribution types presented in the papers, types of NLP approaches used to
assist software testing, types of required input requirements, and a review of
tool support in this area. Some key results we have detected are: (1) only four
of the 38 tools (11%) presented in the papers are available for download; (2) a
larger ratio of the papers (30 of 67) provided a shallow exposure to the NLP
aspects (almost no details). Conclusion: This paper would benefit both
practitioners and researchers by serving as an ""index"" to the body of knowledge
in this area. The results could help practitioners utilizing the existing
NLP-based techniques; this in turn reduces the cost of test-case design and
decreases the amount of human resources spent on test activities. After sharing
this review with some of our industrial collaborators, initial insights show
that this review can indeed be useful and beneficial to practitioners.

The central quantities in this research are token frequencies of linguistic

wide variety of reasons, including purely random sampling effects, or because
corpora are composed of contemporary media and fiction texts within which the
underlying topics ebb and flow with cultural and socio-political trends. In
this work, we introduce a simple model for controlling for topical fluctuations
in corpora - the topical-cultural advection model - and demonstrate how it
provides a robust baseline of variability in word frequency changes over time.
We validate the model on a diachronic corpus spanning two centuries, and a
carefully-controlled artificial language change scenario, and then use it to
correct for topical fluctuations in historical time series. Finally, we use the
model to show that the emergence of new words typically corresponds with the
rise of a trending topic. This suggests that some lexical innovations occur due
to growing communicative need in a subspace of the lexicon, and that the
topical-cultural advection model can be used to quantify this.

  August 2018","10.1016/j.nima.2018.08.035",,"astro-ph.IM hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many of the characteristics of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs), such as high
Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE), are well matched to the requirements of the
cameras of the Small-Sized Telescopes (SSTs) proposed for the Cherenkov
Telescope Array. In fact, compared to a single mirror, the double mirror
Schwarzschild Couder configuration provides a much better Point Spread Function
over a large field of view. It allows better correction of aberrations at large
off axis angles and facilitates the construction of compact telescopes.
Moreover, the small plate scale of the dual-mirror SSTs allows the use of SiPM
detectors despite their small pixel sizes. These sensors have two further
advantages compared to the Photo Multipliers Tubes: the low cost and the
possibility to observe in very high Night Sky Background (NSB) light level
without any damage. However, one area in which SiPM performance has required
improvement is Optical CrossTalk (OCT), where multiple avalanches are induced
by a single impinging photon. OCT, coupled with the typical NSB rate of 25
MCnts/s per pixel during Cherenkov observations, can place severe constraints
on the triggering capability of the cameras. This paper describes the
performance of novel Low Voltage Reverse (LVR) 2nd and 3rd generation Multi
Pixel Photon Counters manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics. These are designed
to have both enhanced PDE and reduced OCT. Two 7 x 7 mm2 S14520 LVR2 MPPCs with
75 um microcells are tested and compared with detectors of the same pixel size
with 50 um microcells. A comparative analysis of a 3 x 3 mm2 S14520 LVR2 device
and an S14520 LVR3 device is also carried out, demonstrating that the LVR3
gives better photon detection in the 240 380 nm wavelength range. Finally, the
effect of an infrared filter on the OCT is analysed.

or bad data is detected by the high value of normalized measurement residuals
that exceeds the threshold value, determined by the $\chi^2$ distribution.
However, high normalized residuals can also be caused by another type of
anomaly, namely gross modeling or topology error. In this paper we propose a
method to distinguish between these two sources of anomalies - 1) malicious
sensor data and 2) modeling error. The anomaly detector will start with
assuming a case of malicious data and suspect some of the individual
measurements corresponding to the highest normalized residuals to be
`malicious', unless proved otherwise. Then, choosing a change of basis, the
state space is transformed and decomposed into `observable' and `unobservable'
parts with respect to these `suspicious' measurements. We argue that, while the
anomaly due to malicious data can only affect the `observable' part of the
states, there exists no such restriction for anomalies due to modeling error.
Numerical results illustrate how the proposed anomaly diagnosis based on Kalman
decomposition can successfully distinguish between the two types of anomalies.

The low-level semantic outputs quantify the diagnostic features used by
radiologists and serve to explain how the model interprets the images in an
expert-driven manner. The information from these low-level tasks, along with
the representations learned by the convolutional layers, are then combined and
used to infer the high-level task of predicting nodule malignancy. This unified

quantumness can be maintained and detected over a long distance. Previously,
the non-classical character of neutrino oscillation was tested with the
Leggett-Garg inequality, where a clear violation of the classical bound was
observed [J. A. Formaggio et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 050402 (2016)].
However, there are several limitations in testing neutrino oscillations with
the Leggett-Garg inequality. In particular, the degree of violation of the
Leggett-Garg inequality cannot be taken as a ""measure of quantumness"". Here we
focus on quantifying the quantumness of experimentally-observed neutrino
oscillation, using the tools of recently-developed quantum resource theory. We
analyzed ensembles of reactor and accelerator neutrinos at distinct energies
from a variety of neutrino sources, including Daya Bay (0.5 km and 1.6 km),
Kamland (180 km), MINOS (735 km), and T2K (295 km). The quantumness of the
three-flavoured neutrino oscillation is characterized within a 3{\sigma} range
relative to the theoretical prediction. It is found that the maximal coherence
was observed in the neutrino source from the Kamland reactor. However, even
though the survival probability of the Daya Bay experiment did not vary
significantly (dropped about 10 percent), the coherence recorded can reach up
to 40 percent of the maximal value. These results represent the longest
distance over which quantumness were experimentally determined for quantum
particles other than photons.

spite of internal movements of individuals. This is possible because individual
group members repeatedly adjust their position and motion in response to the
position and motion of other group members. Here we develop a theoretical
approach to address the question, what general features -- if any -- underlie
the interaction rules that mediate group stability in animals of all species?
We do so by considering how the spatial organisation of a group would change in
the complete absence of interactions. Without interactions, a group would
disperse in a way that can be easily characterised in terms of Fick's diffusion
equations. We can hence address the inverse theoretical problem of finding the
individual-level interaction responses that are required to counterbalance
diffusion and to preserve group stability. We show that an individual-level
response to neighbour densities in the form of Weber's law (a 'universal' law
describing the functioning of the sensory systems of animals of all species)
results in an 'anti-diffusion' term at the group level. On short time scales,
this anti-diffusion restores the initial group configuration in a way which is
reminiscent of methods for image deblurring in image processing. We also show
that any non-homogeneous, spatial density distribution can be preserved over
time if individual movement patterns have the form of a Weber's law response.
Weber's law describes the fundamental functioning of perceptual systems. Our
study indicates that it is also a necessary -- but not sufficient -- feature of
collective interactions in stable animal groups.

Accordingly, in this work, we employ first-principles calculations to
investigate the nature of local chemical order and establish its relationship
to the intrinsic and extrinsic stacking fault energy (SFE) in CrCoNi
medium-entropy solid-solution alloys, whose combination of strength, ductility
and toughness properties approach the best on record. We find that the average
intrinsic and extrinsic SFE are both highly tunable, with values ranging from
-43 mJ.m-2 to 30 mJ.m-2 and from -28 mJ.m-2 to 66 mJ.m-2, respectively, as the
degree of local chemical order increases. The state of local ordering also
strongly correlates with the energy difference between the face-centered cubic

transformation-induced plasticity. This theoretical study demonstrates that
chemical short-range order is thermodynamically favored in HEAs and can be
tuned to affect the mechanical behavior of these alloys. It thus addresses the

services in recent years. With tremendous images uploaded everyday,
understanding users' preferences on user-generated images and making
recommendations have become an urgent need. In fact, many hybrid models have
been proposed to fuse various kinds of side information~(e.g., image visual
representation, social network) and user-item historical behavior for enhancing
recommendation performance. However, due to the unique characteristics of the
user generated images in social image platforms, the previous studies failed to
capture the complex aspects that influence users' preferences in a unified
framework. Moreover, most of these hybrid models relied on predefined weights
in combining different kinds of information, which usually resulted in
sub-optimal recommendation performance. To this end, in this paper, we develop
a hierarchical attention model for social contextual image recommendation. In
addition to basic latent user interest modeling in the popular matrix
factorization based recommendation, we identify three key aspects (i.e., upload
history, social influence, and owner admiration) that affect each user's latent
preferences, where each aspect summarizes a contextual factor from the complex
relationships between users and images. After that, we design a hierarchical
attention network that naturally mirrors the hierarchical relationship
(elements in each aspects level, and the aspect level) of users' latent
interests with the identified key aspects. Specifically, by taking embeddings
from state-of-the-art deep learning models that are tailored for each kind of
data, the hierarchical attention network could learn to attend differently to
more or less content. Finally, extensive experimental results on real-world

to improve training speed and generalization performance by framing NN training
as a constrained optimization problem wherein the sum of the norm of the
weights in each layer of the network is minimized, under the constraint of
exactly fitting training data. It draws inspiration from support vector
machines (SVMs), which are able to generalize well, despite often having an
infinite number of free parameters in their primal form, and from recent
theoretical generalization bounds on NNs which suggest that lower norm
solutions generalize better. To solve this constrained optimization problem,
our method employs Lagrange multipliers that act as integrators of error over
training and identify `support vector'-like examples. The method can be
implemented as a wrapper around gradient based methods and uses standard
back-propagation of gradients from the NN for both regression and
classification versions of the algorithm. We provide theoretical justifications

derived in our analysis, the corresponding global significance is only
$0.54\sigma$. We thus do not find any significant line-like signal and set up

political purposes has been appearing in large numbers and gotten widespread in
the online world. With deceptive words, people can get infected by the fake
news very easily and will share them without any fact-checking. For instance,
during the 2016 US president election, various kinds of fake news about the
candidates widely spread through both official news media and the online social
networks. These fake news is usually released to either smear the opponents or
support the candidate on their side. The erroneous information in the fake news
is usually written to motivate the voters' irrational emotion and enthusiasm.
Such kinds of fake news sometimes can bring about devastating effects, and an
important goal in improving the credibility of online social networks is to
identify the fake news timely. In this paper, we propose to study the fake news
detection problem. Automatic fake news identification is extremely hard, since
pure model based fact-checking for news is still an open problem, and few
existing models can be applied to solve the problem. With a thorough
investigation of a fake news data, lots of useful explicit features are
identified from both the text words and images used in the fake news. Besides
the explicit features, there also exist some hidden patterns in the words and
images used in fake news, which can be captured with a set of latent features
extracted via the multiple convolutional layers in our model. A model named as
TI-CNN (Text and Image information based Convolutinal Neural Network) is
proposed in this paper. By projecting the explicit and latent features into a
unified feature space, TI-CNN is trained with both the text and image
information simultaneously. Extensive experiments carried on the real-world
fake news datasets have demonstrate the effectiveness of TI-CNN.

Nevertheless, their data conflict management is still sequential in essential

processing natural graphs.
  In this paper, we have the insight that the atomic operations for the vertex

  Collections Accurately and Affordably",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Crowdsourcing offers an affordable and scalable means to collect relevance
judgments for IR test collections. However, crowd assessors may show higher
variance in judgment quality than trusted assessors. In this paper, we
investigate how to effectively utilize both groups of assessors in partnership.
We specifically investigate how agreement in judging is correlated with three
factors: relevance category, document rankings, and topical variance. Based on
this, we then propose two collaborative judging methods in which a portion of
the document-topic pairs are assessed by in-house judges while the rest are
assessed by crowd-workers. Experiments conducted on two TREC collections show
encouraging results when we distribute work intelligently between our two
groups of assessors.

can be modeled based on spatially embedded networks. The inter-links between
two distant spatial networks, such as those formed by transcontinental airline
flights, play a crucial role in optimizing communication and transportation
over such long distances. Still, little is known about how inter-links affect
the resilience of such systems. Here, we develop a framework to study the
resilience of interlinked spatially embedded networks based on percolation
theory. We find that the inter-links can be regarded as an external field near
the percolation phase transition, analogous to a magnetic field in a
ferromagnetic-paramagnetic spin system. By defining the analogous critical
exponents $\delta$ and $\gamma$, we find that their values for various
inter-links structures follow Widom's scaling relations. Furthermore, we study
the optimal robustness of our model and compare it with the analysis of
real-world networks. The framework presented here not only facilitates the
understanding of phase transitions with external fields in complex networks but
also provides insight into optimizing real-world infrastructure networks and a
magnetic field in a management.

Nevertheless, few existing solutions can provide efficient load balance on

paper, we present a novel grouping approach (named FISH), which can provide the
efficient time-evolving stream processing at scale. The key insight of this
work is that the keys of time-evolving stream data can have a skewed
distribution within any bounded distance of time interval. This enables to
accurately identify the recent hot keys for the real-time load balance within a
bounded scope. We therefore propose an epoch-based recent hot key
identification with specialized intra-epoch frequency counting (for maintaining
low memory overhead) and inter-epoch hotness decaying (for suppressing
superfluous computation). We also propose to heuristically infer the accurate

cost-efficient worker assignment. We have integrated our approach into Apache

for prediction. This paper investigates the novel use of attention as a form of
feature augmentation, i.e, casted attention. We propose Multi-Cast Attention
Networks (MCAN), a new attention mechanism and general model architecture for a
potpourri of ranking tasks in the conversational modeling and question
answering domains. Our approach performs a series of soft attention operations,
each time casting a scalar feature upon the inner word embeddings. The key idea
is to provide a real-valued hint (feature) to a subsequent encoder layer and is
targeted at improving the representation learning process. There are several
advantages to this design, e.g., it allows an arbitrary number of attention
mechanisms to be casted, allowing for multiple attention types (e.g.,
co-attention, intra-attention) and attention variants (e.g., alignment-pooling,
max-pooling, mean-pooling) to be executed simultaneously. This not only
eliminates the costly need to tune the nature of the co-attention layer, but
also provides greater extents of explainability to practitioners. Via extensive
experiments on four well-known benchmark datasets, we show that MCAN achieves
state-of-the-art performance. On the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus, MCAN outperforms
existing state-of-the-art models by $9\%$. MCAN also achieves the best
performing score to date on the well-studied TrecQA dataset.

gap between on-chip Cache and main memory. It is essential to improve DRAM
cache hit rate and lower cache hit latency simultaneously. Prior DRAM cache
designs fall into two categories according to the data mapping polices:
set-associative and direct-mapped, achieving either one. In this paper, we
propose a partial direct-mapped die-stacked DRAM cache to achieve the both
objectives simultaneously, called Gemini, which is motivated by the following
observations: applying unified mapping policy to different blocks cannot
achieve high cache hit rate and low hit latency in terms of mapping structure.
Gemini cache classifies data into leading blocks and following blocks, and
places them with static mapping and dynamic mapping respectively in a unified
set-associative structure. Gemini also designs a replacement policy to balance
the different blocks miss penalty and the recency, and provides strategies to
mitigate cache thrashing due to block type transitions. Experimental results
demonstrate that Gemini cache can narrow the hit latency gap with direct-mapped
cache significantly, from 1.75X to 1.22X on average, and can achieve comparable
hit rate with set-associative cache. Compared with the state-of-the-art
baselines, i.e., enhanced Loh-Hill cache, Gemini improves the IPC by up to 20%
respectively.

chatbots, help users achieve a predefined goal (e.g. book a movie ticket)
within a closed domain. A first step is to understand the user's goal by using
natural language understanding techniques. Once the goal is known, the bot must
manage a dialogue to achieve that goal, which is conducted with respect to a
learnt policy. The success of the dialogue system depends on the quality of the
policy, which is in turn reliant on the availability of high-quality training
data for the policy learning method, for instance Deep Reinforcement Learning.
  Due to the domain specificity, the amount of available data is typically too
low to allow the training of good dialogue policies. In this master thesis we
introduce a transfer learning method to mitigate the effects of the low
in-domain data availability. Our transfer learning based approach improves the
bot's success rate by $20\%$ in relative terms for distant domains and we more
than double it for close domains, compared to the model without transfer
learning. Moreover, the transfer learning chatbots learn the policy up to 5 to
10 times faster. Finally, as the transfer learning approach is complementary to
additional processing such as warm-starting, we show that their joint
application gives the best outcomes.

OTOC functions. We apply this circuit to measure OTOC and hence the quantum

and the evolution of cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma game. Rather than
pre-assigning zero-or-one interaction rate, we diversify the rate of
interaction by associating it with the phenotypes shared in common. Individuals
each carry a set of potentially expressible phenotypes and expresses a certain
number of phenotypes at a cost proportional to the number. The number of
expressed phenotypes and thus the rate of interaction is an evolvable trait.
Our results show that nonnegligible cost of expressing phenotypes restrains
phenotype expression, and the evolutionary race mainly proceeds on between
cooperative strains and defective strains who express a very few phenotypes. It
pays for cooperative strains to express a very few phenotypes. Though such a
low level of expression weakens reciprocity between cooperative strains, it
decelerates rate of interaction between cooperative strains and defective
strains to a larger degree, leading to the predominance of cooperative strains
over defective strains. We also find that evolved diversity of phenotype
expression can occasionally destabilize due to the invasion of defective
mutants, implying that cooperation and diversity of phenotype expression can
mutually reinforce each other. Therefore, our results provide new insights into
better understanding the coevolution of cooperation and the diversity of
phenotype expression.

laws and tax treaties, has been forced to work as a single network. However,
each jurisdiction (country or region) has not made its economic law under the

brought unexpected results. We thought that the results are exactly
international tax avoidance. To contribute to the solution of international tax
avoidance, we tried to investigate which part of the network is vulnerable.
Specifically, focusing on treaty shopping, which is one of international tax
avoidance methods, we attempt to identified which jurisdiction are likely to be
used for treaty shopping from tax liabilities and the relationship between
jurisdictions which are likely to be used for treaty shopping and others. For
that purpose, based on withholding tax rates imposed on dividends, interest,

computed the centralities and detected the communities. As a result, we
clarified the jurisdictions that are likely to be used for treaty shopping and
pointed out that there are community structures. The results of this study
suggested that fewer jurisdictions need to introduce more regulations for
prevention of treaty abuse worldwide.

allows to overcome the major limitation of recent rigidity-based approaches

While the problem of securing word-level embeddings is very well studied, we
propose a novel method for obtaining sentence-level embeddings. This is
obtained by a simple method in the context of solving the paraphrase generation
task. If we use a sequential encoder-decoder model for generating paraphrase,
we would like the generated paraphrase to be semantically close to the original
sentence. One way to ensure this is by adding constraints for true paraphrase
embeddings to be close and unrelated paraphrase candidate sentence embeddings
to be far. This is ensured by using a sequential pair-wise discriminator that
shares weights with the encoder that is trained with a suitable loss function.
Our loss function penalizes paraphrase sentence embedding distances from being
too large. This loss is used in combination with a sequential encoder-decoder
network. We also validated our method by evaluating the obtained embeddings for
a sentiment analysis task. The proposed method results in semantic embeddings
and outperforms the state-of-the-art on the paraphrase generation and sentiment
analysis task on standard datasets. These results are also shown to be
statistically significant.

  Wideband Massive MIMO","14 two-column pages; submitted to IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of excessive pilot overhead required for uplink massive MIMO
channel estimation is well known, let alone when it is considered along with
wideband (OFDM) transmissions. Towards channel estimators that are both
efficient and require low-training overhead, compressive sensing (CS)
approaches have been increasingly popular, exploiting the sparse nature of the
physical channel. However, no analytical insights regarding the overhead
required for reliable channel estimation in wideband massive MIMO are
available. By observing that the wideband massive MIMO channel can be
represented by a vector that is not simply sparse but has well defined
structural properties, referred to as hierarchical sparsity, we propose low
complexity channel estimators for the multiuser scenario that take this
property into account. By employing the framework of the hierarchical
restricted isometry property, rigorous performance guarantees for these
algorithms are provided suggesting concrete design goals for the user pilot
sequences. For a specific design, we analytically characterize the scaling of
the required pilot overhead with increasing number of antennas and bandwidth,
revealing that, as long as the number of antennas is sufficiently large, it is
independent of the per user channel sparsity level as well as the number of
active users. Hence, surprisingly, in contrast to the classical setting, pilot
overhead can be shifted into spatial dimensions not affecting crucial bandwidth
constraints thereby increasing the overall system capacity. These analytical
insights are verified by simulation results demonstrating also the superiority
of the proposed algorithm over conventional CS algorithms that ignore the
hierarchical sparsity property.

Constructing a cavity model with two such detector mirrors, we can see how the

of negative energy regions, it might, for example, be possible to produce
exotic phenomena such as Lorentzian transversable wormholes, warp drives, time
machines, violations of the second law of thermodynamics, and naked
singularities. Quantum Inequalities (QIs) have been proposed that restrict the
size and duration of the regions of negative quantum vacuum energy that can be
accessed by observers. However, QIs generally are derived for situations in
cosmology and are very difficult to test. Direct measurement of vacuum energy
is difficult and to date no QI has been tested experimentally. We test a
proposed QI for squeezed light by a meta-analysis of published data obtained
from experiments with optical parametric amplifiers (OPA) and balanced homodyne
detection. Over that last three decades, researchers in quantum optics have
been trying to maximize the squeezing of light and the quantum vacuum and have
succeeded in reducing the variance in the quantum vacuum fluctuations to -15
dB. To apply the QI, a time sampling function is required. In our meta-analysis
different time sampling functions for the QI were examined, but in all
physically reasonable cases the QI is violated by much or all of the measured

Small satellites, deployed as a sensor network in space, can through
inter-satellite communication (ISC) enable the realization of these future
goals. Developing the communication subsystem that can facilitate ISC within
this distributed network of small satellites require a complex range of design
trade-offs. For small satellites, the general design parameters that are to be
optimized for ISC are size, mass, and power, as well as cost (SMaP-C). Novel
and efficient design techniques for implementing the communication subsystem
are crucial for building multiple small satellite networks with capability for
achieving significant data-rates along the inter-satellite links (ISLs). In
this paper, we propose an alternative approach to RF and laser ISLs for ISC
among small satellites deployed as a sensor network in low Earth orbit (LEO).
For short to medium range ISLs, we present an LED-based visible light
communication (VLC) system that addresses the SMaP constraints, including
capability for achieving significant data rates. Our research is focused on the
development of the physical layer for pico-/nano class of satellites with prime
consideration for the impact of solar background illumination on link
performance. We develop an analytical model of the inter-satellite link (ISL)

modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) schemes.

optimum DSP is derived in the sense that it minimizes the Bayes risk. In terms
of the Bayes risks, it performs better than Lam's sampling plan and its
performance is as good as the Bayesian sampling plan of \cite{LLH:2002},
although implementation of the DSP is very simple. Analytically it is more
tractable than the Bayesian sampling plan of \cite{LLH:2002}, and it can be
