that combine electrical and mechanical components on a common substrate. Here,
the electrostatic-elastic case is considered, where an elastic membrane is
allowed to deflect above a ground plate under the action of an electric
potential, whose strength is proportional to a parameter $\lambda$. Such
devices are commonly described by a parabolic partial differential equation
that contains a singular nonlinear source term. The singularity in that term
corresponds to the so-called ""touchdown"" phenomenon, where the membrane
establishes contact with the ground plate. Touchdown is known to imply the
non-existence of steady state solutions and blow-up of solutions in finite
time. We study a recently proposed extension of that canonical model, where
such singularities are avoided due to the introduction of a regularizing term
involving a small ""regularization"" parameter $\varepsilon$. Methods from
dynamical systems and geometric singular perturbation theory, in particular the
desingularization technique known as ""blow-up"", allow for a precise description
of steady-state solutions of the regularized model, as well as for a detailed
resolution of the resulting bifurcation diagram. The interplay between the two
main model parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\lambda$ is emphasized; in particular,
the focus is on the singular limit as both parameters tend to zero.

compared with centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) to assess the importance of
non-centroid fluctuations. Above 250 K, only the lowest-frequency non-centroid

250 K, more non-centroid modes are needed to correct large CMD red-shifts and

a promising emerging sensor technology for a vast variety of applications in

problem is to describe the radiation pattern of multi-mode antennas in closed
analytic form based on calibration measurements or on electromagnetic field
(EMF) simulation data. As a solution, we investigate two modeling methods: One
is based on the array interpolation technique (AIT), the other one on wavefield
modeling (WM). Both methods are able to accurately interpolate quantized EMF
data of a given multi-mode antenna, in our case a planar four-port antenna
developed for the 6-8.5 GHz range. Since the modeling methods inherently depend
on parameter sets, we investigate the influence of the parameter choice on the
accuracy of both models. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of modeling errors
for coherent maximum-likelihood direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation given
different model parameters. Numerical results are presented for a single
polarization component. Simulations reveal that the estimation bias introduced
by model errors is subject to the chosen model parameters. Finally, we provide
optimized sets of AIT and WM parameters for the multi-mode antenna under
investigation. With these parameter sets, EMF data samples can be reproduced in
interpolated form with high angular resolution.

specifically, an encoder-decoder fully convolutional neural network
architecture is trained to automatically learn how to leverage the

typically cover an interval of tens of hours, which is comparable to the
typical rotation period of asteroids. The search for best-fitting models was

X-ray and $\gamma$-ray polarizations both for the average and elevated activity

higher degree of high energy polarization compared to leptonic ones, and (ii)
the X-ray polarization degree is higher than the $\gamma$-ray polarization in
the leptonic scenario, but similar to the $\gamma$-ray polarization if the
observed radiation is powered by hadronic processes. From the leptonic
modeling, the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region is found to be at
the outer edge of the broad line region (BLR) and is consistent with the
$\gamma\gamma$ opacity estimates for the $\gamma$-ray absorption by the BLR. We
conclude that a majority of the FSRQs could be detected by the upcoming

combining an effective field theory approach with a dynamical-systems analysis.
In this approach, we construct an expansion for the potential-like term in the
effective action as a function of time, rather than specifying a particular
functional dependence on a scalar field. We may then identify fixed points in
the effective phase space for such systems, order-by-order, as various
constraints are placed on the $M$th time derivative of the potential-like
function. For relatively simple systems, we find significant probability for
the background spacetime to flow into an inflationary state, and for inflation
to persist for at least 60 efolds. Moreover, for systems that are compatible
with single-scalar-field realizations, we find a single, universal functional
form for the effective potential, $V (\phi)$, which is similar to the
well-studied potential for power-law inflation. We discuss the compatibility of
such dynamical systems with observational constraints.

exploration/exploitation problems and are widely used in applications such as
online marketing and recommendation. One of the main challenges faced by
practitioners hoping to apply existing algorithms is that usually the feedback
is randomly delayed and delays are only partially observable. For example,
while a purchase is usually observable some time after the display, the
decision of not buying is never explicitly sent to the system. In other words,
the learner only observes delayed positive events. We formalize this problem as
a novel stochastic delayed linear bandit and propose ${\tt OTFLinUCB}$ and
${\tt OTFLinTS}$, two computationally efficient algorithms able to integrate
new information as it becomes available and to deal with the permanently
censored feedback. We prove optimal $\tilde O(\smash{d\sqrt{T}})$ bounds on the
regret of the first algorithm and study the dependency on delay-dependent
parameters. Our model, assumptions and results are validated by experiments on
simulated and real data.

is a long-standing conundrum. I describe three insights into the transition
from quantum to classical that are based on the recognition of the role of the
environment. I begin with derivation of preferred sets of states that help
define what exists - our everyday classical reality. They emerge as a result of
breaking of the unitary symmetry of the Hilbert space which happens when the
unitarity of quantum evolutions encounters nonlinearities inherent in the
process of amplification - of replicating information. This derivation is
accomplished without the usual tools of decoherence, and accounts for the
appearance of quantum jumps and emergence of preferred pointer states
consistent with those obtained via environment-induced superselection, or
einselection. Pointer states obtained this way determine what can happen -
define events - without appealing to Born's rule for probabilities. Therefore,
Born's rule can be now deduced from the entanglement-assisted invariance, or
envariance - a symmetry of entangled quantum states. With probabilities at hand
one also gains new insights into foundations of quantum statistical physics.
Moreover, one can now analyze information flows responsible for decoherence.
These information flows explain how perception of objective classical reality
arises from the quantum substrate: Effective amplification they represent
accounts for the objective existence of the einselected states of macroscopic
quantum systems through the redundancy of pointer state records in their
environment - through quantum Darwinism.

BL Lac objects. We study the multi-frequency emission in order to investigate

to other VHE gamma-ray emitting (TeV) blazars. We performed a temporal and
spectral analysis of the data centred around the MAGIC interval of observation
(MJD 57225-57231). Long-term radio and optical data have also been investigated
using the discrete correlation function. The redshift of the source is
estimated through optical host-galaxy imaging and also using the amount of VHE
gamma-ray absorption. The quasi-simultaneous multi-frequency spectral energy
distribution (SED) is modelled with the conventional one-zone synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) model. MAGIC observations resulted in the detection of the
source at a significance level of $5.3\,\sigma$. The VHE gamma-ray emission of
S2 0109+22 is variable on a daily time scale. VHE gamma-ray luminosity of the
source is lower than the average of TeV BL Lacs. The optical polarization, and
long-term optical/radio behaviour of the source are different from the general
population of TeV blazars. All these findings agree with the classification of
the source as an ISP BL Lac object. We estimate the source redshift as $z =
0.36 \pm 0.07$. The SSC parameters describing the SED are rather typical for
blazars.

Chariklo were announced. This was the first time that such structures were
found around a small body. In 2015, it was proposed that the Centaur (2060)
Chiron may also have a ring. In a previous study, we analyzed how close
encounters with giant planets would affect the rings of Chariklo. The most
likely result is the survival of the rings. In the present work, we broaden our
analysis to (2060) Chiron. In addition to Chariklo, Chiron is currently the
only known Centaur with a presumed ring. By applying the same method as
\cite{araujo2016}, we performed numerical integrations of a system composed of
729 clones of Chiron, the Sun, and the giant planets. The number of close
encounters that disrupted the ring of Chiron during one half-life of the study
period was computed. This number was then compared to the number of close
encounters for Chariklo. We found that the probability of Chiron losing its
ring due to close encounters with the giant planets is about six times higher
than that for Chariklo. Our analysis showed that, unlike Chariklo, Chiron is
more likely to remain in an orbit with a relatively low inclination and high
eccentricity. Thus, we found that the bodies in Chiron-like orbits are less
likely to retain rings than those in Chariklo-like orbits. Overall, for
observational purposes, we conclude that the bigger bodies in orbits with high
inclinations and low eccentricities should be prioritized.

profile parameters over traditional optimisation algorithms. We apply PHI to a
sample of synthetic galaxies with SDSS-like image properties to investigate the
effect of galaxy properties on our ability to recover unbiased and well
constrained structural parameters. In two-component bulge+disc galaxies we find
that the bulge structural parameters are recovered less well than those of the
disc, particularly when the bulge contributes a lower fraction to the
luminosity, or is barely resolved with respect to the pixel scale or PSF. There
are few systematic biases, apart from for bulge+disc galaxies with large bulge
Sersic parameter, n. On application to SDSS images, we find good agreement with
other codes, when run on the same images with the same masks, weights, and PSF.
Again, we find that bulge parameters are the most difficult to constrain

effects of inertial particles on self-sustained, turbulent coherent structures
(i.e. the so-called the regeneration cycle) in plane Couette flow at low
Reynolds number just above the onset of transition. Tests show two limiting
behaviors with increasing particle inertia, similar to the results from the
linear stability analysis of saffman, 1962: low-inertia particles trigger the
laminar-to-turbulent instability whereas high-inertia particles tend to
stabilize turbulence due to the extra dissipation induced by particle-fluid
coupling. Furthermore, it is found that the streamwise coupling between phases
is the dominant factor in damping the turbulence and is highly related to the
spatial distribution of the particles. The presence of particles in different
turbulent coherent structures (large scale vortices or large scale streaks)
determines the turbulent kinetic energy of particulate phase, which is related
to the particle response time scaled by the turnover time of large scale
vortices. By quantitatively investigating the periodic character of the whole
regeneration cycle and the phase difference between linked sub-steps, we show
that the presence of inertial particles does not alter the periodic nature of
the cycle or the relative length of each of the sub-steps. Instead,
high-inertia particles greatly weaken the large-scale vortices as well as the
streamwise vorticity stretching and lift-up effects, thereby suppressing the
fluctuating amplitude of the large scale streaks. The primary influence of
low-inertia particles, however, is to strengthen the large scale vortices,
which fosters the cycle and ultimately reduces the critical Reynolds number.

rotation maps at $z=0$ for a set of disk galaxies from the Auriga
high-resolution cosmological simulations, for different observer positions

rotation of our simulated galaxies for a hypothetic observer at the solar

The same holds for an observer outside the galaxy and the observed signal of
the nearby spiral galaxy M51. However, we also find that the structure and
angular power spectra of the synthetic all-sky Faraday rotation maps vary
strongly with azimuthal position along the solar circle. We argue that this
variation is a result of the structure of the magnetic field of the galaxy that
is dominated by an azimuthal magnetic field ordered scales of several kpc, but
has radial and vertical magnetic field components that are only ordered on
scales of 1-2 kpc. Because the magnetic field strength decreases exponentially
with height above the disk, the Faraday rotation for an observer at the solar

for attempts to reconstruct the global magnetic field of the Milky Way from
Faraday rotation maps alone without including additional observables.

continuum polarisation, and find P$_{\rm cont}$ < 0.077 percent and P$_{\rm

derive upper limits on the rotation of our WO stars by considering our results
in the context of the wind compression effect. We estimate that for an edge-on

found on v$_{\rm rot}$/v$_{\rm crit}$ and log(j) for our WO stars are therefore
similar to the estimates calculated for Galactic WR stars that do show a line

indicative of fast rotation, the absence of a line effect does not rule out
significant rotation, even when considering the edge-on scenario.

few hundred Myr and persists even at late cosmic times. One prediction of this
quasi-periodic, galactic-scale ""breathing"" is an $anti$-correlation between
star formation rate (SFR) and half-light radius as central gas overdensities
lead to starbursts whose feedback drags stars to larger radii while star
formation dwindles. We test this prediction with a sample of 322 $isolated$
IMGs with stellar masses of $10^{9.0} \leq M/M_{\odot} \leq 10^{9.5}$ at
$0.3<z<0.4$ in the HST $I_{814}$ COSMOS footprint. We find that IMGs with
higher specific SFRs (SSFR $>10^{-10}$ yr$^{-1}$) are the most extended with
median sizes of $R_e \sim 3-3.4$ kpc and are mostly disk-dominated systems. In
contrast, IMGs with lower SSFRs ($<10^{-10}$ yr$^{-1}$) are a factor of $\sim

significant bulge contributions to their light. These observed trends are
opposite the predictions for stellar feedback that operate via the ""breathing""

stellar feedback in IMGs that drastically changes their predicted formation

surveys investigating dark matter and dark energy, such as Euclid or WFIRST.
The probe requires an extremely accurate measurement of the shapes of millions
of galaxies based on imaging data. Crucially, the shear measurement must
address and compensate for a range of interwoven nuisance effects related to
the instrument optics and detector, noise, unknown galaxy morphologies, colors,
blending of sources, and selection effects. This paper explores the use of
supervised machine learning (ML) as a tool to solve this inverse problem. We
present a simple architecture that learns to regress shear point estimates and
weights via shallow artificial neural networks. The networks are trained on
simulations of the forward observing process, and take combinations of moments
of the galaxy images as inputs. A challenging peculiarity of this ML
application is the combination of the noisiness of the input features and the
requirements on the accuracy of the inverse regression. To address this issue,
the proposed training algorithm minimizes bias over multiple realizations of
individual source galaxies, reducing the sensitivity to properties of the
overall sample of source galaxies. Importantly, an observational selection
function of these source galaxies can be straightforwardly taken into account
via the weights. We first introduce key aspects of our approach using toy-model
simulations, and then demonstrate its potential on images mimicking Euclid
data. Finally, we analyze images from the GREAT3 challenge, obtaining
competitively low shear biases despite the use of a simple training set. We
conclude that the further development of ML approaches is of high interest to
meet the stringent requirements on the shear measurement in current and future
surveys. A demonstration implementation of our technique is publicly available.

achieved in ILC- and CLIC-like operating scenarios yields individual limits on
the electroweak couplings of the top quark that are one to three orders of
magnitude better than constraints set with Tevatron and LHC run I data, and
three to two hundred times better than the most optimistic projections made for
the high-luminosity phase of the LHC. Clean global constraints can moreover be
obtained at lepton colliders, robustly covering the multidimensional
effective-field-theory space with minimal model dependence.

and exciting science such as: (1) measuring the event horizon scale structure
in AGN accretion disks and the spins of supermassive black holes through
observations of gravitationally-microlensed quasars; (ii) determining AGN and
starburst feedback in galaxies and galaxy clusters through direct imaging of
winds and interaction of jets and via spatially resolved imaging of galaxies at
high-z; (iii) fueling of AGN by probing the Bondi radius of over 20 nearby
galaxies; (iv) hierarchical structure formation and the SMBH merger rate
through measurement of the occurrence rate of dual AGN and occupation fraction
of SMBHs; (v) advancing SNR physics and galaxy ecology through large detailed
samples of SNR in nearby galaxies; (vi) measuring the Cosmic Web through its
connection to cluster outskirts; (vii) a wide variety of time domain science

gravitational waves: their polarizations, dispersion, speed, and, importantly,
energy content are all heavily theory- dependent. All these corrections can
potentially be probed by measuring the stochastic gravitational- wave
background. However, most existing treatments of this background beyond GR
overlook modifications to the energy carried by gravitational waves, or rely on
GR assumptions that are invalid in other theories. This may lead to
mistranslation between the observable cross-correlation of detector outputs and
gravitational-wave energy density, and thus to errors when deriving
observational constraints on theories. In this article, we lay out a generic
formalism for stochastic gravitational- wave searches, applicable to a large
family of theories beyond GR. We explicitly state the (often tacit) assumptions
that go into these searches, evaluating their generic applicability, or lack
thereof. Examples of problematic assumptions are: statistical independence of
linear polarization amplitudes; which polarizations satisfy equipartition; and
which polarizations have well-defined phase velocities. We also show how to
correctly infer the value of the stochastic energy density in the context of
any given theory. We demonstrate with specific theories in which some of the
traditional assumptions break down: Chern-Simons gravity, scalar-tensor theory,
and Fierz-Pauli massive gravity. In each theory, we show how to properly
include the beyond-GR corrections, and how to interpret observational results.

symmetrical due to large zero-point fluctuations of the H positions. In this

states. We propose that the emergence of such states plays a fundamental role

different patterns of synchronization across predefined cognitive systems. We
then analyze these emergent patterns within our novel framework to understand
the impact of subject-specific and region-specific structural variability on
brain dynamics. Our results suggest a classification of cognitive systems into
four groups with differing levels of subject and regional variability that

recollections on operad theory, model categories, simplicial homotopy theory,

second part deals with the theory of convolution algebras and some of their
applications, as explained below.
  Suppose we are given a type of algebras, a type of coalgebras, and a
relationship between those types of algebraic structures (encoded by an operad,
a cooperad, and a twisting morphism respectively). Then, it is possible to
endow the space of linear maps from a coalgebra C and an algebra A with a
natural structure of Lie algebra up to homotopy. We call the resulting homotopy
Lie algebra the convolution algebra of A and C. We study the theory of
convolution algebras and their compatibility with the tools of homotopical
algebra: infinity morphisms and the homotopy transfer theorem. After doing
that, we apply this theory to various domains, such as derived deformation
theory and rational homotopy theory. In the first case, we use the tools we
developed to construct an universal Lie algebra representing the space of
Maurer-Cartan elements, a fundamental object of deformation theory. In the
second case, we generalize a result of Berglund on rational models for mapping
spaces between pointed topological spaces. In the last chapter of this thesis,
we give a new approach to two important theorems in deformation theory: the
Goldman-Millson theorem and the Dolgushev-Rogers theorem.

convenient but subject to two major issues: (1) inference is global and
requires top-level annotations, making it unsuitable for inference of modular
code components and prohibiting its applicability to library code, and (2)
inference failure results in obscure error messages. These difficulties
seriously hamper the migration of existing code to use refinements. This paper
shows that gradual liquid type inference---a novel combination of liquid
inference and gradual refinement types---addresses both issues. Gradual
refinement types, which support imprecise predicates that are optimistically
interpreted, can be used in argument positions to constrain liquid inference so
that the global inference process e effectively infers modular specifications
usable for library components. Dually, when gradual refinements appear as the
result of inference, they signal an inconsistency in the use of static
refinements. Because liquid refinements are drawn from a nite set of
predicates, in gradual liquid type inference we can enumerate the safe
concretizations of each imprecise refinement, i.e. the static refinements that
justify why a program is gradually well-typed. This enumeration is useful for
static liquid type error explanation, since the safe concretizations exhibit
all the potential inconsistencies that lead to static type errors. We develop
the theory of gradual liquid type inference and explore its pragmatics in the

many theories which add an extra massive scalar degree of freedom to General

This is widely studied. Selective segmentation, less studied, aims to use
limited user specified information to extract one or more interesting objects

both classes of model. However our primary concern is on selective
segmentation. In this work, we develop an effective multigrid algorithm, based
on a new non-standard smoother to deal with non-smooth coefficients, to solve
the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) of a class of variational
segmentation models in the level set formulation. For such models,
non-smoothness (or jumps) is typical as segmentation is only possible if edges
(jumps) are present. In comparison with previous multigrid methods which were
shown to produce an acceptable {\it mean} smoothing rate for related models,
the new algorithm can ensure a small and {\it global} smoothing rate that is a
sufficient condition for convergence. Our rate analysis is by Local Fourier
Analysis and, with it, we design the corresponding iterative solver, improving
on an ineffective line smoother. Numerical tests show that the new algorithm
outperforms multigrid methods based on competing smoothers.

due to a constant gravity acceleration. This allows the study of slow
magnetoacoustic cut-off periods across the solar transition region, from the
base of the solar chromosphere to the lower corona. The used temperature
profile approaches the VAC solar atmospheric model. The periods obtained are
consistent with observations. Similar to the acoustic cut-off periods, the
resulting magnetoacoustic gravity ones follow the sharp temperature profile,
but shifted towards larger heights; in other words, at a given height the
magnetoacoustic cut-off period is significantly lower than the corresponding
acoustic one. Along a given longitude of an inclined thin magnetic tube, the
greater its inclination the softener the temperature gradient it crosses.
Changes in the magnetic field intensity do not significantly modify the periods
at the coronal level but modulate the values below the transition region within
periods between $\sim [2\,- 6]\,$min. Within the limitations of our model, we
show that monochromatic oscillations of the solar atmosphere are the
atmospheric response at its natural frequency to random or impulsive
perturbations, and not a consequence of the forcing from the photosphere.

Collating gradients from the literature, we show that the gradients in the
metal-rich and metal-poor GC subpopulations are the same, within measurement
uncertainties, in a given galaxy. Furthermore, these GC gradients are similar
in strength to the {\it stellar} metallicity gradient of the host galaxy. At
the very largest radii (e.g. greater than 8 galaxy effective radii) there is
some evidence that the GC gradients become flat with near constant mean
metallicity. Using stellar metallicity gradients as a proxy, we probe the
assembly histories of massive early-type galaxies with hydrodynamical
simulations from the Magneticum suite of models. In particular, we measure the
stellar metallicity gradient for the in-situ and accreted components over a
similar radial range as those observed for GC subpopulations. We find that the
in-situ and accreted stellar metallicity gradients are similar but have a
larger scatter than the metal-rich and metal-poor GC subpopulations gradients

intensity correction of images from breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) acquired by different MRI scanners with various
imaging parameters, using only image information. Methods: DCE-MR images of 460
subjects with breast cancer acquired by different scanners were used in this
study. Each subject had one T1-weighted pre-contrast image and three
T1-weighted post-contrast images available. Our normalization algorithm
operated under the assumption that the same type of tissue in different
patients should be represented by the same voxel value. We used four
tissue/material types as the anchors for the normalization: 1) air, 2) fat
tissue, 3) dense tissue, and 4) heart. The algorithm proceeded in the following
two steps: First, a state-of-the-art deep learning-based algorithm was applied
to perform tissue segmentation accurately and efficiently. Then, based on the
segmentation results, a subject-specific piecewise linear mapping function was
applied between the anchor points to normalize the same type of tissue in
different patients into the same intensity ranges. We evaluated the algorithm
with 300 subjects used for training and the rest used for testing. Results: The
application of our algorithm to images with different scanning parameters
resulted in highly improved consistency in pixel values and extracted radiomics
features. Conclusion: The proposed image normalization strategy based on tissue
segmentation can perform intensity correction fully automatically, without the
knowledge of the scanner parameters. Significance: We have thoroughly tested
our algorithm and showed that it successfully normalizes the intensity of
DCE-MR images. We made our software publicly available for others to apply in
their analyses.

the biological processes such as metabolic pathways, DNA replication, and

Interaction (PPI) systems are dependent primarily on the scientific literature,
which is yet not accessible as a structured database. Thus, efficient
information extraction systems are required for identifying PPI information
from the large collection of biomedical texts. Most of the existing systems
model the PPI extraction task as a classification problem and are tailored to
the handcrafted feature set including domain dependent features. In this paper,
we present a novel method based on deep bidirectional long short-term memory
(B-LSTM) technique that exploits word sequences and dependency path related
information to identify PPI information from text. This model leverages joint
modeling of proteins and relations in a single unified framework, which we name
as Shortest Dependency Path B-LSTM (sdpLSTM) model. We perform experiments on
two popular benchmark PPI datasets, namely AiMed & BioInfer. The evaluation
shows the F1-score values of 86.45% and 77.35% on AiMed and BioInfer,
respectively. Comparisons with the existing systems show that our proposed

charge gets fractionalized into two parts: a microscopic core with half-integer
charge and a critically large halo carrying a complementary charge of $\pm
1/2$. The halon phenomenon emerges when the impurity--environment interaction
is fine-tuned to the vicinity of a boundary quantum critical point (BQCP), at
which the energies of two quasiparticle states with adjacent integer charges
approach each other. The universality class of such BQCP is captured by a model
of pseudo-spin-$1/2$ impurity coupled to the quantum-critical environment, in
such a way that the rotational symmetry in the pseudo-spin $xy$-plane is
respected, with a small local ""magnetic"" field along the pseudo-spin $z$-axis
playing the role of control parameter driving the system away from the BQCP. On
the approach to BQCP, the half-integer projection of the pseudo-spin on its
$z$-axis gets delocalized into a halo of critically divergent radius, capturing
the essence of the phenomenon of charge fractionalization. With large-scale
Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the existence of halons---and quantify

well-established, similar paradigms. Both schemes have been studied when the
Gauss-Newton model is replaced by a random model that is only accurate with a
given probability. Trust-region schemes have also been applied to problems
where the objective value is subject to noise: this setting is of particular
interest in fields such as data assimilation, where efficient methods that can
adapt to noise are needed to account for the intrinsic uncertainty in the input

  In this paper, we describe a stochastic Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm that
handles noisy objective function values and random models, provided sufficient
accuracy is achieved in probability. Our method relies on a specific scaling of
the regularization parameter, that allows us to leverage existing results for
trust-region algorithms. Moreover, we exploit the structure of our objective
through the use of a family of stationarity criteria tailored to least-squares
problems. Provided the probability of accurate function estimates and models is
sufficiently large, we bound the expected number of iterations needed to reach
an approximate stationary point, which generalizes results based on using
deterministic models or noiseless function values. We illustrate the link

magnetic thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy shaped as a circular
indentation. We show that in addition to the topologically trivial ground
state, there are two skyrmion states with winding numbers $\pm 1$ and a
skyrmionium state with a winding number $0$. These chiral states are formed due
to the pinning of a chiral magnetic domain wall at a bend of the
nanoindentation due to spatial inhomogeneity of the curvature-induced
Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. The latter emerges due to the gradient of
the local curvature at a bend. While the chirality of the skyrmion is
determined by the sign of the local curvature, its radius can be varied in a
broad range by engineering the position of the bend with respect to the center

reduce a magnetic problem for any surface of revolution to the common planar

interactive applications (e.g., Web Search) demand low tail latency for their
short messages due to their partition-aggregate software architecture, many
data-intensive applications (e.g., Map-Reduce) require high throughput for long
flows as they move vast amounts of data across the network. Recent proposals
improve latency of short flows and throughput of long flows by addressing the
shortcomings of existing packet scheduling and congestion control algorithms,
respectively. We make the key observation that long tails in the Flow
Completion Times (FCT) of short flows result from packets that suffer
congestion at more than one switch along their paths in the network. Our
proposal, Slytherin, specifically targets packets that suffered from congestion
at multiple points and prioritizes them in the network. Slytherin leverages ECN
mechanism which is widely used in existing datacenters to identify such tail
packets and dynamically prioritizes them using existing priority queues. As
compared to existing state-of-the-art packet scheduling proposals, Slytherin
achieves 18.6% lower 99th percentile flow completion times for short flows
without any loss of throughput. Further, Slytherin drastically reduces 99th
percentile queue length in switches by a factor of about 2x on average.

physical motivations is proposed. This equation is obtained from a special
reduction of the Manakov system, and it describes Manakov solutions whose two
components are related by a parity symmetry. Since the Manakov system governs
wave propagation in a wide variety of physical systems, this new nonlocal
equation has clear physical meanings. Solitons and multi-solitons in this
nonlocal equation are also investigated in the framework of Riemann-Hilbert
formulations. Surprisingly, symmetry relations of discrete scattering data for
this equation are found to be very complicated, where constraints between
eigenvectors in the scattering data depend on the number and locations of the
underlying discrete eigenvalues in a very complex manner. As a consequence,
general $N$-solitons are difficult to obtain in the Riemann-Hilbert framework.
However, one- and two-solitons are derived, and their dynamics investigated. It
is found that two-solitons are generally not a nonlinear superposition of
one-solitons, and they exhibit interesting dynamics such as meandering and
sudden position shifts. As a generalization, other integrable and physically
meaningful nonlocal equations are also proposed, which include NLS equations of
reverse-time and reverse-space-time types as well as nonlocal Manakov equations
of reverse-space, reverse-time and reverse-space-time types.

transfer of the complexity from the UV to the IR in holographic CFTs, which is
reminiscent of thermalization behavior deduced using holography. It also
naturally gives a second law for the complexity when applied at a black hole

an extensive number of ground state spin configurations, whereas magnetic

these ground states. Introducing quantum fluctuations into the model induces
monopoles with dynamics, which would normally lift the degeneracy of the

this expectation, we find that quantum fluctuations in the form of a locally

roughness elements can stabilize disturbances inside a hypersonic boundary
layer, and eventually delay the transition onset. The objective of this paper
is to evaluate the response of disturbances propagating inside a high-speed
boundary layer to various two-dimensional surface deformations of different
shapes. We perform an assessment of the impact of various two-dimensional
surface non-uniformities, such as backward or forward steps, combinations of
backward and forward steps, wavy surfaces, surface dips, and surface humps.
Disturbances inside a Mach 5.92 flat-plate boundary layer are excited using
periodic wall blowing and suction at an upstream location. The numerical tools
consist of a high-accurate numerical algorithm solving for the unsteady,
compressible form of the Navier-Stokes equations in curvilinear coordinates.
Results show that all types of surface non-uniformities are able to reduce the
amplitude of boundary layer disturbances to a certain degree. The amount of
disturbance energy reduction is related to the type of pressure gradients that
are posed by the deformation (adverse or favorable). A possible cause (among
others) of the disturbance energy reduction inside the boundary layer is
presumed to be the result of a partial deviation of the kinetic energy to the
external flow, along the discontinuity that is generated by the wall
deformation.

subregularity which, in contrast to its siblings, metric regularity, strong
regularity and strong subregularity, exhibits a more complicated behavior under
various perturbations. We consider three kinds of perturbations: by Lipschitz
continuous functions, by semismooth functions, and by smooth functions,
obtaining different expressions/bounds for the radius of subregularity, which
involve generalized derivatives of set-valued mappings. We also obtain
different expressions when using either Frobenius or Euclidean norm to measure

telescopes observing the microwave sky from the South Pole. They target the
degree-scale B-mode polarization signal imprinted in the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) by primordial gravitational waves. Such a measurement would
shed light on the physics of the very early universe. While BICEP2 observed for
the first time a B-mode signal at 150 GHz, higher frequencies from the Planck
satellite showed that it could be entirely due to the polarized emission from
Galactic dust, though uncertainty remained high. Keck Array has been observing
the same region of the sky for several years, with an increased detector count,
producing the deepest polarized CMB maps to date. New detectors at 95 GHz were
installed in 2014, and at 220 GHz in 2015. These observations enable a better
constraint of galactic foreground emissions, as presented here. In 2015, BICEP2
was replaced by BICEP3, a 10 times higher throughput telescope observing at 95
GHz, while Keck Array is now focusing on higher frequencies. In the near
future, BICEP Array will replace Keck Array, and will allow unprecedented
sensitivity to the gravitational wave signal. High resolution observations from
the South Pole Telescope (SPT) will also be used to remove the lensing
contribution to B-modes.

based on a set of network requirements. Programming the networks using SDN is
not completely straightforward because a programmer must deal with low level
details. To solve the problem, researchers proposed a set of network
programming languages that provide a set of high level abstractions to hide low
level hardware details. Most of the proposed languages provide abstractions
related to packet processing and flows, and still require a programmer to
specify low-level match-action fields to configure and monitor a network.
Recently, in an attempt to raise the level at which programmers work,
researchers have begun to investigate Intent-based, descriptive northbound
interfaces. The work is still in early stages, and further investigation is
required before intent-based systems will be adopted by enterprise networks. To
help achieve the goal of moving to an intent-based design, we propose an
SDN-based network programming framework, the Open Software Defined Framework
(OSDF). OSDF provides a high level Application Programming Interface (API) that
can be used by managers and network administrators to express network
requirements for applications and policies for multiple domains. OSDF also
provides a set of high level network operation services that handle common
network configuration, monitoring, and Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning.
OSDF is equipped with a policy conflict management module to help a network
administrator detect and resolve policy conflicts. The paper shows how OSDF can
be used and explains application-based policies. Finally, the paper reports the
results of both testbed measurements and simulations that are used to evaluate
the framework from multiple perspectives, including functionality and
performance.

the required thermopower of ANE for practical energy harvesting applications is
evaluated in simulations of electric power obtainable from ANE using a

can be detected in Chamaeleon when gas column densities in the DNM were
inferred and CO emission was not detected. % methods We took 3mm absorption
profiles of HCO+ and other molecules toward quasars across Chamaeleon, 1 of
which had detectable CO emission. We derived N(H2) assuming N(HC+)/N(H2) =
3x10^{-9}. %results With the possible exception of 1 weak continuum target HCO+
absorption was detected in all directions, \cch\ in 8 and HCN in 4 directions.
The sightlines divide in 2 groups according to their DNM content with 1 group
of 8 directions having N(DNM) \ga 2x10^{20} \pcc and another group of 5
directions having N(DNM) < .5x10^{20}\pcc. The groups have comparable <N(HI)>
in Chamaeleon 6-7 x 10^{20}\pcc and <N(H)/E(B-V) ~ 6-7x10^{21}\pcc/mag. They
differ in having quite different <E(B-V)> 0.33 vs 0.18 mag, <N(DNM)> 3.3 vs .14

velocities is enriched in molecules and DNM. %conclusion Overall the quantity
of H2 inferred from HCO+ fully accounts for the previously-inferred DNM along
the studied sightlines. H2 is concentrated in the high-DNM group, where the
molecular fraction is 46% vs. 13% otherwise and 38% overall. Thus, neutral gas
in the outskirts of the complex is mostly atomic but the DNM is mostly
molecular. Saturation of the HI emission may occur along 3 of the 4 sightlines
having the largest DNM column densities but there is no substantial reservoir
of 'dark' atomic or molecular gas that remains undetected as part of the
inventory of dark neutral medium.

In some ways they can be regarded as a special case. But for stochastic models
there is a notion of weak distribution or generalised random variable, and the
same arguments can be used to analyse parametric models. Such models in vector
spaces are connected to a linear map, and in infinite dimensional spaces are a
true gener- alisation. Reproducing kernel Hilbert space and affine- / linear-
representations in terms of tensor products are directly related to this linear
operator. This linear map leads to a generalised correlation operator, and
representations are connected with factorisations of the correlation operator.
The fitting counterpart in the stochastic domain to make this point of view as
simple as possible are algebras of random variables with a distinguished linear
functional, the state, which is interpreted as expectation. The connections of
factorisations of the generalised correlation to the spectral decomposition, as
well as the associated Karhunen-Lo\`eve- or proper orthogonal decomposition
will be sketched. The purpose of this short note is to show the common
theoretical background and pull some lose ends together.

consumer preferences for media and entertainment content. Using a unique
filtered dataset of 6,174 movie scripts, we generate a mapping of screen
content to capture the emotional trajectory of each motion picture. We then
combine the obtained mappings into clusters which represent groupings of
consumer emotional journeys. These clusters are used to predict overall success
parameters of the movies including box office revenues, viewer satisfaction
levels (captured by IMDb ratings), awards, as well as the number of viewers'
and critics' reviews. We find that like books all movie stories are dominated
by 6 basic shapes. The highest box offices are associated with the Man in a
Hole shape which is characterized by an emotional fall followed by an emotional
rise. This shape results in financially successful movies irrespective of genre
and production budget. Yet, Man in a Hole succeeds not because it produces most
""liked"" movies but because it generates most ""talked about"" movies.
Interestingly, a carefully chosen combination of production budget and genre
may produce a financially successful movie with any emotional shape.
Implications of this analysis for generating on-demand content and for driving
business model innovation in entertainment industries are discussed.

ensure the string stability of the platoon. Further, the designed controller
also factors the performance of individual vehicles. Hence, when communication
failure occurs, the system will switch to a certain type of CACC instead of
degenerating to adaptive cruise control, which improves the control performance
considerably. The effectiveness of the proposed CACC-DIFT is validated through
numerical experiments based on NGSIM field data. Results indicate that the

and optimal stopping are central to applied probability and financial
engineering. Modern approaches, often relying on ADP, simulation, and/or
duality, have limited rigorous guarantees, which may scale poorly and/or
require previous knowledge of basis functions. A key difficulty with many
approaches is that to yield stronger guarantees, they would necessitate the
computation of deeply nested conditional expectations, with the depth scaling
with the time horizon T.
  We overcome this fundamental obstacle by providing an algorithm which can
trade-off between the guaranteed quality of approximation and the level of
nesting required in a principled manner, without requiring a set of good basis
functions. We develop a novel pure-dual approach, inspired by a connection to
network flows. This leads to a representation for the optimal value as an
infinite sum for which: 1. each term is the expectation of an elegant
recursively defined infimum; 2. the first k terms only require k levels of
nesting; and 3. truncating at the first k terms yields an error of 1/k. This
enables us to devise a simple randomized algorithm whose runtime is effectively
independent of the dimension, beyond the need to simulate sample paths of the
underlying process. Indeed, our algorithm is completely data-driven in that it
only needs the ability to simulate the original process, and requires no prior
knowledge of the underlying distribution. Our method allows one to elegantly
trade-off between accuracy and runtime through a parameter epsilon controlling
the associated performance guarantee, with computational and sample complexity
both polynomial in T (and effectively independent of the dimension) for any
fixed epsilon, in contrast to past methods typically requiring a complexity
scaling exponentially in these parameters.

modulated, as in the phenomenon called electroconvection1, similar to
Rayleigh-B\'enard thermal convection. The question is whether the electric
field can produce spatially localized propagating solitons of molecular
orientation. Here we demonstrate electrically driven three-dimensional
particle-like solitons representing self-trapped waves of oscillating molecular
orientation. The solitons propagate with a very high speed perpendicularly to
both the electric field and the initial alignment direction. The propulsion is
enabled by rapid collective reorientations of the molecules with the frequency
of the applied electric field and by lack of fore-aft symmetry. The solitons
preserve spatially-confined shapes while moving over distances hundreds of
times larger than their size and survive collisions. During collisions, the
solitons show repulsions and attractions, depending on the impact parameter.
The solitons are topologically equivalent to the uniform state and have no
static analogs, thus exhibiting a particle-wave duality. We anticipate the
observations to be a starting point for a broad range of studies since the
system allows for a precise control over a broad range of parameters that
determine the shape, propagation speed, and interactions of the solitons.

components of the particle density, and often provide useful physical insights.
However, given collective coordinates, it is desirable to infer the particle
coordinates via inverse transformations. In principle, a sufficiently large set
of collective coordinates are equivalent to particle coordinates, but the
nonlinear relation between collective and particle coordinates makes the
inversion procedure highly nontrivial. Given a ""target"" configuration in
one-dimensional Euclidean space, we investigate the minimal set of its
collective coordinates that can be uniquely inverted into particle coordinates.
For this purpose, we treat a finite number $M$ of the real and/or the imaginary
parts of collective coordinates of the target configuration as constraints, and
then reconstruct ""solution"" configurations whose collective coordinates satisfy
these constraints. Both theoretical and numerical investigations reveal that
the number of numerically distinct solutions depends sensitively on the chosen
collective-coordinate constraints and target configurations. From detailed
analysis, we conclude that collective coordinates at the
$\lceil\frac{N}{2}\rceil$ smallest wavevectors is the minimal set of
constraints for unique inversion, where $\lceil{\cdot}\rceil$ represents the
ceiling function. This result provides useful groundwork to the inverse
transform of collective coordinates in higher-dimensional systems.

able to efficiently squeeze out the spatial redundancy in video frames. With
preceding pixels as the context, traditional intra prediction schemes generate
linear predictions based on several predefined directions (i.e. modes) for
blocks to be encoded. However, these modes are relatively simple and their
predictions may fail when facing blocks with complex textures, which leads to
additional bits encoding the residue. In this paper, we design a Progressive

and progressively generates predictions by passing information along from
preceding contents to blocks to be encoded. To make our network generate
predictions considering both distortion and bit-rate, we propose to use Sum of
Absolute Transformed Difference (SATD) as the loss function to train PS-RNN
since SATD is able to measure rate-distortion cost of encoding a residue block.
Moreover, our method supports variable-block-size for intra prediction, which
is more practical in real coding conditions. The proposed intra prediction

real-world vehicle traffic traces, we observe that the large-size vehicles,
\emph{e.g.}, trucks, are typically stable with low variations of mobility and
stable channel condition of low signal attenuation; this makes their
inter-connections stable in both connection time and transmission rate.
Secondly, by exploring the stable vehicles, we propose a distributed protocol
to build a multi-hop backbone link for end-to-end transmissions, accordingly
forming a two-tier network architecture in highway vehicular ad hoc networks.

two sides. By integrating monolayer graphene under the dark mode resonators,
the two transmission peaks of the EIT resonance can exhibit independent
amplitude modulation via shifting the Fermi level of the corresponding graphene
layer. The physical mechanism of the modulation can be attributed to the
variation of damping factors of the dark mode resonators arising from the
tunable conductivity of graphene. This work shows great prospects in designing
multiple-spectral THz functional devices with highly flexible tunability and
implies promising applications in multi-channel selective switching, modulation
and slow light.

are acquired via semantic segmentation. Moreover, it is superior to previous

  Analysis under General Service-time Distributions","12 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.DC cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In cloud storage systems with a large number of servers, files are typically
not stored in single servers. Instead, they are split, replicated (to ensure
reliability in case of server malfunction) and stored in different servers. We
analyze the mean latency of such a split-and-replicate cloud storage system
under general sub-exponential service time. We present a novel scheduling
scheme that utilizes the load-balancing policy of the \textit{power of $d$
$(\geq 2)$} choices. An alternative to split-and-replicate is to use
erasure-codes, and recently, it has been observed that they can reduce latency
in data access (see \cite{longbo_delay} for details). We argue that under high
redundancy (integer redundancy factor strictly greater than or equal to 2)
regime, the mean latency of a coded system is upper bounded by that of a
split-and-replicate system (with same replication factor) and the gap between
these two is small. We validate this claim numerically under different service
distributions such as exponential, shift plus exponential and the heavy-tailed
Weibull distribution and compare the mean latency to that of an
unsplit-replicated system. We observe that the coded system outperforms the
unsplit-replication system by at least $20\%$. Furthermore, we consider the
mean latency for an erasure coded system with low redundancy (fractional
redundancy factor between 1 and 2), a scenario which is more pragmatic, given
the storage constraints (\cite{rashmi_thesis}). However under this regime, we
restrict ourselves to the special case of exponential service time distribution
and use the randomized load balancing policy namely \textit{batch-sampling}. We
obtain an upper bound on mean delay that depends on the order statistics of the
queue lengths, which, we further smooth out via a discrete to continuous
approximation.

features or use them inefficiently, and such a practice may lead an undergoing
software project to a fragile, insecure and non-robust application system. In
this paper, we propose a context-aware code recommendation approach that
recommends exception handling code examples from a number of popular open
source code repositories hosted at GitHub. It collects the code examples
exploiting GitHub code search API, and then analyzes, filters and ranks them
against the code under development in the IDE by leveraging not only the
structural (i.e., graph-based) and lexical features but also the heuristic
quality measures of exception handlers in the examples. Experiments with 4,400
code examples and 65 exception handling scenarios as well as comparisons with
four existing approaches show that the proposed approach is highly promising.

data collections, where individual data sets from different domains are linked
and integrated to allow advanced analytics. A popular type of data used in such
a context are historical censuses, as well as birth, death, and marriage
certificates. Individually, such data sets however limit the types of studies
that can be conducted. Specifically, it is impossible to track individuals,
families, or households over time. Once such data sets are linked and family
trees spanning several decades are available it is possible to, for example,
investigate how education, health, mobility, employment, and social status
influence each other and the lives of people over two or even more generations.
A major challenge is however the accurate linkage of historical data sets which
is due to data quality and commonly also the lack of ground truth data being
available. Unsupervised techniques need to be employed, which can be based on
similarity graphs generated by comparing individual records. In this paper we
present initial results from clustering birth records from Scotland where we
aim to identify all births of the same mother and group siblings into clusters.
We extend an existing clustering technique for record linkage by incorporating
temporal constraints that must hold between births by the same mother, and
propose a novel greedy temporal clustering technique. Experimental results show
improvements over non-temporary approaches, however further work is needed to
obtain links of high quality.

We derive a bias-free, input-dependent baseline to reduce this variance, and
analytically show its benefits over state-dependent baselines. We then propose
a meta-learning approach to overcome the complexity of learning a baseline that
depends on a long sequence of inputs. Our experimental results show that across
environments from queuing systems, computer networks, and MuJoCo robotic
locomotion, input-dependent baselines consistently improve training stability

to design a two-dimensional ferroelectric tunnel junction composed of
homostructural $p$-type semiconductor/ferroelectric/$n$-type semiconductor.
Since the in-plane polarization persists in the monolayer ferroelectric

In:SnSe/SnSe/Sb:SnSe and reveal a giant TER effect of 1460$\%$. The dynamical
modulation of both barrier width and barrier height during the ferroelectric
switching are responsible for this giant TER effect. These findings provide an
important insight towards the understanding of the quantum behaviors of

  Cyber-Physical Software",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cyber-physical software continually interacts with its physical environment
for adaptation in order to deliver smart services. However, the interactions
can be subject to various errors when the software's assumption on its
environment no longer holds, thus leading to unexpected misbehavior or even
failure. To address this problem, one promising way is to conduct runtime
monitoring of invariants, so as to prevent cyber-physical software from
entering such errors (a.k.a. abnormal states). To effectively detect abnormal
states, we in this article present an approach, named Context-based
Multi-Invariant Detection (CoMID), which consists of two techniques:
context-based trace grouping and multi-invariant detection. The former infers
contexts to distinguish different effective scopes for CoMID's derived
invariants, and the latter conducts ensemble evaluation of multiple invariants
to detect abnormal states. We experimentally evaluate CoMID on real-world
cyber-physical software. The results show that CoMID achieves a 5.7-28.2%
higher true-positive rate and a 6.8-37.6% lower false-positive rate in
detecting abnormal states, as compared with state-of-the-art approaches (i.e.,
Daikon and ZoomIn). When deployed in field tests, CoMID's runtime monitoring
improves the success rate of cyber-physical software in its task executions by
15.3-31.7%.

propose to employ the non-orthogonal central-moment-relaxation model, where we
develop a novel adaptive relaxation method to retain both stability and

continuous-scale formulation that enables samples at arbitrary resolutions to
easily communicate with each other in a more continuous sense and with loose
geometrical constraints, which allows efficient and adaptive sample
construction to better match the physical scale. Such a capability directly
leads to an automatic sample construction which generates static and dynamic
scales at initialization and during simulation, respectively. This effectively
makes our method suitable for simulating turbulent flows with arbitrary
geometrical boundaries. Our simulation results with applications to smoke

analysis. The change in the electronic structure of the molecule after the
attachment of a low-energy ($\leq$ 15 eV) electron, thus forming a transient
negative ion, can be interpreted from the $n\rightarrow\sigma^*$ and
$n\rightarrow\pi^*$ interactions. The results of the calculations are used to
interpret the dissociative electron attachment process. The dissociation of the
anion SO$_2^-$ into negative and neutral fragments has been explained by
interpreting the infrared spectrum and different vibration modes. It could be
observed that the dissociation of SO_{2}^{-} into S^{-} occurs as a result of
simultaneous symmetric stretching and bending modes of the molecular anion.
While the formation of O$^-$ and SO$^-$ occurs as a result of anti-symmetric
stretching of the molecular anion. The calculated symmetries of the TNI state
contributing to the first resonant peak at around 5.2 eV and second resonant
peak at around 7.5 eV was observed from time-dependent density functional

as a fertile quantitative approach to systematically understand the urban
phenomena. One of its main pillars is the proposition that urban systems
display universal scaling behavior regarding socioeconomic, infrastructural and
individual basic services variables. This paper discusses the extension of the
universality proposition by testing it against a broad range of urban metrics
in a developing country urban system. We present an exploration of the scaling
exponents for over 6$ variables for the Brazilian urban system. As Brazilian
municipalities can deviate significantly from urban settlements, urban-like
municipalities were selected based on a systematic density cut-off procedure
and the scaling exponents were estimated for this new subset of municipalities.
To validate our findings we compared the results for overlaying variables with
other studies based on alternative methods. It was found that the analyzed
socioeconomic variables follow a superlinear scaling relationship with the
population size, and most of the infrastructure and individual basic services
variables follow expected sublinear and linear scaling, respectively. However,
some infrastructural and individual basic services variables deviated from
their expected regimes, challenging the universality hypothesis of urban
scaling. We propose that these deviations are a product of top-down
decisions/policies. Our analysis spreads over a time-range of 10 years, what is
not enough to draw conclusive observations, nevertheless we found hints that
the scaling exponent of these variables are evolving towards the expected
scaling regime, indicating that the deviations might be temporally constrained
and that the urban systems might eventually reach the expected scaling regime.

maximize its own utility with respect to the relevance estimation of documents
produced by the other player, a retrieval modeler; simultaneously, the
retrieval modeler, taking actions to produce the document relevance scores,
needs to optimize its likelihood from the training data with respect to the
refined query produced by the query formulator. Their equilibrium or equilibria
will be reached when both are the best responses to each other. We derive our

share the same objective function and thus form a partnership game; by
contrast, pseudo relevance feedback pursues a rather different objective than

analogy with the word ""big-data"", we refer to this challenge as ""micro-data

knowledge on the policy structure (e.g., dynamic movement primitives), on the
policy parameters (e.g., demonstrations), or on the dynamics (e.g.,
simulators). A second strategy is to create data-driven surrogate models of the
expected reward (e.g., Bayesian optimization) or the dynamical model (e.g.,
model-based policy search), so that the policy optimizer queries the model
instead of the real system. Overall, all successful micro-data algorithms
combine these two strategies by varying the kind of model and prior knowledge.
The current scientific challenges essentially revolve around scaling up to
complex robots (e.g., humanoids), designing generic priors, and optimizing the

(GCs) with multiple stellar populations is that an initial massive stellar
system forms (`first generation', FG), subsequently giving rise to gaseous
ejecta which is converted into a second generation (SG) of stars to form a GC.
We investigate, for the first time, the sequential formation processes of both
FG and SG stars from star-forming massive gas clumps in gas-rich dwarf disk
galaxies. We adopt a novel approach to resolve the two-stage formation of GCs
in hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies.In the new simulations, new gas
particles that are much less massive than their parent star particle are
generated around each new star particle when the new star enters into the
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Furthermore, much finer maximum time step
width (<10^5 yr) and smaller softening length (<2 pc) are adopted for such AGB
gas particles to properly resolve the ejection of gas from AGB stars and AGB
feedback effects. Therefore, secondary star formation from AGB ejecta can be
properly investigated in galaxy-scale simulations. An FG stellar system can
first form from a massive gas clump developing due to gravitational instability
within its host gas-rich dwarf galaxy. Initially the FG stellar system is not a
single massive cluster, but instead is composed of several irregular stellar
clumps (or filaments) with a total mass larger than 10^6 Msun. While the FG
system is dynamically relaxing, gaseous ejecta from AGB stars can be
gravitationally trapped by the FG system and subsequently converted into new
stars to form a compact SG stellar system within the FG system. Interestingly,
about 40% of AGB ejecta is from stars that do not belong to the FG system
(`external gas accretion'). The mass-density relation for SG stellar systems
can be approximated as rho_SG ~ M_SG^1.5.

domain describing an incompressible base flow. The perturbation equation can be
vectorized and written as an ordinary differential equation where the
coefficients are circulant matrices. The diagonalization of the system is
equivalent to apply a spatial discrete Fourier transform. This leads to
stability conditions expressed by the discrete Fourier transform of the first
and second derivatives of the kernel. Although spurious modes are highlighted,
no tensile nor pairing instabilities are found in the present study, suggesting
that the perturbations of the stresses are always damped if the base flow is
incompressible. The perturbations equation is solved in the Laplace domain,
allowing to derive an analytical solution of the transient state. Also, it is
demonstrated analytically that a positive background pressure combined with the
uncorrected gradient operator leads to a reordering of the particle lattice. It
is also shown that above a critical value, the background pressure leads to
instabilities. Finally, the dispersion curves for inviscid and viscous flows
are plotted for different WCSPH methods and compared to the continuum solution.
It is observed that a background pressure equal to $\rho c^2$ gives the best
fidelity to predict the propagation of a sound wave. When viscosity effects are
taken into account, the damping of pressure fluctuations show the best
agreement with the continuum for $p_{back} \sim \rho c^2/2$.

weight clipping to accelerate and stabilize training; (2) systematic
exploration to discover high-reward trajectories; (3) distributed sampling from
inside and outside of the memory buffer to scale up training. MAPO improves the
sample efficiency and robustness of policy gradient, especially on tasks with
sparse rewards. We evaluate MAPO on weakly supervised program synthesis from
natural language (semantic parsing). On the WikiTableQuestions benchmark, we
improve the state-of-the-art by 2.6%, achieving an accuracy of 46.3%. On the
WikiSQL benchmark, MAPO achieves an accuracy of 74.9% with only weak
supervision, outperforming several strong baselines with full supervision. Our

challenging task. There are several fusion architectures in the literature,
e.g. the sensor data can be fused right at the beginning (Early Fusion), or
they can be first processed separately and then concatenated later (Late
Fusion). In this work, different fusion architectures are compared and
evaluated by means of object detection tasks, in which the goal is to recognize
and localize predefined objects in a stream of data. Usually, state-of-the-art
object detectors based on neural networks are highly optimized for good weather
conditions, since the well-known benchmarks only consist of sensor data
recorded in optimal weather conditions. Therefore, the performance of these
approaches decreases enormously or even fails in adverse weather conditions. In
this work, different sensor fusion architectures are compared for good and
adverse weather conditions for finding the optimal fusion architecture for
diverse weather situations. A new training strategy is also introduced such
that the performance of the object detector is greatly enhanced in adverse
weather scenarios or if a sensor fails. Furthermore, the paper responds to the
question if the detection accuracy can be increased further by providing the
neural network with a-priori knowledge such as the spatial calibration of the
sensors.

efficient exact inference. Furthermore, the use of higher-order factors allows
us to capture relations of multiple input segments and multiple output labels

commonly used first-order models and higher-order models with local factors

this paper, we show that an unconventional anomalous Hall effect (AHE) can

influences antiferromagnetic domain switching. Our epitaxial Nd2Ir2O7 thin film
showed a large enhancement of the AHE signal when the AFM domains switched,
indicating that the AHE is mainly due to DWs. Our study highlights the symmetry
broken interface of AFM materials as a new means of exploring topological

explain how the result for an arbitrary Seifert geometry can be obtained by

changing the topology of the Seifert fibration. We also point out that most

device based on topologically frustrated spin-ice nanomagnets. The device is
made of a magnetic Co honeycomb array embedded in a superconducting Nb film.
This device is based on three simple mechanisms: i) the topology of the Co
honeycomb array frustrates in-plane magnetic configurations in the array
yielding a distribution of magnetic charges which can be ordered or disordered
with in-plane magnetic fields, following spin-ice rules, ii) the local vertex
magnetization, which consists of a magnetic half vortex with two charged
magnetic N\'eel walls, iii) the interaction between superconducting vortices
and the asymmetric potentials provided by the N\'eel walls. The combination of
these elements leads to a superconducting ratchet effect. Thus, superconducting
vortices driven by alternating forces and moving on magnetic half vortices
generate a unidirectional net vortex flow. This ratchet effect is independent
of the distribution of magnetic charges in the array.

advantages compared with the traditional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).
However, an NMT system still often produces translation failures due to the
complexity of natural language and sophistication in designing neural networks.
While in-house black-box system testing based on reference translations (i.e.,
examples of valid translations) has been a common practice for NMT quality
assurance, an increasingly critical industrial practice, named in-vivo testing,
exposes unseen types or instances of translation failures when real users are
using a deployed industrial NMT system. To fill the gap of lacking test oracle
for in-vivo testing of an NMT system, in this paper, we propose a new approach
for automatically identifying translation failures, without requiring reference

oracle for in-vivo testing. Our approach focuses on properties of natural
language translation that can be checked systematically and uses information
from both the test inputs (i.e., the texts to be translated) and the test
outputs (i.e., the translations under inspection) of the NMT system. Our
evaluation conducted on real-world datasets shows that our approach can
effectively detect targeted property violations as translation failures. Our

investigate a ring resonator (e.g. a fiber loop resonator or whispering gallery

of temporal symmetry breaking (in which pulses in the resonator either run

the resonator spontaneously generates elliptically polarized light out of
linearly polarized seed pulses). We find ranges of pump parameters for which

needed and have already been presented. Therefore, the aim of the study was to
assess the accuracies in determining causal paths in a dataset without
considering the ground truth and the contextual information. This benchmark was
performed on the database with cause-effect pairs, using a framework consisting
of generalized correlations (GC), kernel regression gradients (GR) and absolute
residuals criteria (AR), along with causal additive modeling (CAM). The best
overall accuracy, 80%, was achieved for the (majority voting) combination of
GC, AR, and CAM, however, the most similar sensitivity and specificity values
were obtained for AR. Bootstrap simulation established the probability of
correct causal path determination (which pairs should remain indeterminate).
The mean accuracy was then improved to 83% for the selected subset of pairs.
The described approach can be used for preliminary dependence assessment, as an
initial step for commonly used causality assessment frameworks or for

neutrinos may potentially be employed as stellar gyroscopes, if phases of

emission prior to the onset of the SN explosion. This is shown by comparing the
neutrino emission properties of self-consistent, three-dimensional (3D) SN
simulations of a 15 M_sun progenitor without rotation as well as slow and fast
rotation compatible with observational constraints. The explosion of the fast
rotating model gives rise to long-lasting, massive polar accretion downflows
with stochastic time-variability, detectable e.g. by the IceCube Neutrino
Observatory for any observer direction. While spectrograms of the neutrino
event rate of non-rotating SNe feature a well-known sharp peak due to SASI for
observers located in the proximity of the SASI plane, the corresponding
spectrograms of rotating models show activity over a wide range of frequencies,
most notably above 200 Hz for rapid rotation. In addition, the Fourier power
spectra of the event rate for rotating models exhibit a SASI peak with lower
power than in non-rotating models. The spectra for the rotating models also
show secondary peaks at higher frequencies with greater relative heights

imprints will be detectable for SNe at 10 kpc or closer.

photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) of materials with glide-mirror symmetry,
focusing on the role of glide symmetry on the spin selection rule. In the
glide-symmetric SARPES configuration, where the surface of a material, the
incoming light and the outgoing photoelectrons are invariant under a glide
reflection, the spin polarization of photoelectrons is determined by the glide
eigenvalue of the initial state, which makes SARPES a powerful tool for
studying topological phases protected by glide symmetry. We also show that, due
to the nonsymmorphic character of glide symmetry, the spin polarization of a
photoelectron whose momentum is in the second surface Brillouin zone is the
opposite of the spin polarization of a photoelectron which is ejected from the
same initial Bloch state but whose momentum is in the first zone. This momentum
dependence of spin selection rule clearly distinguishes glide symmetry from
mirror symmetry and is particularly important if the Bloch wavevector of the
initial state is close to the first surface Brillouin zone boundary. As a proof
of principle, we simulate the SARPES from the surface states of KHgSb (010) and
investigate how the spin selection rule imposed by the glide symmetry manifests
itself in a real material.

In this paper, we use a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to produce

our approach is that we first back project each view separately to form a stack
of back projections and then feed this stack as input into the convolutional

leveraged by the spatial invariance of the CNN to learn the reconstruction

magnetic field concentrations at the solar surface.
  It is well established that this relation between chromospheric emission and
magnetic field is nonlinear. Here we investigate systematically how this
relation, characterised by the exponent of a power-law fit, changes through the
atmosphere, from the upper photosphere through the temperature minimum region
and chromosphere to the transition region.
  We used spectral maps from IRIS: MgII and its wings, CII, and SiIV together
with magnetograms and UV continuum images from SDO. We performed a power-law
fit for the relation between each pair of observables and determine the
power-law index (or exponent) for these.
  While the correlation between emission and magnetic field drops monotonically
with temperature, the power-law index shows a hockey-stick-type variation: from
the upper photosphere to the temperature-minimum it drops sharply and then
increases through the chromosphere into the transition region. This is even
seen through the features of the MgII line, this is, from k1 to k2 and k3. It
is irrespective of spatial resolution or feature types on the Sun.
  In accordance with the general picture of flux-flux relations from the
chromosphere to the corona, above the temperature minimum the sensitivity of
the emission to the plasma heating increases with temperature. Below the
temperature minimum a different mechanism has to govern the opposite trend of
the power-law index with temperature. We suggest four possibilities, in other
words, a geometric effect of expanding flux tubes filling the available
chromospheric volume, the height of formation of the emitted radiation, the
dependence on wavelength of the intensity-temperature relationship, and the
dependence of the heating of flux tubes on the magnetic flux density.

  Decision Processes",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While designing the state space of an MDP, it is common to include states
that are transient or not reachable by any policy (e.g., in mountain car, the
product space of speed and position contains configurations that are not
physically reachable). This leads to defining weakly-communicating or
multi-chain MDPs. In this paper, we introduce \tucrl, the first algorithm able
to perform efficient exploration-exploitation in any finite Markov Decision
Process (MDP) without requiring any form of prior knowledge. In particular, for
any MDP with $S^{\texttt{C}}$ communicating states, $A$ actions and
$\Gamma^{\texttt{C}} \leq S^{\texttt{C}}$ possible communicating next states,
we derive a $\widetilde{O}(D^{\texttt{C}} \sqrt{\Gamma^{\texttt{C}}

(i.e., the longest shortest path) of the communicating part of the MDP. This is
in contrast with optimistic algorithms (e.g., UCRL, Optimistic PSRL) that
suffer linear regret in weakly-communicating MDPs, as well as posterior
sampling or regularised algorithms (e.g., REGAL), which require prior knowledge
on the bias span of the optimal policy to bias the exploration to achieve
sub-linear regret. We also prove that in weakly-communicating MDPs, no
algorithm can ever achieve a logarithmic growth of the regret without first
suffering a linear regret for a number of steps that is exponential in the
parameters of the MDP. Finally, we report numerical simulations supporting our
theoretical findings and showing how TUCRL overcomes the limitations of the
state-of-the-art.

observations with the RoboPol, KANATA, Perkins and Steward polarimeters. In the
cases where evidences for long rotations of the polarisation plane are found,
we carry out numerical simulations to assess the probability that they are
caused by intrinsically evolving EVPAs instead of observational noise. Even our
moderately sampled sources show indications of variability, both in
polarisation fraction and angle. For the four best sampled objects in our
sample we find multiple periods of significant polarisation angle variability.
In the two best sampled cases, namely J1505+0326 and J0324+3410, we find
indications for three long rotations. We show that although noise can induce
the observed behaviour, it is much more likely that the apparent rotation is
caused by intrinsic evolution of the EVPA. To our knowledge this is the very
first detection of such events in this class of sources. In the case of the
largest dataset (J0324+3410) we find that the EVPA concentrates around a

orthogonal nature to novelty this paper investigates the impact of the former
to quality diversity performance. For that purpose we introduce three new

selected spin state is allowed to retain large localization lengths. An
analysis is carried out to understand the roles played by the spin projections

  Their metric tensors possess a simple, closed-form analytical expression. The
approximations capture to leading order the oblateness of the planet, the
widening of atmospheric columns with height, the horizontal and vertical
variations of gravity and the non-traditional part of the Coriolis force.
Furthermore, for the first two approximations, the horizontal metric is
conformal (proportional) to the spherical metric, which simplifies analytical
and numerical formulations of the equations of motion.

of cell biology and is often modeled with the paradigmatic asymmetric simple
exclusion process. Motivated by recent experimental studies that have addressed
the stepping behavior of kinesins on microtubules, we investigate a lattice gas
model for simultaneous transport of two species of active particles on a
cylinder. The species are distinguished by their different gaits: While the
first species moves straight ahead, the second follows a helical path. We show
that the collective properties of such systems critically differ from those of
one-species transport in a way that cannot be accounted for by standard models.
This is most evident in a jamming transition far below full occupation, as well
as in non-equilibrium pattern formation. The altered behavior arises because -
unlike the case in single-species transport - any given position may be
targeted by two particles from different directions at the same time. However,
a particle can leave a given position only in one direction. This simple change
in connectivity significantly amplifies the impact of steric interactions and
thus becomes a key determinant of mixed species transport. We computationally
characterize this type of hindrance and develop a comprehensive theory for
collective two-species transport along a cylinder. Our observations show high
robustness against model extensions that account for additional biomolecular
features and demonstrate that even small fractions of a second species can
significantly alter transport. This suggests that our analysis is also relevant
in a biological context.

is often neglected or regarded as less important than the effect of the

the instabilities. The paper presents experimental results collected from a
combustor featuring a lean swirl-stabilized flame exhibiting thermoacoustic
instability at some operating conditions. It is shown that this instability is
caused by a change of the flame topology that is induced by the progressive
increase of the wall temperature with the thermal power. This dependence of the
instability on wall temperature leads to inertial effects and hysteresis when
the operating condition is changed dynamically. A low-order model of the system
reproducing this remarkable dynamics is proposed and validated against the
experimental data.

linear electron-positron collider operating at three energy stages, with
nominal centre-of-mass energies: 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV, and 3 TeV. Its aim is to
explore the energy frontier, providing sensitivity to physics beyond the
Standard Model (BSM) and precision measurements of Standard Model processes
with an emphasis on Higgs boson and top-quark physics. The opportunities for
top-quark physics at CLIC are discussed in this paper. The initial stage of
operation focuses on top-quark pair production measurements, as well as the
search for rare flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) top-quark decays. It
also includes a top-quark pair production threshold scan around 350 GeV which
provides a precise measurement of the top-quark mass in a well-defined
theoretical framework. At the higher-energy stages, studies are made of
top-quark pairs produced in association with other particles. A study of ttH
production including the extraction of the top Yukawa coupling is presented as
well as a study of vector boson fusion (VBF) production, which gives direct
access to high-energy electroweak interactions. Operation above 1 TeV leads to
more highly collimated jet environments where dedicated methods are used to
analyse the jet constituents. These techniques enable studies of the top-quark
pair production, and hence the sensitivity to BSM physics, to be extended to
higher energies. This paper also includes phenomenological interpretations that
may be performed using the results from the extensive top-quark physics
programme at CLIC.

simultaneously and leverages the shared information between related tasks to
improve the generalization performance. However, missing features in the input
matrix is a much more difficult problem which needs to be carefully addressed.
Removing records with missing values can significantly reduce the sample size,
which is impractical for datasets with large percentage of missing values.
Popular imputation methods often distort the covariance structure of the data,
which causes inaccurate inference. In this paper we propose using plug-in
covariance matrix estimators to tackle the challenge of missing features.
Specifically, we analyze the plug-in estimators under the framework of robust
multi-task learning with LASSO and graph regularization, which captures the
relatedness between tasks via graph regularization. We use the Alzheimer's
disease progression dataset as an example to show how the proposed framework is
effective for prediction and model estimation when missing data is present.

models by themselves cannot predict when or where a forced oscillation will
occur. Locating the sources of these oscillations, therefore, is a challenging
problem which requires analytical methods capable of using real time power
system data to trace an observed oscillation back to its source. The difficulty
of this problem is exacerbated by the fact that the parameters associated with
a given power system model can range from slightly uncertain to entirely
unknown. In this paper, a Bayesian framework, via a two-stage Maximum A
Posteriori optimization routine, is employed in order to locate the most
probable source of a forced oscillation given an uncertain prior model. The
approach leverages an equivalent circuit representation of the system in the
frequency domain and employs a numerical procedure which makes the problem
suitable for real time application. The derived framework lends itself to
successful performance in the presence of PMU measurement noise, high generator
parameter uncertainty, and multiple forced oscillations occurring
simultaneously. The approach is tested on a 4-bus system with a single forced
oscillation source and on the WECC 179-bus system with multiple oscillation

degree polynomial in $Z$ with two free parameters - and a fourth degree
polynomial in ${\lambda}$ (a generalization of the Majorana formula) reproduce
the ground state energy of the helium-like and lithium-like ions for $Z \leq
20$ in the domain of applicability of NRQED, thus, at least, 3 s.d. It is noted
that $\gtrsim 99.9\%$ of the ground state energy is given by the variational
energy for properly optimized trial function of the form of (anti)-symmetrized
product of three (six) screened Coulomb orbitals for two-(three) electron
system with 3 (7) free parameters for $Z \leq 20$, respectively. It may imply
that these trial functions are, in fact, {\it exact} wavefunctions in
non-relativistic QED, thus, the NRQED effective potential can be derived. It is
shown that the sum of relativistic and QED effects in leading approximation - 3
s.d. - for both 2 and 3 electron systems is interpolated by 4th degree

Standard sources of advisories and vulnerability data, such as the National

inconsistent quality.
  To reduce our dependency on these sources, we propose an approach that uses
machine-learning to analyze source code repositories and to automatically
identify commits that are security-relevant (i.e., that are likely to fix a
vulnerability). We treat the source code changes introduced by commits as
documents written in natural language, classifying them using standard document
classification methods.
  Combining independent classifiers that use information from different facets
of commits, our method can yield high precision (80%) while ensuring acceptable
recall (43%). In particular, the use of information extracted from the source
code changes yields a substantial improvement over the best known approach in
state of the art, while requiring a significantly smaller amount of training
data and employing a simpler architecture.

Io, Europa, and Ganymede, which is commonly known as the Laplace resonance. In
particular, we construct approximate models for the evolution of the librating
argument over the period of 100 years, focusing on its principal amplitude and
frequency, and on the observed mean motion combinations associated with the
quasi-resonant interactions. First, we numerically propagated the Cartesian
equations of motion of the Jovian system for the period under examination, and
by comparing the results with a suitable set of ephemerides, we derived the
main dynamical effects on the target quantities. Using these effects, we built
an alternative Hamiltonian formulation and used the normal forms theory to
locate the resonance and to compute its main amplitude and frequency. From the
Cartesian model we observe that on the timescale considered and with
ephemerides as initial conditions, both the librating argument and the
diagnostics are well approximated by considering the mutual gravitational
interactions of Jupiter and the Galilean moons (including Callisto), and the
effect of Jupiter's J2 harmonic. Under the same initial conditions, the
Hamiltonian formulation in which Callisto and J2 are reduced to their secular
contributions achieves larger errors for the quantities above, particularly for
the librating argument. By introducing appropriate resonant variables, we show
that these errors can be reduced by moving in a certain action-angle phase
plane, which in turn implies the necessity of a tradeoff in the selection of
the initial conditions. In addition to being a good starting point for a deeper
understanding of the Laplace resonance, the models and methods described are
easily generalizable to different types of multi-body mean motion resonances.

neural network (DNN). The performance achieved by the proposed algorithm is
very close to the optimal maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) over a wide range
of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while the computational complexity, compared
to existing sphere decoding variants, is significantly reduced. This
improvement is attributed to DNN's ability of intelligently learning the radius
of the hypersphere used in decoding. The expected complexity of the proposed
DL-based algorithm is analytically derived and compared with existing ones. It
is shown that the number of lattice points inside the decoding hypersphere
drastically reduces in the DL- based algorithm in both the average and
worst-case senses. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is shown through
simulation for high-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems,
using high-order modulations.

gravitons from a lasing medium. For significant amplification, we must have a
very long path length and/or very high densities. Black holes and the existence
of weakly interacting sub-eV dark matter particles (WISPs) solve both of these
obstacles. Orbiting trajectories for massless particles around black holes are
well understood \cite{mtw} and allow for arbitrarily long graviton path
lengths. Superradiance from Kerr black holes of WISPs can provide the
sufficiently high density \cite{ABH}. This suggests that black holes can act as
efficient graviton lasers. Thus directed graviton laser beams have been emitted
since the beginning of the universe and give rise to new sources of
gravitational wave signals. To be in the path of particularly harmfully
amplified graviton death rays will not be pleasant.

Applying larger DNNs to more diverse applications is an important challenge.
The computations performed during DNN training and inference are dominated by
operations on the weight matrices describing the DNN. As DNNs incorporate more
layers and more neurons per layers, these weight matrices may be required to be
sparse because of memory limitations. Sparse DNNs are one possible approach,
but the underlying theory is in the early stages of development and presents a
number of challenges, including determining the accuracy of inference and
selecting nonzero weights for training. Associative array algebra has been
developed by the big data community to combine and extend database, matrix, and
graph/network concepts for use in large, sparse data problems. Applying this
mathematics to DNNs simplifies the formulation of DNN mathematics and reveals
that DNNs are linear over oscillating semirings. This work uses associative
array DNNs to construct exact solutions and corresponding perturbation models
to the rectified linear unit (ReLU) DNN equations that can be used to construct
test vectors for sparse DNN implementations over various precisions. These
solutions can be used for DNN verification, theoretical explorations of DNN
properties, and a starting point for the challenge of sparse training.

attraction of electron and anti-electron, modified by small spin-spin and
radiative QED corrections, the proper ground state is caused by the magnetic
attraction between electron and anti-electron, which dominates over the
electric one at short distances. This finding suggests that the familiar

transition between two atomic energy levels, with the energy difference
radiated off in form of photons --- except that the energy difference is huge:
about 1 MeV instead of the few eV in a hydrogenic transition. In their proper
ground state configuration the two particles would be so close that they would
electromagnetically neutralize each other for most practical purposes, thus
giving the appearance of an annihilation. Once in such a tightly bound state
such pairs would hardly interact with normal matter and not be noticeable ---

with spatially varying coefficients. Even for very simple systems, these models
require numerical solutions which are computationally expensive and do not
provide the valuable insights associated with closed-form solutions. We will
show that fractional calculus can provide a powerful approach to develop
comprehensive mathematical models of inhomogeneous systems that can effectively
be regarded as homogenized models. Although at first glance the mathematics
might appear more complex, these fractional order models can allow the
derivation of closed-form analytical solutions that provide excellent
estimations of the systems' dynamic responses. Equally important, these
solutions are valid in a frequency range that goes largely beyond the
well-known homogenization limit of traditional integer order approaches,
therefore providing a possible route to high-frequency homogenization. More
specifically, this study focuses on the analyses of the dispersion and
propagation properties of a periodic medium under single-tone harmonic
excitation and illustrates the methodology to obtain a space-fractional wave
equation capable of capturing the behavior of the physical system. The
fractional wave equation and its analytical solution are compared with
numerical results obtained via a traditional finite element method in order to
assess their validity and evaluate their performance. It is found that the
resulting fractional differential models are, in their most general form, of
complex and frequency-dependent order.
