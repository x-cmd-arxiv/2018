representation learning on regular grid data such as image and video. Recently,
increasing attention has been paid on generalizing CNNs to graph or network
data which is highly irregular. Some focus on graph-level representation
learning while others aim to learn node-level representations. These methods
have been shown to boost the performance of many graph-level tasks such as
graph classification and node-level tasks such as node classification. Most of
these methods have been designed for single-dimensional graphs where a pair of
nodes can only be connected by one type of relation. However, many real-world
graphs have multiple types of relations and they can be naturally modeled as
multi-dimensional graphs with each type of relation as a dimension.
Multi-dimensional graphs bring about richer interactions between dimensions,
which poses tremendous challenges to the graph convolutional neural networks
designed for single-dimensional graphs. In this paper, we study the problem of
graph convolutional networks for multi-dimensional graphs and propose a
multi-dimensional convolutional neural network model mGCN aiming to capture
rich information in learning node-level representations for multi-dimensional

Therefore identifying co-evolution of genes can predict functional gene-gene

strategies underlying the original algorithm, CLustering by Inferred Models of
Evolution (CLIME 1.0) recently reported by us [Li et al., 2014]. CLIME 1.0
employs a mixture of tree-structured hidden Markov models for gene evolution
process, and a Bayesian model-based clustering algorithm to detect gene modules
with shared evolutionary histories (termed evolutionary conserved modules, or
ECMs). A Dirichlet process prior was adopted for estimating the number of gene
clusters and a Gibbs sampler was developed for posterior sampling. We further
developed an extended version, CLIME 1.1, to incorporate the uncertainty on the
evolutionary tree structure. By simulation studies and benchmarks on real data
sets, we show that CLIME 1.0 and CLIME 1.1 outperform traditional methods that
use simple metrics (e.g., the Hamming distance or Pearson correlation) to
measure co-evolution between pairs of genes.

supported by fog and cloud. We optimize the placement of the IoT services in
this architecture so that the total power consumption is minimized. Our results
show that, introducing local computation at the IoT layer can bring up to 90%
power savings compared with general purpose servers in a central cloud.

simulator allows user-controlled tailoring of native interactions to achieve a
target Hamiltonian. The flexibility of engineering long-ranged phonon-mediated
spin-spin interactions in a trapped ion quantum simulator offers such a
possibility. Trapped ions, a leading candidate for simulating computationally
hard quantum many-body dynamics, are most readily trapped in a linear 1D chain,
limiting their utility for readily simulating higher dimensional spin models.
In this work, we introduce a hybrid method of analog-digital simulation for
simulating 2D spin models and dynamically changing interactions to achieve a
new graph using a linear 1D chain. The method relies on time domain Hamiltonian
engineering through a successive application of Stark shift gradient pulses,
and wherein the pulse sequence can simply be obtained from a Fourier series
decomposition of the target Hamiltonian over the space of lattice couplings. We
focus on engineering 2D rectangular nearest-neighbor spin lattices,
demonstrating that the required control parameters scale linearly with ion
number. This hybrid approach offers compelling possibilities for the use of 1D
chains in the study of Hamiltonian quenches, dynamical phase transitions, and
quantum transport in 2D and 3D. We discuss a possible experimental
implementation of this approach using real experimental parameters.

control the vortex structure of the cavity on the suction side and wake region
of the CAV2003 benchmark hydrofoil. This method may be used in different
applications such as marine, turbomachinery and hydraulic machinery. First, we
used a hybrid URANS model for turbulence to simulate the 3D unsteady cloud
cavitating flow and validated it based on experimental data. We performed the
numerical simulations using open source code OpenFOAM and an Euler-Euler
cavitation model. Second, we studied the effect of passive boundary layer
control method on vortex structure on the suction side of the hydrofoil and in
wake region. We showed that this control method may influence the boundary
layer structure on the hydrofoil surface and also near the trailing edge. Using
this technique the pressure distribution and the fluctuating part of the
velocity field on the hydrofoil surface were modified over the chord length.
This method induced a stabilization of the boundary layer and delay its
separation. Therefore a significant reduction in cavitation-induced vibration
may be expected.

instead of weighted averaging, to interpolate between signal measurements. This
smooths the data, but without blurring the data beyond instrumental resolution.
Techniques that rely on weighted averaging blur point sources sometimes as much
as 40%. (2) Our algorithm makes use of local, instead of global, modeling to
separate astronomical signal from instrumental and/or environmental signal
drift along the telescope's scans. Other techniques, such as basket weaving,
model this drift with simple functional forms (linear, quadratic, etc.) across
the entirety of scans, limiting their ability to remove such contaminants. (3)
Our algorithm makes use of a similar, local modeling technique to separate
astronomical signal from radio-frequency interference (RFI), even if only
continuum data are available. (4) Unlike other techniques, our algorithm does
not require data to be collected on a rectangular grid or regridded before
processing. (5) Data from any number of observations, overlapping or not, may
be appended and processed together. (6) Any pixel density may be selected for
the final image. We present our algorithm, and evaluate it using both simulated

four continents, and now also Green Bank Observatory's 20-meter diameter radio

increasingly important topic in computer vision due to its widespread
applications in video surveillance, urban planning, and intelligence gathering.
However, it is essentially a challenging task because of the greatly varied
sizes of objects, coupled with severe occlusions and vague appearance of
extremely small individuals. Existing methods heavily rely on multi-column
learning architectures to extract multi-scale features, which however suffer
from heavy computational cost, especially undesired for crowd counting. In this
paper, we propose the single-column counting network (SCNet) for efficient
crowd counting without relying on multi-column networks. SCNet consists of
residual fusion modules (RFMs) for multi-scale feature extraction, a pyramid
pooling module (PPM) for information fusion, and a sub-pixel convolutional
module (SPCM) followed by a bilinear upsampling layer for resolution recovery.
Those proposed modules enable our SCNet to fully capture multi-scale features
in a compact single-column architecture and estimate high-resolution density
map in an efficient way. In addition, we provide a principled paradigm for
density map generation and data augmentation for training, which shows further
improved performance. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show
that our SCNet delivers new state-of-the-art performance and surpasses previous
methods by large margins, which demonstrates the great effectiveness of SCNet
as a single-column network for crowd counting.

their ubiquity. Therefore, digital evidence on smartphones plays an
increasingly important role in crime investigations. Digital evidence could
reside in the memory and permanent storage of a smartphone. While we have
witnessed significant progresses on memory forensics recently, identifying
evidence in the permanent storage is still an underdeveloped research area.
Most existing studies on permanent-storage forensics rely on manual analysis or
keyword-based scanning of the permanent storage. Manual analysis is costly,
while keyword matching often misses the evidentiary data that do not have
interesting keywords.
  In this work, we develop a tool called EviHunter to automatically identify
evidentiary data in the permanent storage of an Android device. There could be
thousands of files on the permanent storage of a smartphone. A basic question a
forensic investigator often faces is which files could store evidentiary data.
EviHunter aims to answer this question. Our intuition is that the evidentiary
data were produced by apps; and an app's code has rich information about the
types of data the app may write to a permanent storage and the files the data
are written to. Therefore, EviHunter first pre-computes an App Evidence
Database (AED) via static analysis of a large number of apps. The AED includes
the types of evidentiary data and files that store them for each app. Then,
EviHunter matches the files on a smartphone's permanent storage against the AED
to identify the files that could store evidentiary data.
  We evaluate EviHunter on benchmark apps and 8,690 real-world apps. Our
results show that EviHunter can precisely identify both the types of
evidentiary data and the files that store them.

telescope and MOJAVE VLBA monitoring programs. Jet shape of the source is found
to be conical on scales probed by the VLBA observations setting a lower limit
of about 0.1 on its unknown redshift. Nuclear opacity is dominated by
synchrotron self-absorption, with a wavelength-dependent core shift
$r_{\text{core[mas]}}\approx0.1\lambda_{[\text{cm}]}$ co-aligned with the
innermost jet direction. The turnover frequency of the synchrotron spectrum of
the VLBI core shifts towards lower frequencies as the flare propagates down the

mas/yr, comparing to results from traditional kinematics based on tracking
bright jet features. We have found indications that the gamma-ray production
zone in the source is located at large distances, 10-20 pc, from a central
engine, and could be associated with the stationary jet features. These
findings favour synchrotron self-Compton, possibly in a combination with
external Compton scattering by infrared seed photons from a slow sheath of the

halos of Burkert and of pseudo-isothermal type. The disk mass-to-light ratios
exhibit an asymmetric bimodal distribution with the dominant peak located at

both an adjusted baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and the significance of

the height range of the prominence, and can discern the increase with height of

measurement can also detect an outward moving BLOS due to the slow rise of the

in Fourier space labeled the vital area and are: (i) the channel mode - uniform

rest modes individually are not so significant compared to the channel and
zonal flow modes, however, the combined action of their multitude is dominant
over these two modes. These three mode types are governed by interplay of the
linear and nonlinear processes, leading to their interdependent dynamics. The
linear processes consist in disk flow nonmodality-modified classical MRI with a

wavevector angles in Fourier space - the transverse cascade. The channel mode
exhibits episodic bursts supplied by linear MRI growth, while the nonlinear
processes mostly oppose this, draining the channel energy and redistributing it
to the rest modes. As for the zonal flow, it does not have a linear source and
is fed by nonlinear interactions of the rest modes.

the display order of tokens. The difference in response rate varies based on
token position and display design. It is worth noting that the users respond to
the randomized-order variant at levels that are comparable to the fixed-order
variant. The effective selection of a subset of token questions is achieved by
extracting tokens that provide the highest information gain over user ratings.

unique spin and orbital physics for the Ni$^{2+}$ ions with a $3d^8$ electron
configuration in the tetrahedral crystal field environment and on a diamond
lattice Mott insulator. The superexchange interaction between the local moments
usually favors magnetic orders. Due to the particular electron configuration of
the Ni$^{2+}$ ion with a partially filled upper $t_{2g}$ level and a fully
filled lower $e_g$ level, the atomic spin-orbit coupling becomes active at the
linear order and would favor a spin-orbital-entangled singlet with quenched
local moments in the single-ion limit. Thus, the spin-orbital entanglement
competes with the superexchange and could drive the system to a quantum
critical point that separates the spin-orbital singlet and the magnetic order.
We further explore the effects of magnetic field and uniaxial pressure. The
non-trivial response to the magnetic field is intimately tied to the underlying
spin-orbital structure of the local moments. We discuss the future experiments
such as doping and pressure, and point out the correspondence between different
electron configurations.

Long-range charge oscillations in ionic liquids thus result from positional

frustration in the spin-glass ground state reduces correlation lengths.
Eventually, thermal fluctuations excite the system from its ground state, and

considered. Both cases support a wide spectrum of temperature scalings in
parameter space. For Maxwell electrodynamics, the T-linear in-plane resistivity
generally dominates at low temperatures and survives into higher temperatures
in a narrow strip-like manner. Meanwhile, the T-quadratic inverse Hall angle
dominates at high temperatures and extends down to lower temperatures. The
overlap between the T-linear in-plane resistivity and the T-quadratic inverse
Hall angle, if occurs, would generally present in the intermediate temperate
regime. The Born-Infeld case with $a>0$ is quite similar to the Maxwell case.

density and magnetic field. Moreover, the overlap can occur for strong charge

  Understanding to a New Language","10 pages, 4 figures, COLING 2018",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To deploy a spoken language understanding (SLU) model to a new language,
language transferring is desired to avoid the trouble of acquiring and labeling
a new big SLU corpus. Translating the original SLU corpus into the target
language is an attractive strategy. However, SLU corpora consist of plenty of
semantic labels (slots), which general-purpose translators cannot handle well,
not to mention additional culture differences. This paper focuses on the
language transferring task given a tiny in-domain parallel SLU corpus. The
in-domain parallel corpus can be used as the first adaptation on the general
translator. But more importantly, we show how to use reinforcement learning
(RL) to further finetune the adapted translator, where translated sentences
with more proper slot tags receive higher rewards. We evaluate our approach on
Chinese to English language transferring for SLU systems. The experimental
results show that the generated English SLU corpus via adaptation and
reinforcement learning gives us over 97% in the slot F1 score and over 84%
accuracy in domain classification. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the
proposed language transferring method. Compared with naive translation, our
proposed method improves domain classification accuracy by relatively 22%, and
the slot filling F1 score by relatively more than 71%.

sequential data and they have been applied to boost a variety of tasks such as

existing RNN models have been designed for sequences assumed to be identically

linked sequences are inherently not i.i.d., which poses tremendous challenges

unprecedented opportunities to build advanced RNN models. In this paper, we
study the problem of RNN for linked sequences. In particular, we introduce a

essential to describe a doped Mott antiferromagnet at finite doping.

with a weak irradiation effect for WD\,1144+011 can explain its single-hump
modulation, and the newly observed spectrum confirms its previous
classification. The synthetic analyses for the DN clearly indicate that phase
zero of the double-hump modulations occurs around the secondary minimum and the
primary hump is mainly caused by the hotspot at the edge of the disk. The
quiescent disk has a flat temperature distribution with a power index of
$\sim0.11$. The disk model of RZ\,Leo implies a truncated disk, supporting its

between providers can introduce inefficiencies in resource utilisation and
worsen overall system performance. In such cases, resource pooling between
independent service providers can be used to improve performance. However, for
providers to agree to pool their resources, the arrangement has to be mutually
beneficial. The traditional notion of resource pooling, which implies complete
sharing, need not have this property. For example, under full pooling, one of
the providers may be worse off and hence have no incentive to participate. In
this paper, we propose partial resource sharing models as a generalization of
full pooling, which can be configured to be beneficial to all participants.
  We formally define and analyze two partial sharing models between two service
providers, each of which is an Erlang-B loss system with the blocking
probabilities as the performance measure. We show that there always exist
partial sharing configurations that are beneficial to both providers,
irrespective of the load and the number of circuits of each of the providers. A
key result is that the Pareto frontier has at least one of the providers
sharing all its resources with the other. Furthermore, full pooling may not lie
inside this Pareto set. The choice of the sharing configurations within the
Pareto set is formalized based on bargaining theory. Finally, large system
approximations of the blocking probabilities in the quality-efficiency-driven
regime are presented.

not satisfied, the problem is severely ill-posed and one must apply a

regularization. In the case of full data, our simulations show that the CG

relation is usually given by a group action and the first step is always to
reduce the determinacy question to an ""infinitesimal determinacy"", i.e., to the
tangent spaces at the orbits of the group action. In this work we formulate a
universal, characteristic-free approach to finite determinacy, not necessarily
over a field, and for a large class of group actions. We do not restrict to

inviscid invariants across a huge range of scales, from where they are injected
to where they are dissipated. Recently, new experimental, numerical and
theoretical works have revealed that many turbulent configurations deviate from
the ideal 3D/2D isotropic cases characterized by the presence of a strictly
direct/inverse energy cascade, respectively. We review recent works from a
unified point of view and we present a classification of all known transfer
mechanisms. Beside the classical cases of direct and inverse cascades, the
different scenarios include: split cascades to small and large scales
simultaneously, multiple/dual cascades of different quantities, bi-directional
cascades where direct and inverse transfers of the same invariant coexist in
the same scale-range and finally equilibrium states where no cascades are
present, including the case when a condensate is formed. We classify all
transitions as the control parameters are changed and we analyse when and why
different configurations are observed. Our discussion is based on a set of
paradigmatic applications: helical turbulence, rotating and/or stratified
flows, MHD and passive/active scalars where the transfer properties are altered
as one changes the embedding dimensions, the thickness of the domain or other
relevant control parameters, as the Reynolds, Rossby, Froude, Peclet, or Alfven
numbers. We discuss the presence of anomalous scaling laws in connection with
the intermittent nature of the energy dissipation in configuration space. An
overview is also provided concerning cascades in other applications such as
bounded flows, quantum, relativistic and compressible turbulence, and active
matter, together with implications for turbulent modelling. Finally, we present
a series of open problems and challenges that future work needs to address.

where there are gapless points in the energy spectrum that give origin to the
lines (edges) separating the phases in the phase diagram. We consider a general
case of two-band models and present a sufficient condition for the existence of
gapless points, given there are pairs of parameter points for which the
fidelity between the corresponding states is zero. By presenting an explicit
counter-example, we showed that the sufficient condition is not necessary.
Further, we showed that, unless the set of parameter points is suitably
constrained, the existence of gapless points generically imply the accompanied
pairs of parameter points with vanishing fidelity. Also, we showed the
connection between the vanishing fidelity and gapless points on a number of
concrete examples (topological triplet superconductor, topological insulator,

by cosmological phase transitions (PTs), is of fundamental importance because
allows to probe the physics related to PT energy scales. Motivated by the
decisive role of non-zero quark chemical potential towards understanding
physics in the core of neutron stars, quark stars and heavy-ion collisions, in
this paper we qualitatively explore the stochastic background of GW spectrum
generated by a cosmological source such as high-density QCD first order PT
during the early Universe. Specifically, we calculate the frequency peak
$f_{peak}$ redshifted at today time and the fractional energy density
$\Omega_{gw}h^2$ in light of equation-of-state improved by the finite quark
(baryon) chemical potential (we consider an effective three flavor chiral
quarks model of QCD). Our calculations reveal a striking increase in $f_{peak}$
and $\Omega_{gw}h^2$ due to the quark chemical potential, which means to
improve the chances of detection, in possible future observations (in
particular SKA/PTA experiments), of the stochastic background of GWs from QCD
first order PT. Even if the improvements could be weak, by updating the
sensitivity of relevant detectors in the future, we can still remain hopeful.
Concerning the phenomenological contribution of QCD equation-of-state, and in
particular the possibility to detect a stochastic GW signal, we further show
that the role of the quark chemical potential is model-dependent. This feature
allows to discriminate among possible QCD effective models depending on their
capability to shed light on the dynamic of QCD-PT through future observations
of primordial GWs. In this perspective, the results are indeed encouraging to
employ the GWs to study the QCD PT in high density strong interaction matter.

optimizational perspective. In our formulation of the problem, instead of
dealing with raw data, we assume that our ground truth includes a mapping
${\mathbf f}: {\mathbb R}^n\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^m$ and a probability
distribution function $p$ over ${\mathbb R}^n$, both given analytically. We
formulate SDR as a problem of finding a function ${\mathbf g}: {\mathbb
R}^k\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^m$ and a matrix $P\in {\mathbb R}^{k\times n}$ such
that ${\mathbb E}_{{\mathbf x}\sim p({\mathbf x})} \left|{\mathbf f}({\mathbf
x}) - {\mathbf g}(P{\mathbf x})\right|^2$ is minimal. It turns out that the
latter problem allows a reformulation in the dual space, i.e. instead of
searching for ${\mathbf g}(P{\mathbf x})$ we suggest searching for its Fourier
transform. First, we characterize all tempered distributions that can serve as
the Fourier transform of such functions. The reformulation in the dual space
can be interpreted as a problem of finding a $k$-dimensional linear subspace
$S$ and a tempered distribution ${\mathbf t}$ supported in $S$ such that
${\mathbf t}$ is ""close"" in a certain sense to the Fourier transform of
${\mathbf f}$.
  Instead of optimizing over generalized functions with a $k$-dimensional
support, we suggest minimizing over ordinary functions but with an additional
term $R$ that penalizes a strong distortion of the support from any
$k$-dimensional linear subspace. For a specific case of $R$, we develop an
algorithm that can be formulated for functions given in the initial form as
well as for their Fourier transforms. Eventually, we report results of
numerical experiments with a discretized version of the latter algorithm.

decades, registering multimodal data [e.g., optical, LiDAR, SAR, and map]
remains a challenging problem because of significant nonlinear intensity
differences between such data. To address this problem, this paper presents a
fast and robust matching framework integrating local descriptors for multimodal
registration. In the proposed framework, a local descriptor, such as Histogram
of Oriented Gradient (HOG), Local Self Similarity (LSS), or Speeded-Up Robust
Feature (SURF), is first extracted at each pixel to form a pixel-wise feature
representation of an image. Then we define a similarity measure based on the
feature representation in frequency domain using the 3 Dimensional Fast Fourier
Transform (3DFFT) technique, followed by a template matching scheme to detect
control points between images. In this procedure, we also propose a novel
pixel-wise feature representation using orientated gradients of images, which
is named channel features of orientated gradients (CFOG). This novel feature is
an extension of the pixel-wise HOG descriptors, and outperforms that both in
matching performance and computational efficiency. The major advantage of the
proposed framework includes: (1) structural similarity representation using the
pixel-wise feature description and (2) high computational efficiency due to the
use of 3DFFT. Experimental results on different types of multimodal images show
the superior matching performance of the proposed framework than the
state-of-the-art methods.The proposed matching framework have been used in the
software products of a Chinese listed company. The matlab code is available in
this manuscript.

increased, Ni atoms turn into spin scattering centers, which is manifested
experimentally as a step-like change in the GMR of the multilayers. This
behavior is observed in multilayers with gradient-doped Cu spacers, where only
the inner region was doped with Ni. In the uniformly doped spacers the GMR
decreases monotonously with increasing Ni content, indicating that Ni atoms are
magnetic and act as spin relaxation centers in the entire dopant-concentration
range studied. We explain the difference in the observed GMR behavior as due to
a strong magnetic proximity effect in the uniform spacers, which is efficiently
suppressed in the gradient spacers. The observed magnetic phase transition is
fully supported by our detailed ab-initio calculations, taking into
consideration structural relaxation in the system as well as potential Ni
clustering. Controlling the loss or gain of the atomic magnetism for a specific

ensemble-based approach, called EnCoD, that leverages the solutions produced by
various disjoint community detection algorithms to discover the overlapping
community structure. Specifically, EnCoD generates a feature vector for each
vertex from the results of the base algorithms and learns which features lead
to detect densely connected overlapping regions in an unsupervised way. It
keeps on iterating until the likelihood of each vertex belonging to its own
community maximizes. Experiments on both synthetic and several real-world
networks (with known ground-truth community structures) reveal that EnCoD
significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art overlapping community detection
algorithms. Finally, we show that EnCoD is generic enough to be applied to
networks where the vertices are associated with explicit semantic features. To
the best of our knowledge, EnCoD is the second ensemble-based overlapping
community detection approach after MEDOC [1].

energy {\gamma} rays (VHE; E > 10 GeV) from cosmological sources alter their
{\gamma}-ray spectrum. The stronger absorption of harder {\gamma} rays causes a
steepening of the observed {\gamma}-ray spectrum at the high energy tail which
can be expressed by an increase of the power index. The effect provides a link
between high energy astrophysics and the evolution of galaxies. In this work we
develop a new hybrid EBL model by augmenting our previous analytic model with
information from semi-analytic galaxy catalogues. The model allows us to study
the {\gamma}-ray opacities of individual {\gamma}-ray paths through the
(simulated) universe and evaluate the effect of local fluctuations in the EBL
intensity along each path. We confirm an order of magnitude fluctuations in the
local EBL (based on the cumulative light from model galaxy distributions within
spheres of 50 $h^{-1}$Mpc). However, the effect of these fluctuations on the
VHE {\gamma}-ray opacity is insignificant due to the overall very small
contribution of the local EBL to the total EBL. We also investigate the effect
which a galaxy crossing the line of sight of the {\gamma}-ray source may have
on the VHE spectrum. We find that galaxies with stellar masses of M$ > 10^{11}$
M$_{\odot}$ could have significant effect on the {\gamma}-ray absorption. It is
unlikely that the observed variation in the spectral index is caused by the
proximity of single galaxies to the {\gamma}-ray paths as these are extremely
rare.

its discovery possible at CLIC when the resonance mass is in the range
$[2000,3000]$ GeV. In the second scenario, when the non-standard scalars are
light, the new vector boson is too broad to be recognized as a resonance and is
not detectable except when the mass of the scalars is close to (but smaller
than) a half of the resonance mass and the scale of the dark sector is high. In
all the positive cases, less than a tenth of the maximum integrated luminosity
is needed to reach the discovery level. Finally, we also comment about the
mono-$Z$ production.

the level of autonomy within the interaction when required; with
mixed-initiatives combining human preferences and automation's recommendations

the effective implementation of mixed-initiative systems raises fundamental
questions on how to combine human preferences and automation recommendations,
how to realise the selected level of autonomy, and what the future impacts on

Thus, it is very pivotal to detect the gap structure for understanding the
mechanism of superconductivity. In cuprate superconductors, it has been well
established that the superconducting gap may have a d-wave function {\Delta} =
{\Delta}_0cos2{\theta}. This gap function has an alternative sign change by
every pi/2 in the momentum space when the in-plane azimuthal angle theta is
scanned. It is very hard to visualize this sign change. Early experiments for
recommending or proving this d-wave gap function were accomplished by the
specially designed phase sensitive measurements based on the Josephson effect.
Here we report the measurements of scanning tunneling spectroscopy in one of
the model cuprate system Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} and conduct the analysis of
phase-referenced quasiparticle interference (QPI). Due to the unique
quasiparticle excitations in the superconducting state of cuprate, we have seen
the seven basic scattering vectors that connect each pair of the terminals of

phase-referenced QPI clearly visualizes the sign change of the d-wave gap. Our
results illustrate a very effective way for determining the sign change of

of applications in software engineering (e.g., plagiarism detection, bug
detection). The main challenge of the topic lies in the semantics-equivalent
code transformation (e.g., optimization, obfuscation) which would alter
representations of binary code tremendously. Another chal- lenge is the
trade-off between detection accuracy and coverage. Unfortunately, existing
techniques still rely on semantics-less code features which are susceptible to
the code transformation. Besides, they adopt merely either a static or a
dynamic approach to detect binary code clones, which cannot achieve high
accuracy and coverage simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a
semantics-based hybrid approach to detect binary clone functions. We execute a
template binary function with its test cases, and emulate the execution of
every target function for clone comparison with the runtime information
migrated from that template function. The semantic signatures are extracted
during the execution of the template function and emulation of the target
function. Lastly, a similarity score is calculated from their signatures to
measure their likeness. We implement the approach in a prototype system
designated as BinMatch which analyzes IA-32 binary code on the Linux platform.
We evaluate BinMatch with eight real-world projects compiled with different
compilation configurations and commonly-used obfuscation methods, totally
performing over 100 million pairs of function comparison. The experimental
results show that BinMatch is robust to the semantics-equivalent code
transformation. Besides, it not only covers all target functions for clone
analysis, but also improves the detection accuracy comparing to the

cells react to various treatments, the researcher can understand the underlying
biological processes at work. Experimental results shows the efficiency of the

Way and velocity dispersions of four globular clusters, we show that Weyl
gravity predictions without resorting to dark matter comply with observations

in baryonic modelling results a bracket of possible rotational velocities which
well encompasses the diversity in rotation curve construction. Such diversity
generally arises from differences in measurements of velocity anisotropy
parameter, and the circular speed and Galactocentric distance of the Sun.
Furthermore, we explore the ability of Weyl gravity to account for the inferred
acceleration of Abell cluster 1689.

Our discussion encompasses not only entropies but, potentially, any functional

etc. In particular, in dealing with generalized statistics in straightforward
fashion one may sometimes find that the first thermal law
$\frac{dS}{d\beta}=\beta\frac{d<U>}{d\beta}$ seems to be not respected. We show
here that, on the contrary, it is indeed obeyed by any system subject to a
Legendre extremization process, i.e., in all constrained entropic variational
problems.

of applications in machine learning (e.g., active learning, clustering, and
feature selection). In large-scale optimization, the parallel running time of
an algorithm is governed by its adaptivity, which measures the number of
sequential rounds needed if the algorithm can execute polynomially-many
independent oracle queries in parallel. While low adaptivity is ideal, it is
not sufficient for an algorithm to be efficient in practice -- there are many
applications of distributed submodular optimization where the number of
function evaluations becomes prohibitively expensive. Motivated by these
applications, we study the adaptivity and query complexity of submodular
maximization. In this paper, we give the first constant-factor approximation
algorithm for maximizing a non-monotone submodular function subject to a
cardinality constraint $k$ that runs in $O(\log(n))$ adaptive rounds and makes
$O(n \log(k))$ oracle queries in expectation. In our empirical study, we use
three real-world applications to compare our algorithm with several benchmarks
for non-monotone submodular maximization. The results demonstrate that our
algorithm finds competitive solutions using significantly fewer rounds and
queries.

Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. Recently, a
physics-informed machine-learning (PIML) approach has been proposed for
reconstructing the discrepancies in RANS-modeled Reynolds stresses. The merits
of the PIML framework has been demonstrated in several canonical incompressible
flows. However, its performance on high-Mach-number flows is still not clear.
In this work we use the PIML approach to predict the discrepancies in RANS
modeled Reynolds stresses in high-Mach-number flat-plate turbulent boundary
layers by using an existing DNS database. Specifically, the discrepancy
function is first constructed using a DNS training flow and then used to
correct RANS-predicted Reynolds stresses under flow conditions different from
the DNS. The machine-learning technique is shown to significantly improve
RANS-modeled turbulent normal stresses, the turbulent kinetic energy, and the
Reynolds-stress anisotropy. Improvements are consistently observed when
different training datasets are used. Moreover, a high-dimensional
visualization technique and distance metrics are used to provide a priori
assessment of prediction confidence based only on RANS simulations. This study
demonstrates that the PIML approach is a computationally affordable technique
for improving the accuracy of RANS-modeled Reynolds stresses for
high-Mach-number turbulent flows when there is a lack of experiments and
high-fidelity simulations.
