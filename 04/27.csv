regime often rely on a mean field approach based on the complex
Gross-Pitaevskii equations in a three-mode approximation, where only three
momentum states, the signal, pump and idler, are assumed to be significantly
occupied. This approximation, however, lacks a constraint to uniquely determine
the signal and idler momenta. In contrast, multimode numerical simulations and
experiments show a unique momentum structure for the OPO states. In this work
we show that an estimate for the signal momentum chosen by the system can be
found from a simple analysis of the pump-only configuration. We use this
estimate to investigate how the chosen signal momentum depends on the
properties of the drive.

out structure in gamma-ray burst (GRB) pulse light curves, giving each a
triple-peaked appearance at moderate signal-to-noise and a simple monotonic
appearance at low signal-to-noise. We minimize this effect by studying six very
bright GRB pulses (signal-to-noise generally $> 100$), discovering surprisingly
that each exhibits $\textit{complex time-reversible}$ wavelike residual
structures. These `mirrored' wavelike structures can have large amplitudes,
occur on short timescales, begin/end long before/after the onset of the
monotonic pulse component, and have pulse spectra that generally evolve hard to
soft, re-hardening at the time of each structural peak. Among other insights,
these observations help explain the existence of negative pulse spectral lags,
and allow us to conclude that GRB pulses are less common, more complex, and
have longer durations than previously thought. Because structured emission
mechanisms that can operate forwards and backwards in time seem unlikely, we
look to $\textit{kinematic}$ behaviors to explain the time-reversed light curve
structures. We conclude that each GRB pulse involves a single impactor
interacting with an independent medium. Either the material is distributed in a
bilaterally symmetric fashion, the impactor is structured in a bilaterally
symmetric fashion, or the impactor's motion is reversed such that it returns
along its original path of motion. The wavelike structure of the
time-reversible component suggests that radiation is being both produced and
absorbed/deflected dramatically, repeatedly, and abruptly from the monotonic
component.

leads to a phase shift which might be large enough to observe. The second

a specific measure of the modified spectra which can signal the presence of a
negative mean squared electric field. These ideas are implemented in the

reproduced for most models, depending on Teff, log g, or wavelength. Even if
the law with four terms is used, these disagreements still persist. Here we
introduce a new method that considerably improves the description of both the

atmospheres with spherical symmetry more accurately in environments such as
exoplanetary transits, eclipsing binaries, etc.
  The method introduced here is simple. Instead of considering all the $\mu $
points in the adjustment, as is traditional, we consider only the points until
the drop-off ($\mu_{cri}$) of each model. From this point, we impose a
condition ${I(\mu)}/{I (1)} = 0$. All calculations were performed by adopting
the least-squares method.

be positionally cross-matched with the second Gaia data release containing

fluctuations, $\Delta I$, in plume and interplume regions of a polar coronal
hole. These intensity fluctuations correspond to density fluctuations. Using
data from the \rev{Sun Watcher using Active Pixel System detector and Image
Processing} (SWAP) on \textit{Project for Onboard Autonomy (Proba2)}, our
results extend up to a height of about 1.35~$R_{\sun}$. One advantage of the
RMS analysis is that it does not rely on a detailed evaluation of the power
spectrum, which is limited by noise levels to low heights in the corona. The
RMS approach can be performed up to larger heights where the noise level is
greater, provided that the noise itself can be quantified. At low heights, both
the absolute $\Delta I$, and the amplitude relative to the mean intensity,
$\Delta I/I$, decrease with height. However, starting at about 1.2~$R_{\sun}$
$\Delta I/I$ increases, reaching 20--40\% by 1.35~$R_{\sun}$. This corresponds
to density fluctuations of $\Delta n_{\mathrm{e}}/n_{\mathrm{e}}
\approx$~10--20\%. The increasing relative amplitude implies that the density
fluctuations are generated in the corona itself. One possibility is that the
density fluctuations are generated by an instability of Alfv\'en waves. This
generation mechanism is consistent with some theoretical models and with
observations of Alfv\'en wave amplitudes in coronal holes. Although we find
that the energy of the observed density fluctuations is small, these
fluctuations are likely to play an important indirect role in coronal heating
by promoting the reflection of Alfv\'en waves and driving turbulence.

is kept confidential by external workers, and the learner has to interact
closely with those workers to train a model. In particular, we assume that
there exists a system adversary that can adaptively compromise some workers;
the compromised workers deviate from their local designed specifications by
sending out arbitrarily malicious messages.
  We assume in each communication round, up to $q$ out of the $m$ workers
suffer Byzantine faults. Each worker keeps a local sample of size $n$ and the
total sample size is $N=nm$. We propose a secured variant of the gradient
descent method that can tolerate up to a constant fraction of Byzantine
workers, i.e., $q/m = O(1)$. Moreover, we show the statistical estimation error
of the iterates converges in $O(\log N)$ rounds to $O(\sqrt{q/N} +
\sqrt{d/N})$, where $d$ is the model dimension. As long as $q=O(d)$, our
proposed algorithm achieves the optimal error rate $O(\sqrt{d/N})$. Our results

strongly-convex population risk. Nevertheless, the empirical risk (sample
version) is allowed to be non-convex. The core of our method is to robustly
aggregate the gradients computed by the workers based on the filtering
procedure proposed by Steinhardt et al. On the technical front, deviating from
the existing literature on robustly estimating a finite-dimensional mean
vector, we establish a {\em uniform} concentration of the sample covariance
matrix of gradients, and show that the aggregated gradient, as a function of

the implementation of quantum information protocols such as device-independent
secure communications. In particular, time-bin entanglement is widely exploited
to reach these purposes both in free-space and optical fiber propagation, due
to the robustness and simplicity of its implementation. However, all existing
realizations of time-bin entanglement suffer from an intrinsic postselection
loophole, which undermines their usefulness. Here, we report the first
experimental violation of Bell's inequality with ""genuine"" time-bin
entanglement, free of the postselection loophole. We introduced a novel
function of the interferometers at the two measurement stations, that operate
as fast synchronized optical switches. This scheme allowed to obtain a
postselection-loophole-free Bell violation of more than nine standard
deviations. Since our scheme is fully implementable using standard fiber-based
components and is compatible with modern integrated photonics, our results pave
the way for the distribution of genuine time-bin entanglement over long
distances.

simulations of molecular clouds before the onset of stellar feedback. The
clouds are modelled within the SILCC-Zoom project and are embedded in their
galactic environment. The radiative transfer is carried out with POLARIS for
wavelengths from 70 $\mu$m to 3 mm at a resolution of 0.12 pc, and includes
self-consistently calculated alignment efficiencies for radiative torque
alignment. We explore the reason of the observed depolarisation in the center
of molecular clouds: We find that dust grains remain well aligned even at high
densities ($n$ $>$ 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$) and visual extinctions ($A_\text{V}$ $>$
1). The depolarisation is rather caused by strong variations of the magnetic
field direction along the LOS due to turbulent motions. The observed magnetic
field structure thus resembles best the mass-weighted, line-of-sight averaged
field structure. Furthermore, it differs by only a few 1$^\circ$ for different
wavelengths and is little affected by the spatial resolution of the synthetic
observations. Noise effects can be reduced by convolving the image. Doing so,
for $\lambda$ $\gtrsim$ 160 $\mu$m the observed magnetic field traces reliably
the underlying field in regions with intensities $I$ $\gtrsim$ 2 times the
noise level and column densities above 1 M$_\text{sun}$ pc$^{-2}$. Here,
typical deviations are $\lesssim$ 10$^\circ$. The observed structure is less
reliable in regions with low polarisation degrees and possibly in regions with
large column density gradients. Finally, we show that a simplified and widely
used method without self-consistent dust alignment efficiencies can provide a
good representation of the observable polarisation structure with deviations
below 5$^\circ$.

fundamental goal of the Kepler transiting exoplanet mission, and could be
improved with K2 and TESS. Deriving accurate exoplanetary radii requires
accurate measurements of the host star radii and the planetary transit depths,
including accounting for any ""third light"" in the system due to nearby bound
companions or background stars. High-resolution imaging of Kepler and K2 planet
candidate hosts to detect very close (within ~0.5"") background or bound stellar
companions has been crucial for both confirming the planetary nature of
candidates, and the determination of accurate planetary radii and mean
densities. Here we present an investigation of the effect of close companions,
both detected and undetected, on the observed (raw count) exoplanet radius
distribution. We demonstrate that the recently detected ""gap"" in the observed
radius distribution (also seen in the completeness-corrected distribution) is
fairly robust to undetected stellar companions, given that all of the systems
in the sample have undergone some kind of vetting with high-resolution imaging.
However, while the gap in the observed sample is not erased or shifted, it is
partially filled in after accounting for possible undetected stellar
companions. These findings have implications for the most likely core
composition, and thus formation location, of super-Earth and sub-Neptune
planets. Furthermore, we show that without high-resolution imaging of planet
candidate host stars, the shape of the observed exoplanet radius distribution

numerically compute a solution. Then one uses fixed-point arguments, including
a combination of analytical and validated numerical estimates, to prove that
the computed solution has a true solution in a suitable neighbourhood. We
demonstrate our approach by computing minimum-energy transition paths via
invariant manifolds and heteroclinic connections. We illustrate our method in

is a field of mathematics which enables us to consider the randomness of an
individual infinite sequence. We then present an operational refinement of the

amplitude and phase of the acoustic oscillations provide information about
whether the extra species are free-streaming particles, like neutrinos, or
tightly-coupled, like the photons, during eras probed by the CMB. On the other
hand, some extensions of the Standard Model produce new relativistic particles
that decouple from their own non-gravitational interactions after neutrinos,

decouple during this intermediate epoch. We argue that the decoupling species
will cause a scale-dependent change in the amplitude and phase shift of the
acoustic oscillations, different from the usual constant shifts on small
scales. For intermediate decoupling times, the phase and amplitude shifts
depend not only on $\Delta N_{eff}$ but the redshift $z_{dec,X}$ at which the
new species decoupled. For $\Delta N_{eff} >0.334$, a Stage IV CMB experiment
could determine $N_{eff}$ at the percent level and $z_{dec,X}$ at the $\sim

$z_{dec,X}$ weaken but remain $\sim 20-50\%$ for $z_{dec,X} \sim

a Partially Observable (PO) Markov Decision Process (MDP) is formulated, where
the system state corresponds to the position of the MU within the road link.
The goal is to maximize the number of bits delivered by the BS to the MU over
the communication session, under a power constraint. The resulting optimal

some of its astrophysical consequences. We focus here on toroidal magnetic
fields as motivated by already known magnetars with low dipolar magnetic fields

electrodynamics leads to larger toroidal magnetic fields when compared to
Maxwell's electrodynamics. Hence, one should expect higher production of
gravitational waves (GWs) and even more energetic giant flares from nonlinear
stars. Given current constraints on BI's scale field, giant flare energetics
and magnetic fields in magnetars, we also find that the maximum magnitude of
magnetar ellipticities should be $10^{-6}-10^{-5}$. Besides, BI electrodynamics
may lead to a maximum increase of order $10\%-20\%$ of the GW energy radiated

between rooted trees on $n$ nodes in $\mathcal{O}(n^{3})$ time. However,
generalizing their method to unrooted trees seems quite problematic, and the
most efficient known solution remains to be the previous $\mathcal{O}(n^{3}\log

this complexity, it might appear that unrooted trees are simply more difficult
than rooted trees. We show that this is, in fact, not the case, and edit
distance between unrooted trees on $n$ nodes can be computed in

deterministic time evolution of the state, interspersed by random discrete
events. Within this general class of systems, we consider time-triggered
stochastic hybrid systems (TTSHS), where the state evolves continuously
according to a linear time-varying dynamical system. Discrete events occur
based on an underlying renewal process (timer), and the intervals between
successive events follow an arbitrary continuous probability density function.
Moreover, whenever the event occurs, the state is reset based on a linear
affine transformation that allows for the inclusion of state-dependent and
independent noise terms. Our key contribution is derivation of necessary and
sufficient conditions for the stability of statistical moments, along with
exact analytical expressions for the steady-state moments. These results are
illustrated on an example from cell biology, where deterministic synthesis and
decay of a gene product (RNA or protein) is coupled to random timing of
cell-division events. As experimentally observed, cell-division events occur
based on an internal timer that measures the time elapsed since the start of
cell cycle (i.e., last event). Upon division, the gene product level is halved,
together with a state-dependent noise term that arises due to randomness in the
partitioning of molecules between two daughter cells. We show that the TTSHS
framework is conveniently suited to capture the time evolution of gene product
levels, and derive unique formulas connecting its mean and variance to
underlying model parameters and noise mechanisms. Systematic analysis of the
formulas reveal counterintuitive insights, such as, if the partitioning noise
is large then making the timing of cell division more random reduces noise in
gene product levels.

is prevented from learning any information about the messages. The information
theoretic capacity of ETPIR is defined to be the maximum number of desired
message symbols retrieved privately per information symbol downloaded. We show
that the capacity of ETPIR is $C = \left( 1- \frac{E}{N} \right) \left(1 +
\frac{T-E}{N-E} + \cdots + \left( \frac{T-E}{N-E} \right)^{K-1} \right)^{-1}$
when $E < T$, and $C = \left( 1 - \frac{E}{N} \right)$ when $E \geq T$. To
achieve the capacity, the servers need to share a common random variable
(independent of the messages), and its size must be at least $\frac{E}{N} \cdot
\frac{1}{C}$ symbols per message symbol. Otherwise, with less amount of shared
common randomness, ETPIR is not feasible and the capacity reduces to zero.
  An interesting observation is that the ETPIR capacity expression takes
different forms in two regimes. When $E < T$, the capacity equals the inverse
of a sum of a geometric series with $K$ terms and decreases with $K$; this form
is typical for capacity expressions of PIR. When $E \geq T$, the capacity does
not depend on $K$, a typical form for capacity expressions of SPIR (symmetric
PIR, which further requires data-privacy, {\it i.e.,} the user learns no
information about other undesired messages); the capacity does not depend on
$T$ either. In addition, the ETPIR capacity result includes multiple previous
PIR and SPIR capacity results as special cases.

Galaxy, is affected by several phenomena. For example, the bar and the spiral
arms of the Milky Way induce radial migration of stars and can trap or scatter
stars close to orbital resonances. External perturbations from satellite
galaxies can also have a role, causing dynamical heating of the Galaxy,
ring-like structures in the disk and correlations between different components
of the stellar velocity. These perturbations can also cause 'phase wrapping'
signatures in the disk, such as arched velocity structures in the motions of
stars in the Galactic plane. Some manifestations of these dynamical processes
have already been detected, including kinematic substructure in samples of
nearby stars, density asymmetries and velocities across the Galactic disk that
differ from the axisymmetric and equilibrium expectations, especially in the
vertical direction, and signatures of incomplete phase mixing in the disk. Here
we report an analysis of the motions of six million stars in the Milky Way
disk. We show that the phase-space distribution contains different
substructures with various morphologies, such as snail shells and ridges, when
spatial and velocity coordinates are combined. We infer that the disk must have
been perturbed between 300 million and 900 million years ago, consistent with
estimates of the previous pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
Our findings show that the Galactic disk is dynamically young and that
modelling it as time-independent and axisymmetric is incorrect.

the complexity of a proper description of a halo (environmental effects, merger
history, nonsphericity, relaxation state), when the mass is scaled by the
nonlinear mass scale $M_\star(z)$, we find that a simple non-power-law form for
the $c-M/M_\star$ relation provides an excellent description of our simulation
results across eight decades in $M/M_{\star}$ and for $0\leq z \leq 4$. Over

approximate power law below a mass threshold $M/M_\star\sim 500-1000$,
transitioning to a constant value, $c_0\sim 3$ at higher masses. The relaxed
halo fraction decreases with mass, transitioning to a constant value of $\sim
0.5$ above the same mass threshold. We compare Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and
Einasto fits to stacked profiles in narrow mass bins at different redshifts; as
expected, the Einasto profile provides a better description of the simulation

and then adopting the radiative transfer code SKIRT to apply dust extinction.
We apply our technique to NGC 4552 and NGC 4494, two nearby ETGs. We show that
the extinction by a dust ring can mimic, in a surface brightness profile, a
central point source (e.g. an unresolved nuclear stellar cluster or an active

the stellar light commonly observed in massive ETGs). We discuss how properly
accounting for dust features is of paramount importance to derive correct
fluxes especially for low luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs). We suggest that the
geometries of dust features are strictly connected with how relaxed is the

spectral type and distance to 145 KOIs with nearby stars using multi-band

Kepler planetary candidate are likely bound, in agreement with past studies. We
use likely bound stars as well as the precise stellar parameters from the
California Kepler Survey to search for correlations between stellar binarity
and planetary properties. No significant difference between the binarity
fraction of single and multiple planet systems is found, and planet hosting
stars follow similar binarity trends as field stars, many of which likely host
their own non-aligned planets. We find that hot Jupiters are ~4x more likely
than other planets to reside in a binary star system. We correct the radius
estimates of the planet candidates in characterized systems and find that for
likely bound systems, the estimated planetary candidate radii will increase on
average by a factor of 1.77, if either star is equally likely to host the

non-relativistic Fermi gases in several two and three dimensional geometries.
The tools of second-order hydrodynamics and gauge-gravity duality will be
utilized to address this system. Many of the themes of this work are motivated
by the observed similarities in transport properties between strongly
interacting Fermi gases and other very different strongly interacting quantum
fluids such as the quark-gluon plasma, high temperature superconductors, and
quantum field theories described by gauge-gravity duality. In particular, these
systems all nearly saturate the conjectured lower bound on the ratio of shear
viscosity to entropy density $\eta/s \geq \hbar/(4 \pi k_B)$ coming from the
AdS/CFT correspondence. Among other things, this observation, in conjunction
with current experiment and data analysis in atomic, condensed matter, and
nuclear physics lends itself to the following questions: How perfect of a fluid
is the strongly interacting Fermi gas, and can one find a more stringent
constraint on $\eta/s$ in Fermi gases? Do the similarities in transport
properties among strongly interacting quantum systems extend beyond dynamics
controlled by the hydrodynamical shear viscosity? In regards to the first
question, by utilizing second-order hydrodynamics, it will be demonstrated that
higher-order collective modes of a harmonically trapped Fermi gas may serve as
a more sensitive probe of the shear viscosity. For the second question, both
second-order hydrodynamics and a gravity dual theory are used to make
predictions about dynamics occurring on short timescales where hydrodynamics is
expected to break down. In particular the appearance of a class of
""non-hydrodynamic"" collective modes not contained within a Navier-Stokes
description of the strongly interacting Fermi gas will be discussed.

vicinities of 23 known SNRs in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using the star
formation history (SFH) maps of Harris & Zaritsky (2004). We combine the
results with constraints on the SNR metal abundances and environment from X-ray
and optical observations. We find that 22 SNRs in the SMC have local SFHs and
properties consistent with a CC explosion, several of which are likely to have
been high-mass progenitors. This result supports recent theoretical findings
that high-mass progenitors can produce successful explosions. We estimate the
mass distribution of the CC progenitors and find that this distribution is
similar to a Salpeter IMF (within the uncertainties), while this result is
shallower than the mass distribution found in M31 and M33 by Jennings et al.
(2014) and D\'{\i}az-Rodr\'{\i}guez et al. (2018) using a similar approach.
Additionally, we find that a number of the SMC SNRs exhibit a burst of star
formation between 50-200 Myr ago. As these sources are likely CC, this
signature may be indicative of massive stars undergoing delayed CC as a
consequence of binary interaction, rapid rotation, or low metallicity. In
addition, the lack of Type Ia SNRs in the SMC is possibly a result of the short
visibility times of these sources as they may fall below the sensitivity limits
of current radio observations.

stars which account for radiation forces as well as photoionization feedback
(along with protostellar outflows). In two different accretion scenarios
modeled, we determine the relative strength of these feedback components and
derive the size of the reservoir from which the forming stars gained their
masses.
  We find that protostellar outflows alone limit the stellar mass growth only
in an accretion scenario with a finite mass reservoir; when including accretion
and ram pressure from large scales (> 0.1 pc), protostellar outflows do not
limit stellar mass growth at all. Photoionization and HII regions dominate the
feedback ladder only at later times and only on large scales. Specifically,
photoionization yields a broadening of the bipolar outflow cavities and a
reduction of the gravitational infall momentum by about 50 percent, but does
not limit the stellar mass accretion. On the other hand, we find radiation
forces restrain the gravitational infall toward the circumstellar disk, impact
the gravito-centrifugal equilibrium at the outer edge of the disk, and
eventually shut down stellar accretion completely. The most massive star formed
in the simulations accreted 95 solar masses before disk destruction; this mass
was drawn-in from an accretion reservoir of approximately 240 solar masses and
0.24 pc in radius.
  In the regime of very massive stars, the final mass of these stars is
controlled by their own radiation force feedback.

exponentially many degrees of freedom is replaced by approximate classical
nonlinear dynamics with the number of degrees of freedom (phase space

on generalization of the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) to a higher
dimensional phase space, where phase space variables are associated with a
complete set of quantum operators spanning finite size clusters. The method
becomes asymptotically exact with the increasing cluster size. The crucial
feature of TWA is fluctuating initial conditions, which we approximate by a
Gaussian distribution. We show that such fluctuations dramatically increase
accuracy of TWA over traditional cluster mean field approximations. In this way
we can treat on equal footing quantum and thermal fluctuations as well as
compute entanglement and various equal and non-equal time correlation
functions. The main limitation of the method is exponential scaling of the
phase space dimensionality with the cluster size, which can be significantly
reduced by using the language of Schwinger bosons and can likely be further
reduced by truncating the local Hilbert space variables. We demonstrate the
power of this method analyzing dynamics in various spin chains with and without

and momentum into the interstellar medium (ISM). They might disperse the local
ISM, change its turbulent multi-phase structure, and even regulate star
formation. Ionizing radiation dominates the massive stars' energy output, but
the relative effect of winds might change with stellar mass and the properties
of the ambient ISM. We present simulations of the interaction of stellar winds
and ionizing radiation of 12, 23, and 60 M$_{\odot}$ stars within a cold
neutral (CNM, $n_{0}$ = 100 cm$^{-3}$), warm neutral (WNM, $n_{0}$ = 1, 10
cm$^{-3}$) or warm ionized (WIM, $n_{0}$ = 0.1 cm$^{-3}$) medium. The FLASH
simulations adopt the novel tree-based radiation transfer algorithm TreeRay.
With the On-the-Spot approximation and a temperature-dependent recombination
coefficient, it is coupled to a chemical network with radiative heating and
cooling. In the homogeneous CNM, the total momentum injection ranges from
1.6$\times$10$^{4}$ to 4$\times$10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$ and is always
dominated by the expansion of the ionized H$_{\text{II}}$ region. In the WIM,
stellar winds dominate (2$\times$10$^{2}$ to 5$\times$10$^{3}$ M$_{\odot}$ km
s$^{-1}$), while the input from radiation is small ($\sim$ 10$^{2}$ M$_{\odot}$
km s$^{-1}$). The WNM ($n_{0}$ = 1 cm$^{-3}$) is a transition regime.
Energetically, stellar winds couple more efficiently to the ISM ($\sim$ 0.1
percent of wind luminosity) than radiation ($<$ 0.001 percent of ionizing
luminosity). For estimating the impact of massive stars, the strongly
mass-dependent ratios of wind to ionizing luminosity and the properties of the
ambient medium have to be considered.

7 was analyzed. Three QSO sub-samples were defined, taking into account the
projected separations and radial velocity differences with neighboring

galaxy interactions, with projected separations smaller than 70 kpc, and
between 70 and 140 kpc, respectively, and with radial velocity differences less
than $5000~$\kms. These sub-samples were compared with isolated QSOs defined as
having greater projected separations and radial velocity differences to the
galaxies. From a statistical study of the EWs of relevant spectral lines in the
QSOs, we show an increment of the EWs of about 20\% in the [OIII]4959,5007
lines and 7\% in H$_\alpha$ for QSOs with stronger galaxy interactions relative
to the isolated QSOs. These results indicate that some line EWs of QSOs could
be marginally influenced by the environment and that they are not affected by
the emission of the host galaxy, which was estimated to be around 10\% of the
total emission. Furthermore, in order to gain a better understanding of the
origin of the H$_{\alpha}$ emission line, we performed broad and narrow line
decomposition in 100 QSOs in the restricted Sint sub-sample and also 100
randomly selected QSOs in the Iso sub-sample. When these QSOs were compared,
the narrow component remained constant whereas the broad component was
incremented. Our results, which reveal slight differences in EWs of some

Programming that relies on a variation of Temporal Equilibrium Logic (TEL) for

over infinite traces with the computational capacity of (incremental) Answer
Set Programming (ASP). Also, we argue that finite traces are more natural when
reasoning about action and change. As a result, our approach is readily
implementable via multi-shot ASP systems and benefits from an extension of
ASP's full-fledged input language with temporal operators. This includes future
as well as past operators whose combination offers a rich temporal modeling
language. For computation, we identify the class of temporal logic programs and
prove that it constitutes a normal form for our approach. Finally, we outline
two implementations, a generic one and an extension of clingo.

state of their nuclei. Recently, parameterized sublimative torque models have
been developed to study rotation state changes of individual comet nuclei and
populations of cometary bodies. However, these models simplify the interactions
between the escaping gas and cometary surface into only a few parameters that
hide the details of these complex interactions. Here we directly compare the
X-parameter model (Samarasinha & Mueller, 2013) with the SYORP model (Steckloff
& Jacobson, 2016) to tease out insights into the details of the gas-surface
interactions driving sublimative torques. We find that, for both of these
models to accurately model sublimative torques, the number of sublimating
molecules that contribute to the net torque is largely independent of the
detailed shape and activity of the nucleus, but rather depends primarily on the
size of the nucleus and the effective heliocentric distance of the comet. We
suggest that cometary activity must be largely restricted to regions of steep
gravitational surface slopes (above the angle of repose), where mass wasting
can refresh activity by shedding mantles of refractory materials and exposing
fresh volatiles. We propose a new classification scheme for comets based on the
frequency of this mass-wasting process (relative to the timescale of activity
fading): quasi-equilibrium, episodic, quasi-dormant, and extinct.

PLP, inference is performed by summarizing the possible worlds which entail the
query in a suitable data structure, and using it to compute the answer
probability. Systems such as ProbLog, PITA, etc., use propositional data
structures like explanation graphs, BDDs, SDDs, etc., to represent the possible
worlds. While this approach saves inference time due to substructure sharing,
there are a number of problems where a more compact data structure is possible.
We propose a data structure called Ordered Symbolic Derivation Diagram (OSDD)
which captures the possible worlds by means of constraint formulas. We describe
a program transformation technique to construct OSDDs via query evaluation, and
give procedures to perform exact and approximate inference over OSDDs. Our
approach has two key properties. Firstly, the exact inference procedure is a
generalization of traditional inference, and results in speedup over the latter
in certain settings. Secondly, the approximate technique is a generalization of
likelihood weighting in Bayesian Networks, and allows us to perform
sampling-based inference with lower rejection rate and variance. We evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed techniques through experiments on several
problems. This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

soft-band temperatures in the narrow range [1-3]$\times10^{6}$ K, independent
of the stellar wind parameters and the evolutionary stage of the central star.
We discuss the origin of this X-ray temperature for planetary nebulae (PNe),
Wolf-Rayet nebulae (WR) and interstellar wind bubbles around hot young stars in
our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. We calculate the differential emission
measure (DEM) distributions as a function of temperature from previously
published simulations and combine these with the X-ray emission coefficient for
the 0.3-2.0 keV band to estimate the X-ray temperatures. We find that all
simulated nebulae have DEM distributions with steep negative slopes, which is
due to turbulent mixing at the interface between the hot shocked stellar wind
and the warm photoionised gas. Sharply peaked emission coefficients act as
temperature filters and emphasize the contribution of gas with temperatures
close to the peak position, which coincides with the observed X-ray
temperatures for the chemical abundance sets we consider. Higher metallicity
nebulae have lower temperature and higher luminosity X-ray emission. We show
that the second temperature component found from spectral fitting to X-ray
observations of WR nebulae is due to a significant contribution from the hot
shocked stellar wind, while the lower temperature principal component is

nearly continuous coverage from quarter 11 through quarter 17 (589 days between
2011 and 2013) and examined some of their flux variability properties. We
investigate the possibility that the light curve is dominated by a large number
of individual flares and adopt exponential rise and decay models to investigate
the symmetry properties of flares. We found that those variations of W2R
1926+42 are predominantly asymmetric with weak tendencies toward positive
asymmetry (rapid rise and slow decay). The durations (D) and the amplitudes
(F0) of flares can be fit with log-normal distributions. The energy (E) of each
flare is also estimated for the first time. There are positive correlations
between logD and logE with a slope of 1.36, and between logF0 and logE with a
slope of 1.12. Lomb-Scargle periodograms are used to estimate the power
spectral density (PSD) shape. It is well described by a power law with an index
ranging between -1.1 and -1.5. The sizes of the emission regions, R, are
estimated to be in the range of 1.1*10^15 cm - 6.6*10^16 cm. The flare
asymmetry is difficult to explain by a light travel time effect but may be
caused by differences between the timescales for acceleration and dissipation
of high-energy particles in the relativistic jet. A jet-in-jet model also could
produce the observed log-normal distributions.

fundamental objective of multiple testing procedures is to reject as many false

rate (FWER) or false discovery rate (FDR). In this paper we formulate multiple
testing of simple hypotheses as an infinite-dimensional optimization problem,
seeking the most powerful rejection policy which guarantees strong control of

lattice in which flux arises by coupling several internal states. Starting from
a high symmetry optical flux lattice, we superpose a scalar potential with a
super- or sublattice period in order to eliminate links between the original
lattice sites. As an alternative to changing connectivity, the approach can
also be used to create or remove lattice sites from the underlying parent
lattice. To demonstrate our concept, we consider the dice lattice geometry as
an explicit example, and construct a dice lattice with a flux density of half a
flux quantum per plaquette, providing a pathway to flat bands with a large band
gap. While the intuition for our proposal stems from analysis of deep optical
lattices, we demonstrate that the approach is robust even for shallow optical
flux lattices far from the tight-binding limit. We also provide an alternative
experimental proposal to realize a synthetic gauge field in a fully frustrated
dice lattice based on laser-induced hoppings along individual bonds of the
lattice, again involving a superlattice potential. In this approach, atoms with
a long-lived excited state are trapped using an 'anti-magic' wavelength of
light, allowing the desired complex hopping elements to be induced in a
specific laser coupling scheme for the dice lattice geometry. We conclude by
comparing the complexity of these alternative approaches, and advocate that
complex optical flux lattices provide the more elegant and easily generalisable
strategy.

coefficient between pairs of stocks has been the usual way to determine network
edges. Recently, possible effects of nonlinearity on the graph-theoretical
properties of such networks have been demonstrated when using nonlinear
measures such as mutual information instead of linear correlation. In this
paper, we quantitatively characterize the nonlinearity in stock time series and
the effect it has on stock network properties. This is achieved by a systematic
multi-step approach that allows us to quantify the nonlinearity of coupling;
correct its effects wherever it is caused by simple univariate non-Gaussianity;
potentially localize in space and time any remaining strong sources of this
nonlinearity; and, finally, study the effect nonlinearity has on global network
properties. By applying this multi-step approach to stocks included in three
prominent indices (NYSE100, FTSE100 and SP500), we establish that the apparent
nonlinearity that has been observed is largely due to univariate
non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, strong nonstationarity in a few specific stocks

regions for near-Earth objects (NEOs) provide a fundamental frame of reference
for studies of individual NEOs and more complex population-level questions. We
present a new four-dimensional model of the NEO population that describes
debiased steady-state distributions of semimajor axis, eccentricity,
inclination, and absolute magnitude $H$ in the range $17<H<25$. The modeling
approach improves upon the methodology originally developed by Bottke et al.
(2000; Science 288, 2190-2194) in that it is, for example, based on more
realistic orbit distributions and uses source-specific absolute-magnitude
distributions that allow for a power-law slope that varies with $H$. We divide
the main asteroid belt into six different entrance routes or regions (ER) to
the NEO region: the $\nu_6$, 3:1J, 5:2J and 2:1J resonance complexes as well as
Hungarias and Phocaeas. In addition we include the Jupiter-family comets as the
primary cometary source of NEOs. We calibrate the model against NEO detections
by Catalina Sky Surveys' stations 703 and G96 during 2005-2012, and utilize the
complementary nature of these two systems to quantify the systematic
uncertainties associated to the resulting model. The most important ERs are the
$\nu_6$ and 3:1J resonance complexes with JFCs contributing a few percent of
NEOs on average. We predict that there are $962^{+52}_{-56}$
($802^{+48}_{-42}\times10^3$) NEOs with $H<17.75$ ($H<25$) and these numbers
are in agreement with the most recent estimates found in the literature (the
uncertainty estimates only account for the random component).

means that the columns (or rows) of the matrix to be completed are points on a
low-dimensional linear algebraic variety. This paper extends this thinking to
cases where the columns are points on a low-dimensional nonlinear algebraic
variety, a problem we call Low Algebraic Dimension Matrix Completion (LADMC).
Matrices whose columns belong to a union of subspaces are an important special
case. We propose a LADMC algorithm that leverages existing LRMC methods on a
tensorized representation of the data. For example, a second-order tensorized
representation is formed by taking the Kronecker product of each column with
itself, and we consider higher order tensorizations as well. This approach will
succeed in many cases where traditional LRMC is guaranteed to fail because the
data are low-rank in the tensorized representation but not in the original
representation. We provide a formal mathematical justification for the success
of our method. In particular, we give bounds of the rank of these data in the
tensorized representation, and we prove sampling requirements to guarantee
uniqueness of the solution. We also provide experimental results showing that
the new approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for matrix
completion under a union of subspaces model.

short-range ones. We find that the BPD algorithm works more efficiently for
fractal networks than for non-fractal networks, whereas the opposite is true of

paper, we address the sampling aspects of the problem of learning nonstationary

second model uses a stationary GP representing a latent space corresponding to
changes in dynamics, or the nonstationarity characteristics of the first model.
LISAL involves adaptively sampling the latent space dynamics using information

Killing spinor is Hermitian. Once the existence of a Hermitian Killing vector
is guaranteed, one can use a characterisation of the Kerr spacetime due to Mars

the Kerr family in the black hole holograph construction. Our analysis sheds

at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The detector consists of a
standard triple GEM amplification region and a drift region where ions drift. A
method has been developed to measure the ions' arrival time at a cathode
wire-grid by differentiating the recorded signals on this electrode.
Simulations prove that this method is accurate and robust. The ion mobility in
different gas mixtures is measured while applying different drift field values
ranging from 200 V cm$^{-1}$ to 1100 V cm$^{-1}$. From an extrapolation of a
Blanc's law fit to measurements in Ar-CO$_2$ mixtures we find the reduced
mobility of the drifting (cluster) ion species in pure argon to be
$1.94\pm0.01$ cm$^{2}$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ and in pure carbon-dioxide to be
$1.10\pm0.01$ cm$^{2}$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$. Applying the same procedure to our
measurements in Ne-CO$_2$ yields $4.06\pm0.07$ cm$^{2}$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ and
$1.09\pm0.01$ cm$^{2}$ V$^{- 1}$ s$^{-1}$ for the reduced mobilities in pure
neon and carbon-dioxide, respectively. Admixtures of N$_2$ to Ne-CO$_2$ reduce
somewhat the mobility. For the baseline gas mixture of the future ALICE Time
Projection Chamber, Ne- CO$_2$-N$_{2}$ (90-10-5), the measured reduced mobility
of the drifting ions is $2.92\pm0.04$ cm$^{2}$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$. Ion
mobilities are examined for different water content ranging from 70 ppm to
about 2000 ppm in the gas using Ar-CO$_2$ (90-10) and Ne-CO$_2$ (90-10). A

Prior to Chang et al.(2017 NF 57 11), studies of the tokamak edge have been
mostly confined to reduced fluid models and simplified geometries, leaving out
important pieces of physics. Here, we analyze the results of a DIII-D
simulation performed with the full-f gyrokinetic code XGC1 which includes both
turbulence and neoclassical effects in realistic divertor geometry. More
specifically, we calculate the particle and heat ExB fluxes along the

find that the density SOL width is impacted almost exclusively by the turbulent
electron flux. In this simulation, the level of edge turbulence is regulated by
a mechanism we are only beginning to understand: $\nabla B$-drifts and ion
X-point losses at the top and bottom of the machine, along with ion banana
orbits at the low field side (LFS), result in a complex poloidal potential
structure at the separatrix which is the cause of the ExB drift pattern that we
observe. Turbulence is being suppressed by the shear flows that this potential
generates. At the same time, turbulence, along with increased edge
collisionality and electron inertia, can influence the shape of the potential
structure by making the electrons non-adiabatic. Moreover, being the only means
through which the electrons can lose confinement, it needs to be in a balance
with the original direct ion orbit losses to maintain charge neutrality.

diffusing SN energy to the lower density outskirts. We therefore run gas
dynamical simulations of galactic outflows from a galaxy contained in a halo

creates a large-scale biconical outflow. CRs diffusing into the disk are unable
to entrain its gas in the outflows, yielding a mass-loading rate of only
$\sim0.1~\%$ with varied CR diffusion coefficients. We find no significant
difference in mass-loading rates in SN driven outflows with or without CR

networks to maps invariant or equivariant with respect to linear
representations of groups. Our goal is to establish network-like computational
models that are both invariant/equivariant and provably complete in the sense
of their ability to approximate any continuous invariant/equivariant map. Our
contribution is three-fold. First, in the general case of compact groups we
propose a construction of a complete invariant/equivariant network using an
intermediate polynomial layer. We invoke classical theorems of Hilbert and Weyl
to justify and simplify this construction; in particular, we describe an
explicit complete ansatz for approximation of permutation-invariant maps.
Second, we consider groups of translations and prove several versions of the
universal approximation theorem for convolutional networks in the limit of
continuous signals on euclidean spaces. Finally, we consider 2D signal
transformations equivariant with respect to the group SE(2) of rigid euclidean
motions. In this case we introduce the ""charge--conserving convnet"" -- a
convnet-like computational model based on the decomposition of the feature
space into isotypic representations of SO(2). We prove this model to be a
universal approximator for continuous SE(2)--equivariant signal

problems to average-case problems. There exist complexity classes such as
PSPACE that admit worst-case to average-case reductions. However, for many
other classes such as NP, the evidence so far is typically negative, in the
sense that the existence of such reductions would cause collapses of the
polynomial hierarchy(PH). Basing cryptographic primitives, e.g., the
average-case hardness of inverting one-way permutations, on NP-completeness is
a particularly intriguing instance. As there is evidence showing that classical
reductions from NP-hard problems to breaking these primitives result in PH
collapses, it seems unlikely to base cryptographic primitives on NP-hard
problems. Nevertheless, these results do not rule out the possibilities of the
existence of quantum reductions. In this work, we initiate a study of the
quantum analogues of these questions. Aside from formalizing basic notions of
quantum reductions and demonstrating powers of quantum reductions by examples
of separations, our main result shows that if NP-complete problems reduce to
inverting one-way permutations using certain types of quantum reductions, then
coNP $\subseteq$ QIP(2).

of such concentrated governance systems from rudimentary beginnings. Is the
emergence of integrated governance schemes a symptom of consolidation of
authority by small status groups? Or does integration occur because a complex
institution has more potential responses to a complex environment? Here we
examine the emergence of complex governance regimes in 5,000 sovereign,
resource-constrained, self-governing online communities, ranging in scale from
one to thousands of users. Each community begins with no community members and
no governance infrastructure. As communities grow, they are subject to
selection pressures that keep better managed servers better populated. We
identify predictors of community success and test the hypothesis that
governance complexity can enhance community fitness. We find that what predicts
success depends on size: changes in complexity predict increased success with
larger population servers. Specifically, governance rules in a large successful
community are more numerous and broader in scope. They also tend to rely more
on rules that concentrate power in administrators, and on rules that manage bad
behavior and limited server resources. Overall, this work is consistent with
theories that formal integrated governance systems emerge to organize
collective responses to interdependent resource management problems, especially
as factors such as population size exacerbate those problems.

dynamics pose both theoretical and practical challenges to statistical machine
learning algorithms that aim to accurately capture the complexities governing
the evolution of such processes. Typically the nonstationary dynamics are
modeled using nonstationary Gaussian Process models (NGPS) that employ local
latent dynamics parameterization to correspondingly model the nonstationary
real observable dynamics. Recently, an approach based on most likely induced
latent dynamics representation attracted research community's attention for a
while. The approach could not be employed for large scale real world
applications because learning a most likely latent dynamics representation
involves maximization of marginal likelihood of the observed real dynamics that
becomes intractable as the number of induced latent points grows with problem
size. We have established a direct relationship between informativeness of the
induced latent dynamics and the marginal likelihood of the observed real
dynamics. This opens up the possibility of maximizing marginal likelihood of
observed real dynamics indirectly by near optimally maximizing entropy or
mutual information gain on the induced latent dynamics using greedy algorithms.
Therefore, for an efficient yet accurate inference, we propose to build an
induced latent dynamics representation using a novel algorithm LISAL that
adaptively maximizes entropy or mutual information on the induced latent
dynamics and marginal likelihood of observed real dynamics in an iterative
manner. The relevance of LISAL is validated using real world datasets.

short block lengths, it is shown that near-ML performance can indeed be
achieved in many cases. We also propose a method to tailor the PC matrix to the

wavenumber multiplication on a set of spectral coefficients. After transforming

particular regularity condition at the origin. These regularity spaces have
remarkably simple properties under standard vector-calculus operations, such as
\textit{grad} and \textit{div}. We use a hierarchy of rescaled Jacobi

inverse-square potential, $V = - g/r^2$. This system is known to realize scale
invariance in a nontrivial way and to be subject to ambiguities associated with
the choice of boundary condition at the origin, often termed the problem of
`fall to the center'. Point-particle effective field theory (PPEFT) provides a
systematic framework for determining the boundary condition in terms of the
properties of the source residing at the origin. We apply this formalism to the
charged-wire/polarizable-atom problem, finding a result that is not a
self-adjoint extension because of absorption of atoms by the wire. We explore
the RG flow of the complex coupling constant for the dominant low-energy
effective interactions, finding flows whose character is qualitatively
different when $g$ is above or below a critical value, $g_c$. Unlike the
self-adjoint case, (complex) fixed points exist when $g> g_c$, which we show
correspond to perfect absorber (or perfect emitter) boundary conditions. We
describe experimental consequences for wire-atom interactions and the
possibility of observing the anomalous breaking of scale invariance.

transforming healthy speech to dysarthric speech using adversarial training. We
evaluate the efficacy of our approach using both objective and subjective
criteria. We present the transformed samples to five experienced
speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and ask them to identify the samples as
healthy or dysarthric. The results reveal that the SLPs identify the
transformed speech as dysarthric 65% of the time. In a pilot classification

existing dataset, the classification accuracy improves by about 10% after data
augmentation.

systems to perform massive matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication
operations that need to be parallelized across multiple nodes. The presence of
straggling nodes -- computing nodes that unpredictably slowdown or fail -- is a
major bottleneck in such distributed computations. Ideal load balancing
strategies that dynamically allocate more tasks to faster nodes require
knowledge or monitoring of node speeds as well as the ability to quickly move

unpredictable node slowdown, but they ignore partial work done by straggling
nodes thus resulting in a lot of redundant computation. We propose a
\emph{rateless fountain coding} strategy that achieves the best of both worlds

create linear combinations of the $m$ rows of the matrix and assign these

be decoded as soon as slightly more than $m$ row-vector products are

range of important applications such as vehicular communications and wireless
virtual/augmented reality. Realizing this in practice, though, requires
overcoming several challenges. First, the use of narrow beams and the
sensitivity of mmWave signals to blockage greatly impact the coverage and
reliability of highly-mobile links. Second, highly-mobile users in dense mmWave
deployments need to frequently hand-off between base stations (BSs), which is
associated with critical control and latency overhead. Further, identifying the
optimal beamforming vectors in large antenna array mmWave systems requires
considerable training overhead, which significantly affects the efficiency of
these mobile systems. In this paper, a novel integrated machine learning and
coordinated beamforming solution is developed to overcome these challenges and
enable highly-mobile mmWave applications. In the proposed solution, a number of
distributed yet coordinating BSs simultaneously serve a mobile user. This user
ideally needs to transmit only one uplink training pilot sequence that will be
jointly received at the coordinating BSs using omni or quasi-omni beam
patterns. These received signals draw a defining signature not only for the
user location, but also for its interaction with the surrounding environment.
The developed solution then leverages a deep learning model that learns how to
use these signatures to predict the beamforming vectors at the BSs. This
renders a comprehensive solution that supports highly-mobile mmWave
applications with reliable coverage, low latency, and negligible training
overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed deep-learning coordinated
beamforming strategy approaches the achievable rate of the genie-aided solution
that knows the optimal beamforming vectors with no training overhead.

joint policy and the closed-form expression of the minimum average transmission
rate. Accordingly, we analyze the tradeoff among communication, computing and

can be traded by the computing and caching capabilities of mobile VR device,

optimization problem in a heterogeneous scenario, and propose an efficient
suboptimal algorithm with low computation complexity, which is shown to achieve
good performance in the numerical results.

Therefore, it allows the dark-bright soliton to oscillate. The fixed local

The interaction of the dark-bright soliton with a delta function potential

more and more examples of such equations appear in interesting and important
applications. Thus, it is essential to be able to recognize these equations, to
be able to identify their type, and to see where they belong in the
classification scheme. The definite classification scheme for dP equations was
proposed by H. Sakai, who used geometric ideas to identify 22 different classes
of these equations. However, in a major contrast with the theory of ordinary
differential Painlev\'e equations, there are infinitely many non-equivalent
discrete equations in each class. Thus, there is no general form for a dP
equation in each class, although some nice canonical examples in each equation
class are known. The main objective of this paper is to illustrate that, in
addition to providing the classification scheme, the geometric ideas of Sakai
give us a powerful tool to study dP equations. We consider a very complicated
example of a dP equation that describes a simple Schlesinger transformation of
a Fuchsian system and we show how this equation can be identified with a much
simpler canonical example of the dP equation of the same type and moreover, we
give an explicit change of coordinates transforming one equation into the

output. But for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks, a network
must provide higher-resolution pixel-level outputs. To globalize information
while preserving resolution, many researchers propose the inclusion of
sophisticated auxiliary blocks, but these come at the cost of a considerable
increase in network size and computational cost. This paper proposes stacked
u-nets (SUNets), which iteratively combine features from different resolution
scales while maintaining resolution. SUNets leverage the information
globalization power of u-nets in a deeper network architectures that is capable
of handling the complexity of natural images. SUNets perform extremely well on
semantic segmentation tasks using a small number of parameters.

has been the central piece of research in social and information network
analysis for the last couple of years. An information network can be viewed as
a linked structure of a set of entities. A set of linked web pages and
documents, a set of users in a social network are common examples of
information network. Network embedding learns low dimensional representations
of the nodes, which can further be used for downstream network mining
applications such as community detection or node clustering. Information
network representation techniques traditionally use only the link structure of
the network. But in real world networks, nodes come with additional content
such as textual descriptions or associated images. This content is semantically
correlated with the network structure and hence using the content along with
the topological structure of the network can facilitate the overall network
representation. In this paper, we propose Sac2Vec, a network representation
technique that exploits both the structure and content. We convert the network
into a multi-layered graph and use random walk and language modeling technique
to generate the embedding of the nodes. Our approach is simple and
computationally fast, yet able to use the content as a complement to structure
and vice-versa. We also generalize the approach for networks having multiple
types of content in each node. Experimental evaluations on four real world
publicly available datasets show the merit of our approach compared to

credibility (probability of any given true parameter residing in the region)
are known, which form the two principal region properties to be reported
alongside a point estimator obtained from collected data. We first establish
analytical formulas for the size and credibility that are valid for a uniform
prior distribution over parameters, sufficiently large data samples and general
constrained convex parameter-estimation settings. These formulas provide a
means to an efficient asymptotic error certification for parameters of
arbitrary dimensions. Next, we demonstrate the accuracies of these analytical
formulas as compared to numerically computed region quantities with simulated
examples in qubit and qutrit quantum-state tomography where computations of the
latter are feasible.

introduce the concept of region accuracy for error regions (a generalization of
the point-estimator mean squared-error) to quantify the average statistical
accuracy of all region points with respect to the unknown true parameter. We
show that the increase in region accuracy is closely related to the
Bayesian-region dual operations in [1]. Next with only the given dataset as
viable evidence, we establish various adaptive methods to maximize the region
accuracy relative to the true parameter subject to the type of reported
Bayesian region for a given point estimator. We highlight the performance of
these adaptive methods by comparing them with nonadaptive procedures in three
quantum-parameter estimation examples. The results of and mechanisms behind the
adaptive schemes can be understood as the region analog of adaptive approaches
to achieving the quantum Cramer--Rao bound for point estimators.

between the dynamics of divergence free vector fields on an oriented
3-dimensional manifold $M$ and the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. It is shown
that for a given divergence free vector field $X$ with a global cross-section
there exist some 4-dimensional symplectic manifold $\tilde{M}\supset M$ and a
smooth Hamilton function $H: \tilde{M}\to \mathbb R$ such that for some $c\in
\mathbb R$ one gets $M = \{H=c\}$ and the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$
restricted on this level coincides with $X$. For divergence free vector fields
with singular points such the extension is impossible but the existence of
local cross-section allows one to reduce the dynamics to the study of
symplectic diffeomorphisms in some sub-domains of $M$. We also consider the
case of a divergence free vector field $X$ with a smooth integral having only
finite number of critical levels. It is shown that such a noncritical level is
always a 2-torus and restriction of $X$ on it possesses a smooth invariant
2-form. The linearization of the flow on such a torus (i.e. the reduction to
the constant vector field) is not always possible in contrast to the case of an
integrable Hamiltonian system but in the analytic case ($M$ and $X$ are real
analytic), due to the Kolmogorov theorem, such the linearization is possible
for tori with Diophantine rotation numbers.

$(Q,U)\equiv(Q_E, U_E)+(Q_B,U_B)$. This also enables an investigation of the

less across the sky than that of the B family, and the same tendency occurs for
the polarization angles of the dust and synchrotron channels. The new insight

contains 262 spiral and 155 S0 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. We have classified bulges into classical and pseudobulge categories
based on their position on the Kormendy diagram. Dividing our sample into bins
of galaxy stellar mass, we find that the fraction of S0 galaxies hosting a
classical bulge is significantly higher than the classical bulge fraction seen
in spirals even at fixed stellar mass. We have compared the bulge and the
global properties of spirals and S0 galaxies in our sample and find indications
that spiral galaxies which host a classical bulge, preferentially get converted
into S0 population as compared to pseudobulge hosting spirals. By studying the
star formation properties of our galaxies in the NUV-r color-mass diagram, we
find that the pseudobulge hosting spirals are mostly star forming while the
majority of classical bulge host spirals are in the green valley or in the
passive sequence. We suggest that some internal process, such as AGN feedback
or morphological quenching due to the massive bulge, quenches these classical
bulge hosting spirals and transforms them into S0 galaxies, thus resulting in
the observed predominance of the classical bulge in S0 galaxies.

formation theory predicts that stars form even with a high value of $\Lambda /

Here we calculate the probability distribution of $\Lambda$ using a model of
cosmological galaxy formation, considering extinction of observers caused by
radiation from nearby supernovae. The life survival probability decreases in a
large $\Lambda$ universe because of higher stellar density. Using a reasonable
rate of lethal supernovae, we find that the mean expectation value of $\Lambda$
can be close to $\Lambda_{\rm obs}$, and hence this effect may be essential to
understand the small but nonzero value of $\Lambda$. It is predicted that we

underlying physical mechanism of strain-dependent magnetic stability is mainly
attributed to the competition effect of direct AFM interaction and indirect FM

estimators with an exactly known bias. Conditions under which its statistical
performance are improved by the other estimation procedures when the exact bias
is not known are found and analyzed. Using simulations and analysis of
experimental data, it is shown that both moment-based and
maximum-likelihood-based estimators provide better results, when the noise
standard deviation is comparable with the quantization step and the noise model
of quantization can not be applied.

  Approach",,,,,"cs.CR cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Open-access blockchains based on proof-of-work protocols have gained
tremendous popularity for their capabilities of providing decentralized
tamper-proof ledgers and platforms for data-driven autonomous organization.
Nevertheless, the proof-of-work based consensus protocols are vulnerable to
cyber-attacks such as double-spending. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach of cyber risk management for blockchain-based service. In particular,
we adopt the cyber-insurance as an economic tool for neutralizing cyber risks
due to attacks in blockchain networks. We consider a blockchain service market,
which is composed of the infrastructure provider, the blockchain provider, the
cyber-insurer, and the users. The blockchain provider purchases from the
infrastructure provider, e.g., a cloud, the computing resources to maintain the
blockchain consensus, and then offers blockchain services to the users. The
blockchain provider strategizes its investment in the infrastructure and the
service price charged to the users, in order to improve the security of the
blockchain and thus optimize its profit. Meanwhile, the blockchain provider
also purchases a cyber-insurance from the cyber-insurer to protect itself from
the potential damage due to the attacks. In return, the cyber-insurer adjusts
the insurance premium according to the perceived risk level of the blockchain
service. Based on the assumption of rationality for the market entities, we
model the interaction among the blockchain provider, the users, and the
cyber-insurer as a two-level Stackelberg game. Namely, the blockchain provider
and the cyber-insurer lead to set their pricing/investment strategies, and then
the users follow to determine their demand of the blockchain service.
Specifically, we consider the scenario of double-spending attacks and provide a
series of analytical results about the Stackelberg equilibrium in the market
game.

simultaneously by the analytic expression and numerical integration. The
maximum deviation of this two results is always less than 25% and the mean

description of the energy exchange between the binary. It indicates that the
energy change depends on the hyperbolic shape of the binary orbit with respect
to the planet, the masses of planet and the primary member of the binary, the
binary phase at perigee. We can illustrate the capture/escape processes and
give the capture/escape region of the binary clearly by numerical simulation.

a subset of servers to serve user tasks while satisfying delay requirements of

scheduling at mobile devices, server selection to serve user offloading tasks,
and task allocations to the selected servers. To this end, we first formulate
the problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming, due to the hardness to

experimental results and theoretical models and ideas of the last years in the
field of nuclear fission. New experimental approaches extended the availability
of fissioning systems considerably and provided a full identification of all
fission products in A and Z for the first time. In particular, the transition
from symmetric to asymmetric fission around 226Th and some unexpected structure
in the mass distributions in the fission of systems around Z = 80 to 84 as well
as an extended systematics of the odd-even effect in fission fragment Z
distributions have been measured [A. N. Andreyev et al., Rep. Progr. Phys. 81
(2018) 016301]. Three classes of theoretical descriptions of fission presently
appear to be the most promising or the most successful ones: Self-consistent
quantum-mechanical models fully consider the quantum-mechanical features of the
fission process. Intense efforts are presently made to develop suitable
theoretical tools [N. Schunck, L. M. Robledo, Rep. Prog. Phys. 79 (2016)
116301] for modeling the non-equilibrium, large-amplitude collective motion
leading to fission. Stochastic, essentially classical models provide a fully
developed technical framework. The main features of the fission-fragment mass
distribution are well reproduced from mercury to fermium and beyond [P.
M\""oller, J. Randrup, Phys. Rev. C 91 (2015) 044316]. In an alternative
semi-empirical approach [K.-H. Schmidt et al., Nucl. Data Sheets 131 (2016)
107], considerable progress in describing the fission observables has been
achieved by combining several general theoretical concepts. This new approach
reveals a high degree of regularity and allows calculating high-quality data
with a unique parameter set for a large number of systems and an extended
excitation-energy range.

carried out with the Doppler reflectometry system in the TJ-II stellarator. The
study focuses on the fact that, under some conditions, the radial electric
field measured at different points over the same flux surface shows
significantly different values. A numerical analysis is carried out considering
the contribution arising from the radial dependence of $\Phi_1$ as a possible
correction term to the total radial electric field. Here $\Phi_1$ is the
neoclassical electrostatic potential variation over the surface. The comparison
shows good agreement in some aspects, like the conditions under which this
correction is large (electron-root conditions) or negligible (ion-root
conditions). But it disagrees in others like the sign of the correction. The
results are discussed together with the underlying reasons of this partial
disagreement. In addition, motivated by the recent installation of the dual
Doppler reflectometry system in Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), $\Phi_1$ estimations
for W7-X are revisited considering Core-Electron-Root-Plasma (CERC) plasmas
from its first experimental campaign. The simulations show larger values of
$\Phi_1$ under electron-root conditions than under ion root ones. The
contribution from the kinetic electron response is shown to become important at
some radii. All this results in a potential variation size noticeably larger
than estimated in our previous work in W7-X \cite{Regana_nf_57_056004_2017} for
other plasma parameters and another configuration.

label-rich domain (source) to a label-scarce domain (target). Almost all of
them are proposed for a closed-set scenario, where the source and the target
domain completely share the class of their samples. We call the shared class
the \doublequote{known class.} However, in practice, when samples in target
domain are not labeled, we cannot know whether the domains share the class. A
target domain can contain samples of classes that are not shared by the source

that work well in the open set situation are very practical. However, most
existing distribution matching methods for domain adaptation do not work well
in this setting because unknown target samples should not be aligned with the

  In this paper, we propose a method for an open set domain adaptation scenario
which utilizes adversarial training. A classifier is trained to make a boundary
between the source and the target samples whereas a generator is trained to
make target samples far from the boundary. Thus, we assign two options to the
feature generator: aligning them with source known samples or rejecting them as
unknown target samples. This approach allows extracting features that separate
unknown target samples from known target samples. Our method was extensively
evaluated in domain adaptation setting and outperformed other methods with a
large margin in most settings.

portability between different production plants. Unlike this, we propose a
declarative approach based on Answer Set Programming to optimize the routes
taken by automated guided vehicles for accomplishing transport tasks. The
advantages include a transparent and executable problem formalization, provable
optimality of routes relative to objective criteria, as well as elaboration
tolerance towards particular factory layouts and production targets. Moreover,

physical layer rateless codes with constant transmit power and the other uses
fixed-rate codes in conjunction with power adaptation. Using a simple
stochastic geometry model for the cellular downlink, the focus is to compare
the adaptivity of fixed-rate codes with power adaptation to that of physical
layer rateless codes only. The performance of both rateless and fixed-rate
coded adaptive transmission schemes are compared by evaluating the typical user
success probability and rate achievable with the two schemes. Based on both the

fixed-rate codes require power control to maintain good performance whereas

estimation approaches and their ability to generalize to unseen environments,
multi-view (MV) approaches are often lagging behind in terms of accuracy and
are specific to certain datasets. This is mainly due to the fact that (1)
contrary to real world single-view (SV) datasets, MV datasets are often
captured in controlled environments to collect precise 3D annotations, which do
not cover all real world challenges, and (2) the model parameters are learned
for specific camera setups. To alleviate these problems, we propose a two-stage
approach to detect and estimate 3D human poses, which separates SV pose
detection from MV 3D pose estimation. This separation enables us to utilize
each dataset for the right task, i.e. SV datasets for constructing robust pose
detection models and MV datasets for constructing precise MV 3D regression
models. In addition, our 3D regression approach only requires 3D pose data and
its projections to the views for building the model, hence removing the need
for collecting annotated data from the test setup. Our approach can therefore
be easily generalized to a new environment by simply projecting 3D poses into
2D during training according to the camera setup used at test time. As 2D poses
are collected at test time using a SV pose detector, which might generate
inaccurate detections, we model its characteristics and incorporate this
information during training. We demonstrate that incorporating the detector's
characteristics is important to build a robust 3D regression model and that the
resulting regression model generalizes well to new MV environments. Our
evaluation results show that our approach achieves competitive results on the
Human3.6M dataset and significantly improves results on a MV clinical dataset
that is the first MV dataset generated from live surgery recordings.

present, i.e., we cannot affirm that there is no AGN when the source is not
detected. For this reason, the number of identified AGN using VLBI should be
always treated as a lower limit. We present a catalogue containing the 35 radio
sources detected with the VLBA+GBT, 10 of which were not previously detected
using only the VLBA. We have constructed the radio source counts at 1.4 GHz
using the samples of the VLBA and VLBA+GBT detected sources of the COSMOS field
to determine a lower limit for the AGN contribution to the faint radio source
population. We found an AGN contribution of >40-75% at flux density levels
between 150 $\mu$Jy and 1 mJy. This flux density range is characterised by the
upturn of the Euclidean-normalised radio source counts, which implies a
contribution of a new population. This result supports the idea that the
sub-mJy radio population is composed of a significant fraction of
radio-emitting AGN, rather than solely by star-forming galaxies, in agreement
with previous studies.

Markovian, context-dependent motion models to define the interaction-aware

estimated over time by tracking the single agents via sequential Monte Carlo
inference. Secondly, we perform a probabilistic forward simulation of the
network's estimated belief state to generate the different combinatorial scene
developments. This provides the corresponding trajectories for the set of
possible, future scenes. Our framework can handle various road layouts and

operators. The model consists of the five parameters: the lightest neutrino
mass $m_1$, the vacuum expectation value of $\eta$ and three CP violating
phases after inputting the experimental values of $\Delta m_{\rm atm}^2$ and
$\Delta m_{\rm sol}^2$. The model with the $1""$ singlet flavon gives the
prediction of $\sin^2 \theta_{12}$ around the best fit of NuFIT 3.2 while
keeping near the maximal mixing of $\theta_{23}$. Inputting the experimental
mixing angles with the $1\,\sigma$ error-bar, the Dirac CP violating phase is
clearly predicted to be $|\delta_\text{CP}|=50^\circ- 120^\circ$, which will be
tested by the precise observed value in the future. In order to get the best
fit value $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.538$, the sum of three neutrino masses is
predicted to be larger than $90\,$meV. The cosmological observation for the sum

  In this paper we show that these problems, and also other problems of similar

coloring, in which the sets (multisets, resp.) of colors, that appear on every
pair of intersecting edges are different. We show upper bounds on the size of
lists, which guarantee the existence of an ieds- or iedm-coloring, respecting
these lists. The proof is essentially a randomized algorithm, whose expected
time complexity is polynomial. As corollaries, we derive new results concerning
the list variants of graph labeling problems, distinguishing neighbors by sets

for different, related problems.
  We also investigate a close connection between edge labelings of bipartite

distribution of Co56. On the other hand, the 511 keV line arises from the
annihilation of positions, which are also produced by the Co56 decay but can
propagate through the ejecta before they slow down and annihilate. Therefore,
the shape of the annihilation line might differ from other gamma-ray lines,
providing constraints on the efficiency of positrons propagation through the

location variation, segmenting the objects from different medical imaging
modalities (e.g., CT, MR) is considered as an important yet challenging task.
In this paper, we present a novel method for interactive medical image
segmentation with the following merits. (1) Our design is fundamentally
different from previous pure patch-based and image-based segmentation methods.
We observe that during delineation, the physician repeatedly check the
inside-outside intensity changing to determine the boundary, which indicates
that comparison in an inside-outside manner is extremely important. Thus, we
innovatively model our segmentation task as learning the representation of the
bi-directional sequential patches, starting from (or ending in) the given
central point of the object. This can be realized by our proposed ConvRNN
network embedded with a gated memory propagation unit. (2) Unlike previous
interactive methods (requiring bounding box or seed points), we only ask the
physician to merely click on the rough central point of the object before
segmentation, which could simultaneously enhance the performance and reduce the
segmentation time. (3) We utilize our method in a multi-level framework for
better performance. We systematically evaluate our method in three different
segmentation tasks including CT kidney tumor, MR prostate, and PROMISE12
challenge, showing promising results compared with state-of-the-art methods.

also describe the global appearance from either horizontal or vertical

horizontal sub-model and vertical sub-model) in a cascaded manner, to integrate
the segmentation results from two directions (i.e., horizontal and vertical).
This cascaded training strategy could effectively guarantee the consistency
between sub-models, by feeding each other with the most difficult samples, for
a better segmentation. In the experiment, we evaluate our method on a real CT
kidney tumor dataset, collected from 94 different patients including 3,500
images. Compared with the state-of-the-art segmentation methods, the results
demonstrate the superior results of our method on dice ratio score, true
positive fraction, centroid distance and Hausdorff distance. Moreover, we have
extended our crossbar-net to a different task: cardiac segmentation, showing
the promising results for the better generalization.

density profile of the discs shows {two breaks at $R\sim11$ and $\sim14$\,kpc,

different scale lengths of $2.12\pm0.26$, $1.18\pm0.08$, and $2.72$\,kpc at

likely due to the sudden drop in the radial profile of the thin disc, which may
be an evidence of the radial migration. {Beyond $14$\,kpc, the thick disc
becomes prominent and the transition from thin to thick disc leads to the
second break.} This implies that the geometrically defined thick disc is more
{radially} extended than the thin disc. This is also supported by the larger
scale length of the thick disc than that of the thin disc. Meanwhile, {the
scale height of the thicker component increases from $0.637_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$

the stellar density. Among them, the substructures $D14+2.0$ and $O14-1.5$ show
a north-south asymmetry, which can be essentially explained by southward
shifting of the thick disc. However, no significant overdensity is found for
the Monoceros ring. Finally, the thick disc shows a ripple-like feature with

We consider the so-called $\alpha$-attractor models in two formulations of

and in the Palatini formulation where $R_{\mu\nu}$ is an independent variable.
As the main result, we show that, regardless of the underlying theory of
gravity, the field-space curvature in the Einstein frame has no influence on
the inflationary dynamics at the limit of large $\xi_I$, and one effectively
retains the single-field case. However, the gravity formulation does play an
important role: in the metric case the result means that multifield models
approach the single-field $\alpha$-attractor limit, whereas in the Palatini
case the attractor behaviour is lost also in the case of multifield inflation.
We discuss what this means for distinguishing between different models of

cells (LCs). To understand why different forms of LL/lymphoma occur at
different ages, we analyzed the effects of different types of DNA changes on a
LC and the cellular characteristics of LCs. Point DNA mutations (PDMs) and
chromosome changes (CCs) are the two major types of DNA changes. CCs have three
subtypes by their effects on a LC: great-effect CCs (GECCs), mild-effect CCs
(MECCs), and intermediate-effect CCs (IECCs). PDMs and MECCs are mostly mild
thus can accumulate in cells. Some of the PDMs/MECCs contribute to cell
transformation. A GECC affects one or more genes and can alone drive cell
transformation. An IECC affects one or more genes and participates in cell
transformation. Due to cellular characteristics, a LC may have higher
survivability from DNA changes and require obtaining fewer cancerous properties
for transformation than a tissue cell. Hence, a LC can be more rapidly
transformed by a CC. On this basis, we hypothesize that a LC may have three
pathways on transformation: a slow, a rapid, and an accelerated. Slow pathway
is driven by accumulation of PDMs/MECCs. Rapid pathway is driven by a GECC in
""one step"". Accelerated pathway is driven by accumulation of
PDMs/MECCs/IECC(s). Cell transformations of a LC via different pathways occur
at different ages. A transformation via slow pathway occurs mainly in adults. A
transformation via rapid pathway occurs at any age and has no increasing
incidence with age. A transformation via accelerated pathway occurs also at any
age but has increasing incidence with age. In conclusion, a LC may have three
pathways on cell transformation, and the occurring age of LL/lymphoma may be
determined by the transforming pathway of a LC.

evidence can be interpreted in a way that suggests consciousness is a product
of the organization of energetic activity in the brain. The nature of energy
itself, though, remains largely mysterious, and we do not fully understand how
it contributes to brain function or consciousness. According to the principle
outlined here, energy, along with forces and work, can be described as
actualized differences of motion and tension. By observing physical systems, we
can infer there is something it is like to undergo actualized difference from
the intrinsic perspective of the system. Consciousness occurs because there is
something it is like, intrinsically, to undergo a certain organization of
actualized differences in the brain.

Markov in general. We modify it to build the Markov process we call

that Law(Yn) = $\mu$n is given by the data of its couplings from n to n + 1,

having those couplings as transitions. Therefore, there is a canonical Markov
process with marginals $\mu$n and as similar as possible to the quantile
process: the chain whose transitions are the quantile couplings. We show that
an analogous process exists for a continuous parameter t: there is a unique
Markov process X with the measures $\mu$t as marginals, and being a limit for
the finite dimensional topology of quantile processes where the past is made
independent of the future at finitely many times (many non-Markovian limits
exist in general). The striking fact is that the construction requires no
regularity for the family $\mu$. We rely on order arguments, which seems to be
completely new for the purpose.We also prove new results the Markov-quantile
process yields in two contemporary frameworks:-- In case $\mu$ is increasing
for the stochastic order, X has increasing trajectories. This is an analogue of
a result of Kellerer dealing with the convex order, peacocks and martingales.
Modifiying Kellerer's proof, we also prove simultaneously his result and ours
in this case.-- If $\mu$ is absolutely continuous in Wasserstein space P2(R)
then X is solution of a Benamou--Brenier transport problem with marginals
$\mu$t. Itprovides a Markov probabilistic representation of the continuity

The existence of bulk spontaneous modulated or deformed nematic liquid crystal

needed to ensure the nonlinear (and sometimes non-inner-product) strong
stability properties of spatial discretizations specially designed for the
solution of hyperbolic PDEs. Multiderivative time-stepping methods have
recently been increasingly used for evolving hyperbolic PDEs, and the strong
stability properties of these methods are of interest. In our prior work we
explored time discretizations that preserve the strong stability properties of
spatial discretizations coupled with forward Euler and a second derivative
formulation. However, many spatial discretizations do not satisfy strong
stability properties when coupled with this second derivative formulation, but
rather with a more natural Taylor series formulation. In this work we
demonstrate sufficient conditions for an explicit two-derivative multistage
method to preserve the strong stability properties of spatial discretizations
in a forward Euler and Taylor series formulation. We call these strong
stability preserving Taylor series (SSP-TS) methods. We also prove that the
maximal order of SSP-TS methods is p = 6, and define an optimization procedure
that allows us to find such SSP methods. Several types of these methods are
presented and their efficiency compared. Finally, these methods are tested on
several PDEs to demonstrate the benefit of SSP-TS methods, the need for the SSP
property, and the sharpness of the SSP time-step in many cases.

modeled by considering these parameters as random, and described by marginal

dependence structure itself. Faced with this problem of incomplete or missing
information, risk studies are often conducted by considering independence of
input variables, at the risk of including irrelevant situations. This approach
is especially used when reliability functions are considered as black-box
computational models. Such analyses remain weakened in absence of in-depth
model exploration, at the possible price of a strong risk misestimation.
Considering the frequent case where the reliability output is a quantile, this
article provides a methodology to improve risk assessment, by exploring a set
of pessimistic dependencies using a copula-based strategy. In dimension greater
than two, a greedy algorithm is provided to build input regular vine copulas
reaching a minimum quantile to which a reliability admissible limit value can
be compared, by selecting pairwise components of sensitive influence on the

combination of $c$-axis magnetic field and in-plane uniaxial stress. In
unstressed \CAS{} there are two magnetic phases. The low-field A phase is a
single-component spin-density wave (SDW), with $\mathbf{q} = (\eta, \pm \eta,
1/2)$, and the high-field B phase consists of microscopically coexisting
$(\eta, \eta, 1/2)$ and $(\eta, -\eta, 1/2)$ spin-density waves. Pressure along
a $\langle 100 \rangle$ lattice direction is a transverse field to both of
these phases, and so initially has little effect, however eventually induces
new low- and high-field phases in which the principal axes of the SDW
components appear to have rotated to the $\langle 100 \rangle$ directions.
Under this strong $\langle 100 \rangle$ compression, the field evolution of the
resistivity is much smoother than at zero strain: In zero strain, there is a
strong first-order transition, while under strong $\langle 100 \rangle$ it
becomes much broader. We hypothesize that this is a consequence of the uniaxial
stress lifting the degeneracy between the (100) and (010) directions.

calculus and the theory of embedded graphs (or ""maps""), this paper develops an
analogy between typing (of lambda terms) and coloring (of maps). Our starting
point is the classical notion of an abelian group-valued ""flow"" on an abstract
graph (Tutte, 1954). Typing a linear lambda term may be naturally seen as
constructing a flow (on an embedded 3-valent graph with boundary) valued in a
more general algebraic structure consisting of a preordered set equipped with
an ""implication"" operation and unit satisfying composition, identity, and unit
laws. Interesting questions and results from the theory of flows (such as the
existence of nowhere-zero flows) may then be re-examined from the standpoint of
lambda calculus and logic. For example, we give a characterization of when the
local flow relations (across vertices) may be categorically lifted to a global
flow relation (across the boundary), proving that this holds just in case the
underlying map has the orientation of a lambda term. We also develop a basic
theory of rewriting of flows that suggests topological meanings for classical
completeness results in combinatory logic, and introduce a polarized notion of
flow, which draws connections to the theory of proof-nets in linear logic and
to bidirectional typing.

  (SISC)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a novel computational approach to fast and memory-efficient
deformable image registration. In the variational registration model, the
computation of the objective function derivatives is the computationally most
expensive operation, both in terms of runtime and memory requirements. In order
to target this bottleneck, we analyze the matrix structure of gradient and
Hessian computations for the case of the normalized gradient fields distance
measure and curvature regularization. Based on this analysis, we derive
equivalent matrix-free closed-form expressions for derivative computations,
eliminating the need for storing intermediate results and the costs of sparse
matrix arithmetic. This has further benefits: (1) matrix computations can be
fully parallelized, (2) memory complexity for derivative computation is reduced
from linear to constant, and (3) overall computation times are substantially
reduced.
  In comparison with an optimized matrix-based reference implementation, the
CPU implementation achieves speedup factors between 3.1 and 9.7, and we are
able to handle substantially higher resolutions. Using a GPU implementation, we
achieve an additional speedup factor of up to 9.2.
  Furthermore, we evaluated the approach on real-world medical datasets. On ten
publicly available lung CT images from the DIR-Lab 4DCT dataset, we achieve the
best mean landmark error of 0.93 mm compared to other submissions on the
DIR-Lab website, with an average runtime of only 9.23 s. Complete non-rigid
registration of full-size 3D thorax-abdomen CT volumes from oncological
follow-up is achieved in 12.6 s. The experimental results show that the
proposed matrix-free algorithm enables the use of variational registration
models also in applications which were previously impractical due to memory or
runtime restrictions.

in the low-dimensional hyper-parameters space of the GP and adapted across time
using Sequential Monte Carlo methods. Each robot samples a belief point from
the GM and locally optimizes a set of informative regions by greedy
maximization of the submodular entropy function. The key contributions of this
paper are threefold: adapting the belief on the covariance using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling such that particles survive even under sharp
covariance changes across time; exploiting the belief to transform the problem
of entropy maximization into a decentralized one; and developing an
approximation algorithm to maximize entropy on a set of informative regions in
the continuous space. We illustrate the application of the proposed solution
through extensive simulations using an artificial dataset and multiple real

energy-conserving method suffers from a loss of accuracy compared to an
approach which requires to solve a full nonlinear problem in each time-step. In
order to obtain a representative comparison, our numerical experiments cover
different physically relevant test cases, such as traveling solitons,
stationary multi-solitons, Bose-Einstein condensates in an optical lattice and
vortex pattern in a rapidly rotating superfluid. We shall also consider a
computationally severe test case involving a pseudo Mott insulator. Our space
discretization is based on finite elements throughout the paper. We will also
give special attention to long time behavior and possible coupling conditions
between time-step sizes and mesh sizes. The main observation of this paper is
that mass conservation alone will not lead to a competitive method in complex
settings. Furthermore, energy-conserving and symplectic methods are both
reliable and accurate, yet, the energy-conservative schemes achieve a visibly
higher accuracy in our test cases. Finally, the scheme that performs best
throughout our experiments is an energy-conserving relaxation scheme with

photons. The photons propagate along a transmission line and impinge on one of
the mirrors of a high-finesse cavity. The quantum memory is constituted by a
single atom within the optical resonator. Photon storage is realised by the
controlled transfer of the photonic excitation into a metastable state of the
atom and occurs via a Raman transition with a suitably tailored laser pulse,
which drives the atom. Our study is supported by numerical simulations, in
which we include the modes of the transmission line and we use the experimental
parameters of existing experimental setups. It reproduces the results derived
using input-output theory in the corresponding regime and can be extended to
compute dynamics where the input-output formalism cannot be straightforwardly
applied. Our analysis determines the maximal storage efficiency, namely, the
maximal probability to store the photon in a stable atomic excitation, in the
presence of spontaneous decay and cavity parasitic losses. It further delivers
the form of the laser pulse that achieves the maximal efficiency by partially
compensating parasitic losses. We numerically assess the conditions under which
storage based on adiabatic dynamics is preferable to non-adiabatic pulses.
Moreover, we systematically determine the shortest photon pulse that can be
efficiently stored as a function of the system parameters.

simulations of isolated binary galaxy collisions has been constructed to
investigate the dynamical friction timescales, $\tau_{\rm mer}$, for major
mergers. Our experiments follow the gravitational encounters between $\sim 600$
pairs of similarly massive late- and early-type galaxies with orbital
parameters compliant to the predictions of the LambdaCDM cosmology. We analyze
the performance of different schemes for tracking the secular evolution of
mergers, finding that the product of the intergalactic distance and velocity is
best suited to identify the time of coalescence. In contrast, a widely used
merger time estimator such as the exhaustion of the orbital spin is shown to
systematically underpredict $\tau_ {\rm mer}$, resulting in relative errors
that can reach 60% for nearly radial encounters. Regarding the internal spins
of the progenitors, we find that they can lead to total variations in the
merger times above 30% in highly circular encounters, whereas only that of the
principal halo is capable of modulating the strength of the interaction
prevailing throughout a merger. The comparison of our simulated merger times
with predictions from different variants of a well-known fitting formula has
revealed an only partially satisfactory agreement, which has led us to
recalculate the values of the coefficients of these expressions to obtain
relations that fit perfectly major mergers. The observed biases between data
and predictions, that do not only apply to the present work, are inconsistent
with expectations from differences in the degree of idealization of the
collisions, their metric, spin-related biases, or the simulation set-up. This
hints to a certain lack of accuracy of the dynamical friction modelling,
arising perhaps from a still not quite complete identification of the
parameters governing orbital decay.

because they provide a unique probe into the structure of coronal loops through
MHD seismology and a potential test of coronal heating through the phase-mixing
of Alfv\'en waves. In particular, recent observations show that standing
oscillations of loops often involve also higher harmonics, beside the
fundamental mode. The damping of these kink oscillations is explained by mode
coupling with Alfv\'en waves. We investigate the consequences for wave-based
coronal heating of higher harmonics and what coronal heating observational
signatures we may use to infer the presence of higher harmonic kink
oscillations. We perform a set of non-ideal MHD simulations where the damping
of the kink oscillation of a flux tube via mode coupling is modelled. Our MHD
simulation parameters are based on the seismological inversion of an
observation for which the first three harmonics are detected. We study the
phase-mixing of Alfv\'en waves that leads to the deposition of heat in the
system, and we apply the seismological inversion techniques to the MHD
simulation output. We find that the heating due to phase-mixing of the Alfv\'en
waves triggered by the damping of the kink oscillation is relatively small,
however we can illustrate i) how the heating location drifts due to the
subsequent damping of lower order harmonics. We also address the role of the
higher order harmonics and the width of the boundary shell in the energy
deposition. We conclude that the coronal heating due to phase-mixing seems not
to provide enough energy to maintain the thermal structure of the solar corona
even when multi-harmonics oscillations are included, and these oscillations
play an inhibiting role in the development of smaller scale structures.

generated from user applications and need to be processed in the datacenter.
Data-parallel computing frameworks, such as Apache Spark, are widely used to
perform such data processing at scale. Specifically, Spark leverages
distributed memory to cache the intermediate results, represented as Resilient
Distributed Datasets (RDDs). This gives Spark an advantage over other parallel
frameworks for implementations of iterative machine learning and data mining
algorithms, by avoiding repeated computation or hard disk accesses to retrieve
RDDs. By default, caching decisions are left at the programmer's discretion,
and the LRU policy is used for evicting RDDs when the cache is full. However,
when the objective is to minimize total work, LRU is woefully inadequate,
leading to arbitrarily suboptimal caching decisions. In this paper, we design
an algorithm for multi-stage big data processing platforms to adaptively
determine and cache the most valuable intermediate datasets that can be reused
in the future. Our solution automates the decision of which RDDs to cache: this
amounts to identifying nodes in a direct acyclic graph (DAG) representing
computations whose outputs should persist in the memory. Our experiment results
show that our proposed cache optimization solution can improve the performance
of machine learning applications on Spark decreasing the total work to
recompute RDDs by 12%.

Jupiter's main auroral emission close to noon by Palmaerts et al. (2014). We
use results from three-dimensional global MHD simulations to understand what is
causing this localized peak in the main emission. In the simulations, the peak
occurs every rotation period and is due to shearing motions in the magnetodisk.
These shearing motions are caused by heavy flux-tubes being accelerated to
large azimuthal speeds at dawn. The centrifugal force acting on these
flux-tubes is then so high that they rapidly move away from the planet. When
they reach noon, their azimuthal velocity decreases, thus reducing the
centrifugal force, and allowing the flux-tubes to move back closer to Jupiter.
The shearing motions associated with this periodic phenomenon locally increase
the field aligned currents in the simulations, thus causing a transient
brightness enhancement in the main auroral emission, similar to the one
observed by Palmaerts et al. (2014).

e.g., vehicle-to-everything communication and next-generation cellular
communication, frequent link configuration can be a source of significant
overhead. We use the sub-6 GHz channel covariance as an out-of-band side
information for mmWave link configuration. Assuming: (i) a fully digital
architecture at sub-6 GHz; and (ii) a hybrid analog-digital architecture at
mmWave, we propose an out-of-band covariance translation approach and an
out-of-band aided compressed covariance estimation approach. For covariance
translation, we estimate the parameters of sub-6 GHz covariance and use them in
theoretical expressions of covariance matrices to predict the mmWave
covariance. For out-of-band aided covariance estimation, we use weighted sparse
signal recovery to incorporate out-of-band information in compressed covariance
estimation. The out-of-band covariance translation eliminates the in-band
training completely, whereas out-of-band aided covariance estimation relies on
in-band as well as out-of-band training. We also analyze the loss in the
signal-to-noise ratio due to an imperfect estimate of the covariance. The
simulation results show that the proposed covariance estimation strategies can
reduce the training overhead compared to the in-band only covariance
estimation.

bivariate distributions', {\it American Statistician}, 221 - 230) proposed two
general classes of discrete bivariate distributions. They have discussed some
general properties and some specific cases of their proposed distributions. In
this paper we have considered one model, namely bivariate discrete Weibull
distribution, which has not been considered in the literature yet. The proposed
bivariate discrete Weibull distribution is a discrete analogue of the
Marshall-Olkin bivariate Weibull distribution. We study various properties of
the proposed distribution and discuss its interesting physical interpretations.
The proposed model has four parameters, and because of that it is a very
flexible distribution. The maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters
cannot be obtained in closed forms, and we have proposed a very efficient
nested EM algorithm which works quite well for discrete data. We have also
proposed augmented Gibbs sampling procedure to compute Bayes estimates of the
unknown parameters based on a very flexible set of priors. Two data sets have
been analyzed to show how the proposed model and the method work in practice.
We will see that the performances are quite satisfactory. Finally, we conclude
the paper.

dataset. Specifically, we show that it is possible to reconstruct high-SBP
dynamic cell videos by a CNN trained only on the first FPM dataset captured at
the beginning of a time-series experiment. Our CNN approach reconstructs a
12800X10800 pixels phase image using only ~25 seconds, a 50X speedup compared
to the model-based FPM algorithm. In addition, the CNN further reduces the
required number of images in each time frame by ~6X. Overall, this
significantly improves the imaging throughput by reducing both the acquisition
and computational times. The proposed CNN is based on the conditional
generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework. Additionally, we also exploit
transfer learning so that our pre-trained CNN can be further optimized to image
other cell types. Our technique demonstrates a promising deep learning approach
to continuously monitor large live-cell populations over an extended time and
gather useful spatial and temporal information with sub-cellular resolution.

  Light Communication Receiver","In review process of ATC'18, HCMC, Vietnam",,,,"eess.SP cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visible light communication (VLC)-based beacon systems, which usually
transmit identification (ID) information in small-size data frames are applied
widely in indoor localization applications. There is one fact that flicker of
LED light should be avoid in any VLC systems. Current flicker mitigation
solutions based on run-length limited (RLL) codes suffer from reduced code
rates, or are limited to hard-decoding forward error correction (FEC) decoders.
Recently, soft-decoding techniques of RLL-codes are proposed to support
soft-decoding FEC algorithms, but they contain potentials of high-complexity
and time-consuming computations. Fortunately, non-RLL direct current
(DC)-balance solutions can overcome the drawbacks of RLL-based algorithms,
however, they meet some difficulties in system latency or inferior
error-correction performances. Recently, non-RLL flicker mitigation solution
based on Polar code has proved to be an optimal approach due to its natural
equal probabilities of short runs of 1's and 0's with high error-correction
performance. However, we found that this solution can only maintain the DC
balance only when the data frame length is sufficiently long. Accordingly,
short beacon-based data frames might still be a big challenge for flicker
mitigation in such non-RLL cases. In this paper, we introduce a flicker
mitigation solution designed for VLC-based beacon systems that combines a
simple pre-scrambler with a Polar encoder which has a codeword smaller than the
previous work 8 times. We also propose a hardware architecture for the proposed
compact non-RLL VLC receiver for the first time. Also, a 3-bit soft-decision
filter is introduce to enable soft-decoding of Polar decoder to improve the
performance of the receiver.

pay attention to different aspects of the image, and yield different
descriptions or interpretations under various contexts. Such diversity in
perspectives is difficult to derive with conventional image description
techniques. In this paper, we propose a customized image narrative generation
task, in which the users are interactively engaged in the generation process by
providing answers to the questions. We further attempt to learn the user's
interest via repeating such interactive stages, and to automatically reflect
the interest in descriptions for new images. Experimental results demonstrate
that our model can generate a variety of descriptions from single image that
cover a wider range of topics than conventional models, while being
customizable to the target user of interaction.

  Combinatorial Test Suite Minimization Problem","41 pages","PLoS One 2018","10.1371/journal.pone.0195675",,"cs.AI cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The sine-cosine algorithm (SCA) is a new population-based meta-heuristic
algorithm. In addition to exploiting sine and cosine functions to perform local
and global searches (hence the name sine-cosine), the SCA introduces several
random and adaptive parameters to facilitate the search process. Although it
shows promising results, the search process of the SCA is vulnerable to local
minima/maxima due to the adoption of a fixed switch probability and the bounded
magnitude of the sine and cosine functions (from -1 to 1). In this paper, we
propose a new hybrid Q-learning sine-cosine- based strategy, called the
Q-learning sine-cosine algorithm (QLSCA). Within the QLSCA, we eliminate the
switching probability. Instead, we rely on the Q-learning algorithm (based on
the penalty and reward mechanism) to dynamically identify the best operation
during runtime. Additionally, we integrate two new operations (L\'evy flight
motion and crossover) into the QLSCA to facilitate jumping out of local
minima/maxima and enhance the solution diversity. To assess its performance, we
adopt the QLSCA for the combinatorial test suite minimization problem.
Experimental results reveal that the QLSCA is statistically superior with
regard to test suite size reduction compared to recent state-of-the-art
strategies, including the original SCA, the particle swarm test generator
(PSTG), adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) and the cuckoo search
strategy (CS) at the 95% confidence level. However, concerning the comparison
with discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO), there is no significant
difference in performance at the 95% confidence level. On a positive note, the
QLSCA statistically outperforms the DPSO in certain configurations at the 90%
confidence level.

gave evidence for a global ocean under a surrounding solid ice shell on
Saturn's moon Enceladus. Images of Enceladus' South Pole showed several
fissures in the ice shell with plumes constantly exhausting frozen water
particles, building up the E-Ring, one of the outer rings of Saturn. In this
southern region of Enceladus, the ice shell is considered to be as thin as 2
km, about an order of magnitude thinner than on the rest of the moon. Under the
ice shell, there is a global ocean consisting of liquid water. Scientists are
discussing different approaches the possibilities of taking samples of water,
i.e. by melting through the ice using a melting probe. FH Aachen UAS developed
a prototype of maneuverable melting probe which can navigate through the ice
that has already been tested successfully in a terrestrial environment. This
means no atmosphere and or ambient pressure, low ice temperatures of around 100
to 150 K (near the South Pole) and a very low gravity of 0.114 m/s$^2$ or 1100
{\mu}g. Two of these influencing measures are about to be investigated at FH
Aachen UAS in 2017, low ice temperature and low ambient pressure below the
triple point of water. Low gravity cannot be easily simulated inside a large
experiment chamber, though. Numerical simulations of the melting process at
RWTH Aachen however are showing a gravity dependence of melting behavior.
Considering this aspect, VIPER provides a link between large-scale experimental
simulations at FH Aachen UAS and numerical simulations at RWTH Aachen. To
analyze the melting process, about 90 seconds of experiment time in reduced
gravity and low ambient pressure is provided by the REXUS rocket.

to describe the creep reduction due to deposition of hydrated material in the
pores of concrete. The concept of self-equilibrated nanoscale microprestress
has been accepted as a viable model for marked multi-decade decline of creep
viscosity after the hydration effect became too feeble, and for increase of
creep viscosity after any sudden change of pore humidity or temperature.
Recently, though, it appeared that the original microprestress-solidification
theory (MPS) predicts incorrectly the diffusion size effect on drying creep and
the delay of drying creep behind drying shrinkage. Presented here is an
extension (XMPS) that overcomes both problems and also improves a few other
features of the model response. To this end, different nano- and macro-scale
viscosities are distinguished. The aforementioned incorrect predictions are
overcome by a dependence of the macro-scale viscosity on the rate of pore
humidity change, which is a new feature inspired by previous molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations of a molecular layer of water moving between two parallel
sliding C-S-H sheets. The aging is based on calculating the hydration degree,
and the temperature change effect on pore relative humidity is taken into
account. Empirical formula for estimating the parameters of permeability
dependence on pore humidity from concrete mix composition are also developed.
Extensive validations by pertinent test data from the literature are
demonstrated.
