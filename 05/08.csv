representation of the two tracks and predicts the amount of pitch-shifting in
cents required to make the voice sound in-tune with the accompaniment. It is
trained on examples of semi-professional singing. The proposed approach differs
from existing real-time pitch correction methods by replacing pitch tracking
and mapping to a discrete set of notes---for example, the twelve classes of the
equal-tempered scale---with learning a correction that is continuous both in
frequency and in time directly from the harmonics of the vocal and
accompaniment tracks. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model provides a
correction that takes context into account, preserving expressive pitch bending
and vibrato. This method can be extended into unsupervised pitch correction of
a vocal performance---popularly referred to as autotuning.

one to pass to the limit of first and second Gateaux variations for the

interface limit, including boundary terms, by considering non-compactly
supported velocity and acceleration fields in our variations. This complements
the results of Tonegawa, and Tonegawa and Wickramasekera, where interior
stability is shown to pass to the limit. As a further application, we prove an
asymptotic upper bound on the $k^{th}$ Neumann eigenvalue of the linearization
of the Allen-Cahn operator, relating it to the $k^{th}$ Robin eigenvalue of the
Jacobi operator, taken with respect to the minimal surface arising as the
asymptotic location of the zero set of the Allen-Cahn critical points. We also
prove analogous results for eigenvalues of the linearized operators arising in
the Cahn-Hilliard and Ohta-Kawasaki settings. These complement the earlier
result of the first author where such an asymptotic upper bound is achieved for
Dirichlet eigenvalues for the linearized Allen-Cahn operator. Our asymptotic
upper bound on Allen-Cahn Neumann eigenvalues extends, in one direction, the
asymptotic equivalence of these eigenvalues established in the work of
Kowalczyk in the two-dimensional case where the minimal surface is a line

of quasi-pmp actions of countable groups. For ergodic graphs, the theorem gives
an increasing sequence of Borel subgraphs with finite connected components over
which the averages of any $L^1$ function converges to its expectation. This
implies that every (not necessarily pmp) locally countable ergodic Borel graph
on a standard probability space contains an ergodic hyperfinite subgraph. A
consequence of this is that every ergodic treeable equivalence relation has an
ergodic hyperfinite free factor.
  The pmp case of the main theorem was first proven by R. Tucker-Drob using a
deep result from probability theory. Our proof is different: it is
self-contained and applies more generally to quasi-pmp graphs. Among other
things, it involves introducing a graph invariant concerning asymptotic
averages of functions and a method of tiling a large part of the space with
finite sets with prescribed properties. The non-pmp setting additionally
exploits a new quasi-order called visibility to analyze the interplay between
the Radon--Nikodym cocycle and the graph structure, providing a sufficient

the reddest-color sequence are likely dominated by the dynamically-hot tail of
the thick disk population. Information from Nissen & Schuster (2010) and from
the APOGEE survey suggests that stars in the blue-color sequence have elemental
abundance patterns that can be explained by this population having a relatively
low star-formation efficiency during its formation. In dynamical and orbital
spaces, such as the `Toomre diagram', the two sequences show a significant
overlap, but with a tendency for stars on the blue-color sequence to dominate
regions with no or retrograde rotation and high total orbital energy. In the
plane defined by the maximal vertical excursion of the orbits versus their
apocenters, stars of both sequences redistribute into discrete wedges. We
conclude that stars which are typically assigned to the halo in the solar
vicinity are actually both accreted stars lying along the blue sequence in the
HR diagram, and the low velocity tail of the old Galactic disk, possibly
dynamically heated by past accretion events. Our results imply that a halo
population formed in situ and responsible for the early chemical enrichment
prior to the formation of the thick disk is yet to be robustly identified, and
that what has been defined as the stars of the in situ stellar halo of the
Galaxy may be in fact fossil records of its last significant merger.

In both cases, the system transforms to high-density amorphous ice (HDA) via a
first-order-like phase transition. We employ a sensitive local order metric
(LOM) [Martelli et. al., Phys. Rev. B, 97, 064105 (2018)], that can
discriminate among different crystalline and non crystalline ice structures and
is based on the positions of the oxygen atoms in the first and/or second

i.e., they lack of polydispersed ice domains. Interestingly, HDA contains a
small number of domains that are reminiscent of the unit cell of ice IV,
although the hydrogen-bond network (HBN) of these domains differ from the HBN
of ice IV. The presence of ice IV-like domains provides some support to the
hypothesis that HDA could be the result of a detour on the HBN rearrangement
along the I$h$-to-ice IV pressure induced transformation. Both nonequilibrium
LDA-to-HDA and I$h$-to-HDA transformations are two-steps processes where a
small distortion of the HBN first occurs at low pressures and then, a sudden,
extensive re-arrangement of hydrogen bonds at the corresponding transformation
pressure follows. Interestingly, the I$h$-to-HDA and LDA-to-HDA transformations
occur when LDA and I$h$ have similar local order, as quantified by the
site-averaged LOMs. Since I$h$ has a perfect tetrahedral HBN, while LDA does
not, it follows that higher pressures are needed to transform I$h$ into HDA
than that for the conversion of LDA to HDA. In correspondence with both
first-order-like phase transitions, the samples are composed of a large HDA
cluster that percolates within the I$h$/LDA samples.

Diabetes (T1D) with the gene expression data collected from both the patients

to the existing methods, the proposed method has a few significant advantages.
First, it includes a meta-analysis procedure to explicitly integrate
information across distinct conditions. In contrast, the existing methods often
integrate information through prior distributions or penalty function, which is
usually less efficient. Second, instead of working on original data, the
Bayesian step of the proposed method works on edge-wise scores, through which
the proposed method avoids to invert high-dimensional covariance matrices and
thus can perform very fast. The edge-wise score forms an equivalent measure of
the partial correlation coefficient and thus provides a good summary for the
graph structure information contained in the data under each condition. Third,
the proposed method can provide an overall uncertainty measure for the edges
detected in multiple graphical models, while the existing methods only produce
a point estimate or are feasible for very small size problems. We prove
consistency of the proposed method under mild conditions and illustrate its
performance using simulated and real data examples. The numerical results
indicate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing ones in both
estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Extension of the proposed
method to joint estimation of multiple mixed graphical models is
straightforward.

superconductivity, which is given by a family of first order non-linear
ordinary differential equations on two-torus depending on three parameters: a
fixed parameter $\omega$ (the frequency); a pair of variable parameters $(B,A)$
(abscissa and ordinate). It is important to study the rotation number of the
system as a function $\rho=\rho(B,A)$ and to describe the phase-lock areas: its
level sets $L_r=\{\rho =r\}$ with non-empty interiors. They were studied by
V.M.Buchstaber, O.V.Karpov, S.I.Tertychnyi, who observed in 2010 that the
phase-lock areas exist only for integer values of the rotation number. It is
known that each phase-lock area is a garland of infinitely many bounded domains
going to infinity in the vertical direction; each two subsequent domains are
separated by one point called constriction (if it does not lie in the abscissa
axis). There is a conjecture stating that all the constrictions of every
phase-lock area $L_r$ lie in its axis $\Lambda_r=\{ B=r\omega\}$. Another
conjecture states that for any two subsequent constrictions in $L_r$ with
positive ordinates the interval between them also lies in $L_r$. In the present
paper we give new results partially confirming both conjectures. The main
result states that the intersection $L_r\cap\Lambda_r$ contains an explicit
infinite interval of the axis $\Lambda_r$ (conjecturally a connected component
of the latter intersection). The proof is done by studying an equivalent family
of systems of second order linear differential equations on the Riemann sphere.
We obtain new results on the Stokes multipliers and the transition matrix
between appropriate canonical solution bases of the linear system and deduce
the main result on non-linear systems on two-torus.

a generalization of quantum mutual information in the spirit of relative

of purification $\Delta_W$, as a sum of minimal areas of codimension-2 surfaces
which divide the entanglement wedge into multi-pieces. We prove that this
geometrical quantity satisfies all properties we proved for the multipartite
entanglement of purification. These agreements strongly support the
$\Delta_{P}=\Delta_{W}$ conjecture. We also show that the multipartite

entanglement. We discuss potential saturation of multipartite squashed

methods for minimizing the average of a very large number of smooth functions.
Our method --JacSketch-- is motivated by novel developments in randomized
numerical linear algebra, and operates by maintaining a stochastic estimate of
a Jacobian matrix composed of the gradients of individual functions. In each
iteration, JacSketch efficiently updates the Jacobian matrix by first obtaining
a random linear measurement of the true Jacobian through (cheap) sketching, and
then projecting the previous estimate onto the solution space of a linear
matrix equation whose solutions are consistent with the measurement. The
Jacobian estimate is then used to compute a variance-reduced unbiased estimator
of the gradient. Our strategy is analogous to the way quasi-Newton methods
maintain an estimate of the Hessian, and hence our method can be seen as a
stochastic quasi-gradient method. We prove that for smooth and strongly convex
functions, JacSketch converges linearly with a meaningful rate dictated by a
single convergence theorem which applies to general sketches. We also provide a
refined convergence theorem which applies to a smaller class of sketches. This
enables us to obtain sharper complexity results for variants of JacSketch with
importance sampling. By specializing our general approach to specific sketching
strategies, JacSketch reduces to the stochastic average gradient (SAGA) method,
and several of its existing and many new minibatch, reduced memory, and
importance sampling variants. Our rate for SAGA with importance sampling is the
current best-known rate for this method, resolving a conjecture by Schmidt et
al (2015). The rates we obtain for minibatch SAGA are also superior to existing
rates.

  $$
  \left\{

  Next, we analyze the limit as $p\to \infty$. We obtain that any sequence of
weak solutions converges, up to a subsequence, $\lim\limits_{p_j \to \infty}
u_{p_j}(x)=u_{\infty}(x)$, uniformly in $\overline{\Omega}$, and uniform
limits, $u_\infty$, are solutions to the maximization problem with volume

  Furthermore, we obtain the limit equation that is verified by $u_\infty$ in
the viscosity sense. Finally, it turns out that such a limit variational
problem is connected to the Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problem with the
involved measures are supported on $\partial \Omega$ and along the limiting

distribution of certain underlying state process. It is a powerful tool for
studying the limit behavior of large interacting systems, including mean field
games and systemic risk. It also appears naturally in stochastic control
problems with partial information and in time inconsistent problems. In this
paper we propose a novel notion of viscosity solution for parabolic master
equations, arising mainly from control problems, and establish its
wellposedness. Our main innovation is to restrict the involved measures to
certain set of semimartingale measures which satisfy the desired compactness.
As an important example, we study the HJB master equation associated with the
control problems for McKean-Vlasov SDEs. Due to practical considerations, we
consider closed-loop controls. It turns out that the regularity of the value
function becomes much more involved in this framework than the counterpart in
the standard control problems. Finally, we build the whole theory in the path

It\^{o} formula requires a special structure of the derivatives with respect to
the measures, which was originally due to Lions \cite{Lions4} in the state

We first review the generation of temporal cluster states and the
implementation of gates using the measurement-based model. Alongside this we
discuss methods to introduce non-Gaussianity into the cluster states. The first
algorithm we consider is Gaussian Boson Sampling in which only Gaussian
unitaries need to be implemented. Taking into account the fact that input
states are also Gaussian, the errors due to the effect of finite squeezing can
be corrected, provided a moderate amount of online squeezing is available. This
helps to construct a large Gaussian Boson Sampling machine. The second
algorithm is the continuous-variable Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial circuit
in which one needs to implement non-Gaussian gates, such as the cubic phase
gate. We discuss several methods of implementing the cubic phase gate and fit
them into the temporal cluster state architecture. The third algorithm is the
continuous-variable version of Grover's search algorithm, the main challenge of

8 nearby ULIRGs ($0.04 < z < 0.2$) taken with the ISIS spectrograph on the
\textit{William Herschel Telescope} (WHT), and also summarise the results of
the project as a whole. Consistent with \cite{Rose2018}, we find that the
outflow regions are compact (0.08 < $R_{[OIII]}$ < 1.5 kpc), and the electron
densities measured using the [SII], [OII] trans-auroral emission-line ratios
are relatively high (2.5 < log n$_{e}$(cm$^{-3}$) < 4.5, median log
n$_{e}$(cm$^{-3})\sim 3.1$). Many of the outflow regions are also significantly
reddened (median E(B-V) $\sim$ 0.5). Assuming that the de-projected outflow
velocities are represented by the 5$\rm^{th}$ percentile velocities ($v_{05}$)
of the broad, blueshifted components of [OIII]$\lambda$5007, we calculate
relatively modest mass outflow rates ($0.1 < \dot{M} < 20$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$, median $\dot{M}$ $\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), and find kinetic
powers as a fraction of the AGN bolometric luminosity ($\dot{F} =
\dot{E}/L_{bol}$) in the range 0.02 < $\dot{F}$ < 3 \%, median $\dot{F}$ $\sim$
0.3 \%). The latter estimates are in line with the predictions of multi-stage
outflow models, or single-stage models in which only a modest fraction of the
initial kinetic power of the inner disk winds is transferred to the
larger-scale outflows. Considering the QUADROS sample as a whole, we find no
clear evidence for correlations between the properties of the outflows and the
bolometric luminosities of the AGN, albeit based on a sample that covers a
relatively small range in $L_{bol}$. Overall, our results suggest that there is
a significant intrinsic scatter in outflow properties of ULIRGs for a given AGN
luminosity.

orientations of galaxies on the sky, are both a significant systematic in weak
lensing and a probe of the effect of large-scale structure on galactic
structure and angular momentum. In the era of precision cosmology, it is thus
especially important to model IA with high accuracy. Efforts to use
cosmological perturbation theory to model the dependence of IA on the
large-scale structure have thus far been relatively successful; however, extant
models do not consistently account for time evolution. In particular, advection
of galaxies due to peculiar velocities alters the impact of IA, because galaxy
positions when observed are generally different from their positions at the
epoch when IA is believed to be set. In this work, we evolve the galaxy IA from
the time of galaxy formation to the time at which they are observed, including
the effects of this advection, and show how this process naturally leads to a
dependence of IA on the velocity shear. We calculate the galaxy-galaxy-IA
bispectrum to tree level (in the linear matter density) in terms of the evolved
IA coefficients. We then discuss the implications for weak lensing systematics
as well as for studies of galaxy formation and evolution. We find that
considering advection introduces nonlocality into the bispectrum, and that the

lifetimes to the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way. Within this theory,
the cloud lifetime in the Galactic centre is obtained by combining the
time-scales for gravitational instability, galactic shear, epicyclic
perturbations and cloud-cloud collisions. We find that at galactocentric radii
$\sim 45$-$120$ pc, corresponding to the location of the '100-pc stream', cloud
evolution is primarily dominated by gravitational collapse, with median cloud
lifetimes between 1.4 and 3.9 Myr. At all other galactocentric radii, galactic
shear dominates the cloud lifecycle, and we predict that molecular clouds are
dispersed on time-scales between 3 and 9 Myr, without a significant degree of
star formation. Along the outer edge of the 100-pc stream, between radii of 100
and 120 pc, the time-scales for epicyclic perturbations and gravitational
free-fall are similar. This similarity of time-scales lends support to the
hypothesis that, depending on the orbital geometry and timing of the orbital
phase, cloud collapse and star formation in the 100-pc stream may be triggered
by a tidal compression at pericentre. Based on the derived time-scales, this
should happen in approximately 20 per cent of all accretion events onto the

emission within the innermost $\sim {17}\,$pc around the black hole to be of
non-thermal, synchrotron origin and to set a limit to the maximum contribution
of a standard accretion disc. Assuming the canonical 10 per cent mass-light
conversion efficiency for the standard accretion disc, its inferred accretion
power would be too low by one order of magnitude to account for the observed
continuum luminosity. We thus introduce a truncated accretion disc and derive a
truncation radius to mass-light conversion efficiency relation, which we use to
reconcile the inferred accretion power with the continuum luminosity. As a
result we find that a truncated disc providing the necessary accretion power
must be truncated at $r_\text{tr} \gtrsim {26}\, r_\text{g}$, consistent with
the inner radius derived from the observations of the Fe K$\alpha$ line in the

3) offset between the potential minimum and the center of mass. The octant
analysis is a new method that we introduce in this work. We find that none of
the diagnostics indicate a correlation between the mass of the cluster and the
fraction of substructures. On the other hand, all the diagnostics suggest an
evolution of substructures with redshift. For SUBFIND halos, the mass fraction
is constant with redshift at $R_{\mathrm{vir}}$, but shows a mild evolution at
$R_{200}$ and $R_{500}$. Also, the fraction of clusters with at least a subhalo
more massive than one thirtieth of the total mass is less than $20 \%$. Our new
method based on the octants returns a mass fraction in substructures which has
a strong evolution with redshift at all radii. The offsets also evolve strongly
with redshift. We also find a strong correlation for individual clusters

effective field theories, realising a consistent UV complete model in e.g.
string theory is a non-trivial task. For one, one expects quantum corrections
arising in the vicinity of the pole which may spoil the typical attractor
dynamics. As a conservative estimate of the range of validity of supergravity
models of pole inflation we employ the weak gravity conjecture (WGC). We find
that this constrains the accessible part of the inflationary plateau by
limiting the decay constant of the axion partner. For the original single
complex field models, the WGC does not even allow the inflaton to reach the
inflationary plateau region. We analyze if evoking the assistance of $N$ scalar
fields from the open string moduli helps addressing these problems. Pole
$N$-flation could improve radiative control by reducing the required range of
each individual field. However, the WGC bound prohibiting pole inflation for a
single such field persists even for a collective motion of $N$ such scalars if
we impose the sublattice WGC. Finally, we outline steps towards an embedding of

the fraction of super Earths with cold Jupiters can rise to $60\%$ or higher;
(2) the inner architecture can be strongly impacted by the outer giant and we

star-forming galaxies follow coherent scaling relations out to z~3, suggesting
remarkable regularity of the interplay between molecular gas, star formation,
and stellar growth. Passive galaxies, however, are expected to be gas-poor and
therefore faint, and thus little is known about molecular gas in passive
galaxies beyond the local universe. Here we present deep Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of CO(2-1) emission in 8
massive (Mstar ~ 10^11 Msol) galaxies at z~0.7 selected to lie a factor of 3-10
below the star-forming sequence at this redshift, drawn from the Large Early
Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey. We significantly detect half the
sample, finding molecular gas fractions <~0.1. We show that the molecular and
stellar rotational axes are broadly consistent, arguing that the molecular gas
was not accreted after the galaxies became quiescent. We find that scaling
relations extrapolated from the star-forming population over-predict both the
gas fraction and gas depletion time for passive objects, suggesting the
existence of either a break or large increase in scatter in these relations at
low specific star formation rate. Finally, we show that the gas fractions of
the passive galaxies we have observed at intermediate redshifts are naturally
consistent with evolution into local massive early-type galaxies by continued
low-level star formation, with no need for further gas accretion or dynamical
stabilization of the gas reservoirs in the intervening 6 billion years.

charge is a crucial quantity since it controls dipole radiation, which can be

However in most such theories, computing the scalar charge requires
simultaneously solving the coupled, nonlinear metric and scalar field equations
of motion. In this article we prove that in linearly-coupled
Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, a black hole's scalar charge is
completely determined by the horizon surface gravity times the Euler

surface gravity to the rest of the universe through the dilaton field. In our
proof, a 4-dimensional topological density descends to a 2-dimensional
topological density on the bifurcation surface of a Killing horizon. We also
comment on how our proof can be generalized to other topological densities on
general G-bundles, and to theories where the dilaton is non-linearly coupled to
the Euler density.

baryon asymmetry of the Universe based on the non-trivial interplay between
quintessential inflationary models containing a kinetic dominated
post-inflationary era and a non-minimally coupled $U(1)$ field with a weakly
broken $B-L$ symmetry. The non-minimal coupling to gravity renders heavy the
Affleck-Dine field during inflation and avoids the generation of isocurvature
fluctuations. During the subsequent kinetic era the Ricci scalar changes sign
and the effective mass term of the Affleck-Dine field becomes tachyonic. This
allows the field to dynamically acquire a large expectation value. The symmetry
of the Affleck-Dine potential is automatically restored at the onset of
radiation domination, when the Ricci scalar approximately equals zero. This
inverse phase transition results in the coherent oscillation of the scalar

displaced Affleck-Dine field in the complex plane generates a non-zero $B-L$
asymmetry which can be eventually converted into a baryon asymmetry via the
usual transfer mechanisms.

nine distinct magnetic field morphologies, including helical, toroidal, and

polarization traces the projected plane-of-the-sky magnetic field morphology.
Zeeman line splitting delivers simultaneously the intensity-weighted
line-of-sight field strength and direction. We show that linear dust
polarization alone is unable to uniquely constrain the 3D field morphology. We
demonstrate that these ambiguities are ameliorated or resolved with the
addition of the Zeeman directional information. Thus, observations of both the

means for obtaining constraints of the 3D magnetic field configuration. We find
that the Zeeman-derived field strengths are at least a factor of a few below

that such a nonlocal theory potentially includes a ghost mode near the nonlocal

nonlinear activation layer and an output weighted sum layer. We analyze
Gradient Descent applied to learning a bounded target function on $n$
real-valued inputs. We give an agnostic learning guarantee for GD: starting
from a randomly initialized network, it converges in mean squared loss to the
minimum error (in $2$-norm) of the best approximation of the target function
using a polynomial of degree at most $k$. Moreover, for any $k$, the size of
the network and number of iterations needed are both bounded by
$n^{O(k)}\log(1/\epsilon)$. In particular, this applies to training networks of
unbiased sigmoids and ReLUs. We also rigorously explain the empirical finding
that gradient descent discovers lower frequency Fourier components before
higher frequency components.
  We complement this result with nearly matching lower bounds in the
Statistical Query model. GD fits well in the SQ framework since each training
step is determined by an expectation over the input distribution. We show that
any SQ algorithm that achieves significant improvement over a constant function
with queries of tolerance some inverse polynomial in the input dimensionality
$n$ must use $n^{\Omega(k)}$ queries even when the target functions are
restricted to a set of $n^{O(k)}$ degree-$k$ polynomials, and the input
distribution is uniform over the unit sphere; for this class the
information-theoretic lower bound is only $\Theta(k \log n)$.
  Our approach for both parts is based on spherical harmonics. We view gradient
descent as an operator on the space of functions, and study its dynamics. An
essential tool is the Funk-Hecke theorem, which explains the eigenfunctions of
this operator in the case of the mean squared loss.

The origin was the active region AR 12673 when it was located at the edge of
the west solar disk, magnetically poorly connected with Earth. However, there
was a peculiar condition: the solar protons accelerated by the CME shocks were
injected within a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) region when Earth was
crossing this region. We show that often HCS and SEPs propagation are closely
related. If the source locations of SEPs are within or close to HCS, the HCS
play the role of a Sun$-$Earth magnetic connection. SEPs drift around HCS
paths, and SEPs are also drift in a wide range of longitudes by the HCSs. In
some cases, and especially when Earth crosses the HCS sector, a fraction of
these particles can reach Earth with a harder energetic particle flux,
triggering a ground-level enhancement (GLE). The blast on 2017 September 10,

show that the two GLEs, including all sub-GLEs observed in the current solar

behavior is also observed in the GLEs of the previous solar cycle. In general,
solar explosions from active regions poorly connected with Earth can trigger
GLEs, through the mechanism described above. In all cases, the SEPs drift
processes by HCS structures provides an efficient particle transport, allowing

Abstract: Complex networks are often categorized according to the underlying
phenomena that they represent such as molecular interactions, re-tweets, and
brain activity. In this work, we investigate the problem of predicting the
category (domain) of arbitrary networks. This includes complex networks from
different domains as well as synthetically generated graphs from five different
network models. A classification accuracy of $96.6\%$ is achieved using a
random forest classifier with both real and synthetic networks. This work makes
two important findings. First, our results indicate that complex networks from
various domains have distinct structural properties that allow us to predict
with high accuracy the category of a new previously unseen network. Second,
synthetic graphs are trivial to classify as the classification model can
predict with near-certainty the network model used to generate it. Overall, the
results demonstrate that networks drawn from different domains (and network
models) are trivial to distinguish using only a handful of simple structural
properties.

model, where the fibers are linear elastic objects attached between two plates.
The failure threshold of the system varies non-monotonically with the fraction
of the system on which the load is applied initially, provided the load sharing
mechanism following a local failure is sufficiently wide. In this case, there
exists a finite value for the initial loading fraction, for which the damage on
the system will be maximum, or in other words the global failure threshold will
be minimum for a finite value of the initial loading fraction. This particular
value of initial loading fraction, however, goes to zero when the load sharing
is sufficiently local. Such crossover behavior, seen for both one and two
dimensional versions of the model, can give very useful information about
stability of interconnected systems with random failure thresholds.

main objective of our work is to improve the performance capabilities of

firstly propose several obfuscation techniques of remote attacks that are based
on the modification of various properties of network connections; then we
conduct a set of comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of
intrusion detection classifiers against obfuscated attacks. We instantiate our
approach by means of a tool, based on NetEm and Metasploit, which implements
our obfuscation operators on any TCP communication. This allows us to generate
modified network traffic for machine learning experiments employing features
for assessing network statistics and behavior of TCP connections. We perform
the evaluation of five classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Gaussian Naive Bayes
with kernel density estimation, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support
Vector Machines. Our experiments confirm the assumption that it is possible to
evade the intrusion detection capability of all classifiers trained without
prior knowledge about obfuscated attacks, causing an exacerbation of the TPR
ranging from 7.8% to 66.8%. Further, when widening the training knowledge of
the classifiers by a subset of obfuscated attacks, we achieve a significant
improvement of the TPR by 4.21% - 73.3%, while the FPR is deteriorated only
slightly (0.1% - 1.48%). Finally, we test the capability of an
obfuscations-aware classifier to detect unknown obfuscated attacks, where we
achieve over 90% detection rate on average for most of the obfuscations.

$\nu_i \to \nu_j\,\gamma$ induced by effective magnetic and electric transition

population of mirror photons that are then ""processed"" into visible photons
through resonant conversion, thus accounting for the EDGES signal. We point out
that the mechanism can work for mirror neutrinos which are either heavier than

hot metal-rich outflows preferentially aligned with the large-scale axes of
X-ray cavities with typical outflow masses of around $10^{9} $ - $10^{10}
M_{\odot}$. Here we perform a suite of three hydrodynamic simulations to
investigate whether AGN jets could drive these metal-rich outflows in a
representative cluster. By using both the tracer variable and virtual particle
methods, and additionally following the gas metallicity evolution, we show that
metal-rich gas initially located in central regions can indeed be uplifted by
the AGN bubble to large distances, a phenomenon called Darwin drift in fluid
mechanics, and forming a filamentary trailing outflow extending beyond $100$
kpc behind the bubble. The gas entrained in the trailing outflow is entirely
outflowing with an average outflow rate of nearly $100M_{\odot}$/yr during the
first $100$ Myr, and at later times, a growing lower part flows back towards
the cluster center due to gravity. The outflow mass rises up to about $10^{10}
M_{\odot}$ with entrained iron mass of about $10^{6} - 10^{7}M_{\odot}$,
consistent with observations and predictions from the drift model. By the end
of our simulation ($\sim 800$ Myr after the AGN event), several
$10^{9}M_{\odot}$ of the uplifted high-metallicity gas still remains at large
altitudes, potentially contributing to the enrichment of the bulk ICM and the
broadening of central metallicity peaks observed in cool core clusters.

classical formulation of quantum mechanics, posed a large deviation problem for
a cloud of independent Brownian particles. He showed that the solution to the
problem could be obtained trough a system of two linear equations with
nonlinear coupling at the boundary (Schr\""odinger system). Existence and
uniqueness for such a system, which represents a sort of bottleneck for the
problem, was first established by R. Fortet in 1938/40 under rather general
assumptions by proving convergence of an ingenious but complex approximation
method. It is the first proof of what are nowadays called Sinkhorn-type
algorithms in the much more challenging continuous case. Schr\""odinger bridges
are also an early example of the maximum entropy approach and have been more
recently recognized as a regularization of the important Optimal Mass Transport
problem. Unfortunately, Fortet's contribution is by and large ignored in
contemporary literature. This is likely due to the complexity of his approach
coupled with an idiosyncratic exposition style and to missing details and steps
in the proofs. Nevertheless, Fortet's approach maintains its importance to this
day as it provides the only existing algorithmic proof under rather mild
assumptions. It can be adapted, in principle, to other relevant problems such
as the regularized Wasserstein barycenter problem. It is the purpose of this
paper to remedy this situation by rewriting the bulk of his paper with all the
missing passages and in a transparent fashion so as to make it fully available

reformulated as a single-state recurrent neural network (RNN) with finite
unfoldings. In this paper, we explore new structures for SR based on this
compact RNN view, leading us to a dual-state design, the Dual-State Recurrent
Network (DSRN). Compared to its single state counterparts that operate at a
fixed spatial resolution, DSRN exploits both low-resolution (LR) and
high-resolution (HR) signals jointly. Recurrent signals are exchanged between
these states in both directions (both LR to HR and HR to LR) via delayed
feedback. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark
datasets and on a recent challenge demonstrate that the proposed DSRN performs
favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both memory

which has attracted tremendous interests from both the research communities and
industries. The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial
sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data
ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for
decentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat,
open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of
decentralization, immutability and self-organization are primarily owing to the
unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks.
This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on
the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks.
In this survey, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of
blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of incentivized
consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art
consensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus
system design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a
game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review on the strategy
adoption for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain
backbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey on the
emerging applications of the blockchain networks in a wide range of areas. We
highlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact these
applications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol design
for blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.

network performance metrics such as the handoff rate, handoff probability,
sojourn time, direction switch rate, and users' throughput or coverage. This
characterization is particularly challenging for heterogeneous,
dense/ultra-dense, and random cellular networks such as the emerging 5G and
beyond 5G (B5G) networks. In this article, we provide a tutorial on
mobility-aware performance analysis of both the spatially random and
non-random, single-tier and multi-tier cellular networks. We first provide a
summary of the different mobility models which include purely random models,
spatially correlated, and temporally correlated models. The differences among
various mobility models, their statistical properties, and their pros and cons

square lattice, hexagon lattice, single-tier and multi-tier models in which

discuss some limitations/imperfections of the existing techniques and provide
corrections to these imperfections. Finally, we point out specific 5G
application scenarios where the impact of mobility would be significant and

With the well-defined and carefully-selected large samples, we find for the
first time a turn-off P-M correlation of Delta [Fe/H]_(SWPs-SNPs), which in
average increases from ~0.00+-0.03 dex to 0.06+-0.03 dex, and to 0.12+-0.03 for
stars with Earth, Neptune, Jupiter-sized planets successively, and then
declines to ~-0.01+-0.03 dex for more massive planets or brown dwarfs.
Moreover, the percentage of those systems with positive Delta[Fe/H] has the
same turn-off pattern. We also find FG-type stars follow this general trend,
but K-type stars are different. Moderate metal enhancement (~0.1-0.2 dex) for
K-type stars with planets of radii between 2 to 4 Earth radius as compared to
CKSNPs is observed, which indicates much higher metallicities are required for
Super-Earths, Neptune-sized planets to form around K-type stars. We point out
that the P-M correlation is actually metallicity-dependent, i.e., the
correlation is positive at solar and super-solar metallicities, and negative at
subsolar metallicities. No steady increase of Delta[Fe/H] against planet sizes
is observed for rocky planets, excluding the pollution scenario as a major
mechanism for the P-M correlation. All these clues suggest that giant planets
probably form differently from rocky planets or more massive planets/brown
dwarfs, and the core-accretion scenario is highly favoured, and high
metallicity is a prerequisite for massive planets to form.

H.P. McKean under a constant negative bound from above on the sectional
curvatures. If the power is equal to the critical value $ -2 $ we show that $ p
$ must necessarily be bounded away from $ 2 $. Upon assuming that the Ricci
curvature vanishes at infinity, the nonradial version of such inequalities
turns out to fail, except in the Sobolev case. Finally, we discuss applications
of the here-established Sobolev-type inequalities to optimal smoothing effects
for radial porous medium equations.

the path for autonomous agents. Such controllers can be expert-designed
policies, which typically require tuning of parameters for each task scenario.
In this context, Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a promising approach
for automatically tuning controllers. However, when performing BO on hardware
for high-dimensional policies, sample-efficiency can be an issue. Here, we
develop an approach that utilizes simulation to map the original parameter
space into a domain-informed space. During BO, similarity between controllers
is now calculated in this transformed space. Experiments on the ATRIAS robot
hardware and another bipedal robot simulation show that our approach succeeds
at sample-efficiently learning controllers for multiple robots. Another
question arises: What if the simulation significantly differs from hardware? To
answer this, we create increasingly approximate simulators and study the effect
of increasing simulation-hardware mismatch on the performance of Bayesian
optimization. We also compare our approach to other approaches from literature,
and find it to be more reliable, especially in cases of high mismatch. Our
experiments show that our approach succeeds across different controller types,
bipedal robot models and simulator fidelity levels, making it applicable to a
wide range of bipedal locomotion problems.

fluctuations in the solar wind have power law scalings with inertial-range
spectral indices of -5/3 and -3/2 respectively. Studies of solar wind
turbulence have repeatedly demonstrated the impact of discontinuities and
coherent structures on the measured spectral index. Whether or not such
discontinuities are self-generated by the turbulence or simply observations of
advected structures from the inner heliosphere has been a matter of
considerable debate. This work presents a statistical study of magnetic field
and velocity spectral indices over 10 years of solar-wind observations; we find
that anomalously steep magnetic spectra occur in magnetically dominated
intervals with negative residual energy. However, this increase in negative
residual energy has no noticeable impact on the spectral index of the velocity
fluctuations, suggesting that these intervals with negative residual energy
correspond to intermittent magnetic structures. We show statistically that the
difference between magnetic and velocity spectral indices is a monotonic
function of residual energy, consistent with previous work which suggests that
intermittency in fluctuations causes spectral steepening. Additionally, a
statistical analysis of cross helicity demonstrates that when the turbulence is
balanced (low cross-helicity), the magnetic and velocity spectral indices are
not equal, which suggests that our observations of negative residual energy and
intermittent structures are related to non-linear turbulent interactions rather
than the presence of advected pre-existing flux-tube structures.

technique to process crowdtesting reports arriving in chronological order,
organizes them into fixed-size groups as dynamic inputs, and predicts two test
completion indicators in an incrementally manner. The two indicators are:
1)total number of bugs predicted with Capture-ReCapture (CRC)model, and 2)
required test cost for achieving certain test objectives predicted with
AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA) model. We assess ISENSE using
46,434 reports of 218 crowdtesting tasks from one of the largest crowdtesting
platforms in China. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through two applications
for automating crowdtesting management, i.e. automation oftask closing
decision, and semi-automation of task closing trade-off analysis. The results
show that decision automation using ISENSE will provide managers with greater
opportunities to achieve cost-effectiveness gains of crowdtesting.
Specifically, a median of 100% bugs can be detected with 30% saved cost basedon

boundary conditions disappears. This, in turn, corresponds to deformations of
the $\text{AdS}_2$ spacetime near its spatial infinity. We also examine how
this regularization of the velocity profile picks up a specific boundary
condition for the idealized system, so that both models agree in the long
wavelength limit.

in accordance with physical intuition, particle size swaps open up an
additional channel for the relaxation of density fluctuations. Thus, allowing
swaps speeds up the dynamics and moves the dynamic glass transition towards
higher densities and/or lower temperatures. We calculate an approximate dynamic
glass transition phase diagram for an equimolar binary hard sphere mixture. We
find that in the presence of particle size swaps, with increasing ratio of the

crowdtesting reports are highly replicated, i.e., 82% of them are replicates of
others. Hence automatically detecting replicate reports could help reduce
triaging efforts. Most of the existing approaches mainly adopted textual
information for replicate detection, and suffered from low accuracy because of
the expression gap. Our observation on real industrial crowdtesting data found
that when dealing with crowdtesting reports of GUI systems, the reports would

screenshot to be valuable for replicate crowdtesting report detection because
it reflects the real scenario of the failure and is not affected by the variety

combines information from the screenshots and the textual descriptions to
detect replicate crowdtesting reports. We extract four types of features to
characterize the screenshots and the textual descriptions, and design an
algorithm to detect replicates based on four similarity scores derived from the
four different features respectively. We investigate the effectiveness and

self-interactions and non-minimal coupling to classical gravity, we define four
equal-time, spatially covariant phase-space operators through a Wigner
transformation of spatially translated canonical operators within a 3+1
decomposition. A subset of these operators can be interpreted as fluctuating
particle densities in phase-space whenever the quantum state of the system
allows for a classical limit. We come to this conclusion by expressing
hydrodynamic variables through the expectation values of these operators and
moreover, by deriving the dynamics of the expectation values within a spatial
gradient expansion and a 1-loop approximation which subsequently yields the
Vlasov equation with a self-mass correction as a limit. We keep an arbitrary
classical metric in the 3+1 decomposition which is assumed to be determined
semi-classically. Our formalism allows to systematically study the transition
from quantum field theory in curved space-time to classical particle physics
for this minimal model of self-interacting, gravitating matter. As an
application we show how to include relativistic and self-interaction
corrections to existing dark matter models in a kinetic description by taking
into account the gravitational slip, vector perturbations and tensor
perturbations.

theoretical model for relativistic nuclear spectral functions at high missing
momenta and removal energies based on the multi-nucleon short-range correlation
(SRC) model. The nuclear spectral functions are necessary for the description
of high energy nuclear processes currently being studied at different labs such
as JLAB, LHC and FNAL. The model followed the effective Feynman diagrammatic
approach in order to account for the relativistic effects important in the SRC
domain. In addition to the two-nucleon (2N) SRC with center of mass motion
contribution, the contribution of the three-nucleon SRCs to the spectral
functions was also derived. The latter was modeled based on the assumption that
the 3N SRCs are a product of two sequential short range nucleon-nucleon (NN)
interactions. The nuclear spectral functions models were derived from two
theoretical frameworks for evaluating covariant Feynman diagrams: In the first,
referred to as the virtual nucleon approximation, the Feynman diagrams were
reduced to the time ordered non-covariant diagrams by evaluating the nucleon
spectators in the SRC at their positive energy poles, neglecting explicitly the
contribution from vacuum diagrams. In the second approach, referred to as the
light-front approximation, the boost invariant nuclear spectral function was
formulated in the light-front reference frame in which case the vacuum diagrams
are kinematically suppressed and the bound nucleon is described by its
light-front variables such as momentum fraction, transverse momentum and
invariant mass. On the basis of the derived nuclear spectral functions, the
corresponding computational models were developed from which the numerical
estimates of the SRC spectral functions, the SRC momentum distributions, and
the SRC density matrices were obtained.

context of LHC searches for mediator mass from 100 GeV to several TeV. Emission
of the mediator off a quark or antiquark at LEP gives rise to di-jet plus
missing energy and 4-jet signatures, which we use to limit the relevant
couplings. We focus on scenarios with $2 m_\chi > m_R$, which are poorly
constrained by LHC data. We recast published searches by the ALEPH
collaboration. For $m_\chi < 20$ GeV the best bounds result from an analysis at
$\sqrt{s} \simeq M_Z$ of di-jet plus missing energy events. For heavier DSP but
$m_R < 70$ GeV meaningful bounds can be derived from a four jet analysis at
$\sqrt{s} = 183$ GeV. Unfortunately published searches using four jet final
states at $\sqrt{s} \simeq M_Z$ use only a small fraction of the total data
sample. Moreover, all published searches for di-jet plus missing energy final
states at $\sqrt{s} \geq 130$ GeV have poor efficiency for our model; we
therefore design new cuts that combine good background rejection with higher
efficiency. Re-analyzing the higher energy data using our new cuts, and an
analysis of the complete four jet data sample taken at $\sqrt{s}\simeq M_Z$,
can explore new regions of parameter space.

implemented in order to study the correlation between the microstructural

Knowledge obtained in model pruning is then leveraged in the development of a

numerically for a wide range of material microstructures with geometrical
characteristics of varying complexity. Unlike previous approaches that only
apply to specific material systems or require a significant amount of prior

approximation techniques to solve MDPs with large state space and/or action

approximation techniques still take much computation time to converge and
usually must be re-computed if the reward function is changed. This paper
introduces a novel alternative approach for exactly and efficiently solving
deterministic, continuous MDPs with sparse reward sources. When the environment
is such that the ""distance"" between states can be determined in constant time,
e.g. grid world, our algorithm offers $O( |R|^2 \times |A|^2 \times |S|)$,
where $|R|$ is the number of reward sources, $|A|$ is the number of actions,
and $|S|$ is the number of states. Memory complexity for the algorithm is $O(
|S| + |R| \times |A|)$. This new approach opens new avenues for boosting
computational performance for certain classes of MDPs and is of tremendous

describes the algorithm and presents numerical experiment results to

""designing toward minimalism"", where we ask ""why?"" rather than ""why not?"" in
choosing what information to display to the driver. We demonstrate this
approach on an HMI case study of displaying vehicle speed. We first show that
vehicle speed is what 87.6% of people ask for. We then show, through an online
study with 1,038 subjects and 22,950 videos, that humans can estimate
ego-vehicle speed very well, especially at lower speeds. Thus, despite
believing that we need this information, we may not. In this way, we
demonstrate a systematic approach of questioning the fundamental assumptions of
what information is essential for vehicle HMI.

  on Power Systems",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Increasing distributed energy resources (DERs) may result in reactive power
imbalance in a transmission power system (TPS). An active distribution power
system (DPS) having DERs reportedly can work as a reactive power prosumer to
help balance the reactive power in the TPS. The reactive power potential (RPP)
of a DPS, which is the range between the maximal inductive and capacitive
reactive power the DPS can reliably provide, should be accurately estimated.
However, an accurate estimation is difficult because of the network
constraints, mixed discrete and continuous variables, and the nonnegligible
uncertainty in the DPS. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a robust RPP
estimation method based on two-stage robust optimization, where the uncertainty
in DERs and the boundary-bus voltage is considered. In this two-stage robust
model, the RPP is pre-estimated in the first stage and its robust feasibility
for any possible instance of the uncertainty is checked via a tractable problem
in the second stage. The column-and-constraint generation algorithm is adopted,
which solves this model in finite iterations. Case studies show that this
robust method excels in yielding a completely reliable RPP, and also that a
DPS, even under the uncertainty, is still an effective reactive power prosumer
for the TPS.

the main storage medium in datacenters for hot data. However, flash endurance

  In this paper we propose extending flash lifetime by allowing devices to

recover from bit corruption errors with minimal performance and recovery
overhead. In doing so, DIRECT can significantly extend the lifetime of flash
devices by effectively utilizing these devices even after they begin exposing
bit errors.
  We implemented DIRECT on two real-world storage systems: ZippyDB, a
distributed key-value store backed by RocksDB, and HDFS, a distributed file
system. When tested on production traces at Facebook, DIRECT reduces
application-visible error rates in ZippyDB by more than 10^2 and recovery time

reduction tend to lose important microstructural information. In this work, we
present a deep adversarial learning methodology that overcomes the limitations
of existing MCR techniques. In the proposed methodology, generative adversarial
networks (GAN) are trained to learn the mapping between latent variables and
microstructures. Thereafter, the low-dimensional latent variables serve as
design variables, and a Bayesian optimization framework is applied to obtain
microstructures with desired material property. Due to the special design of
the network architecture, the proposed methodology is able to identify the
latent (design) variables with desired dimensionality, as well as minimize the
information loss even for complex material microstructures. The validity of the
proposed methodology is tested numerically on a synthetic microstructure
dataset and its effectiveness for materials design is evaluated through a case
study of optimizing optical performance for energy absorption. In addition, the
scalability and transferability of proposed methodology are also demonstrated

approaches: generating a trailer for a video or fast-forwarding while
watching/processing the video. The first group is supported by video
summarization techniques, which require processing of the entire video to
select an important subset for showing to users. In the second group, current
fast-forwarding methods depend on either manual control or automatic adaptation
of playback speed, which often do not present an accurate representation and
may still require processing of every frame. In this paper, we introduce
FastForwardNet (FFNet), a reinforcement learning agent that gets inspiration
from video summarization and does fast-forwarding differently. It is an online
framework that automatically fast-forwards a video and presents a
representative subset of frames to users on the fly. It does not require
processing the entire video, but just the portion that is selected by the
fast-forward agent, which makes the process very computationally efficient. The
online nature of our proposed method also enables the users to begin
fast-forwarding at any point of the video. Experiments on two real-world
datasets demonstrate that our method can provide better representation of the

modalities is a crucial task as it can be utilized for computer-aided

recent advances in deep learning, several deep neural networks for medical
image segmentation have been introduced successfully for this purpose. In this
paper, we focus on learning a deep multi-organ segmentation network that labels
voxels. In particular, we examine the critical choice of a loss function in
order to handle the notorious imbalance problem that plagues both the input and
output of a learning model. The input imbalance refers to the class-imbalance
in the input training samples (i.e., small foreground objects embedded in an
abundance of background voxels, as well as organs of varying sizes). The output
imbalance refers to the imbalance between the false positives and false
negatives of the inference model. In order to tackle both types of imbalance
during training and inference, we introduce a new curriculum learning based
loss function. Specifically, we leverage Dice similarity coefficient to deter
model parameters from being held at bad local minima and at the same time
gradually learn better model parameters by penalizing for false
positives/negatives using a cross entropy term. We evaluated the proposed loss
function on three datasets: whole body positron emission tomography (PET) scans
with 5 target organs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prostate scans, and
ultrasound echocardigraphy images with a single target organ i.e., left
ventricular. We show that a simple network architecture with the proposed
integrative loss function can outperform state-of-the-art methods and results
of the competing methods can be improved when our proposed loss is used.

edge of this classical N2-CO2-H2O HZ extends out to nearly 1.7 AU in our solar
system, beyond which condensation and scattering by CO2 outstrip its greenhouse
capacity. We use a single column radiative-convective climate model to assess
the greenhouse effect of CH4 (10 to about 100,000 ppm) on the classical
habitable zone (N2-CO2-H2O) for main-sequence stars with stellar temperatures
between 2,600 to 10,000 K (about A3 to M8). Assuming N2-CO2-H2O atmospheres,
previous studies have shown that cooler stars more effectively heat terrestrial
planets. However, we find that the addition of CH4 produces net greenhouse
warming (tens of degrees) in planets orbiting stars hotter than a mid-K (about
4500K), whereas a prominent anti-greenhouse effect is noted for planets around
cooler stars. We show that 10% CH4 can increase the width of the classical HZ
of the hottest stars (TEFF = 10,000 K) by over 20%. In contrast, the CH4
anti-greenhouse can shrink the HZ for the coolest stars (TEFF = 2,600 K) by a
similar percentage. We find that dense CO2-CH4 atmospheres near the outer edge
of hotter stars may suggest inhabitance, highlighting the importance of
including secondary greenhouse gases in alternative definitions of the HZ. We
parameterize the limits of this N2-CO2-H2O-CH4 habitable zone and discuss
implications in the search for extraterrestrial life.

multiprocessors. The proposed accelerator can simultaneously process data from
different applications with diverse types of operational functions, and it
allows multiple kernels to directly access flash without the assistance of a
host-level file system or an I/O runtime library. We prototype FlashAbacus on a
multicore-based PCIe platform that connects to FPGA-based flash controllers
with a 20 nm node process. The evaluation results show that FlashAbacus can
improve the bandwidth of data processing by 127%, while reducing energy
consumption by 78.4%, as compared to a conventional method of heterogeneous
computing. \blfootnote{This paper is accepted by and will be published at 2018

This study demonstrates that just as in related incommensurate CDW systems,

$2H$-TaS$_2$ is localized along the K-centered Fermi surface barrels and is
particle-hole asymmetric. The persistence of $\Delta_{\text{cdw}}\,$ even at
temperatures higher than the CDW transition temperature $\it{T}_{\text{cdw}}\,$
in $2H$-TaS$_2$, reflects the similar pseudogap (PG) behavior observed
previously in $2H$-TaSe$_2$ and $2H$-NbSe$_2$. However, in sharp contrast to
$2H$-NbSe$_2$, where $\Delta_{\text{cdw}}\,$ is non-zero only in the vicinity
of a few ""hot spots"" on the inner K-centered Fermi surface barrels,
$\Delta_{\text{cdw}}\,$ in $2H$-TaS$_2$ is non-zero along the entirety of both

this dichotomy in the momentum dependence and the Fermi surface specificity of
$\Delta_{\text{cdw}}\,$ between otherwise similar CDW compounds to the
different orbital orientations of their electronic states that are involved in
CDW pairing. Our results suggest that the orbital selectivity plays a critical
role in the description of incommensurate CDW materials.

brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Various extended methods have been
developed, and among such methods, a combination method of CCA and
individual-template-based CCA (IT-CCA) has achieved excellent performance.
However, CCA requires the canonical vectors to be orthogonal, which may not be
a reasonable assumption for EEG analysis. In the current study, we propose
using the correlated component analysis (CORRCA) rather than CCA to implement
frequency recognition. CORRCA can relax the constraint of canonical vectors in
CCA, and generate the same projection vector for two multichannel EEG signals.
Furthermore, we propose a two-stage method based on the basic CORRCA method
(termed TSCORRCA). Evaluated on a benchmark dataset of thirty-five subjects,
the experimental results demonstrate that CORRCA significantly outperformed
CCA, and TSCORRCA obtained the best performance among the compared methods.
This study demonstrates that CORRCA-based methods have great potential for
implementing high-performance SSVEP-based BCI systems.

feedback. In Web image search a different type of search result presentation is
used than in general Web search, which leads to different interaction
mechanisms and user behavior. For example, image search results are
self-contained, so that users do not need to click the results to view the
landing page as in general Web search, which generates sparse click data. Also,
two-dimensional result placement instead of a linear result list makes browsing
behaviors more complex. Thus, it is hard to apply standard user behavior models
(e.g., click models) developed for general Web search to Web image search.
  In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive image search user behavior analysis
using data from a lab-based user study as well as data from a commercial search
log. We then propose a novel interaction behavior model, called grid-based user
browsing model (GUBM), whose design is motivated by observations from our data
analysis. GUBM can both capture users' interaction behavior, including cursor
hovering, and alleviate position bias. The advantages of GUBM are two-fold: (1)
It is based on an unsupervised learning method and does not need manually
annotated data for training. (2) It is based on user interaction features on
search engine result pages (SERPs) and is easily transferable to other
scenarios that have a grid-based interface such as video search engines. We
conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of our model using a
large-scale commercial image search log. Experimental results show that in
terms of behavior prediction (perplexity), and topical relevance and image
quality (normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG)), GUBM outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models as well as the original ranking. We make the

maximizing the coupling between particles and their bound states, the main
problem appears to be to find what other functional can be used to define this

that it resides at a vertex of the convex space determined by the unitarity and
crossing constraints. Thus, the integrable model can be found by maximizing any
linear functional whose gradient points in the general direction of the vertex,
namely within a cone determined by the normals to the faces intersecting at the
vertex. This is a standard problem in applied mathematics, related to
semi-definite programming and solvable by fast available numerical algorithms.
The information provided by the numerical solution is enough to reproduce the
known analytical solution without using integrability, namely the Yang-Baxter

perturbation of the free operator $H_0$, where $(H_0u)(n)= u({n+1})+u({n-1})$.
For $H_0$ (no perturbation), $\sigma_{\rm ess}(H_0)=\sigma_{\rm ac}(H)=[-2,2]$

  It is an interesting and important problem to identify the perturbation such

and recovering data retention errors in multi-level cell (MLC) NAND flash
memory, which was published in HPCA 2015, and examines the work's significance
and future potential. Retention errors, caused by charge leakage over time, are
the dominant source of flash memory errors. Understanding, characterizing, and
reducing retention errors can significantly improve NAND flash memory
reliability and endurance. In this work, we first characterize, with real 2Y-nm
MLC NAND flash chips, how the threshold voltage distribution of flash memory
changes with different retention ages -- the length of time since a flash cell
was programmed. We observe from our characterization results that 1) the
optimal read reference voltage of a flash cell, using which the data can be
read with the lowest raw bit error rate (RBER), systematically changes with its
retention age, and 2) different regions of flash memory can have different
retention ages, and hence different optimal read reference voltages.
  Based on our findings, we propose two new techniques. First, Retention
Optimized Reading (ROR) adaptively learns and applies the optimal read
reference voltage for each flash memory block online. The key idea of ROR is to
periodically learn a tight upper bound of the optimal read reference voltage,
and from there approach the optimal read reference voltage. Our evaluations
show that ROR can extend flash memory lifetime by 64% and reduce average error
correction latency by 10.1%. Second, Retention Failure Recovery (RFR) recovers
data with uncorrectable errors offline by identifying and probabilistically
correcting flash cells with retention errors. Our evaluation shows that RFR
essentially doubles the error correction capability.

database issue.
  We studied how an unevenly distributed binary variable can compromise the
integrity of fixed and random effects Cox proportional hazards models.
  We compared fixed effect and random effects Cox proportional hazards models
on a set of simulated datasets inspired by a 17-trial pooled database of
patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and
non-STEMI undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.
  An unevenly distributed covariate can bias hazard ratio estimates, inflate
standard errors, raise type I error, and reduce power. While uneveness causes
problems for all Cox proportional hazards models, random effects suffer least.
Compared to fixed effect models, random effects suffer lower bias and trade
inflated type I errors for improved power. Contrasting hazard rates between
trials prevent accurate estimates from both fixed and random effects models.
  When modeling a covariate unevenly distributed across pooled trials with
similar baseline hazard rates, Cox proportional hazards models with a random
trial effect more accurately estimate hazard ratios than fixed effects.
Differing between-trial baseline hazard rates bias both random and fixed effect
models. With an unevenly-distributed covariate and similar baseline hazard
rates across trials, a random effects Cox proportional hazards model
outperforms a fixed effect model, but cannot overcome contrasting baseline
hazard rates.

is seen by the pulse as an effective (homogenized) medium, the energy is
specularly reflected and the backscattered signal vanishes in a first order

corrections to leading order terms, and we focus in this work on the

patients from low dimension features, which are extracted from an autoencoder.
Through the result of experiments, the extracted features are a useful
representation to describe and rebuild plantar pressure images. According to
N2RPP's results, we find out that there are several noteworthy differences
between normal people and patients. This can provide doctors a rough direction
of adjusting plantar pressure to a better distribution to reduce patients' sore

  Generalized Method of Moments","48 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables",,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many statistical models seek relationship between variables via subspaces of
reduced dimensions. For instance, in factor models, variables are roughly
distributed around a low dimensional subspace determined by the loading matrix;
in mixed linear regression models, the coefficient vectors for different
mixtures form a subspace that captures all regression functions; in multiple
index models, the effect of covariates is summarized by the effective dimension
reduction space.
  Such subspaces are typically unknown, and good estimates are crucial for data
visualization, dimension reduction, diagnostics and estimation of unknown
parameters. Usually, we can estimate these subspaces by computing moments from
data. Often, there are many ways to estimate a subspace, by using moments of
different orders, transformed moments, etc. A natural question is: how can we
combine all these moment conditions and achieve optimality for subspace
estimation?
  In this paper, we formulate our problem as estimation of an unknown subspace
$\mathcal{S}$ of dimension $r$, given a set of overidentifying vectors $\{
\mathrm{\bf v}_\ell \}_{\ell=1}^m$ (namely $m \ge r$) that satisfy $\mathbb{E}
\mathrm{\bf v}_{\ell} \in \mathcal{S}$ and have the form $$ \mathrm{\bf v}_\ell
= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{\bf f}_\ell(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i), $$ where
data are i.i.d. and each function $\mathrm{\bf f}_\ell$ is known. By exploiting
certain covariance information related to $\mathrm{\bf v}_\ell$, our estimator
of $\mathcal{S}$ uses an optimal weighting matrix and achieves the smallest
asymptotic error, in terms of canonical angles. The analysis is based on the
generalized method of moments that is tailored to our problem. Our method is
applied to aforementioned models and distributed estimation of heterogeneous
datasets, and may be potentially extended to analyze matrix completion, neural
nets, among others.

series of ""tunable GMM kernels"" which are simple and perform largely comparably
to tree methods on the same datasets. Note that ""abc-robust-logitboost""
substantially improved the original ""GDBT"" in that (a) it developed a
tree-split formula based on second-order information of the derivatives of the

  In the prior study in 2017, the ""generalized min-max"" (GMM) kernel was shown
to have good performance compared to the ""radial-basis function"" (RBF) kernel.
However, as demonstrated in this paper, the original GMM kernel is often not as
competitive as tree methods on the datasets used in the deep learning
literature. Since the original GMM kernel has no parameters, we propose tunable
GMM kernels by adding tuning parameters in various ways. Three basic (i.e.,
with only one parameter) GMM kernels are the ""$e$GMM kernel"", ""$p$GMM kernel"",

are able to produce good results for a large number of classification tasks.

The logical interdependence between the different topics is captured by a
`logic' matrix, which is distinct from the Laplacian matrix capturing

reduce the rate of interaction between individuals exchanging opinions. By
placing further restrictions on the logic matrix, we also establish a set of

the curvature dependence can be qualitatively estimated using Tolman's formula.
The correction from the contact angle dependence can be estimated for
nanometer-scale droplets for which the analytical formula for the intrinsic
line tension determined from the van der Waals interaction is available. The
two corrections to the apparent line tension of this van der Waals
nano-droplets are as small as nN, and lead to either a positive or a negative
apparent line tension. The gravitational line tension for millimeter-scale
droplets by the gravitational acceleration is also considered. The
gravitational line tension is of the order of $\mu$N so that the correction
from the curvature dependence can be neglected. Yet, the contact angle
dependence is so large that the apparent line tension becomes always negative
though the intrinsic line tension without the correction is always positive.
These two examples demonstrate clear distinction between the theoretical
calculated intrinsic line tension and the experimentally determined apparent
line tension which includes these two corrections. Naive comparison of the
experimentally determined and the theoretically calculated line tension is not

$\tau_{\rm r\phi}$ and decreasing $\alpha_2$ for $\tau_{\rm\theta\phi}$. The
$\tau_{\rm\theta\phi}$ is effective in angular momentum transportation at high
latitude and outflows collimation along an axis of symmetry since it changes
polar velocity ($v_{\rm\theta}$) of the flow. The outflow emission is also
affected by the ADAF size and decreased with decreasing it. Transonic surfaces
formed for both inflows ($v_{\rm r}<0$, very close to BH) and outflows ($v_{\rm

spread function (PSF) profile and the variation of its width with wavelength

predictions based on von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n's turbulence theory. The observed PSF
radial profile can be parametrized by only two parameters, the profile's full
width at half maximum (FWHM) and a normalization of the contribution of an
empirically determined ""instrumental"" PSF. The profile shape is very similar to
the ""double gaussian plus power-law wing"" decomposition used by SDSS image
processing pipeline, but here it is successfully modeled with two free model
parameters, rather than six as in SDSS pipeline. The FWHM variation with
wavelength follows the $\lambda^{\alpha}$ power law, where $\alpha \approx-0.3$
and is correlated with the FWHM itself. The observed behavior is much better
described by von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n's turbulence theory with the outer scale
parameter in the range 5$-$100 m, than by the Kolmogorov's turbulence theory.
We also measure the temporal and angular structure functions for FWHM and
compare them to simulations and results from literature. The angular structure
function saturates at scales beyond 0.5$-$1.0 degree. The power spectrum of the
temporal behavior is found to be broadly consistent with a damped random walk
model with characteristic timescale in the range $\sim5-30$ minutes, though
data show a shallower high-frequency behavior. The latter is well fit by a
single power law with index in the range $-1.5$ to $-1.0$. A hybrid model is
likely needed to fully capture both the low-frequency and high-frequency
behavior of the temporal variations of atmospheric seeing.

classifications. The input instance is a bipartite graph G=(A U P,E), where A
is a set of applicants, P is a set of posts, and each applicant ranks its
neighbors in an order of preference, possibly involving ties. Moreover, each
vertex v in A U P has a quota q(v) denoting the maximum number of partners it
can have in any allocation of applicants to posts - referred to as a {\em
matching} in this paper. A classification for a vertex u is a collection of
subsets of neighbors of u. Each subset (class) has an upper quota denoting the
maximum number of vertices from the class that can be matched to u. The goal is
to find a matching that is optimal amongst all the feasible matchings, which
are matchings that respect quotas of all the vertices and classes.
  We consider two well-studied notions of optimality namely popularity and
rank-maximality. The notion of rank-maximality involves finding a matching in
$G$ with maximum number of rank-$1$ edges, subject to that, maximum number of
rank-2 edges and so on. We present an O(|E|^2)-time algorithm for finding a
feasible rank-maximal matching, when each classification is a laminar family.
We complement this with an NP-hardness result when classes are non-laminar even
under strict preference lists, and even when only posts have classifications,
and each applicant has a quota of one. We show an analogous dichotomy result
for computing a popular matching amongst feasible matchings (if one exists) in

combining training datasets that have been manually labeled with different

videos. Recent state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) based

(LSTM) networks. Such architectures are designed to take advantage of both
short term and long term temporal contexts, but also requires the accumulation
of a predefined number of video frames (e.g., to construct video clips for 3D
ConvNet filters, to generate enough inputs for LSTMs). For applications that
require low-latency online predictions of fast-changing action scenes, a new
action recognition system is proposed in this paper. Termed ""Weighted
Multi-Region Convolutional Neural Network"" (WMR ConvNet), the proposed system
is LSTM-free, and is based on 2D ConvNet that does not require the accumulation
of video frames for 3D ConvNet filtering. Unlike early 2D ConvNets that are
based purely on RGB frames and optical flow frames, the WMR ConvNet is designed
to simultaneously capture multiple spatial and short term temporal cues (e.g.,
human poses, occurrences of objects in the background) with both the primary
region (foreground) and secondary regions (mostly background). On both the
UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, the proposed WMR ConvNet achieves the
state-of-the-art performance among competing low-latency algorithms.
Furthermore, WMR ConvNet even outperforms the 3D ConvNet based C3D algorithm
that requires video frame accumulation. In an ablation study with the optical
flow ConvNet stream removed, the ablated WMR ConvNet nevertheless outperforms
competing algorithms.

A_He and v_alpha,p/v_A values with a smaller A_He distribution range, while the
AR and QS wind is associated with lower A_He and v_alpha,p/v_A, and a larger

two solar wind generation mechanisms, WTD and RLO, work in parallel in all

the RP and ionizing plasma components. The electron temperature and
recombination timescale of the RP component were estimated as 0.17 (0.15-0.18)

research has attempted to explain human prosocial behavior. Capraro and Rand
(Judgment and Decision Making, 13, 99-111, 2018) recently provided experimental
evidence that prosociality in anonymous, one-shot interactions (such as
Prisoner's Dilemma and Dictator Game experiments) is not driven by
outcome-based social preferences - as classically assumed - but by a
generalized morality preference for ""doing the right thing"". Here we argue that
the key experiments reported in Capraro and Rand (2018) comprise prominent
methodological confounds and open questions that bear on influential
psychological theory. Specifically, their design confounds: (i) preferences for
efficiency with self-interest; and (ii) preferences for action with preferences
for morality. Furthermore, their design fails to dissociate the preference to
do ""good"" from the preference to avoid doing ""bad"". We thus designed and
conducted a preregistered, refined and extended test of the morality preference
hypothesis (N=801). Consistent with this hypothesis, our findings indicate that
prosociality in the anonymous, one-shot Dictator Game is driven by preferences
for doing the morally right thing. Inconsistent with influential psychological
theory, however, our results suggest the preference to do ""good"" was as potent
as the preference to avoid doing ""bad"" in this case.

Fermi velocity in Weyl semimetals), effectively featuring linear wave dynamics
and maintaining its shape (both in two and three dimensions). We show that for
the considered nonlinearity, this pulse represents an exact solution of the
nonlinear Weyl (NLW) equation. Finally, we comment on the generalization of the
results to a broader class of nonlinearities and on their emerging potential
for observation in different areas of application.

on a large sample of 82 disks around low- and intermediate-mass young stars,
based on mid-infrared interferometric observations. We intend to study the
distribution of disk sizes, variability, and the silicate dust mineralogy.
Methods. Archival mid-infrared interferometric data from the MIDI instrument on
the VLTI are homogeneously reduced and calibrated. Geometric disk models are
used to fit the observations to get spatial information about the disks. An
automatic spectral decomposition pipeline is applied to analyze the shape of
the silicate feature. Results. We present the resulting data products in the
form of an atlas, containing N band correlated and total spectra, visibilities,
and differential phases. The majority of our data can be well fitted with a
continuous disk model, except for a few objects, where a gapped model gives a
better match. From the mid-infrared size--luminosity relation we find that
disks around T Tauri stars are generally colder and more extended with respect
to the stellar luminosity than disks around Herbig Ae stars. We find that in
the innermost part of the disks ($r \lesssim 1$~au) the silicate feature is
generally weaker than in the outer parts, suggesting that in the inner parts
the dust is substantially more processed. We analyze stellar multiplicity and
find that in two systems (AB Aur and HD 72106) data suggest a new companion or
asymmetric inner disk structure. We make predictions for the observability of
our objects with the upcoming MATISSE instrument, supporting the practical
preparations of future MATISSE observations of T Tauri stars.

introduced a procedure including two biological age indicators; x-ray of the
third molars and magnetic resonance imaging of the distal femoral epiphysis. In
2017 a total of 9617 males and 337 females were subjected to this procedure. No

unexpected given the claims originally made by RMV. Such unexpected results
might be caused by systematic errors and need to be analysed thoroughly. In the

consistent with the observed 2017 data for males. We find that, contrary to
some RMV claims, maturity of the femur, as observed by RMV, appears on average
well before maturity of teeth. Although results naturally contain much

in a bounded domain with no-flux boundary conditions is proved. The system
generalizes the Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto population model to an arbitrary
number of species. The diffusion matrix is neither symmetric nor positive
definite, but the system possesses a formal gradient-flow or entropy structure.
No growth conditions on the source terms are imposed. It is shown that any
renormalized solution coincides with a strong solution with the same initial
data, as long as the strong solution exists. The proof is based on the
evolution of the relative entropy modified by suitable cutoff functions.

examining the effect of a swirling core flow. Such flows are important across a
range of applications, including jet pumps, combustion chambers and aerospace
engineering. Previous studies show that swirl can increase shear layer growth
rates and, in the case of confining walls, reduce flow separation. However, the
effect of swirl on pressure loss in a confined flow is uncertain. To address
this, we develop a simplified model that approximates the axial flow profile as
a linear shear layer separating uniform-velocity core and annular streams. The
azimuthal flow profile is approximated as a solid body rotation within the core
region, and a parabolic mixing profile within the shear layer. This model shows
good agreement with computational turbulence modelling, whilst its simplicity
and low computational cost make it ideal for benchmark predictions and design
purposes. Using this model, we confirm that a swirling core is useful for
increasing shear layer growth rates, but find that it is detrimental to
pressure recovery. This has important implications for the design of diffusers
that incorporate swirling flows. We use the model to describe the slow
recirculation region that can form along the pipe axis for sufficiently large
swirl, by approximating it as a stagnant zone with zero velocity. The criteria
for the development of such a region are established in terms of the pipe
expansion angle and inflow velocity profile.

set of all left- and right-monogenic functions of the axial type in axial

address the action of the Fueter mapping on the monomials $f^{(l)}_0(z)=z^l,

arises in many applications. In each round, the player selects a
$K$-cardinality subset from $N$ candidate items, and receives a reward which is
governed by a {\it multinomial logit} (MNL) choice model considering both item
utility and substitution property among items. The player's objective is to
dynamically learn the parameters of MNL model and maximize cumulative reward
over a finite horizon $T$. This problem faces the exploration-exploitation
dilemma, and the involved combinatorial nature makes it non-trivial. In recent
years, there have developed some algorithms by exploiting specific
characteristics of the MNL model, but all of them estimate the parameters of
MNL model separately and incur a regret no better than
$\tilde{O}\big(\sqrt{NT}\big)$ which is not preferred for large candidate set
size $N$. In this paper, we consider the {\it linear utility} MNL choice model
whose item utilities are represented as linear functions of $d$-dimension item
features, and propose an algorithm, titled {\bf LUMB}, to exploit the
underlying structure. It is proven that the proposed algorithm achieves
$\tilde{O}\big(dK\sqrt{T}\big)$ regret which is free of candidate set size.
Experiments show the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

energies has established the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a
state of hot, dense nuclear matter in which quarks and gluons are not bound
into hadrons. In this state, matter behaves as a nearly inviscid fluid that
efficiently translates initial spatial anisotropies into correlated momentum
anisotropies among the produced particles, producing a common velocity field
pattern known as collective flow. In recent years, comparable momentum
anisotropies have been measured in small-system proton-proton ($p$$+$$p$) and
proton-nucleus ($p$$+$$A$) collisions, despite expectations that the volume and
lifetime of the medium produced would be too small to form a QGP. Here, we
report on the observation of elliptic and triangular flow patterns of charged
particles produced in proton-gold ($p$$+$Au), deuteron-gold ($d$$+$Au), and
helium-gold ($^3$He$+$Au) collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$~=~200 GeV. The unique combination of three distinct initial
geometries and two flow patterns provides unprecedented model discrimination.
Hydrodynamical models, which include the formation of a short-lived QGP
droplet, provide a simultaneous description of these measurements.

  Sparse Graphs",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A fundamental question that shrouds the emergence of massively parallel
computing (MPC) platforms is how can the additional power of the MPC paradigm
be leveraged to achieve faster algorithms compared to classical parallel models
such as PRAM?
  Previous research has identified the sparse graph connectivity problem as a
major obstacle to such improvement: While classical logarithmic-round PRAM
algorithms for finding connected components in any $n$-vertex graph have been
known for more than three decades, no $o(\log{n})$-round MPC algorithms are
known for this task with truly sublinear in $n$ memory per machine. This
problem arises when processing massive yet sparse graphs with $O(n)$ edges, for
which the interesting setting of parameters is $n^{1-\Omega(1)}$ memory per
machine. It is conjectured that achieving an $o(\log{n})$-round algorithm for
connectivity on general sparse graphs with $n^{1-\Omega(1)}$ per-machine memory
may not be possible, and this conjecture also forms the basis for multiple
conditional hardness results on the round complexity of other problems in the
MPC model.
  We take an opportunistic approach towards the sparse graph connectivity
problem, by designing an algorithm with improved performance guarantees in
terms of the connectivity structure of the input graph. Formally, we design an
algorithm that finds all connected components with spectral gap at least
$\lambda$ in a graph in $O(\log\log{n} + \log{(1/\lambda)})$ MPC rounds and
$n^{\Omega(1)}$ memory per machine. As such, this algorithm achieves an
exponential round reduction on sparse ""well-connected"" components (i.e.,
$\lambda \geq 1/\text{polylog}{(n)}$) using only $n^{\Omega(1)}$ memory per
machine and $\widetilde{O}(n)$ total memory, and still operates in $o(\log n)$
rounds even when $\lambda = 1/n^{o(1)}$.

state, electron-repelling magnetic presheath in which a uniform magnetic field
makes a small angle $\alpha \ll 1$ (in radians) with the wall. The presheath
characteristic thickness is the typical ion gyroradius $\rho_{\text{i}}$. The
Debye length $\lambda_{\text{D}}$ and the collisional mean free path of an ion
$\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$ satisfy the ordering $\lambda_{\text{D}} \ll
\rho_{\text{i}} \ll \alpha \lambda_{\text{mfp}}$, so a quasineutral and
collisionless model is used. We assume that the electrostatic potential is a
function only of distance from the wall, and it varies over the scale
$\rho_{\text{i}}$. Using the expansion in $\alpha \ll 1$, we derive an
analytical expression for the ion density that only depends on the ion
distribution function at the entrance of the magnetic presheath and the
electrostatic potential profile. Importantly, we have added the crucial
contribution of the orbits in the region near the wall. By imposing the
quasineutrality equation, we derive a condition that the ion distribution
function must satisfy at the magnetic presheath entrance --- the kinetic
equivalent of the Chodura condition. Using an ion distribution function at the
entrance of the magnetic presheath that satisfies the kinetic Chodura
condition, we find numerical solutions for the self-consistent electrostatic
potential, ion density and flow across the magnetic presheath for several
values of $\alpha$. Our numerical results also include the distribution of ion
velocities at the Debye sheath entrance. We find that at small values of
$\alpha$ there are substantially fewer ions travelling with a large normal
component of the velocity into the wall.

contributions to the anomalous Hall effect and the topological Hall effect,

first principle calculations to show that both Hall and Nernst effects are
enhanced in MnP and FeP due to the temperature dependent magnetic texture. At
ambient pressure the inversion breaking crystals shows a transition from a
double-spiral helimagnetic phase to a topologically trivial magnetic phase.
This helimagnetic structure is determined by exchange frustration and the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In the presence of an external magnetic
field the magnetic structure transforms into a fan-like phase with a finite
spin chirality that gives rise to an effective magnetic field on the order
$\sim$1 T. The topological Hall and Nernst effect from this field are
comparable or larger to tightly-wound skyrmion systems. Lastly, we show that
the topological effects are strongly dependent on the Fermi surface topology,
which has strong variations and even sign changes for similar magnetic
textures.

a spring scale that lies at the intersection of group testing and compressed
sensing problems. Given a collection of $n\geq 2$ coins of total weight $d$
(for a known integer $d$), where the weight of each coin is an unknown integer
in the range of $\{0,1,\dots,k\}$ (for a known integer $k\geq 1$), the problem
is to determine the weight of each coin by weighing subsets of coins in a
spring scale. The goal is to minimize the average number of weighings over all
possible weight configurations. For $d=k=1$, an adaptive bisecting weighing
strategy is known to be optimal. However, even the case of $d=k=2$, which is
the simplest non-trivial case of the problem, is still open. For this case, we
propose and analyze a simple and effective adaptive weighing strategy. A
numerical evaluation of the exact recursive formulas, derived for the analysis
of the proposed strategy, shows that this strategy requires about ${1.365\log_2
n -0.5}$ weighings on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-trivial achievable upper bound on the minimum expected required number of
weighings for the case of $d=k=2$. As $n$ grows unbounded, the proposed
strategy, when compared to an optimal strategy within the commonly-used class
of nested strategies, requires about $31.75\%$ less number of weighings on
average; and in comparison with the information-theoretic lower bound, it
requires at most about $8.16\%$ extra number of weighings on average.

experience and enable a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In
this work, we propose a new market-based framework for efficiently allocating
resources of heterogeneous capacity-limited edge nodes (EN) to multiple
competing services at the network edge. By properly pricing the geographically
distributed ENs, the proposed framework generates a market equilibrium (ME)
solution that not only maximizes the edge computing resource utilization but
also allocates optimal (i.e., utility-maximizing) resource bundles to the
services given their budget constraints. When the utility of a service is
defined as the maximum revenue that the service can achieve from its resource
allotment, the equilibrium can be computed centrally by solving the
Eisenberg-Gale (EG) convex program. drawn from the economics literature. We
further show that the equilibrium allocation is Pareto-optimal and satisfies
desired fairness properties including sharing incentive, proportionality, and
envy-freeness. Also, two distributed algorithms are introduced, which
efficiently converge to an ME. When each service aims to maximize its net
profit (i.e., revenue minus cost) instead of the revenue, we derive a novel
convex optimization problem and rigorously prove that its solution is exactly
an ME. Extensive numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed techniques.

entropy density ratios $\eta$/s(T) and $\zeta$/s(T), respectively. While the
EoS is by now known to a high accuracy, the transport coefficients and in
particular their temperature and density dependence are not well known from
first-principle computations yet, as well as the possible influence they can
have once used in hydrodynamical simulations. In this work, the most recent
QCD-based parameters are provided as input to the MUSIC framework. A ratio
$\eta$/s(T) computed with a QCD based approach is used for the first time

describe the initial energy density distribution, and UrQMD for the dilute
hadronic phase. Simulations are performed for Pb--Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, for different centrality intervals. The
resulting kinematic distributions of the particles produced in the collisions
are compared to data from the LHC, for several experimental observables. The
high precision of the experimental results and the broad variety of observables
considered allow to critically verify the quality of the description based on
first-principle input to the hydrodynamic evolution.

optimization algorithm in machine learning. Most theoretical analysis on ASGD
take a discrete view and prove upper bounds for their convergence rates.
However, the discrete view has its intrinsic limitations: there is no
characterization of the optimization path and the proof techniques are
induction-based and thus usually complicated. Inspired by the recent successful
adoptions of stochastic differential equations (SDE) to the theoretical
analysis of SGD, in this paper, we study the continuous approximation of ASGD
by using stochastic differential delay equations (SDDE). We introduce the
approximation method and study the approximation error. Then we conduct
theoretical analysis on the convergence rates of ASGD algorithm based on the
continuous approximation. There are two methods: moment estimation and energy
function minimization can be used to analyze the convergence rates. Moment
estimation depends on the specific form of the loss function, while energy
function minimization only leverages the convex property of the loss function,
and does not depend on its specific form. In addition to the convergence
analysis, the continuous view also helps us derive better convergence rates.
All of this clearly shows the advantage of taking the continuous view in

Discovering a venue by a photo is very important for context-aware

discovery from heterogeneous social multimodal data. To this end, we propose a
novel deep learning model, Category-based Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis
(C-DCCA). Given a photo as input, this model performs (i) exact venue search
(find the venue where the photo was taken), and (ii) group venue search (find
relevant venues with the same category as that of the photo), by the
cross-modal correlation between the input photo and textual description of
venues. In this model, data in different modalities are projected to a same
space via deep networks. Pairwise correlation (between different modal data
from the same venue) for exact venue search and category-based correlation
(between different modal data from different venues with the same category) for
group venue search are jointly optimized. Because a photo cannot fully reflect
rich text description of a venue, the number of photos per venue in the
training phase is increased to capture more aspects of a venue. We build a new
venue-aware multimodal dataset by integrating Wikipedia featured articles and
Foursquare venue photos. Experimental results on this dataset confirm the
feasibility of the proposed method. Moreover, the evaluation over another
publicly available dataset confirms that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-arts for cross-modal retrieval between image and text.

wavelength $2\pi/k=12.278....a$ when the pressure exceeds $2.052....\mu$. In
finite solids, the threshold pressure is reduced, and peristalsis is followed
by a second instability which shears the peristaltic shape breaking
axisymmetry. These instabilities shows that, counterintuitively, if a pipe runs

stabilizing at high pressures. They also offers a route to fabricate
periodically undulating channels, producing waveguides with photonic/phononic

how a pre-existing Keplerian disc -- like that inferred to form from decretion
of material from rapidly rotating Be stars -- can be disrupted by a
rotation-aligned stellar dipole field. For characteristic stellar and disc
parameters of a near-critically rotating B2e star, we find that a polar surface
field strength of just 10 G can significantly disrupt the disc, while a field
of 100 G, near the observational upper limit inferred for most Be stars,
completely destroys the disc over just a few days. Our parameter study shows
that the efficacy of this magnetic disruption of a disc scales with the
characteristic plasma beta {(defined as the ratio between thermal and magnetic
pressure)} in the disc, but is surprisingly insensitive to other variations,
e.g. in stellar rotation speed, or the mass loss rate of the star's radiatively
driven wind. The disc disruption seen here for even a modest field strength
suggests that the presumed formation of such Be discs by decretion of material
from the star would likely be strongly inhibited by such fields; this provides
an attractive explanation for why no large-scale fields are detected from such

positives (hard datasets). A more efficient learning strategy is required for
improving the performance of peptide identification on challenging datasets.
  Results: In this work, we present an online learning method to conquer the
challenges remained for exiting peptide identification algorithms. We propose a
cost-sensitive learning model by using different loss functions for decoy and
target PSMs respectively. A larger penalty for wrongly selecting decoy PSMs
than that for target PSMs, and thus the new model can reduce its false
discovery rate on hard datasets. Also, we design an online learning algorithm,
OLCS-Ranker, to solve the proposed learning model. Rather than taking all
training data samples all at once, OLCS-Ranker iteratively feeds in only one
training sample into the learning model at each round. As a result, the memory
requirement is significantly reduced for large-scale problems. Experimental
studies show that OLCS-Ranker outperforms benchmark methods, such as CRanker
and Batch-CS-Ranker, in terms of accuracy and stability. Furthermore,
OLCS-Ranker is 15--85 times faster than CRanker method on large datasets.

a great interest in designing various optical elements from the
deep-ultraviolet to the microwave. Normally, the OAM variation introduced by
optical elements can be attributed to two terms, namely the dynamic and
geometric phases. Up till now, the dynamic contribution induced by optical
elements has been clearly recognized. However, the contribution of geometric
phase still seems obscure, especially considering the vector vortex beams. In
this work, an analytical formula is derived to fully describe the OAM variation
introduced by the nonabsorbing optical elements, which perform space-variant
polarization-state manipulations. It is found that the geometric contribution
can be further divided into two parts: one is directly related to optical
elements and the other one explicitly relies solely on the vortices before and
after the transformations. Based on this result, the same OAM variation can be
achieved with different combinations of the dynamic and/or geometric
contributions. With numerical simulations, it is shown that transformation of
the optical vortices can be fully and flexibly designed with a family of
optical elements. We believe that these results are helpful to understand the
effect of optical elements and offer a new perspective to design the optical
elements for manipulating the OAM carried by light beams.

topological complexity induced in the coronal magnetic field, primarily using
plasma motions extracted from magneto-convection simulations. This topological
complexity is quantified using the field line winding, finite time topological
entropy and passive scalar mixing. With these measures we contrast mixing
efficiencies of the magneto-convection simulation, a benchmark flow known as a
``blinking vortex', and finally photospheric flows inferred from sequences of
observed magnetograms using local correlation tracking. While the highly
resolved magneto-convection simulations induce a strong degree of field line
winding and finite time topological entropy, the values obtained from the
observations from the plage region are around an order of magnitude smaller.
This behavior is carried over to the finite time topological entropy.
Nevertheless, the results suggest that the photospheric motions induce complex

matter, in the hope that sub-atomic local interactions stabilize the state for
sufficiently long time, thereby allowing later recovery. Motivated to explore
how temporal evolution of physical states in magnetic storage media affects
their capacity, this work initiates the study of information retention in
locally-interacting particle systems. The system dynamics follow the stochastic
Ising model (SIM) over a 2-dimensional $\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}$ grid. The
initial spin configuration $X_0$ serves as the user-controlled input. The
output configuration $X_t$ is produced by running $t$ steps of Glauber
dynamics. Our main goal is to evaluate the information capacity
$I_n(t):=\max_{p_{X_0}}I(X_0;X_t)$ when time $t$ scales with the system's size
$n$. While the positive (but low) temperature regime is our main interest, we
start by exploring the simpler zero-temperature dynamics.
  We first show that at zero temperature, order of $\sqrt{n}$ bits can be
stored in the system indefinitely by coding over stable, striped
configurations. While $\sqrt{n}$ is order optimal for infinite time, backing
off to $t<\infty$, higher orders of $I_n(t)$ are achievable. First, linear
coding arguments imply that $I_n(t) = \Theta(n)$ for $t=O(n)$. To go beyond the
linear scale, we develop a droplet-based achievability scheme that reliably
stores $\Omega\left(n/\log n\right)$ for $t=O(n\log n)$ time ($\log n$ can be
replaced with any $o(n)$ function). Moving to the positive but low temperature
regime, two main results are provided. First, we show that an initial
configuration drawn from the Gibbs measure cannot retain more than a single bit
for $t\geq \exp(C\beta n^{1/4+\epsilon})$ time. On the other hand, when scaling
time with the inverse temperature $\beta$, the stripe-based coding scheme is
shown to retain its bits for $e^{c\beta}$.

traditional computing platforms are employed in such computational hungry
executions. Spiking neuromorphic computing (SNC) has been widely investigated
in deep networks implementation own to their high efficiency in computation and
communication. However, weights and signals of DNNs are required to be
quantized when deploying the DNNs on the SNC, which results in unacceptable

On an undirected graph with
$n$ nodes and $m$ edges, $O(\log n)$ round connectivity algorithms have been
known for over 35 years. However, no algorithms with better complexity bounds
were known. In this work, we give fully scalable, faster algorithms for the
connectivity problem, by parameterizing the time complexity as a function of
the diameter of the graph. Our main result is a $O(\log D \log\log_{m/n} n)$
time connectivity algorithm for diameter-$D$ graphs, using $\Theta(m)$ total
memory. If our algorithm can use more memory, it can terminate in fewer rounds,
and there is no lower bound on the memory per processor.
  We extend our results to related graph problems such as spanning forest,
finding a DFS sequence, exact/approximate minimum spanning forest, and
bottleneck spanning forest. We also show that achieving similar bounds for
reachability in directed graphs would imply faster boolean matrix
multiplication algorithms.
  We introduce several new algorithmic ideas. We describe a general technique
called double exponential speed problem size reduction which roughly means that
if we can use total memory $N$ to reduce a problem from size $n$ to $n/k$, for
$k=(N/n)^{\Theta(1)}$ in one phase, then we can solve the problem in
$O(\log\log_{N/n} n)$ phases. In order to achieve this fast reduction for graph
connectivity, we use a multistep algorithm. One key step is a carefully
constructed truncated broadcasting scheme where each node broadcasts neighbor
sets to its neighbors in a way that limits the size of the resulting neighbor
sets. Another key step is random leader contraction, where we choose a smaller
set of leaders than many previous works do.

the considerable side reactions stemming from the chemical aggressiveness of
NaO2 both as a solid phase and dissolved species in the electrolyte. The side
reaction products cover electrode surfaces and hinder electron transfer across
the electrode-electrolyte interface, being a major reason for cell failure. In
addition, the available electrode surface and porosity change considerably
during cell discharging and charging, affecting the diffusion of soluble

when interpreting such data is to fit these averages (for instance, squared
displacements) with a function and extract parameters (such as diffusion
constants). A commonly overlooked challenge in such function fitting procedures
is that fluctuations around mean values, by construction, exhibit temporal
correlations. We show that the only available general purpose function fitting
methods, correlated chi-square method and the weighted least squares method
(which neglects correlation), fail at either robust parameter estimation or
accurate error estimation. We remedy this by deriving a new closed-form error
estimation formula for weighted least square fitting. The new formula uses the
full covariance matrix, i.e., rigorously includes temporal correlations, but is
free of the robustness issues, inherent to the correlated chi-square method. We
demonstrate its accuracy in four examples of importance in many fields:
Brownian motion, damped harmonic oscillation, fractional Brownian motion and

as a function of the oil-to-water viscosity ratio, surface tension coefficient,
contact angle, and droplet radius agree well with theoretical predictions. Our

such an effect also belongs to a quantum process. It is based on this

be established to generate and manipulate as much photonic quantum as desired.
We attributed such electrically induced lighting among liquid metal droplets
immersed inside aqueous solution as photonic quantum effect. Our experiments
clarified that a small electrical voltage would be strong enough to trigger
blue-violet light and sound inside the aqueous solution system. Meanwhile,
thermal heat is released, and chemical reaction occurs over the solution. From
an alternative way which differs from former effort in interpreting such effect
as discharge plasma, we treated this process as a quantum one and derived new
conceptual equations to theoretically quantify this phenomenon in light of
quantum mechanics principle. It can be anticipated that given specific
designing, such spontaneously generated tremendous quantum can be manipulated
to entangle together which would possibly help mold functional elements for
developing future quantum computing or communication system. With superior
adaptability than that of the conventional rigid junction, the present

enhances the signal of outer SEI layers, enabling detection of natural

Furthermore, 13C- enriched electrolytes measurements at 100K provide ample
sensitivity without DNP due to the vast amount of SEI filling the rGO pores,

Developing this approach further will benefit the study of many electrode

difficulty in achieving the high theoretical capacity have been major issues

address the above issues by exploring the synergistic effect of
2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4- benzoquinone and H2O on the oxygen chemistry in a
non-aqueous Li-O2 battery. Water stabilizes the quinone monoanion and dianion,
shifting the reduction potentials of the quinone and monoanion to more positive
values (vs. Li+). When water and the quinone are used together in a (largely)
non-aqueous Li-O2 battery, the cell discharge operates via a two-electron
oxygen reduction reaction to form Li2O2, the battery discharge voltage, rate,
capacity all being considerably increased and fewer side reactions being
detected; Li2O2 crystals can grow up to 30 um, more than an order of magnitude
larger than cases with the quinone alone or without any additives, suggesting
that water is essential to promoting a solution dominated process with the
quinone on discharging. The catalytic reduction of O2 by the quinone monoanion
is predominantly responsible for the attractive features mentioned above. Water
stabilizes the quinone monoanion via hydrogen bond formation and by
coordination of the Li+ ions, and it also helps increase the solvation,
concentration, life time and diffusion length of reduced oxygen species that
dictate the discharge voltage, rate and capacity of the battery. When a redox
mediator is also used to aid the charging process, a high-power, high energy-
density, rechargeable Li-O2 battery is obtained.

achieve an objective and its adversary seeks to learn the agent's intentions
and prevent the agent from achieving its objective. The agent has an incentive
to try to deceive the adversary about its intentions, while at the same time
working to achieve its objective. The primary contribution of this paper is to
introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for the notion of deception
within the context of optimal control. The central notion introduced in the
paper is that of a belief-induced reward: a reward dependent not only on the
agent's state and action, but also adversary's beliefs. Design of an optimal
deceptive strategy then becomes a question of optimal control design on the
product of the agent's state space and the adversary's belief space. The
proposed framework allows for deception to be defined in an arbitrary control
system endowed with a reward function, as well as with additional
specifications limiting the agent's control policy. In addition to defining
deception, we discuss design of optimally deceptive strategies under
uncertainties in agent's knowledge about the adversary's learning process. In
the latter part of the paper, we focus on a setting where the agent's behavior
is governed by a Markov decision process, and show that the design of optimally
deceptive strategies under lack of knowledge about the adversary naturally
reduces to previously discussed problems in control design on partially
observable or uncertain Markov decision processes. Finally, we present two
examples of deceptive strategies: a ""cops and robbers"" scenario and an example
where an agent may use camouflage while moving. We show that optimally
deceptive strategies in such examples follow the intuitive idea of how to
deceive an adversary in the above settings.

PN populations out to 95 kpc radius, and employ a multi-Gaussian model for the
velocity distribution to identify stellar populations with distinct kinematics
and histories. We report the detection of stellar-kinematic substructure
associated with the interaction of M49 with the dwarf irregular galaxy VCC
1249. We find two kinematically distinct PN populations associated with the
main M49 halo and the extended intra-group light (IGL). These have velocity
dispersions $\sigma_{halo}\simeq 170$ km/s and $\sigma_{IGL} \simeq400$ km/s at
10-80 kpc radii. The overall luminosity profile and velocity dispersion at
$\sim80$ kpc are consistent with a flat circular velocity curve extrapolated
from X-ray observations. The dispersion of the PNe associated with the IGL
joins onto that of the satellite galaxies in subcluster B at $\sim100$ kpc
radius. This is the first time that the transition from halo to IGL is observed
based on the velocities of individual stars. Therefore the halo of M49,
consisting of at least three distinct components, has undergone an extended
accretion history within its parent group potential. The blue colours of the
IGL component are consistent with a population of stars formed in low-mass
galaxies at redshift $\sim0.5$ that has since evolved passively, as suggested
by other data.

'activated' ECs, that are obtained from the 'pristine' ECs by means of a
suitable activation process (A) aimed at improving the performance in the ORR.
Here is clarified the interplay existent between: (i) the chemical composition,

fundamental understanding of this family of ECs and open the door to the
devising of new preparations of 'Pt-free' ECs for the ORR, which: (i) are

robotic limb by utilizing the recent history of EMG signals in a model that
accounts for physiological features of hand movement which are ignored by PR
algorithms. We do this by viewing EMG signals as functional covariates and
develop a functional linear model that quantifies the effect of the EMG signals
on finger/wrist velocity through a bivariate coefficient function that is
allowed to vary with current finger/wrist position. The model is made par-
simonious and interpretable through a two-step variable selection procedure,
called Sequential Adaptive Functional Empirical group LASSO (SAFE-gLASSO).
Numerical studies show excel- lent selection and prediction properties of
SAFE-gLASSO compared to popular alternatives. For our motivating dataset, the
method correctly identifies the few EMG signals that are known to be important
for an able-bodied subject with negligible false positives and the model can be
directly implemented in a robotic prosthetic.

resolve the spectral features of the atomic sodium (Na I) doublet and the
H$\alpha$ line in its atmosphere, measuring absorption depths of
0.17$\pm$0.03$\%$ and 0.59$\pm$0.08$\%$ for a 0.75 $\AA$ passband,
respectively. These absorptions are corroborated with the transmission measured
from their respective transmission light curves, which show a large
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. In case of H$\alpha$, this absorption corresponds
to an effective radius of $R_{\lambda}/R_P$=1.20$\pm$0.04. While the S/N of the
final transmission spectrum is not sufficient to adjust different temperature
profiles to the lines, we find that higher temperatures than the equilibrium
are needed to explain the lines contrast. Particularly, we find that the Na I
lines core require a temperature of T=4210$\pm$180K and that H$\alpha$ requires
T=4330$\pm$520K. MASCARA-2b, like other planets orbiting A-type stars, receives
a large amount of UV energy from its host star. This energy excites the atomic
hydrogen and produces H$\alpha$ absorption, leading to the expansion and
abrasion of the atmosphere. The study of other Balmer lines in the transmission
spectrum would allow the determination of the atmospheric temperature profile
and the calculation of the lifetime of the atmosphere. In the case of
MASCARA-2b, residual features are observed in the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ lines,
but they are not statistically significant. More transit observations are
needed to confirm our findings in Na I and H$\alpha$, and to build up enough
S/N to explore the presence of H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ planetary absorptions.

facilities are {\em unknown}, and only the ordinal preferences of the agents
for the facilities are available. The main difference between our work and
previous work in this area is that while we assume that only ordinal
information about agent preferences in known, we know the exact locations of
the possible facilities $\mathcal{F}$. Due to this extra information about the
facilities, we are able to form powerful algorithms which have small {\em
distortion}, i.e., perform almost as well as omniscient algorithms but use only
ordinal information about agent preferences. For example, we present natural
social choice mechanisms for choosing a single facility to open with distortion
of at most 3 for minimizing both the total and the median social cost; this
factor is provably the best possible. We analyze many general problems
including matching, $k$-center, and $k$-median, and present black-box
reductions from omniscient approximation algorithms with approximation factor
$\beta$ to ordinal algorithms with approximation factor $1+2\beta$; doing this
gives new ordinal algorithms for many important problems, and establishes a

model based on predictive processing that enables any multisensory robot to
learn, infer and update its body configuration when using arbitrary sensors
with Gaussian additive noise. The proposed method integrates different sources
of information (tactile, visual and proprioceptive) to drive the robot belief
to its current body configuration. The motivation is to enable robots with the
embodied perception needed for self-calibration and safe physical human-robot

process regression. We model body estimation as minimizing the discrepancy
between the robot body configuration belief and the observed posterior. We
minimize the variational free energy using the sensory prediction errors
(sensed vs expected).
  In order to evaluate the model we test it on a real multisensory robotic arm.
We show how different sensor modalities contributions, included as additive
errors, improve the refinement of the body estimation and how the system adapts
itself to provide the most plausible solution even when injecting strong
sensory visuo-tactile perturbations. We further analyse the reliability of the
model when different sensor modalities are disabled. This provides grounded
evidence about the correctness of the perceptual model and shows how the robot
estimates and adjusts its body configuration just by means of sensory

received little attention in the literature, since their associated texture
pixels are occluded in the synthesized view and their effect on the synthesized

still need to consume the bits to be transmitted, and will induce geometry
distortion that inherently exists in the synthesized view. In this paper, we
propose an efficient depth map coding scheme specifically for the
occlusion-inducing depth pixels by using allowable depth distortions. Firstly,
we formulate a problem of minimizing the overall geometry distortion in the
occlusion subject to the bit rate constraint, for which the depth distortion is
properly adjusted within the set of allowable depth distortions that introduce
the same disparity error as the initial depth distortion. Then, we propose a
dynamic programming solution to find the optimal depth distortion vector for
the occlusion. The proposed algorithm can improve the coding efficiency without
alteration of the occlusion order. Simulation results confirm the performance

more than 2 Ms of $\textit{Chandra}$ observations. The X-ray jets are
misaligned with the radio jets and significantly wider. We detect non-thermal
emission components in both lobes and jets. For the eastern lobe and jet, we
find 1 keV flux densities of $71_{-10}^{+10}$ nJy and $24_{-4}^{+4}$ nJy, and
photon indices of $1.72_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$ and $1.64_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$
respectively. For the western lobe and jet, we find flux densities of
$50_{-13}^{+12}$ nJy and $13_{-5}^{+5}$ nJy, and photon indices of
$1.97_{-0.10}^{+0.23}$ and $1.86_{-0.12}^{+0.18}$ respectively. Using these
results, we modeled the electron energy distributions of the lobes as broken
power laws with age breaks. We find that a significant population of
non-radiating particles is required to account for the total pressure of the
eastern lobe. In the western lobe, no such population is required and the low
energy cutoff to the electron distribution there needs to be raised to obtain
pressures consistent with observations. This discrepancy is a consequence of
the differing X-ray photon indices, which may indicate that the turnover in the
inverse-Compton spectrum of the western lobe is at lower energies than in the
eastern lobe. We modeled the emission from both jets as inverse-Compton
emission. There is a narrow region of parameter space for which the X-ray jet
can be a relic of an earlier active phase, although lack of knowledge about the
jet's electron distribution and particle content makes the modelling uncertain.

wireless multiple access network with an unknown finite number of homogeneous
transmitters. An enhanced physical link layer interface is considered where
each link layer user can be equipped with multiple transmission options. Assume
that each user is backlogged with a saturated message queue. With a
generally-modeled channel, a distributed medium access control framework is
suggested to adapt the transmission scheme of each user to maximize an
arbitrarily chosen symmetric network utility. The proposed framework suggests
that the receiver should measure the success probability of a carefully
designed virtual packet, and feed such information back to the transmitters.
Upon receiving the measured probability, each transmitter should obtain a user
number estimate by comparing the probability with its theoretical value, and
then adapt its transmission scheme accordingly. Conditions under which the
proposed algorithm should converge to a designed unique equilibrium are
characterized. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the optimality

direct laboratory observation of vacuum magnetic birefringence, an effect due

birefringence of vacuum is $\Delta n = 4.0\times 10^{-24}$ @ 1~T. One of the
key ingredients when designing a polarimeter capable of detecting such a small
birefringence is a long optical path length within the magnetic field and a
time dependent effect. To lengthen the optical path within the magnetic field a
Fabry-Perot optical cavity is generally used with a finesse ranging from ${\cal
F} \approx 10^4$ to ${\cal F} \approx7\times 10^5$. Interestingly, there is a
difficulty in reaching the predicted shot noise limit of such polarimeters. We
have measured the ellipticity and rotation noises along with a Cotton-Mouton
and a Faraday effect as a function of the finesse of the cavity of the PVLAS
polarimeter. The observations are consistent with the idea that the cavity
mirrors generate a birefringence-dominated noise whose ellipticity is amplified
by the cavity itself. The optical path difference sensitivity at $10\;$Hz is
$S_{\Delta{\cal D}}=6\times 10^{-19}\;$m$/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$, a value which we

research fields emerge, grow and decline over time and space. This study
confronts this question here by developing an inductive analysis of emerging
research fields represented by human microbiome, evolutionary robotics and
astrobiology. In particular, number of papers from starting years to 2017 of
each emerging research field is analyzed considering the subject areas (i.e.,
disciplines) of authors. Findings suggest some empirical laws of the evolution
of research fields: the first law states that the evolution of a specific
research field is driven by few scientific disciplines (3- 5) that generate
more than 80% of documents (concentration of the scientific production); the
second law states that the evolution of research fields is path-dependent of a
critical discipline (it can be a native discipline that has originated the
research field or a new discipline emerged during the social dynamics of
science); the third law states that a research field can be driven during its
evolution by a new discipline originated by a process of specialization within
science. The findings here can explain and generalize, whenever possible some
properties of the evolution of scientific fields that are due to interaction
between disciplines, convergence between basic and applied research fields and
interdisciplinary in scientific research. Overall, then, this study begins the
process of clarifying and generalizing, as far as possible, the properties of
the social construction and evolution of science to lay a foundation for the
development of sophisticated theories.

any actual computation. RowClone exploits the organization and operation of
commodity DRAM to perform these operations completely inside DRAM using two
mechanisms. The first mechanism, Fast Parallel Mode, copies data between two
rows inside the same DRAM subarray by issuing back-to-back activate commands to
the source and the destination row. The second mechanism, Pipelined Serial

RowClone significantly reduces the raw latency and energy consumption of bulk

In that context, the functional and non-functional monitoring of these networks

wired networks using gossip-based or hierarchical-based approaches. However,
when applied to a MANET, several problematics arise mainly due to the absence
of a centralized administration, the inherent MANETs constraints and the nodes
mobility. In this paper, we present a hybrid distributed monitoring
architecture for mobile adhoc networks in context of mobility pattern. We get
inspired of gossip-based and hierarchical-based algorithms for query
dissemination and data aggregation. We define gossip-based mechanisms that help
our virtual hierarchical topology to complete the data aggregation, and then
ensure the stability and robustness of our approach in dynamic environments.
Further, we propose a fully distributed monitoring protocol that ease the nodes

number of coexisting species, also with few or limited number of resources.
These ecosystems are characterized by multiple type of interactions, in
particular displaying cooperative behaviors. However, standard modeling of
population dynamics based on Lotka-Volterra type of equations predicts that
ecosystem stability should decrease as the number of species in the community
increases and that cooperative systems are less stable than communities with
only competitive and/or exploitative interactions. Here we propose a stochastic
model of population dynamics, which includes exploitative interactions as well
as cooperative interactions induced by cross-feeding. The model is exactly
solved and we obtain results for relevant macro-ecological patterns, such as
species abundance distributions and correlation functions. In the large system
size limit, any number of species can coexist for a very general class of
interaction networks and stability increases as the number of species grows.
For pure mutualistic/commensalistic interactions we determine the topological
properties of the network that guarantee species coexistence. We also show that
the stationary state is globally stable and that inferring species interactions
through species abundance correlation analysis may be misleading. Our
theoretical approach thus show that appropriate models of cooperation naturally
leads to a solution of the long-standing question about complexity-stability
paradox and on how highly biodiverse communities can coexist.

quantify the necessary and sufficient budgets to achieve the detection

types of algorithms: adaptive and non-adaptive ones, each of which corresponds
to whether we adaptively select the next respondents based on the answers of

lower bounds for the necessary budgets in both algorithm types. In terms of the
sufficient budgets, we propose two practical estimation algorithms, each of
non-adaptive and adaptive types, and for each algorithm, we quantitatively
analyze the budget which ensures $1-\delta$ detection accuracy. This
theoretical analysis not only quantifies the budgets needed by practical
estimation algorithms achieving a given target detection accuracy in finding
the diffusion source, but also enables us to quantitatively characterize the

admits four independent Killing vectors. The Finslerian Ressiner-Nordstrom

operator of ""Finslerian sphere"", namely, a special subspace with positive

$\bar{Y}_l^m=Y_l^m+\epsilon^2(C_{l+2}^m Y_{l+2}^m+C_{l-2}^m Y_{l-2}^m)$ in
powers of Finslerian parameter $\epsilon$, where $C_{l+2}^m$ and $C_{l-2}^m$

eigenvalues corresponded to $Y_1^0$ remain the same with Riemannian Laplace

fact just reflect the symmetry of ""Finslerian sphere"", which admits a $z$-axis

out the cosmic evolution scientists ever tried to modify Einstein's
gravitational theory and its unexplored parts. We also look forward to address
the same problem with a different approach based on interaction between matter
and geometry. For this purpose we consider $f(R,T,Q)$ modified theory (where
$R$ is the Ricci Scalar, $T$ is the trace of energy-momentum tensor (EMT)

In this formalism energy density is found using covariant divergence of
modified field equations. $\rho$ involves a contribution from non-minimal
matter geometry coupling which helps to study different cosmic eras based on
equation of state (EOS). Furthermore, we apply the energy bounds to constrain

acceleration mechanisms can shape the spectra in specific ways, especially at
high radio frequencies. These features are connected to the age and the
peculiar conditions of the local interstellar medium interacting with the SNR.
Whereas the bulk radio emission is expected at up to $20-50$ GHz, sensitive
high-resolution images of SNRs above 10 GHz are lacking and are not easily
achievable, especially in the confused regions of the Galactic Plane. In the
framework of the early science observations with the Sardinia Radio Telescope

maximum energy of the accelerated electrons in the range $6-13$ GeV, in
agreement with predictions indirectly derived from AGILE and \textit{Fermi}-LAT

institutions. With some prescience, the radiobiology community has established
data sharing infrastructures over the last two decades, including STORE;
however, the utilisation of these databases is disappointing. The aim of the
present study was to identify the current state of datasharing amongst
researchers in radiation protection, and to identify barriers to effective
sharing. An electronic survey was prepared, including questions on
post-publication data provision, institutional, funding agency, and journal
policies, awareness of datasharing infrastructures, attitudinal barriers, and
technical support. The survey was sent to the members of a mailing list
maintained by the EC funded CONCERT project. Responses identified that the
radiation protection community shared similar concerns to other groups
canvassed in earlier studies; the perceived negative impact of datasharing on
competitiveness, career development and reputation, along with concern about
the costs of data management. More surprising was the lack of awareness of
existing datasharing platforms. We find that there is a clear need for
education and training in data management and for a significant programme of
improving awareness of Open Data issues.

domains. However, they are traditionally deployed with applications embedded in
them which precludes their re-use for new applications. Nowadays,
virtualization enables several applications on a same WSN by abstracting the
physical resources (i.e. sensing capabilities) into logical ones. However, this
comes at a cost, including an energy cost. It is therefore critical to ensure
the efficient allocation of these resources. In this paper, we study the
problem of assigning application sensing tasks to sensor devices, in
virtualized WSNs. Our goal is to minimize the overall energy consumption
resulting from the assignment. We focus on the static version of the problem
and formulate it using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), while accounting for
sensor nodes' available energy and virtualization overhead. We solve the
problem over different scenarios and compare the obtained solution to the case
of a traditional WSN, i.e. one with no support for virtualization. Our results
show that significant energy can be saved when tasks are appropriately assigned
in a WSN that supports virtualization.

  Earth",,,,"stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Region-based classification of PolSAR data can be effectively performed by
seeking for the assignment that minimizes a distance between prototypes and
segments. Silva et al (2013) used stochastic distances between complex
multivariate Wishart models which, differently from other measures, are
computationally tractable. In this work we assess the robustness of such
approach with respect to errors in the training stage, and propose an extension
that alleviates such problems. We introduce robustness in the process by
incorporating a combination of radial basis kernel functions and stochastic
distances with Support Vector Machines (SVM). We consider several stochastic
distances between Wishart: Bhatacharyya, Kullback-Leibler, Chi-Square,
R\'{e}nyi, and Hellinger. We perform two case studies with PolSAR images, both
simulated and from actual sensors, and different classification scenarios to
compare the performance of Minimum Distance and SVM classification frameworks.
With this, we model the situation of imperfect training samples. We show that
SVM with the proposed kernel functions achieves better performance with respect
to Minimum Distance, at the expense of more computational resources and the
need of parameter tuning. Code and data are provided for reproducibility.

background or prior knowledge. In domains like materials discovery, due to the
flaws and biases in raw experimental data, the identification of X-ray
diffraction patterns (XRD) often requires a huge amount of manual work in
finding refined phases that are similar to the ideal theoretical ones.
Automatically refining the raw XRDs utilizing the simulated theoretical data is
thus desirable. We propose imitation refinement, a novel approach to refine
imperfect input patterns, guided by a pre-trained classifier incorporating
prior knowledge from simulated theoretical data, such that the refined patterns
imitate the ideal data. The classifier is trained on the ideal simulated data
to classify patterns and learns an embedding space where each class is
represented by a prototype. The refiner learns to refine the imperfect patterns
with small modifications, such that their embeddings are closer to the
corresponding prototypes. We show that the refiner can be trained in both
supervised and unsupervised fashions. We further illustrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach both qualitatively and quantitatively in a digit
refinement task and an X-ray diffraction pattern refinement task in materials
discovery.

difficult since many cases of AF are usually clinically silent and undiagnosed.
In particular paroxysmal AF is a form of AF that occurs occasionally, and has a
higher probability of being undetected. In this work, we present an attention
based deep learning framework for detection of paroxysmal AF episodes from a
sequence of windows. Time-frequency representation of 30 seconds recording
windows, over a 10 minute data segment, are fed sequentially into a deep
convolutional neural network for image-based feature extraction, which are then
presented to a bidirectional recurrent neural network with an attention layer
for AF detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework
for transient AF detection, we use a database of 24 hour Holter
Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings acquired from 2850 patients at the
University of Virginia heart station. The algorithm achieves an AUC of 0.94 on
the testing set, which exceeds the performance of baseline models. We also
demonstrate the cross-domain generalizablity of the approach by adapting the
learned model parameters from one recording modality (ECG) to another
(photoplethysmogram) with improved AF detection performance. The proposed high
accuracy, low false alarm algorithm for detecting paroxysmal AF has potential
applications in long-term monitoring using wearable sensors.

systems is a central problem in many science and engineering disciplines. Here,
we combine ideas from the theory of operator-valued kernels with
delay-embedding techniques in dynamical systems to develop of a method for
objective identification of spatiotemporal coherent patterns, without prior
knowledge of the state space and/or the dynamical laws of the system generating
the data. A key aspect of this method is that it operates on a space of
vector-valued observables using a kernel measure of similarity that takes into
account both temporal and spatial degrees of freedom (in contrast, classical
kernel techniques such as PCA utilize aggregate measures of similarity between
'snapshots'). As a result, spectral decomposition of data via our approach
yields a significantly more efficient and physically meaningful representation
of complex spatiotemporal signals than conventional methods based on
scalar-valued kernels. We demonstrate this behavior with applications to an
oscillator model and sea surface temperature data from a climate model.

systems depends critically on minimizing sensitivity to arbitrary
application-specific details whenever possible. For example, if a system is
defined and performs well in one particular Euclidean coordinate frame then it
should be expected to perform identically if that coordinate frame is
arbitrarily rotated or scaled. Similarly, the performance of the system should
not be affected if its key parameters are all consistently defined in metric
units or in imperial units. In this paper we show that a recently introduced
generalized matrix inverse permits performance consistency to be rigorously
guaranteed in control systems that require solutions to underdetermined and/or
overdetermined systems of equations.
