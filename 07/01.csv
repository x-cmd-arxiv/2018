nano platelets reinforced aluminum matrix (GNPs/Al) composite in the form of
sheets. Annealed Al sheets were ARB processed up to 6 pass along with coating
of graphene between stacked sheets in first and second pass. Another set was
prepared with same process parameter in the absence of graphene coating.
Properties of these two set of samples were analyzed on the basis of film
theory of ARB process which enables micro-level mixing of material on stacked
layer interface. Hence the problem of graphene agglomeration was overcome
through our process. The Raman spectra at the cross-section was taken which not
only show the strong interaction of GNPs with Al matrix due to increased D and
D' band but also the graphene quality enhancement on the basis of single
symmetric 2D band. Samples were then subjected to universal testing machine
(UTM) and Vickers microhardness tester. Results showed up to ~73% increment in
yield strength and ~27% increment in hardness of GNPs/Al matrix composite.
Fracture surface of tensile specimen was further examined under SEM to
understand the fracture mechanics at higher passes, which elucidate elongation
variation and delamination behavior of stacked sheets. Deep elongated dimples
with the smoothed surface in GNPs/Al composite are the cause of reduced
elongation. But the final composite was having improved strength with
appreciable ductility. The improvement was further justified by increment in
dislocations, calculated using Williamson-Hall plot on X-ray diffraction (XRD)
data. All results signify the effectiveness of the proposed technique for the
development of GNPs/Al composite.

greater than 1 Kbp with high sequence identity that are copied to other regions
of the genome. SDs are among the most important sources of evolution, a common
cause of genomic structural variation, and several are associated with diseases
of genomic origin. Despite their functional importance, SDs present one of the
major hurdles for de novo genome assembly due to the ambiguity they cause in
building and traversing both state-of-the-art overlap-layout-consensus and de
Bruijn graphs. This causes SD regions to be misassembled, collapsed into a
unique representation, or completely missing from assembled reference genomes
for various organisms. In turn, this missing or incorrect information limits
our ability to fully understand the evolution and the architecture of the
genomes. Despite the essential need to accurately characterize SDs in
assemblies, there is only one tool that has been developed for this purpose,
called Whole Genome Assembly Comparison (WGAC). WGAC is comprised of several
steps that employ different tools and custom scripts, which makes it difficult
and time consuming to use. Thus there is still a need for algorithms to
characterize within-assembly SDs quickly, accurately, and in a user friendly
manner.
  Here we introduce a SEgmental Duplication Evaluation Framework (SEDEF) to
rapidly detect SDs through sophisticated filtering strategies based on Jaccard
similarity and local chaining. We show that SEDEF accurately detects SDs while
maintaining substantial speed up over WGAC that translates into practical run
times of minutes instead of weeks. Notably, our algorithm captures up to 25%
pairwise error between segments, where previous studies focused on only 10%,
allowing us to more deeply track the evolutionary history of the genome.

consecutively erupting magnetic structures and correspondingly two distinct
peaks, during impulsive phase, of an M-class flare (M8.5). Simultaneous
multi-viewpoint observations from $\textit{SDO}$, $\textit{GOES}$ and
$\textit{STEREO-A}$ show that this compound eruption originated from two
pre-existing sigmoidal magnetic structures lying along the same polarity
inversion line. Observations of the associated pre-existing filaments further
show that these magnetic structures are lying one on top of the other,
separated by 12 Mm in height, in a so-called ""double-decker"" configuration. The
high-lying magnetic structure became unstable and erupted first, appearing as
an expanding hot channel seen at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths. About 12
minutes later, the low-lying structure also started to erupt and moved at an
even faster speed compared to the high-lying one. As a result, the two erupting
structures interacted and merged with each other, appearing as a single coronal
mass ejection in the outer corona. We find that the double-decker configuration
is likely caused by the persistent shearing motion and flux cancellation along
the source active region's strong-gradient polarity inversion line. The
successive destabilization of these two separate but closely spaced magnetic
structures, possibly in the form of magnetic flux ropes, led to a compound
solar eruption. The study of the compound eruption provides a unique
opportunity to reveal the formation process, initiation, and evolution of
complex eruptive structures in solar active regions.

to a power-law distribution. Scale-free networks may provide an explanation for
the robustness observed in certain physical and biological phenomena, since the
presence of a few highly connected hub nodes and a large number of small-
degree nodes may provide alternate paths between any two nodes on average --
such robustness has been suggested in studies of metabolic networks, gene
interaction networks and protein folding. A theoretical justification for why
biological networks are often found to be scale-free may lie in the well-known
fact that expanding networks in which new nodes are preferentially attached to
highly connected nodes tend to be scale-free. In this paper, we provide the
first efficient algorithm to compute the connectivity density function for the
ensemble of all secondary structures of a user-specified length, and show both
by computational and theoretical arguments that preferential attachment holds
when expanding the network from length n to length n + 1 structures. Since
existent power-law fitting software, such as powerlaw, cannot be used to
determine a power-law fit for our exponentially large RNA connectivity data, we
also implement efficient code to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for
the power-law scaling factor and associated Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value.
Statistical goodness-of-fit tests indicate that one must reject the hypothesis
that RNA connectivity data follows a power-law distribution. Nevertheless, the
power-law fit is visually a good approximation for the tail of connectivity
data, and provides a rationale for investigation of preferential attachment in
the context of macromolecular folding.

different phenotypes, disease mechanisms, and other biological functions. Many
methods have been proposed to infer networks from gene expression data but have
been hampered by problems such as low sample size, inaccurate constraints, and
incomplete characterizations of regulatory dynamics. Since expression
regulation is dynamic, time-course data can be used to infer causality, but
these datasets tend to be short or sparsely sampled. In addition, temporal
methods typically assume that the expression of a gene at a time point depends
on the expression of other genes at only the immediately preceding time point,
while other methods include additional time points without any constraints to
account for their temporal distance. These limitations can contribute to
inaccurate networks with many missing and anomalous links.
  We adapted the time-lagged Ordered Lasso, a regularized regression method
with temporal monotonicity constraints, for \textit{de novo} reconstruction. We
also developed a semi-supervised method that embeds prior network information
into the Ordered Lasso to discover novel regulatory dependencies in existing

there is still a lack of consensus on the theoretical model explaining such
order, since its second nearest neighbor (NN) and long-range third NN magnetic
interactions are highly unclear. By properly taking into account the orbital
moments, achieved through constraining their directions in the first-principles
calculations, we obtain that the relative angle between orbital and spin
moments is fairly small and in the order of several degrees, which thus
validates the Jeff=1/2 state in Na2IrO3. Surprisingly, we find that the
long-range third NN Heisenberg interactions are sizable whereas the second NN
magnetic interactions are negligible. Using maximally localized Wannier
functions, we show that the sizable long-range third NN Heisenberg interaction
results from the extended nature of the Jeff=1/2 state. Based on our study, we

each of which is obtained from the previous point by considering one of the

end-points: This average is that iterative step's second point, which is used
as the first point for the next iterative step. For string-averaging algorithms

point on one of the convex sets or is equal to the previous point, we present
theorems that provide answers to the following question: ""How can the iterative

resilient, so they can be superiorized to generate sequences that also converge
to a point of the intersection but in a manner that is superior with respect to

joint caching and multicasting for multi-quality videos encoded using two video
encoding techniques, namely scalable video coding (SVC), and HEVC or H.264 as
in dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) respectively, in a large-scale

of an SVC-based video or descriptions of a DASH-based video. Then, for each
type of videos, we derive tractable expressions for the successful transmission
probability in the general and high user density regions, respectively,
utilizing tools from stochastic geometry. The analytical results reveal that in
the high user density region, the marginal increase of the successful
transmission probability with respect to the caching probability of a video
with a certain quality reduces when the caching probability increases. Next,
for each type of videos, we consider the maximization of the successful
transmission probability in the high user density region, which is a convex

a two-stage optimization method to obtain a low-complexity near optimal

ferroelectric material, in which the electric polarization is induced by a
combination of the coherent TiO$_6$ octahedral rotation and tilting. In this
work, we investigate the tuning of ferroelectricity of Ca$_3$Ti$_2$O$_7$ using
iso-valent substitutions on Ca-sites. Due to the size mismatch, larger/smaller
alkaline earths prefer $A$'/$A$ sites respectively, allowing the possibility
for site-selective substitutions. Without extra carriers, such site-selected
iso-valent substitutions can significantly tune the TiO$_6$ octahedral rotation
and tilting, and thus change the structure and polarization. Using the
first-principles calculations, our study reveals that three substituted cases
(Sr, Mg, Sr+Mg) show divergent physical behaviors. In particular,
(CaTiO$_3$)$_2$SrO becomes non-polar, which can reasonably explain the
suppression of polarization upon Sr substitution observed in experiment. In
contrast, the polarization in (MgTiO$_3$)$_2$CaO is almost doubled upon
substitutions, while the estimated coercivity for ferroelectric switching does
not change. The (MgTiO$_3$)$_2$SrO remains polar but its structural space group
changes, with moderate increased polarization and possible different
ferroelectric switching paths. Our study reveals the subtle ferroelectricity in
the $A_3$Ti$_2$O$_7$ family and suggests one more practical route to tune
hybrid improper ferroelectricity, in addition to the strain effect.

the block maxima (BM) method and the peak-over-threshold (POT) approach. It
seems to be general consensus among researchers in the field that the POT
method makes use of extreme observations more efficiently than the BM method.
We shed light on this discussion from three different perspectives. First,
based on recent theoretical results for the BM approach, we provide a
theoretical comparison in i.i.d.\ scenarios. We argue that the data generating
process may favour either one or the other approach. Second, if the underlying
data possesses serial dependence, we argue that the choice of a method should
be primarily guided by the ultimate statistical interest: for instance, POT is
preferable for quantile estimation, while BM is preferable for return level
estimation. Finally, we discuss the two approaches for multivariate
observations and identify various open ends for future research.

A new dynamic slackness variable method is presented. As a result, an indirect

to covers is as for the Weyl law in the case of surfaces of finite area. For
the latter counting function we deduce a bound in terms of the covering degree
and the minimal length of a periodic geodesic on the covering surface. This
yields an improved fractal Weyl upper bound. In the setting of Schottky

This black hole solution was recently developed in the context of the coupled

found to depend on the mass $M$ and the charge $q$ of the black hole, the

analyzed, illustrating the rather extraordinary character of the spacetime

  Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inference for state-of-the-art deep neural networks is computationally
expensive, making them difficult to deploy on constrained hardware
environments. An efficient way to reduce this complexity is to quantize the
weight parameters and/or activations during training by approximating their
distributions with a limited entry codebook. For very low-precisions, such as
binary or ternary networks with 1-8-bit activations, the information loss from
quantization leads to significant accuracy degradation due to large gradient
mismatches between the forward and backward functions. In this paper, we
introduce a quantization method to reduce this loss by learning a symmetric
codebook for particular weight subgroups. These subgroups are determined based
on their locality in the weight matrix, such that the hardware simplicity of
the low-precision representations is preserved. Empirically, we show that
symmetric quantization can substantially improve accuracy for networks with
extremely low-precision weights and activations. We also demonstrate that this
representation imposes minimal or no hardware implications to more
coarse-grained approaches. Source code is available at

and the prices: the larger $r$ and $s$ the closer the fit. For $r , s \leq 1$
this notion provides a graceful degradation for the conditional equilibria of

strongly thermally stratified fluid within a spherical shell subject to a
prescribed laterally inhomogeneous heat-flux condition at the outer boundary.
Using a numerical model, we explore a broad range of three key dimensionless
numbers: a thermal stratification parameter (the relative size of boundary
temperature gradients to imposed vertical temperature gradients), $10^{-3} \le
S \le 10^{4}$, a buoyancy parameter (the strength of applied boundary heat flux
anomalies), $ 10^{-3} \le B \le 10^{6}$, and the Ekman number (ratio of viscous
to Coriolis forces), $10^{-6} \le E \le 10^{-4}$. We find both steady and
time-dependent solutions and delineate the temporal regime boundaries. We focus
on steady-state solutions, for which a clear transition is found between a low
$S$ regime, in which buoyancy dominates dynamics, and a high $S$ regime, in
which stratification dominates. For the latter case, the radial and horizontal
velocities scale respectively as $u_r \sim S^{-1}$, $u_h \sim S^{-\frac{3}{4}}\
B^{\frac{1}{4}}$ and are confined to boundary-induced flow within a thin layer
of depth $(S\ B)^{-\frac{1}{4}}$ at the outer edge of the domain. For the
Earth, if lower-mantle heterogeneous structure is due principally to chemical
anomalies, we estimate that the core is in the high-$S$ regime and steady flows
arising from strong outer-boundary thermal anomalies cannot penetrate the
stable layer. However, if the mantle heterogeneities are due to thermal
anomalies and the heat-flux variation is large, the core will be in a low-$S$

DNN-based models and propose Product-based Neural Network (PNN) which adopts a

product to a net-in-net architecture, we further propose Product-network In

surface, will change if the waves encounter perturbations e.g. in the sound
speed or flows, as they propagate through the solar interior. Using functions
called sensitivity kernels, we may image the underlying anomalies that cause
measured shifts in travel times. The inference of large-scale structures e.g
meridional circulation requires computing sensitivity kernels in spherical
geometry. Mandal et al. (2017) have computed such spherical kernels in the
limit of the first-Born approximation. In this work, we perform an inversion
for meridional circulation using travel-time measurements obtained from 6 years
of SDO/HMI data and those sensitivity kernels. We enforce mass conservation by
inverting for a stream function. The number of free parameters is reduced by
projecting the solution on to cubic B-splines in radius and derivatives of the
Legendre-polynomial basis in latitude, thereby improving the condition number
of the inverse problem. We validate our approach for synthetic observations
before performing the actual inversion. The inversion suggests a single-cell
profile with the return-flow occurring at depths below 0.78 $R_\odot$.

distributed small-size traffic flows passing through the SDN-enabled switches
(possibly Fog Nodes). The main aim of this integration is to support service
delivery in real-time, failure recovery, and fault-awareness in an SFC context.
Firstly, we present an architecture for Failure Recovery and Fault Prevention
called FRFP; this is a multi-tier structure in which the real-time traffic
flows pass through SDN-enabled switches to jointly decrease the network
side-effects of flow rerouting and energy consumption of the Fog Nodes. We then
mathematically formulate an optimization problem called the Optimal
Fog-Supported Energy-Aware SFC rerouting algorithm (OFES) and propose a
near-optimal heuristic called Heuristic OFES (HFES) to solve the corresponding
problem in polynomial time. In this way, the energy consumption and the
reliability of the selected paths are optimized, while the Quality of Service
constraints are met and the network congestion is minimized. In a reliability
context, the focus of this work is on fault prevention; however, since we use a
reallocation technique, the proposed scheme can be used as a failure recovery
scheme. We compare the performance of HFES and OFES in terms of power
consumption, average path length, fault probability, network side-effects, link
utilization, and Fog Node utilization. Additionally, we analyze the
computational complexity of HFES. We use a real-world network topology to
evaluate our algorithm. The simulation results show that the heuristic

$$\Delta u+V(x)u=0$$ in an exterior domain decays faster than $e^{-\kappa|x|}$,
for some $\kappa>\sqrt{\sup |V|}$, then it must be identically equal to $0$.
This property can be viewed as a unique continuation at infinity (UCI) for
solutions satisfying a suitable exponential decay. The Landis conjecture was
disproved by Meshkov in the case of complex-valued functions, but it remained
open in the real case. In the 2000s, several papers have addressed the issue of
the UCI for linear elliptic operators with real coefficients. The results that
have been obtained require some kind of sign condition, either on the solution
or on the zero order coefficient of the equation. The Landis conjecture is
still open nowadays in its general form. In the present paper, we start with
considering a general (real) elliptic operator in dimension $1$. We derive the
UCI property with a rate of decay $\kappa$ which is sharp when the coefficients
of the operator are constant. In particular, we prove the Landis conjecture in
dimension $1$, and we can actually reach the threshold value $\kappa=\sqrt{\sup
|V|}$. Next, we derive the UCI property -- and then the Landis conjecture --
for radial operators in arbitrary dimension. Finally, with a different
approach, we prove the same result for positive supersolutions of general
elliptic equations.

have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracies involving large-scale
classification and recognition tasks. Indeed, a major landmark that enables
efficient hardware accelerators for deep networks is the recent advances from
the machine learning community that have demonstrated aggressively scaled deep
binary networks with state-of-the-art accuracies. In this paper, we demonstrate
how deep binary networks can be accelerated in modified von-Neumann machines by
enabling binary convolutions within the SRAM array. In general, binary
convolutions consist of bit-wise XNOR followed by a population-count
(popcount). We present a charge sharing XNOR and popcount operation in 10
transistor SRAM cells. We have employed multiple circuit techniques including
dual-read-worldines (Dual-RWL) along with a dual-stage ADC that overcomes the
inaccuracies of a low precision ADC, to achieve a fairly accurate popcount. In
addition, a key highlight of the present work is the fact that we propose
sectioning of the SRAM array by adding switches onto the read-bitlines, thereby
achieving improved parallelism. This is beneficial for deep networks, where the
kernel size grows and requires to be stored in multiple sub-banks. As such, one
needs to evaluate the partial popcount from multiple sub-banks and sum them up
for achieving the final popcount. For n-sections per sub-array, we can perform
n convolutions within one particular sub-bank, thereby improving overall system
throughput as well as the energy efficiency. Our results at the array level
show that the energy consumption and delay per-operation was 1.914pJ and 45ns,
respectively. Moreover, an energy improvement of 2.5x, and a performance
improvement of 4x was achieved by using the proposed sectioned-SRAM, compared
to a non-sectioned SRAM design.

distribution. This question has gained increasing attention, particularly in

risk at high quantiles. Recent methods answer this question by multiple uses of
the standard goodness-of-fit tests. These tests are based on a particular
choice of symmetric weighting of the mean square error between the empirical

rates high quantiles more than small ones, we propose new goodness-of-fit tests

family of asymmetric weight functions and calculate the corresponding mean

variance distortionless (MVDR) beamforming using the sample covariance matrix
(SCM). In a snapshot limited environment, the SCM is poorly conditioned
resulting in a suboptimal performance from the SMI beamformer. Imposing
structural constraints on the SCM estimate to satisfy known theoretical
properties of the ensemble MVDR beamformer mitigates the impact of limited
snapshots on the SMI beamformer performance. Toeplitz rectification and
bounding the norm of weight vector are common approaches for such constrains.
This paper proposes the unit circle rectification technique which constraints
the SMI beamformer to satisfy a property of the ensemble MVDR beamformer: for
narrowband planewave beamforming on a uniform linear array, the zeros of the
MVDR weight array polynomial must fall on the unit circle. Numerical
simulations show that the resulting unit circle MVDR (UC MVDR) beamformer
frequently improves the suppression of both discrete interferers and white

matrix. Furthermore, we have implemented a software which makes it possible to
compare different methods of reconstructing data compression. To make this
comparison, it is necessary to draw and compare certain graphs, e.g. phase
transition, the ratio of output signal to noise and input signal to noise,
signal to noise output and also the ratio of percentage of accurate
reconstructing and order of sparse signals for various reconstructing methods.
To facilitate this process, the user would be able to draw his/her favorite
graphs in GUI environment.

  Non-Gaussian Correlated Process Variations",,,,,"cs.NA cs.CE math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the invention of generalized polynomial chaos in 2002, uncertainty
quantification has impacted many engineering fields, including variation-aware
design automation of integrated circuits and integrated photonics. Due to the
fast convergence rate, the generalized polynomial chaos expansion has achieved
orders-of-magnitude speedup than Monte Carlo in many applications. However,
almost all existing generalized polynomial chaos methods have a strong
assumption: the uncertain parameters are mutually independent or Gaussian
correlated. This assumption rarely holds in many realistic applications, and it
has been a long-standing challenge for both theorists and practitioners.
  This paper propose a rigorous and efficient solution to address the challenge
of non-Gaussian correlation. We first extend generalized polynomial chaos, and
propose a class of smooth basis functions to efficiently handle non-Gaussian
correlations. Then, we consider high-dimensional parameters, and develop a
scalable tensor method to compute the proposed basis functions. Finally, we
develop a sparse solver with adaptive sample selections to solve
high-dimensional uncertainty quantification problems. We validate our theory
and algorithm by electronic and photonic ICs with 19 to 57 non-Gaussian
correlated variation parameters. The results show that our approach outperforms
Monte Carlo by $2500\times$ to $3000\times$ in terms of efficiency. Moreover,
our method can accurately predict the output density functions with multiple
peaks caused by non-Gaussian correlations, which is hard to handle by existing
methods.
  Based on the results in this paper, many novel uncertainty quantification
algorithms can be developed and can be further applied to a broad range of
engineering domains.

Phys. 1:77 (2018)",,,"hep-th cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most profound aspects of the standard model of particle physics,
the mechanism of confinement binding quarks into hadrons, is not sufficiently
understood. The only known semiclassical mechanism of confinement, mediated by
chromo-electric strings in a condensate of magnetic monopoles still lacks
experimental evidence. Here we show that the infinite resistance
superinsulating state, which emerges on the insulating side of the
superconductor-insulator transition in superconducting films offers a
realization of confinement that allows for a direct experimental access. We
find that superinsulators realize a single-color version of quantum
chromodynamics and establish the mapping of quarks onto Cooper pairs. We reveal
that the mechanism of superinsulation is the linear binding of Cooper pairs
into neutral ""mesons"" by electric strings. Our findings offer a powerful
laboratory for exploring and testing the fundamental implications of
confinement, asymptotic freedom, and related quantum chromodynamics phenomena
via desktop experiments on superconductors.

security services for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) which are used for the
Internet and wired networks. In MANETs (wireless and ad hoc) there is an
inability to offer a centralized CA to provide these security services. Recent
research has looked to facilitate the use of CAs within MANETs through the use
of a Distributed Certificate Authority (DCA) for wireless and ad hoc networks.
This paper presents a number of different types of DCA protocols and
categorizes them into groups based on their factors and specifications. The
paper concludes by proposing the best DCA security services in terms of
performance and level of security.
