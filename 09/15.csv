is understood in the sense of Borel. We give the two usual definitions of
equivariant motives, via the simplicial Borel construction and via algebraic
approximations of it. The definitions turn out to be equivalent and give rise
to a full six-functor formalism. For rational \'etale motives over a finite
field or the homotopical stable algebraic derivator arising from the
semisimplified Hodge realization, the equivariant mixed Tate motives provide a
graded version of the equivariant derived category. We show that, in
sufficiently nice and clean cases, these categories admit weight structures;
moreover, a tilting result holds which identifies the category of equivariant
mixed Tate motives with the bounded homotopy category of the heart of its
weight structure. This can be seen as a formality result for equivariant
derived categories. We also discuss convolution functors on equivariant mixed
Tate motives, and consequences for the categorification of the Hecke algebra

breaking: this is the mode triggered by smeared anti-D3 branes at the tip of
the warped throat. Our results strengthen the evidence that {\it if} the KKLT

(priors) that can improve orbital solutions for low-phase-coverage orbits,
where data cover less than approximately 40% of an orbit. In instances of low
phase coverage such as with stellar orbits in the Galactic center or with
directly-imaged exoplanets, data have low constraining power and thus priors
can bias parameter estimates and produce under-estimated confidence intervals.
Uniform priors, which are commonly assumed in orbit fitting, are notorious for
this. We propose a new observable-based prior paradigm that is based on
uniformity in observables. We compare performance of this observable-based
prior and of commonly assumed uniform priors using Galactic center and
directly-imaged exoplanet (HR 8799) data. The observable-based prior can reduce
biases in model parameters by a factor of two and helps avoid under-estimation
of confidence intervals for simulations with less than about 40% phase
coverage. Above this threshold, orbital solutions for objects with sufficient
phase coverage such as S0-2, a short-period star at the Galactic center with
full phase coverage, are consistent with previously published results. Below
this threshold, the observable-based prior limits prior influence in regions of
prior dominance and increases data influence. Using the observable-based prior,
HR 8799 orbital analyses favor lower eccentricity orbits and provide stronger
evidence that the four planets have a consistent inclination around 30 degrees
to within 1-sigma. This analysis also allows for the possibility of
coplanarity. We present metrics to quantify improvements in orbital estimates
with different priors so that observable-based prior frameworks can be tested
and implemented for other low-phase-coverage orbits.

to analyzing high-dimensional data. An attractive property of the lasso is that
it naturally performs variable selection. An important area of concern,
however, is the reliability of these variable selections. Motivated by local
false discovery rate methodology from the large-scale hypothesis testing
literature, we propose a method for calculating a local false discovery rate
for each variable under consideration by the lasso model. These rates can be
used to assess the reliability of an individual feature, or to estimate the
model's overall false discovery rate. The method can be used for all values of
$\lambda$. This is particularly useful for models with a few highly significant
features but a high overall Fdr, which are a relatively common occurrence when
using cross validation to select $\lambda$. It is also flexible enough to be
applied to many varieties of penalized likelihoods including GLM and Cox
models, and a variety of penalties, including MCP and SCAD. We demonstrate the
validity of this approach and contrast it with other inferential methods for
penalized regression as well as with local false discovery rates for univariate
hypothesis tests. Finally, we show the practical utility of our method by
applying it to two case studies involving high dimensional genetic data.

CAVE-AR is based on the concept of representing in the same global reference
system both in AR content and tracking information, mixing geographical
information, architectural features, and sensor data to simulate the context of
an AR experience. Thanks to its novel abstraction of existing tracking
technologies, CAVE-AR operates independently of users' devices, and integrates
with existing programming tools to provide maximum flexibility. Our VR
application provides designers with ways to create and modify an AR
application, even while others are in the midst of using it. CAVE-AR further
allows the designer to track how users are behaving, preview what they are
currently seeing, and interact with them through several different channels. To
illustrate our proposed development workflow and demonstrate the advantages of
our authoring system, we introduce two CAVEAR use cases in which an augmented
reality application is created and tested. We compare the CAVE-AR workflow to
traditional development methods and demonstrate the importance of simulation
and live application debugging.

  Combinatorial Optimization","Full version of paper accepted at AAAI 2019",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Creating impact in real-world settings requires artificial intelligence
techniques to span the full pipeline from data, to predictive models, to
decisions. These components are typically approached separately: a machine
learning model is first trained via a measure of predictive accuracy, and then
its predictions are used as input into an optimization algorithm which produces
a decision. However, the loss function used to train the model may easily be
misaligned with the end goal, which is to make the best decisions possible.
Hand-tuning the loss function to align with optimization is a difficult and
error-prone process (which is often skipped entirely).
  We focus on combinatorial optimization problems and introduce a general
framework for decision-focused learning, where the machine learning model is
directly trained in conjunction with the optimization algorithm to produce
high-quality decisions. Technically, our contribution is a means of integrating
common classes of discrete optimization problems into deep learning or other
predictive models, which are typically trained via gradient descent. The main
idea is to use a continuous relaxation of the discrete problem to propagate
gradients through the optimization procedure. We instantiate this framework for
two broad classes of combinatorial problems: linear programs and submodular
maximization. Experimental results across a variety of domains show that
decision-focused learning often leads to improved optimization performance
compared to traditional methods. We find that standard measures of accuracy are
not a reliable proxy for a predictive model's utility in optimization, and our
method's ability to specify the true goal as the model's training objective
yields substantial dividends across a range of decision problems.

lower ionization state species whose columns vary by orders of magnitude along
\st{difference} \textbf{different} sightlines, indicates that the CGM must be
viewed as a dynamic, multiphase medium, such as occurs in the presence of
turbulence. To explore this possibility, we carry out a series of
chemodynamical simulations of a isotropic turbulent media, using the MAIHEM
package. The simulations assume a metallicity of $0.3\ Z_{\odot}$ and a
redshift zero metagalatic UV background, and they track ionizations,
recombinations, and species-by-species radiative cooling for a wide range of
elements. We find that turbulence with a one-dimensional velocity dispersion of
$\sigma_{1D} \approx 60$ km/s replicates many of the observed features within
the CGM, such as clumping of low ionization-state ions and the existence of
\ion{O}{6} at moderate ionization parameters. However, unlike observations,
\ion{N}{5} often arises in our simulations with derived column densities of a
similar magnitude to those of \ion{O}{6}. While higher values of $\sigma_{1D}$
lead to a thermal runaway in our isotropic simulations, this would not be the
case in stratified media, and thus we speculate that more complex models of the
turbulence may well match the absence of \ion{N}{5} in the CGM of star-forming
galaxies.

dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. The cancer enhances on dynamic
contrast-enhanced MR imaging because the contrast agent leaks from the leaky
vessels into the interstitial space. The contrast agent subsequently leaks back
into the vascular space, creating a washout effect. The normal parenchymal
tissue of the breast can also enhance after contrast injection. This
enhancement generally increases over time. Typically, a radiologist assesses
this background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) using the Breast Imaging
Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). According to the BI-RADS, BPE refers to
the volume of enhancement and the intensity of enhancement and is divided in
four incremental categories: minimal, mild, moderate, and marked.
  Researchers have developed semi-automatic and automatic methods to extract
properties of BPE from MR images. For clarity, in this syllabus the BI-RADS

Fulfillment of the bold reliability figures becomes meaningful only if it can

this model is generally not known and needs to be learned by sampling the
wireless environment. In this paper we treat this fundamental problem in the
simplest possible communication-theoretic setting: selecting a transmission
rate over a dynamic wireless channel in order to guarantee high transmission
reliability. We introduce a novel statistical framework for design and
assessment of URLLC systems, consisting of three key components: (i) channel
model selection; (ii) learning the model using training; (3) selecting the
transmission rate to satisfy the required reliability. As it is insufficient to
specify the URLLC requirements only through PER, two types of statistical
constraints are introduced, Averaged Reliability (AR) and Probably Correct
Reliability (PCR). The analysis and the evaluations show that adequate model

Jupiters could have formed via rapid gas accretion in their current orbital
neighborhood. In this study, we examine the period-mass distribution of
close-in giant planets, and demonstrate that the inner boundary of this
population conforms to the expectations of the in-situ formation scenario.
Specifically, we show that if conglomeration unfolds close to the disk's inner
edge, the semi-major axis - mass relation of the emergent planets should follow
a power law $a \propto M^{-2/7}$ - a trend clearly reflected in the data. We
further discuss corrections to this relationship due to tidal decay of
planetary orbits. Although our findings do not discount orbital migration as an
active physical process, they suggest that the characteristic range of orbital

morphology of simulated neutral hydrogen (HI) density fields using Shapefinders
at various stages of reionization from the excursion set approach. Accompanying
the Shapefinders, we also employ the 'largest cluster statistic' (LCS) to
understand the percolation process. Percolation curves demonstrate that the
non-Gaussianity in the HI field increases as reionization progresses. The large
clusters in both the HI overdense and underdense excursion sets possess similar
values of ""thickness"" ($T$), as well as ""breadth"" ($B$), but their third
Shapefinder - ""length"" ($L$) - becomes almost proportional to their volume. The
large clusters in both HI overdense and underdense segments are overwhelmingly
filamentary. The 'cross-section' of a filamentary cluster can be estimated
using the product of the first two Shapefinders, $T \times B$. Hence the cross
sections of the large clusters at the onset of percolation do not vary much
with volume and their sizes only differ in terms of their lengths. This feature
appears more vividly in HI overdense regions than in underdense regions and is

elections via misinformation, such as fake news. We study a zero-sum game
between an attacker, who attempts to subvert an election by propagating a fake
new story or other misinformation over a set of advertising channels, and a
defender who attempts to limit the attacker's impact. Computing an equilibrium
in this game is challenging as even the pure strategy sets of players are
exponential. Nevertheless, we give provable polynomial-time approximation
algorithms for computing the defender's minimax optimal strategy across a range
of settings, encompassing different population structures as well as models of
the information available to each player. Experimental results confirm that our
algorithms provide near-optimal defender strategies and showcase variations in
the difficulty of defending elections depending on the resources and knowledge
available to the defender.

large-scale, simultaneous recordings from distributed neuronal structures at a
cellular-level resolution. One major hurdle to design high-bandwidth,
high-precision, large-scale neural interfaces lies in the formidable data
streams that are generated by the recorder chip and need to be online
transferred to a remote computer. The data rates can require hundreds to
thousands of I/O pads on the recorder chip and power consumption on the order
of Watts for data streaming alone. We developed a deep learning-based
compression model to reduce the data rate of multichannel action potentials.
The proposed model is built upon a deep compressive autoencoder (CAE) with
discrete latent embeddings. The encoder is equipped with residual
transformations to extract representative features from spikes, which are
mapped into the latent embedding space and updated via vector quantization
(VQ). The decoder network reconstructs spike waveforms from the quantized
latent embeddings. Experimental results show that the proposed model
consistently outperforms conventional methods by achieving much higher
compression ratios (20-500x) and better or comparable reconstruction
accuracies. Testing results also indicate that CAE is robust against a diverse
range of imperfections, such as waveform variation and spike misalignment, and
has minor influence on spike sorting accuracy. Furthermore, we have estimated
the hardware cost and real-time performance of CAE and shown that it could
support thousands of recording channels simultaneously without excessive
power/heat dissipation. The proposed model can reduce the required data
transmission bandwidth in large-scale recording experiments and maintain good
signal qualities. The code of this work has been made available at

  Prediction","PhD Thesis",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this dissertation, we focus on several important problems in structured
prediction. In structured prediction, the label has a rich intrinsic
substructure, and the loss varies with respect to the predicted label and the
true label pair. Structured SVM is an extension of binary SVM to adapt to such
structured tasks.
  In the first part of the dissertation, we study the surrogate losses and its
efficient methods. To minimize the empirical risk, a surrogate loss which upper
bounds the loss, is used as a proxy to minimize the actual loss. Since the
objective function is written in terms of the surrogate loss, the choice of the
surrogate loss is important, and the performance depends on it. Another issue
regarding the surrogate loss is the efficiency of the argmax label inference
for the surrogate loss. Efficient inference is necessary for the optimization
since it is often the most time-consuming step. We present a new class of
surrogate losses named bi-criteria surrogate loss, which is a generalization of
the popular surrogate losses. We first investigate an efficient method for a
slack rescaling formulation as a starting point utilizing decomposability of
the model. Then, we extend the algorithm to the bi-criteria surrogate loss,
which is very efficient and also shows performance improvements.
  In the second part of the dissertation, another important issue of
regularization is studied. Specifically, we investigate a problem of
regularization in hierarchical classification when a structural imbalance
exists in the label structure. We present a method to normalize the structure,
as well as a new norm, namely shared Frobenius norm. It is suitable for
hierarchical classification that adapts to the data in addition to the label
structure.

prevalent assumption in simulating rigid bodies undergoing intermittent contact

mixed complementarity problem where we solve the contact detection and
integration of the equations of motion simultaneously. Thus, our method is a
geometrically-implicit method and we prove that in our formulation, there is no
artificial penetration between the contacting rigid bodies. We solve for the
equivalent contact point (ECP) and contact impulse of each contact patch
simultaneously along with the state, i.e., configuration and velocity of the

patches between two objects is less than or equal to three, the state evolution
of the bodies is unique, although the contact impulses and ECP may not be
unique. We also present simulation results showing that our method can

$\hat{\mathbf{y}}$-direction deviates from the quantized value $j_y \, h/F = n$
due to the finite value of $F$ and the details of the switching-on protocol.
Exploiting the time-periodicity of the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}(t)$, we use Floquet
techniques to study this problem. In this picture the (Kubo) linear response
$F\to 0$ regime corresponds to the adiabatic limit for $\hat{H}(t)$. In the
case of a sudden quench $j_y \, h/F$ shows $F^2$ corrections to the perfectly
quantized limit. When the switching-on is smooth, the result depends on the
switch-on time $t_{0}$: for a fixed $t_{0}$ we observe a crossover force $F^*$
between a quadratic regime for $F<F^*$ and a {\em non-analytic} exponential
$\mathrm{e}^{-\gamma/|F|}$ for $F>F^*$. The crossover $F^*$ decreases as
$t_{0}$ increases, eventually recovering the topological robustness. These
effects are in principle amenable to experimental tests in optical lattice cold
atomic systems with synthetic gauge fields.

have shown that a hyperuniform state is achievable when the system goes through
an absorbing phase transition to a critical state. Here we investigate to what
extent hyperuniformity is preserved when the model is generalized to particles
with a size distribution and/or nonspherical shapes. We begin by examining
binary disks in two dimensions and demonstrate that their critical states are
hyperuniform as two-phase media, but not hyperuniform nor multihyperuniform as
point patterns formed by the particle centroids. We further confirm the
generality of our findings by studying particles with a continuous size
distribution. Finally, to study the effect of rotational degrees of freedom, we
extend our model to noncircular particles, namely, hard rectangles with various
aspect ratios, including the hard-needle limit. Although these systems exhibit
only short-range orientational order, hyperuniformity is still preserved. Our
analysis reveals that the redistribution of the ""mass"" of the particles rather
than the particle centroids is central to this dynamical process. The
consideration of the ""active volume fraction"" of generalized random
organization models may help to resolve which universality class they belong to
and hence may lead to a deeper theoretical understanding of absorbing-state
models. Our results suggest that general particle systems subject to random
organization can be a robust way to fabricate a wide class of hyperuniform
states of matter by tuning the structures via different particle-size and
-shape distributions. This in turn potentially enables the creation of
multifunctional hyperuniform materials with desirable optical, transport, and
mechanical properties.

twin stars, can be used to put in context the solar cycle. However, there is a
relatively low percentage of these stars with activity cycles detected. It is
well known that the cores of Ca II H&K lines are modulated by stellar activity.
The behaviour of Balmer and other optical lines with stellar activity is not
yet completely understood.
  Aims. To search for Ca II H&K, Balmer and Fe II line variations modulated by
the stellar activity. In particular, we apply a novel strategy to detect
possible shape variations in the H{\alpha} line.
  Methods. We analyse activity signatures in HD 38858 by using HARPS and CASLEO
spectra obtained between 2003 and 2017. We calculate the Mount Wilson index
(S$_{MW}$), log($\mathrm{R}'_\mathrm{HK}$) and the statistical moments of Ca II
H&K, Balmer and other optical lines. We search for periodicities by using the
generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram.
  Results. We detect a long-term activity cycle of 10.8 yr in Ca II H&K and
H{\alpha}, being HD 38858 one of the most similar stars to the Sun for which a
cycle has been detected. In contrast, this cycle is marginally detected in the
Fe II lines. Also, we detect a noticeable radial velocity variation, which
seems to be produced by stellar activity.
  Conclusions. HD 38858 is the second solar-analogue star where we find a clear
activity cycle which is replicated by Balmer lines. Spectral indexes based on
the shape of H{\alpha} seems to be more realiable than the fluxes in the same
line to detect activity variations. On the other hand, the cyclic modulation
detected gives place to a radial velocity variation, previously associated to a
super-Earth planet. Finally, due to the similarity of HD 38858 with the Sun, we
recommend to continue monitoring this star.

distorted images. It is fundamental in computer vision, experimental physics,
and medical imaging. Many algorithms and analyses exist for inferring shift,
rotation, and nonlinear transformations between image coordinates. Even in the
simplest case of translation, however, all known algorithms are biased and none
have achieved the precision limit of the Cramer Rao bound (CRB). Following
Bayesian inference, we prove that the standard method of shifting one image to
match another cannot reach the CRB. We show that the bias can be cured and the
CRB reached if, instead, we use Super Registration: learning an optimal model
for the underlying image and shifting that to match the data. Our theory shows
that coarse-graining oversampled images can improve registration precision of
the standard method. For oversampled data, our method does not yield striking
improvements as measured by eye. In these cases, however, we show our new
registration method can lead to dramatic improvements in extractable
information, for example, inferring $10\times$ more precise particle positions.

correlations in fission. To make the best possible simulations, FREYA one must
find the optimized values of the five physics-based parameters which
characterize the events produced by FREYA. So far this has been done only
empirically or by brute force computational techniques. Purpose: We seek to
develop a method of parameter optimization for FREYA that would include
uncertainty quantification and an analysis of the correlations between the
parameters. Methods: We focus on spontaneous fission as a simpler test case of
the method. We first check the results of previous optimizations for
$^{252}$Cf(sf) and then go on to develop a simulated annealing approach to
optimize the parameters. Although $^{252}$Cf(sf) has the most measured
observables, we are able to apply the technique to all spontaneously fissioning
isotopes in the current version of FREYA. Results: We find optimal values of
the five FREYA parameters, with uncertainties, for all isotopes studied. Our
results are compared with available data. The parameter values are physically
reasonable and in accord with intuition, even in cases where the data for
optimization are sparse to non-existent. Conclusions: The simulated annealing
method provides a way to determine the best parameters for the
phenomenologically-successful fission model FREYA. We have developed an
algorithm that can be updated to include additional isotopes or more data sets
for the current isotopes as they become available.

BHs in good agreement with observations, but we note an excess of faint AGN in
hard X-ray (L_x ~ 10^{43-44} erg/s), and a lower number of bright AGN
(L_x>10^{44} erg/s), a conclusion that varies quantitatively but not
qualitatively with BH luminosity estimation method. The lower Eddington ratios
of the 10^{9} Msun BHs compared to observations suggest that AGN feedback may
be too efficient in this regime. We study galaxy star formation activity and
structural properties, and design sample-dependent criteria to identify
different galaxy types (star-forming/quiescent, extended/compact) that we apply
both to the simulations and observations from the candels fields. We analyze
how the simulated and observed galaxies populate the specific star formation
rate - stellar mass surface density diagram. A large fraction of the z=0
M_{star}>10^{11} Msun quiescent galaxies first experienced a compaction phase
(i.e. reduction of galaxy size) while still forming stars, and then a quenching
event. We measure the dependence of AGN fraction on galaxies' locations in this
diagram. After correcting the simulations with a redshift and AGN
luminosity-dependent model for AGN obscuration, we find good qualitative and
quantitative agreement with observations. The AGN fraction is the highest among
compact star-forming galaxies (16-20% at z~1.5-2), and the lowest among compact
quiescent galaxies (6-10% at z~1.5-2).

  Science",,,,,"stat.ME cs.LG math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adaptive data analysis has posed a challenge to science due to its ability to
generate false hypotheses on moderately large data sets. In general, with
non-adaptive data analyses (where queries to the data are generated without
being influenced by answers to previous queries) a data set containing $n$
samples may support exponentially many queries in $n$. This number reduces to
linearly many under naive adaptive data analysis, and even sophisticated
remedies such as the Reusable Holdout (Dwork et. al 2015) only allow
quadratically many queries in $n$.
  In this work, we propose a new framework for adaptive science which
exponentially improves on this number of queries under a restricted yet
scientifically relevant setting, where the goal of the scientist is to find a
single (or a few) true hypotheses about the universe based on the samples. Such
a setting may describe the search for predictive factors of some disease based
on medical data, where the analyst may wish to try a number of predictive
models until a satisfactory one is found.
  Our solution, the Generic Holdout, involves two simple ingredients: (1) a
partitioning of the data into a exploration set and a holdout set and (2) a
limited exposure strategy for the holdout set. An analyst is free to use the
exploration set arbitrarily, but when testing hypotheses against the holdout
set, the analyst only learns the answer to the question: ""Is the given
hypothesis true (empirically) on the holdout set?"" -- and no more information,
such as ""how well"" the hypothesis fits the holdout set. The resulting scheme is
immediate to analyze, but despite its simplicity we do not believe our method
is obvious, as evidenced by the many violations in practice.
  Our proposal can be seen as an alternative to pre-registration, and allows
researchers to get the benefits of adaptive data analysis without the problems
of adaptivity.

  of DCNN","11",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An iterative method of learning has become a paradigm for training deep
convolutional neural networks (DCNN). However, utilizing a non-iterative
learning strategy can accelerate the training process of the DCNN and
surprisingly such approach has been rarely explored by the deep learning (DL)
community. It motivates this paper to introduce a non-iterative learning
strategy that eliminates the backpropagation (BP) at the top dense or fully
connected (FC) layers of DCNN, resulting in, lower training time and higher
performance. The proposed method exploits the Moore-Penrose Inverse to pull
back the current residual error to each FC layer, generating well-generalized
features. Then using the recomputed features, i.e., the new generalized
features the weights of each FC layer is computed according to the
Moore-Penrose Inverse. We evaluate the proposed approach on six widely accepted
object recognition benchmark datasets: Scene-15, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SUN-397,
Places365, and ImageNet. The experimental results show that the proposed method
obtains significant improvements over 30 state-of-the-art methods.
Interestingly, it also indicates that any DCNN with the proposed method can
provide better performance than the same network with its original training
based on BP.

nuclear, leptonic, and photonic equations of state, and a nuclear reaction
network, along with other refinements, can be used to study the role of
neutrino radiation, hydrodynamic instabilities, and a variety of input physics

on the implementation of an auto-encoder based Boundary Equilibrium GAN (BEGAN)

has opened up possibilities for its use in other application domains as well.
The main advantages of blockchain for its potential use in other domains are
its inherent security mechanisms and immunity to different attacks. A
blockchain relies on a consensus method for agreeing on any new data. Most of
the consensus methods which are currently used for the blockchain of different
cryptocurrencies require high computational power and thus are not apt for
resource-constrained systems.
  In this article, we discuss and survey the various blockchain based consensus
methods that are applicable to resource constrained IoT devices and networks. A
typical IoT network consists of several devices which have limited
computational and communications capabilities. Most often, these devices cannot
perform intensive computations and are starved for bandwidth. Therefore, we
discuss the possible measures that can be taken to reduce the computational
power and convergence time for the underlying consensus methods. We also talk
about some of the alternatives to the public blockchain like private blockchain
and tangle, along with their potential adoption for IoT networks. Furthermore,
we review the existing consensus methods that have been implemented and explore
the possibility of utilizing them to realize a blockchain based IoT network.
Some of the open research challenges are also put forward.

studies typically require either a labeled query dataset or clicks from
multiple users aggregated over the same document. These techniques, however,
are not applicable when manual query labeling is not viable, and aggregated
clicks are unavailable due to the private nature of the document collection,
e.g., in email search scenarios. In this paper, we study how to obtain query

query-dependent ranking models. We first develop a hierarchical clustering
algorithm based on truncated SVD and varimax rotation to obtain coarse-to-fine
query types. Then, we study three query-dependent ranking models, including two
neural models that leverage query type information as additional features, and
one novel multi-task neural model that views query type as the label for the
auxiliary query cluster prediction task. This multi-task model is trained to
simultaneously rank documents and predict query types. Our experiments on tens
of millions of real-world email search queries demonstrate that the proposed

polarized $^3$He beam. Longitudinally polarized $^3$He ions can be used to
measure $g^n_1(x,Q^2)$ in purely inclusive scattering. I also consider
spin-dependent DIS from polarized $^3$He by tagging the spectator proton or
deuteron in coincidence with the scattered electron. A calculation of high
energy scattering from the polarized $^3$He nucleus in the EIC frame is
motivated. Further, this type of measurement can be extended to other polarized
few-body nuclei. High energy spin-dependent scattering from polarized $^3$He
with tagged proton and deuteron could be studied experimentally ahead of EIC
using spin-dependent proton-$^3$He scattering in RHIC, when polarized $^3$He
ions become available.

support services of internet of things by leveraging edge caching and edge
computing. However, current works studying resource management in F-RANs mainly
consider a static system with only one communication mode. Given network
dynamics, resource diversity, and the coupling of resource management with mode
selection, resource management in F-RANs becomes very challenging. Motivated by
the recent development of artificial intelligence, a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) based joint mode selection and resource management approach is
proposed. Each user equipment (UE) can operate either in cloud RAN (C-RAN) mode
or in device-to-device mode, and the resource managed includes both radio
resource and computing resource. The core idea is that the network controller
makes intelligent decisions on UE communication modes and processors' on-off
states with precoding for UEs in C-RAN mode optimized subsequently, aiming at
minimizing long-term system power consumption under the dynamics of edge cache
states. By simulations, the impacts of several parameters, such as learning
rate and edge caching service capability, on system performance are
demonstrated, and meanwhile the proposal is compared with other different
schemes to show its effectiveness. Moreover, transfer learning is integrated
with DRL to accelerate learning process.

ejected gas giant planets. We conduct a suite of numerical simulations of
planetary systems containing three Jupiter-mass planets (with the innermost
planet at 3 AU) up to the point where a planet is ejected from the system. The
ejected planet has an initial system of 100 test-particle moons. We determine
the survival probability of moons at different distances from their host
planet, measure the final distribution of orbital elements, examine the
stability of resonant configurations, and characterize the properties of moons
that are stripped from the planets. We find that moons are likely to survive in
orbits with semi-major axes out beyond 200 planetary radii (0.1 AU in our
case). The orbital inclinations and eccentricities of the surviving moons are
broadly distributed and include nearly hyperbolic orbits and retrograde orbits.
We find that a large fraction of moons in two-body and three-body mean-motion
resonances also survive planetary ejection with the resonance intact. The
moon-planet interactions, especially in the presence of mean-motion resonance,
can keep the interior of the moons molten for billions of years via tidal
flexing, as is seen in the moons of the gas giant planets in the solar system.
Given the possibility that life may exist in the subsurface ocean of the
Galilean satellite Europa, these results have implications for life on the
moons of rogue planets---planets that drift through the galaxy with no host
star.

the sort of safety claims that come with type systems to communications.
However, web-based applications and microservices are often written in a mix of
languages, with type disciplines in a spectrum between static and dynamic
typing. Gradual session types address this mixed setting by providing a
framework which grants seamless transition between statically typed handling of
sessions and any required degree of dynamic typing.
  We propose Gradual GV as a gradually typed extension of the functional
session type system GV. Following a standard framework of gradual typing,
Gradual GV consists of an external language, which relaxes the type system of
GV using dynamic types, and an internal language with casts, for which
operational semantics is given, and a cast-insertion translation from the
former to the latter. We demonstrate type and communication safety as well as
blame safety, thus extending previous results to functional languages with
session-based communication. The interplay of linearity and dynamic types
requires a novel approach to specifying the dynamics of the language.

race, gender, and other protected attributes. One popular strategy is to
estimate disparities after controlling for observed covariates, typically with
a regression model. This approach, however, suffers from two statistical
challenges. First, omitted-variable bias can skew results if the model does not
control for all relevant factors; second, and conversely, included-variable
bias can skew results if the set of controls includes irrelevant factors. Here
we introduce a simple three-step strategy---which we call risk-adjusted
regression---that addresses both concerns in settings where decision makers
have clearly measurable objectives. In the first step, we use all available
covariates to estimate the utility of possible decisions. In the second step,
we measure disparities after controlling for these utility estimates alone,
mitigating the problem of included-variable bias. Finally, in the third step,
we examine the sensitivity of results to unmeasured confounding, addressing
concerns about omitted-variable bias. We demonstrate this method on a detailed
dataset of 2.2 million police stops of pedestrians in New York City, and show
that traditional statistical tests of discrimination can yield misleading
results. We conclude by discussing implications of our statistical approach for
questions of law and policy.

applications. Such system is typically characterized by existences of complex
and varied motion states of different sliding nodes (pulleys), which leads to
significant difficulties for analysis. A very simple but effective linear
complementarity approach isdeveloped. Within this approach, the challenging and
significant issue of determinations of motion states of sliding nodes, as well
as calculations of their sliding lengths, can be handled in a standard linear
complementarity formulation, and can be solved using any available efficient
solver for linear complementarity problem (LCP). The proposed approach
eliminates the need for traditional cumbersome predictor-corrector-based
operations. It also opens a way to study the theory problem such as the
existence and uniqueness of the solution by using complementarity theories,
which is generally absent from existing literature given its complexity. The
uniqueness of the solution has been proved in this work, while the existence
issue remains open and deserves further investigation. Multi examples involving
both static and dynamic analyses are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach, as well as to reveal some novel phenomenon involved
in sliding cable system considering frictions. The results highlight the
ability of the method in accurately handling variegated motion states of
sliding nodes. The proposed approach, we think, has the potential to be a
popular method in dealing with multi-node sliding cable with frictions, given
its simplicity and effectiveness.

introduce drastic changes into the graph structures. Using an illustrative

statistically significant. The characteristic timescale, $\tau$, correlates
mostly with quasar luminosity, its dependence on Rfe is statistically
insignificant. After controlling luminosity and Rfe, the high- and low-FWHM

that Rfe is governed by Eddington ratio and FWHM of Hbeta is mostly determined
by orientation. We then provide new empirical relations between variability
parameters and quasar properties (i.e., luminosity and Rfe). Our new relations
are consistent with the scenario that quasar variability is driven by the
thermal fluctuations in the accretion disk, $\tau$ seems to correspond to the

intrinsic Riemannian metric, but to get the desired embedding $M \subset
\mathbb{R}^3$ up to translations and rotations (the Riemannian metric alone
need not uniquely determine this). In this paper, we demonstrate three generic
methods of molding a flat sheet of thermo-responsive plastic by selective
contraction induced by targeted heating. These methods do not involve any
cutting and gluing, which is a property they share with origami. The first
method is inspired by tailoring, which is the usual method for making garments
out of plain pieces of cloth. Unlike usual tailoring, this method produces the
desired embedding in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and in particular, we get the desired
intrinsic Riemannian metric. The second method just aims to bring about the
desired new Riemannian metric via an appropriate pattern of local contractions,
without directly controlling the embedding. The third method is based on
triangulation, and seeks to induce the desired local distances. This results in
getting the desired embedding in $\mathbb{R}^3$, in particular, it also gives
us the target Riemannian metric. The second and the third methods, and also the
first method for the special case of surfaces of revolution, are algorithmic in
nature. We give a theoretical account of these methods, followed by illustrated
examples of different shapes that were physically molded by these methods.

Recently, users' implicit feedback like `click' or `browse' are considered to

attempts have been made to resolve this issue. Among them, the variational
autoencoders (VAE) approach already achieves a superior performance. However,
the distributions of the encoded latent variables overlap a lot which may
restrict its recommendation ability. To cope with this challenge, this paper
tries to extend the Wasserstein autoencoders (WAE) for collaborative filtering.
Particularly, the loss function of the adapted WAE is re-designed by
introducing two additional loss terms: (1) the mutual information loss between
the distribution of latent variables and the assumed ground truth distribution,
and (2) the L1 regularization loss introduced to restrict the encoded latent
variables to be sparse. Two different cost functions are designed for measuring
the distance between the implicit feedback data and its re-generated version of
data. Experiments are valuated on three widely adopted data sets, i.e., ML-20M,
Netflix and LASTFM. Both the baseline and the state-of-the-art approaches are

feedback with required closed-loop stability, in the general case of
nonstrictly-proper systems. We will show that the extension of the geometric
solution based on the ideas of self boundedness and self hiddenness, which is
the one shown to maximize the number of assignable eigenvalues of the
closed-loop, presents structural differ- ences with respect to the strictly
proper case. The most crucial aspect that emerges in the general case is the
issue of the well-posedness of the feedback interconnection, which obviously
has no counterpart in the strictly proper case. A fundamental property of the
feedback interconnection that has so far remained unnoticed in the literature
is investigated in this paper: the well-posedness condition is decoupled from
the remaining solvability conditions. An important consequence of this fact is
that the well-posedness condition written with respect to the supremal output
nulling and infimal input containing subspaces does not need to be modified
when we consider the solvability conditions of the problem with internal
stability (where one would expect the well-posedness condition to be expressed
in terms of supremal stabilizability and infimal detectability subspaces), and
also when we consider the solution which uses the dual lattice structures of
Basile and Marro.

prior knowledge about the servers' TLS configurations to enforce a fine-grained

enforcing default configurations for the rest of the connections. We implement

of the central kinematics by 19 campaigns. Using the maximum entropy method in
this Letter, we build up a high-quality velocity-delay map of the H$\beta$
emission line in the light curves of the continuum and the line variations
observed between 2015-2016. The map shows the response strength and lags of the
velocity fields of the H$\beta$ emitting regions. The velocity-delay structure
of the map is generally symmetric, with strong red and blue wings at time lag
$\tau \leq 15$ days, a narrower velocity distribution at $\tau \geq 15$ days,
and a deficit of response in the core. This is suggestive of a disk geometry of
the broad-line region (BLR). The relatively weaker H$\beta$ response at the
longer lags in the red side indicates anisotropic emission from the outer part
of the BLR. We also recover the velocity-delay maps of NGC 5548 from the
historical data of 13 years to investigate the long-term variability of its
BLR. In general, the BLR of NGC 5548 was switching between the inflow and
virialized phases in the past years. The resultant maps of seven years reveal
inflow signatures and show decreasing lags, indicating that the changes in the
BLR size are related to the infalling BLR gas. The other four maps show
potential disk signatures which are similar to our map.

NuSTAR, taken at different orbital phases and different luminosities. We find
that the continuum is well described by typical phenomenological models, like a
very strongly absorbed NPEX model. However, for a statistically acceptable
description of the hard X-ray spectrum we require two cyclotron resonant
scattering features (CRSF), one at ~35 keV and the other at ~50 keV. Even
though both features strongly overlap, the good resolution and sensitivity of
NuSTAR allows us to disentangle them at >=99.9% significance. This is the first
time that two CRSFs are seen in GX 301-2. We find that the CRSFs are very
likely independently formed, as their energies are not harmonically related
and, if it were a single line, the deviation from a Gaussian shape would be
very large. We compare our results to archival Suzaku data and find that our
model also provides a good fit to those data. We study the behavior of the
continuum as well as the CRSF parameters as function of pulse phase in seven
phase bins. We find that the energy of the 35 keV CRSF varies smoothly as
function of phase, between 30-38 keV. To explain this variation, we apply a
simple model of the accretion column, taking the altitude of the line-forming
region, the velocity of the in-falling material, and the resulting relativistic
effects into account. We find that in this model the observed energy variation
can be explained simply due to a variation of the projected velocity and
beaming factor of the line forming region towards us.

analytics tasks such as app categorization, recommendation and malware analysis
significantly better. Towards this goal, we design a semi-supervised
Representation Learning (RL) framework named apk2vec to automatically generate
a compact representation (aka profile/embedding) for a given app. More
specifically, apk2vec has the three following unique characteristics which make
it an excellent choice for largescale app profiling: (1) it encompasses
information from multiple semantic views such as API sequences, permissions,
etc., (2) being a semi-supervised embedding technique, it can make use of
labels associated with apps (e.g., malware family or app category labels) to
build high quality app profiles, and (3) it combines RL and feature hashing
which allows it to efficiently build profiles of apps that stream over time
(i.e., online learning). The resulting semi-supervised multi-view hash
embeddings of apps could then be used for a wide variety of downstream tasks
such as the ones mentioned above. Our extensive evaluations with more than
42,000 apps demonstrate that apk2vec's app profiles could significantly
outperform state-of-the-art techniques in four app analytics tasks namely,

we prove the uniqueness of the symmetry axis for nontrivial separable

axial symmetry and monotonicity of separable functions in high dimensional

Conversely, the function with axial symmetry and monotonicity in the ball

monotonicity in the whole space is also separable function. These enable us to
provide easily some examples that separable functions in balls may be just

well as collision avoidance. These constraints couple the TPC variables across
different time slots and UAVs, leading to a challenging large-scale and

that the optimal TPC solution follows the fly-hover-fly strategy, based on
which the problem can be handled by firstly finding an optimal hovering
locations followed by solving a dimension-reduced TPC problem with given

framework was pioneered by Hammett and Perkins PRL 1990, by obtaining closures
of the fluid hierarchy, where the gyrotropic heat flux fluctuations or the
deviation of the 4th-order gyrotropic fluid moment, are expressed through
lower-order fluid moments. To obtain a closure of a fluid model expanded around
a bi-Maxwellian distribution function, the usual plasma dispersion function
$Z(\zeta)$ that appears in kinetic theory or the associated plasma response
function $R(\zeta)=1 + \zeta Z(\zeta)$, have to be approximated with a suitable
Pad\'e approximant in such a way, that the closure is valid for all $\zeta$
values. Such closures are rare, and the original closures of Hammett and
Perkins are often employed. Here we present a complete mapping of all plausible
Landau fluid closures that can be constructed at the level of 4th-order moments
in the gyrotropic limit and we identify the most precise closures. Furthermore,
by considering 1D closures at higher-order moments, we show that it is possible
to reproduce linear Landau damping in the fluid framework to any desired
precision, thus showing convergence of the fluid and collisionless kinetic

dependence of the energy level splitting on a perturbative parameter $\epsilon$
near an $n$-th order exceptional point stimulates the idea of metrology with
arbitrarily high sensitivity, since the susceptibility
$d\epsilon^{1/n}/d\epsilon$ diverges at the exceptional point. Here we
theoretically study the sensitivity of parameter estimation near the
exceptional points, using the exact formalism of quantum Fisher information.
The quantum Fisher information formalism allows the highest sensitivity to be
determined without specifying a specific measurement approach. We find that the
exceptional point bears no dramatic enhancement of the sensitivity. Instead,
the coalescence of the eigenstates exactly counteracts the eigenvalue
susceptibility divergence and makes the sensitivity a smooth function of the
perturbative parameter.

the observed behavioral constraints demonstrated by a teacher agent, and then
uses this constrained policy to guide the reward-based online exploration and

theories on spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes, with or without a
cosmological constant ($\Lambda\geq0$). This is illustrated through the example
of scalar electrodynamics. We first demonstrate that the horizons contribute
additional surface terms to the Gauss law constraint of the theory when gauge
transformations are not required to vanish on the horizons. We then consider
the BRST invariant path integral including these surface terms following the
Hamiltonian BRST formalism. We fix a radiation-like gauge which involves null
components of the electromagnetic field at the horizons. We find that the
presence of the surface terms in the constraint forces the ghost and gauge
fixing actions to include additional surface integrals at the horizons. The
null combination of the gauge fields at the horizons is shown to modify the
ghost number charge of the theory through additional terms at the horizons. We
also demonstrate how one can construct a gauge-fixing fermion which generates
its own nilpotent symmetry transformations, called co-BRST transformations,
that leave the theory invariant. The BRST and co-BRST transformations are
further used to identify dressed (gauge invariant) fields of theory, whose
dressings are affected by the presence of Killing horizons. We conclude with a
discussion of potential applications of our results in soft limits and thermal
field theories on black hole backgrounds.

first-principles electronic-structure results, we find that the
\emph{antiferro-quadrupolar} (AFQ) ordering in CeB$_{6}$ arises from
crystal-field splitting and yields band structure in agreement with
experiments. With interactions of $p$-electrons between Ce and B$_{6}$ being

caused by an exchange interaction induced through spin-orbit interaction, which
also splits J=5/2 state into $\Gamma_{8}$ ground state and $\Gamma_{7}$ excited
state. Within the smallest antiferromagnetic (111) configuration, an
orbital-ordered AFQ state appears during charge self-consistency, and supports
the appearance of `hidden' order. Hydrostatic pressure (either applied or
chemically induced) stabilizes the AFM (AFQ) states over a ferromagnetic one,
as observed at low temperatures.

new threats to the military and the public. To prevent the threats, the
development of the radar to detect the small drones is needed. The frequency
modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar is one of the radar types for the drone
detection. The heterodyne architecture for the FMCW radar is often applied to
resolve the dc offset problem. However, the leakage from a transmitter into a
receiver, the notorious problem of the FMCW radar, is still a challenging
problem. Especially, the phase noise of the leakage increases the noise floor
and deteriorates the signal to noise ratio. In order to mitigate this problem,
in this paper, the stationary point concentration technique is proposed.
Without additional hardware, the proposed technique can be implemented through
frequency planning and digital signal processing. The results show that the
proposed technique significantly lowers the noise floor over the desired range
domain.

subjecting the front face of a small sample to a heat pulse of radiant energy
and recording the resulting temperature rise on the opposite (rear) surface.
For the adiabatic case, the widely-used standard approach estimates the thermal
diffusivity from the rear-surface temperature rise history by calculating the
half rise time: the time required for the temperature rise to reach one half of
its maximum value. In this article, we develop a novel alternative approach by
expressing the thermal diffusivity exactly in terms of the area enclosed by the
rear-surface temperature rise curve and the steady-state temperature over time.
Approximating this integral numerically leads to a simple formula for the
thermal diffusivity involving the rear-surface temperature rise history. Using
synthetic experimental data we demonstrate that the new formula produces
estimates of the thermal diffusivity - for a typical test case - that are more
accurate and less variable than the standard approach. The article concludes by
briefly commenting on extension of the new method to account for heat losses
from the sample.

phase retarder was implemented to determine the birefringence of silk fibers
with the high 2 micrometers spatial resolution. The measurement was carried out
with silk fiber (the optical slow axis) and the slow axis of the LC retarder
set parallel (a perpendicular alignment can also be used). The direct fit of
the transmission data provides a high fidelity determination of birefringence,
$Dn = 1.63\times 10^{-2}$ (with 2% uncertainty) of the brown silk fiber
(Antheraea pernyi) averaged over the wavelength range $l =$ (425-625) nm. By
measuring retardance at four wavelengths it was possible to determine the true
value of the birefringence of a thick sample when an optical path may include
large number of wavelengths ($2p$ cycles in phase). The numerical procedures
and required hardware are described for the do-it-yourself assembly of the
imaging polariscope at a fractional budget compared with commercial units.

  Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Physiological Biosignals","40th International Engineering in Medicine and Biology Conference
  (EMBC 2018)",,,,"cs.HC eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been suggested that changes in physiological arousal precede
potentially dangerous aggressive behavior in youth with autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) who are minimally verbal (MV-ASD). The current work tests this
hypothesis through time-series analyses on biosignals acquired prior to
proximal aggression onset. We implement ridge-regularized logistic regression
models on physiological biosensor data wirelessly recorded from 15 MV-ASD youth
over 64 independent naturalistic observations in a hospital inpatient unit. Our
results demonstrate proof-of-concept, feasibility, and incipient validity
predicting aggression onset 1 minute before it occurs using global,
person-dependent, and hybrid classifier models.

guarantee of stable driving. Compared with the visual odometry (VO), the LiDAR
odometry (LO) has the advantages of higher accuracy and better stability.
However, 2D LO is only suitable for the indoor environment, and 3D LO has less
efficiency in general. Both are not suitable for the online localization of an
autonomous vehicle in an outdoor driving environment. In this paper, a direct
LO method based on the 2.5D grid map is proposed. The fast semi-dense direct
method proposed for VO is employed to register two 2.5D maps. Experiments show
that this method is superior to both the 3D-NDT and LOAM in the outdoor
environment.

convert convolution kernels to memristor-based circuits, which minimizes the

simulation for all convolution layers in ResNet-20, we found that 8-bit ADC/DAC

nanosheets decorated with a controlled density of monodispersed small gold
nanoparticles, was fabricated via electrodeposition, for the highly sensitive
detection of miRNA-21. The size and interparticle spacing of AuNPs was
optimized by controlling nucleation and growth rates through tuning of
deposition-potential and Au-precursor concentration and by getting simultaneous
feedback from morphological and electrochemical activity studies. The sensing
strategy, involved the selective immobilization of thiolated capture probe DNA
(CP) at AuNPs and hybridization of CP to a part of miRNA target, whereas the
remaining part of the target was complementary to a signaling non-labelled DNA
sequence. Chronocoulometry provided precise quantification of nucleic acids at
each step of the sensor assay by interrogating [Ru(NH3)6]3+ electrostatically
bound to phosphate backbones of oligonucleotides. A detailed and systematic
optimization study demonstrated that the thinnest and smallest MoS2 NSs
improved the sensitivity of the AuNP@MoS2 sensor achieving an impressive
detection limit of 100 aM, which is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of
bare Au electrode and also enhanced the DNA-miRNA hybridization efficiency by
25%. Such improved performance can be attributed to the controlled packing
density of CPs achieved by their self -assembly on AuNPs, large interparticle
density, small size and the intimate coupling between AuNPs and MoS2. Alongside
the outstanding sensitivity, the sensor exhibited excellent selectivity down to
femtomolar concentrations, for discriminating complementary miRNA-21 target in
a complex system composed of different foreign targets including mismatched and
non-complementary miRNA-155. These advantages make our sensor a promising
contender in the point of care miRNA sensor family for medical diagnostics.
