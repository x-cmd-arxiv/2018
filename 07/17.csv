be systematically extracted from crossing kernels. To this end, we underline a
connection between: Wilson polynomials (which naturally appear when considering
the crossing kernels given recently in arXiv:1804.09334), the spectral integral
in the conformal partial wave expansion, and Wilson functions. Using this
connection, we determine closed form expressions for the OPE data when the

and in particular the anomalous dimensions of double-twist operators of the

both leading and sub-leading twist. The OPE data are expressed in terms of
Wilson functions, which naturally appear as a spectral integral of a Wilson

established concept of Dual Dynamic Programming (DDP) in two ways. First, in
contrast to the linear costs, dynamics, and constraints of standard DDP, we
consider problems in which all of these can be polynomial functions. Second, we
allow the state trajectory to be described by probability distributions rather
than point values, and return approximate value functions fitted to these. The
algorithm is in part an adaptation of sum-of-squares techniques used in the
approximate dynamic programming literature. It alternates between a forward
simulation through the horizon, in which the moments of the state distribution
are propagated through a succession of single-stage problems, and a backward
recursion, in which a new polynomial function is derived for each stage using
the moments of the state as fixed data. The value function approximation
returned for a given stage is the point-wise maximum of all polynomials derived
for that stage. This contrasts with the piecewise affine functions derived in
conventional DDP. We prove key convergence properties of the new algorithm, and
validate it in simulation on two case studies related to the optimal operation
of energy storage devices with nonlinear characteristics. The first is a small
borehole storage problem, for which multiple value function approximations can
be compared. The second is a larger problem, for which conventional discretized
dynamic programming is intractable.

reconcile the apparent differences between the running times of spatial search

this approach improves the algorithmic running time for several instances, it
cannot provide a generic quadratic speedup for any $P$. Secondly, using the
framework of interpolated Markov chains, we provide a new spatial search
algorithm by continuous-time quantum walk which can find a marked node on any

multiple nodes are marked, the algorithmic running time scales as the square
root of a quantity known as the extended hitting time. Our results establish a

for computing solvation free energies in implicit solvents. One of the reasons
it has not received nearly as much attention as quantum density functional
theory for implicit electron densities is the paucity of basis set expansions
for this theory. This work constructs a minimal Hilbert space version of the
Ornstein-Zernike theory over the complete spatial, rotational, and internal
conformational space that leaves the choice of basis open. The basis is minimal
in the sense that it is isomorphic to a choice of molecular property space
(i.e. moments of the distribution), and does not require auxiliary grids. This
can be exploited, since there are usually only a few `important' properties for
determining the structure and energetics of a molecular fluid. Two novel basis
expansions are provided which emphasize either the multipolar expansion (most
useful for flexible molecules) or the rotational distribution (most useful for
rigid bodies described using quaternions). The perspective of this work shows
that radial truncation of the Bessel series over translation space determines
an analytical extrapolation of these functions to the origin in reciprocal
space. We provide a new density functional theory that naturally fits the
moment-based, matrix approach. Three diverse applications are presented:
relating the present approach to traditional rotational invariants,
demonstrating the stability of convex optimization on the density functional,
and finding analytical expression for dispersion contributions to the solvation
free energies of point polarizable dipoles.

discussed in the context of doped semiconductor systems, such as

anisotropic chemical phase separation accounts for the magnitude of transition

$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n)$-size, $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{n})$-query-time

answers queries in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(q)$ time. For single vertex failures

improves over the previously best known tradeoff of Baswana et al. [SODA 2012]

particularly in those in which measurement procedures are ill-defined. By
contrast, in ontological models of nature, measurement results are independent
of the procedure used to obtain them. Quantum mechanics, as a model of nature,
is notoriously ambiguous in this regard. If we assume that all measurement
results can be expressed in terms of pointer readings, then any useful ontology
would need to unambiguously specify the positions of things. But the positions
of pointers are ill-defined in many relativistic and cosmological settings. One
potential solution to this problem presents itself in the solutions to the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation as developed by Hartle and Hawking. In this article we
introduce such a model in which these solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation
serve as the ontology of the model. We then show that, for any model that
admits these solutions as beables, the global preservation of Lorentz
invariance is incompatible with global determinism. However, we also show that
an Everett-like interpretation that allows for all possible mappings of the
matter field to the geometry and for all possible foliations of these mappings

early diagnosis of lung cancer. Manual examination is highly time-consuming and
error prone, calling for computer-aided detection, both to improve efficiency
and reduce misdiagnosis. Over the years, a range of systems have been proposed,
mostly following a two-phase paradigm with: 1) candidate detection, 2) false
positive reduction. Recently, deep learning has become a dominant force in
algorithm development. As for candidate detection, prior art was mainly based
on the two-stage Faster R-CNN framework, which starts with an initial sub-net
to generate a set of class-agnostic region proposals, followed by a second
sub-net to perform classification and bounding-box regression. In contrast, we
abandon the conventional two-phase paradigm and two-stage framework altogether
and propose to train a single network for end-to-end nodule detection instead,
without transfer learning or further post-processing. Our feature learning
model is a modification of the ResNet and feature pyramid network combined,
powered by RReLU activation. The major challenge is the condition of extreme
inter-class and intra-class sample imbalance, where the positives are
overwhelmed by a large negative pool, which is mostly composed of easy and a
handful of hard negatives. Direct training on all samples can seriously
undermine training efficacy. We propose a patch-based sampling strategy over a
set of regularly updating anchors, which narrows sampling scope to all
positives and only hard negatives, effectively addressing this issue. As a
result, our approach substantially outperforms prior art in terms of both
accuracy and speed. Finally, the prevailing FROC evaluation over [1/8, 1/4,
1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8] false positives per scan, is far from ideal in real clinical
environments. We suggest FROC over [1, 2, 4] false positives as a better

absolute cross sections show slightly different jet transverse momentum spectra

transverse momentum dependence, the normalized cross section for ungroomed jets

below 30% of the transverse momentum. The normalized cross section for groomed

Semi-analytical calculations of the jet mass beyond leading logarithmic

To gain analytical insight we analyse a modified form of the Mises truss, a
single-degree-of-freedom structure, which features an `inverted' shape that
snaps to a `natural' shape. Motivated by the anomalously slow snap-through
shown by spherical elastic caps, we consider a thought experiment in which the
truss is first indented to an inverted state and allowed to relax while a
specified displacement is maintained; the constraint of an imposed displacement
is then removed. Focussing on the dynamics for the limit in which the timescale
of viscous relaxation is much larger than the characteristic elastic timescale,
we show that two types of snap-through are possible: the truss either
immediately snaps back over the elastic timescale or it displays
`pseudo-bistability', in which it undergoes a slow creeping motion before
rapidly accelerating. In particular, we demonstrate that accurately determining
when pseudo-bistability occurs requires the consideration of inertial effects
immediately after the indentation force is removed. Our analysis also explains
many basic features of pseudo-bistability that have been observed previously in
experiments and numerical simulations; for example, we show that
pseudo-bistability occurs in a narrow parameter range at the bifurcation
between bistability and monostability, so that the dynamics is naturally
susceptible to critical slowing down. We then study an analogous thought
experiment performed on a continuous arch, showing that the qualitative
features of the snap-through dynamics are well captured by the truss model. In
addition, we analyse experimental and numerical data of viscoelastic
snap-through times reported in the literature. Combining these approaches
suggests that our conclusions may also extend to more complex viscoelastic
structures used in morphing applications.

formation, but they are also expected to change over time due to the dynamical
evolution of the Galaxy. Stellar orbits can be quantified by three dynamical
actions, J_r, L_z, and J_z, which provide measures of the orbital eccentricity,
guiding radius, and non-planarity, respectively. Changes in these dynamical
actions over time reflect the strength and efficiency of the evolutionary
processes that drive stellar redistributions. We examine how dynamical actions
of stars are correlated with their age using two samples of stars with
well-determined ages: 78 solar twin stars (with ages to ~5%) and 4376 stars
from the APOKASC2 sample (~20%). We compute actions using spectroscopic radial
velocities from previous surveys and parallax and proper motion measurements
from Gaia DR2. We find weak gradients in all actions with stellar age, of (7.51
+/- 0.52, -29.0 +/- 1.83, 1.54 +/- 0.18) kpc km/s/Gyr for J_r, L_z, and J_z,
respectively. There is, however, significant scatter in the action-age
relation. We caution that our results will be affected by the restricted
spatial extent of our sample, particularly in the case of J_z. Nevertheless,
these action-age gradients and their associated variances provide strong
constraints on the efficiency of the mechanisms that drive the redistribution
of stellar orbits over time and demonstrate that actions are informative as to
stellar age. The shallow action-age gradients combined with the large
dispersion in each action at a given age, however, renders the prospect of age
inference from orbits of individual stars bleak. Using the precision
measurements of [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] for our stars we investigate the
abundance-action relationship and find weak correlations. Similar to our
stellar age results, dynamical actions afford little discriminating power
between low- and high-$\alpha$ stars.

this model, the answer strings are not returned through noiseless bit pipes,
but rather through \emph{noisy} memoryless channels. We aim at characterizing
the PIR capacity for this model as a function of the statistical information
measures of the noisy channels such as entropy and mutual information. We
derive a general upper bound for the retrieval rate in the form of a max-min
optimization. We use the achievable schemes for the PIR problem under
asymmetric traffic constraints and random coding arguments to derive a general
lower bound for the retrieval rate. The upper and lower bounds match for $M=2$
and $M=3$, for any $N$, and any noisy channel. The results imply that
separation between channel coding and retrieval is optimal except for adapting
the traffic ratio from the databases. We refer to this as \emph{almost
separation}. Next, we consider the private information retrieval problem from
multiple access channels (MAC-PIR). In MAC-PIR, the database responses reach
the user through a multiple access channel (MAC) that mixes the responses
together in a stochastic way. We show that for the additive MAC and the
conjunction/disjunction MAC, channel coding and retrieval scheme are
\emph{inseparable} unlike in NPIR. We show that the retrieval scheme depends on
the properties of the MAC, in particular on the linearity aspect. For both
cases, we provide schemes that achieve the full capacity without any loss due
to the privacy constraint, which implies that the user can exploit the nature
of the channel to improve privacy. Finally, we show that the full unconstrained
capacity is not always attainable by determining the capacity of the selection
channel.

one-pass of the VIMOS instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), the
galaxies observed only represent approximately 47\% of the parent target
sample, with a distribution imprinted with the pattern of the VIMOS slitmask.
Correcting for the effect on clustering has previously been achieved using an
approximate approach developed using mock catalogues. Pairwise inverse
probability (PIP) weighting has recently been proposed by Bianchi & Percival to
correct for missing galaxies, and we apply it to mock VIPERS catalogues to show
that it accurately corrects the clustering for the VIMOS effects, matching the
clustering measured from the observed sample to that of the parent. We then
apply PIP-weighting to the VIPERS data, and fit the resulting monopole and
quadrupole moments of the galaxy two-point correlation function with respect to
the line-of-sight, making measurements of RSD. The results are close to
previous measurements, showing that the previous approximate methods used by
the VIPERS team are sufficient given the errors obtained on the RSD parameter.

measure, finds optimal values of a function's argument (nodes) and the
corresponding weights. In contrast, the Lebesgue quadrature developed in this
paper, finds optimal values of function (value-nodes) and the corresponding
weights. The Gaussian quadrature groups sums by function argument; it can be
viewed as a $n$-point discrete measure, producing the Riemann integral. The
Lebesgue quadrature groups sums by function value; it can be viewed as a
$n$-point discrete distribution, producing the Lebesgue integral.
Mathematically, the problem is reduced to a generalized eigenvalue problem:
Lebesgue quadrature value-nodes are the eigenvalues and the corresponding
weights are the square of the averaged eigenvectors. A numerical estimation of
an integral as the Lebesgue integral is especially advantageous when analyzing
irregular and stochastic processes. The approach separates the outcome
(value-nodes) and the probability of the outcome (weight). For this reason, it
is especially well-suited for the study of non-Gaussian processes. The software

The separation distribution of MS/MS systems is nearly consistent with a single
power-law of slope $-1.6$ over at least $500 < s/{\rm AU} < 50,000$, with
marginal steepening at $s > 10,000$ AU. In contrast, the separation

binary population synthesis models, we show that these breaks are unlikely to
be caused by external factors but can be explained if the WDs incur a kick of
$\sim$ 0.75 km s$^{-1}$ during their formation, presumably due to asymmetric

the physical properties of the massive molecular (H$_2$) outflow. We discover
that the receding and approaching sides of the H$_2$ outflow, aligned
east-west, exceed 10 kpc in their total extent. High resolution ($0.24""$)
[CI](1-0) line images surprisingly reveal that the outflow emission peaks
between the two AGNs, rather than on either of the two, and that it dominates
the velocity field in this nuclear region. We combine the [CI](1-0) and CO(1-0)
data to constrain the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$) in the
outflow, which is on average $2.1\pm1.2~\rm M_{\odot} (K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}$.
We estimate that $60\pm20$ % of the total H$_2$ gas reservoir of NGC6240 is
entrained in the outflow, for a resulting mass-loss rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm
out}=2500\pm1200~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$ $\equiv 50\pm30$ SFR. This energetics rules
out a solely star formation-driven wind, but the puzzling morphology challenges
a classic radiative-mode AGN feedback scenario. For the quiescent gas we
compute $\langle\alpha_{\rm CO}\rangle = 3.2\pm1.8~\rm M_{\odot}
(K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}$, which is at least twice the value commonly employed
for (U)LIRGs. We observe a tentative trend of increasing $r_{21}\equiv
L^{\prime}_{\rm CO(2-1)}/L^{\prime}_{\rm CO(1-0)}$ ratios with velocity
dispersion and measure $r_{21}>1$ in the outflow, whereas $r_{21}\simeq1$ in
the quiescent gas. We propose that molecular outflows are the location of the
warmer, strongly unbound phase that partially reduces the opacity of the CO
lines in (U)LIRGs, hence driving down their global $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ and
increasing their $r_{21}$ values.

demonstrate that the two methods are consistent with each other in the regime
where both can be applied. The distances to 15 out of 20 galaxies with stable
measurements are consistent with that of the targeted group within errors. This
suggests that assuming group membership based solely on projected proximity is
~75% successful in this regime. The galaxies are nearly round, with a median

novel statistical techniques for estimating their ages. In this paper, we infer
ages for known eccentric-planet-hosting M dwarfs using a combination of
kinematics and $\alpha$-element-enrichment, both shown to correlate with age
for Sun-like FGK stars. We calibrate our method on FGK stars in a Bayesian

the CARMENES exoplanet survey and a recently developed [Ti/Fe] calibration
utilizing individual Ti I and Fe I absorption lines in $Y$ band. Tidal effects
are expected to circularize the orbits of short-period planets on short
timescales; however, we find a number of mildly eccentric, close-in planets
orbiting old ($\sim$8 Gyr) stars. For these systems, we use our ages to
constrain the tidal dissipation parameter of the planets, $Q_\mathrm{p}$. For
two mini-Neptune planets, GJ 176b and GJ 536b, we find they have $Q_\mathrm{p}$

constrain the $Q_\mathrm{p}$ to be $>10^5$, in good agreement with constraints
from its inferred tidal heating. We find that GJ 876d has likely undergone

mass $m$. The central regions of SFDM haloes are dominated by solitons with
characteristic densities that increase with increasing halo mass and asymptote
to CDM-like profiles at large radii. For scalar field masses $m \sim 10^{-22}$
eV, consistent with large-scale structure observations, $M_{\rm h} \sim 10^{10}

where feedback is less effective. However, higher-mass SFDM haloes with $M_{\rm

observationally relevant radii. We use rotation curves of $V \sim 100$ km

cusp/core and central density problems seen in CDM at this scale. We conclude
that if the conventional cosmological SFDM scaling relations are correct, then
baryonic feedback is required to lower densities in SFDM haloes even more so
than in CDM. This motivates cosmological and self-consistent hydrodynamic
simulations of SFDM to determine whether central soliton structure can be
altered by realistic feedback implementations.

The double-layer ARC ensures a reflectance of less than 1% at the surface
substrate over the FPI bandwidth. This low reflectance is required to achieve
broadband capability and to mitigate contaminating resonances from the silicon
surface. Two silicon substrates with their metalized surfaces facing each other
and held parallel with an adjustable separation will compose the FPI. To create
an FPI with nearly uniform finesse over the FPI bandwidth, we use a combination
of inductive and capacitive gold meshes evaporated onto the silicon substrate.
We also consider the use of niobium as a superconducting reflective mesh for
long wavelengths to eliminate ohmic losses at each reflection in the resonating
cavity of the FPI and thereby increase overall transmission. We develop these
silicon-substrate based FPIs for use in ground (e.g. CCAT-prime), air (e.g.
HIRMES), and future space-based telescopes (e.g. the Origins Space Telescope
concept). Such FPIs are well suited for spectroscopic imaging with the upcoming

performed a spectroscopic analysis based on both phenomenological and
physically motivated models employing toroidal and spherical geometry for the
obscurer. In all the modelings, the source exhibits a Compton-thick column
density $N_{\rm H} \gtrsim 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, a 2-10 keV luminosity
$L_{2-10}\approx2\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ , and a prominent soft excess
($\sim5-10$ % of the primary radiative output), which translates into a
luminosity $\sim10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We modeled the spectral energy
distribution from 1.6 to 850 $\mu m$ using a clumpy two-phase dusty torus model
plus a modified blackbody to account for emission powered by star formation in
the far-infrared. We employed several geometrical configurations consistent
with those applied in the X-ray analysis. In all cases we obtained a bolometric
luminosity $L_{\rm bol}\approx3-5\times10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which confirms
the hyperluminous nature of this active galactic nucleus. Finally, we estimate
a prodigious star formation rate of $\sim$3000 $M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$, which is
consistent with the rates inferred for $z\approx2-4$ hyperluminous type I
quasars. The heavily obscured nature, together with $L_{\rm bol}$, the ratio of
X-ray to mid-infrared luminosity, the rest-frame optical morphology, and the
host star formation rate are indicative of its evolutionary stage. We can
interpret this as a late-stage merger event in the transitional,
dust-enshrouded, evolutionary phase eventually leading to an optically bright
AGN.

with $SU_\mathcal{M}(2)\times E_{N_f+1}$ flavor symmetry, on a generic Riemann
surface that preserves four supercharges. The five-dimensional SCFTs are
obtained from the decoupling limit of $N$ D4-branes probing a geometry of
$N_f<8$ D8-branes and an O8-plane. In addition to the R-symmetry, we can also
twist the flavor symmetry by turning on background flux on the Riemann surface.
In particular, in the string theory construction of the five-dimensional SCFTs,
the background flux for the $SU_\mathcal{M}(2)$ has a geometric origin, similar
to the topological twist of the R-symmetry. We argue that the resulting
low-energy three-dimensional theories describe the dynamics on the world-volume
of the $N$ D4-branes wrapped on the Riemann surface in the O8/D8 background.
The Riemann surface can be described as a curve in a Calabi-Yau three-fold that
is a sum of two line bundles over it. This allows for an explicit construction
of $AdS_4$ solutions in massive IIA supergravity dual to the world-volume
theories, thereby providing strong evidence that the three-dimensional SCFTs
exist in the low-energy limit of the compactification of the five-dimensional
SCFTs. We compute observables such as the free energy and the scaling
dimensions of operators dual to D2-brane probes; these have non-trivial
dependence on the twist parameter for the $U(1)$ in $SU_\mathcal{M}(2)$. The
free energy exhibits the $N^{5/2}$ scaling that is emblematic of

planetary properties with host star metallicity for close-in planets. By
incorporating knowledge of the properties of the planetary radius gap
identified by the CKS survey, we are able to investigate the properties of
planetary cores and their gaseous envelopes separately. Our primary findings
are that the solid core masses of planets are higher around higher metallicity
stars and that these more massive cores were able to accrete larger gas
envelopes. Furthermore, investigating the recently reported result that planets
with radii in the range (2-6Rearth) are more common at short periods around
higher metallicity stars in detail, we find that the average host star
metallicity of H/He atmosphere-hosting planets increases smoothly inside an
orbital period of ~20 days. We interpret the location of the metallicity
increase within the context of atmospheric photoevaporation: higher metallicity
stars are likely to host planets with higher atmospheric metallicity, which
increases the cooling in the photoevaporative outflow, lowering the mass-loss
rates. Therefore, planets with higher metallicity atmospheres are able to
resist photoevaporation at shorter orbital periods. Finally, we find evidence
at 2.8 sigma that planets that do not host H/He atmospheres at long periods are
more commonly found around lower metallicity stars. Such planets are difficult
to explain by photoevaporative stripping of planets which originally accreted
H/He atmospheres. Alternatively, this population of planets could be
representative of planets that formed in a terrestrial-like fashion, after the
gas disc dispersed.

models with spatial disorder. The models we consider are unitarily related to a
system of free fermions and are thus manifestly integrable. We demonstrate that
out-of-time-order correlators can spread slowly beyond the single-particle
localization length, despite the absence of many-body interactions. This
phenomenon is shown to be due to the nonlocal relationship between elementary
excitations and the physical degrees of freedom. We argue that this
non-locality becomes relevant for time-dependent correlation functions. In
addition, a slow logarithmic-in-time growth of the entanglement entropy is
observed following a quench from an unentangled initial state. We attribute
this growth to the presence of strong zero modes, which gives rise to an
exponential hierarchy of time scales upon ensemble averaging. Our work on
disordered integrable systems complements the rich phenomenology of information

reconstruction of a given bulk operator will often necessarily depend on the
choice of black hole microstate, an example of state dependence. As a result,
whether a given bulk operator can be reconstructed on the boundary at all can
depend on whether the black hole is described by a pure state or thermal
ensemble. We refine this dichotomy, demonstrating that the same boundary
operator can often be used for large subspaces of black hole microstates,
corresponding to a constant fraction $\alpha$ of the black hole entropy. In the
Schrodinger picture, the boundary subregion encodes the $\alpha$-bits (a
concept from quantum information) of a bulk region containing the black hole
and bounded by extremal surfaces. These results have important consequences for
the structure of AdS/CFT and for quantum information. Firstly, they imply that
the bulk reconstruction is necessarily only approximate and allow us to place
non-perturbative lower bounds on the error when doing so. Second, they provide
a simple and tractable limit in which the entanglement wedge is
state-dependent, but in a highly controlled way. Although the state dependence
of operators comes from ordinary quantum error correction, there are clear
connections to the Papadodimas-Raju proposal for understanding operators behind
black hole horizons. In tensor network toy models of AdS/CFT, we see how state
dependence arises from the bulk operator being `pushed' through the black hole
itself. Finally, we show that black holes provide the first `explicit' examples
of capacity-achieving $\alpha$-bit codes. Unintuitively, Hawking radiation
always reveals the $\alpha$-bits of a black hole as soon as possible. In an
appendix, we apply a result from the quantum information literature to prove
that entanglement wedge reconstruction can be made exact to all orders in
$1/N$.

of the metric in the context of the generalized Proca theory. The constraint
restricts the form of the gravity Lagrangian, the way the electromagnetism
couples to the gravity sector on cosmological backgrounds, or in general a
combination of both. Since different ways of coupling matter to gravity are
typically related to each other by disformal transformations, it is important
to understand how the structure of the generalized Proca Lagrangian changes
under disformal transformations. For disformal transformations with constant
coefficients we provide the complete transformation rule of the Lagrangian. We
find that additional terms, which were considered as beyond generalized Proca
in the literature, are generated by the transformations. Once these additional
terms are included, on the other hand, the structure of the gravity Lagrangian
is preserved under the transformations. We then derive the transformation rules
for the sound speeds of the scalar, vector and tensor perturbations on a
homogeneous and isotropic background. We explicitly show that they transform
following the natural expectation of metric transformations, that is, according
to the transformation of the background lightcone structure. We end by arguing
that inhomogeneities due to structures in the universe, e.g. dark matter halos,
generically changes the speed of gravitational waves from its cosmological
value. We give a rough estimate of the effect of inhomogeneities and find that
the fine-tuning should not depend on the background or that the fine-tuned
theory has to be further fine-tuned to pass the tight constraint.

the CBS ([1-particle] complete basis set) limit, CCSD and CCSD(F12*) agree to
within their respective uncertainties (about \pm0.04 kcal/mol) due to residual

correlation. The observed basis set convergence behavior results from the
superposition of a rapidly converging, attractive, CCSD[F12]--CCSD-F12b
difference (consisting mostly of third-order terms), and a more slowly
converging, repulsive, fourth-order difference between CCSD(F12*) and

clarify the influence of recommendation systems on behavioral changes. We
compared our proposed model with the target data, verified it, and evaluated
the effect of recommendation systems on user behavior. Our simulation results
showed that diversity usually decreases, but collaborative filtering can
suppress the diversity decrease more effectively than non-recommendations. We
also found that the category that users are interested in the most is easily
strengthened and is one factor that leads to less diversity, and a
recommendation method that can suppress the strengthening of the category that
users are interested in the most will be effective for developing a
recommendation system that can suppress diversity decreasing.

D\'ail \'Eireann is the principal chamber of the Irish parliament. The 31st
D\'ail was in session from March 11th, 2011 to February 6th, 2016. Many of the
members of the D\'ail were active on social media and many were Twitter users
who followed other members of the D\'ail. The pattern of following amongst
these politicians provides insights into political alignment within the D\'ail.
We propose a new model, called the generalized latent space stochastic
blockmodel, which extends and generalizes both the latent space model and the
stochastic blockmodel to study social media connections between members of the
D\'ail. The probability of an edge between two nodes in a network depends on
their respective class labels as well as latent positions in an unobserved
latent space. The proposed model is capable of representing transitivity,
clustering, as well as disassortative mixing. A Bayesian method with Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling is proposed for estimation of model parameters.
Model selection is performed using the WAIC criterion and models of different
number of classes or dimensions of latent space are compared. We use the model
to study Twitter following relationships of members of the D\'ail and interpret
structure found in these relationships. We find that the following
relationships amongst politicians is mainly driven by past and present
political party membership. We also find that the modeling outputs are
informative when studying voting within the D\'ail.

that it is computationally feasible for a bad actor to fool a DRL policy into
behaving sub optimally. Although certain adversarial attacks with specific
attack models have been addressed, most studies are only interested in off-line
optimization in the data space (e.g., example fitting, distillation). This
paper introduces a Meta-Learned Advantage Hierarchy (MLAH) framework that is
attack model-agnostic and more suited to reinforcement learning, via handling
the attacks in the decision space (as opposed to data space) and directly
mitigating learned bias introduced by the adversary. In MLAH, we learn separate
sub-policies (nominal and adversarial) in an online manner, as guided by a
supervisory master agent that detects the presence of the adversary by
leveraging the advantage function for the sub-policies. We demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm enables policy learning with significantly lower bias as
compared to the state-of-the-art policy learning approaches even in the
presence of heavy state information attacks. We present algorithm analysis and
simulation results using popular OpenAI Gym environments.

spatial distribution of star-forming, quiescent, green valley, starburst and
post-starburst spaxels as a function of stellar mass and morphology to see
where and in what types of galaxy star formation is occurring. The spatial
distribution of star-formation is dependent primarily on stellar mass, with a
noticeable change in the distribution at \mstar$>10^{10}$\msun. Galaxies above
this mass have an increasing fraction of regions that are forming stars with
increasing radius, whereas lower mass galaxies have a constant fraction of star
forming regions with radius. Our findings support a picture of inside-out
growth and quenching at high masses. We find that morphology (measured via
concentration) correlates with the fraction of star-forming spaxels, but not
with their radial distribution. We find (post-)starburst regions are more
common outside of the galaxy centre, are preferentially found in asymmetric
galaxies, and have lower gas-phase metallicity than other regions, consistent
with interactions triggering starbursts and driving low metallicity gas into
regions at $<1.5R_e$.

model performance can fail to reflect that of the smaller subsets, and slicing
allows users to analyze the model performance on a more granular-level. Unlike

general 4D maps. We show that the bounded dynamics of Moser's family is
organized by a codimension-three bifurcation that creates four fixed points---a
bifurcation analogous to a doubled, saddle-center---which we call a
quadfurcation.
  In some sectors of parameter space a quadfurcation creates four fixed points
from none, and in others it is the collision of a pair of fixed points that
re-emerge as two or possibly four. In the simplest case the dynamics is similar
to the cross product of a pair of H\'enon maps, but more typically the
stability of the created fixed points does not have this simple form. Up to two
of the fixed points can be doubly-elliptic and be surrounded by bubbles of
invariant two-tori; these dominate the set of bounded orbits. The quadfurcation
can also create one or two complex-unstable (Krein) fixed points.
  Special cases of the quadfurcation correspond to a pair of weakly coupled
H\'enon maps near their saddle-center bifurcations. The quadfurcation also
occurs in the creation of accelerator modes in a 4D standard map.

segmentation of laryngeal soft tissue with a mean IoU of 84.7 %. The highest
efficiency was achieved by ENet with a mean inference time of 9.22 ms per
image. It is shown that 10 additional images from a new patient are sufficient
for patient-specific fine-tuning. Conclusion CNN-based methods for semantic
segmentation are applicable to endoscopic images of laryngeal soft tissue. The
segmentation can be used for active constraints or to monitor morphological
changes and autonomously detect pathologies. Further improvements could be
achieved by using a larger dataset or training the models in a self-supervised
manner on additional unlabeled data.

Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) in 153 square degrees of data release 1, 2 and 3. We
have performed a seeing convolved 2D single S\'ersic fit to the galaxy images
in the 4 photometric bands (u, g, r, i) observed by KiDS, by selecting high
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N > 50) systems in every bands.
  We have classified galaxies as spheroids and disc-dominated by combining
their spectral energy distribution properties and their S\'ersic index. Using
photometric redshifts derived from a machine learning technique, we have
determined the evolution of the effective radius, \Re\ and stellar mass, \mst,
versus redshift, for both mass complete samples of spheroids and disc-dominated
galaxies up to z ~ 0.6.
  Our results show a significant evolution of the structural quantities at
intermediate redshift for the massive spheroids ($\mbox{Log}\ M_*/M_\odot>11$,
Chabrier IMF), while almost no evolution has found for less massive ones
($\mbox{Log}\ M_*/M_\odot < 11$). On the other hand, disc dominated systems
show a milder evolution in the less massive systems ($\mbox{Log}\ M_*/M_\odot <
11$) and possibly no evolution of the more massive systems. These trends are
generally consistent with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations and
independent datasets out to redshift z ~ 0.6, although in some cases the
scatter of the data is large to drive final conclusions.
  These results, based on 1/10 of the expected KiDS area, reinforce precedent
finding based on smaller statistical samples and show the route toward more
accurate results, expected with the the next survey releases.

investigated repeatability of radiomics features under various preprocessing

different image pre-filtering, 2D vs 3D texture computation, and different bin
widths for image discretization. Image registration as means to re-identify
regions of interest across time points was evaluated against human-expert
segmented regions in both time points. Even though we found many radiomics
features and preprocessing combinations with a high repeatability (Intraclass
Correlation Coefficient (ICC) > 0.85), our results indicate that overall the
repeatability is highly sensitive to the processing parameters (under certain
configurations, it can be below 0.0). Image normalization, using a variety of
approaches considered, did not result in consistent improvements in
repeatability. There was also no consistent improvement of repeatability
through the use of pre-filtering options, or by using image registration
between timepoints to improve consistency of the region of interest

succinct and rigorous descriptions of probabilistic models and inference tasks.
Several probabilistic programming languages, including Anglican, Church or
Hakaru, derive their expressiveness from a powerful combination of continuous
distributions, conditioning, and higher-order functions. Although very
important for practical applications, these combined features raise fundamental
challenges for program semantics and verification. Several recent works offer
promising answers to these challenges, but their primary focus is on semantical
issues.
  In this paper, we take a step further and we develop a set of program logics,
named PPV, for proving properties of programs written in an expressive
probabilistic higher-order language with continuous distributions and operators
for conditioning distributions by real-valued functions. Pleasingly, our
program logics retain the comfortable reasoning style of informal proofs thanks
to carefully selected axiomatizations of key results from probability theory.
The versatility of our logics is illustrated through the formal verification of
several intricate examples from statistics, probabilistic inference, and
machine learning. We further show the expressiveness of our logics by giving
sound embeddings of existing logics. In particular, we do this in a parametric
way by showing how the semantics idea of (unary and relational) TT-lifting can
be internalized in our logics. The soundness of PPV follows by interpreting
programs and assertions in quasi-Borel spaces (QBS), a recently proposed
variant of Borel spaces with a good structure for interpreting higher order
probabilistic programs.

spectrometer of the ESA Athena X-ray observatory. Over a field of view of 5'
equivalent diameter, it will deliver X-ray spectra from 0.2 to 12 keV with a
spectral resolution of 2.5 eV up to 7 keV on ~5 arcsecond pixels. The X-IFU is
based on a large format array of super-conducting molybdenum-gold Transition
Edge Sensors cooled at about 90 mK, each coupled with an absorber made of gold
and bismuth with a pitch of 249 microns. A cryogenic anti-coincidence detector
located underneath the prime TES array enables the non X-ray background to be
reduced. A bath temperature of about 50 mK is obtained by a series of
mechanical coolers combining 15K Pulse Tubes, 4K and 2K Joule-Thomson coolers
which pre-cool a sub Kelvin cooler made of a 3He sorption cooler coupled with
an Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator. Frequency domain multiplexing
enables to read out 40 pixels in one single channel. A photon interacting with
an absorber leads to a current pulse, amplified by the readout electronics and
whose shape is reconstructed on board to recover its energy with high accuracy.
The defocusing capability offered by the Athena movable mirror assembly enables
the X-IFU to observe the brightest X-ray sources of the sky (up to Crab-like
intensities) by spreading the telescope point spread function over hundreds of
pixels. Thus the X-IFU delivers low pile-up, high throughput (>50%), and
typically 10 eV spectral resolution at 1 Crab intensities, i.e. a factor of 10
or more better than Silicon based X-ray detectors. In this paper, the current
X-IFU baseline is presented, together with an assessment of its anticipated
performance in terms of spectral resolution, background, and count rate
capability. The X-IFU baseline configuration will be subject to a preliminary
requirement review that is scheduled at the end of 2018.

in a dynamic environment with a high level of uncertainty. In this case,
dynamic thresholds depicted by the discrete states is a very attractive way to
estimate the RUL of a dynamic machinery. Currently, there are only very few
works considering the dynamic thresholds, and these studies adopted different
algorithms to determine the discrete states and predict the continuous states
separately, which largely increases the complexity of the learning process. In
this paper, we propose a novel prognostics approach for RUL estimation of

wherein the prediction of continuous and discrete states are conducted
simultaneously and dynamically within one learning framework.

succeeded in the qualitative description of the dynamics, but they commonly
failed in providing accurate results. This is a consequence of the essential
dependance of the dynamics on elliptic functions, a fact that makes to progress
in the perturbation approach beyond the lower orders of the solution really
difficult. We propose an alternative perturbation approach that allows us to
provide a very simple low order analytical solution in trigonometric functions,

formal verification to efficiently compute the probabilities of critical

realize a shield that is applied to an RL algorithm which then optimizes the

workers refer to the elemental iron abundance (Fe/H). By contrast, when
exo-atmospheric astronomers speak of the ""metallicity"" derived from analysing
low-resolution Hubble and Spitzer spectrophotometry, they are referring to the
elemental abundances of oxygen (O/H), carbon (C/H) and nitrogen (N/H): in
decreasing order of importance, since spectra from the Hubble Wide Field Camera

cyanide and ammonia, while Spitzer photometry is sensitive to methane and
carbon monoxide. From retrieving for the water abundances, workers such as
Kreidberg et al. (2014), Wakeford et al. (2017, 2018), Arcangeli et al. (2018)
and Mansfield et al. (2018) have published figures that show the ""metallicity""
versus the masses of the exoplanets. Even if we assume that bulk and
atmospheric elemental abundances are equal, the motivation behind this research
note is to demonstrate that the conversion between the water abundance and O/H
is not straightforward. ""Water at solar metallicity"" is a temperature- and
pressure-dependent statement, because there is no single value of the water
volume mixing ratio corresponding to solar values of O/H and C/H. Overall, the
conversion factor between the water volume mixing ratio and O/H is not unity
and depends on temperature, pressure, O/H, C/H and C/O, even without invoking
disequilibrium chemistry (photochemistry and/or atmospheric mixing). It remains
unproven that disequilibrium chemistry or condensation will always return a
conversion factor of unity. It is thus a fair statement to say that the
""metallicity"" estimates inferred from atmospheric retrievals are
model-dependent.

processes where the structure is induced from finitely many pre-specified
options for a system configuration. The resulting synthesis problem is in
general a nonlinear programming problem (NLP) with integer variables. As
solving NLPs is in general not feasible, we present an alternative approach. We
present a transformation of models specified in the {PRISM} probabilistic
programming language to models that account for all possible system
configurations by means of nondeterministic choices. Together with a control
module that ensures consistent configurations throughout the system, this
transformation enables the use of optimized tools for model checking in a
black-box fashion. While this transformation increases the size of a model,
experiments with standard benchmarks show that the method provides a feasible
approach for structured synthesis. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness
along a realistic case study involving surveillance by unmanned aerial vehicles

alternative platform to interact with the customers to address their concerns.
With the abundance of such unconventional conversation resources, push for
developing effective virtual agents is more than ever. To address this
challenge, a better understanding of such customer service conversations is
required. Lately, there have been several works proposing a novel taxonomy for
fine-grained dialogue acts as well as develop algorithms for automatic
detection of these acts. The outcomes of these works are providing stepping
stones for the ultimate goal of building efficient and effective virtual
agents. But none of these works consider handling the notion of negation into
the proposed algorithms. In this work, we developed an SVM-based dialogue acts
prediction algorithm for Twitter customer service conversations where negation
handling is an integral part of the end-to-end solution. For negation handling,
we propose several efficient heuristics as well as adopt recent state-of- art
third party machine learning based solutions. Empirically we show model's

Bayesian network on spatial data. By selecting different neighborhood sizes and
structures, applying the spatial conditional independence assumption to nearest

prove the spatial Bayesian network characteristic of MCRFs, and test the

spectrum sensing over F composite fading channels. To this end, an analytical
expression for the average detection probability is firstly derived. This
expression is then extended to account for collaborative spectrum sensing,
square-law selection diversity reception and noise power uncertainty. The
corresponding receiver operating characteristics (ROC) are analyzed for
different conditions of the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), noise power
uncertainty, time-bandwidth product, multipath fading, shadowing, number of
diversity branches and number of collaborating users. It is shown that the
energy detection performance is sensitive to the severity of the multipath
fading and amount of shadowing, whereby even small variations in either of
these physical phenomena can significantly impact the detection probability. As
a figure of merit to evaluate the detection performance, the area under the ROC
curve (AUC) is derived and evaluated for different multipath fading and
shadowing conditions. Closed-form expressions for the Shannon entropy and cross
entropy are also formulated and assessed for different average SNR, multipath
fading and shadowing conditions. Then the relationship between the Shannon
entropy and ROC/AUC is examined where it is found that the average number of
bits required for encoding a signal becomes small (i.e., low Shannon entropy)
when the detection probability is high or when the AUC is large. The difference
between composite and traditional small-scale fading is emphasized by comparing
the cross entropy for Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading. A validation of the
analytical results is provided through a careful comparison with the results of
some simulations.

frames obtained in 2005 and 2006, which we discussed in a 2008 paper, we
resolve the close companion Polaris Ab from the Cepheid Polaris Aa. Because of
the small separation and large magnitude difference between Polaris Aa and Ab,
we used PSF deconvolution techniques to carry out astrometry of the binary.
Based on these new measurements, we have updated the elements for the 29.59 yr
orbit. Adopting the distance to the system from the recent Gaia Data Release 2,
we find a dynamical mass for the Cepheid of 3.45 +/- 0.75 Msun, although this
is preliminary, and will be improved by CHARA measurements covering periastron.
As is the case for the recently determined dynamical mass for the Cepheid V1334
Cyg, the mass of Polaris is significantly lower than the ""evolutionary mass""
predicted by fitting to evolutionary tracks in the HR diagram. We discuss
several questions and implications raised by these measurements, including the
pulsation mode, which instability-strip crossing the stars are in, and possible
complications such as rotation, mass loss, and binary mergers. The distant
third star in the system, Polaris B, appears to be older than the Cepheid,
based on isochrone fitting. This may indicate that the Cepheid Polaris is
relatively old and is the result of a binary merger, rather than being a young
single star.

circulation of Earth-like terrestrial planets in a variety of orbital
configurations. We relax the common assumption of the planet being
tidally-locked, and look at the role atmospheric dynamics can have in the
observed thermal phase curve when the substellar point is non-stationary. In
slowly rotating planets, a moving forcing can induce strong jets in the upper
troposphere, both prograde and retrograde, sensitive to the speed and direction
of the diurnal forcing. We find that, consistent with previous shallow water
model experiments, the thermal phase curve offset is sensitive to the velocity
of the substellar point moving across the surface of the planet. For a planet
with a known orbital period, the results show that the observed hotspot on the
planet could be either east or west of the substellar point, depending on
whether the planet is tidally-locked or not.

people involved in a conversation become more finely synchronized with each
other, and they can appear to behave almost in direct response to one another.
Studies have shown that interactional synchrony is a hallmark of relationships,
and is produced as a result of rapport. %Research has also shown that up to
two-thirds of human communication occurs via nonverbal channels such as
gestures (or body movements), facial expressions, \etc.
  In this work, we use computer vision based methods to extract nonverbal cues,
specifically from the face, and develop a model to measure interactional
synchrony based on those cues. This paper illustrates a novel method of
constructing a dynamic deep neural architecture, specifically made up of
intermediary long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), useful for learning and
predicting the extent of synchrony between two or more processes, by emulating
the nonlinear dependencies between them. On a synthetic dataset, where pairs of
sequences were generated from a Gaussian process with known covariates, the
architecture could successfully determine the covariance values of the
generating process within an error of 0.5% when tested on 100 pairs of
interacting signals. On a real-life dataset involving groups of three people,
the model successfully estimated the extent of synchrony of each group on a
scale of 1 to 5, with an overall prediction mean of $2.96%$ error when
performing 5-fold validation, as compared to 26.1% on the random permutations
serving as the control baseline.

systems. Despite their quotidian nature, it is unclear whether similar crack
patterns which span orders of magnitude in length scales share the same
underlying physics. In thin films, the characteristic length of polygonal
cracks is known to monotonically increase with the film thickness, however,
existing theories that consider the mechanical, thermodynamic, hydrodynamic,
and statistical properties of cracking often lead to contradictory predictions.
Here we experimentally investigate polygonal cracks in drying suspensions of
micron-sized particles by varying film thickness, boundary adhesion, packing
fraction, and solvent. Although polygonal cracks were observed in most systems
above a critical film thickness, in cornstarch-water mixtures, multi-scale
crack patterns were observed due to two distinct desiccation mechanisms.
Large-scale, primary polygons initially form due to capillary-induced film
shrinkage, whereas small-scale, secondary polygons appear later due to the
deswelling of the hygroscopic particles. In addition, we find that the
characteristic area of the polygonal cracks, $A_p$, obeys a universal power
law, $A_p=\alpha h^{4/3}$, where $h$ is the film thickness. By quantitatively
linking $\alpha$ with the material properties during crack formation, we
provide a robust framework for understanding multi-scale polygonal crack
patterns from microscopic to geologic scales.

domain adaptation, existing methods all require having access to real images
during training. In this paper, we introduce a drastically different way to
handle synthetic images that does not require seeing any real images at
training time. Our approach builds on the observation that foreground and
background classes are not affected in the same manner by the domain shift, and
thus should be treated differently. In particular, the former should be handled
in a detection-based manner to better account for the fact that, while their
texture in synthetic images is not photo-realistic, their shape looks natural.
Our experiments evidence the effectiveness of our approach on Cityscapes and

At some unknown time, an event occurs, and a number of nodes in the network are
affected by the event, in that they undergo a change in the statistics of their
observations. It is assumed that the event is dynamic, in that it can propagate
along the edges in the network, and affect more and more nodes with time. The
event propagation dynamics is assumed to be unknown. The goal is to design a
sequential algorithm that can detect a ""significant"" event, i.e., when the
event has affected no fewer than $\eta$ nodes, as quickly as possible, while
controlling the false alarm rate. Fully connected networks are studied first,
and the results are then extended to arbitrarily connected networks. The
designed algorithms are shown to be adaptive to the unknown propagation
dynamics, and their first-order asymptotic optimality is demonstrated as the
false alarm rate goes to zero. The algorithms can be implemented with linear
computational complexity in the network size at each time step, which is
critical for online implementation. Numerical simulations are provided to
validate the theoretical results.

recent years for the detection of radiological abnormalities in medical images

in isolation and discard previously available clinical information. In this
study we set out to explore whether Long-Short-Term-Memory networks (LSTMs) can
be used to improve classification performance when modelling the entire
sequence of radiographs that may be available for a given patient, including
their reports. A limitation of traditional LSTMs, though, is that they
implicitly assume equally-spaced observations, whereas the radiological exams
are event-based, and therefore irregularly sampled. Using both a simulated
dataset and a large-scale chest x-ray dataset, we demonstrate that a simple
modification of the LSTM architecture, which explicitly takes into account the
time lag between consecutive observations, can boost classification
performance. Our empirical results demonstrate improved detection of commonly
reported abnormalities on chest x-rays such as cardiomegaly, consolidation,
pleural effusion and hiatus hernia.

business, but also the way we perform daily activities. In fact, the past
Presidential elections in the United States as well as those in Great Britain
(Brexit) and in Colombia (peace agreement referendum) are proof that social
media play an important part in modern politics. In fact, this digital
political field is filled by political movements and political candidates
looking for popular support (number of followers), regular citizens' messages
discussing social issues (trending topics flooding social media), or even
political propaganda in favor or against politicians or political movements
(advertisement). One of the issues with social media in this era is the
presence of automatic accounts (bots) that artificially fill accounts with fake
followers, create false trending topics, and share fake news or simply flood
the net with propaganda. All this artificial information may influence people
and sometimes may even censor people's real opinions undermining their freedom
of speech. In this paper, we propose a methodology to track elections and a set
of tools used to collect and analyze election data. In particular, this paper
discusses our experiences during the Presidential Elections in Ecuador held in
2017. In fact, we show how all candidates prepared an online campaign in social
media (Twitter) and how the political campaign altered a common follower rate
subscription. We discuss that the high presence of followers during the period
between the first and second round of elections may be altered by automatic
accounts. Finally, we use bot detection systems and gathered more than 30,000
political motivated bots. In our data analysis, we show that these bots were

lines could be measured. A Si I line was also detected for the first time. We
determine a 1D Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) Fe II abundance of [Fe
II/H] = -5.99$\pm$0.25. We also investigate departures from LTE for both Fe I

metal-poor stars, we identify potential ""residual"" 3D effects in HE$~$1327-2326
arising from the absence of full 3D NLTE Fe calculations. Accordingly, we
employ measurements of 10 weak Fe I lines previously detected in an optical
spectrum of HE$~$1327-2326, as no Fe I lines are detectable in our UV spectrum.
Following our previous work, we adopt the 1D NLTE Fe I abundance of [Fe/H] =
-5.20$\pm$0.12 for HE$~$1327-2326. Adopting a value based on the optical Fe I
rather than UV lines was heavily informed by our extensive investigation of
model atmosphere and radiative transfer effects on different lines accross the
entire UV-optical wavelength range. An iron abundance of [Fe/H] =
-5.20$\pm$0.12 is only 0.2 dex higher than what was used in previous studies.

(chapter 6), or stellar collisions in dense nuclear clusters (chapter 7). In
this chapter, we discuss the probability of forming supermassive black holes

SMBHs at low and high redshift that theoretical models have to reproduce (a
more detailed account is provided in chapter 12). We further present the most
popular formation channels of SMBHs, discuss under which conditions they can
reproduce the observations, and compare various estimates in the literature on
the expected number density of SMBHs. To account for the density of quasars at
$z>6$ requires very efficient gas accretion mechanisms or high BH seeds masses.
The bottleneck to obtain sufficiently high number densities of seed BHs with
masses $>10^5$M$_\odot$ is the interplay between radiative and chemical
feedback, which constrains the conditions for primordial, isothermal gas
collapse.

topics and the average voter competence may not be high enough for some topics.
Representative democracy, where voters choose representatives to vote, can be
an elixir in both these situations. Representative democracy is a specific way

Our main result states that under general and natural conditions,
  1. Representative democracy can make the correct decisions simultaneously for
multiple noisy issues.
  2. When the cost of voting is fixed, the optimal representative democracy
requires that representatives are elected from constant sized groups: the
number of representatives should be linear in the number of voters.
  3. When the cost and benefit of voting are both polynomial, the optimal group
size is close to linear in the number of voters. This work sets the
mathematical foundation for studying the quality-quantity tradeoff in a

coefficients and time-dependent scattering damping in $\mathbf{R}^n$, where
$n\geq 2$. It is expected that the critical exponent will be Strauss' number
$p_0(n)$, which is also the one for semilinear wave equations without damping
terms. Lai and Takamura (2018) have obtained the blow-up part, together with
the upper bound of lifespan, in the sub-critical case $p<p_0(n)$. In this
paper, we extend their results to the critical case $p=p_0(n)$. The proof is
based on Wakasa and Yordanov (2018), which concerns the blow-up and upper bound
of lifespan for critical semilinear wave equations with variable coefficients.

following access to a distribution: it submits a query set $S$ to an oracle,
which returns a sample from the distribution conditioned on being from $S$. In
the non-adaptive setting, all query sets must be specified in advance of
viewing the outcomes.
  Our main result is the first polylogarithmic-query algorithm for equivalence
testing, deciding whether two unknown distributions are equal to or far from
each other. This is an exponential improvement over the previous best upper
bound, and demonstrates that the complexity of the problem in this model is
intermediate to the the complexity of the problem in the standard sampling
model and the adaptive conditional sampling model. We also significantly
improve the sample complexity for the easier problems of uniformity and
identity testing. For the former, our algorithm requires only $\tilde O(\log
n)$ queries, matching the information-theoretic lower bound up to a $O(\log
\log n)$-factor.
  Our algorithm works by reducing the problem from $\ell_1$-testing to
$\ell_\infty$-testing, which enjoys a much cheaper sample complexity.
Necessitated by the limited power of the non-adaptive model, our algorithm is
very simple to state. However, there are significant challenges in the
analysis, due to the complex structure of how two arbitrary distributions may
differ.

and corresponding measurements or observations, Bayesian filtering provides a
principled statistical framework for inferring the posterior distribution of
the current state given all measurements up to the present time. For example,
the Apollo lunar module implemented a Kalman filter to infer its location from
a sequence of earth-based radar measurements and land safely on the moon.
  To perform Bayesian filtering, we require a measurement model that describes
the conditional distribution of each observation given state. The Kalman filter
takes this measurement model to be linear, Gaussian. Here we show how a
nonlinear, Gaussian approximation to the distribution of state given
observation can be used in conjunction with Bayes' rule to build a nonlinear,
non-Gaussian measurement model. The resulting approach, called the
Discriminative Kalman Filter (DKF), retains fast closed-form updates for the
posterior. We argue there are many cases where the distribution of state given
measurement is better-approximated as Gaussian, especially when the
dimensionality of measurements far exceeds that of states and the Bernstein-von
Mises theorem applies. Online neural decoding for brain-computer interfaces
provides a motivating example, where filtering incorporates increasingly
detailed measurements of neural activity to provide users control over external
devices. Within the BrainGate2 clinical trial, the DKF successfully enabled
three volunteers with quadriplegia to control an on-screen cursor in real-time
using mental imagery alone. Participant ""T9"" used the DKF to type out messages
on a tablet PC.

orbital energy dependent regularizers, $\kappa$ and $\sigma$, in conjunction
with orbital-optimized MP2 (OOMP2). The resulting fifth-order scaling methods,
$\kappa$-OOMP2 and $\sigma$-OOMP2, have been examined for bond-breaking,
thermochemistry, and biradical problems. Both methods with strong enough
regularization restore restricted to unrestricted instability (i.e.
Coulson-Fischer points) that unregularized OOMP2 lacks when breaking bonds in
$\text{H}_{2}$, $\text{C}_2\text{H}_6$, $\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$, and
$\text{C}_2\text{H}_2$. The training of the $\kappa$ and $\sigma$
regularization parameters was performed with the W4-11 set. We further
developed scaled correlation energy variants, $\kappa$-S-OOMP2 and
$\sigma$-S-OOMP2, by training on the TAE140 subset of the W4-11 set. Those new
OOMP2 methods were tested on the RSE43 set and the TA14 set where unmodified
OOMP2 itself performs very well. The modifications we made were found
insignificant in these data sets. Furthermore, we tested the new OOMP2 methods
on singlet biradicaloids using Yamaguchi's approximate spin-projection. Unlike
the unregularized OOMP2, which fails to converge these systems due to the
singularity, we show that regularized OOMP2 methods successfully capture strong
biradicaloid characters. While further assessment on larger datasets is
desirable, $\kappa$-OOMP2 with $\kappa$ = 1.45 $E_{h}^{-1}$ appears to combine
favorable recovery of Coulson-Fischer points with good numerical performance.

ability to image large neural populations with single-cell resolution. The
resulting datasets are quite large, which has presented a barrier to routine
open sharing of this data, slowing progress in reproducible research. State of
the art methods for analyzing this data are based on non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF); these approaches solve a non-convex optimization problem,
and are effective when good initializations are available, but can break down
in low-SNR settings where common initialization approaches fail. Here we
introduce an approach to compressing and denoising functional imaging data. The
method is based on a spatially-localized penalized matrix decomposition (PMD)
of the data to separate (low-dimensional) signal from (temporally-uncorrelated)
noise. This approach can be applied in parallel on local spatial patches and is
therefore highly scalable, does not impose non-negativity constraints or
require stringent identifiability assumptions (leading to significantly more
robust results compared to NMF), and estimates all parameters directly from the
data, so no hand-tuning is required. We have applied the method to a wide range
of functional imaging data (including one-photon, two-photon, three-photon,
widefield, somatic, axonal, dendritic, calcium, and voltage imaging datasets):
in all cases, we observe ~2-4x increases in SNR and compression rates of
20-300x with minimal visible loss of signal, with no adjustment of
hyperparameters; this in turn facilitates the process of demixing the observed
activity into contributions from individual neurons. We focus on two
challenging applications: dendritic calcium imaging data and voltage imaging
data in the context of optogenetic stimulation. In both cases, we show that our
new approach leads to faster and much more robust extraction of activity from
the data.

the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009.
It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August
2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine
frequency bands from 30 to 857GHz. This paper presents the cosmological legacy
of Planck, which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters
of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on
deviations from that model. The 6-parameter LCDM model continues to provide an
excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift,
describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just
six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power
spectra constrained well, Planck measures five of the six parameters to better
than 1% (simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter (theta_*) now
known to 0.03%. We describe the multi-component sky as seen by Planck, the
success of the LCDM model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of
structure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes
introduced in this 2018 release. The Planck data, alone and in combination with
other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe
and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and
evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the Planck mission, and highlight
areas ripe for further experimental advances.

procedures for the Planck 2018 release. Major improvements in mapmaking have
been achieved since the previous 2015 release. They enabled the first
significant measurement of the reionization optical depth parameter using HFI
data. This paper presents an extensive analysis of systematic effects,
including the use of simulations to facilitate their removal and characterize
the residuals. The polarized data, which presented a number of known problems
in the 2015 Planck release, are very significantly improved. Calibration, based
on the CMB dipole, is now extremely accurate and in the frequency range 100 to
353 GHz reduces intensity-to-polarization leakage caused by calibration
mismatch. The Solar dipole direction has been determined in the three lowest
HFI frequency channels to within one arc minute, and its amplitude has an
absolute uncertainty smaller than $0.35\mu$K, an accuracy of order $10^{-4}$.
This is a major legacy from the HFI for future CMB experiments. The removal of
bandpass leakage has been improved by extracting the bandpass-mismatch
coefficients for each detector as part of the mapmaking process; these values
in turn improve the intensity maps. This is a major change in the philosophy of
""frequency maps"", which are now computed from single detector data, all
adjusted to the same average bandpass response for the main foregrounds.
Simulations reproduce very well the relative gain calibration of detectors, as
well as drifts within a frequency induced by the residuals of the main
systematic effect. Using these simulations, we measure and correct the small
frequency calibration bias induced by this systematic effect at the $10^{-4}$
level. There is no detectable sign of a residual calibration bias between the
first and second acoustic peaks in the CMB channels, at the $10^{-3}$ level.

polarized synchrotron and thermal dust emission, derived from the third set of
Planck frequency maps. These products have significantly lower contamination
from instrumental systematic effects than previous versions. The methodologies
used to derive these maps follow those described in earlier papers, adopting
four methods (Commander, NILC, SEVEM, and SMICA) to extract the CMB component,
as well as three methods (Commander, GNILC, and SMICA) to extract astrophysical
components. Our revised CMB temperature maps agree with corresponding products
in the Planck 2015 delivery, whereas the polarization maps exhibit
significantly lower large-scale power, reflecting the improved data processing
described in companion papers; however, the noise properties of the resulting
data products are complicated, and the best available end-to-end simulations
exhibit relative biases with respect to the data at the few percent level.
Using these maps, we are for the first time able to fit the spectral index of
thermal dust independently over 3 degree regions. We derive a conservative
estimate of the mean spectral index of polarized thermal dust emission of
beta_d = 1.55 +/- 0.05, where the uncertainty marginalizes both over all known
systematic uncertainties and different estimation techniques. For polarized
synchrotron emission, we find a mean spectral index of beta_s = -3.1 +/- 0.1,
consistent with previously reported measurements. We note that the current data
processing does not allow for construction of unbiased single-bolometer maps,
and this limits our ability to extract CO emission and correlated components.
The foreground results for intensity derived in this paper therefore do not
supersede corresponding Planck 2015 products. For polarization the new results
supersede the corresponding 2015 products in all respects.

measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the
standard spatially-flat 6-parameter $\Lambda$CDM cosmology having a power-law
spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted ""base $\Lambda$CDM"" in this
paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in
combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density $\Omega_c h^2 =
0.120\pm 0.001$, baryon density $\Omega_b h^2 = 0.0224\pm 0.0001$, scalar
spectral index $n_s = 0.965\pm 0.004$, and optical depth $\tau = 0.054\pm
0.007$ (in this abstract we quote $68\,\%$ confidence regions on measured
parameters and $95\,\%$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is
measured to $0.03\,\%$ precision, with $100\theta_*=1.0411\pm 0.0003$. These
results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable,
with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions.
Assuming the base-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters
are: Hubble constant $H_0 = (67.4\pm 0.5)$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter
$\Omega_m = 0.315\pm 0.007$; and matter fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 =
0.811\pm 0.006$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the
base-$\Lambda$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra
relativistic degrees of freedom to be $N_{\rm eff} = 2.99\pm 0.17$, and the
neutrino mass is tightly constrained to $\sum m_\nu< 0.12$eV. The CMB spectra
continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base
-$\Lambda$CDM at over $2\,\sigma$, which pulls some parameters that affect the
lensing amplitude away from the base-$\Lambda$CDM model; however, this is not
supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the
background geometry) BAO data. (Abridged)

potential using the final $\textit{Planck}$ 2018 temperature and polarization

lensing is detected at $40\,\sigma$. We present an extensive set of tests of
the robustness of the lensing-potential power spectrum, and construct a

the $\textit{Planck}$ CMB power spectra within the $\rm{\Lambda CDM}$ model.
Combined with baryon density and other weak priors, the lensing analysis alone
constrains $\sigma_8 \Omega_{\rm m}^{0.25}=0.589\pm 0.020$ ($1\,\sigma$

tight individual parameter constraints, $\sigma_8=0.811\pm0.019$,

from the Dark Energy Survey, and give combined lensing-only parameter
constraints that are tighter than joint results using galaxy clustering. Using
$\textit{Planck}$ cosmic infrared background (CIB) maps we make a combined
estimate of the lensing potential over $60\,\%$ of the sky with considerably
more small-scale signal. We demonstrate delensing of the $\textit{Planck}$

Planck CMB anisotropy measurements. The results are fully consistent with the
two previous Planck cosmological releases, but have smaller uncertainties
thanks to improvements in the characterization of polarization at low and high
multipoles. Planck temperature, polarization, and lensing data determine the
spectral index of scalar perturbations to be $n_\mathrm{s}=0.9649\pm 0.0042$ at
68% CL and show no evidence for a scale dependence of $n_\mathrm{s}.$ Spatial
flatness is confirmed at a precision of 0.4% at 95% CL with the combination
with BAO data. The Planck 95% CL upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio,
$r_{0.002}<0.10$, is further tightened by combining with the BICEP2/Keck Array
BK15 data to obtain $r_{0.002}<0.056$. In the framework of single-field
inflationary models with Einstein gravity, these results imply that: (a)
slow-roll models with a concave potential, $V"" (\phi) < 0,$ are increasingly
favoured by the data; and (b) two different methods for reconstructing the
inflaton potential find no evidence for dynamics beyond slow roll.
Non-parametric reconstructions of the primordial power spectrum consistently
confirm a pure power law. A complementary analysis also finds no evidence for
theoretically motivated parameterized features in the Planck power spectrum, a
result further strengthened for certain oscillatory models by a new combined
analysis that includes Planck bispectrum data. The new Planck polarization data
provide a stringent test of the adiabaticity of the initial conditions. The
polarization data also provide improved constraints on inflationary models that
predict a small statistically anisotropic quadrupolar modulation of the
primordial fluctuations. However, the polarization data do not confirm physical
models for a scale-dependent dipolar modulation.

$\psi$, and dispersion of angles $S$ of Galactic dust thermal emission produced
from the 2018 release of Planck data. We confirm that the mean and maximum of
$p$ decrease with increasing $N_H$. The uncertainty on the maximum polarization
fraction, $p_\mathrm{max}=22.0$% at 80 arcmin resolution, is dominated by the
uncertainty on the zero level in total intensity. The observed inverse
behaviour between $p$ and $S$ is interpreted with models of the polarized sky
that include effects from only the topology of the turbulent Galactic magnetic
field. Thus, the statistical properties of $p$, $\psi$, and $S$ mostly reflect
the structure of the magnetic field. Nevertheless, we search for potential
signatures of varying grain alignment and dust properties. First, we analyse
the product map $S \times p$, looking for residual trends. While $p$ decreases
by a factor of 3--4 between $N_H=10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $N_H=2\times 10^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$, $S \times p$ decreases by only about 25%, a systematic trend
observed in both the diffuse ISM and molecular clouds. Second, we find no
systematic trend of $S \times p$ with the dust temperature, even though in the
diffuse ISM lines of sight with high $p$ and low $S$ tend to have colder dust.
We also compare Planck data with starlight polarization in the visible at high
latitudes. The agreement in polarization angles is remarkable. Two polarization
emission-to-extinction ratios that characterize dust optical properties depend
only weakly on $N_H$ and converge towards the values previously determined for
translucent lines of sight. We determine an upper limit for the polarization
fraction in extinction of 13%, compatible with the $p_\mathrm{max}$ observed in
emission. These results provide strong constraints for models of Galactic dust
in diffuse gas.

Sc5Ru6Sn18 crystallizes in a tetragonal structure (space group I41/acd) with
the lattice parameters a = 1.387(3) nm and c = 2.641(5) nm. Both DC and AC

critical field, H_c2 (0) = 26(1) kOe. The zero-field electronic specific-heat
data are well fitted using a single-gap BCS model, with superconducting gap =
0.64(1) meV. The Sommerfeld constant varies linearly with the applied magnetic
field, indicating s-wave superconductivity in Sc5Ru6Sn18. Specific-heat and
transverse-field (TF) muSR measurements reveal that Sc5Ru6Sn18 is a
superconductor with strong electron-phonon coupling, with TF-muSR also
suggesting the single-gap s-wave character of the superconductivity.
Furthermore, zero-field muSR measurements do not detect spontaneous magnetic
fields below Tc, hence implying that time-reversal symmetry is preserved in
Sc5Ru6Sn18.

features that causally affect the outcome. This is often impossible to do from
purely observational data, and a natural relaxation is to identify features
that are correlated with the outcome even conditioned on all other observed
features. For example, we want to identify that smoking really is correlated
with cancer conditioned on demographics. The knockoff procedure is a recent
breakthrough in statistics that, in theory, can identify truly correlated
features while guaranteeing that the false discovery is limited. The idea is to
create synthetic data -- knockoffs -- that captures correlations amongst the
features. However there are substantial computational and practical challenges
to generating and using knockoffs. This paper makes several key advances that
enable knockoff application to be more efficient and powerful. We develop an
efficient algorithm to generate valid knockoffs from Bayesian Networks. Then we
systematically evaluate knockoff test statistics and develop new statistics
with improved power. The paper combines new mathematical guarantees with
systematic experiments on real and synthetic data.

regularization term plays an important role. The regularization term learned
via generative approaches is easy to transfer to various image restoration, but
offers inferior restoration quality compared with that learned via
discriminative approaches. On the contrary, the regularization term learned via
discriminative approaches are usually trained for a specific image restoration
problem, and fail in the problem for which it is not trained. To address this
issue, we propose a generic diffusion process (genericDP) to handle multiple
Gaussian denoising problems based on the Trainable Non-linear Reaction
Diffusion (TNRD) models. Instead of one model, which consists of a diffusion
and a reaction term, for one Gaussian denoising problem in TNRD, we enforce
multiple TNRD models to share one diffusion term. The trained genericDP model
can provide both promising denoising performance and high training efficiency
compared with the original TNRD models. We also transfer the trained diffusion
term to non-blind deconvolution which is unseen in the training phase.
Experiment results show that the trained diffusion term for multiple Gaussian
denoising can be transferred to image non-blind deconvolution as an image prior
and provide competitive performance.

d-orbital states in transition metal dichalcogenides, implying superior
transport performance of antimonene. The Young's and shear moduli of
beta-antimonene are observed to be ~25% higher than those of bulk antimony,
while the hexagonal lattice constant of the monolayer reduces significantly
(~5%) from that in bulk, indicative of strong inter-layer coupling. The ideal
tensile test of beta-antimonene under applied uniaxial strain highlights ideal
strengths of 6 GPa and 8 GPa, corresponding to critical strains of 15% and 17%
in the zigzag and armchair directions, respectively. During the deformation
process, the structural integrity of the material is shown to be better
preserved, albeit moderately, in the armchair direction. Interestingly, the
application of uniaxial strain in the zigzag and armchair directions unveil
direction-dependent trends in the electronic band structure. We find that the
nature of the band gap remains insensitive to strain in the zigzag direction,
while strain in the armchair direction activates an indirect-direct band gap
transition at a critical strain of 4%, owing to a band switching mechanism. The
curvature of the conduction band minimum increases during the transition, which
suggests a lighter effective mass of electrons in the direct-gap configuration
than in the free-standing state of equilibrium. The work function of
free-standing beta-antimonene is 4.59 eV and it attains a maximum value of 5.07
eV under an applied biaxial strain of 4%.

up-stream (lower longitude) side of the star-forming complex W43 (G30.8-0.03),
and composes a molecular bow shock (MBS) concave to W43, exhibiting an
arc-shaped molecular ridge perpendicular to the galactic plane with width $\sim
0^\circ.1$ (10 pc) and vertical length $\sim 1^\circ \ (100\ {\rm pc})$. The
MBS is coincident with the radio continuum bow of thermal origin, indicating
association of ionized gas and similarity to a cometary bright-rimmed cloud.
The up-stream edge of the bow is sharp with a growth width of $\sim 0.5$ pc
indicative of shock front property. The velocity width is $\sim 10$ km/s, and
the center velocity decreases by $\sim 15$ \kms from bottom to top of the bow.
The total mass of molecular gas in MBS is estimated to be $\sim 1.2\times 10^6

thickness increases step like at the MBS by $\sim 2$ times from lower to upper
longitude, which indicates hydraulic-jump in the gaseous disk. We argue that
the MBS was formed by the galactic shock compression of an accelerated flow in
the spiral-arm potential encountering the W43 molecular complex. A bow-shock
theory can well reproduce the bow morphology. We argue that molecular bows are
common in galactic shock waves not only in the Galaxy but also in galaxies,
where MBS are associated with giant cometary HII regions. We also analyzed the

accretion onto black holes occurring at rates exceeding the Eddington limit.
Our focus is on the applications to the growth of black hole seeds at high
redshift. We first present the general notion of Super-Eddington accretion, and
then summarize the different models and numerical simulations developed to
study such regime. We consider optically thick flows in accretion disks as well
as in spherically symmetric envelopes, and devote particular attention to the
widely adopted model based on the SLIM disk solution. While attractive for its
simplicity, the SLIM disk solution is challenged by the latest generation of
three-dimensional radiation (magneto)-hydrodynamical simulations, in which
radiative losses can be an order of magnitude higher, and the mechanisms of
radiation transport is more complex than straight advection as it takes place
in a complex turbulent regime. We then discuss the gas supply rate to the
sub-pc scale accretion disk or envelope from larger scales, revisiting gas
inflow rates in protogalaxies under various conditions. We conclude that in the
dense gaseous nuclei of high-z galaxies the conditions necessary for the onset
of Super Eddington accretion regimes, such as a high optical depth and high gas
supply rates from large scales, should be naturally met. Feedback from the
growing BH seed should not alter significantly such conditions according to the
results of radiation magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of super-critical flows
in accretion disks. Furthermore, based on the required nuclear gas inflow rates
and the tendency of stellar feedback to remove efficiently gas in low mass
halos, we argue that super-critical accretion will be more easily achieved in
relatively sizable halos, with virial masses $M_{\rm vir} > 10^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$, which become more common at $z < 15$.

Thanks to the use of masks of random sizes during training, the neural networks
of PNNS well adapt to the available context that may vary, depending on the

contrast, the Universe today is highly structured on a vast range of length and
mass scales. In the evolution towards increasing complexity, the formation of
the first stars marks a primary transition event. The first generation of
stars, the so-called Population III (or Pop. III) build up from truly
metal-free primordial gas. They have long been thought to live short, solitary
lives, with only one massive star forming per halo. However, in recent years
this simple picture has undergone substantial revision, and we now understand
that stellar birth in the early Universe is subject to the same complexity as
star formation at present days. In this chapter, I review the current state of
the field. I begin by introducing the basics concepts of star-formation theory
and by discussing the typical environment in which Pop. III stars are thought
to form. Then I argue that the accretion disk that builds up in the center of a
halo is likely to fragment, resulting in the formation of a cluster of stars
with a wide range of masses, and I speculate about how this process may be
influenced by stellar feedback, the presence of magnetic fields, the energy
input from dark matter annihilation, and the occurrence of large- scale
streaming velocities between baryons and dark matter. Finally, I discuss direct
and indirect constraints on Pop. III star formation from high-redshift
observations and from the search for extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky

it leads to improvements that go past known barriers in two algorithmic
settings of large-scale graph processing: Massively Parallel Computation (MPC),
and Local Computation Algorithms (LCA).
  - MPC with Strongly Sublinear Memory: Recently, there has been growing
interest in obtaining MPC algorithms that are faster than their classic $O(\log
n)$-round parallel counterparts for problems such as MIS, Maximal Matching,
2-Approximation of Minimum Vertex Cover, and $(1+\epsilon)$-Approximation of
Maximum Matching. Currently, all such MPC algorithms require
$\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ memory per machine. Czumaj et al. [STOC'18] were the first
to handle $\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ memory, running in $O((\log\log n)^2)$ rounds. We
obtain $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log \Delta})$-round MPC algorithms for all these four
problems that work even when each machine has memory $n^{\alpha}$ for any
constant $\alpha\in (0, 1)$. Here, $\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree. These
are the first sublogarithmic-time algorithms for these problems that break the
linear memory barrier.
  - LCAs with Query Complexity Below the Parnas-Ron Paradigm: Currently, the
best known LCA for MIS has query complexity $\Delta^{O(\log \Delta)} poly(\log
n)$, by Ghaffari [SODA'16]. As pointed out by Rubinfeld, obtaining a query
complexity of $poly(\Delta\log n)$ remains a central open question. Ghaffari's
bound almost reaches a $\Delta^{\Omega\left(\frac{\log \Delta}{\log\log
\Delta}\right)}$ barrier common to all known MIS LCAs, which simulate
distributed algorithms by learning the local topology, \`{a} la Parnas-Ron
[TCS'07]. This barrier follows from the $\Omega(\frac{\log \Delta}{\log\log
\Delta})$ distributed lower bound of Kuhn, et al. [JACM'16]. We break this
barrier and obtain an MIS LCA with query complexity $\Delta^{O(\log\log
\Delta)} poly(\log n)$.

spinning up since 2003, as already reported. The spin up/down rate and the
3$-$12 keV flux, determined every 250 d, showed a clear negative correlation,
which can be successfully explained by the accretion torque model proposed by
Ghosh & Lamb (1979). When the mass, radius and distance of the neutron star are
allowed to vary over a range of 1.0$-$2.4 solar masses, 9.5$-$15 km, and
0.77$-$0.85 kpc, respectively, the magnetic field strength of $B=(4-25)

observed results cannot be explained by the values of $B\sim10^{12}\ \rm G$
previously suggested for X Persei, as long as the mass, radius, and distance
are required to take reasonable values. Assuming a distance of $0.81\pm0.04$
kpc as indicated by optical astrometry, the mass of the neutron star is
estimated as $M=2.03\pm0.17$ solar masses.

induce a novel degenerate cutoff-state near which the beyond-cutoff radiation
in one side can be switched to that in the other side by a minor variation of
the magnetic field from the bias. The magnetization bias needed for the
degeneracy is in proportion to the metal film thickness and in inverse
proportion to the wavelength.

of a Boolean function and the approximate rank of a Boolean matrix, using
quantum arguments. We prove these lower bounds using a quantum query algorithm
for the combinatorial group testing problem.
  We show that for any function f, the approximate degree of computing the OR
of n copies of f is Omega(sqrt{n}) times the approximate degree of f, which is
optimal. No such general result was known prior to our work, and even the lower
bound for the OR of ANDs function was only resolved in 2013.
  We then prove an analogous result in communication complexity, showing that
the logarithm of the approximate rank (or more precisely, the approximate
gamma_2 norm) of F: X x Y -> {0,1} grows by a factor of Omega~(sqrt{n}) when we
take the OR of n copies of F, which is also essentially optimal. As a
corollary, we give a new proof of Razborov's celebrated Omega(sqrt{n}) lower
bound on the quantum communication complexity of the disjointness problem.
  Finally, we generalize both these results from composition with the OR
function to composition with arbitrary symmetric functions, yielding nearly
optimal lower bounds in this setting as well.

whose solution contains the solution of the homogenized equation which
describes the macroscopic behaviour, and the corrector which encodes the
microscopic behaviour. We approximate the posterior probability by a
probability measure determined by the solution of the two scale homogenized
equation. We show that the Hellinger distance of these measures converges to
zero when the microscale converges to zero, and establish an explicit
convergence rate when the solution of the two scale homogenized equation is
sufficiently regular. Sampling the posterior measure by Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) method, instead of solving the two scale equation using fine mesh
for each proposal with extremely high cost, we can solve the macroscopic two
scale homogenized equation. Although this equation is posed in a high
dimensional tensorized domain, it can be solved with essentially optimal
complexity by the sparse tensor product finite element method, which reduces
the computational complexity of the MCMC sampling method substantially. We show
numerically that observations on the macrosopic behaviour alone are not
sufficient to infer the microstructure. We need also observations on the
corrector. Solving the two scale homogenized equation, we get both the solution
to the homogenized equation and the corrector. Thus our method is particularly
suitable for sampling the posterior measure of two scale coefficients.

to investigate the abundance anomalies of these elements in terms of mutual
correlation, dependence upon stellar parameters, and difference between normal
and CP stars. We found that CNO are generally underabundant (relative to the
standard star Procyon) typically by several tenths dex to ~1dex for almost all
stars (regardless of CP or normal), though those classified as peculiar (Am or
HgMn) tend to show larger underabundance, especially for C in late Am stars and
for N in HgMn stars of late B-type, for which deficiency amounts even up to
~2dex. While the behaviors of these three elements are qualitatively similar to
each other, the quantitative extent of peculiarity (or the vulnerability to the
physical process causing anomaly) tends to follow the inequality relation of
C>N>O. Regarding the considerable star-to-star dispersion observed at any Teff,
the most important cause is presumably the difference in rotational velocity.

our work focuses on obstacle avoidance based on a lightweight stereo camera

locate obstacles and to automatically steer the UAV around them. For disparity
map computation we optimize the well-known semi-global matching (SGM) approach

$d$-partite Independent Set query oracle (GPIS) and it was introduced by Bishnu
et al. (ISAAC'18). GPIS is a generalization to hypergraphs of the Bipartite
Independent Set query oracle (BIS) introduced by Beame et al. (ITCS'18 and
TALG'20) for estimating the number of edges in graphs. Formally, GPIS is
defined as follows: GPIS oracle for a $d$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$
takes as input $d$ pairwise disjoint non-empty subsets $A_1, \ldots, A_d$ of
vertices in $\cal H$ and answers whether there is a hyperedge in $\mathcal{H}$
that intersects each set $A_i$, where $i \in \{1, \, 2, \, \ldots, d\}$. } For
$d=2$, the GPIS oracle is nothing but BIS oracle.

Research into tensegrity structures has resulted in reliable techniques for
their form finding and analysis. However, most techniques address topology and
form separately. This paper presents a bio-inspired approach for the combined
topology identification and form finding of planar tensegrity structures.
Tensegrity structures are generated using tensegrity cells (elementary stable
self-stressed units that have been proven to compose any tensegrity structure)
according to two multiplication mechanisms: cellular adhesion and fusion.
Changes in the dimension of the self-stress space of the structure are found to
depend on the number of adhesion and fusion steps conducted as well as on the
interaction among the cells composing the system. A methodology for defining a
basis of the self-stress space is also provided. Through the definition of the
equilibrium shape, the number of nodes and members as well as the number of
self-stress states, the cellular multiplication method can integrate design
considerations, providing great flexibility and control over the tensegrity
structure designed and opening the door to the development of a whole new realm
of planar tensegrity systems with controllable characteristics.

anytime problems. However, it depends on a numeric feedback signal, which can
be difficult to define. Real-time MCTS is a variant which may only rarely
encounter states with an explicit, extrinsic reward. To deal with such cases,
the experimenter has to supply an additional numeric feedback signal in the
form of a heuristic, which intrinsically guides the agent. Recent work has
shown evidence that in different areas the underlying structure is ordinal and
not numerical. Hence erroneous and biased heuristics are inevitable, especially
in such domains. In this paper, we propose a MCTS variant which only depends on
qualitative feedback, and therefore opens up new applications for MCTS. We also
find indications that translating absolute into ordinal feedback may be
beneficial. Using a puzzle domain, we show that our preference-based MCTS
variant, wich only receives qualitative feedback, is able to reach a
performance level comparable to a regular MCTS baseline, which obtains
quantitative feedback.

based on the density functional theory and linearized Boltzmann equation with
the single-mode relaxation-time approximation. It is found that both materials
exhibit very low and anisotropic intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity.
Despite of the very low mass density and simple crystal structure of
Na$_2$MgSn, its lattice thermal conductivities along $a$ and $c$ axes are only
1.75 and 0.80 W/m$\cdot$K respectively at room temperatures. When Sn is
replaced by the heavier element Pb, its lattice thermal conductivities decrease
remarkably to 0.51 and 0.31 W/m$\cdot$K respectively along $a$ and $c$ axes at
room temperatures. We show that the low lattice thermal conductivities of both
materials are mainly due to their very short phonon lifetimes, which are
roughly between 0.4 to 4.5 ps. Combined with previous experimental
measurements, the metallic Na$_2$MgPb can not be a good thermoelectric

processes, e.g. star formation efficiency, time-scale of infall and outflow
loading factor We aim to trace log(N/O) versus [Fe/H] in the Milky Way and to
compare it with a set of chemical evolution models to understand the role of
infall, outflow and star formation efficiency in the building-up of the
Galactic disc. We use the abundances from idr2-3, idr4, idr5 data releases of
the Gaia-ESO Survey both for Galactic field and open cluster stars.We determine
membership and average composition of open clusters and we separate thin and
thick disc field stars.We consider the effect of mixing in the abundance of N
in giant stars. We compute a grid of chemical evolution models, suited to
reproduce the main features of our Galaxy, exploring the effects of the star
formation efficiency, the infall time-scale and the differential outflow. With
our samples, we map the metallicity range -0.6<[Fe/H]<0.3 with a corresponding
-1.2<log(N/O)<-0.2, where the secondary production of N dominates. Thanks to
the wide range of Galactocentric distances covered by our samples, we can
distinguish the behaviour of log(N/O) in different parts of the Galaxy. Our
spatially resolved results allow us to distinguish differences in the evolution
of N/O with Galactocentric radius. Comparing the data with our models, we can
characterise the radial regions of our Galaxy. A shorter infall time-scale is
needed in the inner regions, while the outer regions need a longer infall
time-scale, coupled with a higher star formation efficiency. We compare our
results with nebular abundances obtained in MaNGA galaxies, finding in our
Galaxy a much wider range of log(N/O) than in integrated observations of
external galaxies of similar stellar mass, but similar to the ranges found in
studies of individual H ii regions.

hole solutions, resulting from the minimal coupling of general nonlinear
electrodynamics to General Relativity. This analysis deals with static
spherically symmetric (elementary) configurations with spherical horizons. Our
methods are based on the study of the behaviour (in vacuum and on the boundary
of their domain of definition) of the Lagrangian density functions
characterizing the nonlinear electrodynamic models in flat spacetime. These
functions are constrained by some admissibility conditions endorsing the
physical consistency of the corresponding theories, which are classified in
several families, some of them supporting elementary solutions in flat space
which are non topological solitons. This classification induces a similar one
for the elementary black hole solutions of the associated gravitating nonlinear
electrodynamics, whose geometrical structures are thoroughly explored. A
consistent thermodynamic analysis can be developed for the subclass of families
whose associated black hole solutions behave asymptotically as the
Schwarzschild metric (in absence of a cosmological term). In these cases we
obtain the behaviour of the main thermodynamic functions, as well as important
finite relations among them. In particular, we find the general equation
determining the set of extreme black holes for every model, and a general Smarr
formula, valid for the set of elementary black hole solutions of such models.
We also consider the one-parameter group of scale transformations, which are
symmetries of the field equations of any nonlinear electrodynamics in flat
spacetime.

on the case of finite-dimensional glass-forming systems, in particular

that allows us to account, at least in part, for the effect of these

in terms of a random-field + random-bond Ising model with additional, power-law
decaying, pair and multi-body interactions generated by the point-to-set

check the robustness of the approximation scheme by applying it to a fully

implications of this mapping for glass-forming liquids and the possibility it
offers to determine the presence or not of a finite-temperature thermodynamic

study is mostly conducted in single party settings. In this paper, we
generalize important results in multipartite entanglement theory to their
counterparts in quantum coherence theory. First, we give a necessary and
sufficient condition for when two pure multipartite states are equivalent under
local quantum incoherent operations and classical communication (LICC), i.e.,
two states can be deterministically transformed to each other under LICC
operations. Next, we investigate and give the conditions in which such a
transformation succeeds only stochastically. Different from entanglement case
for two-qubit states, we find that the SLICC equivalence classes are infinite.
Moreover, it's possible that there are some classes of states in multipartite
entanglement can convert into each other, while, they cannot convert into each
other in multipartite coherence. In order to show the difference among SLICC
classes, we introduce two coherence monotones: accessible coherence and source
coherence, following the logistics given in [\emph{Phys.~Rev.~Lett. 115,~150502
(2015)}]. These coherence monotones have a straightforward operational
interpretation, namely, the accessible coherence characterizes the proficiency
of a state to generate other states via quantum incoherent operations, while
the source coherence characterizes the set of states that can be reached via
quantum incoherent operations acting on the given state of interest.

We find a surprisingly large interval of alloy composition, $0.3<x<0.6$, in

also obtained for transitions driven by hydrostatic pressure. Analysis of the

sequence but significantly different topology and $\alpha$-helix and
$\beta$-sheet contents. We find that for both CBP-BD and apoPC, the energetic
component dominates in methanol, ethanol, and cyclohexane, with the most stable
structures in these solvents sharing the same characteristics described as an
association of a-helices. In water, the entropic component is as strong as or
even stronger than the energetic one, with a large gain of translational,
configurational entropy of water becoming crucially important, so that the
relative contents of $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$-sheet and the content of total
secondary structures are carefully selected to achieve sufficiently close
packing of side chains. Our analysis, which requires minimal computational
effort, can be applied to any protein immersed in any solvent and provides
robust predictions that are quite consistent with the experimental observations
for proteins in different solvent environments, thus paving the way toward a
more detailed understanding of the folding process.

paper we introduce the novel Holographic Orbital Return Storage Technology

is a payload module which stores hundreds of terabytes of data on a robust 5D
holographic disk. After the end of mission (EOM), the module is detached from
the satellite and lowered into the Earth's atmosphere, protected by a
heatshield surface and a parachute. The recovery of the module allows the
readout of big sensor data on Earth. Besides fulfilling the big demand for
applications of this technology nowadays, this paper discusses several major
use-cases for near-future concepts and missions. HORST will enable many
possibilities for new science missions and business in space. Since there is no
comparable alternative technology, the lack of competition and the increasing

we find that the mean diffusion exponent for the whole phase space is either
$\mu=1$, denoting normal diffusion or $\mu=2$ denoting anomalous diffusion (and
ballistic motion). The mean diffusion of the whole phase space is normal when
no accelerator mode exist and it is anomalous (ballistic) when accelerator mode
islands exist even if their area is tiny in the phase space. The local value of
the diffusion exponent inside the normal islands of stability is $\mu=0$, while
inside the accelerator mode islands it is $\mu=2$. The local value of the
diffusion exponent in the chaotic region outside the islands of stability
converges always to the value of 1. The time of convergence can be very long,
depending on the distance from the accelerator mode islands and the value of
the non linearity parameter $K$. For some values of $K$ the stickiness around
the accelerator mode islands is maximum and initial conditions inside the
sticky region can be dragged in a ballistic motion for extremely long times of
the order of $10^7$ or more but they will finally end up in normal mode
diffusion with $\mu=1$. We study, in particular, cases with maximum stickiness
and cases where normal and accelerator mode islands coexist. We find general
analytical solutions of periodic orbits of accelerator type and we give
evidence that they are much more numerous than the normal periodic orbits.
Thus, we expect that in every small interval $\Delta K$ of the non linearity
parameter $K$ of the standard map there exist smaller intervals of accelerator
mode islands. However, these smaller intervals are in general very small, so
that in the majority of the values of $K$ the global diffusion is normal.

  In this paper, we prove the following results:
  - Let $\epsilon > 0$ be a constant. For a sufficiently large constant $n$ and
all $s > n$, if we have an explicit hitting set of size $(s+1)^{n-\epsilon}$
for the class of $n$-variate degree $s$ polynomials that are computable by

radar is leakage between the transmitter and the receiver. The phase noise of
the leakage is expressed as a skirt around the leakage signal on power
spectrum. It causes the deterioration of the dynamic range, especially, in the
near-distance region. Therefore, although FMCW radar has an advantage over
pulse radar in terms of near-distance target detection due to its way of
operation, the advantage of FMCW radar can be lost because of the leakage.
Another problem of FMCW radar is internal delay in the radar system. It leads
to the decrease of the maximum detectable range. In this paper, a novel
down-conversion technique which resolves these problems is proposed. Detailed
theory and procedures to implement the proposed technique are explained. Then,
performances of it are verified with the experiment results. The proposed
technique can be implemented through frequency planning and digital signal

technique lowers the noise floor about 7.0 dB in the near-distance region and
2.1 dB even in the far-distance region. Also, the results demonstrate the

numerical solution of Einstein's equations. It has been shown previously that a
good approximation to the direction of the binary's time-dependent orbital
angular momentum $\mathbf{\hat{L}}(t)$ can be calculated from the

maximises the quadrupolar $(\ell=2,|m|=2)$ emission. The direction depends on

peculiarities to a past mass transfer phase. During which they were polluted by
their binary companion, which at the time was an AGB star, but is now an
extinct white dwarf. Barium stars are thus ideal targets for understanding and
constraining the s-process in low and intermediate-mass AGB stars. We derive
the abundances of a large number of heavy elements in order to shed light on
the conditions of operation of the neutron source responsible for the

a recently used methodology(Neyskens et al. 2015), we analyse a sample of 18
highly enriched barium stars observed with the high-resolution HERMES
spectrograph mounted on the MERCATOR telescope (La Palma). We determine the
stellar parameters and abundances using MARCS model atmospheres. In particular,
we derive the Nb/Zr ratio which was previously shown to be a sensitive
thermometer for the s-process nucleosynthesis. Indeed, in barium stars,
$^{93}Zr$ has fully decayed into mono-isotopic $^{93}Nb$ , so Nb/Zr is a
measure of the temperature-sensitive $^{93}Zr/Zr$ isotopic ratio. HD 28159,
previously classified as K5III and initially selected to serve as a reference
cool K star for our abundance analysis, turns out to be enriched in s-process
elements, and as such is a new barium star. Four stars, characterised by high
nitrogen abundances, also tend to have high [Nb/Zr] and [hs/ls] ratios. The
derived Zr and Nb abundances provide more accurate constraints on the s-process
neutron source, identified to be $^{13}C(alpha,n)^{16}O$ for barium stars. The
comparison with stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis models shows that the
investigated barium stars were polluted by a low-mass (2-3 Solar mass) AGB

Sun, in its three vector components, has evolved during most of cycle 24, from
2010 Jan to 2018 Apr. To filter out the small-scale field of the Sun, present
in high-resolution synoptic maps, we use a spherical harmonic decomposition
method, which decomposes the solar field in multipoles with different l
degrees. By summing together the low-l multipoles, we reconstruct the
large-scale field at a resolution similar to observed stellar magnetic fields,
which allows the direct comparison between solar and stellar magnetic maps.
During cycle 24, the `Sun-as-a-star' magnetic field shows a polarity reversal
in the radial and meridional components, but not in the azimuthal component.
The large-scale solar field remains mainly poloidal with > 70% of its energy
contained in the poloidal component. During its evolution, the large-scale
field is more axisymmetric and more poloidal when near minima in sunspot
numbers, and with a larger intensity near maximum. There is a correlation
between toroidal energy and sunspot number, which indicates that spot fields
are major contributors to the toroidal large-scale energy of the Sun. The solar
large-scale magnetic properties fit smoothly with observational trends of
stellar magnetism reported in See et al. The toroidal (Etor) and poloidal
(Epol) energies are related as Etor ~Epol^{1.38 \pm 0.04}. Similar to the
stellar sample, the large-scale field of the Sun shows a lack of toroidal
non-axisymmetric field.

oscillations determines acceleration which is on average one-directional. The
role of friction is that the velocity reached in the process of the
acceleration is stabilized at a certain level. The second mechanism is due to
the effect of parametric excitation of oscillations, when the internal moving
particle is comparable in mass with the main platform, and, as occurs, a
necessary condition for the acceleration is presence of friction. The
parametric instability and the resulting acceleration of the sleigh turn out to
be bounded if the line of oscillations of the moving mass is displaced from the
center of mass. The steady-state regime of motion is in many cases associated
with a chaotic attractor; accordingly, the motion of the sleigh turns out to be
similar to the process of random walk on a plane.

microscopic thermodynamics, both of which are pertinent in the development of
quantum technologies. The first part is dedicated to the analysis of causal
structure, which encodes the relationship between observed variables, in
general restricting the set of possible correlations between them. Our
considerations rely on a recent entropy vector method. Based on this, we
develop techniques for deriving entropic constraints to differentiate between
causal structures. We provide sufficient conditions for entropy vectors to be
realisable within a causal structure and derive new, improved necessary
conditions in terms of so-called non-Shannon inequalities. We also report that
for a family of causal structures, including the bipartite Bell scenario and
the bilocal causal structure, entropy vectors are unable to distinguish between
classical and quantum causes, in spite of the existence of quantum correlations
that are not classically reproducible. Hence, further development is needed in
order to understand cause from a quantum perspective.
  In the second part we explore an axiomatic framework for modelling
error-tolerant processes in microscopic thermodynamics. Our axiomatisation
allows for the accommodation of finite precision levels, crucial for describing
experiments in the microscopic regime. It leads to the emergence of manageable
quantities that give insights into the feasibility and expenditure of
processes, which for adiabatic processes are shown to be smooth entropy
measures. Our framework also leads to thermodynamic behaviour at the
macroscopic scale, meaning that for thermodynamic equilibrium states a unique
function provides necessary and sufficient conditions for state
transformations, like in the traditional second law.

Assumptions defining a class of observers by means of their 4-velocity $u^{a}$
which is a unit timelike vector field. The geometric assumptions as a rule
concern symmetry assumptions (the so called collineations). The latter
introduces the 1+3 decomposition of tensor fields in spacetime. The 1+3
decomposition results in two major results. The 1+3 decomposition of $u_{a;b}$
defines the kinematic variables of the model (expansion, rotation, shear and
4-acceleration) and defines the kinematics of the gravitational model. The 1+3
decomposition of the energy momentum tensor representing all gravitating matter
introduces the dynamic variables of the model (energy density, the isotropic
pressure, the momentum transfer or heat flux vector and the traceless tensor of
the anisotropic pressure) as measured by the defined observers and define the
dynamics of he model. The symmetries assumed by the model act as constraints on
both the kinematical and the dynamical variables of the model. As a second
further development of the generic model we assume that in addition to the
4-velocity of the observers $u_{a}$ there exists a second universal vector
field $n_{a}$ in spacetime so that one has a so called double congruence
$(u_{a},n_{a})$ which can be used to define the 1+1+2 decomposition of tensor
fields. The 1+1+2 decomposition leads to an extended kinematics concerning both

supermassive black holes in the early universe. This chapter summarizes recent
theoretical efforts to understand their evolution, highlighting effects of very
rapid accretion at the rates of $\dot{M}_* \gtrsim 0.1~$M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.
Stellar evolution calculations predict that such an accreting SMS has a
characteristic feature, i.e., a very large radius that monotonically increases
as the stellar mass increases. The radius exceeds $7000$ R$_\odot$ (or $30$ AU)
after the star accretes the gas of more than $10^3$ M$_\odot$. We show that the
emergence of the ""supergiant protostar"" stage is a key for the formation of
SMSs, because resulting radiative feedback against the accretion flow is
substantially weakened during this stage. We also show that these SMSs end
their lives while the accretion continues, and that their final fates vary with
different accretion rates.

synthesizing high-resolution photographic images. IntroVAE is capable of
self-evaluating the quality of its generated samples and improving itself
accordingly. Its inference and generator models are jointly trained in an
introspective way. On one hand, the generator is required to reconstruct the
input images from the noisy outputs of the inference model as normal VAEs. On
the other hand, the inference model is encouraged to classify between the
generated and real samples while the generator tries to fool it as GANs. These
two famous generative frameworks are integrated in a simple yet efficient
single-stream architecture that can be trained in a single stage. IntroVAE
preserves the advantages of VAEs, such as stable training and nice latent
manifold. Unlike most other hybrid models of VAEs and GANs, IntroVAE requires
no extra discriminators, because the inference model itself serves as a
discriminator to distinguish between the generated and real samples.
Experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-resolution
photo-realistic images (e.g., CELEBA images at \(1024^{2}\)), which are
comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art GANs.

only representation that used |T|H_k(T) bits was based on XBWT, a
transformation that linearizes tree labels into a single string, combined with
compression boosting. The proposed representation is much simpler than the one
based on XBWT, which used additional linear space (bounded by 0.01n) hidden in
the ""smaller order terms"" notion, as an artifact of using zeroth order entropy
coder; our representation uses sublinear additional space (for reasonable
values of k and size of the label alphabet {\sigma}). The proposed
representation can be naturally extended to a succinct data structure for

eruptive capability of solar active regions. Several such quantitative
predictors have been proposed in the literature, inferred mostly from
photospheric magnetograms and/or white-light observations. Two of them are the
Ising energy and the sum of the total horizontal magnetic field gradient. The
former has been developed from line-of-sight magnetograms, while the latter
uses sunspot detections and characteristics, based on continuum images. Aiming
to include these parameters in an automated prediction scheme, we test their
applicability on regular photospheric magnetic field observations provided by
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument onboard the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We test their efficiency as predictors of flaring
activity on a representative sample of active regions and investigate possible
modifications of these quantities. The Ising energy appears to be an efficient
predictor, and the efficiency is even improved if it is modified to describe
interacting magnetic partitions or sunspot umbrae. The sum of the horizontal
magnetic field gradient appears to be slightly more promising than the three
variations of the Ising energy we implement in this article. The new predictors
are also compared with two very promising predictors: the effective connected
magnetic field strength and the total unsigned non-neutralized current. Our
analysis shows that the efficiency of morphological predictors depends on
projection effects in a nontrivial way. All four new predictors are found
useful for inclusion in an automated flare forecasting facility, such as the
Flare Likelihood and Region Eruption Forecasting (FLARECAST), but their
utility, among others, will ultimately be determined by the validation effort
underway in the framework of the FLARECAST project.

discussed in the literature on the foundations of quantum mechanics. Recently,
it has become particularly relevant due to a proposed criterion of the physical
reality of a given quantum mechanical observable [A. L. O. Bilobran and R. M.
Angelo, Europhys. Lett. 112, 40005 (2015)]. We examine this proposal and its
consequently related measure of non-locality [V. S. Gomez and R. M. Angelo,
Phys. Rev. A 97, 012123, (2018)] and argue that the criterion is ill-described
as quantifying physical reality without introducing serious inconsistency with
the basic notions of realism that under-gird enquiry. We agree that this
reality criterion demonstrates, along with the famous GHZ results, that general
quantum observable values make for poor elements of reality. However, we also
argue that this does not mean no such elements of reality are to be found in
quantum theory. By arguing for, and adopting, probability distributions as
these elements of reality instead, we demonstrate that the criterion of
physical reality is actually one of observable predictability. We then examine
the relationship of realism-based non-locality to the Bell form and find that,
despite the flawed premise, this measure does indeed codify non-locality that
is not captured by Bell inequalities.

the local electric field at the position of the quantum dot. The standard

photon noise suppression in large arrays of single photon emitters and promises

while the metal rich (MR) one peaks at [Fe/H]$~+0.3. The total metallicity
distribution function is therefore bimodal, with a dip at [Fe/H]~0. The
relative fraction of the two components changes significantly across the bulge
area. We provide, for the first time, the fractional contribution of the MP and
MR stars to the stellar mass budget of the Galactic bulge, and its variation
across the bulge area. We find that MP stars make up 48% of the total stellar
mass of the bulge, within the region |l|<10, |b|<9.5, with the remaining 52%
made up of MR stars. The latter dominate the mass budget at intermediate
latitudes |b|~4, but become marginal in the outer bulge (|b|>8). The MP
component is more axisymmetric than the MR one, and it is at least comparable,
and possibly slightly dominant in the inner few degrees. As a result, the MP
component, which does not follow the main bar, is not marginal in terms of the
total mass budget as previously thought, and this new observational evidence
must be included in bulge models. While the total radial velocity dispersion
has a trend that follows the total stellar mass, when we examine the velocity
dispersion of each component individually, we find that MP stars have higher
velocity dispersion where they make up a smaller fraction of the stellar mass,
and viceversa. This is due to the kinematical and spatial distribution of the
two metallicity component being significantly different, as already discussed
in the literature.

has seen significant improvement in restoring the linear baryonic acoustic
oscillation (BAO) from at least the non-linear matter field. This outstanding
performance is achieved by iteratively solving the Monge-Ampere equation of the
mass conservation. However, this technique also relies on several assumptions
that are not valid in reality, namely the longitudinal displacement, the
absence of shell-crossing and homogeneous initial condition. In particular, the
conservation equation of the tracers comprises the biasing information that
breaks down the last assumption. Consequently, direct reconstruction would
entangle the non-linear displacement with complicated bias parameters and
further affect the BAO. In this paper, we formulate a theoretical model
describing the reconstructed biased map by matching the tracer overdensity with
an auxiliary fluid with vanishing initial perturbation. Regarding the
performance of the reconstruction algorithm, we show that even though the shot
noise is still the most significant limiting factors in a realistic survey,
inappropriate treatment of the bias could also shift the reconstructed frame
and therefore broaden the BAO peak. We suggest that, in principle, this
bias-related BAO smearing effect could be used to independently self-calibrate
the bias parameters.

observed in many examples, whereby noncommutative spaces (or equivalently their
coordinate algebras) have very few automorphisms by comparison with their

  In the framework of noncommutative projective geometry, we define a groupoid
whose objects are noncommutative projective spaces of a given dimension and
whose morphisms correspond to isomorphisms of these. This groupoid is then a
natural generalization of an automorphism group. Using work of Zhang, we may
translate this structure to the algebraic side, wherein we consider homogeneous
coordinate algebras of noncommutative projective spaces. The morphisms in our
groupoid precisely correspond to the existence of a Zhang twist relating the
two coordinate algebras.
  We analyse this automorphism groupoid, showing that in dimension 1 it is
connected, so that every noncommutative $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ is isomorphic to
commutative $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. For dimension 2 and above, we use the geometry of
the point scheme, as introduced by Artin-Tate-Van den Bergh, to relate
morphisms in our groupoid to certain automorphisms of the point scheme.
  We apply our results to two important examples, quantum projective spaces and
Sklyanin algebras. In both cases, we are able to use the geometry of the point
schemes to fully describe the corresponding component of the automorphism
groupoid. This provides a concrete description of the collection of Zhang
twists of these algebras.

neutrons depending on their energy spectrum. This is achieved because the
material, firstly, has high content of Gd, which absorbs neutrons with
following emission of $\gamma$-quanta, and, secondly, detects this radiation
efficiently thanks to high stopping power, fast scintillation kinetics, high
scintillation light yield and good energy resolution. It was shown by

$\gamma$-quanta pulse height spectra acquired with GAGG:Ce crystal under

active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the SDSS, particularly examining the joint
dependence on galaxy mass and color. AGN in galaxies with blue colors or
massive red galaxies with M*>~10^{10.5}Msun are found to show almost identical
clustering amplitudes at all scales to control galaxies of the same mass, color
and structural parameters. This suggests AGN activity in blue galaxies or
massive red galaxies is regulated by internal processes, with no correlation
with environment. The antibias of AGN at scales between ~100kpc and a few Mpc,
as found in Li et al. (2006) for the AGN as a whole, is observed only for the
AGN hosted by galaxies with red colors and relatively low masses
<10^{10.5}Msun. A simple halo model in which AGN are preferentially found at
dark halo centers can reproduce the observational results, but requiring a
mass-dependent central fraction which is a factor of ~4 higher than the
fraction estimated from the SDSS group catalogue. The same group catalogue
reveals that the host groups of AGN in red satellites tend to have lower halo
masses than control galaxies, while the host groups of AGN in red centrals tend
to form earlier, as indicated by a larger stellar mass gap between the two most
massive galaxies in the groups. Our result implies that the mass assembly
history of dark halos may play an additional role in the AGN activity in
low-mass red galaxies.

allows for better and efficient cognitive performance. Many of these cognitive
functions are very fast and occur in subsecond time scale such as the visual
object recognition. Here, we investigate brain network modularity while
controlling stimuli meaningfulness and measuring participant reaction time. We
particularly raised two questions: i) does the dynamic brain network modularity
change during the recognition of meaningful and meaningless visual images? And
ii) is there a correlation between network modularity and the reaction time of
participants? To tackle these issues, we collected dense electroencephalography
(EEG, 256 channels) data from 20 healthy human subjects performing a cognitive
task consisting of naming meaningful (tools, animals) and meaningless
(scrambled) images. Functional brain networks in both categories were estimated
at subsecond time scale using the EEG source connectivity method. By using
multislice modularity algorithms, we tracked the reconfiguration of functional
networks during the recognition of both meaningful and meaningless images.
Results showed a difference in the module characteristics of both conditions in
term of integration (interactions between modules) and occurrence (probability
on average of any two brain regions to fall in the same module during the
task). Integration and occurrence were greater for meaningless than for
meaningful images. Our findings revealed also that the occurrence within the
right frontal regions and the left occipito-temporal can help to predict the
ability of the brain to rapidly recognize and name visual stimuli. We speculate
that these observations are applicable not only to other fast cognitive
functions but also to detect fast disconnections that can occur in some brain
disorders.

dramatically fewer resources to represent a given function compared to a
shallow network. But a question remains: can these efficient representations be
learned using current deep learning techniques? In this work, we test whether
standard deep learning methods can in fact find the efficient representations
posited by several theories of deep representation. Specifically, we train deep
neural networks to learn two simple functions with known efficient solutions:
the parity function and the fast Fourier transform. We find that using
gradient-based optimization, a deep network does not learn the parity function,
unless initialized very close to a hand-coded exact solution. We also find that
a deep linear neural network does not learn the fast Fourier transform, even in
the best-case scenario of infinite training data, unless the weights are
initialized very close to the exact hand-coded solution. Our results suggest
that not every element of the class of compositional functions can be learned
efficiently by a deep network, and further restrictions are necessary to
understand what functions are both efficiently representable and learnable.

probability-conserving dynamics which makes rare trajectories of the original
dynamics become typical trajectories of the effective one. Our approach makes
use of a weak-noise path-integral description in which the action is minimised
by the rare trajectories of interest. For `current-type' additive observables,
we find the emergence of a propagative trajectory minimising the action for
large enough deviations, revealing the existence of a dynamical phase
transition at a fluctuating level. In addition, we provide a new method to
determine the scaled cumulant generating function of the observable without
having to optimise the action. It allows one to show that the weak-noise and
the large-time limits commute in this problem. Finally, we show how the biased
dynamics can be mapped in practice to an effective driven dynamics, which takes
the form of a driven Langevin dynamics in an effective potential. The
non-trivial shape of this effective potential is key to understand the link

updates (turnstile model). We design a $P$-pass quantum streaming algorithm
with memory $M$ satisfying a tradeoff of $P^2 M = \tilde{O}(n^{1-2/k})$,
whereas the best classical algorithm requires $P M = \Theta(n^{1-2/k})$. Then,
we study the problem of estimating the number $m$ of edges and the number $t$
of triangles given query access to an $n$-vertex graph. We describe optimal
quantum algorithms that perform $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/m^{1/4})$ and
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/t^{1/6} + m^{3/4}/\sqrt{t})$ queries respectively. This is
a quadratic speed-up compared to the classical complexity of these problems.
  For this purpose we develop a new quantum paradigm that we call Quantum
Chebyshev's inequality. Namely we demonstrate that, in a certain model of
quantum sampling, one can approximate with relative error the mean of any
random variable with a number of quantum samples that is linear in the ratio of
the square root of the variance to the mean. Classically the dependency is
quadratic. Our algorithm subsumes a previous result of Montanaro [Mon15]. This
new paradigm is based on a refinement of the Amplitude Estimation algorithm of
Brassard et al. [BHMT02] and of previous quantum algorithms for the mean
estimation problem. We show that this speed-up is optimal, and we identify
another common model of quantum sampling where it cannot be obtained. For our
applications, we also adapt the variable-time amplitude amplification technique
of Ambainis [Amb10] into a variable-time amplitude estimation algorithm.

severely degrades the performance of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
(OFDM)systems. One of the simplest methods to reduce IN is to precede the OFDM
demodulator with a blanking non-linearity processor. In this respect, Selective
Mapping (SLM) applied to an OFDM signal before the transmitter does not only
reduce Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) but also increases the resulting
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when blanking nonlinearity is applied at the
receiver. This paper highlights another advantage of SLM based IN reduction,
which is the reduced dependency on threshold used for blanking nonlinearity.
The simulation results show that the optimal threshold to achieve maximum SNR
is found to be constant for phase vectors greater than or equal to 64 in the
SLM scheme. If the optimized threshold calculation method is used, the output
SNR with SLM OFDM will result in SNR gains of up to 8.6dB compared to the
unmodified system, i.e. without implementing SLM. Moreover, by using SLM, we
not only get the advantage of low peak power, but also the need to calculate
optimized threshold is eliminated, thereby reducing the additional computation.

characteristics of the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy RE J1034+396. We use data
obtained from the AstroSat satellite along with the light curves obtained from
XMM-Newton and Swift-XRT. We use the 0.3 - 7.0 keV and 3 - 20 keV data,
respectively, from the SXT and the LAXPC of AstroSat. The X-ray spectra in the
0.3 - 20 keV region are well fit with a model consisting of a power-law and a
soft excess described by a thermal-Compton emission with a large optical depth,
consistent with the earlier reported results. We have examined the X-ray light
curves in the soft and hard X-ray bands of SXT and LAXPC, respectively, and
find that the variability is slightly larger in the hard band. To investigate
the variability characteristics of this source at different time scales, we
have used X-ray light curves obtained from XMM-Newton data (200 s to 100 ks
range) and Swift-XRT data (1 day to 100 day range) and find that there are
evidences to suggest that the variability sharply increases at longer time
scales. We argue that the mass of the black hole in RE J1034+396 is likely to
be $\sim$3 $\times$ 10$^6$ M$_\odot$, based on the similarity of the observed
QPO to the high frequency QPO seen in the Galactic black hole binary, GRS

cooperative incremental redundancy retransmissions in the slow-fading
half-duplex multiple access multiple relay channel. Time Division Multiple
Access is assumed for the sources and the relays. Sources transmit successively
in time slots for the first phase. The second phase consists of a limited
number of time slots for retransmissions. In each time slot, the destination
schedules a node (being a relay or a source) to retransmit, conditional on the
knowledge of the correctly decoded source sets of each node (which is itself
for a source). A scheduled relay retransmission uses Joint Network and Channel
Coding on its correctly decoded source messages (cooperative retransmission).
Several node selection strategies are proposed based on the maximization of the
long-term aggregate throughput under a given constraint of fairness.
Monte-Carlo simulations show that these strategies outperform the state of the
art one based on the minimization of the probability of the common outage event
after each time-slot. Moreover, the long-term aggregate throughput reached with
these strategies is close to the upper-bound, calculated by the exhaustive
search approach. The same conclusion remains valid for both symmetric and
asymmetric source rate scenarios.

there exists a string $s^*$ with $\big(\sum_{s \in S}d^p(s^*,s)\big)^{1/p} \leq

important applications in data clustering, and is a generalization of the
well-known polynomial-time solvable \textsc{Consensus String} $(p=1)$ problem,
as well as the NP-hard \textsc{Closest String} $(p=\infty)$ problem.
  Our main result shows that the problem is NP-hard for all fixed rational $p >

interest from a variety of inference, learning, and sampling settings in
machine learning, computer vision, statistical physics, and theoretical
computer science. While the problem of sampling from a static graphical model
has received considerable attention, theoretical works for its dynamic variants
have been largely lacking. The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm
that can sample dynamically from a broad class of graphical models over
discrete random variables. Our algorithm is parallel and Las Vegas: it knows
when to stop and it outputs samples from the exact distribution. We also
provide sufficient conditions under which this algorithm runs in time
proportional to the size of the update, on general graphical models as well as
well-studied specific spin systems. In particular we obtain, for the Ising
model (ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic) and for the hardcore model the
first dynamic sampling algorithms that can handle both edge and vertex updates
(addition, deletion, change of functions), both efficient within regimes that
are close to the respective uniqueness regimes, beyond which, even for the
static and approximate sampling, no local algorithms were known or the problem
itself is intractable. Our dynamic sampling algorithm relies on a local
resampling algorithm and a new ""equilibrium"" property that is shown to be
satisfied by our algorithm at each step, and enables us to prove its
correctness. This equilibrium property is robust enough to guarantee the
correctness of our algorithm, helps us improve bounds on fast convergence on
specific models, and should be of independent interest.

two of the cherished features of low-energy supersymmetric models. Putting
aside questions of naturalness, supersymmetry might only be realised in nature
at very high energy scales. If this is the case, the preservation of gauge
coupling unification and the stability of the Higgs vacuum would certainly
require new physics, but it need not necessarily be at weak scale energies. New
physics near the unification scale could in principle ensure Grand Unification,
while new physics below $\mu \sim 10^{10}$ GeV could ensure the stability of
the Higgs vacuum. Surprisingly however, we find that in the context of a
supersymmetric SO(10) Grand Unified Theory, gauge coupling unification and the
Higgs vacuum stability, when taken in conjunction with existing
phenomenological constraints, require the presence of $\mathcal{O}$(TeV)-scale
physics. This weak-scale physics takes the form of a complex scalar SU(2)$_L$
triplet with zero hypercharge, originating from the $\mathbf{210}$ of SO(10).

consistent with particle trapping in giant vortices. The formation and survival
of vortices is of major importance for planet formation, because vortices act
as particle traps and are therefore preferred locations of planetesimal
formation. Recent studies showed that the vertical shear instability (VSI) is
capable of generating turbulence and small vortices in protoplanetary disks
that have the proper radial and vertical stratification and thermally relax on
sufficiently short time scales. But the effect of the azimuthal extend of the
disk is often neglected as the disks azimuth is limited to $\Delta \phi \leq
\pi/2$. We aim to investigate the influence of the azimuthal extent of the disk
on the long-term evolution of a protoplanetary disk and the possibility of
large vortices forming. To this end, we perform 3-dimensional simulations for
up to 1000 local orbits using different values of $\Delta \phi = \pi/2 $ to
$2\pi$ for VSI in disks with a prescribed radial density and temperature
gradient cooling on short timescales. We find the VSI capable of forming large
vortices which can exist at least several hundred orbits in simulations
covering a disk with $\Delta \phi \geq \pi$. This suggests the VSI to be
capable to form vortices or at least to trigger vortex formation via a
secondary instability, e.g. Rossby Wave Instability or Kelvin Helmholtz
Instability.

asymptotically as the number of samples increases. Similarly, the worst loss in
information rate vanishes in the interior of the energy domain, however, does
not always vanish at maximal energy. We further show the same principle applies
in multicast settings such as medium access in the Wi-Fi protocol. We also
consider the end-to-end source-channel communication problem under source

scale this magnetic storm with auroral extension and contextualise it based on
contemporary solar activity. Methods. We examined historical records in East
Asia and computed the magnetic latitude (MLAT) of observational sites to scale
magnetic storms. We also compared them with auroral records in Southern Europe.
We examined contemporary sunspot observations to reconstruct detailed solar
activity between 1729 and 1731. Results. We show 29 auroral records in East
Asian historical documents and 37 sunspot observations. Conclusions. These
records show that the auroral displays were visible at least down to 25.8{\deg}
MLAT throughout East Asia. In comparison with contemporary European records, we
show that the boundary of the auroral display closest to the equator surpassed
45.1{\deg} MLAT and possibly came down to 31.5{\deg} MLAT in its maximum phase,

constraint significantly changes the structure of the problem: we construct a
policy and show that its regret after $T$ time periods is bounded above by a
constant times $T^{2/3}$ (up to a logarithmic term); in addition, we show that
the regret of any policy is bounded from below by a positive constant times

the $\Gamma$ of redbacks are apparently smaller than those of black-widows,
which indicates the X-ray emission of redbacks are harder than that of

shape-asymmetric active microswimmers tend to show a persistent curvature of
their trajectories. Consequently, we here present a particle-scale statistical
approach of circle-swimmer suspensions in terms of a dynamical density
functional theory. It is based on a minimal microswimmer model and,
particularly, includes hydrodynamic interactions between the swimmers. After
deriving the theory, we numerically investigate a planar example situation of
confining the swimmers in a circularly symmetric potential trap. There, we find
that increasing curvature of the swimming trajectories can reverse the
qualitative effect of active drive. More precisely, with increasing curvature,
the swimmers less effectively push outwards against the confinement, but
instead form high-density patches in the center of the trap. We conclude that
the circular motion of the individual swimmers has a localizing effect, also in
the presence of hydrodynamic interactions. Parts of our results could be
confirmed experimentally, for instance, using suspensions of L-shaped circle
swimmers of different aspect ratio.

case, each value in the data, falling into different windows, will be processed
many times, increasing the complexity of the algorithm and the processing time.
We took this fact into account and optimized the correlation calculation in the
sliding window, reducing the number of operations in the overlapping area of
the windows. In addition, we developed a parallel version of the optimized
algorithm for the GPU architecture. Experimental studies have shown that for a
7x7 correlation window sliding in one pixel increments, we were able to
accelerate the processing of an 12 MPixel image pixels on the GPU by about 60
times compared to the serial version running on the CPU. The article presents
an optimized version of the algorithm, a scheme for its parallelization, as
well as the results of experimental studies.

of Inflation (gEEFToI), in which the coefficients of the sixth order polynomial
dispersion relation depend on the physical wavelength of the fluctuation mode,
hence they are time-dependent. At arbitrarily short wavelengths the unitarity
is lost for each mode. Depending on the values of the gEEFToI parameters in the
unitary gauge action, two scenarios can arise: in one, the coefficients of the
polynomial become singular, flip signs at some physical wavelength and
asymptote to a constant value as the wavelength of the mode is stretched to
infinity. Starting from the WKB vacuum, the two-point function is essentially
singular in the infinite IR limit. In the other case, the coefficients of the
dispersion relation evolve monotonically from zero to a constant value in the
infinite IR. In order to have a finite power spectrum starting from the vacuum
in this case, the mode function has to be an eigensolution of the Confluent
Heun (CH) equation, which leads to a very confined parameter space for gEEFToI.
Finally, I look at a solution of the CH equation which is regular in the
infinite IR limit and yields a finite power spectrum in either scenario. I
demonstrate that this solution asymptotes to an excited state in past infinity
in both cases. The result is interpreted in the light of the loss of unitarity
for very small wavelengths. The outcome of such a non-unitary phase evolution
should prepare each mode in the excited initial state that yields a finite
two-point function for all the parameter space. This will be constraining of
the new physics that UV completes such scenarios.

collapse. Early dustlike stages of dominance of heavy metastable dissipative
particles, at which star-like objects are formed, can also naturally lead to
formation of black hole clusters, remaining in the Universe after decay of

clusters discussed here is of the crucial importance. Such a model inherits all
the advantages of the single PBHs like possible explanation of existence of
supermassive black holes (origin of the early quasars), binary BH merges
registered by LIGO/Virgo through gravitational waves, contribution to
reionization of the Universe, but also has additional benefits. The cluster
could alleviate or completely avoid existing constraints on the single PBH
abundance making PBHs a real dark matter candidate. The most of existing
constraints on (single) PBH density should be re-considered as applied to the
clusters. Also unidentified cosmic gamma-ray point-like sources could be
(partially) accounted for by them. One can conclude, that it seems really to be
much more viable model with respect to the single PBHs.

luminous QSOs at redshifts as large as seven. There is a sheer difficulty in
forming giant black holes of billion suns in less than one billion years. This
has led to the concept of seed black holes. They are high redshift intermediate
mass black holes that formed during cosmic dawn. Seeds are a transient
population, which later grew massive through episodes of accretion and mergers.
In this chapter we explore the possibility of discovering seed black holes and
track their growth across all cosmic epoch, by detecting the gravitational wave
signal they emit at the time of their coalescence, when they pair to form close
binaries. We show that the ESA LISA mission for the detection of low frequency
gravitational waves will be paramount in granting this insight. Gravitational
waves travel unimpeded through the cosmos and carry exquisite information on
the masses and spins of the merging black holes. To this purpose we introduce
key concepts on the gravitational wave emission from binaries, describing
briefly their formation pathway during halo mergers and galaxy collisions.

signals that are invisible (to be made precise) to the observer at $p$. Part of
the initial data on a Cauchy surface, required to predict what happens at $q$,
is also invisible to the observer at $p$. Therefore it is not possible for any
observer to predict a future event with certainty. The uncertainty increases as
one attempts to predict further future. An observer at $p$ can access the
entire data to determine what happens at $q$, if and only if $q \in J^-(p)$.
Classical uncertainty in prediction is not an intrinsic feature of the events

next-generation cellular networks to meet the demands of fast-growing mobile
data traffic with plentiful spectrum available. However, in a mmWave cellular
system, the shadowing and blockage effects lead to the intermittent
connectivity, and the handovers are more frequent. This paper investigates an
``all-mmWave'' cloud radio access network (cloud-RAN), in which both the
fronthaul and the radio access links operate at mmWave. To address the
intermittent transmissions, we allow the mobile users (MUs) to establish
multiple connections to the central unit over the remote radio heads (RRHs).
Specifically, we propose a multipath transmission framework by leveraging the
``all-mmWave'' cloud-RAN architecture, which makes decisions of the RRH
association and the packet transmission scheduling according to the
time-varying network statistics, such that a MU experiences the minimum
queueing delay and packet drops. The joint RRH association and transmission
scheduling problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). Due to the
problem size, a low-complexity online learning scheme is put forward, which
requires no a priori statistic information of network dynamics. Simulations
show that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-art baselines, in terms
of average queue length and average packet dropping rate.

lies in how to support diverse services for mobile users (MUs) over a common

tailor the network to match such service requests. This paper considers a
system with radio access network (RAN)-only slicing, where the physical
infrastructure is split into slices providing computation and communication
functionalities. A limited number of channels are auctioned across scheduling
slots to MUs of multiple service providers (SPs) (i.e., the tenants). Each SP
behaves selfishly to maximize the expected long-term payoff from the
competition with other SPs for the orchestration of channels, which provides
its MUs with the opportunities to access the computation and communication
slices. This problem is modelled as a stochastic game, in which the decision
makings of a SP depend on the global network dynamics as well as the joint
control policy of all SPs. To approximate the Nash equilibrium solutions, we
first construct an abstract stochastic game with the local conjectures of
channel auction among the SPs. We then linearly decompose the per-SP Markov
decision process to simplify the decision makings at a SP and derive an online
scheme based on deep reinforcement learning to approach the optimal abstract
control policies. Numerical experiments show significant performance gains from
our scheme.

efficiently perform parallelizable small operations. The attempt of executing
the computation graph in parallel in deep learning frameworks usually involves
much resource contention among concurrent operations, leading to inferior

minimizes the interference on both software/hardware resources, discovers the
best parallel setting with a profiler, and further optimizes graph execution

space, exact results on the distribution of the first hitting time to a given
set $G$ are obtained. A new notion of ""strong metastability time"" is introduced
to describe the local relaxation time. This time is defined via a
generalization of the strong stationary time to a ""conditionally strong
quasi-stationary time""(CSQST). Rarity of the target set $G$ is not required and
the initial distribution can be completely general. The results clarify the the
role played by the initial distribution on the exponential law; they are used
to give a general notion of metastability and to discuss the relation between
the exponential distribution of the first hitting time and metastability.

equations in non co propagating plane waves is found. The solutions are based
on the physical principle of maintaining local gauge invariance in the Furry
picture Lagrangian when N external fields can undergo independent gauge
transformations. The solutions can be expressed in terms of the Hamilton Jacobi
action and a gauge invariant effective particle momentum in the ensemble of
external fields. Rotations of the effective particle momentum, which preserve
local gauge invariance, are introduced into the action using matrix calculus.
The set of such rotations provides the class of new solutions constituting a
family of Volkov like solutions for one external field. When applied to two or
more non co propagating external fields, the rotational symmetry provides
counter terms which decouple the fields. The bound state equations of motion
become solvable for any number of non co propagating external fields. Through
angular spectral decomposition, which represents electromagnetic fields of any
form as a spatial Fourier series of non co propagating plane waves, the new
solutions described here can be applied to strong field physics problems in any
external electromagnetic field.

theory of self-organized criticality (SOC) was proposed to explain their
origins. A longstanding principle of SOC is the \emph{separation of timescales}
axiom. It dictates that external input is delivered to the system at a much
slower rate compared to the timescale of internal dynamics. The statistics of
neural avalanches in the brain was demonstrated to follow a power law,
indicating closeness to a critical state. Moreover, criticality was shown to be
a beneficial state for various computations leading to the hypothesis, that the
brain is a SOC system. However, for neuronal systems that are constantly
bombarded by incoming signals, separation of timescales assumption is
unnatural. Recently it was experimentally demonstrated that a proper correction
of the avalanche detection algorithm to account for the increased drive during
task performance leads to a change of the power-law exponent from $1.5$ to
approximately $1.3$, but there is so far no theoretical explanation for this
change. Here we investigate the importance of timescales separation, by partly
abandoning it in various models. We achieve it by allowing for external input
during the avalanche, without compromising the separation of avalanches. We
develop an analytic treatment and provide numerical simulations of a simple
neuronal model.

rupture, the overall conductivity of the blood increases. Here, we demonstrate
that small changes in porcine blood hemolysis can be detected accurately
through a simple resistance measurement.

integration of computational tools into the materials and parts development
cycle, while the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) calls for the acceleration
of the materials development cycle through the combination of experiments,
simulation, and data. As they stand, both ICME and MGI do not prescribe how to
achieve the necessary tool integration or how to efficiently exploit the
computational tools, in combination with experiments, to accelerate the
development of new materials and materials systems. This paper addresses the
first issue by putting forward a framework for the fusion of information that
exploits correlations among sources/models and between the sources and `ground
truth'. The second issue is addressed through a multi-information source
optimization framework that identifies, given current knowledge, the next best
information source to query and where in the input space to query it via a
novel value-gradient policy. The querying decision takes into account the
ability to learn correlations between information sources, the resource cost of
querying an information source, and what a query is expected to provide in
terms of improvement over the current state. The framework is demonstrated on
the optimization of a dual-phase steel to maximize its strength-normalized
strain hardening rate. The ground truth is represented by a
microstructure-based finite element model while three low fidelity information
sources---i.e. reduced order models---based on different homogenization
assumptions---isostrain, isostress and isowork---are used to efficiently and
optimally query the materials design space.
