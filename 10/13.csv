the 2D self-position of the agent is represented by a high-dimensional vector,

The model consists of the following three sub-models. (1) Vector-matrix
multiplication. The movement from the current position to the next position is
modeled by matrix-vector multiplication, i.e., the vector of the next position
is obtained by multiplying the matrix of the motion to the vector of the
current position. (2) Magnified local isometry. The angle between two nearby
vectors equals the Euclidean distance between the two corresponding positions
multiplied by a magnifying factor. (3) Global adjacency kernel. The inner
product between two vectors measures the adjacency between the two
corresponding positions, which is defined by a kernel function of the Euclidean
distance between the two positions. Our representational model has explicit
algebra and geometry. It can learn hexagon patterns of grid cells, and it is
capable of error correction, path integral and path planning.

of attention as ensuring it will ensure continued confidence of the general
public in the deployment of machine learning systems. We focus on mitigating
the harm incurred by a biased machine learning system that offers better
outputs (e.g. loans, job interviews) for certain groups than for others. We
show that bias in the output can naturally be controlled in probabilistic
models by introducing a latent target output. This formulation has several
advantages: first, it is a unified framework for several notions of group
fairness such as Demographic Parity and Equality of Opportunity; second, it is
expressed as a marginalisation instead of a constrained problem; and third, it
allows the encoding of our knowledge of what unbiased outputs should be.
Practically, the second allows us to avoid unstable constrained optimisation
procedures and to reuse off-the-shelf toolboxes. The latter translates to the
ability to control the level of fairness by directly varying fairness target
rates. In contrast, existing approaches rely on intermediate, arguably
unintuitive, control parameters such as covariance thresholds.

behavior, where access by a core to data cached locally on a socket is much
faster than access to data cached on a remote socket. Prior work offers several
efficient NUMA-aware locks that exploit this behavior by keeping the lock
ownership on the same socket, thus reducing remote cache misses and
inter-socket communication. Virtually all those locks, however, are
hierarchical in their nature, thus requiring space proportional to the number
of sockets. The increased memory cost renders NUMA-aware locks unsuitable for
systems that are conscious to space requirements of their synchronization
constructs, with the Linux kernel being the chief example.
  In this work, we present a compact NUMA-aware lock that requires only one
word of memory, regardless of the number of sockets in the underlying machine.
The new lock is a variant of an efficient (NUMA-oblivious) MCS lock, and
inherits its performant features, such as local spinning and a single atomic
instruction in the acquisition path. Unlike MCS, the new lock organizes waiting
threads in two queues, one composed of threads running on the same socket as
the current lock holder, and another composed of threads running on a different
socket(s).
  We integrated the new lock in the Linux kernel's qspinlock, one of the major
synchronization constructs in the kernel. Our evaluation using both user-space
and kernel benchmarks shows that the new lock has a single-thread performance
of MCS, but significantly outperforms the latter under contention, achieving a
similar level of performance when compared to other, state-of-the-art
NUMA-aware locks that require substantially more space.

the topology of unparametrized curves, as well as in a topology inherited from
the unit disc via conformal maps. We complement this result by proving that
proceeding to weak limit commutes with changing topology, i.e., limits of
conformal images are conformal images of limits, with minimal boundary
regularity assumptions on the domains where the random curves lie. Such rough
boundaries are especially interesting if, in the context of multiple random
curves, a limit candidate is defined in terms of iterated SLE type processes

experience environmental stochasticity. Our work generalizes the current
literature significantly by taking into account non-linear interactions between
species, state-dependent prices, and species injections. The key generalization
is making it possible to not only harvest, but also `seed' individuals into the
ecosystem. This is motivated by how fisheries and certain endangered species
are controlled. The harvesting problem becomes finding the optimal
harvesting-seeding strategy that maximizes the expected total income from the
harvest minus the lost income from the species injections. Our analysis shows
that new phenomena emerge due to the possibility of species injections.
  It is well-known that multidimensional harvesting problems are very hard to
tackle. We are able to make progress, by characterizing the value function as a
viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations.
Moreover, we provide a verification theorem, which tells us that if a function
has certain properties, then it will be the value function. This allows us to
show heuristically, as was shown in Lungu and $\O$ksendal (Bernoulli '01), that
it is almost surely never optimal to harvest or seed from more than one
population at a time.
  We approximate the continuous-time systems by Markov chains and show that the
optimal harvesting-seeding strategies of the Markov chain approximations
converge to the correct optimal harvesting strategy. This is used to provide
numerical approximations to the optimal harvesting-seeding strategies and is a
first step towards a full understanding of the intricacies of how one should
harvest and seed interacting species. In particular, we look at three examples:
one species modeled by a Verhulst-Pearl diffusion, two competing species and a
two-species predator-prey system.

results together with uncertainties even for weak B-class flare events. More
than 96% of flares demonstrate a sequential appearance of T, SXR, and EM
maxima, in agreement with the expected behavior of the chromospheric
evaporation process. The relative number of such flares increases with
increasing the SXR flux maximum. The SXR maximum is closer in time to the T
maximum for B-class flares than for >=C-class flares, while it is very close to
the EM maximum for M- and X-class flares. We define flares as ""T-controlled"" if
the time interval between the SXR and T maxima is at least two times shorter
than the interval between the EM and SXR maxima, and as ""EM-controlled"" if the
time interval between the EM and SXR maxima is at least two times shorter than
the interval between the SXR and T maxima. For any considered flare class
range, the T-controlled events compared to EM-controlled events have: a) higher
EM but lower T; b) longer durations and shorter relative growth times; c)
longer FWHM and characteristic decay times. Interpretation of these statistical
results based on analysis of a single loop dynamics suggests that for flares of
the same class range, the T-controlled events can be developed in longer loops
than the EM-controlled events.

many, if not all primordial disks consist of ring-like dust structures. The
origin of these dust rings remains unclear, but a common explanation is the
presence of planetary companions that have cleared gaps along their orbit and
trapped the dust at the gap edge. A signature of this scenario is a decrease of
gas density inside these gaps. In recent work, Isella et al. 2016 derived drops
in gas density consistent with Saturn-mass planets inside the gaps in the
HD163296 disk through spatially resolved CO isotopologue observations. However,
as CO abundance and temperature depends on a large range of factors, the
interpretation of CO emission is non-trivial. We use the physical-chemical code
DALI to show that the gas temperature increases inside dust density gaps,
implying that any gaps in the gas, if present, would have to be much deeper,
consistent with planet masses higher than a Jupiter mass. Furthermore, we show
that a model with increased grain growth at certain radii, as expected at a
snowline, can reproduce the dust rings in HD163296 equally well without the
need for companions. This scenario can explain both younger and older disks
with observed gaps, as gaps have been seen in systems as young <1 Myr. While
the origin of the rings in HD163296 remains unclear, these modeling results
demonstrate that care has to be taken when interpreting CO emission in
protoplanetary disk observations.

corrective actions, to stabilise a core keypoint-based gait. The feedback
controller is experimentally effective, yet free of any physical model of the

portable between robots, and was specifically also designed to target lower

resources. The IMU data is used to estimate the yaw-independent tilt
orientation of the robot, expressed in the so-called tilt phase space, and is
the source of all feedback provided by the controller. Experimental validation

transport phenomena such as the quantum, spin and anomalous Hall effect (AHE).
In contrast to the quantum Hall effect - which is characterized by a
topological invariant and robust against perturbations - the AHE depends on the
Berry curvature of occupied bands at the Fermi level and is therefore highly
sensitive to subtle changes in the band structure. A unique platform for its
manipulation is provided by transition metal oxide heterostructures, where
engineering of emergent electrodynamics becomes possible at atomically sharp
interfaces. We demonstrate that the Berry curvature and its corresponding
vector potential can be manipulated by interface engineering of the correlated
itinerant ferromagnet SrRuO$_3$ (SRO). Measurements of the AHE reveal the
presence of two interface-tunable spin-polarized conduction channels. Using
theoretical calculations, we show that the tunability of the AHE at SRO
interfaces arises from the competition between two topologically non-trivial
bands. Our results demonstrate how reconstructions at oxide interfaces can be
used to control emergent electrodynamics on a nanometer-scale, opening new
routes towards spintronics and topological electronics.

constant magnetic field $b$ which generates a magnetic flux $\varphi$ per unit
area, then any spectral island $\sigma_b$ consisting of $M$ infinitely
degenerate Landau levels carries an integrated density of states
$\mathcal{I}_b=M \varphi$. Wannier later discovered a similar Diophantine
relation expressing the integrated density of states of a gapped group of bands
of the Hofstadter Hamiltonian as a linear function of the magnetic field flux
with integer slope.
  We extend this result to a gap labelling theorem for any $2d$ Bloch-Landau
operator $H_b$ which also has a bounded $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic electric
potential. Assume that $H_b$ has a spectral island $\sigma_b$ which remains
isolated from the rest of the spectrum as long as $\varphi$ lies in a compact
interval $[\varphi_1,\varphi_2]$. Then $\mathcal{I}_b=c_0+c_1\varphi$ on such
intervals, where the constant $c_0\in \mathbb{Q}$ while $c_1\in \mathbb{Z}$.
The integer $c_1$ is the Chern marker of the spectral projection onto the
spectral island $\sigma_b$. This result also implies that the Fermi projection
on $\sigma_b$, albeit continuous in $b$ in the strong topology, is nowhere
continuous in the norm topology if either $c_1\ne0$ or $c_1=0$ and $\varphi$ is
rational.
  Our proofs, otherwise elementary, do not use non-commutative geometry but are
based on gauge covariant magnetic perturbation theory which we briefly review
for the sake of the reader. Moreover, our method allows us to extend the
analysis to certain non-covariant systems having slowly varying magnetic

after outburst II suggests that the crust is close to returning to thermal
equilibrium with the core. We model the crust heating and cooling for both its
outbursts collectively to understand the effect of parameters that may change
for every outburst (e.g., the average accretion rate, the length of outburst,
the envelope composition of the neutron star at the end of the outburst) and
those which can be assumed to remain the same during these two outbursts (e.g.,
the neutron star mass, its radius). Our modelling indicates that all parameters
were consistent between the two outbursts with no need for any significant
changes. In particular, the strength and the depth of the shallow heating
mechanism at work (in the crust) were inferred to be the same during both
outbursts, contrary to what has been found when modelling the cooling curves

pass through the gap. As a consequence, the density of the dust grains can
increase up to the same level of the density of the gas at the outer edge. The
feedback on the gas from the drifting dust grains is not negligible, in such a
dusty region. We carried out two-dimensional two-fluid (gas and dust)
hydrodynamic simulations. We found that when the radial flow of the dust grains
across the gap is halted, a broad ring of the dust grains can be formed because
of the dust feedback and the diffusion of the dust grains. The minimum mass of
the planet to form the broad dust ring is consistent with the pebble-isolation
mass, in the parameter range of our simulations. The broad ring of the dust

namely that the electronic thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) is proportional to
the product of the absolute temperature ($T$) and the electrical conductivity

Lorenz number $L_0$, being a materials-independent universal constant in all
systems obeying the Fermi liquid (FL) paradigm. It has been often stated that
the validity (invalidity) of the WF law is the hallmark of an FL
(non-Fermi-liquid (NFL)). We consider, both in two (2D) and three (3D)
dimensions, a system of conduction electrons at a finite temperature $T$
coupled to a bath of acoustic phonons and quenched impurities, ignoring effects
of electron-electron interactions. We find that the WF law is violated
arbitrarily strongly with the effective Lorenz number vanishing at low
temperatures as long as phonon scattering is stronger than impurity scattering.
This happens both in 2D and in 3D for $T<T_{BG}$, where $T_{BG}$ is the
Bloch-Gr\""uneisen temperature of the system. In the absence of phonon
scattering (or equivalently, when impurity scattering is much stronger than the
phonon scattering), however, the WF law is restored at low temperatures even if
the impurity scattering is mostly small angle forward scattering. Thus,
strictly at $T=0$ the WF law is always valid in a FL in the presence of
infinitesimal impurity scattering. For strong phonon scattering, the WF law is
restored for $T> T_{BG}$ (or the Debye temperature $T_D$, whichever is lower)
as in usual metals. At very high temperatures, thermal smearing of the Fermi
surface causes the effective Lorenz number to go below $L_0$ manifesting a
quantitative deviation from the WF law. Our work establishes definitively that
the uncritical association of an NFL behavior with the failure of the WF law is
incorrect.

include the effects of baryons on the dark matter distribution 2) the baryon
particles can be used to make mock observables that can be compared directly
with observations. As is well known, SIDM haloes are systematically less dense
in their centres, and rounder, than CDM haloes. Here we find that that these
changes are not reflected in the distribution of gas or stars within galaxy
clusters, or in their X-ray luminosities. However, gravitational lensing
observables can discriminate between DM models, and we present a menu of tests
that future surveys could use to measure the SIDM interaction strength. We
ray-trace our simulated galaxy clusters to produce strong lensing maps.
Including baryons boosts the lensing strength of clusters that produce no
critical curves in SIDM-only simulations. Comparing the Einstein radii of our

either it formed in relative isolation or it was ejected dynamically from the

Hubble Space Telescope astrometry. We derive a projected velocity relative to
the cluster of $38 \pm 17 \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$ (1$\sigma$ confidence
interval). Although the error bars are substantial, two independent measures
suggest that VFTS682 is a runaway ejected from the central cluster. This
hypothesis is further supported by a variety of circumstantial clues. The
central cluster is known to harbor other stars more massive than 150 $M_\odot$
of similar spectral type and recent astrometric studies on VFTS16 and VFTS72
provide direct evidence that the cluster can eject some of its most massive

covering the whole thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB)
evolution, and representing a significant update with respect to previous
works. The main improvement is the inclusion of detailed atomic and molecular
opacities, consistent with the models chemical mixture, that makes the present
set of models the first to systematically account for variability in C-stars.
We examine periods and growth rates in the models, and find that, while the
fundamental mode is affected by the structure of the envelope, overtones are
less sensitive to the interior and largely determined by the global properties.
In the models, the frequency of the overtone with the largest degree of
excitation is found to scale with the acoustic cut-off frequency at the stellar
surface, a behaviour similar to that observed for the frequency of maximum
oscillation power for solar-like oscillations in less evolved red giants. This
allows us to provide a simple analytic prescription to predict the most-likely
dominant mode as a function of stellar parameters. Best-fit relations for
periods are also provided. By applying results of pulsation models to
evolutionary tracks, we present a general picture of the evolution of
long-period variability during the TP-AGB, that we find consistent with
observations. Models are made public through a dedicated web interface.

  Data Rate and Channel Hardening Effects","to appear, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The concept of a large intelligent surface (LIS) has recently emerged as a
promising wireless communication paradigm that can exploit the entire surface
of man-made structures for transmitting and receiving information. An LIS is
expected to go beyond massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system,
insofar as the desired channel can be modeled as a perfect line-of-sight. To
understand the fundamental performance benefits, it is imperative to analyze
its achievable data rate, under practical LIS environments and limitations. In
this paper, an asymptotic analysis of the uplink data rate in an LIS-based
large antenna-array system is presented. In particular, the asymptotic LIS rate
is derived in a practical wireless environment where the estimated channel on
LIS is subject to estimation errors and interference channels are spatially
correlated Rician fading channels. Moreover, the occurrence of the channel
hardening effect is analyzed and the performance bound is asymptotically
derived for the considered LIS system. The analytical asymptotic results are
then shown to be in close agreement with the exact mutual information as the
numbers of antennas and devices increases without bounds. Moreover, the derived
ergodic rates show that noise and interference from estimation errors and the
non-line-of-sight path become negligible as the number of antennas increases.
Simulation results show that an LIS can achieve a performance that is
comparable to conventional massive MIMO with improved reliability and a
significantly reduced area for antenna deployment.

functions of the sources with respect to the microphones, the PSD of late

ground-state reaction rates of $2.19 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at 150 K

with very good accuracy from thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics
simulations. The position and lineshape of this peak, centered at around 2600
cm$^{-1}$ and spanning 750 cm$^{-1}$, stems from a combination of very strong
H-bonds, the coupling to low-frequency modes, and the access to $cis$-like
isomeric conformations, which cannot be appropriately captured with
classical-nuclei dynamics. These results verify the appropriateness of our
general theoretical approach and provide a framework for a deeper physical
understanding of hydrogen transfer dynamics in complex systems.

forms is a problem of current interest. Both mock and quantum modular forms
exhibit modular-like transformation properties under suitable subgroups of
$\rm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$, up to nontrivial error terms; however, their domains
(the upper half-plane $\mathbb H$, and the rationals $\mathbb Q$, respectively)
are notably different. Quantum modular forms, originally defined by Zagier in
2010, have also been shown to be related to the diverse areas of colored Jones
polynomials, meromorphic Jacobi forms, partial theta functions, vertex
algebras, and more.
  In this paper we study the $(n+1)$-variable combinatorial rank generating
function $R_n(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n;q)$ for $n$-marked Durfee symbols. These are
$n+1$ dimensional multisums for $n>1$, and specialize to the ordinary
two-variable partition rank generating function when $n=1$. The mock modular
properties of $R_n$ when viewed as a function of $\tau\in\mathbb H$, with
$q=e^{2\pi i \tau}$, for various $n$ and fixed parameters $x_1, x_2, \cdots,
x_n$, have been studied in a series of papers. Namely, by Bringmann and Ono
when $n=1$ and $x_1$ a root of unity; by Bringmann when $n=2$ and $x_1=x_2=1$;
by Bringmann, Garvan, and Mahlburg for $n\geq 2$ and $x_1=x_2=\dots=x_n=1$; and
by the first and third authors for $n\geq 2$ and the $x_j$ suitable roots of
unity ($1\leq j \leq n$).
  The quantum modular properties of $R_1$ readily follow from existing results.
Here, we focus our attention on the case $n\geq 2$, and prove for any $n\geq 2$
that the combinatorial generating function $R_n$ is a quantum modular form when
viewed as a function of $x \in \mathbb Q$, where $q=e^{2\pi i x}$, and the
$x_j$ are suitable distinct roots of unity.

block in many fields ranging from telecommunication to optical analogue
computation and machine learning. For many of these applications, key
requirements are robustness to fabrication inaccuracies and reconfigurability.
Current designs of custom-tailored photonic devices or coherent photonic
circuits only partially satisfy these needs. Here, we propose a way to perform
linear operations by using complex optical media such as multimode fibers or
thin scattering layers as a computational platform driven by wavefront shaping.
Given a large random transmission matrix (TM) representing light propagation in
such a medium, we can extract a desired smaller linear operator by finding
suitable input and output projectors. We discuss fundamental upper bounds on
the size of the linear transformations our approach can achieve and provide an
experimental demonstration. For the latter, first we retrieve the complex
medium's TM with a non-interferometric phase retrieval method. Then, we take
advantage of the large number of degrees of freedom to find input wavefronts
using a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) that cause the system, composed of the
SLM and the complex medium, to act as a desired complex-valued linear operator
on the optical field. We experimentally build several $16\times16$
complex-valued operators, and are able to switch from one to another at will.
Our technique offers the prospect of reconfigurable, robust and
easy-to-fabricate linear optical analogue computation units.

  Algorithms",,,"10.1007/978-3-030-32047-8_16",,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Clustering non-Euclidean data is difficult, and one of the most used
algorithms besides hierarchical clustering is the popular algorithm
Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), also simply referred to as k-medoids. In
Euclidean geometry the mean-as used in k-means-is a good estimator for the
cluster center, but this does not hold for arbitrary dissimilarities. PAM uses
the medoid instead, the object with the smallest dissimilarity to all others in
the cluster. This notion of centrality can be used with any (dis-)similarity,
and thus is of high relevance to many domains such as biology that require the
use of Jaccard, Gower, or more complex distances.
  A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose modifications to
the PAM algorithm to achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the second SWAP phase of
the algorithm, but will still find the same results as the original PAM
algorithm. If we slightly relax the choice of swaps performed (at comparable
quality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by performing up to k swaps
in each iteration. With the substantially faster SWAP, we can now also explore
alternative strategies for choosing the initial medoids. We also show how the
CLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from these modifications. It can easily be
combined with earlier approaches to use PAM and CLARA on big data (some of
which use PAM as a subroutine, hence can immediately benefit from these
improvements), where the performance with high k becomes increasingly
important.
  In experiments on real data with k=100, we observed a 200-fold speedup
compared to the original PAM SWAP algorithm, making PAM applicable to larger
data sets as long as we can afford to compute a distance matrix, and in
particular to higher k (at k=2, the new SWAP was only 1.5 times faster, as the
speedup is expected to increase with k).

behavior, such as templating 1-D nanomaterial assembly via pathways that are

between diamondoids to explore why molecules with high structural rigidity
exhibit these novel assembly pathways. The rigid nature of diamondoids
significantly lowers configurational entropy, and we hypothesize that this
influences molecular interaction forces. To test this concept, we calculated
the distance-dependent impact of entropy on assembly using molecular dynamics
simulations. To isolate pairwise entropic and enthalpic contributions to
assembly, we considered pairs of molecules in a thermal bath, fixed at set
intermolecular separations but otherwise allowed to freely move. By comparing
diamondoids to linear alkanes, we draw out the impact of rigidity on the
entropy and enthalpy of pairwise interactions. We find that linear alkanes
actually exhibit stronger van der Waals interactions than diamondoids at
contact, because the bulky structure of diamondoids induces larger net atomic
separations. Yet, we also find that diamondoids pay lower entropic penalties
when assembling into contact pairs. Thus, the cage-like shape of diamondoids
introduces an enthalpic penalty at contact, but the penalty is counterbalanced
by entropic effects. Investigating the distance dependence of entropic forces
provides a mechanism to explore how rigidity influences molecular assembly. Our
results show that low entropic penalties paid by diamondoids can explain the
effectiveness of diamondoids in templating nanomaterial assembly. Hence, tuning
molecular rigidity can be an effective strategy for controlling the assembly of
functional materials, such as biomimetic surfaces and nanoscale materials.

single-photon emitters with a lithium niobate photonic chip. The emitters are
composed of InAs quantum dots embedded in an InP nanobeam, which we transfer to
a lithium niobate waveguide with nanoscale accuracy using a pick-and place
approach. An adiabatic taper transfers single photons emitted into the nanobeam
to the lithium niobate waveguide with high efficiency. We verify the single
photon nature of the emission using photon correlation measurements performed
with an on-chip beamsplitter. Our results demonstrate an important step toward
fast, reconfigurable quantum photonic circuits for quantum information
processing.

became fainter, slower, less frequent, and less energetic, before the emission
transitioned (over 1--2 days) to being dominated by a compact jet, as the
outburst decayed toward quiescence. While the broad-band spectrum of this
compact jet showed very little evolution throughout the outburst decay (with
the optically thick to thin synchrotron jet spectral break residing in the

contain false or inaccurate dependencies. To overcome this problem, we propose
a system, called ProPatrol, which leverages the open compartmentalized design
in families of enterprise applications used in security-sensitive contexts
(e.g., browser, chat client, email client). To achieve its goal, ProPatrol
infers a model for an application's high-level tasks as input-processing
compartments using purely the audit log events generated by that application.
The main benefit of this approach is that it does not rely on source code or
binary instrumentation, but only on a preliminary and general knowledge of an
application's architecture to bootstrap the analysis. Our experiments with
enterprise-level attacks demonstrate that ProPatrol significantly cuts down the
forensic investigation effort and quickly pinpoints the root- cause of attacks.
ProPatrol incurs less than 2% runtime overhead on a commodity operating system.

atmosphere. The infrared channels of the instrument operate by combining an
echelle grating spectrometer with an Acousto-Optical Tunable Filter (AOTF).
Using in-flight data, we characterized the instrument performance and
parameterized its calibration. In particular: an accurate frequency calibration
was achieved, together with its variability due to thermal effects on the
grating. The AOTF properties and transfer function were also quantified, and we
developed and tested a realistic method to compute the spectral continuum
transmitted through the coupled grating + AOTF system. The calibration results
enabled unprecedented insights into the important problem of the sensitivity of
NOMAD to methane abundances in the atmosphere. We also deeply characterized its
performance under realistic conditions of varying aerosol abundances, diverse
albedos and changing illumination conditions as foreseen over the nominal
mission. The results show that, in low aerosol conditions, NOMAD single
spectrum, 1-sigma sensitivity to CH4 is around 0.33 ppbv at 20 km of altitude
when performing solar occultations, and better than 1 ppbv below 30 km. In
dusty conditions, we show that the sensitivity drops to 0 below 10 km. In Nadir

of CH4 with a sensitivity around 5 ppbv over most of planet's surface with

the network can be improved by 1) constrained stochasticity and 2) global
aggregation of temporal information in the latent space. First, drawing from
analytical learning theory, we theoretically show that a stochastic latent
space will lead to an improved generalization ability. Second, we consider an
LSTM encoder-decoder architecture that compresses a global latent vector from
all last-layer units in the LSTM encoder. This model is compared with
alternative LSTM encoder-decoder architectures, each in deterministic and
stochastic versions. The results demonstrate that the generalization ability of
an inverse reconstruction network can be improved by constrained stochasticity

developed to automatically remove the haze from images. Typically, the goal of
image dehazing is to produce clearer images from which human vision can better
identify the object and structural details present in the images. When the
ground-truth haze-free image is available for a hazy image, quantitative
evaluation of image dehazing is usually based on objective metrics, such as
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM). However, in
many applications, large-scale images are collected not for visual examination
by human. Instead, they are used for many high-level vision tasks, such as
automatic classification, recognition and categorization. One fundamental
problem here is whether various dehazing methods can produce clearer images

we empirically study this problem in the important task of image classification

  Privacy, in an information theoretic sense, is then achieved by encrypting

  Several PIR schemes in the literature, in addition to novel ones constructed

PIR and data security against eavesdropping. However, their download rate is
not optimal, i.e., they do not achieve the PIR capacity. Our main contribution
is two transformations of one-shot schemes, which we call refining and lifting.
We show that refining and lifting one-shot schemes gives capacity-achieving
schemes for the cases when the PIR capacity is known. In the other cases, when
the PIR capacity is still unknown, refining and lifting one-shot schemes gives

four-loop perturbation theory in two cubic interaction coupling constants near

find infrared-stable fixed point with two relevant quadratic operators for $N$
within the conformal windows $1<N<2.653$ and $2.999<N<4$, and compute critical
exponents at this fixed point to the order $\epsilon^4$. Taking the four-loop
beta-functions at their face value we determine the higher-order corrections to
the edges of the above conformal windows at finite $\epsilon$, to find both
intervals to shrink to zero above $\epsilon\approx 0.15$. The disappearance of
the conformal windows with the increase of $\epsilon$ is due to the collision
of the Wilson-Fisher $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ infrared fixed point with the
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ mixed-stable fixed point that appears at two and persists at
higher loops. The latter may be understood as a Banks-Zaks type fixed point
that becomes weakly coupled near the right edge of either conformal window. The
consequences and issues raised by such an evolution of the flow with dimension
are discussed. It is also shown both within the perturbation theory and exactly
that the tensor representation at $N=3$ and right at the

  These notes will reveal to these students that there is a precise and
rigorous way, and this also means a more useful and reliable way, to define
these objects and the operations performed upon them. This can be done without
any prior knowledge of functional analysis or of Lebesgue integration. Readers
of these notes are assumed to only have studied basic courses in linear
algebra, and calculus of functions of one and two variables, and an
introductory course about the Fourier transform of functions of one variable.
  Most of the results and proofs presented here are in the setting of the space
of tempered distributions introduced by Laurent Schwartz. But there are also
some very brief mentions of other approaches to distributions or generalized
functions.

representations during deep neural network (DNN) training, aiming to demystify
the compression aspect of the information bottleneck theory. The theory
suggests that DNN training comprises a rapid fitting phase followed by a slower
compression phase, in which the mutual information $I(X;T)$ between the input
$X$ and internal representations $T$ decreases. Several papers observe
compression of estimated mutual information on different DNN models, but the
true $I(X;T)$ over these networks is provably either constant (discrete $X$) or
infinite (continuous $X$). This work explains the discrepancy between theory
and experiments, and clarifies what was actually measured by these past works.
To this end, we introduce an auxiliary (noisy) DNN framework for which $I(X;T)$
is a meaningful quantity that depends on the network's parameters. This noisy
framework is shown to be a good proxy for the original (deterministic) DNN both
in terms of performance and the learned representations. We then develop a
rigorous estimator for $I(X;T)$ in noisy DNNs and observe compression in
various models. By relating $I(X;T)$ in the noisy DNN to an
information-theoretic communication problem, we show that compression is driven
by the progressive clustering of hidden representations of inputs from the same
class. Several methods to directly monitor clustering of hidden
representations, both in noisy and deterministic DNNs, are used to show that
meaningful clusters form in the $T$ space. Finally, we return to the estimator
of $I(X;T)$ employed in past works, and demonstrate that while it fails to
capture the true (vacuous) mutual information, it does serve as a measure for
clustering. This clarifies the past observations of compression and isolates
the geometric clustering of hidden representations as the true phenomenon of
interest.

fitted their UV-to-IR spectral energy distributions (SED) with sets of
theoretical models using CIGALE. We perform a comparison of the integrated
galaxy parameters derived from multi-band SED fitting with those obtained from
modelling the Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectra and show the clear advantage of
using the SED-derived star formation rates (SFR). A detailed analysis of
galaxies in the SFR/Mstar plane as a function of their properties reveals that
quenching of star formation is caused by a combination of gas deficiency and
the inefficiency of the existing gas to form new stars. Exploring the plausible
mechanisms that could produce this effect, we find a strong correlation with
galaxy morphology and the build-up of central bulge. On the other hand, the
presence of AGN and/or a stellar bar, as well as the local environment have
only temporal effects on the current star formation, a result also consistent
with their model-derived star formation histories.

surfaces have been based by analogy to turbulent flow within pipes having rough
interiors. Failure of this analogy at low Reynolds number ($Re$) flow rates has
frustrated attempts to create a comprehensive theory.
  By introducing the concept of self-similar roughness, this investigation
derives formulas for a plate's skin-friction coefficient and forced convection
given its characteristic length, root-mean-squared (RMS) height-of-roughness,
isotropic spatial period, and the fluid's Prandtl number ($Pr$). Compared with
this novel theory, the RMS relative error (RMSRE) of friction measurements from
Pimenta, Moffat, and Kays (1975) is 4.5%. RMSRE is 3.3% and 4.4% from
Bergstrom, Akinlade, and Tachie (2005) wire meshes and perforated plates. RMSRE
is 1.7% from this investigation's convection experiments.
  Building on its analysis of self-similar roughness, this investigation
derives formulas for a smooth plate's turbulent drag coefficient and forced
convection given $Re>0$ and $Pr>0$. Its friction formula matches measurements
spanning $10^5\le Re\le10^9$ by Smith and Walker (1959) and Spalding and Chi
(1964) with unprecedented 0.75% RMSRE. Four friction data-sets from
\v{Z}ukauskas and \v{S}lan\v{c}iauskas (1987) at $0.7<Pr<55$ have RMSRE values
between 2.5% and 5.2%.
  The laminar periodic oscillations found by Tuck and Kouzoubov (1995) resemble
flow along a small periodic surface roughness. This investigation develops that
correspondence into comprehensive formulas for smooth skin-friction and
convection given $Pr>0$, $Re>0$, and critical Reynolds number $Re_c\ge600$. Its
friction formula has 2.8% RMSRE from measurements by Gebers (1920). And 15
convection data-sets from \v{Z}ukauskas and \v{S}lan\v{c}iauskas spanning
$0.7<Pr<317$ have RMSRE values between 1.0% and 6.7%.

exploits the fact that the CASTOR calorimeter at $-6.6$ $<$ $\eta$ $<$ $-5.2$
is effectively present on both sides of the colliding system because of a
switch in the proton-going and lead-going beam directions. This wide acceptance
enables the study of correlations between well-separated angular regions and
makes the measurement a particularly powerful test of event generators. For
minimum bias pPb collisions the maximum value of d$E_\mathrm{T}/$d$\eta$ is 22
GeV, which implies an $E_\mathrm{T}$ per participant nucleon pair comparable to
that of peripheral PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} =$ 2.76 TeV. The
increase of d$E_\mathrm{T}/$d$\eta$ with centrality is much stronger for the
lead-going side than for the proton-going side. The $\eta$ dependence of
d$E_\mathrm{T}/$d$\eta$ is sensitive to the $\eta$ range in which the

control policies to achieve complex tasks such as locomotion. However, a policy
trained in simulation usually does not transfer directly to the real hardware

domain randomization is a promising approach, but it usually assumes that the
target environment is close to the distribution of the training environments,
thus relying heavily on accurate system identification. In this paper, we
present a different approach that leverages domain randomization for
transferring control policies to unknown environments. The key idea that,
instead of learning a single policy in the simulation, we simultaneously learn
a family of policies that exhibit different behaviors. When tested in the
target environment, we directly search for the best policy in the family based

have been established, and those only for the high SNR regime. We show here
that EM converges for mixed linear regression with two components (it is known
that it may fail to converge for three or more), and moreover that this
convergence holds for random initialization. Our analysis reveals that EM
exhibits very different behavior in Mixed Linear Regression from its behavior
in Gaussian Mixture Models, and hence our proofs require the development of
several new ideas.

better understanding of the physics of many-particle systems, from quarks and
atomic nuclei, to molecules and galaxies. In atomic nuclei, exact and dominant
symmetries such as rotational invariance, parity, and charge independence have
been clearly established. However, even when these symmetries are taken into
account, the structure of nuclei remains illusive and only partially
understood, with no additional symmetries immediately evident from the
underlying nucleon-nucleon interaction. Here, we show through ab initio
large-scale nuclear structure calculations that the special nature of the
strong nuclear force determines additional highly regular patterns in nuclei
that can be tied to an emergent approximate symmetry. We find that this
symmetry is remarkably ubiquitous, regardless of its particular strong
interaction heritage, and mathematically tracks with a symplectic group.
Specifically, we show for light to intermediate-mass nuclei that the structure
of a nucleus, along with its low-energy excitations, respects symplectic
symmetry at about 70-80% level, unveiling the predominance of only a few
equilibrium shapes, deformed or not, with associated vibrations and rotations.
This establishes the symplectic symmetry as a remarkably good symmetry of the
strong nuclear force, in the low-energy regime. This may have important
implications to studies in astrophysics and neutrino physics that rely on
nuclear structure information, especially where experimental measurements are
incomplete or not available. A very important practical advantage is that this
new symmetry can be utilized to dramatically reduce computational resources
required in ab initio large-scale nuclear structure modeling. This, in turn,
can be used to pioneer predictions, e.g., for short-lived isotopes along
various nucleosynthesis pathways.

playoff system, robotics teams have longed to appropriately quantify the
strengths of their designed robots. The FRC includes a playground draft-like
phase (alliance selection), arguably the most game-changing part of the
competition, in which the top-8 robotics teams in a tournament based on the
FRC's ranking system assess potential alliance members for the opportunity of
partnering in a playoff stage. In such a three-versus-three competition,
several measures and models have been used to characterize actual or relative
robot strengths. However, existing models are found to have poor predictive
performance due to their imprecise estimates of robot strengths caused by a
small ratio of the number of observations to the number of robots. A more
general regression model with latent clusters of robot strengths is, thus,
proposed to enhance their predictive capacities. Two effective estimation
procedures are further developed to simultaneously estimate the number of
clusters, clusters of robots, and robot strengths. Meanwhile, some measures are
used to assess the predictive ability of competing models, the agreement
between published FRC measures of strength and model-based robot strengths of
all, playoff, and FRC top-8 robots, and the agreement between FRC top-8 robots
and model-based top robots. Moreover, the stability of estimated robot
strengths and accuracies is investigated to determine whether the scheduled
matches are excessive or insufficient. In the analysis of qualification data
from the 2018 FRC Houston and Detroit championships, the predictive ability of
our model is also shown to be significantly better than those of existing
models. Teams who adopt the new model can now appropriately rank their
preferences for playoff alliance partners with greater predictive capability
than before.

a strong coupling between the vehicle's planning and its predictions of other

the safety and viability of autonomous driving technology. Unfortunately,
dynamic games are too computationally demanding to meet the real-time
constraints of autonomous driving in its continuous state and action space. In
this paper, we introduce a novel game-theoretic trajectory planning algorithm
for autonomous driving, that enables real-time performance by hierarchically
decomposing the underlying dynamic game into a long-horizon ""strategic"" game
with simplified dynamics and full information structure, and a short-horizon
""tactical"" game with full dynamics and a simplified information structure. The
value of the strategic game is used to guide the tactical planning, implicitly
extending the planning horizon, pushing the local trajectory optimization
closer to global solutions, and, most importantly, quantitatively accounting
for the autonomous vehicle and the human driver's ability and incentives to
influence each other. In addition, our approach admits non-deterministic models
of human decision-making, rather than relying on perfectly rational

of the idea is illustrated via the two-mode $(N-1)-$bosonic Bose-Hubbard
Hamiltonian. In $H^{(before)}=H^{(BH)}(\varepsilon)$ we use the decreasing real
$\varepsilon^{(before)} \to 0$. In the hiddenly Hermitian continuation
$H^{(after)}=H^{(BH)}(\tilde{\varepsilon})$ the imaginary part of the purely
imaginary $\tilde{\varepsilon}^{(after)}$ grows. The smoothness of the
transition occurring at the interface $\varepsilon=\tilde{\varepsilon}=0$ is
then guaranteed by an {\it ad hoc\,} amendment of the inner product in Hilbert
space ""after"". The trivial Hilbert-space metric $\Theta^{(before)}=I$ must
match $\Theta^{(after)} \neq I$ smoothly. This is confirmed and illustrated by
the explicit constructions of a few $\Theta^{(after)}$s in closed form.

the clearance rate (CR) refers to the percentage of items that are sold over
the duration of the auction. This research is concerned with maximizing the CR
of reputation-aware (RA) auctions in centralized, participatory MCS systems.
Recent techniques in the literature had focused on several challenges including
untruthful bidding and malicious information that might be sent by the

tasks in such systems, even though it has a tangible impact on the satisfaction
of service demanders. Towards the goal of maximizing CR in MCS systems, we
propose two new formulations for the bidding procedure that is a part of the

methods and their impact on the user utility, under varying number of auctions,

methods through consistent and considerable increases (three times increase, in
some cases) in the CR compared to the state-of-the-art.

accelerated to high speeds by stellar radiation pressure. Further spectroscopic

compare captured views of real objects with the rendered views of their 3D CAD

show that sidestepping the issue of symmetry in this scenario during training
leads to poor performance at test time. We propose a model that reasons about
rotational symmetry during training by having access to only a small set of

quantum dot spin arrays containing as few as three quantum dots, each confining

learning complex data distributions on different types of data. In this paper,
we first show a straightforward extension of existing GAN algorithm is not
applicable to point clouds, because the constraint required for discriminators
is undefined for set data. We propose a two fold modification to GAN algorithm
for learning to generate point clouds (PC-GAN). First, we combine ideas from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling and implicit generative models by learning a
hierarchical and interpretable sampling process. A key component of our method
is that we train a posterior inference network for the hidden variables.
Second, instead of using only state-of-the-art Wasserstein GAN objective, we
propose a sandwiching objective, which results in a tighter Wasserstein
distance estimate than the commonly used dual form. Thereby, PC-GAN defines a
generic framework that can incorporate many existing GAN algorithms. We
validate our claims on ModelNet40 benchmark dataset. Using the distance between
generated point clouds and true meshes as metric, we find that PC-GAN trained
by the sandwiching objective achieves better results on test data than the
existing methods. Moreover, as a byproduct, PC- GAN learns versatile latent
representations of point clouds, which can achieve competitive performance with
other unsupervised learning algorithms on object recognition task. Lastly, we
also provide studies on generating unseen classes of objects and transforming
image to point cloud, which demonstrates the compelling generalization
capability and potentials of PC-GAN.

mathematical and physical fields to help understand the complex systems, and a
lot of problems including the minimal vertex-cover are deeply related to this

features of the Leaf-Removal cores, a method named Core Influence is proposed
to break the graphs into No-Leaf-Removal-Core ones, which takes advantages of
identifying some significant nodes by localized and greedy strategy. By
decomposing the minimal vertex-cover problem into the Leaf-Removal cores
breaking process and maximal matching of the remained graphs, it is proved that
any minimal vertex-covers of the whole graph can be located into these two
processes, of which the latter one is a P problem, and the best boundary is
achieved at the transition point. Compared with other node importance indices,
the Core Influence method could break down the Leaf-Removal cores much faster
and get the no-core graphs by removing fewer nodes from the graphs. Also, the
vertex-cover numbers resulted from this method are lower than existing node
importance measurements, and compared with the exact minimal vertex-cover
numbers, this method performs appropriate accuracy and stability at different
scales. This research provides a new localized greedy strategy to break the
hard Leaf-Removal Cores efficiently and heuristic methods could be constructed
to help understand some NP problems.

application of optical satellite imagery. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning based cloud detection method named multi-scale convolutional feature
fusion (MSCFF) for remote sensing images of different sensors. In the network
architecture of MSCFF, the symmetric encoder-decoder module, which provides
both local and global context by densifying feature maps with trainable
convolutional filter banks, is utilized to extract multi-scale and high-level
spatial features. The feature maps of multiple scales are then up-sampled and
concatenated, and a novel multi-scale feature fusion module is designed to fuse
the features of different scales for the output. The two output feature maps of
the network are cloud and cloud shadow maps, which are in turn fed to binary
classifiers outside the model to obtain the final cloud and cloud shadow mask.
The MSCFF method was validated on hundreds of globally distributed optical
satellite images, with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5 to 50 m, including
Landsat-5/7/8, Gaofen-1/2/4, Sentinel-2, Ziyuan-3, CBERS-04, Huanjing-1, and
collected high-resolution images exported from Google Earth. The experimental
results show that MSCFF achieves a higher accuracy than the traditional
rule-based cloud detection methods and the state-of-the-art deep learning
models, especially in bright surface covered areas. The effectiveness of MSCFF
means that it has great promise for the practical application of cloud
detection for multiple types of medium and high-resolution remote sensing
images. Our established global high-resolution cloud detection validation
dataset has been made available online.

independent set and the dimension of its null space equals the dimension of the
null space of $G$. Even more, we show that the fundamental spaces of $G$ are

Motivated by this we address the problem of provable safety of mixed traffic
consisting of both intelligent vehicles (IVs) as well as human-driven vehicles
(HVs). An important issue that arises is that such mixed systems may well have
lesser throughput than all human traffic systems if the automated vehicles are
expected to remain provably safe with respect to human traffic. This
necessitates the consideration of strategies such as platooning of automated
vehicles in order to increase the throughput. In this paper, we address the
design of provably safe systems consisting of a mix of automated and
human-driven vehicles including the use of platooning by automated vehicles.
  We design motion planing policies and coordination rules for participants in
this novel mixed system. HVs are considered as nearsighted and modeled with
relatively loose constraints, while IVs are considered as capable of following
much tighter constraints. HVs are expected to follow reasonable and simple
rules. IVs are designed to move under a model predictive control (MPC) based
motion plans and coordination protocols. Our contribution of this paper is in
showing how to integrate these two types of models safely into a mixed system.
System safety is proved in single lane scenarios, as well as in multi-lane
situations allowing lane changes.

bands turns out to be $\pi$-quantized in the presence of the chiral symmetry.
However, it does not always provide the correct corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
as one would have expected. We show that only the origin-independent part of
the Berry phase gives the correct bulk-boundary correspondence by its
$\pi$-quantized values. The resulting $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariant depends on the
choice of the 1D unit cell (defined by the nanoribbon termination) and is shown
to be connected to the symmetry eigenvalues of the wave functions at the center
and boundary of the Brillouin zone. Using the cove-edged GNRs as examples, we
demonstrate the existence of localized states at the end of some GNR segments
and at the junction between two GNRs based on a topological analysis. The
current results are expected to shed light on the design of electronic devices
based on GNRs as well as the understanding of the topological features in 1D
systems.

break with this concept by revealing the phenomenon of indefinite switching in
which the eventual steady state of a resonant bistable system is transformed
into a nontrivial function of signal pulse parameters for moderately intense
signal pulses. The essential nonlinearity of the indefinite switching allows
realization of well-protected cryptographic algorithms with a single bistable
element in contrast to software-assisted cryptographic protocols that require
thousands of logic gates. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate stream
deciphering of the word 'enigma' by means of an indefinitely switchable optical

assumption is that individuals' decisions to adopt a contagion are based on
their immediate neighbors. However, recent literature shows that some

as monophily. This motivates us to explore monophilic contagion, the case where
a contagion (e.g. a product, disease) is adopted by considering two-hop
neighbors instead of immediate neighbors (e.g. you ask your friend about the
new iPhone and she recommends you the opinion of one of her friends). We show
that the phenomenon called friendship paradox makes it easier for the
monophilic contagion to spread widely. We also consider the case where the
underlying network stochastically evolves in response to the state of the
contagion (e.g. depending on the severity of a flu virus, people restrict their
interactions with others to avoid getting infected) and show that the dynamics
of such a process can be approximated by a differential equation whose
trajectory satisfies an algebraic constraint restricting it to a manifold. Our
results shed light on how graph theoretic consequences affect contagions and,
provide simple deterministic models to approximate the collective dynamics of

that has seen lots of recent interest. It can reduce the number of test cases
needed by considering interactions between combinations of input parameters.
Empirical evidence shows that it effectively detects faults, in particular, for
highly configurable software systems. In real-world software testing, the input
variables may vary in how strongly they interact, variable strength
combinatorial interaction testing (VS-CIT) can exploit this for higher
effectiveness. The generation of variable strength test suites is a
non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard computational problem
\cite{BestounKamalFuzzy2017}. Research has shown that stochastic
population-based algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) can be
efficient compared to alternatives for VS-CIT problems. Nevertheless, they
require detailed control for the exploitation and exploration trade-off to
avoid premature convergence (i.e. being trapped in local optima) as well as to
enhance the solution diversity. Here, we present a new variant of PSO based on
Mamdani fuzzy inference system
\cite{Camastra2015,TSAKIRIDIS2017257,KHOSRAVANIAN2016280}, to permit adaptive
selection of its global and local search operations. We detail the design of
this combined algorithm and evaluate it through experiments on multiple
synthetic and benchmark problems. We conclude that fuzzy adaptive selection of
global and local search operations is, at least, feasible as it performs only
second-best to a discrete variant of PSO, called DPSO. Concerning obtaining the
best mean test suite size, the fuzzy adaptation even outperforms DPSO
occasionally. We discuss the reasons behind this performance and outline
relevant areas of future work.

which plays a non-trivial role in generating the structure of the neutrino mass

earlier studies of $3+1$ neutrino textures, we categorise the remaining ones

$A_4$ vacuum alignments, we use the latest $3+1$ neutrino oscillation data and

then $\{\Omega_{M}^k(U)\}_{U}$ is a sheaf of modules on the structure sheaf
$O_M$ of the $A$-manifold $M$ and the cohomology group $H^l(M,\Omega_{M}^k)$

get the cohomology group $H^l(M,\Omega_{M}^k)$ as an $A$-module. Furthermore,
we try to define the structure sheaf of a manifold that is locally a continuous

Directing attention to a finite family of $\mathbb C$-manifolds, we mentioned
the possibility that Dolbeault theorem holds for a continuous sum of $\mathbb

following. Let $n\in \mathbb N$. Then, does there exist a $\mathbb

M_{n-1}$ and $M_n$, $N$ can not be embedded in the direct product $M_1\times
M_2 \times \cdots \times M_{n-1} \times M_n$ as a $\mathbb C^n$-manifold ? So,

means of a medium without cosmological constant. In particular, the
Anton-Schmidt representation of matter describes the pressure of crystalline
solids under deformations imposed by isotropic stresses. The approach scheme is
related to the fact that the universe deforms under the action of the cosmic
expansion itself. Thus, we frame the dark energy term as a function of scalar
fields and obtain the corresponding dark energy potential $V(\varphi)$.

the question of how to choose the temperature spacings in an optimal way when

is that for an appropriately constructed regionally weight-preserved tempering

temperature spacings should behave as $\mathcal{O}\left(d^{-1/2}\right)$ and
this induces an optimal acceptance rate for temperature swap moves that lies in

Squares (ALS) methods applied to canonical tensor decomposition. While Nesterov
acceleration turns gradient descent into an optimal first-order method for
convex problems by adding a momentum term with a specific weight sequence, a
direct application of this method and weight sequence to ALS results in erratic
convergence behaviour. This is so because the tensor decomposition problem is
non-convex and ALS is accelerated instead of gradient descent. Instead, we
consider various restart mechanisms and suitable choices of momentum weights
that enable effective acceleration. Our extensive empirical results show that
the Nesterov-accelerated ALS methods with restart can be dramatically more
efficient than the stand-alone ALS or Nesterov accelerated gradient methods,
when problems are ill-conditioned or accurate solutions are desired. The
resulting methods perform competitively with or superior to existing
acceleration methods for ALS, including ALS acceleration by NCG, NGMRES, or
LBFGS, and additionally enjoy the benefit of being much easier to implement. We
also compare with Nesterov-type updates where the momentum weight is determined
by a line search, which are equivalent or closely related to existing line
search methods for ALS. On a large and ill-conditioned
71$\times$1000$\times$900 tensor consisting of readings from chemical sensors
to track hazardous gases, the restarted Nesterov-ALS method shows desirable
robustness properties and outperforms any of the existing methods by a large
factor. There is clear potential for extending our Nesterov-type acceleration
approach to accelerating other optimization algorithms than ALS applied to

them to migrate, to maintain tissue integrity, and to form complex
multicellular structures. This traction can be measured in a perturbation-free
manner with traction force microscopy (TFM). In TFM, traction is usually
calculated via the solution of a linear system, which is complicated by
undersampled input data, acquisition noise, and large condition numbers for
some methods. Therefore, standard TFM algorithms either employ data filtering
or regularization. However, these approaches require a manual selection of
filter- or regularization parameters and consequently exhibit a substantial
degree of subjectiveness. This shortcoming is particularly serious when cells
in different conditions are to be compared because optimal noise suppression
needs to be adapted for every situation, which invariably results in systematic
errors. Here, we systematically test the performance of new methods from
computer vision and Bayesian inference for solving the inverse problem in TFM.
We compare two classical schemes, L1- and L2-regularization, with three
previously untested schemes, namely Elastic Net regularization, Proximal
Gradient Lasso, and Proximal Gradient Elastic Net. Overall, we find that
Elastic Net regularization, which combines L1 and L2 regularization,
outperforms all other methods with regard to accuracy of traction
reconstruction. Next, we develop two methods, Bayesian L2 regularization and
Advanced Bayesian L2 regularization, for automatic, optimal L2 regularization.
Using artificial data and experimental data, we show that these methods enable
robust reconstruction of traction without requiring a difficult selection of
regularization parameters specifically for each data set. Thus, Bayesian
methods can mitigate the considerable uncertainty inherent in comparing
cellular traction forces.

large-scale poloidal and toroidal field as well as physics underlying the

magnetic field and process of energy release. The inductive action of fluid
motions pervading the solar interior is represented by a RLC circuit in which
the toroidal field built up through twisting of poloidal field, so called
$\omega$-effect, plays the role of a capacitor.
  Such a RLC circuit not only provides a self-sustained oscillatory system
avoiding Cowling's antidynamo theorem, but also site of rapid magnetic
reconnection which reproduces quadrupole magnetic field interpreting the
behavior of sunspots and moving of foot-point in solar activities. Moreover,

tunneling processes appear beyond expectation between the two nearest-neighbor
sites of the impurity with the spin unchanged and with impurity site population
negligible all the time, when the impurity potential is far off-resonant with
the driving field. Though tunneling behaviors of the two types seem to be the
same, they are believed to involve two distinct mechanisms: one is related to
spin-independent process, while the other is to spin-dependent tunneling
process. The two types of second-order processes can be identified by means of
resonant tunneling with or without spin-flipping by tuning the impurity
potential to be in resonance with the driving field. In the Floquet picture,
the second-order processes are manifested as subtle and fine avoided crossings
of quasienergy spectrums near the pseudocollapse region. These results are
confirmed analytically on the basis of effective three-site model and

the interdictor has incomplete initial information about the network while the
evader has complete knowledge of the network including its structure and arc
costs. In each decision epoch, the interdictor can block (for the duration of
the epoch) at most $k$ arcs known to him/her. By observing the evader's
actions, the interdictor learns about the network structure and costs and thus,
can adjust his/her actions in subsequent decision epochs. It is known from the
literature that if the evader is greedy (i.e., the shortest available path is
used in each decision epoch), then under some assumptions the greedy
interdiction policies that block $k$-most vital arcs in each epoch are
efficient and have a finite regret. In this paper, we consider the evader's
perspective and explore deterministic ""strategic"" evasion policies under the
assumption that the interdictor is greedy. We first study the theoretical
computational complexity of the evader's problem. Then we derive basic
constructive properties of optimal evasion policies for two decision epochs
when the interdictor has no initial information about the network structure.
These properties are then exploited for the design of a heuristic algorithm for
a strategic evader in a general setting with an arbitrary time horizon and any
initial information available to the interdictor. Our computational experiments
demonstrate that the proposed heuristic outperforms the greedy evasion policy
on several classes of synthetic network instances under either perfect or noisy
information feedback. Finally, some interesting insights from our theoretical
and computational results conclude the paper.

electrons in actinide metals (Th-Cf) is calculated with the framework of
density-functional theory (DFT) using linear response approach. The $U$ values
seldom rely on the exchange-correlation functional, spin-orbital coupling, and
magnetic states, but depend on the lattice volume and actinide element. Along
the actinide series, the Coulomb parameter $U$ of $\alpha$-phase first
decreases slowly, followed by a jump in the vicinity of Pu and then a
monotonous increase. For light actinides, the lattice volume has a sizeable
influence on $U$ while the localization of 5$f$ electrons is almost constant.
But for transplutonium metals, $U$ is almost independent of the lattice volume
but the electronic localization increases rapidly. The calculated lattice
parameters from DFT+$U$ with the Coulomb parameters as input are in better
agreement with the experimental values than those from DFT within local density
approximation or Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof approximation for solids (PBEsol). In
particular, the agreement between PBEsol+$U$ and experiment is remarkable. We
show that PBEsol+$U$ also well reproduce the experimental bulk moduli and the
transition from itinerancy to localization of 5$f$ electrons along the series.
Therefore it is concluded that DFT+$U$ with $U$ calculated from linear response

problem in computer vision. The typical methods usually employ the singular
value decomposition of the essential matrix to get multiple solutions of the
relative pose, from which the right solution is picked out by reconstructing
the three-dimension (3D) feature points and imposing the constraint of positive
depth. This paper revisits the two-view geometry problem and discovers that the
two-view imaging geometry is equivalently governed by a Pair of new Pose-Only
(PPO) constraints: the same-side constraint and the intersection constraint.
From the perspective of solving equation, the complete pose solutions of the
essential matrix are explicitly derived and we rigorously prove that the
orientation part of the pose can still be recovered in the case of pure
rotation. The PPO constraints are simplified and formulated in the form of
inequalities to directly identify the right pose solution with no need of 3D
reconstruction and the 3D reconstruction can be analytically achieved from the
identified right pose. Furthermore, the intersection inequality also enables a
robust criterion for pure rotation identification. Experiment results validate
the correctness of analyses and the robustness of the derived pose

and guarantee that a command can be learned in at most $O(n)$ message delays,
where $n$ is the number of proposers. Later on, Xiong et al in [Xiong et al.
DISC, 2018] give a lattice agreement protocol which improves the $O(n)$
guarantee to be $O(f)$. However, neither protocols is practical for building a
linearizable RSM. Thus, in the second part of the paper, we first give an
improved protocol based on the one proposed by Xiong et al. Then, we implement
a simple linearizable RSM using the our improved protocol and compare our
implementation with an open source Java implementation of Paxos. Results show
that better performance can be obtained by using lattice agreement based
protocols to implement a linearizable RSM compared to traditional consensus
based protocols.

distribution networks (ADNs) are largely influenced by uncertainties. The
uncertainties of DERs are complicated, containing spatial and temporal
correlation, which makes it challenging to design proper control schemes,
especially when there exist temporal-correlated units such as energy units
(EUs). This paper provides an Ito process model to describe the characteristics
of stochastic resources and EUs in a unified way, which makes it easy to
evaluate the impacts of stochastic resources on temporal-correlated units.
Based the moment form of the Ito process model, a moment optimization (MO)
approach is provided to transform the stochastic control (SC) problem into an
optimization problem with respect to the first-order and second-order moments
of the system variables. The scale of MO is comparable to that of the
corresponding deterministic control problem, which means that the computational
efficiency of MO is much smaller than that of traditional approaches. Case
studies also show that the proposed approach outperforms existing approaches in
both the performance and computational efficiency, which means that the
proposed approach has attractive potential for use in large-scale applications.

dislocation. The model is a periodic Schrodinger operator on $\mathbb{R}$,
perturbed by an adiabatic dislocation of amplitude $\delta\ll 1$. If the
periodic background admits a Dirac point $-$ a linear crossing of dispersion
curves $-$ then the dislocated operator acquires a gap in its essential
spectrum. For this model (and its 2-dimensional honeycomb analog) Fefferman,
Lee-Thorp and Weinstein constructed in previous work defect modes with energies
within the gap. The bifurcation of defect modes is associated with the discrete
eigenmodes of an effective Dirac operator.
  We improve upon this result: we show that all the defect modes of the
dislocated operator arise from the eigenmodes of the Dirac operator. As a
byproduct, we derive full expansions of the eigenpairs in powers of $\delta$.
The self-contained proof relies on (a) resolvent estimates for the bulk
operators; (b) scattering theory for highly oscillatory potentials developed by

topological stability of certain defect states, particularly the bulk-edge

this way, the original problem is transformed into a classical integer-order
optimal control problem. The main challenge, which we faced in this step, is to
derive the left and right fractional differentiation matrices. In this respect,
novel techniques for derivation of these matrices are presented. In the second

indeed occurring during such a pause. We demonstrate that upon pausing the
system in a narrow region shortly after the minimum gap, the probability of

increased over an order of magnitude. We relate this effect to relaxation (i.e.
thermalization) after diabatic and thermal excitations that occur in the region
near to the minimum gap. For a set of large-scale problems of up to 500 qubits,
we demonstrate that the distribution returned from the annealer very closely
matches a (classical) Boltzmann distribution of the problem Hamiltonian, albeit
one with a temperature at least 1.5 times higher than the (effective)
temperature of the annealer. Moreover, we show that larger problems are more

mobile blind device can potentially utilize, as GPS-like reference nodes,
either in-range location-aware compatible mobile devices or preinstalled
low-cost infrastructure-less location-aware beacon nodes. The proposed approach
is model-based and calibration-free that uses the received signal strength to
periodically and collaboratively measure and update the radio frequency
characteristics of the operating environment to estimate the distances to the
reference nodes. Trilateration is then used by the blind device to identify its
own location, similar to that used in the GPS-based system. Simulation and
empirical testing ascertained that the proposed approach can potentially be the
core of future indoor and GPS-obstructed environments.

If the dynamical
fields and their action have a periodicity, the space of wave functions should
be algebraically extended `a la Galois, so that it may be consistent with the
periodicity. This was pointed out by Y. Nambu three decades ago. Having chosen
quantum mechanics (one dimensional field theory), this paper shows that a
different Galois extension gives a different quantization scheme. A new scheme
of quantization appears when the invariance under Galois group is imposed as a
physical state condition. Then, the normalization condition appears as a sum
over the product of more than three wave functions, each of which is given for
a different root adjoined by the field extension.

productive performance. The challenge is how to express an irregular
computation and its optimizations in a regular way.
  A sparse matrix has (non-zero) values and a structure. In this paper, we
propose to classify the implementations of a computation on a sparse matrix
into two categories: (1) structure-driven, or top-down, approach, which
traverses the structure with given row and column indices and locates the
corresponding values, and (2) values-driven, or bottom-up, approach, which
loads and processes the values in parallel streams, and decodes the structure
for the values' corresponding row and column indices.
  On a spatial architecture like FPGAs, the values-driven approach is the norm.
We show how to express a sparse matrix computation and its optimizations for a
values-driven implementation. A compiler automatically synthesizes a code to
decode the structure. In this way, programmers focus on optimizing the
processing of the values, using familiar optimizations for dense matrices,
while leaving the complex, irregular structure traversal to an automatic
compiler. We also attempt to regularize the optimizations of the reduction for
a dynamic number of values, which is common in a sparse matrix computation.

the lower layer and the surface boundary layer, placed beneath the lower layer,
is modeled by the Ekman term, which is a linear dissipation term with respect
to the horizontal velocity at the lower layer. The Ekman term appears in the
governing equations asymmetrically; it is placed at the lower layer, but does
not appear at the upper layer. A variation, proposed by Phillips and Salmon,
uses extrapolation to place the Ekman term between the lower layer and the
surface boundary layer, or at the surface boundary layer. We present
theoretical results that show that in either the standard or the extrapolated
configurations, the Ekman term dissipates energy at large scales, but does not
dissipate potential enstrophy. It also creates an approximately symmetric
stable distribution of potential enstrophy between the two layers. The behavior
of the Ekman term changes fundamentally at small scales. Under the standard
formulation, the Ekman term will unconditionally dissipate energy and also
dissipate, under very minor conditions, potential enstrophy at small scales.
However, under the extrapolated formulation, there exist small ""negative
regions"", which are defined over a two-dimensional phase space, capturing the
distribution of energy per wavenumber between baroclinic energy and barotropic
energy, and the distribution of potential enstrophy per wavenumber between the
upper layer and the lower layer, where the Ekman term may inject energy or
potential enstrophy.

algorithms is compared, namely NSGA-II, PAES, SPEA2 and eps-MOEA, on three
established criteria of quality: cardinality, the spread of the solutions,
spacing, and the resulting score and number of turns. Although all four
algorithms show different strengths, eps-MOEA is selected to be the most
suitable for this problem. Ultimately, the simulation incorporates the model

As such, normal training with static price-based features (e.g. the close

the stochasticity of price variable, and train the model to work well under
