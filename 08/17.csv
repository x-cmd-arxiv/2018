sensing applications. Most existing methods detect vehicles with regular
rectangle boxes and fail to offer the orientation of vehicles. However, the
orientation information is crucial for several practical applications, such as
the trajectory and motion estimation of vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel deep network, called rotatable region-based residual network (R$^3$-Net),
to detect multi-oriented vehicles in aerial images and videos. More specially,
R$^3$-Net is utilized to generate rotatable rectangular target boxes in a half
coordinate system. First, we use a rotatable region proposal network (R-RPN) to
generate rotatable region of interests (R-RoIs) from feature maps produced by a
deep convolutional neural network. Here, a proposed batch averaging rotatable
anchor (BAR anchor) strategy is applied to initialize the shape of vehicle
candidates. Next, we propose a rotatable detection network (R-DN) for the final
classification and regression of the R-RoIs. In R-DN, a novel rotatable
position sensitive pooling (R-PS pooling) is designed to keep the position and
orientation information simultaneously while downsampling the feature maps of
R-RoIs. In our model, R-RPN and R-DN can be trained jointly. We test our
network on two open vehicle detection image datasets, namely DLR 3K Munich
Dataset and VEDAI Dataset, demonstrating the high precision and robustness of
our method. In addition, further experiments on aerial videos show the good
generalization capability of the proposed method and its potential for vehicle
tracking in aerial videos. The demo video is available at

the visual domain (faces) to the speech domain (voices) through cross-modal

most favorable for producing energetic flaring events reside in delta-spots, a
class of sunspots defined as having opposite polarity umbrae sharing a common
penumbra. They are frequently characterized by extreme compactness, strong
rotation and anti-Hale orientation. Numerous studies have shown that nearly all
of the largest solar flares originate in delta-spots, making the understanding
of these structures a fundamental step in predicting space weather. Despite
their important influence on the space environment, surprisingly little is
understood about the origin and behavior of delta-spots. In this paper, we
perform a systematic study of the behavior of emerging flux ropes to test a
theoretical model for the formation of delta-spots: the kink instability of
emerging flux ropes. We simulated the emergence of highly twisted,
kink-unstable flux ropes from the convection zone into the corona, and compared
their photospheric properties to those of emerged weakly twisted, kink-stable
flux ropes. We show that the photospheric manifestations of the emergence of
highly twisted flux ropes closely match the observed properties of delta-spots,
and we discuss the resulting implications for observations. Our results
strongly support and extend previous theoretical work that suggested that the
kink instability of emerging flux ropes is a promising candidate to explain
delta-spot formation, as it reproduces their key characteristics very well.

extrapolating the training data to a large region of the input space. One way
to achieve this is to constrain the predictions to be invariant to
transformations on the input that are known to be irrelevant (e.g.
translation). Commonly, this is done through data augmentation, where the
training set is enlarged by applying hand-crafted transformations to the
inputs. We argue that invariances should instead be incorporated in the model
structure, and learned using the marginal likelihood, which correctly rewards
the reduced complexity of invariant models. We demonstrate this for Gaussian
process models, due to the ease with which their marginal likelihood can be
estimated. Our main contribution is a variational inference scheme for Gaussian
processes containing invariances described by a sampling procedure. We learn
the sampling procedure by back-propagating through it to maximise the marginal

disk galaxies in the NIHAO simulations suite to explore the connection between
the atomic gas fraction and angular momentum of baryons throughout cosmic time.
The study is motivated by the analytic model of \citet{obreschkow16}, which
predicts a relation between the atomic gas fraction $f_{\rm atm}$ and the
global atomic stability parameter $q \equiv j\sigma / (GM)$, where $M$ and $j$
are the mass and specific angular momentum of the galaxy (stars+cold gas) and
$\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion of the atomic gas. We show that the
simulated galaxies follow this relation from their formation ($z\simeq4$) to
present within $\sim 0.5$ dex. To explain this behavior, we explore the
evolution of the local Toomre stability and find that $90\%$--$100\%$ of the
atomic gas in all simulated galaxies is stable at any time. In other words,
throughout the entire epoch of peak star formation until today, the timescale
for accretion is longer than the timescale to reach equilibrium, thus resulting
in a quasi-static equilibrium of atomic gas at any time. Hence, the evolution
of $f_{\rm atm}$ depends on the complex hierarchical growth history primarily
via the evolution of $q$. An exception are galaxies subject to strong
environmental effects.

The approximation behind this plot, developed by Guinier in 1939 provides a

However, when it is important to estimate further particle characteristics,

looped linearly through time series. This is due to the fact that its state,
which is looped upon throughout time steps within time series, stores the inner
states in a ""first in, first out"" queue which contains the $k$ most recent
states and on which it is easily possible to add static positional encoding
when the queue is represented as a tensor. This neural architecture yields
better results than the vanilla LSTM cells. It can obtain results of 91.92% for
the test accuracy, compared to the previously attained 91.65% using vanilla
LSTM cells. Note that this is not to compare to other research, where up to
93.35% is obtained, but costly using 18 LSTM cells rather than with 2 to 3
cells as analyzed here. Finally, an interesting discovery is made, such that
adding activation within the multi-head attention mechanism's linear layers can
yield better results in the context researched hereto.

mathematical model for amplitude evolution, and for calculating the energy
exchange in resonant and near-resonant global triads consisting of weakly
nonlinear internal gravity wave packets in weakly non-uniform density
stratifications in an unbounded domain in the presence of viscous and
rotational effects. Such triad interactions are one of the mechanisms by which
high wavenumber internal waves lead to ocean turbulence and mixing via
parametric subharmonic instability. Non-uniform stratification introduces
detuning - mismatch in the vertical wavenumber triad condition, which may
strongly affect the energy transfer process. We investigate in detail how
factors like wave-packets' width, group speeds, nonlinear coupling
coefficients, detuning, and viscosity affect energy transfer in weakly varying
stratification. We find limitations of the well-known 'pump-wave approximation'
and derive a non-dimensional number, which can be evaluated from initial
conditions, that can predict the maximum energy transferred from the primary
wave during the later stages. Two additional non-dimensional numbers, based on
various factors affecting energy transfer between near-resonant wave-packets
have also been defined. Moreover, we identify the optimal background
stratification in a medium of varying stratification for the primary wave to
form a triad with no detuning so that the energy transfer is maximum. Finally,
we show that even a small change in the background stratification can cause a
significant difference in the energy transfer process between the wave-packets
when they have the same order of magnitude of energy.

that allows electrons to transfer momentum to the crystal lattice and,
therefore, provide a finite electrical resistance in pure metals. However,
umklapp scattering has proven to be elusive in experiment as it is easily
obscured by other dissipation mechanisms. Here we show that electron-electron
umklapp scattering dominates the transport properties of
graphene-on-boron-nitride superlattices over a wide range of temperatures and
carrier densities. The umklapp processes cause giant excess resistivity that
rapidly increases with increasing the superlattice period and are responsible
for deterioration of the room-temperature mobility by more than an order of
magnitude as compared to standard, non-superlattice graphene devices. The
umklapp scattering exhibits a quadratic temperature dependence accompanied by a
pronounced electron-hole asymmetry with the effect being much stronger for
holes rather than electrons. Aside from fundamental interest, our results have
direct implications for design of possible electronic devices based on
heterostructures featuring superlattices.

often focus on groups of connected or potentially interacting individuals. When
the pathogen of interest is transmissible between study subjects, interference
may occur: individual infection outcomes may depend on treatments received by
others. Epidemiologists have defined the primary causal effect of interest --
called the ""susceptibility effect"" -- as a contrast in infection risk under
treatment versus no treatment, while holding exposure to infectiousness
constant. A related quantity -- the ""direct effect"" -- is defined as an
unconditional contrast between the infection risk under treatment versus no
treatment. The purpose of this paper is to show that under a widely recommended
randomization design, the direct effect may fail to recover the sign of the
true susceptibility effect of the intervention in a randomized trial when
outcomes are contagious. The analytical approach uses structural features of
infectious disease transmission to define the susceptibility effect. A new
probabilistic coupling argument reveals stochastic dominance relations between
potential infection outcomes under different treatment allocations. The results
suggest that estimating the direct effect under randomization may provide
misleading inferences about the effect of an intervention -- such as a vaccine
-- when outcomes are contagious.

function will be to veto neutron single-scatter events in the liquid xenon

$\approx50$ Hz above an energy threshold of 100 keV.

materials and use of ultra-low-background PMTs allows the measurement of a

rate from radioimpurities above 100 keV in the GdLS is estimated to be
$97.9\pm6.4$ Hz, with $65.5\pm1.9$ Hz resulting from $\alpha$-decays.

the prospect of using our analysis to estimate the DM density in local

models networks of coupled oscillators and is often used to study
synchronization among them. It has been observed that if the natural
frequencies of the oscillators are similar they will phase-lock, meaning that
they oscillate at a common frequency with fixed phase differences. Conversely,
we do not observe this behavior when the natural frequencies are very
dissimilar. Previously, Bronski and the author gave upper and lower bounds for
the volume of the set of frequencies exhibiting phase-locking behavior. This
was done under the assumption that any two oscillators affect each other with
equal strength. In this paper the author generalizes these upper and lower
bounds by removing this assumption. Similar to the previous work with Bronski,
where the upper and lower bounds are sums over spanning trees of the network,
our generalized upper and lower bounds are sums over certain directed subgraphs
of the network. In particular, our lower bound is a sum over directed spanning
trees. Finally, we numerically simulate the dependence of the number of
directed spanning trees on the presence of certain two edge motifs in the
network and compare this dependence with that of the synchronization of
oscillator models found by Nykamp, Zhao, and collaborators.

CMOS-compatible methods. A point defect that functions as the resonant cavity

smaller than the ones in the bulk of the crystal. We present a field-field
cross-correlation method to identify resonances in the finite-support crystal
with defect states that appear in the 3D photonic band gap of the infinite

s-polarized and 4 are p-polarized for light incident in the X or Z directions.
It is remarkable that quality factors up to Q = 1000 appear in such thin
structures (3 unit cells). We find that the optical energy density is
remarkably enhanced at the cavity resonances by up to 2400x the incident energy
density in vacuum or up to 1200x the energy density of the equivalent effective

interference between the discrete fundamental cavity mode and the continuum
light scattered by the photonic crystal. We argue that the five eigenstates of

is the existence of a coding scheme that performs this task with an optimal
ratio $m/n$ equal to $H(X)/H(Y)$, the ratio of the Shannon entropies of the two

($M_{\star}$) $10^{7-11}$ $M_{\odot}$ and star formation rates (SFR)
$\approx0.01-15$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We detect 128 NuSTAR sources to a
sensitivity of $\approx10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Using NuSTAR color-intensity and
color-color diagrams we classify 43 of these sources as candidate NS and 47 as
candidate BH. We further subdivide BH by accretion states (soft, intermediate,
and hard) and NS by weak (Z/Atoll) and strong (accreting pulsar) magnetic
field. Using 8 normal (Milky Way-type) galaxies in the sample, we confirm the
relation between SFR and galaxy X-ray point source luminosity in the 4-25 and
12-25 keV energy bands. We also constrain galaxy X-ray point source luminosity
using the relation $L_{\rm{X}}=\alpha M_{\star}+\beta\text{SFR}$, finding
agreement with previous work. The XLF of all sources in the 4-25 and 12-25 keV
energy bands matches with the $\alpha=1.6$ slope for high-mass XRBs. We find

documented, understanding the angular momentum transport mechanism that enables
disk accretion has proven to be an enduring challenge. The leading theory to

within the disk, is increasingly questioned, and magnetothermal disk winds,
which remove angular momentum from the disk, have emerged as an alternative
theoretical solution. Here we investigate whether measurements of disk radii
can provide useful insights into which, if either, of these mechanisms drive
disk accretion, by searching for evidence of viscous spreading in gaseous
disks, a potential signature of ""in disk"" angular momentum transport. We find
that the large sizes of most Class II (T Tauri) gas disks compared to those of

expectations for viscous spreading in the Class II phase. There is, however, a
large spread in the sizes of Class II gas disks at any age, including a
population of very small Class II gas disks. Their small sizes may result from
processes such as photoevaporation, disk winds, or truncation by orbiting low

Here, we concentrate on the azimuthal mass asymmetries near the image circle.
The motivation for considering such mass inhomogeneities is that the transition
between the central stellar dominated region and the outer dark matter
dominated region, though well represented by a power law density profile, is
unlikely to be featureless, and encodes information about the dynamical state
and assembly history of galaxies. It also happens to roughly coincide with the
Einstein radius. We ask if galaxies that have mass asymmetries beyond
ellipticity can be modeled with simpler lenses, i.e., can complex mass
distributions masquerade as simple elliptical+shear lenses? Our preliminary
study indicates that for galaxies with elliptical stellar and dark matter
distributions, but with no mass asymmetry, and an extended source filling the
diamond caustic, an elliptical+shear lens model can reproduce the images well,
thereby hiding the potential complexity of the actual mass distribution. For
galaxies with non-zero mass asymmetry, the answer depends on the size and
brightness distribution of the source, and its location within the diamond
caustic. In roughly half of the cases we considered the mass asymmetries can
easily evade detection.

undergoing collisions in the Sun's atmosphere after being redirected from
ingoing to outgoing in magnetic fields, though the exact mechanism is not
understood. An important new test of the gamma-ray production mechanism will
follow from observations at higher energies. Only the High Altitude Water
Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory has the required sensitivity to effectively probe
the Sun in the TeV range. Using three years of HAWC data from November 2014 to
December 2017, just prior to the solar minimum, we search for 1--100 TeV gamma
rays from the solar disk. No evidence of a signal is observed, and we set
strong upper limits on the flux at a few $10^{-12}$ TeV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ at 1 TeV. Our limit, which is the most constraining result on TeV
gamma rays from the Sun, is $\sim10\%$ of the theoretical maximum flux (based
on a model where all incoming cosmic rays produce outgoing photons), which in
turn is comparable to the Fermi-LAT data near 100 GeV. The prospects for a
first TeV detection of the Sun by HAWC are especially high during solar
minimum, which began in early 2018.

paying energy proportional to their displacement. Here, we introduce the
concept of symmetry enforced fractonicity, in which particles are fractons in
the presence of a global symmetry, but are free to move in its absence. A
simple example is dislocation defects in a two-dimensional crystal, which are
restricted to move only along their Burgers vector due to particle number
conservation. Utilizing a recently developed dual rank-2 tensor gauge
description of elasticity, we show that accounting for their symmetry enforced
one-dimensional nature of dislocation motion dramatically alters the structure
of quantum crystal melting phase transitions. We show that, at zero
temperature, sufficiently strong quantum fluctuations of the crystal lattice
favor the formation of a super-solid phase that spontaneously breaks the
symmetry enforcing fractonicity of defects. The defects can then condense to
drive the crystal into a super-nematic phase via a phase transition in the
$2+1d$ XY universality class to drive a melting phase transition of the crystal
to a nematic phase. This scenario contrasts the standard Halperin-Nelson
scenario for thermal melting of $2d$ solids in which dislocations can
proliferate via a single continuous thermal phase transition. We comment on the
application of these results to other scenarios such as vortex lattice melting
at a magnetic field induced superconductor-insulator transition, and quantum
melting of charge density waves of stripes in a metal.

in that, video content constitutes the major backbone of the total content
being published as well as watched. Thus it becomes imperative for video
recommendation engines such as Hulu to look for novel and innovative ways to
recommend the newly added videos to their users. However, the problem with new
videos is that they lack any sort of metadata and user interaction so as to be
able to rate the videos for the consumers. To this effect, this paper
introduces the several techniques we develop for the Content Based Video
Relevance Prediction (CBVRP) Challenge being hosted by Hulu for the ACM
Multimedia Conference 2018. We employ different architectures on the CBVRP
dataset to make use of the provided frame and video level features and generate
predictions of videos that are similar to the other videos. We also implement
several ensemble strategies to explore complementarity between both the types
of provided features. The obtained results are encouraging and will impel the
boundaries of research for multimedia based video recommendation systems.

Statistical Physics for adsorption on two-dimensional surfaces. Objects are
deposited sequentially at random and adsorb irreversibly on the landing site,
provided that they do not overlap any previously adsorbed object. The kinetics
of adsorption ceases when no more objects can be adsorbed (jamming state).
Here, we investigate the role of post-relaxation on the jamming state and
percolation properties of RSA of dimers on a two-dimensional lattice. We
consider that, if the deposited dimer partially overlaps with a previously
adsorbed one, a sequence of dimer displacements may occur to accommodate the
new dimer. The introduction of this simple relaxation dynamics leads to a more
dense jamming state than the one obtained with RSA without relaxation. We also
consider the anisotropic case, where one dimer orientation is favored over the
other, finding a non-monotonic dependence of the jamming coverage on the
strength of anisotropy. We find that the density of adsorbed dimers at which
percolation occurs is reduced with relaxation, but the value depends on the
strength of anisotropy.

mitigation in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), with a special emphasis on
designing channel allocation (CA) schemes which alleviate the impact of
interference on WMN performance. But having countless CA schemes at one's
disposal makes the task of choosing a suitable CA for a given WMN extremely
tedious and time consuming. In this work, we propose a new interference
estimation and CA performance prediction algorithm called CALM, which is
inspired by social theory. We borrow the sociological idea of a ""sui generis""
social reality, and apply it to WMNs with significant success. To achieve this,
we devise a novel Sociological Idea Borrowing Mechanism that facilitates easy
operationalization of sociological concepts in other domains. Further, we
formulate a heuristic Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model called NETCAP which
makes use of link quality estimates generated by CALM to offer a reliable
framework for network capacity prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of CALM
by evaluating its theoretical estimates against experimental data obtained
through exhaustive simulations on ns-3 802.11g environment, for a comprehensive
CA test-set of forty CA schemes. We compare CALM with three existing
interference estimation metrics, and demonstrate that it is consistently more
reliable. CALM boasts of accuracy of over 90% in performance testing, and in
stress testing too it achieves an accuracy of 88%, while the accuracy of other
metrics drops to under 75%. It reduces errors in CA performance prediction by
as much as 75% when compared to other metrics. Finally, we validate the
expected network capacity estimates generated by NETCAP, and show that they are
quite accurate, deviating by as low as 6.4% on an average when compared to
experimentally recorded results in performance testing.

interactions of the jet-accelerated protons in a dense gaseous target. The

straightforwardly from the data obtained by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC and if such

based on self-trapped holes and oxygen interstitials are ruled out because they

introduce to TDA the idea of bagplotting, a powerful technique from
non-parametric statistics well adapted for differentiating between
topologically significant points, and noise, in persistence diagrams.
  Outside the setting of TDA, our model provides a setting for fashioning point
processes, in any dimension, in which both local interactions between the
points, along with global restraints on the general point cloud, are important
and perhaps competing.

many-body localized (MBL) spin and fermionic systems in one dimension. For spin
systems, using tensor networks we show that all eigenstates of these phases
have the same topological index as defined for SPT ground states. For unitary
on-site symmetries, the MBL phases are thus labeled by the elements of the
second cohomology group of the symmetry group. A similar classification is
obtained for anti-unitary on-site symmetries, time-reversal symmetry being a
special case with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification (cf. [Phys. Rev. B 98, 054204
(2018)]). For the classification of fermionic MBL phases, we propose a
fermionic tensor network diagrammatic formulation. We find that fermionic MBL
systems with an (anti-)unitary symmetry are classified by the elements of the
(generalized) second cohomology group if parity is included into the symmetry
group. However, our approach misses a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index expected
from the classification of fermionic SPT ground states. Furthermore, we show
that all found phases are stable to arbitrary symmetry-preserving local
perturbations. Conversely, different topological phases must be separated by a
transition marked by delocalized eigenstates. Finally, we demonstrate that the
classification of spin systems is complete in the sense that there cannot be
any additional topological indices pertaining to the properties of individual
eigenstates, but there can be additional topological indices that further
classify Hamiltonians.

the effect tidal disruption has on thermonuclear reactions and the synthesis of
intermediate to heavy ion elements. These encounters create diverse
thermonuclear environments characteristic of Type I supernovae and capable of
producing both intermediate and heavy mass elements in arbitrary ratios,
depending on the strength (or proximity) of the interaction. Nuclear ignition

set of devices. This development is driven by rapid improvements in automatic
speech recognition (ASR), which now performs on par with human listening in
many tasks. These improvements base on an ongoing evolution of DNNs as the
computational core of ASR. However, recent research results show that DNNs are
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which allow attackers to force the
transcription into a malicious output.
  In this paper, we introduce a new type of adversarial examples based on
psychoacoustic hiding. Our attack exploits the characteristics of DNN-based ASR
systems, where we extend the original analysis procedure by an additional
backpropagation step. We use this backpropagation to learn the degrees of
freedom for the adversarial perturbation of the input signal, i.e., we apply a
psychoacoustic model and manipulate the acoustic signal below the thresholds of
human perception. To further minimize the perceptibility of the perturbations,
we use forced alignment to find the best fitting temporal alignment between the
original audio sample and the malicious target transcription. These extensions
allow us to embed an arbitrary audio input with a malicious voice command that
is then transcribed by the ASR system, with the audio signal remaining barely
distinguishable from the original signal. In an experimental evaluation, we
attack the state-of-the-art speech recognition system Kaldi and determine the
best performing parameter and analysis setup for different types of input. Our
results show that we are successful in up to 98% of cases with a computational
effort of fewer than two minutes for a ten-second audio file. Based on user
studies, we found that none of our target transcriptions were audible to human
listeners, who still understand the original speech content with unchanged
accuracy.

opportunity for the first precise characterizations of the photometric
variability properties of these stars. We carried out a search for new mCP

photometric variability properties using Kepler data. As an aside, we describe
criteria for selecting mCP star candidates based on light curve properties, and
assess the accuracy of the spectral classifications provided by the MKCLASS

to depend largely on alternative (nonspectroscopic) means of identifying
suitable candidates that rely mostly on light curve properties; in particular
we relied on monoperiodic variability and light curve stability. Newly acquired
and archival spectra were used to confirm most of our mCP star candidates.
Linear ephemeris parameters and effective amplitudes were derived from
detrended Kepler data. Our final sample consists of 41 spectroscopically
confirmed mCP stars of which 39 are new discoveries, 5 candidate mCP stars, and
7 stars in which no chemical peculiarities could be established. Our targets
populate the whole age range from zero-age main sequence to terminal-age main
sequence and are distributed in the mass interval from 1.5 M_sun to 4 M_sun.
About 25% of the mCP stars show a hitherto unobserved wealth of detail in their
light curves indicative of complex surface structures. We identified light
curve stability as a primary criterion for identifying mCP star candidates
among early-type stars in large photometric surveys, and prove the reliability

problems) have been studied in data mining, statistics and computer science
over the last several decades in applications such as medical condition
monitoring and weather change detection. In recent days, however, anomaly
detection problems have become increasing more relevant in the context of
$network$ $science$ since useful insights for many complex systems in biology,
finance and social science are often obtained by representing them via
networks. Notions of local and non-local curvatures of higher-dimensional
geometric shapes and topological spaces play a $fundamental$ role in physics
and mathematics in characterizing anomalous behaviours of these higher
dimensional entities. However, using curvature measures to detect anomalies in
networks is not yet very common. To this end, a main goal in this paper to
formulate and analyze curvature analysis methods to provide the foundations of
systematic approaches to find $critical$ $components$ and $detect$ $anomalies$
in networks. For this purpose, we use two measures of network curvatures which
depend on non-trivial global properties, such as distributions of geodesics and
higher-order correlations among nodes, of the given network. Based on these
measures, we precisely formulate several computational problems related to
anomaly detection in static or dynamic networks, and provide non-trivial
computational complexity results for these problems. This paper must $not$ be
viewed as delivering the final word on appropriateness and suitability of
specific curvature measures. Instead, it is our hope that this paper will
stimulate and motivate further theoretical or empirical research concerning the
exciting interplay between notions of curvatures from network and non-network
domains, a $much$ desired goal in our opinion.

interfere with each other. This paper devises an optimization strategy named
FPLinQ to coordinate the link scheduling decisions among the interfering links,
along with power control and beamforming. The key enabler is a novel
optimization method called matrix fractional programming (FP) that generalizes
previous scalar and vector forms of FP in allowing multiple data streams per

understanding of FP by showing a connection to the minorization-maximization
(MM) algorithm. From an application perspective, this paper shows that as
compared to the existing methods for coordinating scheduling in the D2D
network, such as FlashLinQ, ITLinQ, and ITLinQ+, the proposed FPLinQ approach
is more general in allowing multiple antennas at both the transmitters and the

significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in a typical D2D

transferred from the free-carrier components into a bound excitation at

properties are again described by narrow and broad Drude responses comparable

e.g. finding the chemical compounds that are most similar to a query compound.
Graph similarity computation, such as Graph Edit Distance (GED) and Maximum
Common Subgraph (MCS), is the core operation of graph similarity search and
many other applications, but very costly to compute in practice. Inspired by
the recent success of neural network approaches to several graph applications,
such as node or graph classification, we propose a novel neural network based
approach to address this classic yet challenging graph problem, aiming to
alleviate the computational burden while preserving a good performance.
  The proposed approach, called SimGNN, combines two strategies. First, we
design a learnable embedding function that maps every graph into a vector,
which provides a global summary of a graph. A novel attention mechanism is
proposed to emphasize the important nodes with respect to a specific similarity
metric. Second, we design a pairwise node comparison method to supplement the
graph-level embeddings with fine-grained node-level information. Our model
achieves better generalization on unseen graphs, and in the worst case runs in
quadratic time with respect to the number of nodes in two graphs. Taking GED
computation as an example, experimental results on three real graph datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Specifically, our
model achieves smaller error rate and great time reduction compared against a
series of baselines, including several approximation algorithms on GED
computation, and many existing graph neural network based models. To the best
of our knowledge, we are among the first to adopt neural networks to explicitly
model the similarity between two graphs, and provide a new direction for future
research on graph similarity computation and graph similarity search.

departures from flat, circular motion in the inner regions of the disc. One
possible explanation for these observations is a disc warp, which could be
induced by a planet on a misaligned orbit. We present three-dimensional
numerical simulations of the tidal interaction between a protoplanetary disc
and a misaligned planet. For low planet masses we show that our simulations
accurately model the evolution of inclined planet orbit (up to moderate
inclinations). For a planet massive enough to carve a gap, the disc is
separated into two components and the gas interior and exterior to the planet
orbit evolve separately, forming an inner and outer disc. Due to the
inclination of the planet, a warp develops across the planet orbit such that
there is a relative tilt and twist between these discs. We show that when other
parameters are held constant, the relative inclination that develops between
the inner and outer disc depends on the outer radius of the total disc
modelled. For a given disc mass, our results suggest that the observational
relevance of the warp depends more strongly on the mass of the planet rather
than the inclination of the orbit.

obeying an organizing principle, i.e., they can be approximately described by a
radial acceleration relation or the Modified Newtonian Dynamics phenomenology.
We analyze the rotation curve data from the SPARC sample, and explicitly
demonstrate that both the diversity and uniformity are naturally reproduced in
a hierarchical structure formation model with the addition of dark matter
self-interactions. The required concentrations of the dark matter halos are
fully consistent with the concentration-mass relation predicted by the Planck
cosmological model. The inferred stellar mass-to-light ($3.6 \mu m$) ratios
scatter around $0.5 M_\odot/L_\odot$, as expected from population synthesis
models, leading to a tight radial acceleration relation and baryonic
Tully-Fisher relation. The inferred stellar-halo mass relation is consistent
with the expectations from abundance matching. These results indicate that the
inner dark matter halos of galaxies are thermalized due to the
self-interactions of dark matter particles.

applications of Wireless Sensor Networks. A fine-grained synchronization is
beneficial both at the system level, for example to favor deterministic radio
protocols, and at the application level, when network-wide event timestamping
is required. However, there is a tradeoff between the resolution of a WSN
node's timekeeping device and its energy consumption. The Virtual
High-resolution Timer (VHT) is an innovative solution, that was proposed to
overcome this tradeoff. It combines a high-resolution oscillator to a low-power
one, turning off the former when not needed. In this paper we improve VHT by
first identifying the jitter of the low-power oscillator as the current limit
to the technique, and then proposing an enhanced solution that synchronizes the
fast and the slow clock, rejecting the said jitter. The improved VHT is also
less demanding than the original technique in terms of hardware resources.
Experimental results show the achieved advantages in terms of accuracy.

many application domains. Despite the advancements and impressive achievements
of machine learning, it has been shown that learning algorithms can be
compromised by attackers both at training and test time. Machine learning
systems are especially vulnerable to adversarial examples where small
perturbations added to the original data points can produce incorrect or
unexpected outputs in the learning algorithms at test time. Mitigation of these
attacks is hard as adversarial examples are difficult to detect. Existing
related work states that the security of machine learning systems against
adversarial examples can be weakened when feature selection is applied to
reduce the systems' complexity. In this paper, we empirically disprove this
idea, showing that the relative distortion that the attacker has to introduce
to succeed in the attack is greater when the target is using a reduced set of
features. We also show that the minimal adversarial examples differ
statistically more strongly from genuine examples with a lower number of
features. However, reducing the feature count can negatively impact the
system's performance. We illustrate the trade-off between security and accuracy
with specific examples. We propose a design methodology to evaluate the
security of machine learning classifiers with embedded feature selection
against adversarial examples crafted using different attack strategies.

where the lightest neutralino, as the best--known supersymmetric (SUSY) WIMP,
obtains the required relic abundance. Many of these new sets of parameters are
also compatible with current limits from colliders as well as direct and

neutralinos, which emerge naturally as lightest neutralino in many models, can
have the desired relic density only in some finetuned regions of parameter
space where the effective annihilation cross section is enhanced by
co--annihilation or an $s-$channel pole. In contrast, if the energy density of
the universe was dominated by long--lived PeV--scale particles (e.g. moduli or

carried out molecular statics simulations and found the results to be in good

described by Lennard-Jones 6-12 potential in both our analysis and simulations

ribbons from 1D sinusoidally textured substrates. In the molecular statics

the ribbons slide over the substrate and undergo adhesion and peeling near the
crack front in an oscillatory manner, the frequency of which reveals the
wavelength of the underlying substrate. Our theory qualitatively captures these

seek a parametrized dynamical model that will yield uniformly small response

internal system dynamics or equivalently, to realizations of the original
system is either not possible or not practical; only response observations over
a range of parameter settings might be known. Respecting these typical
operational constraints, we propose a two phase approach that first encodes the
response data into a high fidelity intermediate model of modest order, followed
then by a compression stage that serves to eliminate redundancy in the
intermediate model. For the first phase, we extend non-parametric least-squares
fitting approaches so as to accommodate parameterized systems. This results in
a (discrete) least-squares problem formulated with respect to both frequency
and parameter that identifies ""local"" system response features. The second
phase uses an $\mathbf{\mathcal{H}}_2$-optimal model reduction strategy
accommodating the specialized parametric structure of the intermediate model
obtained in the first phase. The final compressed model inherits the parametric
dependence of the intermediate model and maintains the high fidelity of the
intermediate model, while generally having dramatically smaller system order.
We provide a variety of numerical examples demonstrating our approach.

metal are investigated. For the corresponding static systems, we consider two
graphene models of valley-polarized metal with either a staggered sublattice or
uniform intrinsic spin-orbital coupling, whose Dirac point energies are
different from the intrinsic Fermi level. If the frequency of irradiation is
appropriately designed, the largest dynamical gap (first-order dynamical gap)
opens around the intrinsic Fermi level. In the presence of the irradiation, two
types of edge state appear at the zigzag edge of semi-infinite sheet with
energy within the first-order dynamical gap: the Floquet edge states and the
strongly localized edge states. In narrow zigzag nanoribbons, the Floquet edge
states are gapped out by the finite size effect, and the strongly localized
edge states remain gapless. As a result, the conducting channels of the
nanoribbons consist of the strongly localized edge states. Under the first and
second model, the strongly localized edge states carry one-way spin polarized
and one-way charge current around the intrinsic Fermi level, respectively.
Thus, the narrow zigzag nanoribbons of the first and second model have
asymmetric spin and charge transmission rates, respectively. Quantum-transport
calculations predict sizable pumped currents of charge and spin, which could be
controlled by the Fermi level.

displacing the positions of many air holes of a base nanocavity and their Q
factors calculated by a first-principle method. We train a four-layer neural
network including a convolutional layer to recognize the relationship between
the air holes' displacements and the Q factors using the prepared dataset.
After the training, the neural network becomes able to estimate the Q factors
from the air holes' displacements with an error of 13% in standard deviation.
Crucially, the trained neural network can estimate the gradient of the Q factor
with respect to the air holes' displacements very quickly based on
back-propagation. A nanocavity structure with an extremely high Q factor of
1.58 x 10^9 is successfully obtained by optimizing the positions of 50 air
holes over ~10^6 iterations, having taken advantage of the very fast evaluation
of the gradient in high-dimensional parameter space. The obtained Q factor is
more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the base cavity and more
than twice that of the highest Q factors reported so far for cavities with
similar modal volumes. This approach can optimize 2D-PC structures over a

is explored using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We confirm that the
scattering by the clumpy IGM has significant line-of-sight variations. We
demonstrate that the scattering by the IGM in the voids and walls of the cosmic
web is weak, but it can be significantly enhanced by the gas in clusters and
filaments. The observed non-monotonic dependence of the FRB widths on the
dispersion measures (DM) cannot determine whether the IGM is an important
scattering matter or not. The IGM may dominate the scattering of some FRBs, and
the host galaxy dominates others. For the former case, the scattering should be
primarily caused by the medium in clusters. A mock sample of 500 sources shows
that $\tau_{\rm{IGM}} \propto \rm{DM_{IGM}}^{1.6-2.1}$ at $z<1.5$. Assuming
that the turbulence follows Kolmogorov scaling, we find that an outer scale of
$L_0\sim 5\,$pc is required to make $\tau_{\rm{IGM}} \sim 1-10\,$ms at $\nu=1\,
$ GHz. The required $L_0\sim 5\, $pc can alleviate the tension in the
timescales of turbulent heating and cooling but is still $\sim 4$ orders of
magnitude lower than the presumed injection scale of turbulence in the IGM. The
gap is expected to be effectively shortened if the simulation resolution is
further increased. The mechanisms that may further reduce the gap are shortly
discussed. If future observations can justify the role of the IGM in the

uncertainty quantification is fundamental to improve the predictive

accurate estimates of the QoI statistics while requiring a small number of

(2017) has many advantageous properties compared to the classical semi-implicit

growth of the finite grid instability. We have implemented ECSIM in a different
and more efficient manner than the original approach. More importantly, we have
addressed two major shortcomings of the original ECSIM algorithm: there is no
mechanism to enforce Gauss's law and there is no mechanism to reduce the
numerical oscillations of the electric field. A classical approach to satisfy
Gauss's law is to modify the electric field and its divergence using either an
elliptic or a parabolic/hyperbolic correction based on the Generalized Lagrange
Multiplier method. This correction, however, violates the energy conservation
property, and the oscillations related to the finite grid instability reappear
in the modified ECSIM scheme. We invented a new alternative approach: the
particle positions are modified instead of the electric field in the correction
step. Displacing the particles slightly does not change the energy conservation
property, while it can satisfy Gauss's law by changing the charge density. We
found that the new Gauss's Law satisfying Energy Conserving Semi-Implicit
Method (GL-ECSIM) produces superior results compared to the original ECSIM
algorithm. In some simulations, however, there are still some numerical
oscillations present in the electric field. We attribute this to the simple
finite difference discretization of the energy conserving implicit electric
field solver. We modified the spatial discretization of the field solver to
reduce these oscillations while only slightly violating the energy conservation
properties. We demonstrate the improved quality of the GL-ECSIM method with
several tests.

condensation regardless of the $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ ratio, which is here
relatively high, $\sim 40$. However, the measured ratio of cooling time and
eddy turnover time around unity ($C$-ratio $\approx 1$) implies significant
condensation, and at the same time, the constrained ratio of rotational
velocity and the velocity dispersion (turbulent Taylor number) ${\rm Ta_t} > 1$
indicates that the condensing gas should follow non-radial orbits forming a
disc instead of filaments. This is in agreement with hydrodynamical simulations
of massive rotating galaxies predicting a similarly extended multiphase disc.

capable of extracting the most representative features by an unsupervised data

superconductivity emerges upon cooling from the generally complex normal state.
Some of the most prominent unconventional superconductors are oxides: strontium
titanate, strontium ruthenate, and the cuprates exhibit greatly different
superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$, and although their respective
superconducting pairing mechanisms remain unknown, they are thought to differ
as well. Here we use nonlinear magnetic response, a probe that is uniquely
sensitive to the superconducting precursor, to uncover remarkable universal
behavior in these three distinct classes of superconductors. We find unusual
exponential temperature dependence of the diamagnetic response above the
transition temperature $T_c$, with a characteristic temperature scale that
strongly varies with $T_c$. We correlate this scale with the sensitivity of
$T_c$ to local stress, and show that it is influenced by intentionally-induced
structural disorder. The universal behavior is therefore caused by intrinsic,
self-organized structural inhomogeneity, inherent to the oxides
perovskite-based structure. The prevalence of such inhomogeneity has
far-reaching implications for the interpretation of electronic properties of
perovskite-related oxides in general.

for the minimum $k$-cut problem via greedy recursive tree packings.
  In this paper we revisit properties of an LP relaxation for $k$-cut proposed
by Naor and Rabani, and analyzed by Chekuri, Guha and Naor. We show that the
dual of the LP yields a tree packing, that when combined with an upper bound on
the integrality gap for the LP, easily and transparently extends Karger's
analysis for mincut to the $k$-cut problem. In addition to the simplicity of
the algorithm and its analysis, this allows us to improve the running time of
Thorup's algorithm by a factor of $n$. We also improve the bound on the number
of $\alpha$-approximate $k$-cuts. Second, we give a simple proof that the
integrality gap of the LP is $2(1-1/n)$. Third, we show that an optimum
solution to the LP relaxation, for all values of $k$, is fully determined by
the principal sequence of partitions of the input graph. This allows us to
relate the LP relaxation to the Lagrangian relaxation approach of Barahona and
Ravi and Sinha; it also shows that the idealized recursive tree packing
considered by Thorup gives an optimum dual solution to the LP. This work arose

through Earth's atmosphere, from which they can derive pre-entry orbits.
Triangulated atmospheric trajectory data requires different orbit determination
methods to those applied to observational data beyond the Earth's
sphere-of-influence, such as telescopic observations of asteroids. Currently,
the vast majority of fireball networks determine and publish orbital data using
an analytical approach, with little flexibility to include orbital
perturbations. Here we present a novel numerical technique for determining
meteoroid orbits from fireball network data and compare it to previously
established methods. The re-entry of the Hayabusa spacecraft, with its known
pre-Earth orbit, provides a unique opportunity to perform this comparison as it
was observed by fireball network cameras. As initial sightings of the Hayabusa
spacecraft and capsule were made at different altitudes, we are able to
quantify the atmosphere's influence on the determined pre-Earth orbit.
Considering these trajectories independently, we found the orbits determined by
the novel numerical approach to align closer to JAXA's telemetry in both cases.
Comparing the orbits determined from the capsule's re-entry shows the need for
an atmospheric model, which the prevailing analytical approach lacks. Using
simulations, we determine the atmospheric perturbation to become significant at
~90 km; higher than the first observations of typical meteorite dropping
events. Using further simulations, we find the most substantial differences
between techniques to occur at both low entry velocities and Moon passing
trajectories. These regions of comparative divergence demonstrate the need for
perturbation inclusion within the chosen orbit determination algorithm.

introduction of a band index violates the Ward-Takahashi identity for interband
transitions resulting in a longitudinal component appearing in the upper phonon
band. Thus both the spinors and the vector bosons acquire mass and a crystal
with an electronic band gap and optical phonon modes results. In the limit that
the coupling of bosons charged under the SU(2) gauge group goes to zero,
breaking the electron U(1) symmetry recovers the BCS mechanism. In the limit

aerosols emitted from different source regions and global shipping. We also
analyse aerosol burdens, cloud condensation nuclei concentration, liquid water
path, and ice water path. Due to transboundary transport and sub-linearity in
the response of clouds to aerosols, the cloud radiative effects of emissions
from a given source region are influenced by emissions from other source
regions. For example, the shortwave cloud radiative effect of shipping is
$-0.39 \pm 0.03$ W m$^{-2}$ when other anthropogenic emissions sources are
present (the `present-day background' assumption) compared with $-0.60 \pm
0.03$ W m$^{-2}$ when other anthropogenic emissions sources are absent (the
`natural background' assumption). In general, the cloud radiative effects are
weaker if present-day background conditions are assumed compared with if
natural background conditions are assumed. Assumptions about background
conditions should be carefully considered when investigating the climate
impacts of aerosol emissions from a given source region.

  with Task Loss",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reducing bit-widths of activations and weights of deep networks makes it
efficient to compute and store them in memory, which is crucial in their
deployments to resource-limited devices, such as mobile phones. However,
decreasing bit-widths with quantization generally yields drastically degraded
accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose to learn to quantize activations
and weights via a trainable quantizer that transforms and discretizes them.
Specifically, we parameterize the quantization intervals and obtain their
optimal values by directly minimizing the task loss of the network. This
quantization-interval-learning (QIL) allows the quantized networks to maintain
the accuracy of the full-precision (32-bit) networks with bit-width as low as
4-bit and minimize the accuracy degeneration with further bit-width reduction
(i.e., 3 and 2-bit). Moreover, our quantizer can be trained on a heterogeneous
dataset, and thus can be used to quantize pretrained networks without access to
their training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our trainable
quantizer on ImageNet dataset with various network architectures such as
ResNet-18, -34 and AlexNet, on which it outperforms existing methods to achieve
the state-of-the-art accuracy.

are classes of states for which the positivity is guaranteed, e.g., states not

extension of maps to quantitatively analyze the difference between positive

positive but not completely positive maps on uncorrelated states by allowing an
extra resource of consuming multiple copies of the input state and characterize
the positive maps in terms of implementability with multiple copies. We show
that by consuming multiple copies, the set of implementable positive maps
becomes larger, and almost all positive maps are implementable with finite
copies of an input state. The number of copies of the input state required to
implement a positive map quantifies the degree by which a positive map violates
complete positivity. We then analyze the optimal N-copy implementability of a
noisy version of the transposition map.

point is identifying a viable mechanism to convert the Poynting flux into the
kinetic energy of the plasma, and eventually into the observed radiation. Since
the plasma is hardly accelerated beyond equipartition, MHD instabilities are
often invoked to explain the dissipation of the magnetic energy. Motivated by
the fast variability that is shown by the gamma-ray flares of both AGN and
PWNe, different authors have proposed the Poynting flux to be dissipated in a
region where the flow is converging. Here we perform a linear stability
analysis of ultra-relativistic, highly magnetised outflows with such a
recollimation nozzle, showing that MHD instabilities are indeed induced by the
convergence of the flow. The amplitude of the perturbations increases while
recollimation gets stronger, and eventually diverges when the flow is focused
to a single point. Hence, depending on the geometry of the outflow,
instabilities excited while the flow is converging may play an important role
to dissipate the magnetic energy of the plasma.

distribution, which results in a bivariate probit model. To address the problem
of misspecification in this practice, we propose an easy-to-implement
semiparametric estimation framework with parametric copula and nonparametric
marginal distributions. We establish asymptotic theory, including root-n
normality, for the sieve maximum likelihood estimators that can be used to
conduct inference on the individual structural parameters and the average
treatment effect (ATE). In order to show the practical relevance of the
proposed framework, we conduct a sensitivity analysis via extensive Monte Carlo
simulation exercises. The results suggest that the estimates of the parameters,
especially the ATE, are sensitive to parametric specification, while
semiparametric estimation exhibits robustness to underlying data generating
processes. We then provide an empirical illustration where we estimate the
effect of health insurance on doctor visits. In this paper, we also show that
the absence of excluded instruments may result in identification failure, in

parallax data based on Hipparcos and HST data, to derive the
period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relation for Galactic classical cepheids
(CCs) in the V,K, and Wesenheit WVK bands. An initial sample of 452 CCs are
extracted from the literature with spectroscopically derived iron abundances.
Reddening values, pulsation periods, and mean magnitudes are taken from the
literature.
  Based on nine CCs with a goodness-of-fit (GOF) statistic <8 and with an
accurate non-Gaia parallax, a parallax zero-point offset of -0.049 +- 0.018 mas
is derived. Selecting a GOF statistic <8 removes about 40\% of the sample most
likely related due to binarity. Excluding first overtone and multi-mode
cepheids and applying some other criteria reduces the sample to about 200
stars.
  The derived PL(Z) relations depend strongly on the parallax zero-point
offset. The slope of the PL relation is found to be different from the
relations in the LMC at the 3 sigma level. Fixing the slope to the value found
in the LMC leads to a distance modulus (DM) to the LMC of order 18.7 mag,
larger than the canonical distance. The canonical DM of around 18.5 mag would
require a parallax zero-point offset of order $-0.1$ mas.
  Given the strong correlation between zero point, period and metallicity
dependence of the PL relation, and the parallax zero-point offset there is no
evidence for a metallicity term in the PLZ relation.
  The GDR2 release does not allow us to improve on the current distance scale
based on CCs. The value of and the uncertainty on the parallax zero-point
offset leads to uncertainties of order 0.15 mag on the distance scale. The
parallax zero-point offset will need to be known at a level of 3 microas or
better to have a 0.01 mag or smaller effect on the zero point of the PL
relation and the DM to the LMC.

cellular networks, higher computation overhead is incurred in smartphones,
which can cause the wireless transmission rates to be limited by the
computation capability of wireless terminals. In this case, is there a maximum
receiving rate for smartphones to maintain stable wireless communications in 5G
cellular networks? The main objective of this article is to investigate the
maximum receiving rate of smartphones and its influence on 5G cellular
networks. Based on Landauer's principle and the safe temperature bound on the
smartphone surface, a maximum receiving rate of the smartphone is proposed for
5G cellular networks. Moreover, the impact of the maximum receiving rate of
smartphones on the link adaptive transmission schemes has been investigated.
Numerical analyses imply that the maximum receiving rate of smartphones cannot
always catch up with the downlink rates of future 5G cellular networks.
Therefore, the link adaptive transmission scheme for future 5G cellular
networks has to take the maximum receiving rate of smartphones into account.

technology must be further developed before it can be routinely used in

a flexible framework for hand-eye calibration of an ophthalmic robot with a

calibration parameters; b) with micro-scale displacements controlled by the

transformation between the coordinate system of the OCT camera and the
coordinate system of the robot. We verified the capability of our framework in

initio} energies are required only for the points in the training set, while
the energies for the remaining points are provided by the ML model with
negligible computational cost. The proposed sampling procedure is shown to be
superior to random sampling and also eliminates the need for training several
ML models. Self-correcting machine learning has been implemented such that each
additional layer corrects errors from the previous layer. The performance of
our approach is demonstrated in a case study on a published high-level
\textit{ab initio} PES of methyl chloride with 44,819 points. The ML model is
trained on sets of different size and then used to predict the energies for
tens of thousands of nuclear configurations within seconds. The resulting
datasets are utilized in variational calculations of the vibrational energy
levels of CH$_3$Cl. By using both structure-based sampling and self-correction,
the size of the training set can be kept small (e.g. 10\% of the points)
without any significant loss of accuracy. In \textit{ab initio} rovibrational
spectroscopy, it is thus possible to reduce the number of computationally
costly electronic structure calculations through structure-based sampling and
self-correcting KKR-based machine learning by up to 90\%.

the form $\phi_* [\H_{g,G,\xi}]$. Examples include the fundamental classes of
the loci of hyperelliptic or bielliptic curves $C$ with marked ramification
points.
  The two main results of this paper are as follows: Firstly, for the gluing

give a combinatorial formula for the pullback $\xi^*_A \phi_*[\H_{g,G,\xi}]$ in

tautological classes. Secondly, the pull-push $\delta_*\phi^*$ sends
tautological classes to tautological classes and we also give a combinatorial
description of this map in terms of standard generators of the tautological

attain a remarkably regular horizontal toroidal structure while sedimenting,
with a number of intertwined loops, oscillating periodically around each other.
We then recover this motion numerically and find out that it is accompanied by
a very slow rotation around the vertical symmetry axis. We analyze the
dependence of the characteristic time scales on the chain flexibility and
aspect ratio. It is observed in the experiments that this oscillating mode of
the dynamics can spontaneously form even when starting from a qualitatively
different initial configuration. In numerical simulations, the oscillating
modes are usually present as transients or final stages of the evolution,
depending on chain aspect ratio and flexibility, and the number of loops.

especially Wirless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Despite the great effort and the
numerous improvements, the existing synchronization schemes do not yet address
the cancellation of propagation delays. Up to a few years ago, this was not
perceived as a problem, because the time-stamping precision was a more limiting
factor for the accuracy achievable with a synchronization scheme. However, the
recent introduction of efficient flooding schemes based on constructive
interference has greatly improved the achievable accuracy, to the point where
propagation delays can effectively become the main source of error. In this
paper, we propose a method to estimate and compensate for the network
propagation delays. Our proposal does not require to maintain a spanning tree
of the network, and exploits constructive interference even to transmit packets
whose content are slightly different. To show the validity of the approach, we
implemented the propagation delay estimator on top of the FLOPSYNC-2
synchronization scheme. Experimental results prove the feasibility of measuring
propagation delays using off-the-shelf microcontrollers and radio transceivers,
and show how the proposed solution allows to achieve sub-microsecond clock
synchronization even for networks where propagation delays are significant.

invariant representations of spatiotemporal input streams is the hierarchical
temporal memory (HTM). This unsupervised online algorithm has been demonstrated
on several machine-learning tasks, including anomaly detection. Significant
effort has been made in formalizing and applying the HTM algorithm to different
classes of problems. There are few early explorations of the HTM hardware
architecture, especially for the earlier version of the spatial pooler of HTM
algorithm. In this article, we present a full-scale HTM architecture for both
spatial pooler and temporal memory. Synthetic synapse design is proposed to
address the potential and dynamic interconnections occurring during learning.
The architecture is interweaved with parallel cells and columns that enable
high processing speed for the HTM. The proposed architecture is verified for
two different datasets: MNIST and the European number plate font (EUNF), with
and without the presence of noise. The spatial pooler architecture is
synthesized on Xilinx ZYNQ-7, with 91.16% classification accuracy for MNIST and
90\% accuracy for EUNF, with noise. For the temporal memory sequence
prediction, first and second order predictions are observed for a 5-number long
sequence generated from EUNF dataset and 95% accuracy is obtained. Moreover,
the proposed hardware architecture offers 1364X speedup over the software
realization. These results indicate that the proposed architecture can serve as
a digital core to build the HTM in hardware and eventually as a standalone
self-learning system.

high dimensionality of the solution's phase space. The commonly used discrete
ordinates (S$_N$) method suffers from ray effects which result from a break in
rotational symmetry from the finite set of directions chosen by S$_N$. The
spherical harmonics (P$_N$) equations, on the other hand, preserve rotational
symmetry, but can produce negative particle densities. The discrete ordinates
(S$_N$) method, in turn, by construction ensures non-negative particle
densities.
  In this paper we present a modified version of the S$_N$ method, the rotated
S$_N$ (rS$_N$) method. Compared to S$_N$, we add a rotation and interpolation
step for the angular quadrature points and the respective function values after
every time step. Thereby, the number of directions on which the solution
evolves is effectively increased and ray effects are mitigated. Solution values
on rotated ordinates are computed by an interpolation step. Implementation
details are provided and in our experiments the rotation/interpolation step
only adds 5% to 10% to the runtime of the S$_N$ method. We apply the rS$_N$
method to the line-source and a lattice test case, both being prone to
ray-effects. Ray effects are reduced significantly, even for small numbers of
quadrature points. The rS$_N$ method yields qualitatively similar solutions to
the S$_N$ method with less than a third of the number of quadrature points,
both for the line-source and the lattice problem. The code used to produce our
results is freely available and can be downloaded.

Their equivalence is conjectured in general.
  On the geometric aspect, we conjecture that unirationality characterizes

in case (1), assuming the same is true for K3 surfaces. In case (2), we show
that the rational chain connectedness is equivalent to supersingularity.

generally agree and that 41% (Cycle 23) and 47% (Cycle 24) of RHESSI flares
occur within $30^\circ$ of the PFSS determined-HSB. The behaviour of the HSBs
varies over the two Cycles studied, and as expected they swap in hemisphere as
the Cycles change. The HSBs and active longitudes do overlap but not
consistently. They often move at different rates relative to each other (and
the Carrington solar rotation rate) and these vary over each Cycle. The HSBs

this dissertation, we provide two solutions to fit a probabilistic index model.
The first algorithm consists of splitting the entire data set into unique
partitions. On each of these, we fit the model and then aggregate the
estimates. A second algorithm is a subsampling scheme in which we select $K <<
n$ observations without replacement and after B iterations aggregate the
estimates. In Monte Carlo simulations, we show how the partitioning algorithm
outperforms the latter [...] We illustrate the partitioning algorithm and the
interpretation of the probabilistic index model on a real data set (Przybylski
and Weinstein, 2017) of n = 116,630 where we compare it against the ordinary
least squares method. By modelling the probabilistic index, we give an
intuitive and meaningful quantification of the effect of the time adolescents
spend using digital devices such as smartphones on self-reported mental
well-being. We show how moderate usage is associated with an increased
probability of reporting a higher mental well-being compared to random
adolescents who do not use a smartphone. On the other hand, adolescents who
excessively use their smartphone are associated with a higher probability of
reporting a lower mental well-being than randomly chosen peers who do not use a
smartphone.[...]

features in time-varying scalar data. Structures are tracked based on the
optimal matching between persistence diagrams with respect to the Wasserstein
metric. This fundamentally relies on solving the assignment problem, a special
case of optimal transport, for all consecutive timesteps. Our approach relies
on two main contributions. First, we revisit the seminal assignment algorithm
by Kuhn and Munkres which we specifically adapt to the problem of matching
persistence diagrams in an efficient way. Second, we propose an extension of
the Wasserstein metric that significantly improves the geometrical stability of
the matching of domain-embedded persistence pairs. We show that this
geometrical lifting has the additional positive side-effect of improving the
assignment matrix sparsity and therefore computing time. The global framework
implements a coarse-grained parallelism by computing persistence diagrams and
finding optimal matchings in parallel for every couple of consecutive
timesteps. Critical trajectories are constructed by associating successively
matched persistence pairs over time. Merging and splitting events are detected
with a geometrical threshold in a post-processing stage. Extensive experiments
on real-life datasets show that our matching approach is an order of magnitude
faster than the seminal Munkres algorithm. Moreover, compared to a modern
approximation method, our method provides competitive runtimes while yielding
exact results. We demonstrate the utility of our global framework by extracting
critical point trajectories from various simulated time-varying datasets and
compare it to the existing methods based on associated overlaps of volumes.
Robustness to noise and temporal resolution downsampling is empirically
demonstrated.

MAGNs are very numerous and well studied in the lower energies of the

near a massive object. For galaxy scale lenses, this delay becomes relevant for
GWs with frequencies between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-9}$ Hz, sourced by super
massive binary black-holes. In addition to GWs detectable by Pulsar Timing

determine that an 8 - 12 micron absorption feature attributed to the
mixed-composition, predominantly silicate cloud particles is a viable marker
for the presence of cloud. Further calculations explore, and trends are

artificially scaled gravitational settling on the transmission spectrum.
Principally, by varying the upper extent of our cloud decks, rainout is
identified to be a key process for the dynamical atmospheres of hot-Jupiters

Instead, the nodes can be placed with higher density in areas where there is a
need for higher accuracy. Still, the discretization matrix is fairly sparse. As
a model problem, we consider the pricing of European options in 2D. Since such
options have a discontinuity in the first derivative of the payoff function
which prohibits high order convergence, we smooth this function using an
established technique for Cartesian grids. Numerical experiments show that we
acquire a fourth order scheme in space, both for the uniform and the nonuniform
node layouts that we use. The high order method with the nonuniform node layout
achieves very high accuracy with relatively few nodes. This renders the
potential for solving pricing problems in higher spatial dimensions since the
computational memory and time demand become much smaller with this method

efficiency of a downlink cellular network. Rather than relying on the first
order statistics of received signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) such as
coverage probability, we focus on characterizing its meta-distribution. Our
analysis is based on the alpha-beta-gamma (ABG) path-loss model which provides
us with the flexibility to analyze urban macro (UMa) and urban micro (UMi)
deployments. With the help of an analytical framework, we demonstrate that
selection of underlying degrees-of-freedom such as BS height for optimization
of first order statistics such as coverage probability is not optimal in the
network-wide sense. Consequently, the SIR meta-distribution must be employed to
select appropriate operational points which will ensure consistent user
experiences across the network. Our design framework reveals that the
traditional results which advocate lowering of BS heights or even optimal
selection of BS height do not yield consistent service experience across users.
By employing the developed framework we also demonstrate how available spectral
resources in terms of time slots/channel partitions can be optimized by
considering the meta-distribution of the SIR.

the strongest prognostic markers for breast cancer. This procedure, however, is
time-consuming and error-prone. We developed a method to automatically detect
mitotic figures in breast cancer tissue sections based on convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Application of CNNs to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
histological tissue sections is hampered by: (1) noisy and expensive reference
standards established by pathologists, (2) lack of generalization due to
staining variation across laboratories, and (3) high computational requirements
needed to process gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this paper, we
present a method to train and evaluate CNNs to specifically solve these issues
in the context of mitosis detection in breast cancer WSIs. First, by combining
image analysis of mitotic activity in phosphohistone-H3 (PHH3) restained slides
and registration, we built a reference standard for mitosis detection in entire
H&E WSIs requiring minimal manual annotation effort. Second, we designed a data
augmentation strategy that creates diverse and realistic H&E stain variations
by modifying the hematoxylin and eosin color channels directly. Using it during
training combined with network ensembling resulted in a stain invariant mitosis
detector. Third, we applied knowledge distillation to reduce the computational
requirements of the mitosis detection ensemble with a negligible loss of
performance. The system was trained in a single-center cohort and evaluated in
an independent multicenter cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas on the three
tasks of the Tumor Proliferation Assessment Challenge (TUPAC). We obtained a
performance within the top-3 best methods for most of the tasks of the

motion and topological changes of the fluid domain, and the application of a
novel Nitsche-based approach to incorporate the Beavers-Joseph (-Saffmann)

sophisticated molecular beam epitaxial procedure to grow atomically smooth
epitaxial Ag films. However, the procedure is rather slow and becomes
impractical to grow films with thickness > 50 nm. Another approach adopts a
growth process using rapid e-beam deposition which is capable of growing single

procedure makes it difficult to control film thickness precisely, i.e., the
method is not applicable to growing thin epitaxial films. Here we report a

vaccination and social distancing measures to slow transmission. Their success
depends on not only strategies and resources, but also public adherence.
Individual willingness to take precautions may be influenced by global factors,
such as news media, or local factors, such as infected family members or
friends. Here, we compare three modes of epidemiological decision-making in the
midst of a growing outbreak. Individuals decide whether to adopt a recommended
intervention based on overall disease prevalence, the proportion of social
contacts infected, or the number of social contacts infected. While all
strategies can substantially mitigate transmission, vaccinating (or self
isolating) based on the number of infected acquaintances is expected to achieve
the greatest herd immunity and number of infections averted, while requiring
the fewest intervention resources.

precise and unbiased fuel economy estimates to assist consumers in their

the numbers must be relatively reliable. This study focuses on quantifying the
variations of on-road fuel economy relative to official government ratings
(fuel economy gap) and seeks proper characterizations for the degree of
stochastic dependence between the fuel economy gaps of pairs of vehicles.By
using unique data reported by customers of the U.S. government website
www.fueleconomy.gov, the study presents an innovative copula-based
joint-modeling and forecasting framework for exploring the complex stochastic
dependencies (both nonlinear and non-normal) between the fuel economy gaps of
vehicles reported by the same person. While the EPA label estimates are similar
to the average numbers reported by website customers, significant, non-linear
variation exists in the fuel economy gaps for the two vehicles across the
sample. In particular, a positive dependence, characterized by Student-t
copula, is observed between the fuel economy gaps of the two vehicles with
significant dependencies in the tails of the bivariate distribution; a pair in
which one vehicle achieves better (worse) fuel economy is likely to contain a
second vehicle getting better (worse) fuel economy as well. However, the
results also suggest that the strength of overall association is weak (Kendall
Tau = 0.28). This implies a lack of compelling agreement between fuel economy
gaps which could weaken consumers confidence in making relative comparisons
among vehicles.

features, such as buildings or businesses, that are more difficult to
disambiguate than names referring to larger places, for example cities or
natural geographic features. Fine-grained places are often significantly more
frequent and more similar to each other, and disambiguation heuristics
developed for larger places, such as those based on population or containment
relationships, are often not applicable in these cases. In this research, we
address the disambiguation of fine-grained place names from everyday place
descriptions. For this purpose, we evaluate the performance of different
existing clustering-based approaches, since clustering approaches require no
more knowledge other than the locations of ambiguous place names. We consider
not only approaches developed specifically for place name disambiguation, but
also clustering algorithms developed for general data mining that could
potentially be leveraged. We compare these methods with a novel algorithm, and
show that the novel algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in terms of
disambiguation precision and distance error over several tested datasets.

lithography simulation results. For instance, conventional DFM rule scoring
methodologies usually use rule-based techniques to compute scores without
considering neighboring geometric scenarios of targeted layout shapes. That can

mantissa-quantization and exponent-quantization. In the mantissa-quantization
stage, EOFP-QNN learns how to quantize the mantissa bits of the model
parameters while preserving the regression accuracy using the least mantissa
precision. In the exponent-quantization stage, the exponent part of the
parameters is further quantized without causing any additional performance
degradation. We evaluated the proposed EOFP quantization technique on two types
of neural networks, namely, bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and
fully convolutional neural network (FCN), on a speech enhancement task.
Experimental results showed that the model sizes can be significantly reduced
(the model sizes of the quantized BLSTM and FCN models were only 18.75% and
21.89%, respectively, compared to those of the original models) while
maintaining satisfactory speech-enhancement performance.

case-control design collected through the FHWA Motorcycle Crash Causation
Study. In particular, 351 cases (motorcyclists involved in injury crashes) are
analyzed vis-a-vis similarly-at-risk 702 matched controls (motorcyclists not
involved in crashes). The paper presents a novel heterogeneity based
statistical analysis that accounts for the possibility of both within and
between matched case-control variations. Overall, the correlations between key
risk factors and injury crash propensity exhibit significant observed and
unobserved heterogeneity. The results of best-fit random parameters logit model
with heterogeneity-in-means show that riders with partial helmet coverage have
a significantly lower risk of injury crash involvement. Lack of motorcycle
rider conspicuity captured by dark (red) upper body clothing is associated with
significantly higher injury crash risk (odds ratio 3.87). Importantly, a rider
motorcycle-oriented lower clothing significantly lowers the odds of injury
crash involvement. Formal motorcycle driving training in recent years was
associated with lower injury crash propensity. Finally, riders with less sleep
prior to crash/interview exhibited 1.97 times higher odds of crash involvement.
Methodologically, the correlations of several rider, exposure, apparel, and
riding history related factors with crash risk do not only vary in magnitude
but in direction as well. The study results indicate the need to develop
appropriate countermeasures, such as refresher motorcycle training courses,
prevention of sleep-deprived/fatigued riding, and riding under the influence of

being driven. Extreme longitudinal variations signify hard acceleration or
braking. Warnings and alerts given to drivers can reduce such volatility
potentially improving safety, energy use, and emissions. This study develops a
fundamental understanding of instantaneous driving decisions, needed for hazard
anticipation and notification systems, and distinguishes normal from anomalous
driving. In this study, driving task is divided into distinct yet unobserved
regimes. The research issue is to characterize and quantify these regimes in
typical driving cycles and the associated volatility of each regime, explore
when the regimes change and the key correlates associated with each regime.
Using Basic Safety Message (BSM) data from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment in
Ann Arbor, Michigan, two- and three-regime Dynamic Markov switching models are
estimated for several trips undertaken on various roadway types. While
thousands of instrumented vehicles with V2V and V2I communication systems are
being tested, nearly 1.4 million records of BSMs, from 184 trips undertaken by
71 instrumented vehicles are analyzed in this study. Then even more detailed
analysis of 43 randomly chosen trips (N = 714,340 BSM records) that were
undertaken on various roadway types is conducted. The results indicate that
acceleration and deceleration are two distinct regimes, and as compared to
acceleration, drivers decelerate at higher rates, and braking is significantly
more volatile than acceleration. Different correlations of the two regimes with
instantaneous driving contexts are explored. With a more generic three-regime
model specification, the results reveal high-rate acceleration, high-rate
deceleration, and cruise/constant as the three distinct regimes that
characterize a typical driving cycle. (Continued)

Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems by integrating all the information that

proposed a patch based multi-input CNN that learns symmetrical difference to

without symmetry context using Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Competition

confidence interval of [0.920, 0.954] was obtained when symmetry information is
incorporated in comparison with baseline architecture which yielded AUC value
of 0.929 with [0.919, 0.947] confidence interval. By incorporating symmetrical
information, although there was no a significant candidate level performance
again (p = 0.111), we have found a compelling result at exam level with CPM

The last model can also be called the extremal space-time film one because of
the specific form of the appropriate variational principle. Gravitational
interaction is considered in the context of unification for all interactions of
material particles. It is shown that long-range interaction of solitons of the

magnetic moments of nanomagnets, thus allowing for new consumer-oriented
devices to be designed. Of particular interest here are tuneable
radio-frequency (RF) oscillators for wireless communication. Currently, the
structure that maximizes the output power is an Fe/MgO/Fe-type magnetic tunnel
junction (MTJ) with a fixed layer magnetized in the plane of the layers and a
free layer magnetized perpendicular to the plane. This structure allows for
most of the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) to be converted into output power.
Here, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate that the main mechanism
sustaining steady-state precession in such structures is the angular dependence
of the magnetoresistance. The TMR of such devices is known to exhibit a
broken-linear dependence versus the applied bias. Our results show that the TMR
bias dependence effectively quenches spin-transfer-driven precession and
introduces a non-monotonic frequency dependence at high applied currents. Thus
we expect the bias dependence of the TMR to have an even more dramatic effect
in MTJs with Mn-Ga-based free layers, which could be used to design wireless
oscillators extending towards the THz gap, but have been experimentally shown
to exhibit a non-trivial TMR bias dependence.

  2018","10.1002/zamm.201700372",,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The nucleotides ATP and ADP regulate many aspects of endothelial cell (EC)
biology, including intracellular calcium concentrations, focal adhesion
activation, cytoskeletal organization, and cellular motility. In vivo, ECs are
constantly under flow, and the concentration of ATP/ADP on the EC surface is
determined by the combined effects of nucleotide convective and diffusive
transport as well as hydrolysis by ectonucleotidases on the EC surface. In
addition, experiments have demonstrated that flow induces ATP release from the
cells. Previously computational models have incorporated the above effects and
thus described concentration at the EC surface. However, it remains unclear
what physical processes are responsible for nucleotide regulation. While some
EC responses to flow have been shown to be directly driven by shear stress,
others appear to also involve a non-negligible contribution of transport. In
the present work, we develop a mathematical model and perform numerical
simulations to investigate the relative contributions of shear stress and
transport to nucleotide concentration at the EC surface, with the effect of
cell density. Because in vitro experiments are performed by using confluent
cells in some cases and subconfluent cells in other cases, we also investigate
the effect of cell density on the results. The outcomes of the simulations
demonstrate a complex interplay between shear stress and transport such that
transport has a significant contribution at certain shear stress values but not
at others. The effect of transport on nucleotide concentration increases with
cell density. The present findings enhance our understanding of the mechanisms
that govern the regulation of such molecules at the EC surface under flow. The
implications of these findings for downstream responses such as cellular
motility merit future investigation.

economy growth, innovation and society development. However, there is still
insufficient understanding about startups, particularly, how to start a new
business in the relation to consequent performance. Toward this knowledge, we
have performed an empirical study regarding the differences between a Resource
and Competence View (Internal) vs Environment and Market View (External) when
defining a Business. 701 entrepreneurs have reflected on their startups on nine
classes of Resources (values, vision, personal objectives, employees and
partners, buildings and rental contracts, cash and credit, patents, IPR's and
brands, products and services and finally revenues and grants) and three
elements of the Business Mission (""KeyContribution"", ""KeyMarket"" and
""Distinction""). It seems to be a tendency to favour the Internal View over the
External View. This tendency is clearer in Stable Economies (Europe) than in
Emerging Economies (South Africa). There seems to be a co-variation between the
tendency to favour the Internal View and the tendency to focus on adding
Resources. Finally, we found that an order-based analysis seems to explain the
differences between the two views better than a number-based method.

applications require integrated and voltage-efficient modulator solutions with
compact formfactors that are seamlessly integratable with Silicon photonics
platforms and feature near-CMOS material processing synergies. However,
existing integrated modulators are challenged to meet these requirements.
Conversely, emerging electro-optic materials heterogeneously integrated with Si
photonics open a new avenue for device engineering. Indium tin oxide (ITO) is
one such compelling material for heterogeneous integration in Si exhibiting
formidable electro-optic effect characterized by unity order index at
telecommunication frequencies. Here we overcome these limitations and
demonstrate a monolithically integrated ITO electro- optic modulator based on a
Mach Zehnder interferometer (MZI) featuring a high-performance half-wave
voltage and active device length product, VpL = 0.52 V-mm. We show, how that
the unity-strong index change enables a 30 micrometer-short pi-phase shifter
