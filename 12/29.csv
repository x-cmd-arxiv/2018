laboratory add complexity to the management of Cardiology and in-patient
department. In this article, we sought to study the behavior of cardiology
admissions from Catheterization laboratory using time series models. Our
research involves retrospective cardiology admission data from March 1, 2012,
to November 3, 2016, retrieved from a hospital in Iowa. Autoregressive
integrated moving average (ARIMA), Holts method, mean method, na\""ive method,
seasonal na\""ive, exponential smoothing, and drift method were implemented to
forecast weekly cardiology admissions from Catheterization laboratory. ARIMA
(2,0,2) (1,1,1) was selected as the best fit model with the minimum sum of
error, Akaike information criterion and Schwartz Bayesian criterion. The model
failed to reject the null hypothesis of stationarity, it lacked the evidence of
independence, and rejected the null hypothesis of normality. The implication of
this study will not only improve catheterization laboratory staff schedule,
advocate efficient use of imaging equipment and inpatient telemetry beds but
also equip management to proactively tackle inpatient overcrowding, plan for
physical capacity expansion and so forth.

  Predictive Analytics: Preponing Prior Health Insurance Authorization Thus
  Reducing the Inpatient Length of Stay",,,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: A patient medical insurance coverage plays an essential role in
determining the post-acute care (PAC) discharge disposition. The prior health
insurance authorization process postpones the PAC discharge disposition,
increases the inpatient length of stay, and effects patient health. Our study
implements predictive analytics for the early prediction of the PAC discharge
disposition to reduce the deferments caused by prior health insurance
authorization, the inpatient length of stay and inpatient stay expenses.
Methodology: We conducted a group discussion involving 25 patient care
facilitators (PCFs) and two registered nurses (RNs) and retrieved 1600 patient
data records from the initial nursing assessment and discharge notes to conduct
a retrospective analysis of PAC discharge dispositions using predictive
analytics. Results: The chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID)
algorithm enabled the early prediction of the PAC discharge disposition,
accelerated the prior health insurance process, decreased the inpatient length
of stay by an average of 22.22%, and reduced inpatient stay expenses by \$1,974
for state government hospitals, \$2,346 for non-profit hospitals and \$1,798
for for-profit hospitals per day. The CHAID algorithm produced an overall
accuracy of 84.16% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve value of 0.81. Conclusion: The early prediction of PAC discharge
dispositions can condense the PAC deferment caused by the prior health
insurance authorization process and simultaneously minimize the inpatient
length of stay and related expenses incurred by the hospital.

decay channel $n\to n' X$ into mirror neutron $n'$, its nearly mass degenerate
twin from parallel dark sector, and a massless boson $X$ which can be ordinary
and mirror photons or some more exotic particle. Such an invisible decay could
alleviate the tension between the neutron lifetimes measured in the beam and
trap experiments. I discuss some phenomenological and astrophysical
consequences of this scenario, which depends on the mass range of mirror
neutron $n'$. Namely, the case $m_{n'} < m_p + m_e$ leads to a striking
possibility is that the hydrogen atom $^1$H (protium), constituting 75 per cent
of the baryon mass in the Universe, could in fact be unstable: it can decay via
the electron capture into $n'$ and $\nu_e$, with relatively short lifetime
$\sim 10^{21}$ yr or so. If instead $m_{n'} > m_p + m_e$, then the decay $n'\to
pe\bar \nu_e$ is allowed and $n'$ can represent an unstable dark matter
component with rather large lifetime exceeding the age of the Universe.
Nevertheless, this decay would produce substantial diffuse gamma background.
The dark decay explanation of the lifetime puzzle, however, has a tension with
the last experimental results measuring $\beta$-asymmetry in the neutron decay.

applications. However, in practice, we often have limited data on the true
predictive task of interest, and must instead rely on more abundant data on a
closely-related proxy predictive task. For example, e-commerce platforms use
abundant customer click data (proxy) to make product recommendations rather
than the relatively sparse customer purchase data (true outcome of interest);
alternatively, hospitals often rely on medical risk scores trained on a
different patient population (proxy) rather than their own patient population
(true cohort of interest) to assign interventions. Yet, not accounting for the
bias in the proxy can lead to sub-optimal decisions. Using real datasets, we
find that this bias can often be captured by a sparse function of the features.
Thus, we propose a novel two-step estimator that uses techniques from
high-dimensional statistics to efficiently combine a large amount of proxy data
and a small amount of true data. We prove upper bounds on the error of our
proposed estimator and lower bounds on several heuristics used by data
scientists; in particular, our proposed estimator can achieve the same accuracy
with exponentially less true data (in the number of features). Our proof relies
on a new LASSO tail inequality for approximately sparse vectors. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on e-commerce and healthcare
datasets; in both cases, we achieve significantly better predictive accuracy as
well as managerial insights into the nature of the bias in the proxy data.

detecting salt dome boundaries with accuracy. At the same time, our analysis

patches from different seismic sections. To accommodate noise components with
various levels in a texture tensor, we employ noise-adjusted principal
component analysis (NA-PCA), so that principal components corresponding to

contentious today. Contrasting with the usual approach to modeling human-nature
interactions, which are based on the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model with
humans as the predators and nature as the prey, here we address this issue
using a discrete-time population dynamics model of ecosystem engineers. The
growth of the population of engineers is modeled by the Beverton-Holt equation
with a density-dependent carrying capacity that is proportional to the number
of usable habitats. These habitats (e.g., farms) are the products of the work
of the individuals on the virgin habitats (e.g., native forests), hence the
denomination engineers of ecosystems to those agents. The human-made habitats
decay into degraded habitats, which eventually regenerate into virgin habitats.
For slow regeneration resources, we find that the dynamics is dominated by
cycles of prosperity and collapse, in which the population reaches vanishing
small densities. However, increase of the efficiency of the engineers to
explore the resources eliminates the dangerous cyclical patterns of feast and
famine and leads to a stable equilibrium that balances population growth and
resource availability. This finding supports the viewpoint of growth optimists
that technological progress may avoid collapse.

yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind.
Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias-variance trade-off,
appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in the modern
machine learning practice. The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model
should balance under-fitting and over-fitting: rich enough to express
underlying structure in data, simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns.
However, in the modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are
trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models
would be considered over-fit, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test
data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical
foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners.
  In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern
practice within a unified performance curve. This ""double descent"" curve
subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias-variance trade-off curve by showing how
increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved
performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double
descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism
for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of
machine learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses, and has
implications for both the theory and practice of machine learning.

properties of the Mukhanov-Sasaki Hamiltonian and, following this approach,
investigate whether we can obtain possible candidates for initial states in the
context of inflation considering a quasi-de Sitter spacetime. Our main interest
lies in the question to which extent these already well-established methods at
the classical and quantum level for finitely many degrees of freedom can be
generalized to field theory. As our results show, a straightforward
generalization does in general not lead to a unitary operator on Fock space
that implements the corresponding time-dependent canonical transformation
associated with the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant. The action of this operator can
be rewritten as a time-dependent Bogoliubov transformation and we show that its
generalization to Fock space has to be chosen appropriately in order that the
Shale-Stinespring condition is not violated, where we also compare our results
to already existing ones in the literature. Furthermore, our analysis relates
the Ermakov differential equation that plays the role of an auxiliary equation,
whose solution is necessary to construct the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant, as
well as the corresponding time-dependent canonical transformation to the
defining differential equation for adiabatic vacua. Therefore, a given solution
of the Ermakov equation directly yields a full solution to the differential
equation for adiabatic vacua involving no truncation at some adiabatic order.
As a consequence, we can interpret our result obtained here as a kind of
non-squeezed Bunch-Davies mode, where the term non-squeezed refers to a
possible residual squeezing that can be involved in the unitary operator for
certain choices of the Bogoliubov map.

account for dark matter and explain the existence of neutrino masses, which are
generated radiatively. This holds even if singlet-doublet fermions and triplet
scalars never contribute simultaneously to the dark matter abundance. However,
this also implies the existence of lepton flavour violating processes. In
addition, this particular model allows for gauge coupling unification. The new
fields are odd under a new $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry to stabilise the dark matter
candidate. We analyse the dark matter, neutrino mass and lepton flavour
violation aspects both separately and in conjunction, exploring the viable
parameter space of the model. This is done using a numerical random scan
imposing successively the neutrino mass and mixing, relic density, Higgs mass,
direct detection, collider and lepton flavour violation constraints. We find
that dark matter in this model is fermionic for masses below about 1 TeV and
scalar above. The narrow mass regions found previously for the two separate
models are enlarged by their coupling. While coannihilations of the weak
isospin partners are sizeable, this is not the case for fermions and scalars
despite their often similar masses due to the relatively small coupling of the
two sectors, imposed by the small neutrino masses. We observe a high degree of
complementarity between direct detection and lepton flavour violation
experiments, which should soon allow to fully probe the fermionic dark matter

is presented. Multi-robot systems have the capacity to transform lives in a
variety of fields. But, trajectory generation for multi-robot systems is still
in its nascent stage and limited to heavily controlled environments. To
overcome that, an online trajectory optimization algorithm that generates
collision-free trajectories for robots, when given initial state and desired
end pose, is proposed. It utilizes a simple method for obstacle detection,
local shape based maps for obstacles and communication of robots' current
states. Using the local maps, safe regions are formulated. Based upon the
communicated data, trajectories are predicted for other robots and incorporated
for collision-avoidance by resizing the regions of free space that the robot
can be in without colliding. A trajectory is then optimized constraining the
robot to remain within the safe region with the trajectories represented by
piecewise polynomials parameterized by time. The algorithm is implemented using
a receding horizon principle. The proposed algorithm is extensively tested in
simulations on Gazebo using ROS with fourth order differentially flat aerial
robots and non-holonomic second order wheeled robots in structured and
unstructured environments.

(YSTZ), are a unique family of SM materials that offer unique properties
including ultra-high operating temperature, and high resistance to chemical
corrosion and oxidation. However, formation of defects is usually observed in
SM ceramics during manufacturing and/or by mechanical deformation. To fully
take advantage of the SM properties of these ceramics, it is necessary to fully
understand the nano-structural evolution of defects under external stimuli. In
this study, defect closure behaviors in YSTZ nanopillars are investigated by
atomistic simulations. Two characteristic orientations of [011-] and [001] are
selected to represent the dominant deformation mechanisms of phase
transformation and dislocation migration, respectively. With the presence of
crack and void, the strength and yield strain of nanopillars are noted to
decrease significantly, especially for [011-]-oriented YSTZ nanopillars. Volume
expansion associated with the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation is
observed to promote healing of crack and void. Atom stress analyses reveal
stress concentrations along the newly formed monoclinic phase bands. A critical
crack width is identified, less than which the crack can be fully closed in
compression. Size effect study reveals that an increase in nanopillar size has
a positive effect on crack self-healing behavior. For [001]-oriented YSTZ
nanopillars, dislocation migration leads to formations of an amorphous phase,
which also assist the crack and void closure process. The revealed crack/void
healing mechanisms may provide a path for mitigating internal defects that
influences the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of SM ceramics.

Their slow convergence due to very high variance, and the fact that, for the

only in special cases. First we show that the gradients of these value
functions admit a representation that lends itself to algorithm design. Based
on this result, a new class of differential TD-learning algorithms is

intergranular deformations including grain boundary sliding and migration,

Results also reveal formation of partial dislocations, which act as splitters
of large grains and play a significant role in facilitating the rotation of
grains, and consequently promote amorphous-to-crystalline phase transition
in-between neighboring grains. An increase in free surface-to-volume ratio is
found to be responsible for specimen size-induced softening phenomenon, where a
decrease in Young modulus and strength is observed when the specimen width
decreases from 30 nm to 10 nm. Also, a decrease in Young modulus and strength
is revealed with the decrease of average grain size from 15 nm to 5 nm. Grain
boundary density is identified to be responsible for the observed grain
size-induced softening behavior in polycrystalline YSTZ nanopillars. A
transition in dominant deformation mechanism is observed from amorphous phase
formation at grain boundaries to a competition between intergranular grain

diverse target images to represent the style in the target domain. Unlike
existing methods which require a large amount of unlabeled target data, our
method can work with as few as ten unlabeled images. We evaluate it on a number

broad range of parameters, the Majoron decays to neutrinos at late times, after
the cosmic neutrinos have decoupled from the thermal bath, resulting in a
secondary contribution to the cosmic neutrino background. We determine the
current bounds on this scenario, and explore the possibility of directly
detecting this secondary cosmic neutrino background in experiments based on
neutrino capture on nuclei. For Majoron masses in the eV range or below, the
neutrino flux from these decays can be comparable to that from the primary
cosmic neutrino background, making it a promising target for direct detection
experiments. The neutrinos from Majoron decay are redshifted by the cosmic
expansion, and exhibit a characteristic energy spectrum that depends on both
the Majoron mass and its lifetime. For Majoron lifetimes of order the age of
the universe or larger, there is also a monochromatic contribution to the
neutrino flux from Majoron decays in the Milky Way that can be comparable to
the diffuse extragalactic flux. We find that for Majoron masses in the eV
range, direct detection experiments based on neutrino capture on tritium, such
as PTOLEMY, will be sensitive to this scenario with 100 gram-years of data. In
the event of a signal, the galactic and extragalactic components can be
distinguished on the basis of their distinct energy distributions, and also by

employ the method of canonical variational completion to show that Rutz

the mathematical rigor in the derivation of the Finsler gravity field equation,
we formulate the Finsler gravity action on the positive projective tangent

variational principle, by choosing the domains of integration to be compact and
independent of the dynamical variable. In particular in the pseudo-Riemannian

multimedia-intensive world, in order to assess the visual quality of an image
at close to a human level of ability. Many~parameters such as color intensity,
structure, sharpness, contrast, presence of an object, etc., draw human
attention to an image. Psychological vision research suggests that human vision
is biased to the center area of an image and display screen. As a result, if
the center part contains any visually salient information, it draws human
attention even more and any distortion in that part will be better perceived
than other parts. To the best of our knowledge, previous IQA methods have not
considered this fact. In this paper, we propose a full reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA) approach using visual saliency and contrast; however, we
give extra attention to the center by increasing the sensitivity of the
similarity maps in that region. We evaluated our method on three large-scale
popular benchmark databases used by most of the current IQA researchers
(TID2008, CSIQ~and LIVE), having a total of 3345 distorted images with
28~different kinds of distortions. Our~method is compared with 13
state-of-the-art approaches. This comparison reveals the stronger correlation
of our method with human-evaluated values. The prediction-of-quality score is
consistent for distortion specific as well as distortion independent cases.
Moreover, faster processing makes it applicable to any real-time application.

driven by oscillating laser field collide with neutral neighbor atoms, thus
effecting the energy gain in the emerging electron gas via a short-range
inverse Bremsstrahlung interaction. These collisions also cause excitation and
impact ionization of the atoms thus reducing the electron-gas energy. A kinetic
model of these competing processes is developed which predicts the prevalence
of excited atoms over ionized atoms by the end of the laser pulse. The creation
of a significant number of excited atoms during the pulse in high-pressure
gases is consistent with the delayed ionization dynamics in the pulse wake,

In past years, various works have used diffusion MRI for automatic
classification of AD. However, classification performance obtained with
different approaches is difficult to compare and these studies are also
difficult to reproduce. In the present paper, we first extend a previously
proposed framework to diffusion MRI data for AD classification. Specifically,
we add: conversion of diffusion MRI ADNI data into the BIDS standard and
pipelines for diffusion MRI preprocessing and feature extraction. We then apply
the framework to compare different components. First, FS has a positive impact
on classification results: highest balanced accuracy (BA) improved from 0.76 to
0.82 for task CN vs AD. Secondly, voxel-wise features generally gives better
performance than regional features. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean
diffusivity (MD) provided comparable results for voxel-wise features. Moreover,
we observe that the poor performance obtained in tasks involving MCI were
potentially caused by the small data samples, rather than by the data
imbalance. Furthermore, no extensive classification difference exists for
different degree of smoothing and registration methods. Besides, we demonstrate
that using non-nested validation of FS leads to unreliable and over-optimistic
results: 0.05 up to 0.40 relative increase in BA. Lastly, with proper FR and
FS, the performance of diffusion MRI features is comparable to that of T1w MRI.

about the future, but surprisingly little is known about how to account for
uncertainty of the present: that is, the realities of having only partial or
imperfect measurements. Our primary paradigms for handling decisions under
uncertainty -- the precautionary principle and optimal control -- have so far
given contradictory results. This paradox is best illustrated in the example of
fisheries management, where many ideas that guide thinking about ecological
decision making were first developed. We find that simplistic optimal control
approaches have repeatedly concluded that a manager should increase catch
quotas when faced with greater uncertainty about the fish biomass. Current best
practices take a more precautionary approach, decreasing catch quotas by a
fixed amount to account for uncertainty. Using comparisons to both simulated
and historical catch data, we find that neither approach is sufficient to avoid
stock collapses under moderate observational uncertainty. Using partially
observed Markov decision process (POMDP) methods, we demonstrate how this
paradox arises from flaws in the standard theory, which contributes to
over-exploitation of fisheries and increased probability of economic and
ecological collapse. In contrast, we find POMDP-based management avoids such
over-exploitation while also generating higher economic value. These results
have significant implications for how we handle uncertainty in both fisheries

dimensions. We check residue-theorem identities among color-dressed leading
singularities in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to
demonstrate the absence of poles at infinity of all MHV amplitudes through
three loops. Considering the same test for $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity leads
us to discover that this theory does support non-vanishing residues at infinity
starting at two loops, and the degree of these poles grow arbitrarily with
multiplicity. This causes a tension between simultaneously manifesting
ultraviolet finiteness---which would be automatic in a representation obtained
by color-kinematic duality---and gauge invariance---which would follow from
unitarity-based methods.

decay constants $f_a \simeq \mathcal{O}(10^{16}-10^{17})$ GeV, to which
experimental proposals are dedicated. This regime is known to face the problem
of overproduction of axion dark matter from the misalignment mechanism unless
the misalignment angle $\theta_{\rm mis}$ is as small as
$\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}-10^{-4})$, which is generally considered a fine-tuning
problem. We investigate a dynamical explanation for a small $\theta_{\rm mis}$.
The axion mass arises from strong dynamics and may be sufficiently enhanced by
early dynamics so as to overcome Hubble friction and drive the field value to
the bottom of the potential long before the QCD phase transition. Together with
an approximate CP symmetry in the theory, this minimum is very closely related
to today's value and thus $\theta_{\rm mis}$ can automatically be well under
unity. Owing to such efficient relaxation, the isocurvature perturbations are
essentially damped. As an existence proof, using supersymmetric theories we
illustrate that the Higgs coupling with the inflaton energy can successfully
achieve this axion damping in a consistent inflationary cosmology.

remarkable properties such as the existence of Schwarzschild-like non-hairy

kinematics of the Milky Way disk. Of particular interest is the presence of
ridges covering the stellar velocity distribution, $V_{\phi}-R$; as shown by
others, it is likely that these ridges are the signature of phase mixing,
transient spirals, or the bar. Here, with a Galactic model containing both: bar
and spirals, we found the same pattern of ridges extending from the inner to
the outer disk. Interestingly, ridges in the $V_{\phi}-R$ plane correlate
extremely well with wiggles in the computed rotation curve (RC). Hence,
although the DR2 reveals (for the first time) such substructures in a wide
spatial coverage, we notice that we have always seen such pattern of ridges,
but projected into the form of wiggles in the RC. The separation and amplitude
of the wiggles strongly depend on the extension and layout of ridges in the
$V_{\phi}-R$ plane. This means that within the RC are encoded the kinematic
state of the disk as well as information about the bar and spiral arms. The
amplitude of the wiggles suggests that similar features currently observable in
external galaxies RCs have similar origins, triggered by spirals and bars.

$\theta_{\rm mis} \simeq \mathcal{O}(1)$. While $f_a \ll 10^{12}$ GeV is of
great experimental interest, the misalignment mechanism requires the axion to
be very close to the hilltop, i.e. $\theta_{\rm mis} \simeq \pi$. This
particular choice of $\theta_{\rm mis}$ has been understood as fine-tuning the
initial condition. We offer a dynamical explanation for $\theta_{\rm mis}

of the potential by virtue of an enhanced mass in the early universe. This
minimum is subsequently converted to a hilltop because the CP phase of the

with an opposite sign. We demonstrate explicit and viable examples in
supersymmetric models where the higher dimensional Higgs coupling with the

directional solidification of particle suspensions, sublimation of the
solidified fluid, and sintering of the particle walls. Most ice-templating
studies utilize upward solidification techniques, where solid ice is located at
the bottom of the solidification mold, the liquid suspension is on top of the
ice, and the solidification front advances upward, against gravity. Liquid
water reaches its maximum density at 4{\deg}C; thus, liquid nearest the cold
source is less dense than warmer liquid above. The lower density liquid nearest
the cold source is expected to rise due to buoyancy, promoting convective fluid
motion during solidification. Here, we investigate the effect of solidification
direction with respect to the direction of gravity on ice-templated
microstructures to study the role of buoyancy-driven fluid motion during
solidification. We hypothesize that, for upward solidification, the convective
fluid motion that results from a liquid density gradient occurs near the
solidification front. For downward solidification, we expect that this fluid
motion occurs farther away from the solidification front. Aqueous suspensions
of TiO2 nanoparticles are solidified upward (against gravity, with ice on
bottom and water on top), downward (water on bottom, ice on top), and
horizontally (perpendicular to gravity). Microstructural investigation of
sintered samples shows evidence of buoyancy-driven, convective fluid flow
during solidification for samples solidified upwards (against gravity),
including tilting of the wall (and pore) orientation with respect to the
induced temperature gradient, ice lens defects, and radial macrosegregation.
These features are not observed for downward nor horizontal solidification
configurations.

exponential growth we are experiencing in the Internet of Things (IoT) space,
with more pervasive computations being performed near to data generation
sources. A range of intelligent devices and applications performing local
detection is emerging (activity recognition, fitness monitoring, etc.) bringing
with them obvious advantages such as reducing detection latency for improved
interaction with devices and safeguarding user data by not leaving the device.
Video processing holds utility for many emerging applications and data
labelling in the IoT space. However, performing this video processing with deep
neural networks at the edge of the Internet is not trivial. In this paper we
show that pedestrian location estimation using deep neural networks is
achievable on fixed cameras with limited compute resources. Our approach uses
pose estimation from key body points detection to extend pedestrian skeleton
when whole body not in image (occluded by obstacles or partially outside of
frame), which achieves better location estimation performance (infrence time
and memory footprint) compared to fitting a bounding box over pedestrian and
scaling. We collect a sizable dataset comprising of over 2100 frames in videos
from one and two surveillance cameras pointing from different angles at the
scene, and annotate each frame with the exact position of person in image, in
42 different scenarios of activity and occlusion. We compare our pose
estimation based location detection with a popular detection algorithm, YOLOv2,
for overlapping bounding-box generation, our solution achieving faster
inference time (15x speedup) at half the memory footprint, within resource
capabilities on embedded devices, which demonstrate that CamLoc is an efficient
solution for location estimation in videos on smart-cameras.

properties at fixed halo mass, could be an important ingredient in halo-based
modelling of galaxy clustering. We investigate the central galaxy assembly bias
by studying the relation between various galaxy and halo properties in the
Illustris hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulation. Galaxy stellar mass
$\Mstar$ is found to have a tighter correlation with peak maximum halo circular
velocity $\Vp$ than with halo mass $\Mh$. Once the correlation with $\Vp$ is
accounted for, $\Mstar$ has nearly no dependence on any other halo assembly
variables. The correlations between galaxy properties related to star formation
history and halo assembly properties also show a cleaner form as a function of
$\Vp$ than as a function of $\Mh$, with the main correlation being with halo
formation time and to a less extent halo concentration. Based on the
galaxy-halo relation, we present a simple model to relate the bias factors of a
central galaxy sample and the corresponding halo sample, both selected based on
assembly-related properties. It is found that they are connected by the
correlation coefficient of the galaxy and halo properties used to define the
two samples, which provides a reasonable description for the samples in the
simulation and suggests a simple prescription to incorporate galaxy assembly
bias into the halo model. By applying the model to the local galaxy clustering
measurements in Lin et al. (2016), we infer that the correlation between star
formation history or specific star formation rate and halo formation time is
consistent with being weak.

  charged particle data","PhD thesis, 167 pages",,,,"physics.space-ph astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Remote sensing observations indicate that Europa is surrounded by a tenuous
atmosphere. Furthermore, recent observations and historic data from Galileo
hint at the occurrence of water vapour eruptions originating from the interior
that create 200 km high plumes. Due to the lack of adequate measurements large
uncertainties exist in the properties of Europa's atmosphere (e.g. loss rate
and structure) and plumes (e.g. structure, source location, duration), of the
latter one the existence is not even confirmed. Unexploited opportunities to
constrain properties of the atmosphere or plumes remain in the in-situ data
collected by the Galileo mission, the only mission that has surveyed Europa
from close by. In this thesis, I investigate how to constrain the properties
(density, scale height) of Europa's tenuous atmosphere and plumes, using data
from the Galileo in-situ particle detector instruments (PLS, EPD). I simulate
the depletion of energetic protons and oxygen ions measured during the E12
flyby. A Monte Carlo particle tracing method is used to simulate the particle
trajectories and determine where they are depleted: at the surface or in the
atmosphere. The simulations show that the depletions of energetic ions observed
in the range 80 to 540 keV can be explained by charge exchange with neutral
atmospheric particles, but not by impact on the surface alone. This suggests
that an atmosphere must have been present during the E12 flyby. The simulations
best represent the sublimated component of the atmosphere and favour higher
surface densities than the literature, but are not sensitive to the scale
height. Furthermore, an additional depletion is visible very briefly in the
energetic protons with energies from 540 to 1040 keV. This feature could be
consistent with localized losses from a Europa plume, although such a solution
is not unique.

This continuum formulation draws a link between computational fluid dynamics

estimate for the spatial discretization, which favorably distinguishes the
formulation from the conventional mixed formulations for finite elasticity. The
inf-sup condition is utilized to provide a bound for the pressure field. The
generalized-$\alpha$ method is applied for temporal discretization, and a
nested block preconditioner is invoked for the solution procedure. The inf-sup
stability for different pairs of NURBS elements is elucidated through numerical
assessment. The convergence rate of the proposed formulation with various
combinations of mixed elements is examined by the manufactured solution method.
The numerical scheme is also examined under compressive and tensile loads for
isotropic and anisotropic hyperelastic materials. Finally, a suite of dynamic
problems is numerically studied to corroborate the stability and conservation
properties.

significant deviations from the classical BET isotherms for multimolecular
adsorption of vapor in porous solids. Since the point of transition from free

(or humidity) decreases, the area of the surface of multimolecular adsorption
layer exposed to vapor gets modified by an area reduction factor that decreases
with increasing thickness of the layer, and thus also with increasing vapor
pressure. The area reduction factor does not affect the rates of direct
adsorption or condensation from the vapor, which represent a local process, but
imposes a lateral constraint on the total area and volume of the free portion
of the adsorption layer in direct contact with vapor. Assuming a power-law for
the dependence of the area reduction factor on the number of molecular layers,
one can express the modified isotherm in terms of logarithmic or
polylogarithmic (a.k.a Jonqui\`ere) functions. Comparisons with some published
experimentally obtained isotherms show that the present modification of the BET
theory for hindered adsorption goes in the right direction. Detailed
calibration of the theory and an extension for indirect communication of vapor

non-dissipative compact finite differences for plasma flows in several

The accuracy and robustness of this two-fluid plasma solver in handling plasma

magnetic reconnection. For all test cases, by using physical dissipation and
diffusion, with negligible numerical dissipation/diffusion, fully converged

Reynolds number based on grid size is smaller than a threshold value which is
about 2.3 in this study. For the magnetic reconnection problem, the results

must exceed the product of the temperature and the change in Shannon entropy of
the information-bearing degrees of freedom. However, this lower bound is
achievable only for quasistatic, near-equilibrium computations -- that is, only
over infinite time. In practice, information processing takes place in finite
time, resulting in dissipation and potentially unreliable logical outcomes. For
overdamped Langevin dynamics, we show that counterdiabatic potentials can be
crafted to guide systems rapidly and accurately along desired computational
paths, providing shortcuts that allows for the precise design of finite-time
computations. Such shortcuts require additional work, beyond Landauer's bound,
that is irretrievably dissipated into the environment. We show that this
dissipated work is proportional to the computation rate as well as the square
of the information-storing system's length scale. As a paradigmatic example, we
design shortcuts to erase a bit of information metastably stored in a
double-well potential. Though dissipated work generally increases with erasure
fidelity, we show that it is possible perform perfect erasure in finite time
with finite work. We also show that the robustness of information storage
affects the energetic cost of erasure---specifically, the dissipated work
scales as the information lifetime of the bistable system. Our analysis exposes
a rich and nuanced relationship between work, speed, size of the

process. The DM surrounds a benchmark model that he or she fears is
misspecified by a set of models. Decisions are evaluated under a worst-case
model delivering the lowest utility among all models in this set. The DM's
benchmark model and preference parameters are jointly underidentified. With the
benchmark model held fixed, primitive conditions are established for
identification of the DM's worst-case model and preference parameters. The key
step in the identification analysis is to establish existence and uniqueness of
the DM's continuation value function allowing for unbounded statespace and
unbounded utilities. To do so, fixed-point results are derived for monotone,
convex operators that act on a Banach space of thin-tailed functions arising
naturally from the structure of the continuation value recursion. The
fixed-point results are quite general; applications to models with learning and
Rust-type dynamic discrete choice models are also discussed. For estimation, a
perturbation result is derived which provides a necessary and sufficient
condition for consistent estimation of continuation values and the worst-case
model. The result also allows convergence rates of estimators to be
characterized. An empirical application studies an endowment economy where the
DM's benchmark model may be interpreted as an aggregate of experts' forecasting
models. The application reveals time-variation in the way the DM
pessimistically distorts benchmark probabilities. Consequences for asset

mass $m\sim 10^{-7}M_\odot$, which helps explain the gamma-ray burst from
GW170817. One ejection mechanism is the ablation of the neutron star surface by
the burst of neutrinos in the first $30\,\mu$s of the merger. Another, more
efficient, mechanism for inflating the ultra-relativistic envelope is an
internal shock in the massive ejecta from the merger. A strong shock is
expected if the merger product is a magnetar, which emits a centrifugally
accelerated wind. The shock propagates outward through the ejecta and
accelerates in its outer layers at radii $r\sim 10^9-10^{10}$cm, launching an
ultra-relativistic opaque envelope filled with $\sim 10^4$ photons per nucleon.
The Lorentz factor profile of the envelope rises outward and determines its
homologous expansion, which adiabatically cools the trapped photons. Once the
magnetar loses its differential rotation and collapses into a black hole, a
powerful jet forms. It drives a blast wave into the envelope, chasing its outer
layers and eventually catching up with the envelope photosphere at $r\sim
10^{12}$cm. The ultra-relativistic photospheric breakout of the delayed blast
wave emits a gamma-ray burst in a broad solid angle around the merger axis.
This model explains the gamma-ray pulse from merger GW170817 with luminosity
$L_\gamma\sim 10^{47}$erg/s, duration $\Delta t_{\rm obs}\sim 0.5$s, and
characteristic photon energy $\sim 100$keV. The blast wave Lorentz factor at

phenomenon is related to the weak binding of these nuclei, the origin of this

provides the complete fusion for weakly bound nuclei and relates its
suppression to the competition between the different mechanisms contributing to
the reaction cross section. The method is applied to the $^{6,7}$Li+$^{209}$Bi
reactions, where we find that the suppression of complete fusion is mostly
caused by the flux associated with non-elastic breakup modes, such as the
partial capture of the projectile (incomplete fusion), whereas the elastic
breakup mode is found to play a minor role. Finally, we demonstrate that the
large $\alpha$ yields observed in these reactions can be naturally explained as
a consequence of a {\it Trojan Horse} mechanism.

snap-round the points of each diagram to points on a cubical lattice and
produce a key for each possible snap-rounding. Specifically, we fix a grid over

generate pseudo documents for model pre-training, and then performs
self-training on real unlabeled data to iteratively refine the model. During

shows an anomalous ellipticity dependence, similar to that observed
experimentally in the single-crystal MgO. With the help of a semiclassical
analysis, it is found that the key mechanism inducing the change of ellipticity
dependence is the interplay between the dynamical Bloch oscillation and the
anisotropic band structure. The dynamical Bloch oscillation contributes
additional quantum paths, which are less sensitive to ellipticity. The
anisotropic band-structure make the driving pulse with finite ellipticity be
able to drive the pairs to the band positions with larger gap, which extends
the harmonic cutoff. The combination of these two effects leads to the
anomalous ellipticity dependence. The result reveals the importance of

regions that are most important to decision-making by backpropagating gradients
from the attention module to the input frames. The incorporation of our

power consumption is an important issue in wireless access networks. As both
power budget in wireless access networks and bandwidth of fiber backhaul are

rendered absolutely stable if VLFs are present with certain parameters. For
other values of VLF parameters, the Higgs vacuum is metastable as in the

probability of quantum tunneling from the false electroweak vacuum into a
deeper true vacuum in our Hubble volume by numerically solving for the bounce

computer vision. The current trend is to solve this problem globally using the
BnB optimization framework. However, the existing global methods are slow for
two main reasons: the computational complexity of BnB is exponential to the
problem dimensionality (which is six for 3D rigid registration), and the bound
evaluation used in BnB is inefficient. In this paper, we propose two techniques
to address these problems. First, we introduce the idea of translation
invariant vectors, which allows us to decompose the search of a 6D rigid
transformation into a search of 3D rotation followed by a search of 3D
translation, each of which is solved by a separate BnB algorithm. This
transformation decomposition reduces the problem dimensionality of BnB
algorithms and substantially improves its efficiency. Then, we propose a new
data structure, named 3D Integral Volume, to accelerate the bound evaluation in
both BnB algorithms. By combining these two techniques, we implement an
efficient algorithm for rigid registration of 3D point sets. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed algorithm is
three orders of magnitude faster than the existing state-of-the-art global
methods.

without unduly impacting planner performance. This paper introduces a
minimally-interventional safety controller operating within an autonomous
vehicle control stack with the role of ensuring collision-free interaction with
an externally controlled (e.g., human-driven) counterpart. We leverage
reachability analysis to construct a real-time (100Hz) controller that serves
the dual role of (1) tracking an input trajectory from a higher-level planning
algorithm using model predictive control, and (2) assuring safety through
maintaining the availability of a collision-free escape maneuver as a
persistent constraint regardless of whatever future actions the other car
takes. A full-scale steer-by-wire platform is used to conduct traffic weaving
experiments wherein the two cars, initially side-by-side, must swap lanes in a
limited amount of time and distance, emulating cars merging onto/off of a
highway. We demonstrate that, with our control stack, the autonomous vehicle is
able to avoid collision even when the other car defies the planner's
expectations and takes dangerous actions, either carelessly or with the intent
to collide, and otherwise deviates minimally from the planned trajectory to the
extent required to maintain safety.

power of other classes. In this paper, we design a novel loss function, namely
support vector guided softmax loss (SV-Softmax), which adaptively emphasizes
the mis-classified points (support vectors) to guide the discriminative
features learning. So the developed SV-Softmax loss is able to eliminate the
ambiguity of hard examples as well as absorb the discriminative power of other
classes, and thus results in more discrimiantive features. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to inherit the advantages of mining-based
and margin-based losses into one framework. Experimental results on several
benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach over
state-of-the-arts.

electroluminescence can be realized by adopting a combined strategy of both
efficient electronic decoupling and nanocavity plasmonic enhancement. The
emission intensity, upon optimized material combination for the molecule,
spacer, tip, and substrate, can be strong and stable enough for performing
second-order photon correlation measurements. The observation of an evident
photon antibunching effect demonstrates clearly the nature of single-photon
emission for single-molecule electroluminescence. Strikingly, the spectral peak
of a monomer is found to split when a molecular dimer is artificially
constructed through STM manipulation, which suggests that the excitation energy
from tunneling electrons is likely to rapidly delocalize over the whole
molecular dimer. The spatial distribution of the excitonic coupling for
different energy states in a dimer can be visualized in real space through
sub-nanometer resolved electroluminescence imaging technique, which correlates
very well with the local optical responses predicted in terms of coherent
intermolecular dipole-dipole coupling. Furthermore, a single molecule can also
couple coherently with a plasmonic nanocavity, resulting in the occurrence of
interference-induced Fano resonance. These findings open up new avenues to
fabricate electrically driven quantum light sources as well as to study
intermolecular energy transfer, field-matter interaction, and molecular

GW170817 obtained with NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory following the 17 August
2017 detection of the event by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave
Observatory (LIGO). Motivated by understanding the emission mechanism for X-ray
light and the outcome of the merger event, we fit the Chandra data with both
non-thermal (as done previously in the literature) and thermal models. We
specifically explore thermal plasma models that would be expected from a
kilonova remnant (KNR). We reproduced the non-thermal results which were
recently published by Nynka et al. (2018). We also find that thermal
bremsstrahlung emission from hot plasma can account for the X-ray emission from
this source. Furthermore, we consider models allowing for an intrinsic
absorption from the merger event, yielding a softer power-law model photon
index than previously published, or a lower plasma temperature. We also report
on evidence for line emission, or excess above the continuum model, near 1.3
keV and 2.2 keV which sheds new light on the interpretation of the KNR and its
nucleosynthesis products. We discuss the feasibility for the KNR as the origin

(mmWave) wireless backhaul network has been widely used. However, mmWave is
easily blocked by obstacles, and how to forward the data of the blocked flows
is still a significant challenge. To ensure backhauling capacity, the quality
of service (QoS) requirements of flows should be satisfied. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of optimal scheduling to maximize the number of flows
satisfying their QoS requirements with relays exploited to overcome blockage.
To achieve a practical solution, we propose a relay-assisted and QoS aware
scheduling scheme for the backhaul networks, called RAQS. It consists of a
relay selection algorithm and a transmission scheduling algorithm. The relay
selection algorithm selects non-repeating relays with high link rates for the
blocked flows, which helps to achieve the QoS requirements of flows as soon as
possible. Then, according to the results of relay selection, the transmission
scheduling algorithm exploits concurrent transmissions to satisfy the QoS
requirements of flows as much as possible. Extensive simulations show RAQS can
effectively overcome the blockage problem, and increase the number of completed
flows and network throughput compared with other schemes. In particular, the
impact of relay selection parameter is also investigated to further guide the
relay selection.

to a Poisson point process of density $\varrho$, in the limit
$\varrho\to\infty$, $r\to0$, $\varrho r^{2}\to1$ up to time scales of order
$T=o(r^{-2}{|\log r|}^{-2})$. To our knowledge this represents the first
significant progress towards solving rigorously this problem in classical
nonequilibrium statistical physics, since the groundbreaking work of Gallavotti
(1969), Spohn (1978) and Boldrighini-Bunimovich-Sinai (1983). The novelty is
that the diffusive scaling of particle trajectory and the kinetic
(Boltzmann-Grad) limit are taken simultaneously. The main ingredients are a
coupling of the mechanical trajectory with the Markovian random flight process,
and probabilistic and geometric controls on the efficiency of this coupling.
  Similar results have been earlier obtained for the weak coupling limit of
classical and quantum random Lorentz gas, by Komorowski-Ryzhik (2006),
respectively, Erd\H os-Salmhofer-Yau (2007). However, the following are
substantial differences between our work and these ones: (1) The physical
setting is different: low density rather than weak coupling. (2)The method of
approach is different: probabilistic coupling rather than
analytic/perturbative. (3) Due to (2), the time scale of validity of our

analysis, a quantitative assessment of the uncertainties tainting the results

(estimation of high probabilities or quantiles) and quantitative sensitivity
analysis may call for several thousand of code simulations. Complex computer
codes, as the ones used in thermal-hydraulic accident scenario simulations, are
often too cpu-time expensive to be directly used to perform these studies. A
solution consists in replacing the computer model by a cpu inexpensive
mathematical function, called a metamodel, built from a reduced number of code
simulations. However, in case of high dimensional experiments (with typically
several tens of inputs), the metamodel building process remains difficult. To
face this limitation, we propose a methodology which combines several advanced
statistical tools: initial space-filling design, screening to identify the
non-influential inputs, Gaussian process (Gp) metamodel building with the group
of influential inputs as explanatory variables. The residual effect of the
group of non-influential inputs is captured by another Gp metamodel. Then, the

improve the reproduction of the experimental results, i.e. improving the
statistical fits, especially the finite pion chemical potential. This points
out to the great role that the non-equilibrium pion production would play, and
the contributions that the hadron resonance missing states come up with, even
when the principles of statistical extensivity and additivity aren't violated.

future electrical distribution systems (EDS). A multi-agent-based rolling
optimization method for EDS restoration scheduling is proposed in this paper.
When a blackout occurs, considering the risk of losing the centralized
authority due to the failure of the common core communication network, the
agents available after disasters or cyber-attacks identify the
communication-connected parts (CCPs) in the EDS with distributed communication.
A multi-time interval optimization model is formulated and solved by the agents
for the restoration scheduling of a CCP. A rolling optimization process for the
entire EDS restoration is proposed. During the scheduling/rescheduling in the
rolling process, the CCPs in the EDS are reidentified and the restoration
schedules for the CCPs are updated. Through decentralized decision-making and
rolling optimization, EDS restoration scheduling can automatically start and
periodically update itself, providing effective solutions for EDS restoration

their tendency to inflate the type I error in small sized samples. In order to
circumvent the type I error problem, we propose simple calibrations using the
$t$ distribution and bootstrapping. The two non-parametric likelihood testing
procedures, with and without those calibrations, are then compared against the
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and the Welch $t$-test. The comparisons are
implemented via extensive Monte Carlo simulations on the grounds of type I
error and power in small/medium sized samples generated from various non-normal
populations. The simulation studies clearly demonstrate that a) the $t$
calibration improves the type I error of the empirical likelihood, b) bootstrap
calibration improves the type I error of both non-parametric likelihoods, c)
the Welch $t$-test with or without bootstrap calibration attains the type I
error and produces similar levels of power with the former testing procedures,
and d) the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test produces inflated type I error while the
computation of an exact p-value is not feasible in the presence of ties with
discrete data. Further, an application to real gene expression data illustrates
the computational high cost and thus the impracticality of the non parametric
likelihoods. Overall, the Welch t-test, which is highly computationally
efficient and readily interpretable, is shown to be the best method when
testing equality of two population means.

representation and a powerful tool for analyzing non-stationary signals. The
synchrosqueezing transform (SST) is a special type of the reassignment method
which not only enhances the energy concentration of CWT in the time-frequency
plane, but also separates the components of multicomponent signals. The ""bump
wavelet"" and Morlet's wavelet are commonly used continuous wavelets for the
wavelet-based SST. There is a parameter in these wavelets which controls the
widths of the time-frequency localization window. In most literature on SST,
this parameter is a fixed positive constant. In this paper, we consider the CWT
with a time-varying parameter (called the adaptive CWT) and the corresponding
SST (called the adaptive SST) for instantaneous frequency estimation and
multicomponent signal separation. We also introduce the 2nd-order adaptive SST.
We analyze the separation conditions for non-stationary multicomponent signals
with the local approximation of linear frequency modulation mode. We derive
well-separated conditions of a multicomponent signal based on the adaptive CWT.
We propose methods to select the time-varying parameter so that the
corresponding adaptive SSTs of the components of a multicomponent signal have
sharp representations and are well-separated, and hence the components can be
recovered more accurately. We provide comparison experimental results to
demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed adaptive CWT and
adaptive SST in separating components of multicomponent signals with fast
varying frequencies.

in an automated manner the requirements of verticals into decisions concerning

traffic routing. In this paper, we seek to make such decisions jointly,
accounting for their mutual interaction, and efficiently. To this end, we
formulate a queuing-based model and use it at the network orchestrator to
optimally match the vertical's requirements to the available system resources.
We then propose a fast and efficient solution strategy, called MaxZ, which
allows us to reduce the solution complexity. Our performance evaluation,

We propose a quantum analogue of this technique designed to reconstruct
$d$-dimensional pure states. A set of $n$ rank-$r$ projectors ""scans""
overlapping parts of an input state and the moduli of the $d$ Fourier
amplitudes of each part are measured. These $nd$ outcomes are fed into an
iterative phase retrieval algorithm that estimates the state. Using $d$ up to
100 and $r$ around $d/2$, we performed numerical simulations for single systems
in an economic ($n=4$) and a costly ($n=d$) scenario, as well as for multiqubit
systems ($n=6\log d$). This numeric study included realistic amounts of
depolarization and poissonian noise, and all scenarios yielded, in general,
reconstructions with infidelities below $10^{-2}$. The method is shown,
therefore, to be resilient to noise and, for any $d$, requires a simple and
fast postprocessing algorithm. We show that the algorithm is equivalent to an
alternating gradient search, which ensures that it does not suffer from
local-minima stagnation. Unlike traditional approaches to state reconstruction,
the ptychographic scheme uses a single measurement basis; the diversity and
redundancy in the measured data---key for its success---are provided by the
overlapping projections. We illustrate the simplicity of this scheme with the
paradigmatic multiport interferometer.

vector $h$ of its weight-one subspace. First, we classify all such conformal
structures of the Heisenberg vertex algebra $V_{\hat{\eta}}(1,0)$ by describing
the automorphism group of the Heisenberg vertex algebra $V_{\hat{\eta}}(1,0)$
and then we describe moduli spaces of their conformal structures that have the
standard fixed conformal gradation. Moreover, we study the moduli spaces of
semi-conformal vertex operator subalgebras of each of such conformal structures
of the Heisenberg vertex algebra $V_{\hat{\eta}}(1,0)$. In such cases, we
describe their semi-conformal vectors as pairs consisting of regular subspaces
and the projections of $h$ in these regular subspaces. Then by automorphism
groups $G$ of Heisenberg vertex operator algebras, we get all $G$-orbits of
varieties consisting of semi-conformal vectors of these vertex operator
algebras. Finally, using properties of these varieties, we give two
characterizations of Heisenberg vertex operator algebras.

Excited state band mapping is used to characterize the normally unoccupied
electronic structure above the Fermi level in both structural phases of indium
nanowires on Si(111): the metallic (4x1) and the gapped (8x2) phases. The
extracted band positions are compared with the band structure calculated using
density functional theory (DFT) within both the LDA and GW approximations.
While good overall agreement is found between the GW calculated band structure
and experiment, deviations in specific momentum regions may indicate the
importance of excitonic effects not accounted for at this level of
approximation. To probe the dynamics of these excited states, their
momentum-resolved transient population dynamics are extracted. The transient
intensities are then simulated by a spectral function determined by a state
population employing a transient elevated electronic temperature as determined
experimentally. This allows the momentum-resolved population dynamics to be
quantitatively reproduced, revealing important insights into the transfer of
energy from the electronic system to the lattice. In particular, a comparison
between the magnitude and relaxation time of the transient electronic
temperature observed by trARPES with those of the lattice as probed in previous
ultrafast electron diffraction studies imply a highly non-thermal phonon
distribution at the surface following photo-excitation. This suggests the
energy from the excited electronic system is initially transferred to high
energy optical phonon modes followed by cooling and thermalization of the
photo-excited system by much slower phonon-phonon coupling.

materials that can account for fracture growth under cyclic loads below the
Griffith threshold. We incorporate the gradual degradation due to a cyclic load
through a flow equation that decreases spatially varying parameters controlling
the fracture toughness in the vicinity of the crack tip, with the phase and
displacement fields relaxed to an energy minimum at each time step. Though our
approach is phenomenological, it naturally reproduces the Paris law with high
exponents that are characteristic of brittle fatigue crack growth. We show that
the exponent decreases when the phase field dynamics is of the Ginzburg-Landau
type with a relaxation time comparable to the cyclic loading period, or when
degradation occurs on a scale larger than the process zone. In addition to
reproducing the Paris law, our approach can be used to model the growth of
multiple cracks in arbitrarily complex geometries under varied loading
conditions as illustrated by a few numerical examples in two and three
dimensions.

strong capability in static long haul distributed temperature/strain sensing.
However, in applications such as structural health monitoring and leakage
detection, real-time measurement is quite necessary. The measurement time of
temperature/strain in a BOTDA system includes data acquisition time and
post-processing time. In this work, we propose to use hardware accelerated
support vector regression (SVR) for the post-processing of the collected BOTDA
data. Ideal Lorentzian curves under different temperatures with different
linewidths are used to train the SVR model to determine the linear SVR decision
function. The performance of SVR is evaluated under different signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs) experimentally. After the model coefficients are determined,
algorithm-specific hardware accelerators based on field programmable gate
arrays (FPGAs) are used to realize SVR decision function. During the
implementation, hardware optimization techniques based on loop dependence
analysis and batch processing are proposed to reduce the execution latency. Our
FPGA implementations can achieve up to 42x speedup compared with software
implementation on an i7-5960x computer. The post-processing time for 96,100
BGSs along 38.44-km FUT is only 0.46 seconds with FPGA board ZCU104, making the
post-processing time no longer a limiting factor for dynamic sensing. Moreover,
the energy efficiency of our FPGA implementation can reach up to 226.1x higher
than software implementation based on CPU.

tidal equations. Meanwhile, the system of Laplace tidal equations (including
continuity equation) has been successfully explored with respect to the
existence of analytical way for presentation of the solution. As the main
result, the new ansatz is suggested here for solving LTE: solving momentum
equation is reduced to solving system of 3 nonlinear ordinary differential
equations of 1-st order in regard to 3 components of the flow velocity
(depending on time t), along with the continuity equation which determines the
spatial part of solution. Nevertheless, the proper elegant partial solution has
been obtained due to invariant dependence between temporary components of the

a convenient solution to meet the goals of sustainable development. New tools
are required to support practitioners, decision-makers and policy-makers
towards more CE practices, as well as to monitor the effects of CE adoption.
Worldwide, academics, industrialists and politicians all agree on the need to
use CE-related measuring instruments to manage this transition at different
systemic levels. In this context, a wide range of circularity indicators
(C-indicators) has been developed in recent years. Yet, as there is not one
single definition of the CE concept, it is of the utmost importance to know
what the available indicators measure in order to use them properly. Indeed,
through a systematic literature review-considering both academic and grey
literature-55 sets of C-indicators, developed by scholars, consulting companies
and governmental agencies, have been identified, encompassing different
purposes, scopes, and potential usages. Inspired by existing taxonomies of
eco-design tools and sustainability indicators, and in line with the CE
characteristics, a classification of indicators aiming to assess, improve,
monitor and communicate on the CE performance is proposed and discussed. In the
developed taxonomy including 10 categories, C-indicators are differentiated
regarding criteria such as the levels of CE implementation (e.g. micro, meso,
macro), the CE loops (maintain, reuse, remanufacture, recycle), the performance
(intrinsic, impacts), the perspective of circularity (actual, potential) they
are taking into account, or their degree of transversality (generic,
sector-specific). In addition, the database inventorying the 55 sets of
C-indicators is linked to an Excel-based query tool to facilitate the selection
of appropriate indicators according to the specific user's needs and
requirements. This study enriches the literature by giving a first need-driven
taxonomy of C-indicators, which is experienced on several use cases. It
provides a synthesis and clarification to the emerging and must-needed research
theme of C-indicators, and sheds some light on remaining key challenges like
their effective uptake by industry. Eventually, limitations, improvement areas,
as well as implications of the proposed taxonomy are intently addressed to
guide future research on C-indicators and CE implementation.

the Localization and Mapping Platform (LAMP) as a modular, contextual and
radiation detector sensor suite, which performs gamma-ray mapping in three
dimensions (3-D) and in real time, onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or
in a man-portable configuration. The deployment of an unmanned aerial system
(UAS) for gamma-ray mapping can be advantageous, as the UAS provides a means of
measuring large areas efficiently and improving accessibility to some
environments, such as multi-story structures. In addition, it is possible to
increase measurement robustness through autonomous navigation, and to reduce
radiation exposure to users as a result of the remote measurement. LAMP enables
meter-resolution gamma-ray mapping through Scene Data Fusion (SDF) [1], a
capability that fuses radiation and scene data via voxelized 3-D Maximum
Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) to produce 3-D maps of radioactive
source distributions in real-time. Results are computed onboard LAMP while it
is flying on the UAV and streamed from the system to the user, who can view the
3-D map on a tablet in real-time. We present results that demonstrate the SDF
concept, including a set of UAS flights where a 133Ba source is localized at a
test site in Berkeley, CA and a handheld measurement in Fukushima Prefecture,
Japan where the distribution of radiocesium(137,134Cs) released from the

reconstruction parameters used for each measurement were identical, indicating
that the same algorithm can be used for both point or distributed sources.

cardiovascular neural pathways including a wide range of afferent sensory
neurons, central processing by autonomic premotor neurons, efferent outputs via
preganglionic and postganglionic autonomic neurons and dynamics of
neurotransmitters at cardiovascular effectors organs. We performed over 500
cardiovascular experiments using clinical autonomic tests on 72 subjects
ranging from 11 to 82 years old and collected typical cardiovascular signals
such as electrocardiogram, arterial pulse, arterial blood pressure, respiration
pattern, galvanic skin response and skin temperature. After statistical
evaluation in the time and frequency domains, the data were especially used to
resolving a constrained optimization task. Results bring evidences supporting
the hypothesis that Mayer waves result from a rhythmic sympathetic discharge of
pacemaker-like sympathetic premotor neurons. Simulation also shows that
vagally-mediated tachycardia, observed during vagal maneuvers on some subjects
could be related to the secretion of vasoactive neurotransmitters by the vagal
nerve. We additionally identified model parameters for estimating the resting
sympathetic and parasympathetic tone which are believed to be linked to some
pathological states. Results show higher vagal tone on young subjects with a
decreasing trend with aging, what agrees with the data from heart rate
variability studies. Tonic sympathetic activity was found to possibly emerge
from pacemaker premotor neurons, but also from activation of chemoreceptors to
a lesser extent. The thesis opens perspectives for future work including
validating the markers of autonomic tone provided by our model against data
from experiments with pharmacological blockers and invasive neural activity
recordings.
