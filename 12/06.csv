state in core-collapse supernovae, with a focus on the proto-neutron-star
contraction and its impact on the shock evolution. To this end, we introduce a
range of equations of state that vary the nucleon effective mass,
incompressibility, symmetry energy, and nuclear saturation point. This allows
us to point to the different effects in changing these properties from the
Lattimer and Swesty to the Shen et al. equations of state, the two most
commonly used equations of state in simulations. In particular, we trace the
contraction behavior to the effective mass, which determines the thermal
nucleonic contributions to the equation of state. Larger effective masses lead
to lower pressures at nuclear densities and a lower thermal index. This results
in a more rapid contraction of the proto-neutron star and consequently higher
neutrino energies, which aids the shock evolution to a faster explosion.

  Network","Accepted by MICCAI 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The task of medical image segmentation commonly involves an image
reconstruction step to convert acquired raw data to images before any analysis.
However, noises, artifacts and loss of information due to the reconstruction
process are almost inevitable, which compromises the final performance of
segmentation. We present a novel learning framework that performs magnetic
resonance brain image segmentation directly from k-space data. The end-to-end
framework consists of a unique task-driven attention module that recurrently
utilizes intermediate segmentation estimation to facilitate image-domain
feature extraction from the raw data, thus closely bridging the reconstruction
and the segmentation tasks. In addition, to address the challenge of manual
labeling, we introduce a novel workflow to generate labeled training data for
segmentation by exploiting imaging modality simulators and digital phantoms.
Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods.

thermal-viscous instability in the accretion disk. The disk instability model
(DIM) assumes that accretion is driven by turbulent transport, customarily
attributed to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). Recent results point
out that MRI turbulence alone fails to reproduce the light curves of DNe. We
aim to study the impact of wind-driven accretion on the light curves of DNe.
Local and global simulations show that magneto-hydrodynamic winds are present
when a magnetic field threads the disk, even for relatively high ratios of
thermal pressure to magnetic pressure ($\beta \approx 10^{5}$). These winds are
very efficient in removing angular momentum but do not heat the disk; they do
not behave as MRI-driven turbulence. We add wind-driven transport in the
angular momentum equation of the DIM, assuming a fixed magnetic configuration:
dipolar or constant with radius. We use prescriptions for the wind torque and
the turbulent torque derived from shearing box simulations. The wind torque
enhances the accretion of matter, resulting in light curves that look like DNe
outbursts when assuming a dipolar field with a moment
$\mu\approx10^{30}\,\mathrm{G\,cm^{3}}$. In the region where the wind
dominates, the disk is cold, optically thin and the accretion speed is sonic.
This acts as if the inner disk was truncated, leading to higher quiescent X-ray
luminosities from the white dwarf boundary layer than expected with the
standard DIM. The disk is stabilized if the wind-dominated region is large
enough, potentially leading to `dark' disks emitting little radiation.
Wind-driven accretion can play a key role in shaping the light curves of DNe
and X-ray binaries. Future studies will need to include the time evolution of
the magnetic field threading the disk to fully assess its impact on the
dynamics of the accretion flow.

locally AdS wormhole solution of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in five
dimensions. The radial coordinate $\rho$ connects both asymptotic regions
located at $\rho\rightarrow\pm\infty$. The metric is characterized by a single
integration constant $\rho_{0}$ and the wormhole throat is located at $\rho=0$.
In the region $0<\rho<\rho _{0}$, both the gravitational pull as well as the
centrifugal contributions to the geodesic motion point in the same direction
and therefore they cannot balance. We explore the consequences of the existence
of this region on the propagation of a scalar probe. The cases with
$\rho_{0}=0$ as well as the limit $\rho_{0}\rightarrow +\infty $ lead to
exactly solvable differential eigenvalue problems, with shape-invariant
potentials of the Rosen-Morse and Scarf family, respectively. Here, we
numerically obtain the normal modes of a scalar field when $\rho_0\neq 0$, with
reflecting boundary conditions at both asymptotic regions. We also explore the
effect of a non-minimal coupling between the scalar curvature and the scalar
field. Remarkably, there is a particular value of the non-minimal coupling

  bases and adaptive sampling",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work presents a model reduction approach for problems with coherent
structures that propagate over time such as convection-dominated flows and
wave-type phenomena. Traditional model reduction methods have difficulties with
these transport-dominated problems because propagating coherent structures
typically introduce high-dimensional features that require high-dimensional
approximation spaces. The approach proposed in this work exploits the locality
in space and time of propagating coherent structures to derive efficient
reduced models. Full-model solutions are approximated locally in time via local
reduced spaces that are adapted with basis updates during time stepping. The
basis updates are derived from querying the full model at a few selected
spatial coordinates. A core contribution of this work is an adaptive sampling
scheme for selecting at which components to query the full model to compute
basis updates. The presented analysis shows that, in probability, the more
local the coherent structure is in space, the fewer full-model samples are
required to adapt the reduced basis with the proposed adaptive sampling scheme.
Numerical results on benchmark examples with interacting wave-type structures
and time-varying transport speeds and on a model combustor of a single-element
rocket engine demonstrate the wide applicability of the proposed approach and
runtime speedups of up to one order of magnitude compared to full models and
traditional reduced models.

performing the conceptual interoperability analysis that starts with
identifying the conceptual interoperability constraints of each software unit,
then it compares the systems' constraints to detect their conceptual mismatch.
We call the conceptual interoperability constraints (the COINs) that can be of
different types including structure, dynamic, and quality. Missing such
constraints may lead to unexpected mismatches, expensive resolution, and
running-late projects. However, it is a challenging task for software
architects and analysts to manually analyze the unstructured text in API
documents to identify the COINs. Not only it is a tedious and time-consuming
task, but also it needs knowledge about the constraint types. In this article,
we present and evaluate our idea of utilizing machine learning techniques in
automating the COIN identification, which is the first step of conceptual
interoperability analysis, from human text in API documents. Our empirical
research started with a multiple-case study to build the ground truth dataset,
on which we contributed our machine learning COIN-Classification Model. We show
the model's robustness through experiments using different machine learning
text-classification algorithms. The experiments' results revealed that our
model can achieve up to 87% accuracy in automatically identifying the COINs in
text. Thus, we implemented a tool that embeds our model to demonstrate its
practical value in industrial context. Then, we evaluated the practitioners'
acceptance for the tool and found that they significantly agreed on its
usefulness and ease of use.

In particular, the Ehrhart polynomial of $\mathcal{C}_P$ is given by the order
polynomial of $P$. In the present paper, associated to $P$, we introduce a
lattice polytope $\mathcal{E}_{P}$, which is called the enriched chain polytope
of $P$, and investigate geometric and combinatorial properties of this

that $\mathcal{E}_P$ is a reflexive polytope with a flag regular unimodular
triangulation. Moreover, the $h^*$-polynomial of $\mathcal{E}_P$ is equal to
the $h$-polynomial of a flag triangulation of a sphere. On the other hand, by
showing that the Ehrhart polynomial of $\mathcal{E}_P$ coincides with the left
enriched order polynomial of $P$, it follows from works of Stembridge and
Petersen that the $h^*$-polynomial of $\mathcal{E}_P$ is $\gamma$-positive.

the $f$-polynomial of a flag simplicial complex.

contamination, given by a visibility mask, that affects a deep galaxy survey.
Angular cross correlations of density fields in different redshift bins are
expected to vanish (apart from a contribution due to lensing), but are
sensitive to the presence of a foreground that modulates the flux limit across
the sky. After formalizing the expected effect of a foreground mask on the
measured galaxy density, under a linear, luminosity-dependent bias model for
galaxies, we construct two estimators that single out the mask contribution if
a sufficient number of independent redshift bins is available. These estimators
are combined to give a reconstruction of the mask. We use Milky-Way reddening
as a prototype for the mask. Using a set of 20 large mock catalogs covering
$1/4$-th of the sky and number-matched to $H\alpha$ emitters to mimic an
Euclid-like sample, we demonstrate that our method can reconstruct the mask and
its angular clustering at scales $\ell<100$, beyond which the cosmological
signal becomes dominant. The uncertainty of this reconstruction is quantified
to be $1/3$-rd of the sample variance of the signal. Such a reconstruction
requires knowledge of the average and square average of the mask, but we show
that it is possible to recover this information either from external models or
internally from the data. It also relies on knowledge of how the impact of the
foreground changes with redshift (due to the extinction curve in our case), but
this can be tightly constrained by cross correlations of different redshift
bins. The strong points of this blind reconstruction technique lies in the
ability to find ""unknown unknowns"" that affect a survey, and in the facility to
quantify, using sets of mock catalogs, how its uncertainty propagates to
clustering measurements. [Abridged]

the knowledge of the biodemographic functions characterizing the species,
namely development, mortality and fecundity. In general, development and
fecundity can satisfactorily be estimated starting from literature data.
Unfortunately, this is often not the case of the mortality function, because of
the lack of experimental data. To overcome this problem we estimate the
mortality rate function from field data on the abundance of the species. The
mortality is expressed as a linear combination of cubic splines and the
estimation method allows to determine its coefficients taking into account the
observations measurement error. Moreover, the variability in the estimate is
quantified by means of the confidence bands for both mortality and dynamics.
The presented method allows to obtain a more flexible shape for the mortality
rate functions compared with previous methods applied to the same pest. The
method is applied to the case of Lobesia botrana, the main pest in the European
vineyards, with abundance data collected in a location in the North of Italy
for five consecutive years. Data collected over three years are used to
estimate the mortality and to analyze the variability in the estimate and its
effects on the population dynamics. Other two datasets are used to validate the
model simulating the dynamics using the estimated mortality.

collect samples, so that a K-bandlimited signal can be reconstructed in high
fidelity. Assuming an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise
model, minimizing the expected mean square error (MMSE) leads to the known
A-optimality criterion for graph sampling, which is expensive to compute and
difficult to optimize. In this paper, we propose an augmented objective based
on Neumann series that well approximates the original criterion and is amenable
to greedy optimization. Specifically, we show that a shifted A-optimal
criterion can be equivalently written as a function of an ideal low-pass (LP)
graph filter, which in turn can be approximated efficiently via fast graph
Fourier transform (FGFT). Minimizing the new objective, we select nodes
greedily without large matrix inversions using a matrix inverse lemma. Further,
for the dynamic network case where node availability varies across time, we
propose an extended sampling strategy that replaces offline samples one-by-one
in the selected set. For signal reconstruction, we propose an accompanied
biased signal recovery strategy that reuses the approximated filter from
sampling. Experiments show that our reconstruction is more robust to large
noise than the least square (LS) solution, and our sampling strategy far
outperforms several existing schemes.

phenomenon called geodesic incompleteness, the physical gravitational
$\theta_G$-term that would characterize the 1-parameter family of inequivalent
vacua of quantum gravidynamics, and the hypothesis of multiversality, more
specifically, a zero-energy multiverse.
  The known cosmological phenomenology leads under plausible assumptions to
theorems which establish that the universe is past incomplete. Here, starting
from Wilczek's definition of multiverse (a larger physical structure of which
the universe forms part) and that spacetime is much larger than the observable
universe, in a new sense suggested by these theorems, we place the observable
universe, labelled by $U_{\theta_G^{(1)}}$, within a multiverse ensemble,
$\{U_{\theta_G}\}$. Its topological $\theta_G^{(1)}$-term would characterize
the observable universe from the Planck epoch until the present time, and it
could have physical effects in, for example, black-hole physics.
  Our proposal is therefore a possible framework for a multiverse quantum
cosmology, in which the temporal parameters (see figures in the main text)
start from a ""timeless multiverse big bang"" (TLMBB), where all members of the
multiverse ensemble, $\{U_{\theta_G}\}$, disappear, together with their
corresponding classical spacetimes. Since quantum cosmology can be viewed as
one attempt among many to face with the question of finding a gravitational
quantum theory, if the TLMBB were the appropriate ground to define the physical
or mathematical underlying structure of quantum cosmology, then multiversality
could come to have a predictive power within our observable universe.

that these models do not provide information on population abundance, they
share some advantages with respect to the more sophisticated and complex
demographic models. The main advantage is that they do not require data
collection to define the initial conditions of model simulation, reducing the
effort for field sampling and the high uncertainty affecting sample estimates.
Phenological models are often built considering the developmental rate function
only. To the aim of adding more realism to phenological models, in this paper
we explore the consequences of improving these models taking into consideration
three additional elements: the age distribution of individuals which exit from
the overwintering phase, the age- and temperature-dependent profile of the
fecundity rate function and the consideration of a temperature-dependent
mortality rate function. Numerical simulations are performed to investigate the
effect of these elements with respect to phenological models considering
development rate functions only. To further test the implications of different
models formulation, we compare results obtained from different phenological
models to the case study of the codling moth (Cydia pomonella) a primary pest

representation for line segment maps, and thus poses the problem of line
segment detection (LSD) as the region coloring problem. The latter is then
addressed by learning deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) for
accuracy, robustness and efficiency. For a 2D line segment map, our dual
representation consists of three components: (i) A region-partition map in
which every pixel is assigned to one and only one line segment; (ii) An
attraction field map in which every pixel in a partition region is encoded by
its 2D projection vector w.r.t. the associated line segment; and (iii) A
squeeze module which squashes the attraction field to a line segment map that
almost perfectly recovers the input one. By leveraging the duality, we learn
ConvNets to compute the attraction field maps for raw in-put images, followed
by the squeeze module for LSD, in an end-to-end manner. Our method rigorously
addresses several challenges in LSD such as local ambiguity and class
imbalance. Our method also harnesses the best practices developed in ConvNets
based semantic segmentation methods such as the encoder-decoder architecture
and the a-trous convolution. In experiments, our method is tested on the

of an electronic device, called mass inverter, which consists of the junction
of a narrow-gap semiconductor and semimetal. Such a device can be used in
electron optics applications, since it operates as a Veselago lens and presents
Klein tunneling (KT) of 3D massive Kane fermions under normal incidence. We
found that KT and Veselago lensing can also be observed for general MCT
heterojunctions with a specific value of doping level. We show that
non-resontant perfect transmission of massive Kane fermions persists in a
potential barrier for heterojunctions formed by a semimetal between two
standard semiconductors. This effect is quite robust when the ideal conditions
of a possible experimental test are deviated. Our findings may have important
implications in the development of nano-electronic devices using 3D massive
Kane fermions, where transmission features of massless particles are recovered.

strategies to minimize traffic congestion. As the number of traffic sensors is
naturally constrained by budgetary requirements, real-time estimation of
traffic flow in road segments that are not equipped with sensors is of
significant importance---thereby providing situational awareness and guiding
real-time feedback control strategies. To that end, firstly we build a
generalized traffic flow model for stretched highways with arbitrary number of
ramp flows based on the Lighthill Whitham Richards (LWR) flow model. Secondly,
we characterize the function set corresponding to the nonlinearities present in
the LWR model, and use this characterization to design real-time and robust
state estimators (SE) for stretched highway segments. Specifically, we show
that the nonlinearities from the derived models are locally Lipschitz
continuous by providing the analytical Lipschitz constants. Thirdly, the
analytical derivation is then incorporated through a robust SE method given a
limited number of traffic sensors, under the impact of process and measurement
disturbances and unknown inputs. The estimator is based on deriving a convex
semidefinite optimization problem. Finally, numerical tests are given
showcasing the applicability, scalability, and robustness of the proposed

PIMC for 1D stoquastic Hamiltonians, including disordered transverse Ising
models (TIM) with long-range algebraically decaying interactions as well as
disordered XY spin chains with nearest-neighbor interactions. By bounding the
convergence time to the equilibrium distribution we rigorously justify the use
of PIMC to approximate partition functions and expectations of observables for
these models at inverse temperatures that scale at most logarithmically with
the number of qubits. The mixing time analysis is based on the canonical paths
method applied to the single-site Metropolis Markov chain for the Gibbs
distribution of 2D classical spin models with couplings related to the
interactions in the quantum Hamiltonian. Since the system has strongly
nonisotropic couplings that grow with system size, it does not fall into the
known cases where 2D classical spin models are known to mix rapidly.

small planets can be used as an evidence for the presence of water in their
lower atmosphere but, to date, such feature has not been securely detected in
rocky exoplanets. Planetary exospheres can be observed using transit
spectroscopy of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line, which is limited mainly by
interstellar medium absorption in the core of the line, and airglow
contamination from the geocorona when using low-orbit space telescopes. Our
objective is to assess the detectability of the neutral hydrogen exosphere of
an Earth-like planet transiting a nearby M dwarf using Lyman-$\alpha$
spectroscopy and provide the necessary strategies to inform future
observations. The spatial distribution in the upper atmosphere is provided by
an empirical model of the geocorona, and we assume a velocity distribution
based on radiative pressure as the main driver in shaping the exosphere. We
compute the excess absorption in the stellar Lyman-$\alpha$ line while in
transit, and use realistic estimates of the uncertainties involved in
observations to determine the observability of the signal. We found that the
signal in Lyman-$\alpha$ of the exosphere of an Earth-like exoplanet transiting
M dwarfs with radii between 0.1 and 0.6 R$_\odot$ produces an excess absorption
between 50 and 600 ppm. The Lyman-$\alpha$ flux of stars decays exponentially
with distance because of interstellar medium absorption, which is the main
observability limitation. Other limits are related to the stellar radial
velocity and instrumental setup. The excess absorption in Lyman-$\alpha$ is
observable using LUVOIR/LUMOS in M dwarfs up to a distance of $\sim$15 pc. The
analysis of noise-injected data suggests that it would be possible to detect
the exosphere of an Earth-like planet transiting TRAPPIST-1 within 20 transits.

Thus, they are thought to be among the progenitors of large-scale radio

young or because they are surrounded by a dense medium impacting their
expansion is ongoing. Until now, attempts to discriminate between the
environmental and genuine youthfulness scenarios have been inconclusive. We
present a study of three CSOs selected on the basis of their puzzling X-ray
absorbing properties in prior Beppo-SAX and/or Chandra X-ray Observatory data.
Our new XMM-Newton observations unambiguously confirm the nature of their X-ray
absorbers. Furthermore, for the first time, our X-ray data reveal the existence
of a population of CSOs with intrinsic hydrogen column density $N_H > 10^{23}$
cm$^{-2}$ that is different from the population of X-ray unabsorbed CSOs. The
two groups appear to be separated in the linear size vs. radio power plane.
This finding suggests that a dense medium in X-ray obscured CSOs may be able to
confine the radio jets. Alternatively, X-ray obscured CSOs could be seen as
radio brighter than their unobscured counterparts either because they reside in
a dense environment or because they have larger jet powers. Our results help
constrain the origin of the X-ray emission and the location and size of the
X-ray obscurer in CSOs, and indicate that the environment may play a key role
during the initial expansion of a radio source.

Brenier (J. Am. Math. Soc, 1989), from the perspective of turbulence modelling.
In essence, Brenier's least-action principle extends to a probabilistic setting
Arnold's geometric interpretation of ideal fluid mechanics, whereby strong
solutions to the Euler equations are deduced from minimising an action over
Lagrangian maps. While Arnold's framework relies on the deterministic concept
of Lagrangian flow, Brenier's least-action principle describes solutions to the
Euler equations in terms of non-deterministic ""generalised flows"", namely
probability measures over sets of Lagrangian trajectories. Generalised flows
seem naturally fit to describe turbulent Lagrangian trajectories in terms of
stochastic processes, an approach that originates from Richardson's seminal
work on turbulent dispersion. In particular, they seem suited to address cases
when the concept of Lagrangian flow breaks down, due to Lagrangian trajectories
becoming spontaneously stochastic. The purpose of the present paper is
therefore to give a physical perspective on Brenier's principle, and provide a
qualitative description of the hydrodynamical features of generalised flows.
Using Monte-Carlo techniques, we analyse the statistical features of three
classes of two-dimensional generalised flows, ranging from solid rotation and
cellular flows to to freely decaying two-dimensional turbulence. Our results
suggest that generalised variational formulations, if carefully used, may
provide new tools to coarse-grain multi-scale hydrodynamics.

particular, by casting the problem as a binary classification amongst different

formulation allows scalable evaluations of comparative summarisation as a
classification task, both automatically and via crowd-sourcing. To this end, we
evaluate comparative summarisation methods on a newly curated collection of
controversial news topics over 13 months. We observe that gradient-based
optimisation outperforms discrete and baseline approaches in 14 out of 24
different automatic evaluation settings. In crowd-sourced evaluations,
summaries from gradient optimisation elicit 7% more accurate classification
from human workers than discrete optimisation. Our result contrasts with recent

optimisation. We posit that our formulation of comparative summarisation will
prove useful in a diverse range of use cases such as comparing content sources,

dwarf. A difference between AR Sco and these other systems is that the white
dwarf in AR Sco is rapidly spinning relative to the orbital period. ""Slingshot""
prominences stable at 3 to 5 stellar radii require surface magnetic fields
between 100 and 500 G. This is comparable to the estimated WD magnetic field
strength near the surface of the secondary. Our time-resolved spectra also show
emission fluxes, line equivalent widths, and continuum color varying over the
orbit and the beat/spin periods of the system. During much of the orbit, the
optical spectral variations are consistent with synchrotron emission with the
highest energy electrons cooling between pulses. On the time-scale of the
beat/spin period we detect red and blue-shifted H$\alpha$ emission flashes that
reach velocities of 700 km/s. Red-shifted Balmer emission flashes are
correlated with the bright phases of the continuum beat pulses while
blue-shifted flashes appear to prefer the time of minimum in the beat light
curve. We propose that much of the energy generated in AR Sco comes from fast
magnetic reconnection events occurring near the inward face of the secondary

Coadjoint orbits are symplectic manifolds that are the classical analogues of a

position of the 7.7 ${\mu}$m feature (${\lambda}$7.7). The 7.7 ${\mu}$m band is
known to vary significantly from object-to-object in astronomical observations,
but the origin of these variations remains highly speculative. Our results
indicate that PAH size can accommodate the largest shift in ${\lambda}$7.7
(~0.4 ${\mu}$m), where relatively small PAHs are consistent with class A
spectra (fewer than 60 carbon atoms) while large PAHs are consistent with
red/very red class B spectra. Aliphatic PAHs, of which our sample only contains
a few, can produce redshifts typically around 0.15 ${\mu}$m; changes in
ionization fraction, depending on the species, produce shifts up to 0.1
${\mu}$m; and nitrogen substitution has no effect on ${\lambda}$7.7. Within the
limits of our study, the class B-to-A transition is best explained with a
changing PAH size distribution, with a relatively minor role assigned to
aliphatic content and varying charge states. The resulting astronomical picture
is that the photochemical evolution of PAHs moving from shielded class C/B
environments into exposed ISM-like class A environments may be intrinsically
different from the reverse class A-to-B transition of interstellar PAHs being

is probed by a number of observations. Radio observations reveal the
synchrotron radiation of cosmic ray electrons (CRe) spiraling around cluster
magnetic fields. $\gamma$-ray observations reveal hadronic reactions of cosmic
ray protons (CRp) with ambient gas nuclei which produce pions. To date, no such
cluster-wide $\gamma$-ray signal has been measured, putting an upper limit on
the density of CRp present in clusters. But the presence of CRe implies some
source of CRp, and consequently there must be some CRp loss mechanism. In this
paper we quantify the observational constraints on this loss mechanism assuming
that losses are dominated by CR transport, ultimately deriving a minimum
diffusion coefficient of $\sim10^{31}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ in the Coma cluster.
This lower limit on transport may help illuminate some unknown properties of
the cluster field topology. Conversely, measurements of cluster field tangling
scales can constrain other model parameters, such as the relative acceleration
efficiency of protons to electrons. To be consistent with the Coma
observations, protons cannot be accelerated more than 15 times more efficiently
than electrons of the same energy.

cooling models to photometric rotation periods and/or spectral vsini

after formation. They then spin down as they age much as standard solar-type
main-sequence stars do. We discuss the physical implications of this result,
which suggests that the spin-down of post-mass transfer stars can be described
by standard magnetic-braking prescriptions. This opens up the possibility of
using gyrochronology as a method to determine the time since formation of blue
straggler stars and other post-mass-transfer binaries.

challenges to classify astronomical objects. Pioneering efforts on this front
include citizen science campaigns adopted by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). SDSS datasets have been recently used to train neural network models to
classify galaxies in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) that overlap the footprint of
both surveys. Herein, we demonstrate that knowledge from deep learning
algorithms, pre-trained with real-object images, can be transferred to classify
galaxies that overlap both SDSS and DES surveys, achieving state-of-the-art
accuracy $\gtrsim99.6\%$. We demonstrate that this process can be completed
within just eight minutes using distributed training. While this represents a
significant step towards the classification of DES galaxies that overlap
previous surveys, we need to initiate the characterization of unlabelled DES
galaxies in new regions of parameter space. To accelerate this program, we use
our neural network classifier to label over ten thousand unlabelled DES
galaxies, which do not overlap previous surveys. Furthermore, we use our neural
network model as a feature extractor for unsupervised clustering and find that
unlabeled DES images can be grouped together in two distinct galaxy classes
based on their morphology, which provides a heuristic check that the learning
is successfully transferred to the classification of unlabelled DES images. We
conclude by showing that these newly labeled datasets can be combined with
unsupervised recursive training to create large-scale DES galaxy catalogs in
preparation for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope era.

different velocity channels as well. Recently, Miville-Desch\^enes et al.
(2016) have measured the intensity fluctuation power spectrum of the continuum
dust emission, and found a power law behaviour with a power law index of $-2.9
\pm 0.1$ for a region of our Galaxy. Here, we study the same region using
high-velocity resolution 21-cm emission from the diffuse neutral medium, and
estimate the power spectrum at different spectral channels. The measured 21-cm
power spectrum also follows a power law, however, we see a significant
variation in the power law index with velocity. The value of the power-law
index estimated from the integrated map for different components are quite
different which is indicative of the different nature of turbulence depending
on temperature, density and ionization fraction. We also measure the power
spectra after smoothing the 21 cm emission to velocity resolution ranging from
$1.03$ to $13.39~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, but the power spectrum remains unchanged
within the error bar. This indicates that the observed fluctuations are
dominantly due to density fluctuations, and we can only constrain the power-law
index of velocity structure function of $0.0 \pm 1.1$ which is consistent with
the predicted Kolmogorov turbulence $(\gamma=2/3)$ and also with a
shock-dominated medium $(\gamma=1.0)$.

rotational velocity contributions, as well as to freely control the one-body

adjusted. The practical convergence to a unique external force field
demonstrates the existence of a functional map from both velocity and density

framework. In equilibrium, the method allows to find the conservative force
field that generates a prescribed target density profile, and hence implements
the Mermin-Evans classical density functional map from density distribution to

instance, the connection between the breakdown of the conventional

previously observed numerically, is traced back to the transfer matrix having a
determinant not equal to unity. The vanishing of this determinant signals
real-space exceptional points, whose order scales with the system size. We also
derive previously proposed topological invariants such as the biorthogonal

Solar System objects on dynamically excited orbits. The overall color
distribution is bimodal and can be decomposed into two distinct classes, termed
`gray' and `red', that each has a normal color distribution. The two color
classes have different inclination distributions: red objects have lower
inclinations than the gray ones. This trend holds for all dynamically excited
TNO populations. Even in the worst-case scenario, biases in the discovery
surveys cannot account for this trend: it is intrinsic to the TNO population.
Considering that TNOs are the precursors of centaurs, and that their
inclinations are roughly preserved as they become centaurs, our finding solves
the conundrum of centaurs being the only outer Solar System population
identified so far to exhibit this property (Tegler et al. 2016). The different
orbital distributions of the gray and red dynamically excited TNOs provide
strong evidence that their colors are due to different formation locations in a

discontinuity across the cut of a Cauchy representation of an otherwise

direct approaches. The real, positive, and continuous weight function, rho(x),
is constructed directly from interpolation of the zeros, x[k], and weights,
w[k], of the polynomials orthogonal for that measure. This novel numerical
approach rests on a simple theorem: namely, rho(x[k]), evaluated at the
quadrature point x[k], is approximated by w[k]/(dx[k]/dk), with k now being
assumed to be a continuous real variable. This derivative rule is shown to be
closely related to a simple type of universal behavior, relating the clock-rule
spacings of the x[k] to the derivatives dx[k]/dk which, once established,
allows an immediate derivation of the derivative rule, via known and well
understood clock-rule results for Nevai-Blumenthal class polynomials. This
framework also leads to a statement of a universality for quadrature weights
and weight functions. This is implicit in statements of clock-rule universality
for the N-B class, but not made explicit. This new universality is illustrated
for several classical orthogonal polynomials, and the non-classical Pollaczek
polynomials. The derivative rule is then applied to the problem of numerical
Stieltjes inversion, for both finite and unbounded intervals giving exponential
convergence. Exponential convergence stands in stark contrast to the power law
convergence of historically well-known histogram techniques A final section

the Milky Way. While the LSST Wide-Fast-Deep survey and accompanying Deep
Drilling and mini-surveys will be ground-breaking for each of these areas,
there remain competing demands on the survey area, depth, and temporal coverage
amid a desire to maximize all three. In this white paper, we seek to address a
principal source of tension between the different LSST science collaborations,
that of the survey area and depth that they each need in the parts of the sky
that they care about. We present simple tools which can be used to explore
trades between the area surveyed by LSST and the number of visits available per
field and then use these tools to propose a change to the baseline survey
strategy. Specifically, we propose to reconfigure the WFD footprint to consist
of low-extinction regions (limited by galactic latitude), with the number of
visits per field in WFD limited by the LSST Science Requirements Document (SRD)
design goal, and suggest assignment of the remaining LSST visits to the full
visible LSST sky. This proposal addresses concerns with the WFD footprint
raised by the DESC (as 25 percent of the current baseline WFD region is not
usable for dark energy science due to MW dust extinction), eases the time
required for the NES and SCP mini-surveys (since in our proposal they would
partially fall into the modified WFD footprint), raises the number of visits
previously assigned to the GP region, and increases the overlap with DESI and
other Northern hemisphere follow-up facilities. This proposal alleviates many
of the current concerns of Science Collaborations that represent the four
scientific pillars of LSST and provides a Big Sky approach to cadence

$10^{14}\ h^{-1}\ \text{M}_\odot$. We explore the hypothesis that mass
accretion in filamentary environments alters the angular momentum of a halo,
thereby driving a correlation between the spin parameter $\lambda$ and the
strength of clustering. However, we do not find evidence that the distribution
of matter on large scales is related to the spin of haloes. We find that a
halo's spin is correlated with its age, concentration, sphericity, and mass
accretion rate. Removing these correlations strongly affects the strength of
secondary spin bias at low halo masses. We also find that high spin haloes are
slightly more likely to be found near another halo of comparable mass. These
haloes that are found near a comparable mass neighbour - a \textit{twin} - are
strongly spatially biased. We demonstrate that this \textit{twin bias}, along

affect the predictive performance of the induced models in intricate ways. Due
to the high number of possibilities for these hyperparameter configurations,

find settings that lead to high predictive accuracy. However, we lack insight
into how to efficiently explore this vast space of configurations: which are
the best optimization techniques, how should we use them, and how significant
is their effect on predictive or runtime performance? This paper provides a
comprehensive approach for investigating the effects of hyperparameter tuning
on three Decision Tree induction algorithms, CART, C4.5 and CTree. These
algorithms were selected because they are based on similar principles, have
presented a high predictive performance in several previous works and induce
interpretable classification models. Additionally, they contain many
interacting hyperparameters to be adjusted. Experiments were carried out with
different tuning strategies to induce models and evaluate the relevance of
hyperparameters using 94 classification datasets from OpenML. Experimental
results indicate that hyperparameter tuning provides statistically significant
improvements for C4.5 and CTree in only one-third of the datasets, and in most
of the datasets for CART. Different tree algorithms may present different
tuning scenarios, but in general, the tuning techniques required relatively few
iterations to find accurate solutions. Furthermore, the best technique for all
the algorithms was the Irace. Finally, we find that tuning a specific small
subset of hyperparameters contributes most of the achievable optimal predictive
performance.

it is not only determined by the final Hamiltonian but also depends on the

the knowledge of true sub-grid stress information during the training phase due
to its focus on estimating an effective filter and its inverse so that
grid-resolved variables may be related to direct numerical simulation data
statistically. The proposed predictive framework is also combined with a
statistical truncation mechanism for ensuring numerical realizability in an
explicit formulation. Through this we seek to unite structural and functional
modeling strategies for modeling non-linear partial differential equations
using reduced degrees of freedom. Both a priori and a posteriori results are
shown for a two-dimensional decaying turbulence case in addition to a detailed
description of validation and testing. A hyperparameter sensitivity study also
shows that the proposed dual network framework simplifies learning complexity
and is viable with exceedingly simple network architectures. Our findings
indicate that the proposed framework approximates a robust and stable sub-grid

programming (LP) relaxation. We introduce a type of consistency that is
particularly suited for 0-1 programming and develop the associated theory. We
define a 0-1 constraint set as LP-consistent when any partial assignment that
is consistent with its linear programming relaxation is consistent with the
original 0-1 constraint set. We prove basic properties of LP-consistency,
including its relationship with Chvatal-Gomory cuts and the integer hull. We
show that a weak form of LP-consistency can reduce or eliminate backtracking in

Specifically, if the EP associated with the ordered system occurs at the fixed

break the integrity of the results. One would never want another analyst to
repeat a calculation with the same dataset, using a seemingly identical
procedure, only to find a different conclusion. However, as we show in this
work, there is a typical source of uncertainty that is essentially never
considered in observational causal studies: the choice of match assignment for
matched groups, that is, which unit is matched to which other unit before a
hypothesis test is conducted. The choice of match assignment is anything but
innocuous, and can have a surprisingly large influence on the causal
conclusions. Given that a vast number of causal inference studies test
hypotheses on treatment effects after treatment cases are matched with similar
control cases, we should find a way to quantify how much this extra source of
uncertainty impacts results. What we would really like to be able to report is
that \emph{no matter} which match assignment is made, as long as the match is
sufficiently good, then the hypothesis test result still holds. In this paper,
we provide methodology based on discrete optimization to create robust tests

molecule is the fundamental basis for understanding a broad range of scientific
problems in heterogeneous catalysis, semiconductor device fabrication, and fuel
cells. Widespread understandings are based on the molecular orbital theory and
focused on the degree of filling of antibonding surface-adsorbate states that
weaken bonding on surfaces. The unoccupied antibonding surface-adsorbate states
are often tacitly assumed to be irrelevant. Here, we show that most antibonding
states become unoccupied because the electrons that would occupy these
antibonding states are transferred to the lower-energy Fermi level. Such
antibonding electron transfer goes beyond molecular orbital theory. It leads to
an energy gain that largely controls the trends of surface adsorption strength
and can serve as a primary descriptor for bonding on surfaces. This finding is
illustrated from the first-principles study of hydrogen adsorption on MoS$_2$
surfaces. A clear linear relationship between the energies of antibonding
electron transfer and hydrogen adsorption is identified. The hydrogen evolution
reaction on MoS$_2$ is found to originate from the in-gap states induced by
sulfur vacancies or edges. The effects of surface inhomogeneity (e.g., defects,
step edges) on surface catalysis can be understood from the corresponding
different energies gained from antibonding electron transfer. The emerging
picture also offers a physically different explanation for the well-known
$d$-band theory for hydrogen adsorption on transition metal surfaces.

manner? The disentangled representation learning approach posits that such an
agent would benefit from separating out (disentangling) the underlying
structure of the world into disjoint parts of its representation. However,
there is no generally agreed-upon definition of disentangling, not least
because it is unclear how to formalise the notion of world structure beyond toy
datasets with a known ground truth generative process. Here we propose that a
principled solution to characterising disentangled representations can be found
by focusing on the transformation properties of the world. In particular, we
suggest that those transformations that change only some properties of the
underlying world state, while leaving all other properties invariant, are what
gives exploitable structure to any kind of data. Similar ideas have already
been successfully applied in physics, where the study of symmetry
transformations has revolutionised the understanding of the world structure. By
connecting symmetry transformations to vector representations using the
formalism of group and representation theory we arrive at the first formal
definition of disentangled representations. Our new definition is in agreement
with many of the current intuitions about disentangling, while also providing
principled resolutions to a number of previous points of contention. While this
work focuses on formally defining disentangling - as opposed to solving the
learning problem - we believe that the shift in perspective to studying data
transformations can stimulate the development of better representation learning
algorithms.

uncertainty in a consistent manner in all but the simplest applications of
machine learning systems. In particular, a desideratum for any real-world

of fluid turbulence. Instead of resolving all scales of motion, which is
currently mathematically and numerically intractable, reduced models that
capture the large-scale behavior are derived. One of the most popular reduced
models is the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The goal is to
solve the RANS equations for the mean velocity and pressure field. However, the
RANS equations contain a term called the Reynolds stress tensor, which is not
known in terms of the mean velocity field. Many RANS turbulence models have
been proposed to model the Reynolds stress tensor in terms of the mean velocity
field, but are usually not suitably general for all flow fields of interest.
Data-driven turbulence models have recently garnered considerable attention and
have been rapidly developed. In a seminal work, Ling et al (2016) developed the
tensor basis neural network (TBNN), which was used to learn a general Galilean
invariant model for the Reynolds stress tensor. The TBNN was applied to a
variety of flow fields with encouraging results. In the present study, the TBNN
is applied to the turbulent channel flow. Its performance is compared with
classical turbulence models as well as a neural network model that does not
preserve Galilean invariance. A sensitivity study on the TBNN reveals that the
network attempts to adjust to the dataset, but is limited by the mathematical
form that guarantees Galilean invariance.

allowing for tilt (rotation about Galactic azimuth 90deg.), and roll (rotation
about Galactic azimuth 0deg.) of the midplane with respect to the current
definition. Derivation of the tilt and roll angles also determines the solar
height above the midplane. Here we use nebulae from the WISE Catalog of
Galactic HII Regions to define the Galactic high-mass star formation (HMSF)
midplane. We analyze various subsamples of the WISE catalog and find that all
have Galactic latitude scale heights near 0.30deg. and z-distribution scale
heights near 30pc. The vertical distribution for small (presumably young) HII
regions is narrower than that of larger (presumably old) HII regions (~25pc
versus ~40pc), implying that the larger regions have migrated further from
their birth sites. For all HII region subsamples and for a variety of fitting
methodologies, we find that the HMSF midplane is not significantly tilted or
rolled with respect to the currently-defined midplane, and therefore the Sun is
near to the HMSF midplane. These results are consistent with other studies of
HMSF, but are inconsistent with many stellar studies, perhaps due to
asymmetries in the stellar distribution near the Sun. Our results are sensitive
to latitude restrictions, and also to the completeness of the sample,
indicating that similar analyses cannot be done accurately with less complete
samples. The midplane framework we develop can be used for any future sample of
Galactic objects to redefine the midplane.

the nature of this attack and how it extends to other constructions such as QKE
obtained from uncloneable encryption. We then adopt the framework for quantum
authenticated key exchange, developed by Mosca et al., and extend it to
introduce the notion of coercer-deniable QKE, formalized in terms of the
indistinguishability of real and fake coercer views. Next, we apply results
from a recent work by Arrazola and Scarani on covert quantum communication to
establish a connection between covert QKE and deniability. We propose DC-QKE, a
simple deniable covert QKE protocol, and prove its deniability via a reduction
to the security of covert QKE. Finally, we consider how entanglement
distillation can be used to enable information-theoretically deniable protocols

volumetric cine visualisation of the fetal heart and great vessels in the
presence of maternal and fetal motion.
  Methods: Four-dimensional depiction was achieved using a highly-accelerated
multi-planar real-time balanced steady state free precession acquisition
combined with retrospective image-domain techniques for motion correction,
cardiac synchronisation and outlier rejection. The framework was evaluated and
optimised using a numerical phantom, and evaluated in a study of 20 mid- to
late-gestational age human fetal subjects. Reconstructed cine volumes were
evaluated by experienced cardiologists and compared with matched ultrasound. A
preliminary assessment of flow-sensitive reconstruction using the velocity
information encoded in the phase of dynamic images is included.
  Results: Reconstructed cine volumes could be visualised in any 2D plane
without the need for highly-specific scan plane prescription prior to
acquisition or for maternal breath hold to minimise motion. Reconstruction was
fully automated aside from user-specified masks of the fetal heart and chest.
The framework proved robust when applied to fetal data and simulations
confirmed that spatial and temporal features could be reliably recovered.
Expert evaluation suggested the reconstructed volumes can be used for
comprehensive assessment of the fetal heart, either as an adjunct to ultrasound
or in combination with other MRI techniques.
  Conclusion: The proposed methods show promise as a framework for
motion-compensated 4D assessment of the fetal heart and great vessels.

inverting a single conformal block in the crossed channel returns the
coefficient function of the crossing-symmetric sum of Witten exchange diagrams
in AdS, including the direct-channel exchange. The inversion kernel exhibits
poles at the double-trace scaling dimensions, whose contributions must cancel
out in a generic solution to crossing. In this way the inversion formula leads
to a derivation of the Polyakov bootstrap for $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$. The residues
of the inversion kernel at the double-trace dimensions give rise to analytic
bootstrap functionals discussed in recent literature, thus providing an
alternative explanation for their existence. We also use the formula to give a
general proof that the coefficient function of the principal series is
meromorphic in the entire complex plane with poles only at the expected

from network synchronization, distributed information fusion, decentralized

information. In this paper, we propose a novel average consensus approach for
directed graphs which can protect the privacy of participating nodes' initial
states without the assistance of any trusted third party or data aggregator. By
leveraging the inherent robustness of consensus dynamics to embed privacy in
random coupling weights between interacting nodes, our proposed approach can
guarantee consensus to the exact value without any error. This is in distinct
difference from differential-privacy based average consensus approaches which
enable privacy through sacrificing accuracy in obtained consensus value. The
proposed approach is able to preserve privacy even when multiple
honest-but-curious nodes collude with each other. Furthermore, by encrypting
exchanged information, the proposed approach can also provide privacy
protection against inference by external eavesdroppers wiretapping
communication links. Numerical simulations and hardware experiments on

which becomes infeasible very quickly for large data sets. In recent years,
scalable algorithms have been designed which study the primal or dual
formulations of the problem. This often suggests a way to decompose the problem
and facilitate development of distributed algorithms. In this paper, we present
a distributed algorithm for learning linear Support Vector Machines in the
primal form for binary classification called Gossip-bAseD sub-GradiEnT (GADGET)
SVM. The algorithm is designed such that it can be executed locally on nodes of
a distributed system. Each node processes its local homogeneously partitioned
data and learns a primal SVM model. It then gossips with random neighbors about
the classifier learnt and uses this information to update the model. Extensive
theoretical and empirical results suggest that this anytime algorithm has
performance comparable to its centralized and online counterparts.

piezoelectric substrate, and steady perpendicular magnetic oscillation is
achieved in the attached Ni disk when the frequency of the voltage matches the
ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the Ni disk. The FMR can be tuned by simply
changing the voltage bias, therefore, the oscillation frequency has a wide
range. A systematic simulation study is conducted to investigate the impact of
the voltage amplitude, frequency, waveform, as well as the thickness of the
magnet on the magnetic oscillation. This opens new possibilities of designing
energy efficient nanomagnetic oscillators using multiferroics that have large

in general) has focused on understanding the former with less attention paid to
the latter. However, supercooled water exhibits fascinating and complex
dynamical behavior, most notably dynamical heterogeneity (DH), a phenomenon
where spatially separated domains of relatively mobile and immobile particles
coexist. Strikingly, the microscopic connection between the DH of water and the
nucleation of ice has yet to be unraveled directly at the molecular level. Here
we tackle this issue via computer simulations which reveal that: (i) ice
nucleation occurs in low-mobility regions of the liquid; (ii) there is a
dynamical incubation period in which the mobility of the molecules drops prior
to any ice-like ordering; and (iii) ice-like clusters cause arrested dynamics
in surrounding water molecules. With this we establish a clear connection
between dynamics and nucleation. We anticipate that our findings will pave the
way for the examination of the role of dynamical heterogeneities in
heterogeneous and solution-based nucleation.

incoherency due to its large magnetostriction coefficient. It is also suggested
that the CoFeB clocking system is slower and has lower bit-density than in Ni

demonstrate that the precessional perpendicular switching and the Bennett

physical space of gauge-invariant quantities transporting the electromagnetic
radiation in perturbations of a charged black hole.
  The proof is based on the use of derived quantities, introduced in previous
works on linear stability of Schwarzschild by Dafermos-Holzegel-Rodnianski. The
derived quantity verifies a Fackerell-Ipser-type equation, with right hand side
vanishing at the $\ell=1$ spherical harmonics. The boundedness and decay for
the projection to the $\ell\geq 2$ spherical harmonics are implied by the
boundedness and decay for the Teukolsky system of spin $\pm2$ obtained in our

the Ch spectral class of asteroids as a proxy for hydrated asteroids, and use
published work about NEO delivery, main-belt taxonomic distributions, NEO
taxonomic distributions, and observed orbital distributions to estimate the
number of hydrated asteroids with different threshold sizes and at different
levels of accessibility. We expect 53 $\pm$ 27 Ch asteroids to be present in
the known population of NEOs $>$ 1 km diameter, and using two different
approaches to estimate accessibility we expect 17 $\pm$ 9 of them to be more
accessible on a round trip than the surface of the Moon. If there is no need to
define a minimum size, we expect 700 $\pm$ 350 hydrated objects that meet that
accessibility criterion. While there are few unknown NEOs larger than 1 km, the
population of smaller NEOs yet to be discovered could also be expected to
contain proportionally-many hydrated objects. Finally, we estimate that
hydrated NEOs are unlikely to bring enough water to account for the ice found

posts, or courses) is crucial in domains such as e-commerce, social networking,

an attractive solution to model the dynamic evolution of user and item
properties, where each user/item can be embedded in a euclidean space and its
evolution can be modeled by dynamic changes in embedding. However, existing
embedding methods either generate static embeddings, treat users and items
independently, or are not scalable.
  Here we present JODIE, a coupled recurrent model to jointly learn the dynamic
embeddings of users and items from a sequence of user-item interactions. JODIE
has three components. First, the update component updates the user and item
embedding from each interaction using their previous embeddings with the two
mutually-recursive Recurrent Neural Networks. Second, a novel projection
component is trained to forecast the embedding of users at any future time.
Finally, the prediction component directly predicts the embedding of the item
in a future interaction. For models that learn from a sequence of interactions,
traditional training data batching cannot be done due to complex user-user
dependencies. Therefore, we present a novel batching algorithm called t-Batch
that generates time-consistent batches of training data that can run in
parallel, giving massive speed-up.
  We conduct six experiments on two prediction tasks---future interaction
prediction and state change prediction---using four real-world datasets. We
show that JODIE outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms in these tasks by
up to 22.4%. Moreover, we show that JODIE is highly scalable and up to 9.2x

JODIE can predict student drop-out from courses five interactions in advance.

atomic linewidth is much less than the cavity linewidth. In the absence of
interactions, our system reduces to previously studied models of collective
fluorescence. We show that while interactions do not qualitatively change the
steady state properties, they lead to a drastic change in the dynamical
properties. We find that, for some interval of driving strengths, the system
shows two very distinct types of transient behaviors that depend on the initial
state of the system. In particular, there is a parameter regime where the
system features oscillatory dynamics with a period of oscillation that becomes

novel designs based on both HC and DP: A library of building blocks based on
partially HC are proposed to construct complex training algorithms without

techniques from DNNs with clustering has become a new research direction and
achieved some success. However, few studies have focused on the imbalanced-data
problem which commonly occurs in real-world applications. In this paper, we
propose a clustering method, regularized deep embedding clustering (RDEC), that
integrates virtual adversarial training (VAT), a network regularization
technique, with a clustering method called deep embedding clustering (DEC). DEC
optimizes cluster assignments by pushing data more densely around centroids in
latent space, but it is sometimes sensitive to the initial location of
centroids, especially in the case of imbalanced data, where the minor class has
less chance to be assigned a good centroid. RDEC introduces regularization
using VAT to ensure the model's robustness to local perturbations of data. VAT
pushes data that are similar in the original space closer together in the
latent space, bunching together data from minor classes and thereby
facilitating cluster identification by RDEC. Combining the advantages of DEC
and VAT, RDEC attains state-of-the-art performance on both balanced and
imbalanced benchmark/real-world datasets. For example, accuracies are as high
as 98.41% on MNIST dataset and 85.45% on a highly imbalanced dataset derived
from the MNIST, which is nearly 8% higher than the current best result.

attracted significant attention. Most studies focused on inertial focusing of
particles suspended within liquid phase, in which the ratio of the density of
the particle to that of the medium is O(1). the investigation on manipulation
of aerosol particles in an inertial microfluidics is very limited. In this
study, we numerically investigate the aerosol particle motion in a 3D straight
microchannel with rectangular cross section by fully resolved simulation of the
particle-air flow based on the contiuum model. The air flow is modeled by the
Navier-Stokes equations, and particle's motions, including transition and
rotation, are governed, respectively, by the Newton's second law and the Euler
equations without using any approximation models for the lift and drag forces.
The coupled mathematical model is numerically solved by combining immersed
boundary with lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM). We find that the Reynolds
numer, the particle's initial position, particle's density, and particle's
diameter are the influential parameters in this process. the equilibrium
positions and their stabilities of aerosols are different form those suspended
in liquid.

the vacuum amplitudes in self-interacting scalar $\lambda\phi^3$ and

$C\lambda^2\mu^{-2}$ in D=2, with $\mu$ being the scalar-field mass, or diverge

of first order importance because the previous literature focuses on $\mathrm
H_0': \mathrm{rank}(\Pi_0)= r$ by implicitly assuming away
$\mathrm{rank}(\Pi_0)<r$, which may lead to invalid rank tests due to
over-rejections. In particular, we show that limiting distributions of test
statistics under $\mathrm H_0'$ may not stochastically dominate those under
$\mathrm{rank}(\Pi_0)<r$. A multiple test on the nulls
$\mathrm{rank}(\Pi_0)=0,\ldots,r$, though valid, may be substantially
conservative. We employ a testing statistic whose limiting distributions under
$\mathrm H_0$ are highly nonstandard due to the inherent irregular natures of
the problem, and then construct bootstrap critical values that deliver size
control and improved power. Since our procedure relies on a tuning parameter, a
two-step procedure is designed to mitigate concerns on this nuisance. We
additionally argue that our setup is also important for estimation. We
illustrate the empirical relevance of our results through testing
identification in linear IV models that allows for clustered data and inference

a mystery: intangible, inexplicable, and beyond the reach of science. However,
science is making exciting headway into understanding creativity. While the
mind of a highly uncreative individual consists of a collection of items
accumulated through direct experience and enculturation, the mind of a creative
individual is self-organizing and self-mending; thus, experiences and items of
cultural knowledge are thought through from different perspectives such that
they cohere together into a loosely integrated whole. The reweaving of items in
memory is elicited by perturbations: experiences that increase psychological
entropy because they are inconsistent with one's web of understandings. The
process of responding to one perturbation often leads to other perturbations,
i.e., other inconsistencies in one's web of understandings. Creative thinking
often requires the capacity to shift between divergent and convergent modes of
thought in response to the ever-changing demands of the creative task. Since
uncreative individuals can reap the benefits of creativity by imitating
creators, using their inventions, or purchasing their artworks, it is not
necessary that everyone be creative. Agent based computer models of cultural
evolution suggest that society functions best with a mixture of creative and
uncreative individuals. The ideal ratio of creativity to imitation increases in
times of change, such as we are experiencing now. Therefore it is important to
educate the next generation in ways that foster creativity. The chapter
concludes with suggestions for how educational systems can cultivate
creativity.

the potential of a field has a discrete symmetry that is spontaneously broken.
Since this condition is commonplace in field theory, it is plausible that many
of these walls were produced at some point in the early universe. Moreover, for
potentials with a rich enough structure, the walls can join and form a (at
large scales) homogeneous and isotropic network that dominates the energy
density of the universe for some time before decaying. In this thesis, we study
the faith of large scale perturbations in a cosmology with a short period of
domain wall dominance. Treating the domain wall network as a relativistic
elastic solid at large scales, we show that the perturbations that exited the
horizon during inflation get suppressed during the domain wall era, before
re-entering the horizon. This power suppression occurs because, unlike a
fluid-like universe, a solid-like universe can support sizable anisotropic
stress gradients across large scales which effectively act as mass for the
scalar and tensor modes. Interestingly, the amplitude of the primordial scalar
power spectrum can be closer to one in this cosmology and still give the
observed value of $10^{-9}$ today. As a result, the usual bounds on the energy
scale of inflation get relaxed to values closer to the (more natural) Planck
scale. In the last part of this thesis, as an existence proof, we present a
hybrid inflation model with $N$ `waterfall' fields that can realize the
proposed cosmology. In this model, a domain wall network forms when an
approximate $O(N)$ symmetry gets spontaneously broken at the end of inflation,
and for $N \geq 5$, we show that there is a region in parameter space where the
network dominates the energy density for a few e-folds before decaying and
reheating the universe.

multi-agent policy gradient method that frames objects as cooperative agents,
and then directly maximizes a graph-level metric as the reward. In particular,
to assign the reward properly to each agent, CMAT uses a counterfactual
baseline that disentangles the agent-specific reward by fixing the dynamics of
other agents. Extensive validations on the challenging Visual Genome benchmark
show that CMAT achieves a state-of-the-art by significant performance gains

can raise its head up to several tens of centimeters. The effective elastic
modulus is enhanced by increasing the pressure of air trapped inside the
respiration channel, which is similar to increasing the stiffness of a thin
plastic tube by filling it with air at pressure above atmospheric pressure. The
neck height increases with the effective elastic modulus according to a scaling
relationship. It was also simply proved that the peak of force or constriction
pressure is proportional to the snakes diameter. This work may provide a
physical foundation underlying the mechanical properties of slender animals.

terms of its accuracy for years. However, few of the developed solutions have
been deployed in practice to satisfy the localization demand of today's smart

smart devices under certain conditions due to their microphone's nonlinearity.
Inspired by this insight, this work revisits the ultrasonic positioning
technique and builds a practical UPS, called UPS+ for ultrasound-incapable
smart devices. The core concept is to deploy two types of indoor beacon
devices, which will advertise ultrasonic beacons at two different ultrasonic
frequencies respectively. Their superimposed beacons are shifted to a
low-frequency by virtue of the nonlinearity effect at the receiver's
microphone. This underlying property functions as an implicit ultrasonic
downconverter without throwing harm to the hearing system of humans. We
demonstrate UPS+, a fully functional UPS prototype, with centimeter-level

a novel multi-task learning scheme that utilizes multi-view attention learned
from various perspectives to enable these tasks to interact with each other as

reconstruction methods for inverse elastic scattering problems with phaseless
far field data. Systematically, we study two basic models, i.e., inverse
scattering of plane waves by rigid bodies and inverse scattering of sources
with compact support. For both models, we show that the location of the objects
can not be uniquely recovered by the data. To solve this problem, we consider
simultaneously the incident point sources with one fixed source point and at
most three scattering strengths. We then establish some uniqueness results for
source scattering problem with multi-frequency phaseless far field data.
Furthermore, a fast and stable phase retrieval approach is proposed based on a
simple geometric result which provides a stable reconstruction of a point in
the plane from three distances to given points. Difficulties arise for inverse
scattering by rigid bodies due to the additional unknown far field pattern of
the point sources. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce an artificial
rigid body into the system and show that the underlying rigid bodies can be
uniquely determined by the corresponding phaseless far field data at a fixed
frequency. Noting that the far field pattern of the scattered field
corresponding to point sources is very small if the source point is far away
from the scatterers, we propose an appropriate phase retrieval method for
obstacle scattering problems, without using the artificial rigid body. Finally,
we propose several sampling methods for shape reconstruction with phaseless far
field data. Extended numerical examples in two dimensions are conducted with
noisy data, and the results further verify the effectiveness and robustness of
the proposed phase retrieval techniques and sampling methods.

theory. Despite a tremendous amount of research on the subject, there is still
no satisfactory solution that can scale to billion-scale complex networks.
Labelling-based methods are well-known for rendering fast response time to
distance queries; however, existing works can only construct labelling on
moderately large networks (million-scale) and cannot scale to large networks
(billion-scale) due to their prohibitively large space requirements and very
long preprocessing time. In this work, we present novel techniques to
efficiently construct distance labelling and process exact shortest path
distance queries for complex networks with billions of vertices and billions of
edges. Our method is based on two ingredients: (i) a scalable labelling
algorithm for constructing minimal distance labelling, and (ii) a querying
framework that supports fast distance-bounded search on a sparsified graph.
Thus, we first develop a novel labelling algorithm that can scale to graphs at
the billion-scale. Then, we formalize a querying framework for exact distance
queries, which combines our proposed highway cover distance labelling with
distance-bounded searches to enable fast distance computation. To speed up the
labelling construction process, we further propose a parallel labelling method
that can construct labelling simultaneously for multiple landmarks. We
evaluated the performance of the proposed methods on 12 real-world networks.
The experiments show that the proposed methods can not only handle networks
with billions of vertices, but also be up to 70 times faster in constructing
labelling and save up to 90\% of labelling space. In particular, our method can
answer distance queries on a billion-scale network of around 8B edges in less
than 1ms, on average.

observable in this approach and can be used to extract energies for each
particle-number sector. Since in one dimension non-relativistic fermions can
only permute due to boundary effects, unlike the auxiliary field method, in

photons penetrate through an object, causing a nonlinear projection data. When
a linear reconstruction algorithm, such as filtered backprojection, is applied
to reconstruct the projection data, beam hardening artifacts which show as
cupping and streaks are present in the CT image. The aim of this study was to
develop a fast and accurate beam hardening correction method which can deal
with beam hardening artifacts induced by multi-materials objects. Based on
spectrum estimation, the nonlinear attenuation process of the X-ray projection
was modeled by reprojecting a template image with the estimated polychromatic
spectrum. The template images were obtained by segmenting the uncorrected into
different components using a simple segmentation algorithm. Numerical
simulations, experimental phantom data and animal data which were acquired on a

controversially discussed. One reason for the difficulty to overcome the
controversy is the lack of a universal, but also precise, quantitative
definition of efficiency that is able to graduate between different states of
efficiency. The main purpose of this article is to fill this gap by developing
a measure for the efficiency of markets that fulfill all the stated
requirements. It is shown that the new definition of efficiency, based on
informational-entropy, is equivalent to the two most used definitions of
efficiency from Fama and Jensen. The new measure therefore enables steps to
settle the dispute over the state of efficiency in markets. Moreover, it is
shown that inefficiency in a market can either arise from the possibility to
use information to predict an event with higher than chance level, or can
emerge from wrong pricing/ quotes that do not reflect the right probabilities
of possible events. Finally, the calculation of efficiency is demonstrated on a
simple game (of coin tossing), to show how one could exactly quantify the
efficiency in any market-like system, if all probabilities are known.

distributed sensing-data over wireless-channels for function-computation,

developed technology called over-the-air computing (AirComp) can dramatically
reduce the WDA latency by aggregating distributed data ""over-the-air"" using the
waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel. In this work, we
design multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) AirComp for computing a
vector-valued function in a clustered IoT network with multi-antenna sensors
forming clusters and a multi-antenna access-point (AP) performing WDA. The
resultant high-dimensional but low-rank MIMO channels makes it important to
reduce channel or signal dimensionality in AirComp to avoid exposure to noise
from channel null-spaces. Motivated by this, we develop a framework of
reduced-dimension MIMO AirComp, featuring decomposed-aggregation-beamforming
(DAB). Consider the case of separable channel-clusters with non-overlapping
angle-of-arrival ranges. The optimal DAB has the structure where
inner-components extract the dominant eigen-spaces of corresponding
channel-clusters and outer-components jointly equalize the resultant
low-dimensional channels. Consider the more complex case of inseparable
clusters. We propose a suboptimal DAB design where the inner-component performs
both dimension-reduction and joint-equalization over clustered-channel
covariance matrices and the outer-component jointly equalizes the small-scale
fading-channels. Furthermore, efficient algorithms for rank-optimization of
individual DAB components and channel-feedback leveraging the AirComp principle
are developed.

inductive bias into the encoder-decoder image captioning framework for more
human-like captions. Intuitively, we humans use the inductive bias to compose
collocations and contextual inference in discourse. For example, when we see
the relation `person on bike', it is natural to replace `on' with `ride' and
infer `person riding bike on a road' even the `road' is not evident. Therefore,
exploiting such bias as a language prior is expected to help the conventional
encoder-decoder models less likely overfit to the dataset bias and focus on
reasoning. Specifically, we use the scene graph --- a directed graph
($\mathcal{G}$) where an object node is connected by adjective nodes and
relationship nodes --- to represent the complex structural layout of both image
($\mathcal{I}$) and sentence ($\mathcal{S}$). In the textual domain, we use
SGAE to learn a dictionary ($\mathcal{D}$) that helps to reconstruct sentences
in the $\mathcal{S}\rightarrow \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \mathcal{D} \rightarrow
\mathcal{S}$ pipeline, where $\mathcal{D}$ encodes the desired language prior;
in the vision-language domain, we use the shared $\mathcal{D}$ to guide the
encoder-decoder in the $\mathcal{I}\rightarrow \mathcal{G}\rightarrow
\mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}$ pipeline. Thanks to the scene graph
representation and shared dictionary, the inductive bias is transferred across
domains in principle. We validate the effectiveness of SGAE on the challenging
MS-COCO image captioning benchmark, e.g., our SGAE-based single-model achieves
a new state-of-the-art $127.8$ CIDEr-D on the Karpathy split, and a competitive
$125.5$ CIDEr-D (c40) on the official server even compared to other ensemble

we examine the dissipation rates for decaying incompressible
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence with increasing Reynolds number, and in
the presence of a mean magnetic field of varying strength. Proceeding
numerically, we find that as the Reynolds number increases, the dissipation
rate asymptotes to a finite value for each magnetic field strength, confirming
the K\'arm\'an-Howarth hypothesis as applied to MHD. The asymptotic value of
the dimensionless dissipation rate is initially suppressed from the
zero-mean-field value by the mean magnetic field but then approaches a constant
value for higher values of the mean field strength. Additionally, for
comparison, we perform a set of two-dimensional (2DMHD) and a set of reduced
MHD (RMHD) simulations. We find that the RMHD results lie very close to the
values corresponding to the high mean-field limit of the three-dimensional runs
while the 2DMHD results admit distinct values far from both the zero mean field
cases and the high mean field limit of the three-dimensional cases. These
findings provide firm underpinnings for numerous applications in space and

metal layers of Al, Au, and Ti and the bottom Al2O3 substrate. In these
nanoscale structures with hetero- and homo-junctions, we observe that the
thermal boundary resistance (TBR) is significantly enhanced as the number of
WSe2 layers increases. In particular, as the metal is changed from Al, to Au,
and to Ti, we find an interesting trend of TBR depending on the WSe2 thickness;
when referenced to TBR for a system without WSe2, TBR for n=1 decreases, but
that for n=2 increases. This result clearly demonstrates that the stronger
bonding for Ti leads to a better thermal conduction between the metal and the
WSe2 layer, but in return gives rise to a large mismatch in the phonon density
of states between the first and second WSe2 layers so that the WSe2-WSe2
interface becomes a major thermal resistance for n=2. By using photoemission
spectroscopy and optical second harmonic generation technique, we confirm that
the metallization induces a change in the valence state of W-ions, and also
recovers a non-centrosymmetry for the bi-layered WSe2.

prognosis is important for guiding sequential treatment and improving the

to assess tumor radiosensitivity for devising the optimal treatment strategy.
Previous studies focused on gene expression in cells closely associated with
radiosensitivity, but factors such as the response of a cancer patient to
irradiation and the patient survival time are largely ignored. For clinical
cancer treatment, a specific pre-treatment indicator taking into account cancer
cell type and patient radiosensitivity is of great value but it has been
missing. Here, we propose an effective indicator for radiosensitivity:
radiosensitive gene group centrality (RSGGC), which characterizes the
importance of the group of genes that are radiosensitive in the whole gene
correlation network. We demonstrate, using both clinical patient data and
experimental cancer cell lines, which RSGGC can provide a quantitative estimate
of the effect of radiotherapy, with factors such as the patient survival time
and the survived fraction of cancer cell lines under radiotherapy fully taken
into account. Our main finding is that, for patients with a higher RSGGC score
before radiotherapy, cancer treatment tends to be more effective. The RSGGC can
have significant applications in clinical prognosis, serving as a key measure
to classifying radiosensitive and radioresistant patients.

modulate seriously the domain structure and wall transport. Here, we
demonstrate an observation and manipulation of conductive domain walls confined

conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM), we are able to distinctly visualize
various types of conductive domain walls, including the head-to-head charged

infinity and double poles of analytical scattering coefficients. The scattering
theories for both ZBC and NZBCs are addressed. The direct problem establishes
the analyticity, symmetries and asymptotic behavior of the Jost solutions and
scattering matrix, and properties of discrete spectra. The inverse problems are
formulated and solved with the aid of the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problems, and
the reconstruction formulae, trace formulae and theta conditions are also
posed. In particular, the IST with NZBCs at infinity is proposed by a suitable
uniformization variable, which allows the scattering problem to be solved on a
standard complex plane instead of a two-sheeted Riemann surface. The
reflectionless potentials with double poles for the ZBC and NZBCs are both
carried out explicitly by means of determinants. Some representative
semi-rational bright-bright soliton, dark-bright soliton, and breather-breather
solutions are examined in detail. These results will be useful to further
explore and apply the related nonlinear wave phenomena.

compressibility are negligible, the propagation of fluids in channels is
governed by a balance between fluid viscosity and elasticity of the surrounding

non-Newtonian fluids are particularly of interest due to the dependence of
viscosity on the state of the system. In this work, we study the
fluid-structure interaction dynamics between an incompressible non-Newtonian
fluid and a slender linearly elastic cylinder under the creeping flow regime.
Considering power-law fluids and applying the thin shell approximation for the
elastic cylinder, we obtain a non-homogeneous p-Laplacian equation governing
the viscous-elastic dynamics. We present exact solutions for the pressure and
deformation fields for various initial and boundary conditions for both
shear-thinning and shear-thickening fluids. We show that in contrast to Stokes'
problem where a compactly supported front is obtained for shear-thickening
fluids, here the role of viscosity is inversed and such fronts are obtained for
shear-thinning fluids. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for the case of a step
in inlet pressure, the propagation rate of the front has a $t^{\frac{n}{n+1}}$
dependence on time ($t$), suggesting the ability to indirectly measure the
power-law index ($n$) of shear-thinning liquids through measurements of elastic

In this paper we propose a novel few-shot learning method called meta-transfer

Specifically, ""meta"" refers to training multiple tasks, and ""transfer"" is
achieved by learning scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each
task. In addition, we introduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an
effective learning curriculum for MTL. We conduct experiments using (5-class,
1-shot) and (5-class, 5-shot) recognition tasks on two challenging few-shot

time intervals are not constant, small time-shifts have no significant effect,

criteria that we require for the modeling are providing robustness against
time-shifts or timestamps uncertainty as well as maintaining the essential
capabilities of time-series models, i.e., forgetting meaningless past
information and handling infinite sequences. The proposed method handles them
with a convolutional mechanism across time with specific parameterizations,
which efficiently represents the event dependencies in a time-shift invariant
manner while discounting the effect of past events, and a dynamic pooling
mechanism, which provides robustness against the uncertainty in timestamps and
enhances the time-discounting capability by dynamically changing the pooling
window size. In our learning algorithm, the decaying and dynamic pooling
mechanisms play critical roles in handling infinite and variable length
sequences. Numerical experiments on real-world event sequences with ambiguous
timestamps and ordinary time series demonstrated the advantages of our method.

years with increasing network depth and width. To enable DNNs on edge devices

including pruning, quantization and factorization. Among the
factorization-based approaches, low-rank approximation has been widely adopted
because of its solid theoretical rationale and efficient implementations.
Several previous works attempted to directly approximate a pre-trained model by
low-rank decomposition; however, small approximation errors in parameters can
ripple a large prediction loss. As a result, performance usually drops
significantly and a sophisticated fine-tuning is required to recover accuracy.
We argue that it is not optimal to separate low-rank approximation from
training. Unlike previous works, this paper integrates low rank approximation
and regularization into the training. We propose Trained Rank Pruning (TRP),
which iterates low rank approximation and training. TRP maintains the capacity
of original network while imposes low-rank constraints during training. A
stochastic sub-gradient descent optimized nuclear regularization is utilized to
further encourage low rank in TRP. The TRP trained network has low-rank
structure in nature, and can be approximated with negligible performance loss,
eliminating fine-tuning after low rank approximation. The methods are
comprehensively evaluated on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, outperforming previous
compression methods using low rank approximation. Code is available:

an extension of this model, with batch arrivals and exceptional first service,
to road traffic situations involving multiple streams of conflicting traffic.
In particular, we use it in the context of gap acceptance models where
low-priority traffic needs to cross (or, depending on the application, merge
with) another traffic flow of higher priority.
  Traditionally, gap acceptance models are based on the $M/G/1$ queue with
exceptional first service, in this application area commonly referred to as the
$M/G2/1$ queue. In an earlier study, we showed how the $M^X/SM/1$ queue with
exceptional first service can be applied in this context to extend the model
with driver impatience and more realistic merging behaviour. In this paper, we
show how this same queueing system can be used to model a Markov modulated
Poisson arrival process of the high-priority traffic stream. Due to its
flexibility, this arrival process is very relevant in this application,
particularly because it allows the modelling of platoon forming of vehicles.
The correlated inter-arrival times of these high priority vehicles cause the
merging times of two subsequent low priority vehicles to become dependent as
well (as they correspond with the service times in the underlying queueing
model). We derive the waiting time and sojourn time distributions of an
arbitrary customer, showing that these depend on the position of the customer
inside the batch, as well as on the type of the first customer in the batch.

pairwise-communication using Gossip-like protocols, called Elastic Gossip. This

to generate a bending wave that pushes against the water and produces thrust.
Here, we use a 3D computational fluid dynamics model coupled to the motion of
the fish with prescribed deformation to study the basic mechanical quantities
along the fish's body: force, torque, and power. We find that forces on the
bodies of both the anguilliform swimmer and the carangiform swimmer are
dominated by reactive forces; furthermore, the force on the caudal fin of the
carangiform swimmer is dominated by drag-like forces. The torque exhibits a
wave pattern that travels faster than the curvature wave in both the
anguilliform and carangiform swimmers, but the wave speed is even higher for
the carangiform swimmer. The power output for the anguilliform swimmer is
concentrated on the anterior half of the body and is significantly negative on
the posterior side of the body. In contrast, most of the power is generated by
the posterior part of the body before the peduncle for the carangiform swimmer.
The results explain the differences in the observed electromyography patterns
in fish with different swimming modes and explain the tendon function in
carangiform swimmers.

vertex is part of a uniform even number of edges. Hence every vertex in the
graph $\hat{G}$ that is the $1$-skeleton of $\hat{K}$ has an even degree, which
makes $\hat{G}$ Eulerian, i.e., it is guaranteed to contain an Eulerian tour.
Meshes whose edges admit Eulerian tours are crucial in coverage problems
arising in several applications including 3D printing and robotics.
  For $2$-complexes in $\mathbb{R}^2$ ($d=2$) under mild assumptions (that no
two adjacent edges of a $2$-cell in $K$ are boundary edges), we show that the
Euler transformed $2$-complex $\hat{K}$ has a geometric realization in

bound the numbers of vertices, edges, and $2$-cells in $\hat{K}$ as small
scalar multiples of the corresponding numbers in $K$. We prove corresponding
results for $3$-complexes in $\mathbb{R}^3$ under an additional assumption that
the degree of a vertex in each $3$-cell containing it is $3$. In this setting,
every vertex in $\hat{G}$ is shown to have a degree of $6$.

  Deciding if the star dichromatic number of a digraph is at most $p$ is

the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric extension of spinor models --- the recipe that
does not produce instability of the linear Dirac equation. Having exemplified
the physical origins of the $\mathcal P$- and $\mathcal T$-breaking terms, we
consider the extensions of three U(1)-invariant spinor models with cubic

shown to be completely integrable and possess infinitely many conserved
quantities. The \PT-symmetric Gross-Neveu equation conserves energy and
momentum but does not conserve charge. The third model is introduced for the
purpose of comparison with the previous two; its \PT-symmetric extension has no
conservation laws at all. Despite this dramatic difference in the integrability
and conservation properties, all three \PT-symmetric models are shown to have
exact soliton solutions. Similar to the solitons of the extended Thirring and
Gross-Neveu equations, the solitons of the new model are found to be stable ---
except for a narrow band of frequencies adjacent to the soliton existence
boundary. The persistence under the $\mathcal P$- and $\mathcal T$-breaking
perturbations as well as the prevalence of stability highlight a remarkable
sturdiness of spinor solitons in (1+1) dimensions.

Anisotropic electronic transport is found to persist under considerable

perforations enables spin filtering of the transmitted electrons, resulting in
a half-metallic anisotropic transport regime. Our findings point towards a
co-integration of charge and spin control in a two-dimensional platform of

The main advantage of the described method is its generality, which implicitly

  forecasts",,,,,"q-fin.ST stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate forecasts of electricity spot prices are essential to the daily
operational and planning decisions made by power producers and distributors.
Typically, point forecasts of these quantities suffice, particularly in the
Nord Pool market where the large quantity of hydro power leads to price
stability. However, when situations become irregular, deviations on the price
scale can often be extreme and difficult to pinpoint precisely, which is a
result of the highly varying marginal costs of generating facilities at the
edges of the load curve. In these situations it is useful to supplant a point
forecast of price with a distributional forecast, in particular one whose tails
are adaptive to the current production regime. This work outlines a methodology
for leveraging published bid/ask information from the Nord Pool market to
construct such adaptive predictive distributions. Our methodology is a
non-standard application of the concept of error-dressing, which couples a
feature driven error distribution in volume space with a non-linear
transformation via the published bid/ask curves to obtain highly non-symmetric,
adaptive price distributions. Using data from the Nord Pool market, we show
that our method outperforms more standard forms of distributional modeling. We
further show how such distributions can be used to render `warning systems'
that issue reliable probabilities of prices exceeding various important
thresholds.

precise transit timing over a course of decades. The rate of planetary
in-spiralling may not only help us to understand some aspects of evolution of
planetary systems, but also can be used as a probe of the stellar internal
structure. In this paper we present results of transit timing campaigns
organised for a carefully selected sample of hot Jupiter-like planets which
were found to be the best candidates for detecting planet-star tidal
interactions on the Northern hemisphere. Among them, there is the WASP-12
system which is the best candidate for possessing an in-falling giant

WASP-12 b and allow us to refine its rate. The derived tidal quality parameter
of the host star Q'_{*} = (1.82 +/- 0.32) x 10^5 is in agreement with
theoretical predictions for subgiant stars. For the remaining systems -
HAT-P-23, KELT-1, KELT-16, WASP-33, and WASP-103 - our transit timing data
reveal no deviations from the constant-period models, hence constraints on the
individual rates of orbital decay were placed. The tidal quality parameters of
host stars in at least 4 systems - HAT-P-23, KELT-1, WASP-33, and WASP-103 -
were found to be greater than the value reported for WASP-12. This is in line
with the finding that those hosts are main sequence stars, for which efficiency
of tidal dissipation is predicted to be relatively weak.

ordered at the molecular level below 118 K. This is also near the temperature
at which the system structurally transitions from triclinic to a unique
near-cubic phase. High-precision measurements of the near-static dielectric
constant reveal that the structural phase transition is actually comprised of
four successive transformations upon cooling at T$_1$=110.7 K, T$_2$=109.5 K,
T$_3$=109.1 K and T$_4$=107.8 K. In contrast to warming, only two transitions
occur at T'$_4$=119.2 K and T'$_1$=120.9 K. The methyl groups in the near-cubic
phase become slightly distorted according to existing neutron powder
diffraction measurements. Analysis of the 2$^6$=64 possible spin orientation
configurations of the methyl groups reveal a 20-fold ground state degeneracy
presiding in each molecule rendering the system to become highly unstable. From
such, it is interpreted that T$_1$ and T$_2$ are temperatures at which the
molecules successively lower their symmetry to remove the energy degeneracy
which involve methyl group elongation and further out-of-plane tilting. This
triggers the system to phase transition into the near-cubic phase which
involves a shearing of the molecular planes and partial rotation of the methyl
groups at T$_3$ and T$_4$. We interpret the low temperature near-cubic phase to
be a manifestation of Jahn-Teller distortions based on energy degeneracies of
the orbital motion of protons in each molecule and suggest that the metastable
nature of the phase transition originates from the methyl groups requiring a
larger amount of energy to order than to disorder. Our findings help explain
why many unusual structural phase transitions occur at low temperatures in
other molecular crystals possessing periodic motion of protons.

annealing of GaN NW-ensembles, post AlN-capping, leads to selective

multivariate polynomials which admit a decomposition in sum of squares and up

and destabilization of a liquid sheet or jet. The disadvantage of such
atomization processes is that the breakup is often highly irregular, causing a
broad distribution of droplet sizes. As these sizes are controlled by the
ligament corrugation and size, a monodisperse spray should consist of ligaments
that are both smooth and of equal size. A straightforward way of creating
smooth and equally sized ligaments is by droplet impact on a mesh. In this work
we show that this approach does however not produce monodisperse droplets, but
instead the droplet size distribution is very broad, with a large number of
small satellite drops. We demonstrate that the fragmentation is controlled by a
jet instability, where initial perturbations caused by the injection process
result in long-wavelength disturbances that determine the final ligament
breakup. During destabilization the crests of these disturbances are connected
by thin ligaments which are the leading cause of the large number of small
droplets. A secondary coalescence process, due to small relative velocities
between droplets, partly masks this effect by reducing the amount of small
droplets. Of the many parameters in this system, we describe the effect of

(PS-DCT), for the task of speaker identification. These features are obtained
directly from the voiced segments of the speech signal, without any preemphasis
or windowing. The feature vectors are vector quantized, to create one separate
codebook for each speaker during training. The performance of the PS-DCT
features is shown to be good, and hence it can be used to supplement other
features for the speaker identification task. Speaker identification is also
performed using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features and combined
with the proposed features to improve its performance. For this pilot study, 30
speakers (14 female and 16 male) have been picked up randomly from the TIMIT
database for the speaker identification task. On this data, both the proposed
features and MFCC give an identification accuracy of 90% and 96.7% for codebook
sizes of 16 and 32, respectively, and the combined features achieve 100%
performance. Apart from the speaker identification task, this work also shows
the capability of DCT to capture discriminative information from the speech
signal with minimal pre-processing.

equations or the full Navier-Stokes equations. The dominant prograde,
superrotating zonal jet is markedly different between the simulations which are
performed using practically identical numerical setups, within the same model.
The differences arise due to the breakdown of the so-called `shallow-fluid' and
traditional approximations, which worsens when rotation rates are slowed, and
day-night temperature contrasts are increased. The changes in the zonal
advection between simulations solving the full and simplified equations, give
rise to significant differences in the atmospheric redistribution of heat,
altering the position of the hottest part of the atmosphere and temperature
contrast between the day and night sides. The implications for the atmospheric
chemistry and, therefore, observations need to be studied with a model
including a more detailed treatment of the radiative transfer and chemistry.
Small Neptunes and super Earths are extremely abundant and important,
potentially bridging the structural properties (mass, radius, composition) of
terrestrial and gas giant planets. Our results indicate care is required when

is detected in the near-infrared He I triplet at 10830 \AA{} in all three
transits. During mid-transit, the mean absorption level is $0.88\pm0.04$ %
measured in a $\pm$10 km s$^{-1}$ range at a net blueshift of $-3.5\pm0.4$ km
s$^{-1}$ (10829.84--10830.57 \AA{}). The absorption signal exhibits radial
velocities of $+6.5\pm3.1$ km s$^{-1}$ and $-12.6\pm1.0$ km s$^{-1}$ during
ingress and egress, respectively; measured in the planetary rest frame. We show
that stellar activity related pseudo-signals interfere with the planetary
atmospheric absorption signal. They could contribute as much as 80% of the
observed signal and might also affect the radial velocity signature, but
pseudo-signals are very unlikely to explain the entire signal. The observed
line ratio between the two unresolved and the third line of the He I triplet is
$2.8\pm0.2$, which strongly deviates from the value expected for an optically
thin atmospheres. When interpreted in terms of absorption in the planetary
atmosphere, this favors a compact helium atmosphere with an extent of only 0.2
planetary radii and a substantial column density on the order of $4\times
10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. The observed radial velocities can be understood either in
terms of atmospheric circulation with equatorial superrotation or as a sign of
an asymmetric atmospheric component of evaporating material. We detect no clear
signature of ongoing evaporation, like pre- or post-transit absorption, which
could indicate material beyond the planetary Roche lobe, or radial velocities
in excess of the escape velocity. These findings do not contradict planetary
evaporation, but only show that the detected helium absorption in HD 189733 b
does not trace the atmospheric layers that show pronounced escape signatures.

model two-phase flows with large density differences by solving Cahn-Hilliard

maintain a hyperbolic tangent property of the interface profile and conserve
the volume, an interfacial profile correction term and a flux correction term
are added into the original Cahn-Hilliard equation respectively. By using a
fractional step scheme, the modified Cahn-Hilliard equation is split into two
sub-equations. One is solved in the framework of lattice Boltzmann equation
method. The other is solved by the finite difference method. Compared with the
previous lattice Boltzmann methods, the proposed method is able to maintain the
order parameter within a physically meaningful range, which is conductive to
track the interface accurately. In addition, the multi-relaxation-time
collision model and a high-order compact selective filter operation are
employed to enhance the numerical stability. The proposed method can simulate
two-phase fluid flows with the density ratio up to $1000$. In order to validate

evolution of cooperation has traditionally been studied for well-mixed

for structured populations using evolutionary graph theory. The population
structures arising due to cellular arrangement in tissues however are dynamic

this work we compare the conditions for cooperative success in an epithelium
modelled using evolutionary graph theory, to those in a mechanical model of an
epithelium =- the Voronoi tessellation model. Crucially, in this latter model
cells are able to move, and birth and death are not spatially coupled. We
calculate fixation probabilities in the Voronoi tessellation model through

stronger promotion of cooperation in comparison with the evolutionary graph

the proposed work, the SDN controller periodically monitors flow level

links. For load balancing the identified largest flow and further traffic
through these bottleneck links are rerouted through the lightly-loaded

when the network traffic increases the proposed method efficiently re-routes
the flows and balance the network load which substantially improves the network

reversals are often associated with changed oculomotor behaviour (Frassle et
al., 2014; Fujiwara et al., 2017). Specifically, the direction of smooth
pursuit phases in optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) typically corresponds to the
direction of motion that dominates perceptual appearance at any given time.
Here we report an improved analysis that continuously estimates perceived
motion in terms of `cumulative smooth pursuit'. In essence, smooth pursuit
segments are identified, interpolated where necessary, and joined
probabilistically into a continuous record of `cumulative smooth pursuit'
(i.e., a probability of eye position disregarding blinks, saccades, signal
losses, and artefacts). The analysis is fully automated and robust in healthy,
developmental, and patient populations. To validate reliability, we compare
volitional reports of perceptual reversals in rivalry displays, and of physical
reversals in non-rivalrous control displays. `Cumulative smooth pursuit'
detects physical reversals and estimates eye velocity more accurately than
existing methods do (Frassle et al., 2014). It also appears to distinguish
dominant and transitional perceptual states, detecting changes with a precision
of $\pm100\,\mathit{ms}$. We conclude that `cumulative smooth pursuit'
significantly improves the monitoring of binocular rivalry by means of
recording OKN.

proposed architecture in a staged approach. To aid the process of training and
inference, hand segmentation masks are also estimated in such an intermediate

an RGB image and an aligned depth map. Based on HandRGBD, we explore variants
of the proposed approach in an ablative study and determine the best performing

The
eruption of a filament is often associated with coronal mass ejection (CME),
which has an adverse effect on space weather. Hence, the study of filament has
attracted much attention in the recent past. The tilt angle of active region
(AR) magnetic bipoles is a crucial parameter in the context of the solar
dynamo. It governs the conversion efficiency of the toroidal magnetic field to
poloidal magnetic field. The filament always forms over the Polarity Inversion
Lines (PILs). So the study of tilt angles of the filament can provide valuable
information about generation of magnetic field in the Sun. We study the tilt
angle of filaments and other properties of it using McIntosh archive data. We
fit a straight line to each filament to estimate its tilt angle. We study the
variation of mean tilt angle with time. The latitude distribution of positive
tilt angle filaments and negative tilt angle filaments reveal that there is a
dominance of positive tilt angle filaments in the southern hemisphere and
negative tilt angle filaments dominate in the northern hemisphere. We study the
variation of the mean tilt angle for low and high latitude separately. Study of
temporal variation of filament number reveals that total filament number and
low latitude filament number varies cyclically, in phase with the solar cycle.
The number of filaments in high latitude is less, and they also show a cyclic
pattern in temporal variation. We also study the north-south asymmetry of
filament for different latitude criteria.

We have developed and applied a code for kinematic substructure detection to a
sample of 412 galaxy clusters drawn from the \citet[]{tempel2012} catalogue,
finding a frequency of substructures of 45\%. We have extracted mean stellar
ages with the {\sc{starlight}} spectral synthesis code applied to SDSS-III
spectra of the sample galaxies. We found lower mean stellar ages in unrelaxed
clusters relative to relaxed clusters. For unrelaxed clusters, we separated
primary and secondary subhalos and found that, while relaxed clusters and
primaries present similar masses and age distributions, secondaries present
younger stellar populations, mainly due to low-mass galaxies ($\log
M_\star/M_\odot \lesssim 11$\,dex). An age-clustercentric radius relation is
seen for all subhalos irrespective of the presence of substructures. We also
observe relations between the mean stellar age and mass of relaxed and
unrelaxed clusters, massive systems presenting higher mean ages. The locus of
these relations is distinct between relaxed and unrelaxed clusters, but become
indistinguishable when separating primaries and secondaries. Our results
suggest that differences between relaxed and unrelaxed clusters are mainly
driven by low-mass systems in the clusters outskirts, and that, while
pre-processing can be seen in the subcomponents of dynamically young clusters,
some evolution in the stellar populations must occur during the clusters
relaxation.

code in which a given code symbol can be recovered by taking a linear
combination of at most $r$ other code symbols with $r << k$. A natural
extension is to the local recovery of a set of $t$ erased symbols. There have
been several approaches proposed for the handling of multiple erasures. The
approach considered here, is one of sequential recovery meaning that the $t$
erased symbols are recovered in succession, each time contacting at most $r$
other symbols for assistance in recovery. Under the constraint that each erased
symbol be recoverable by contacting at most $r$ other code symbols, this
approach is the most general and hence offers maximum possible code rate. We
characterize the maximum possible rate of an LRC with sequential recovery for
any $r \geq 3$ and $t$. We do this by first deriving an upper bound on code
rate and then going on to construct a {\em binary} code that achieves this
optimal rate. The upper bound derived here proves a conjecture made earlier
relating to the structure (but not the exact form) of the rate bound. Our
approach also permits us to deduce the structure of the parity-check matrix of
a rate-optimal LRC with sequential recovery.
  The parity-check matrix in turn, leads to a graphical description of the
code. The construction of a binary code having rate achieving the upper bound
derived here makes use of this description. Interestingly, it turns out that a
subclass of binary codes that are both rate and block-length optimal,
correspond to graphs known as Moore graphs that are regular graphs having the
smallest number of vertices for a given girth. A connection with Tornado codes
is also made in the paper.

the thermal fluctuations within valleys of the energy landscape are covered,
the crossing of energy barriers from one valley into another usually is

on explorations of the energy landscape - that the crossing of energy barriers
can be attributed by an effective decrease of the glass transition packing
fraction with increasing temperature T according to T^{0.2}. Furthermore, we
reanalyzing data of soft sphere simulations. Since fitting scaling laws to
simulation data always allows for some arbitrariness, we cannot prove based on
the simulation data that our idea of a shift of the glass transition packing
fraction due to barrier crossings is the only possible way to explain the
discrepancies that have been observed previously. However, we show that a
possible explanation of the simulation data is given by our approach to
characterize the dynamics of soft spheres by both, the previously-considered
temperature-dependent effective packing fraction due to the increase of the
mean overlap between neighboring particles with stronger thermal fluctuations
and the newly introduced increase of the glass transition packing with an
increasing probability of barrier crossings.

yields per Z trigger $R_{jZ}$ and the modification of azimuthal angle
correlation $\Delta \phi_{jZ}$. We also demonstrate that it is the energy loss
effect on multi-jets from high-order corrections that leads to the suppression
of the Z+jet correlation at small azimuthal angle difference $\Delta \phi_{jZ}$
and at small $x_{jZ}$. The jet shape reflecting transverse momentum
distribution inside the jet is also calculated, which indicates that large
fraction of jet energy is carried away from the jet axis in Pb+Pb collisions.

to perfectly describe their multiplicities under various assumptions. For
instance, one can consider the (anti)nuclei with a vanishing hard-core radius
(as the point-like particles) or with the hard-core radius of proton, but the
fit quality is the same for these assumptions. In this paper we assume the
hard-core radius of nuclei consisting of $A$ baryons or antibaryons to follow
the simple law $R(A) = R_b (A)^\frac{1}{3}$, where $R_b$ is the hard-core
radius of nucleon. To implement such a relation into the hadron resonance gas
model we employ the induced surface tension concept and analyze the hadronic
and (anti)nuclei multiplicities measured by the ALICE collaboration. The hadron
resonance gas model with the induced surface tension allows us to verify
different scenarios of chemical freeze-out of (anti)nuclei. It is shown that
the most successful description of hadrons can be achieved at the chemical
freeze-out temperature $T_h=150$ MeV, while the one for all (anti)nuclei is
$T_A=168.5$ MeV. Possible explanations of this high temperature of (anti)nuclei

distinguish between real and fake imagery. The learned embedding acts as a form
of anomaly detector; namely, an image manipulated from an unseen method will be
detected as fake provided it maps sufficiently far away from the cluster of
real images. Comparing to prior works, FT shows significant improvements in
transferability, which we demonstrate in a series of experiments on

of self-organized patterns, hypothesised to play a role in the formation of
many of the magnificent patterns observed in Nature. In several cases of
interest, the system under scrutiny displays a homogeneous equilibrium, which
is destabilized via a symmetry breaking instability which reflects the
specificity of the problem being inspected. The Turing instability is among the
most celebrated paradigms for pattern formation. In its original form, the
diffusion constants of the two mobile species need to be quite different from
each other for the instability to develop. Unfortunately, this condition limits
the applicability of the theory. To overcome this impediment, and with the
ambitious long term goal to eventually reconcile theory and experiments, we
here propose an alternative mechanism for promoting the onset of patterns. To
this end a multi-species reaction-diffusion system is studied on a discrete,
network-like support: the instability is triggered by the non-normality of the
embedding network. The non-normal character of the dynamics instigates a short
time amplification of the imposed perturbation, thus making the system unstable
for a choice of parameters that would yield stability under the conventional
scenario. Importantly, non-normal networks are pervasively found, as we shall
here briefly review.

It includes and covers both: the geometry of possible walker's positions with

inhomogeneous quantum walks on graphs with vertices of varying degree, the
latter offers us to choose, investigate, and compare quantum walks with
different shift operators. The synthesis of both key ingredients constitutes a
well-suited playground for analyzing percolated quantum walks on a quite
general class of graphs. Analytical treatment of the asymptotic behavior of
percolated quantum walks is presented and worked out in details for the Grover
walk on graphs with maximal degree 3. We find, that for these walks with cyclic
shift operators the existence of an edge-3-coloring of the graph allows for
non-stationary asymptotic behavior of the walk. For different shift operators
the general structure of localized attractors is investigated, which determines
the overall efficiency of a source-to-sink quantum transport across a

two-dimensional periodic arrays of sub-wavelength emitters. This technique only
requires discretizing one period of the array, and thus is computationally

expressed in terms of array's Green's functions. The array Green's functions
are found using the discrete dipole approximation in a periodic manner by
expressing a single point source as a series of periodic arrays of

performance in a large variety of tasks and therefore have been adopted in many
applications. On the other hand, the latest studies revealed that neural
networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples obtained by carefully adding
small perturbation to legitimate samples. Based upon the observation, many
attack methods were proposed. Among them, the optimization-based CW attack is
the most powerful as the produced adversarial samples present much less
distortion compared to other methods. The better attacking effect, however,
comes at the cost of running more iterations and thus longer computation time
to reach desirable results. In this work, we propose to leverage the
information of gradients as a guidance during the search of adversaries. More
specifically, directly incorporating the gradients into the perturbation can be
regarded as a constraint added to the optimization process. We intuitively and
empirically prove the rationality of our method in reducing the search space.
Our experiments show that compared to the original CW attack, the proposed
method requires fewer iterations towards adversarial samples, obtaining a
higher success rate and resulting in smaller $\ell_2$ distortion.

The platform stands out by its ultra-low fluorescence and the ability to
produce various passive structures such as high-Q microresonators and mode-size
converters. By numerical analysis an optimal structure for the efficient
coupling of a dipole emitter to the guided mode could be determined.
Experimentally, the integration of a preselected NV emitter was performed with
an atomic force microscope and the on-chip excitation of the quantum emitter as
well as the coupling of single photons to the guided mode of the integrated
structure could be demonstrated. Our approach shows the potential of this
platform as a robust nanoscale interface of on-chip photonic structures with
solid-state qubits.

In this paper, we contribute to a better understanding of the impact of

consisting in predicting the subject and predicate of a triple given a
question. In order to provide a fair comparison of different architectures, we
evaluate them under the same strategy for inferring the subject, and compare
different architectures for inferring the predicate. The architecture for
inferring the subject is based on a standard LSTM model trained to recognize
the span of the subject in the question and on a linking component that links
the subject span to an entity in the knowledge base. The architectures for
predicate inference are based on i) a standard softmax classifier ranging over
all predicates as output, iii) a model that predicts a low-dimensional encoding
of the property given entity representation and question, iii) a model that
learns to score a pair of subject and predicate given the question as well as
iv) a model based on the well-known FastText model. The comparison of

constant of noble metals following heating with ultrashort pulsed laser beams
and the influence of the temporal variation of the associated optical
properties in the thermomechanical response of the material. The effect of the
electron relaxation time on the optical properties based on the use of a
critical point model is thoroughly explored for various pulse duration values
(i.e. from 110fs to 8ps). The proposed theoretical framework correlates the
dynamical change of optical parameters, relaxation processes and induced
strains-stresses. Simulations are presented by choosing gold as a test material
and we demonstrate that the consideration of the aforementioned factors leads
to significant thermal effect changes compared to results when static
parameters are assumed. The proposed model predicts a substantially smaller
damage threshold and a large increase of the stress which firstly underlines
the significant role of the temporal variation of the optical properties and
secondly enhances its importance with respect to the precise determination of
laser specifications in material micromachining techniques.

reinforcement algorithm, the annealing works instead by increasing gradually
the strength of the on-site energies according to the probability of finding
the walker on each site of the configuration space. Here, by using the
path-integral Monte Carlo simulations of the quantum algorithms, we show that

an approximate wave function using the local expectation values of the system.
We use this algorithm to find solutions to a prototypical constraint
satisfaction problem (XORSAT) close to the satisfiability to unsatisfiability

applications of AI, such as finance, autonomous vehicle control and medicinal

systems to these attacks, systems are still vulnerable to well-crafted attacks.
To address this problem, several adversarial attack detection methods have been
proposed. However, a system can still be vulnerable to adversarial samples that
are designed to specifically evade these detection methods. One recent
detection scheme that has shown good performance is based on uncertainty
estimates derived from Monte-Carlo dropout ensembles. Prior Networks, a new
method of estimating predictive uncertainty, has been shown to outperform
Monte-Carlo dropout on a range of tasks. One of the advantages of this approach
is that the behaviour of a Prior Network can be explicitly tuned to, for
example, predict high uncertainty in regions where there are no training data
samples. In this work, Prior Networks are applied to adversarial attack
detection using measures of uncertainty in a similar fashion to Monte-Carlo
Dropout. Detection based on measures of uncertainty derived from DNNs and
Monte-Carlo dropout ensembles are used as a baseline. Prior Networks are shown
to significantly out-perform these baseline approaches over a range of
adversarial attacks in both detection of whitebox and blackbox configurations.
Even when the adversarial attacks are constructed with full knowledge of the
detection mechanism, it is shown to be highly challenging to successfully
generate an adversarial sample.

-2.013 (J-K_s), valid in the colour range 0.75 < (J-K_s) < 1.3 mag and in the
2MASS system. The observed TRGB is found based on a classical first-order and a
second-order derivative filter applied to the binned luminosity function using
the ""sharpened"" magnitude that takes the colour term into account. Extensive
simulations are carried out to investigate any biases and errors in the derived
distance modulus (DM). Based on these simulations criteria are established
related to the number of stars per bin in the 0.5 magnitude range below the
TRGB and related to the significance with which the peak in the filter response
curve is determined such that the derived distances are unbiased. The DMs based
on the second-order derivative filter are found to be more stable and are
therefore adopted, although this requires twice as many stars per bin. The TRGB
method is applied to specific lines-of-sight where independent distance
estimates exist, based on detached eclipsing binaries in the LMC and SMC,
classical Cepheids in the LMC, RR Lyrae stars in the SMC, and fields in the SMC
where the star formation history (together with reddening and distance) has
been derived from deep VMC data. The analysis shows that the theoretical
calibration is consistent with the data, that the systematic error on the DM is
approximately 0.045 mag, and that random errors of 0.015 mag are achievable.
Reddening is an important element in deriving the distance: we find mean DMs
ranging from 18.92 (for a typical E(B-V) of 0.15 mag) to 19.07 mag (E(B-V)
about 0.04) for the SMC, and ranging from 18.48 (E(B-V) about 0.12 mag) to

human-pose sequences, conditioned on a given starting sequence, we introduce a
random extrinsic factor r, drawn from a predefined prior distribution.
Furthermore, to enforce a direct content loss on the predicted motion sequence
and also to avoid mode-collapse, a novel bidirectional framework is
incorporated by modifying the usual discriminator architecture. The
discriminator is trained also to regress this extrinsic factor r, which is used
alongside with the intrinsic factor (encoded starting pose sequence) to
generate a particular pose sequence. To further regularize the training, we
introduce a novel recursive prediction strategy. In spite of being in a
probabilistic framework, the enhanced discriminator architecture allows
predictions of an intermediate part of pose sequence to be used as a
conditioning for prediction of the latter part of the sequence. The
bidirectional setup also provides a new direction to evaluate the prediction
quality against a given test sequence. For a fair assessment of BiHMP-GAN, we
report performance of the generated motion sequence using (i) a critic model
trained to discriminate between real and fake motion sequence, and (ii) an
action classifier trained on real human motion dynamics. Outcomes of both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations, on the probabilistic generations of

the nonlinear process of optical rectification. The photo-induced spin current
is proportional to the light intensity, and originates from the intrinsic
spin-orbit coupling in TMDs. The spin current spectrum is strongly influenced
by electron-hole interactions, i.e. excitonic effects, analogous to the optical
absorption. Remarkably, excitons change the temperature dependence of the
induced spin current, to the point that the current direction can even be
reversed by varying the temperature. This peculiar excitonic behavior is shown
to emerge from the relative strength of two distinct mechanisms contributing to
the optical response, i.e. a purely interband part and a mixed inter/intraband
contribution. Furthermore, we investigate the valley dichrosim of
second-harmonic charge and spin currents, and demonstrate different valley
polarization of $s$ and $p$ excitons that stem from their distinct angular
momenta. Our findings pave the path to the generation of dc spin currents in
ordinary TMDs without external static electric or magnetic fields.

the QW is over the honeycomb and triangular lattices, and simulates the Dirac

this QW, and show that it is equivalent to introducing spacetime-dependent
local unitaries --- whilst keeping the lattice fixed. By exploiting this
duality between changes in geometry, and changes in local unitaries, we show
that the spacetime-dependent QW simulates the Dirac equation in $(2+1)$ -
dimensional curved spacetime. Interestingly, the duality crucially relies on
the non linear-independence of the three preferred directions of the honeycomb

'98, has been an extremely influential framework for nearest neighbor search in
high-dimensional data sets. While theoretical work has focused on the
approximate nearest neighbor problems, in practice LSH data structures with
suitably chosen parameters are used to solve the exact nearest neighbor problem
(with some error probability). Sublinear query time is often possible in
practice even for exact nearest neighbor search, intuitively because the
nearest neighbor tends to be significantly closer than other data points.
However, theory offers little advice on how to choose LSH parameters outside of
pre-specified worst-case settings.
  We introduce the technique of confirmation sampling for solving the exact
nearest neighbor problem using LSH. First, we give a general reduction that
transforms a sequence of data structures that each find the nearest neighbor
with a small, unknown probability, into a data structure that returns the
nearest neighbor with probability $1-\delta$, using as few queries as possible.
Second, we present a new query algorithm for the LSH Forest data structure with
$L$ trees that is able to return the exact nearest neighbor of a query point
within the same time bound as an LSH Forest of $\Omega(L)$ trees with internal
parameters specifically tuned to the query and data.

of two types: local ones, preserving the mode; and jumps to regions associated

  Energy Harvesting under Power Saving Mode",,,,,"cs.SY eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Internet of things (IoT) comprises of wireless sensors and actuators
connected via access points to the Internet. Often, the sensing devices are
remotely deployed with limited battery power and are equipped with energy
harvesting equipment. These devices transmit real-time data to the base station
(BS), which is used in applications such as anomaly detection. Under sufficient
power availability, wireless transmissions from sensors can be scheduled at
regular time intervals to maintain real-time data acquisition. However, once
the battery is significantly depleted, the devices enter into power saving mode
and need to be more selective in transmitting information to the BS.
Transmitting a particular piece of sensed data consumes power while discarding
it may result in loss of utility at the BS. The goal is to design an optimal
dynamic policy which enables the device to decide whether to transmit or to
discard a piece of sensing data particularly under the power saving mode. This
will enable the sensor to prolong its operation while causing minimum loss of
utility to the application. We develop an analytical framework to capture the
utility of the IoT sensor transmissions and leverage dynamic programming based
approach to derive an optimal real-time transmission policy that is based on
the statistics of information arrival, the likelihood of harvested energy, and
designed lifetime of the sensors. Numerical results show that if the statistics
of future data valuation are accurately predicted, there is a significant
increase in utility obtained at the BS as well as the battery lifetime.

Relation Based Pattern (RBP) extensions to neural network structures that solve

structures for inductive bias into neural networks. Examples of abstract
patterns are the sequence patterns ABA and ABB where A or B can be any object.
These were introduced by Marcus et al (1999) who also found that 7 month old
infants recognise these patterns in sequences that use an unfamiliar vocabulary
while simple recurrent neural networks do not.This result has been contested in
the literature but it is confirmed by our experiments. We also show that the
inability to generalise extends to different, previously untested, settings. We
propose a new approach to modify standard neural network architectures, called
Relation Based Patterns (RBP) with different variants for classification and
prediction. Our experiments show that neural networks with the appropriate RBP
structure achieve perfect classification and prediction performance on
synthetic data, including mixed concrete and abstract patterns. RBP also
improves neural network performance in experiments with real-world sequence
prediction tasks. We discuss these finding in terms of challenges for neural
network models and identify consequences from this result in terms of
developing inductive biases for neural network learning.

difficult for this task due to the low availability of training data: 1)
Circuit simulation is slow, thus generating large-scale dataset is
time-consuming; 2) Most circuit designs are propitiatory IPs within individual
IC companies, making it expensive to collect large-scale datasets. We propose
Learning to Design Circuits (L2DC) to leverage reinforcement learning that

fix the schematic, and optimize the parameters of the transistors automatically
by training an RL agent with no prior knowledge about optimizing circuits.
After iteratively getting observations, generating a new set of transistor
parameters, getting a reward, and adjusting the model, L2DC is able to optimize
circuits. We evaluate L2DC on two transimpedance amplifiers. Trained for a day,
our RL agent can achieve comparable or better performance than human experts
trained for a quarter. It first learns to meet hard-constraints (eg. gain,
bandwidth), and then learns to optimize good-to-have targets (eg. area, power).
Compared with grid search-aided human design, L2DC can achieve
$\mathbf{250}\boldsymbol{\times}$ higher sample efficiency with comparable
performance. Under the same runtime constraint, the performance of L2DC is also

recorded responses which often cannot be directly used for training machine
learning systems. To resolve this issue, a lot of work has been conducted to
control the response quality such that low-quality responses cannot adversely
affect the performance of the machine learning systems. Such work is referred
to as the quality control for crowdsourcing. Past quality control research can
be divided into two major branches: quality control mechanism design and
statistical models. The first branch focuses on designing measures, thresholds,
interfaces and workflows for payment, gamification, question assignment and
other mechanisms that influence workers' behaviour. The second branch focuses
on developing statistical models to perform effective aggregation of responses
to infer correct responses. The two branches are connected as statistical
models (i) provide parameter estimates to support the measure and threshold
calculation, and (ii) encode modelling assumptions used to derive (theoretical)
performance guarantees for the mechanisms. There are surveys regarding each
branch but they lack technical details about the other branch. Our survey is
the first to bridge the two branches by providing technical details on how they
work together under frameworks that systematically unify crowdsourcing aspects

basic skew symmetric property, thus exhibiting passivity. The advantage of
dealing with all these effects together display the following distinct

Lagrangian rigid-robot case; \textit{ii)} the non-linear system is affine in

one of the solvers is a prototype of a new algorithm such as multiwalk (MWA).
When searching for global minima in $\mathbb{R}^p$, the key data structures of
MWA include: $p$ rulers with each ruler assigned $m$ marks and a set of $p$
neighborhood matrices of size up to $m(m-2)$, where each entry represents
absolute values of pairwise differences between $m$ marks. Before taking the
next step, a controller links the tableau of neighborhood matrices and computes
new and improved positions for each of the $m$ marks. The number of columns in
each neighborhood matrix is denoted as the neighborhood radius $r_n \le m-2$.
Any variant of the DEA (differential evolution algorithm) has an effective
population neighborhood of radius not larger than 1. Uncensored
first-passage-time performance experiments that vary the neighborhood radius of
a MW-solver can thus be readily compared to existing variants of DE-solvers.
The paper considers seven test cases of increasing complexity and demonstrates,

variability in convergence rate for seven DE-based solver configurations, and
(2) consistent, monotonic, and significantly faster rate of convergence for the

layer of high-performance servers to close the growing performance gap between
processing units and storage subsystem. SSD-based I/O caching is typically not
effective in workloads with burst accesses in which the caching layer itself
becomes the performance bottleneck because of the large number of accesses.
Existing I/O cache architectures mainly focus on maximizing the cache hit ratio
while they neglect the average queue time of accesses. Previous studies
suggested bypassing the cache when burst accesses are identified. These
schemes, however, are not applicable to a general cache configuration and also
result in significant performance degradation on burst accesses. In this paper,
we propose a novel I/O cache load balancing scheme (LBICA) with adaptive write
policy management to prevent the I/O cache from becoming performance bottleneck
in burst accesses. Our proposal, unlike previous schemes, which disable the I/O
cache or bypass the requests into the disk subsystem in burst accesses,
selectively reduces the number of waiting accesses in the SSD queue and
balances the load between the I/O cache and the disk subsystem while providing
the maximum performance. The proposed scheme characterizes the workload based
on the type of in-queue requests and assigns an effective cache write policy.
We aim to bypass the accesses which 1) are served faster by the disk subsystem
or 2) cannot be merged with other accesses in the I/O cache queue. Doing so,
the selected requests are responded by the disk layer, preventing from
overloading the I/O cache. Our evaluations on a physical system shows that
LBICA reduces the load on the I/O cache by 48% and improves the performance of
burst workloads by 30% compared to the latest state-of-the-art load balancing
scheme.

has become highly developed and astonishingly successful, a consistent
formulation of the associated fracture mechanics that would not conflict with
some observations is still unavailable. It is attempted here. Classical
fracture mechanics, as well as the current commercial softwares, predict
vertical cracks to propagate without branching from the perforations of the
horizontal well casing, which are typically spaced at 10 m or more. However, to
explain the gas production rate at the wellhead, the crack spacing would have
to be only about 0.1 m, which would increase the overall gas permeability of
shale mass about 10,000$\times$. This permeability increase has generally been
attributed to a preexisting system of orthogonal natural cracks, whose spacing
is about 0.1 m. But their average age is about 100 million years, and a recent
analysis indicated that these cracks must have been completely closed by
secondary creep of shale in less than a million years. Here it is considered
that the tectonic events that produced the natural cracks in shale must have
also created weak layers with nano- or micro-cracking damage. It is numerically
demonstrated that a greatly enhanced permeability along the weak layers, with a
greatly increased transverse Biot coefficient, must cause the fracking to
engender lateral branching and the opening of hydraulic cracks along the weak
layers, even if these cracks are initially almost closed. A finite element
crack band model, based on recently developed anisotropic spherocylindrical
microplane constitutive law, demonstrates these findings.

the forward- and the Bragg-diffracted wave functions through a plane, parallel
crystal lamella. It applies for the description of any crystalline medium with
changes of the diffraction properties along the direction of the surface
normal. Experimentally a crystal growth technique has been set up to produce
novel Si1-xGex gradient crystals with 0 < x < 0.4 on a large surface and with
growth rates of up to 0.6 um/min. Layer thicknesses of several 100 um have been
achieved. A tetragonal distortion attributed to different thermal expansion
coefficients has been discovered. The anisotrope mosaic distribution gives
evidences for the existence of misfit dislocations. The reflection curves
calculated by the transfer matrix method fit well the experimental results. The
diffraction data show an intensity increase of 25 related to the experimental
resolution function. Comparing this value with the calculated reflectivity for
perfect silicon, this factor increases to 40.

between the signal and time frequency signal, and it allows to get sense
when/where ceratin frequencies occur in the input signal, this method is
introduced by Dennis Gabor. In this paper, we generalize the classical
Gabor-Fourier transform(GFT) to the Riemannian symmetric space called the
Helgason Gabor Fourier transform (HGFT). We continue with proving several
important properties of HGFT, like the reconstruction formula, the Plancherel
formula, and Parseval formula. Finally we establish some local uncertainty
principle such as Benedicks-type uncertainty principle

electronic systems are of utmost concern especially for safety and
mission-critical systems. Model-based testing and formal verification
techniques can be employed to enhance the reliability of software systems.
Formal models form the basis and are prerequisite for the application of these
techniques. An emerging and promising model learning technique can complement
testing and verification techniques by providing learned models of black box
systems fully automatically. This paper surveys one such state of the art
technique called model learning which recently has attracted much attention of
researchers especially from the domains of testing and verification. This
survey paper reviews and provides comparison summaries highlighting the merits
and shortcomings of learning techniques, algorithms, and tools which form the
basis of model learning. This paper also surveys the successful applications of
model learning technique in multidisciplinary fields making it promising for
testing and verification of realistic systems.
