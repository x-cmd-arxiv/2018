displays spontaneous clustering. Within this model we investigate the
competition between the pinning to a periodic corrugation potential, and a
sideways constant pulling force which would promote a sliding state. For a few
sample particle densities and amplitudes of the periodic corrugation potential
we investigate the depinning from the statically pinned to the dynamically
sliding regime. This sliding state exhibits the competition between a dynamics
where entire clusters are pulled from a minimum to the next and a dynamics
where single colloids or smaller groups leave a cluster and move across the
corrugation energy barrier to join the next cluster downstream in the force
direction. Both kinds of sliding states can occur either coherently across the
entire sample, or asynchronously: the two regimes result in different average
mobilities. Finite temperature tends to destroy separate sliding regimes,
generating a smoother dependence of the mobility on the driving force.

their cross-correlation. Combining these measurements with the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) data and CMB lensing of Planck assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM
model, we constrain the mass bias parameter as $B = 1.54 \pm 0.098\;(1\sigma)$
[$(1-b) = 0.649 \pm 0.041$, where $(1-b) \equiv B^{-1}$], i.e., the Planck
cluster mass should be $35\%$ lower than the true mass. The mass bias
determined by the 2MRS-tSZ cross-power spectrum alone is consistent with that
determined by the tSZ auto-power spectrum alone, suggesting that this large
mass bias is not due to obvious systematics in the tSZ data. We find that the
2MRS-tSZ cross-power spectrum is more sensitive to less massive halos than the
tSZ auto-power spectrum and it significantly improves a constraint on the mass
dependence of the mass bias. The redshift dependence is not strongly
constrained since the multipole range in which high redshift clusters mainly
contribute to the tSZ auto is dominated by the contaminating sources. We
conclude that no strong mass or redshift evolution of the mass bias is needed
to explain the data.

discrete time chains on $\mathbb{Z}_+^d$ with countable action sets. Our
approach is grounded in the approximation of the (controlled) chain's generator
by that of another Markov process. In simple terms, our approach stipulates
applying a second-order Taylor expansion to the value function to replace the
Bellman equation with one in continuous space and time where the transition
matrix is reduced to its first and second moments. In some cases, the resulting
equation (which we label {\bf TCP}) can be interpreted as corresponding to a
Brownian control problem. When tractable, the TCP serves as a useful modeling
tool. More generally, the TCP is a starting point for approximation algorithms.
We develop bounds on the optimality gap---the sub-optimality introduced by
using the control produced by the ""Taylored"" equation. These bounds can be
viewed as a conceptual underpinning, analytical rather than relying on weak
convergence arguments, for the good performance of controls derived from
Brownian control problems. We prove that, under suitable conditions and for
suitably ""large"" initial states, (i) the optimality gap is smaller than a
$1-\alpha$ fraction of the optimal value, where $\alpha\in (0,1)$ is the
discount factor, and (ii) the gap can be further expressed as the infinite
horizon discounted value with a ""lower-order"" per period reward.
Computationally, our framework leads to an ""aggregation"" approach with
performance guarantees. While the guarantees are grounded in PDE theory, the
practical use of this approach requires no knowledge of that theory.

to the identity in the sense that each $\left(h_i-\mathrm{Id}\right)$ is
Lipschitz, and the Lipschitz constant decreases inversely with the number $m$
of functions composed. This implies that $h$ can be represented to any accuracy
by a deep residual network whose nonlinear layers compute functions with a
small Lipschitz constant. Next, we consider nonlinear regression with a
composition of near-identity nonlinear maps. We show that, regarding Fr\'echet
derivatives with respect to the $h_1,...,h_m$, any critical point of a
quadratic criterion in this near-identity region must be a global minimizer. In
contrast, if we consider derivatives with respect to parameters of a fixed-size
residual network with sigmoid activation functions, we show that there are
near-identity critical points that are suboptimal, even in the realizable case.
Informally, this means that functional gradient methods for residual networks
cannot get stuck at suboptimal critical points corresponding to near-identity
layers, whereas parametric gradient methods for sigmoidal residual networks
suffer from suboptimal critical points in the near-identity region.

handling rare and unseen cases. In this paper, we address the problem by
incorporating dictionaries into deep neural networks for the Chinese CNER task.
Two different architectures that extend the Bi-directional Long Short-Term

While past work on web content detection has relied on syntactic parsing or on
emulation of HTML and Javascript to extract features, our approach operates
directly on a language-agnostic stream of tokens extracted directly from static
HTML files with a simple regular expression. This makes it fast enough to
operate in high-frequency data contexts like firewalls and web proxies, and
allows it to avoid the attack surface exposure of complex parsing and emulation
code. Unlike well-known approaches such as bag-of-words models, which ignore
spatial information, our neural network examines content at hierarchical
spatial scales, allowing our model to capture locality and yielding superior
accuracy compared to bag-of-words baselines. Our proposed architecture achieves
a 97.5% detection rate at a 0.1% false positive rate, and classifies
small-batched web pages at a rate of over 100 per second on commodity hardware.

concept of positional variance profiles, such trajectories are shown to be
decomposable into two phases: In a first phase, the variance of the limb
position over many trajectories increases rapidly; in a second phase, it then
decreases steadily. A new theoretical model, where the aiming task is seen as a
Shannon-like communication problem, is developed to describe the second phase:
Information is transmitted from a source (determined by the position at the end
of the first phase), to a destination (the movement's end-point) over a channel
perturbed by Gaussian noise, with the presence of a noiseless feedback link.
Information-theoretic considerations show that the positional variance
decreases exponentially with a rate equal to the channel capacity C. Two
existing datasets for simple pointing tasks are re-analyzed and observations on
real data confirm our model. The first phase has constant duration and C is
found constant across instructions and task parameters, which thus
characterizes the participant's performance. Our model provides a clear
understanding of the speed-accuracy tradeoff in aimed movements: Since the
participant's capacity is fixed, a higher prescribed accuracy necessarily
requires a longer second phase resulting in an increased overall movement time.
The well-known Fitts' law is also recovered using this approach.

correct-by-construction systems that interact with an unknown or adversarial
environment. We study how to do reactive synthesis when part of the
specification of the system is that its behavior should be random. Randomness
can be useful, for example, in a network protocol fuzz tester whose output
should be varied, or a planner for a surveillance robot whose route should be
unpredictable. However, existing reactive synthesis techniques do not provide a
way to ensure random behavior while maintaining functional correctness. Towards
this end, we generalize the recently-proposed framework of control
improvisation (CI) to add reactivity. The resulting framework of reactive
control improvisation provides a natural way to integrate a randomness
requirement with the usual functional specifications of reactive synthesis over
a finite window. We theoretically characterize when such problems are
realizable, and give a general method for solving them. For specifications
given by reachability or safety games or by deterministic finite automata, our
method yields a polynomial-time synthesis algorithm. For various other types of
specifications including temporal logic formulas, we obtain a polynomial-space
algorithm and prove matching PSPACE-hardness results. We show that all of these
randomized variants of reactive synthesis are no harder in a
complexity-theoretic sense than their non-randomized counterparts.

fractional hedonic game, that is a coalition formation game in which agents'
utilities are such that the total benefit of agent $i$ belonging to a coalition
(given by the sum of $w_{i,j}$ over all other agents $j$ belonging to the same

excluding herself. Modified fractional hedonic games constitute a class of
succinctly representable hedonic games.
  We are interested in the scenario in which agents, individually or jointly,
choose to form a new coalition or to join an existing one, until a stable
outcome is reached. To this aim, we consider common stability notions, leading
to strong Nash stable outcomes, Nash stable outcomes or core stable outcomes:
we study their existence, complexity and performance, both in the case of
general weights and in the case of 0-1 weights. In particular, we completely
characterize the existence of the considered stable outcomes and show many
tight or asymptotically tight results on the performance of these natural
stable outcomes for modified fractional hedonic games, also highlighting the
differences with respect to the model of fractional hedonic games, in which the
total benefit of an agent in a coalition is averaged over all members of that

hardware limitations, one can only expect to acquire images of high resolution
in either the spatial or spectral domains. This paper focuses on hyperspectral
image super-resolution (HSI-SR), where a hyperspectral image (HSI) with low
spatial resolution (LR) but high spectral resolution is fused with a
multispectral image (MSI) with high spatial resolution (HR) but low spectral
resolution to obtain HR HSI. Existing deep learning-based solutions are all
supervised that would need a large training set and the availability of HR HSI,
which is unrealistic. Here, we make the first attempt to solving the HSI-SR
problem using an unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture that carries the
following uniquenesses. First, it is composed of two encoder-decoder networks,
coupled through a shared decoder, in order to preserve the rich spectral
information from the HSI network. Second, the network encourages the
representations from both modalities to follow a sparse Dirichlet distribution
which naturally incorporates the two physical constraints of HSI and MSI.
Third, the angular difference between representations are minimized in order to
reduce the spectral distortion. We refer to the proposed architecture as
unsupervised Sparse Dirichlet-Net, or uSDN. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the superior performance of uSDN as compared to the
state-of-the-art.

limited to Cartesian coordinates in flat spacetime due to the incorrect
transformation rules used to define them. Here the correct transformation rules
are derived, which are particularly unusual as they involve second derivatives
of the coordinate transformation and an integral. Transformations involving
integrals have not been seen before. This is significantly different from the
familiar transformation rules for a dipole, where the components transform as
tensors. It enables quadrupoles to be correctly defined in general relativity
and to prescribe the equations of motion for a quadrupole in a coordinate
system adapted to its motion and then transform them to the laboratory
coordinates. An example is given of another unusual feature: a quadrupole which
is free of dipole terms in polar coordinates has dipole terms in Cartesian
coordinates. It is shown that dipoles, electric dipoles, quadrupoles and
electric quadrupoles can be defined without reference to a metric and in a
coordinates free manner. This is particularly useful given their complicated
coordinate transformation.

Sommerfeld enhancement. Since details of the underlying DM phase-space
distribution function become critical, there are potentially large
uncertainties in the final result. We provide here a first attempt towards a
comprehensive investigation of these systematics, addressing the impact on the
expected DM flux from Milky Way dwarfs via Bayesian inference on the available
stellar kinematic datasets. After reconsidering the study case of ergodic
systems, we investigate for the first time scenarios where DM particle orbits
may have a radial or tangential bias. We consider both cuspy and cored
parametric DM density profiles, together with the case of a non-parametric halo
modelling directly connected to line-of-sight observable quantities. The main
findings of our work highlight the relevance of the assumed phase-space

convolution of the spatial part in case of velocity-dependent annihilation
rate, an enhancement (suppression) with respect to the limit of isotropic
phase-space distributions is obtained for the case of tangentially (radially)
biased DM particle orbits. We provide new estimates for J-factors for the eight
brightest Milky Way dwarfs also in the limit of velocity-independent DM
annihilation, in good agreement with previous results in literature, and derive
data-driven lower-bounds based on the non-parametric modelling of the halo

investigation of these downflows using a large sample which was missing
earlier. The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) has provided a wealth
of observational data of sunspots at high spatial and spectral resolution in
the past few years. We have identified sixty datasets obtained with IRIS raster

supersonic downflows in the Si IV 1403 {\AA} line. These downflows mostly
appear in the penumbral regions, though some of them are found in the umbrae.
We also found that almost half of these downflows show signatures in
chromospheric lines. Furthermore, a detailed spectral analysis was performed by
selecting a small spectral window containing the O IV 1400/1401 {\AA} and Si IV
1403 {\AA} lines. Six Gaussian functions were simultaneously fitted to these
three spectral lines and their satellite lines associated with the supersonic
downflows. We calculated the intensity, Doppler velocity and line width for
these lines. Using the O IV 1400/1401 {\AA} line ratio, we find that the
downflow components are around one order of magnitude less dense than the
regular components. Results from our statistical analysis suggest that these

users in proximity may not always be under the same group. Therefore, we use
acoustic context extracted from audio signals to infer interaction pattern
among the subjects in proximity. We have developed an unsupervised and
lightweight mechanism for user group detection by taking cues from network
science and measuring the cohesivity of the detected groups in terms of
modularity. Taking modularity into consideration, MeetSense can efficiently
eliminate incorrect groups, as well as adapt the mechanism depending on the
role played by the proximity and the acoustic context in a specific scenario.
The proposed method has been implemented and tested under many real-life
scenarios in an academic institute environment, and we observe that MeetSense
can identify user groups with close to 90% accuracy even in a noisy

services with vastly heterogeneous requirements: enhanced mobile broadband
(eMBB), massive machine-type communications (mMTC), and ultra-reliable
low-latency communications (URLLC). Service heterogeneity can be accommodated
by network slicing, through which each service is allocated resources to
provide performance guarantees and isolation from the other services. Slicing
of the Radio Access Network (RAN) is typically done by means of orthogonal
resource allocation among the services. This work studies the potential
advantages of allowing for non-orthogonal sharing of RAN resources in uplink
communications from a set of eMBB, mMTC and URLLC devices to a common base
station. The approach is referred to as Heterogeneous Non-Orthogonal Multiple
Access (H-NOMA), in contrast to the conventional NOMA techniques that involve
users with homogeneous requirements and hence can be investigated through a
standard multiple access channel. The study devises a communication-theoretic
model that accounts for the heterogeneous requirements and characteristics of
the three services. The concept of reliability diversity is introduced as a
design principle that leverages the different reliability requirements across
the services in order to ensure performance guarantees with non-orthogonal RAN
slicing. This study reveals that H-NOMA can lead, in some regimes, to
significant gains in terms of performance trade-offs among the three generic
services as compared to orthogonal slicing.

and Svore in 2016, rapid developments has been made on quantum optimization
algorithms. Recently Brand\~ao et al. improved the quantum SDP-solver in the
so-called quantum state input model, where the input matrices of the SDP are
given as purified mixed states. They also gave the first non-trivial
application of quantum SDP-solving by obtaining a more efficient algorithm for
the problem of shadow tomography (proposed by Aaronson in 2017). In this paper
we improve on all previous quantum SDP-solvers. Mainly we construct better
Gibbs-samplers for both input models, which directly gives better bounds for
SDP-solving. For an SDP with $m$ constraints involving $n\times n$ matrices,
our improvements yield an $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\left( \left( \sqrt{m} +
\sqrt{n}\gamma \right)s \gamma^4\right)$ upper bound on SDP-solving in the
sparse matrix input model and an $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\left(
\left(\sqrt{m}+B^{2.5}\gamma^{3.5} \right)B\gamma^4 \right)$ upper bound in the
quantum state input model. We then apply these results to the problem of shadow
tomography to simultaneously improve the best known upper bounds on sample
complexity due to Aaronson and complexity due Brandao et al. Furthermore, we
apply our quantum SDP-solvers to the problems of quantum state discrimination
and E-optimal design. In both cases we beat the classical lower bound in terms
of some parameters, at the expense of heavy dependence on some other
parameters. Finally we prove two lowers bounds for solving SDPs using quantum
algorithms: (1) $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{m}B/\eps)$ in the quantum state input
model, and (2) $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{m}\alpha/\eps)$ in the quantum operator
input model. These lower bounds show that the $\sqrt{m}$ factor and the
polynomial dependence on the parameters $B,\alpha$, and $1/\eps$ are necessary.

(SNR) achievable for ground-based, adaptive-optics assisted exoplanet imaging
by applying sophisticated post-processing algorithms. In particular, we
investigate the benefits of including time domain information. Methods. We
introduce a new speckle-suppression technique in data post-processing based on
wavelet transformation. This technique explicitly considers the time domain in
a given data set (specifically the frequencies of speckle variations and their
time dependence) and allows us to filter-out speckle noise. We combine our
wavelet-based algorithm with state-of-the-art principal component analysis
(PCA) based PSF subtraction routines and apply it to archival data sets of
known directly imaged exoplanets. The data sets were obtained in the L filter
where the short integration times allow for a sufficiently high temporal
sampling of the speckle variations. Results. We demonstrate that improvements
in the peak SNR of up to forty to sixty percent can be achieved. We also show
that, when combined with wavelet-denoising, the PCA PSF model requires
systematically smaller numbers of components for the fit to achieve the highest
SNR. The improvement potential is, however, data set dependent or, more
specifically, closely linked to the field rotation available in a given data
set: larger amounts of rotation allow for a better suppression of the speckle
noise. Conclusions. We have demonstrated that by applying advanced data
post-processing techniques, the contrast performance in archival high-contrast
imaging data sets can be improved.

Comments welcome",,"10.3847/1538-3881/ab0e0a",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over a hundred rocky planets orbiting Sun-like stars in very short orbital
periods (<1 day) have been discovered by the Kepler mission. These planets,
known as ultra-short-period (USP) planets, are unlikely to have attained their
orbits in situ. Instead, they must have migrated in. Here we propose that these
planets reach their current orbits by high-eccentricity migration. In a
scaled-down version of the dynamics that may have been experienced by their
high mass analog, the hot Jupiters, these planets reach high eccentricities via
chaotic secular interactions with their companion planets and then undergo
orbital circularization due to dissipation of tides raised on the planet. This
proposal is motivated by the following observations: planetary systems observed
by Kepler often contain several super-Earths with non-negligible eccentricities
and inclinations, and possibly extending beyond AU distances; while only a
small fraction of USP planets have known transiting companions, and none
closely spaced, we argue that most of them should have companions at periods of
~10-50 days. The outer sibling planets, through secular chaos, can remove
angular momentum from the inner most planet, originally at periods of ~5-10
days. When the latter reaches an eccentricity higher than 0.8, it is tidally
captured by the central star and becomes an USP planet. This scenario naturally
explains the observation that most USP planets have significantly more distant
transiting companions compared to their counterparts at slightly longer periods
(1-3 days), a feature un-accounted for in other proposed scenarios. Our model
also predicts that USP planets should have: (i) spin-orbit angles, and
inclinations relative to outer planets, in the range of ~10-50 degrees; (ii)
several outer planetary companions extending to beyond AU distances, both of
which may be tested by TESS and its follow-up observations.

In total, 152 X-ray sources are detected. Combined with Spitzer and 2MASS
photometry, 66 X-ray sources are reliably matched to an IR counterpart. We
identify 21 class I, 6 flat spectrum, 16 class II, and 18 class III young
stars; 5 were unclassified. Eighteen sources were variable in X-rays, 8
exhibiting flare-like emission, and one periodic source. The cluster X-ray
luminosity distance was estimated, the best match was to the nearer distance of
260pc for the front of the Aquila Rift complex. The $N_{H}$ vs. $A_{K}$ ratio
is found to be $\sim$0.68x10$^{22}$, similar to that measured in other young
low mass regions, but lower than that measured in the ISM and high mass
clusters ($\sim$1.6-2x10$^{22}$). We find the spatial distribution closely
follows that of the dense filament from which the stars have formed, with the
class II population still strongly associated with the filament. There are four
sub-clusters in the field, with three forming knots in the filament, and a
fourth to the west, which may not be associated but may be contributing to the
distributed class III population. A high percentage of diskless class IIIs
(upper limit 30% of classified X-ray sources) in such a young cluster could
indicate that processing of disks is influenced by the cluster environment and
is not solely time-scale dependent.

the mass scaled with the critical density of the universe and the X-ray
temperature of galaxy clusters is approximately represented by $M_\Delta
\propto T_X^{3/2}$ (e.g. $\Delta=500$). This relation is often interpreted as
evidence that clusters are in virial equilibrium. However, the recently
discovered fundamental plane (FP) of clusters indicates that the temperature of
clusters primarily depends on a combination of the characteristic mass $M_s$
and radius $r_s$ of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile rather than $M_\Delta$.
Moreover, the angle of the FP revealed that clusters are not in virial
equilibrium because of continuous mass accretion from the surrounding matter.
By considering both the FP and the mass dependence of the cluster concentration
parameter, we show that this paradox can be solved and the relation $M_\Delta
\propto T_X^{3/2}$ actually reflects the central structure of clusters. We also
find that the intrinsic scatter in the halo concentration-mass relation can
largely account for the spread of clusters on the FP. We also show that X-ray
data alone form the FP and the angle and the position are consistent with those
of the FP constructed from gravitational lensing data. We demonstrate that a
possible shift between the two FPs can be used to calibrate cluster masses
obtained via X-ray observations.

the Langmuir waves, even when they are separated by strongly inhomogeneous

that if the background density is continuously varying, the growth rate of the
instability is lower; though in all cases, the system remains within the linear
regime longer and the instability is not extinguished. In all cases, the beam
loses approximately the same fraction of its initial kinetic energy in

previous observations. The stacking analyses of previous Chandra observations
suggested that these seven objects likely contain some candidates for
intrinsically X-ray weak BAL quasars. With the new Chandra observations, six

hard-band flux weakness, and find that two objects, LBQS $1203+1530$ and LBQS

HiBAL quasars are good candidates for intrinsically X-ray weak BAL quasars. The
mid-infrared-to-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the two candidates
are consistent with those of typical quasars. We constrain the fraction of
intrinsically X-ray weak AGNs among HiBAL quasars to be $\approx 7-10\%$

Absorption, SED slope, and AgeJX are age indicators. SFiNCs clusters are
examined individually, and collectively with MYStIX clusters, to give the
following results. (1) SFiNCs is dominated by smaller, younger, and more
heavily obscured clusters than MYStIX. (2) SFiNCs cloud-associated clusters
have the high ellipticities aligned with their host molecular filaments
indicating morphology inherited from their parental clouds. (3) The effect of
cluster expansion is evident from the radius-age, radius-absorption, and
radius-SED correlations. Core radii increase dramatically from ~0.08 to ~0.9 pc

combining the empirical AgeJX method with PMS evolutionary models, which treat
dynamo-generated magnetic fields in different ways. Leveraging X-ray data to
identify disk-free objects, we impose similar stellar mass sensitivity limits
for disk-bearing and disk-free YSOs while extending the analysis to stellar
masses as low as M~0.1 Mo. We find that the disk longevity estimates are
strongly affected by the choice of PMS evolutionary model. Assuming a disk
fraction of 100% at zero age, the inferred disk half-life changes
significantly, from t1/2 ~ 1.3--2 Myr to t1/2 ~ 3.5 Myr when switching from
non-magnetic to magnetic PMS models. In addition, we find no statistically

different from the population where data are sampled from. For instance, when
the goal is to introduce a new treatment to a target population, the question
is what efficacy (or effectiveness) can be gained by switching patients from a
standard of care (control) to this new treatment, for which the average
treatment effect for the control (ATC) estimand can be applied. In this paper,
we propose two estimators based on augmented inverse probability weighting to
estimate the WATE for a well defined target population (i.e., there exists a
target function that describes the population of interest), using observational

differential rotation, local turbulence and magnetic fields. It has been
previously shown that the solar shape exhibits asphericity that evolves with
the 11-year cycle. Thanks to the capability of the SoHO/MDI and SDO/HMI
instruments to observe with an unprecedented accuracy the surface gravity
oscillation (f) modes, it is possible to extract information concerning the
coefficients of rotational frequency splitting, a1, a3 and a5, that measure the
differential rotation, together with the a2, a4 and a6 asphericity
coefficients. Analysis of these helioseismology data for almost two solar
cycles, from 1996 to 2017, reveals a close correlation of the a1 and a5
coefficients with the solar activity, whilst a3 exhibits a long-term trend and
a weak correlation in the current cycle indicating a substantial change of the
global rotation, potentially associated with a long-term evolution of the solar
cycles. Looking in more details, the asphericity coefficients, a2, a4 and a6
are more strongly associated with the solar cycle when applying a time lag of
respectively 0.1, 1.6 and -1.6 years. The magnitude of a6-coefficient varies in
phase with the sunspot number (SN), but its amplitude is ahead of the SN
variation. The last measurements made in mid 2017 indicate that the magnitude
of a6-coefficient has probably reached its minimum; therefore, the next solar
minimum can be expected by the end of 2018 or in the beginning of 2019. The
so-called seismic radius in the range of f-mode angular degree: l=137-299
exhibits a temporal variability in anti-phase with the solar activity; its
relative value decreased by 2.3E-05 in Solar Cycle 23 and 1.7E-05 in Cycle 24.
Such results will be useful for better understanding the physical mechanisms

revealed negligible correlation between the observed and modeled data for the
proctored plus out-of-class scores, while a strong correlation is observed for
the proctored scores. Using the proctored grade distribution as a reference, we
performed goodness-of-fit tests using the Bayesian probability fit and the
original reference proportions. Using the expected counts from the two
different methods, we found p-values of 0.023 and 0.008. Both p-values support
the hypothesis that there is significant difference in proctored plus

showed that approximately 25% of all grades are shifted towards higher grades.
Our studies clearly show that grade inflation induced by out-of-class

comparing the degree of inflation in our grade distribution with the national

hydrodynamic problems. Even when unstable, these states provide the
bifurcation-theoretic explanation for the origin of the observed states. In
turbulent wall-bounded shear flows, these states have been hypothesized to be
saddle points organizing the trajectories within a chaotic attractor. These
states must be computed with Newton's method or one of its generalizations,
since time-integration cannot converge to unstable equilibria. The bottleneck
is the solution of linear systems involving the Jacobian of the Navier-Stokes

constructing and directly inverting the Jacobian, but this is unfeasible for
the matrices arising from three-dimensional hydrodynamic configurations in
large domains. A popular method is to seek states that are invariant under
numerical time integration. Surprisingly, equilibria may also be found by
seeking flows that are invariant under a single very large Backwards-Euler
Forwards-Euler timestep. We show that this method, called Stokes
preconditioning, is 10 to 50 times faster at computing steady states in plane
Couette flow and traveling waves in pipe flow. Moreover, it can be carried out
using Channelflow (by Gibson) and Openpipeflow (by Willis) without any changes

of the integration period and Reynolds number by computing the full spectra of
the operators corresponding to the Jacobians of both methods.

compressibility and probes the thermodynamic equation of state. In 2D, a
dynamical scaling symmetry for atoms interacting via a {\delta}-potential
predicts the breathing mode to occur at exactly twice the harmonic confinement
frequency. However, a renormalized quantum treatment introduces a new length
scale which breaks this classical scale invariance resulting in a so-called

quantifier-free formula F(X1,X2,...,Xn), involving equalities and inequalities
of real polynomials with real variables. The complete problems for this
complexity class are called Existential Theory of the Reals Complete.
  In this paper we show that recognizing visibility graphs of polygons with
holes is Existential Theory of the Reals Complete. Moreover, we show that
recognizing visibility graphs of simple polygons when we have the internal and
external visibility graphs, is also Existential Theory of the Reals Complete.

massive cyber-physical system that depends on advanced two-way communication
infrastructure to integrate a myriad of different smart devices. While the
introduction of the cyber component has made the grid much more flexible and
efficient with so many smart devices, it also broadened the attack surface of
the power grid. Particularly, compromised devices pose a great danger to the
healthy operations of the smart-grid. For instance, the attackers can control
the devices to change the behaviour of the grid and can impact the
measurements. In this paper, to detect such misbehaving malicious smart grid
devices, we propose a machine learning and convolution-based classification
framework. Our framework specifically utilizes system and library call lists at
the kernel level of the operating system on both resource-limited and
resource-rich smart grid devices such as RTUs, PLCs, PMUs, and IEDs. Focusing
on the types and other valuable features extracted from the system calls, the
framework can successfully identify malicious smart-grid devices. In order to
test the efficacy of the proposed framework, we built a representative testbed
conforming to the IEC-61850 protocol suite and evaluated its performance with
different system calls. The proposed framework in different evaluation
scenarios yields very high accuracy (avg. 91%) which reveals that the framework
is effective to overcome compromised smart grid devices problem.

diverse, with magmatic processes across a wide range of compositions,
temperatures, activity rates, volcanic eruption styles, and background
gravitational force magnitudes. Worlds in all these classes are likely to be
the most characterizable rocky exoplanets in the near future due to
observational advantages that stem from their preferential occurrence in short
orbital periods and their bright day-side flux in the infrared. Transit
techniques should enable a level of characterization of these worlds analogous
to hot Jupiters. Understanding processes on highly volcanic worlds is critical
to interpret imminent observations. The physical states of these worlds are
likely to inform not just geodynamic processes, but also planet formation, and
phenomena crucial to habitability. Volcanic and magmatic activity uniquely
allows chemical investigation of otherwise spectroscopically inaccessible
interior compositions. These worlds will be vital to assess the degree to which
planetary interior element abundances compare to their stellar hosts, and may
also offer pathways to study both the very young Earth, and the very early form

geometric design and analysis of partial differential equations defined on
surfaces. They are already a standard in high-end computer animation and
graphics and are becoming available in a number of geometric modelling systems
for engineering design. The subdivision refinement rules are usually adapted
from knot insertion rules for splines. The quadrilateral Catmull-Clark scheme
considered in this work is equivalent to cubic B-splines away from
extraordinary, or irregular, vertices with other than four adjacent elements.
Around extraordinary vertices the surface consists of a nested sequence of
smooth spline patches which join $C^1$ continuously at the point itself. As
known from geometric design literature, the subdivision weights can be
optimised so that the surface quality is improved by minimising
short-wavelength surface oscillations around extraordinary vertices. We use the
related techniques to determine weights that minimise finite element
discretisation errors as measured in the thin-shell energy norm. The
optimisation problem is formulated over a characteristic domain and the errors
in approximating cup- and saddle-like quadratic shapes obtained from
eigenanalysis of the subdivision matrix are minimised. In finite element
analysis the optimised subdivision weights for either cup- or saddle-like
shapes are chosen depending on the shape of the solution field around an
extraordinary vertex. As our computations confirm, the optimised subdivision
weights yield a reduction of $50\%$ and more in discretisation errors in the
energy and $L_2$ norms. Although, as to be expected, the convergence rates are
the same as for the classical Catmull-Clark weights, the convergence constants
are improved.

which is often degenerate and reduces to a Hamiltonian form on its symplectic
leaves, is solved by using a symplectic method (e.g., Verlet) with degenerate

construct a modified friction matrix associated with the irreversible part in
such a way that a modified degeneracy condition is satisfied. The modified
irreversible dynamics can be further solved by an explicit midpoint method if
not exactly solvable. Our findings are verified by various numerical

light temporally, or using intensity modulated waveforms and matched filters to
remove the scattered light spectrally. In this paper, a new method is proposed
which primarily uses the backscattering asymmetry property for object detection
and geometric profiling. In our approach, two parallel and identical continuous
wave (CW) laser beams with narrow beam widths (~2mm) are used as active
illumination sources. The two beams also have controllable spacing and aiming
angle, as well as initial phase difference for convenience of scanning and
profiling a target. Through theory and experimental results, it will be shown
that when an object leans or tilts towards one of the beam's central
trajectory, the asymmetry in the backscattered signals can be used to indicate
the location or slope of the target's surface, respectively. By varying the
spacing or aiming angle of the two beams, a number of surface samples can be
collected to reconstruct the object's shape geometrically. The resolution and
range limit of our approach are also measured and reported in this work. In
application, our proposed method provides an economic solution to perform

implementations have often been characterized by unpredicted phenomena that are
sometimes detrimental to system performance. The development of traffic models
that can capture these sorts of behaviors is a key step for helping managed

an approach for solving for driver behavior of entering and exiting managed

method is inspired by recent work in extending a dynamic-system-based modeling
framework from traffic behaviors on individual roads, to models at junctions,
and can be considered a further extension of this dynamic-system paradigm to
the route/lane choice problem. Unlike traditional route choice models that are
often based on discrete-choice methods and often rely on computing and
comparing drivers' estimated travel times from taking different routes, our
method is agnostic to the particular choice of physical traffic model and is
suited specifically towards making decisions at these interfaces using only
local information. These features make it a natural drop-in component to extend

where we find that multiple co-spatial spectral components are required. In
particular, the ALMA data reveal that the radio spectrum of all four knots in
the jet turns over at approximately 100 GHz, which requires a second component
for the bright optical/UV emission. Further, the optical/UV has a soft spectrum
and is inconsistent with the relatively flat X-ray spectrum, which indicates a
third component at higher energies. Using archival VLA imaging, we have
measured the proper motion of the innermost knots at 0.9+/-0.6 and 1.1+/-0.4 c,
which when combined with the low jet-to-counterjet flux ratio yields an
orientation angle for the system of 74 (+9,-18) degrees. In the radio, we find
high fractional polarization of the inner jet of up to 30% while in the optical
no polarization is detected (< 8%). We investigate different scenarios for
explaining the particular multi-component SED of the knots. Inverse Compton
models are ruled out due to the extreme departure from equipartition and the
unrealistically high total jet power required. The multi-component SED can be
naturally explained within a leptohadronic scenario, but at the cost of very
high power in relativistic protons. A two-component synchrotron model remains a

  Unpredicted Load Demands","8 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper a nonlinear control design for power balancing in networked
microgrids using energy storage devices is presented. Each microgrid is
considered to be interfaced to the distribution feeder though a solid-state
transformer (SST). The internal duty cycle based controllers of each SST
ensures stable regulation of power commands during normal operation. But
problem arises when a sudden change in load or generation occurs in any
microgrid in a completely unpredicted way in between the time instants at which
the SSTs receive their power setpoints. In such a case, the energy storage unit
in that microgrid must produce or absorb the deficit power. The challenge lies
in designing a suitable regulator for this purpose owing to the nonlinearity of
the battery model and its coupling with the nonlinear SST dynamics. We design
an input-output linearization based controller, and show that it guarantees
closed-loop stability via a cascade connection with the SST model. The design
is also extended to the case when multiple SSTs must coordinate their
individual storage controllers to assist a given SST whose storage capacity is
insufficient to serve the unpredicted load. The design is verified using the
IEEE 34-bus distribution system with nine SST-driven microgrids.

reformulated as second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation with maximal
clique- and cycle-based SDP feasibility constraints. The formulation is based
on the positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix completion theorem, which states
that if all sub-matrices corresponding to maximal cliques in a chordal graph
are PSD, then the partial matrix related to the chordal graph can be completed
as a full PSD matrix. Existing methods in [1] first construct a chordal graph
through Cholesky factorization. In this paper, we identify maximal cliques and
minimal chordless cycles first. Enforcing the submatrices related to the
maximal cliques and cycles PSD will guarantee a PSD full matrix. Further, we
conduct chordal relaxation for the minimal chordless cycles by adding virtual
lines and decompose each chordless cycle to 3-node cycles. Thus, the entire
graph consists of trees, maximal cliques, and 3-node cycles. The submatrices
related to the maximal cliques and 3-node cycles are enforced to be PSD to
achieve a full PSD matrix. As majority power grids having the size of maximal
cliques limited to 4-node, this graph decomposition method results in a
low-rank full PSD matrix. The proposed method significantly reduces computing
time for SDP relaxation of AC OPF and can handle power systems with thousands
of buses.

individual spends most of the time while carrying out its usual activities
(eating, resting, reproduction, ...). Although a well-established definition of
this concept is lacking, there is a variety of home range estimators. The first
objective of this work is to review and categorize the statistical
methodologies proposed in the literature to approximate the home range of an
animal, based on a sample of observed locations. The second aim is to address
the open question of choosing the ""best"" home range from a collection of them
based on the same sample. We introduce a numerical index, based on a
penalization criterion, to rank the estimated home ranges. The key idea is to
balance the excess area covered by the estimator (with respect to the original
sample) and a shape descriptor measuring the over-adjustment of the home range
to the data. To our knowledge, apart from computing the home range area, our
ranking procedure is the first one which is both applicable to real data and to
any type of home range estimator. Further, the optimization of the selection
index provides in fact a way to select the smoothing parameter for the kernel
home range estimator. For clarity of exposition, we have applied all the
estimation procedures and our selection proposal to a set of real locations of
a Mongolian wolf using R as the statistical software. As a byproduct, this
review contains a thorough revision of the implementation of home range
estimators in the R language.

Second, least squares error (LSE)-based semidefinite programming (SDP) cutting

Numerical results for the proposed algorithm demonstrate simultaneous state

limitations. In this work we use a recently developed computational tool based
on the USPEX structure prediction code to perform an evolutionary grand
canonical search of GB structure at 0 K. For high-angle [100] tilt boundaries
the ground states generated by the evolutionary algorithm agree with the
predictions of the {\gamma}-surface method. For the [110] tilt boundaries, the
search predicts novel high-density low-energy grain boundary structures and
multiple grain boundary phases within the entire misorientation range.
Molecular dynamics simulation demonstrate that the new structures are more
stable at high temperature. We observe first-order grain boundary phase
transitions and investigate how the structural multiplicity affects the
mechanisms of the point defect absorption. Specifically, we demonstrate a
two-step nucleation process, when initially the point defects are absorbed
through a formation of a metastable GB structure with higher density, followed
by a transformation of this structure into a GB interstitial loop or a

  We present Ekiden, a system that addresses these critical gaps by combining
blockchains with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Ekiden leverages a
novel architecture that separates consensus from execution, enabling efficient
TEE-backed confidentiality-preserving smart-contracts and high scalability. Our
prototype (with Tendermint as the consensus layer) achieves example performance
of 600x more throughput and 400x less latency at 1000x less cost than the
Ethereum mainnet.
  Another contribution of this paper is that we systematically identify and
treat the pitfalls arising from harmonizing TEEs and blockchains. Treated
separately, both TEEs and blockchains provide powerful guarantees, but
hybridized, though, they engender new attacks. For example, in naive designs,
privacy in TEE-backed contracts can be jeopardized by forgery of blocks, a
seemingly unrelated attack vector. We believe the insights learned from Ekiden
will prove to be of broad importance in hybridized TEE-blockchain systems.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1802.06527",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Salient object detection (SOD), which aims to find the most important region
of interest and segment the relevant object/item in that area, is an important
yet challenging vision task. This problem is inspired by the fact that human
seems to perceive main scene elements with high priorities. Thus, accurate
detection of salient objects in complex scenes is critical for human-computer
interaction. In this paper, we present a novel feature learning framework for
SOD, in which we cast the SOD as a pixel-wise classification problem. The
proposed framework utilizes a densely hierarchical feature fusion network,
named HyperFusion-Net, automatically predicts the most important area and
segments the associated objects in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, inspired
by the human perception system and image reflection separation, we first
decompose input images into reflective image pairs by content-preserving
transforms. Then, the complementary information of reflective image pairs is
jointly extracted by an interweaved convolutional neural network (ICNN) and
hierarchically combined with a hyper-dense fusion mechanism. Based on the fused
multi-scale features, our method finally achieves a promising way of predicting
SOD. As shown in our extensive experiments, the proposed method consistently
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on seven public datasets with a
large margin.

increasingly aware that decisions should be personalized to each patient,

to those who will be harmed by it. Individual-level treatment effects can be
estimated with tools adapted from machine learning, but different models can
yield contradictory estimates. Unlike risk prediction models, however,
treatment effect models cannot be easily evaluated against each other using a
held-out test set because the true treatment effect itself is never directly
observed. Besides outcome prediction accuracy, several metrics that can
leverage held-out data to evaluate treatment effects models have been proposed,
but they are not widely used. We provide a didactic framework that elucidates
the relationships between the different approaches and compare them all using a
variety of simulations of both randomized and observational data. Our results
show that researchers estimating heterogenous treatment effects need not limit
themselves to a single model-fitting algorithm. Instead of relying on a single
method, multiple models fit by a diverse set of algorithms should be evaluated
against each other using an objective function learned from the validation set.
The model minimizing that objective should be used for estimating the
individual treatment effect for future individuals.

is still a subject of current debates, due to conflicting results reported in
different experiments. Present understanding of the SSE is mainly based on a
particle-like picture with the local equilibrium approximation (LEA), i.e.,
spatially resolved temperature-field assumed to describe the system. In this
work, we abandon the LEA to some extent and develop a wave theory to explain
the SSE, by highlighting the interplay between wave localization and
turbulence. We show that the emerging SSE with a sign change in the
high/low-temperature regions is closely related to the extendedness of the spin
wave that senses an average temperature of the system. On the one hand,
ubiquitous disorders (or magnetic field gradients) can strongly suppress the
transverse spin Seebeck effect (TSSE) due to Anderson (or Wannier-Zeeman)
spin-wave localization. On the other hand, the competing wave turbulence of
interacting magnons tends to delocalize the wave, and thus remarkably revives
the TSSE before the magnon self-trapping. Our theory provides a promising route
to resolve the heated debate on TSSE with a clear experiment scheme to test it

(P-W) plot and the Lmax approach, i.e., estimating Linf directly from Lmax. In
most simulations, P-W estimates of the ratio total mortality / growth (Z/K
ratio) were biased beyond acceptable limits (bias > 30%). Bias in Z/K showed a
complex behavior, without possible corrections. Estimates of asymptotic length
(Linf) were less biased than Z/K, but were very sensible to intra-cohort
variability in growth and to changes in the occurrence of large individuals in
the sample. Exclusion of the largest size classes during the regression
procedure or weighing by abundance does not solve these issues. Perfect
linearization of the data and absurdly narrow confidence intervals for Z/K will
lead users to erroneous overconfidence in outputs. Clearly, the P-W method is
not suitable for the assessment of Z/K ratios of natural populations.
Estimation of Linf may be tentatively possible under very specific conditions,
with necessary external verifications. Also, this study demonstrates that there
is no way to estimate Linf directly from Lmax, since there is no particular
relationship to expect a priori between Linf and Lmax. Errors in estimating
Linf directly affect the estimate of the growth constant K and all other
subsequent calculations in population studies, stock assessments and ecosystem
models. New approaches are urgently needed for length-based studies of body
growth (e.g., unconstrained curve fit with subsequent bootstrapping), that
consider the inherent uncertainty regarding the underlying data and processes.

  Care: A Nested Multiple Imputation Approach",,,"10.1214/18-AOAS1202",,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Evaluating and tracking patients' functional status through the post-acute
care continuum requires a common instrument. However, different post-acute
service providers such as nursing homes, inpatient rehabilitation facilities
and home health agencies rely on different instruments to evaluate patients'
functional status. These instruments assess similar functional status domains,
but they comprise different activities, rating scales and scoring instructions.
These differences hinder the comparison of patients' assessments across health
care settings. We propose a two-step procedure that combines nested multiple
imputation with the multivariate ordinal probit (MVOP) model to obtain a common
patient assessment scale across the post-acute care continuum. Our procedure
imputes the unmeasured assessments at multiple assessment dates and enables
evaluation and comparison of the rates of functional improvement experienced by
patients treated in different health care settings using a common measure. To
generate multiple imputations of the unmeasured assessments using the MVOP
model, a likelihood-based approach that combines the EM algorithm and the
bootstrap method as well as a fully Bayesian approach using the data
augmentation algorithm are developed. Using a dataset on patients who suffered
a stroke, we simulate missing assessments and compare the MVOP model to
existing methods for imputing incomplete multivariate ordinal variables. We
show that, for all of the estimands considered, and in most of the experimental
conditions that were examined, the MVOP model appears to be superior. The
proposed procedure is then applied to patients who suffered a stroke and were
released from rehabilitation facilities either to skilled nursing facilities or
to their homes.

perform road segmentation using data captured by the front camera of a vehicle.
GRU network obtains a long spatial sequence with lower computational

often hinge on extensive correlations among mutations at different sites within
the enzyme, however, the underpinning mechanism for these correlations is far
from clear. Here, we present a topology-based model to quantitively
characterize correlation effects between mutations. The method is based on the
molecular dynamic simulations and the amino-acid network clique analysis that
simply examines if two single mutation sites belong to some 3-clique. We
analyzed 13 dual mutations of T4 phage lysozyme and found that the clique-based
model successfully distinguishes highly correlated or non-additive double-site
mutations from those with less correlation or additive mutations. We also
applied the model to the protein Eglin c whose topology is significantly
distinct from that of T4 phage lysozyme, and found that the model can, to some
extension, still identify non-additive mutations from additive ones. Our
calculations showed that mutation correlation effects may heavily depend on
topology relationship among mutation sites, which can be quantitatively
characterized using amino-acid network k-cliques. We also showed that
double-site mutation correlations can be significantly altered by exerting a
third mutation, indicating that more detailed physico-chemistry interactions
might be considered with the network model for better understanding of the

change of the interlayer distance due to an out-of-plane compression can

charge transfer from K and Al atoms to the InSe surface was observed, causing
an n-type conduction of InSe, while p-type conduction of InSe observed in case
of the Mg-doping. The atomically thin structure of InSe enables the possible
observation and utilization of the dopant-induced vertical electric field
across the interface. A proper adoption of the n- or p-type dopants allows for
the modulation of the work function, the Fermi level pinning, the band bending,
and the photo-adsorbing efficiency near the InSe surface/interface.
Investigation on the adsorption of transition metal atoms on InSe showed that

architectures, and reducing the risks for vanishing gradients. They equip
encoder-decoder-like networks with richer feature representations, but at the
cost of higher memory usage, computation, and possibly resulting in
transferring non-discriminative feature maps. In this paper, we focus on
improving skip connections used in segmentation networks (e.g., U-Net, V-Net,
and The One Hundred Layers Tiramisu (DensNet) architectures). We propose light,
learnable skip connections which learn to first select the most discriminative
channels and then attend to the most discriminative regions of the selected
feature maps. The output of the proposed skip connections is a unique feature
map which not only reduces the memory usage and network parameters to a high
extent, but also improves segmentation accuracy. We evaluate the proposed
method on three different 2D and volumetric datasets and demonstrate that the
proposed light, learnable skip connections can outperform the traditional heavy
skip connections in terms of segmentation accuracy, memory usage, and number of
network parameters.

analysis of the fluid flows, we find that the fluid equations can be taken as a
variant of the compressible version of the non-relativistic Navier-Stokes
equations. Particularly, in the limit of small Mach number, these equations
could be cast into the form of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with
redefined Reynolds number and Mach number. By using numerical simulation, we
find that the EGB holographic turbulence shares similar qualitative feature as

MgO, and the atomic structure of Al2O3/MgAl2O4 interfaces at different growth
stages was characterized using aberration-corrected scanning transmission
electron microscopy. The oxygen sublattice transforms from hexagonal
close-packed (hcp) stacking in Al2O3 to cubic close-packed (ccp) stacking in
MgAl2O4. Partial dislocations associated with steps are observed at the
interface. At the reaction-controlled early growth stages, such partial
dislocations coexist with the edge dislocations. However, at the
diffusion-controlled late growth stages, such partial dislocations are
dominant. The observed structures indicate that progression of the
Al2O3/MgAl2O4 interface into Al2O3 is accomplished by the glide of partial
dislocations accompanied by the exchange of Al3+ and Mg2+ cations. The
interface migration may be envisaged as a plane-by-plane zipper-like motion,
which repeats along the interface facilitating its propagation. MgAl2O4 grains
can adopt two crystallographic orientations with a twinning orientation
relationship, and grow by dislocations gliding in opposite directions. Where
the oppositely propagating partial dislocations and interface steps meet,
interlinked twin boundaries and incoherent {\Sigma}3 grain boundaries form. The
newly grown MgAl2O4 grains compete with each other, leading to a
growth-selection and successive coarsening of the MgAl2O4 grains. This
understanding could help to interpret the interface reaction or phase
transformation of a wide range of materials that exhibit a similar hcp/ccp
transition.

Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLO and FPN use FCN as their backbone. So here comes one
question: Can we find a universal strategy to further accelerate FCN with
higher accuracy, so could accelerate all the recent FCN-based methods? To
analyze this, we decompose the face searching space into two orthogonal
directions, `scale' and `spatial'. Only a few coordinates in the space expanded

anisoplanatism signature only onto PSF: for large-field observations (20"") with
single- conjugated AO, PSFs are strongly elongated due to anisoplanatism that
manifests itself as three different terms for Laser-guide star (LGS) systems:
angular, focal and tilt. We propose a generalized model that relies on a
point-wise decomposition of the phase and encompasses the non-stationarity of
LGS systems. We demonstrate it is more accurate and less computationally
demanding than existing models: it agrees with end-to-end physical-optics
simulations to within 0.1% of PSF measurables, such as Strehl-ratio, FWHM and
fraction of variance unexplained.Secondly, we study off-axis PSF modelling is
with respect to $C_n^2(h)$ profile (heights and fractional weights). For 10m

the heat diffusion in a material and the probability amplitude of particles in

otherwise. Why this connection? Is there any physical intuitive explanation? Is

algorithms often do not exploit the full potential of the computation system

starting selection procedures. Steady-state algorithms are often seen as a
solution to this problem, since fitness evaluation can be done by multiple
threads in an asynchronous way. However, if the algorithm updates its state in
a complicated way, the threads will eventually have to wait until this update
finishes. State update procedures that are computationally expensive are common
in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.
  We have implemented an asynchronous steady-state version of the NSGA-II
algorithm. Its most expensive part, non-dominated sorting, determines the time
needed to update the state. We turned the existing incremental non-dominated
sorting algorithm into an asynchronous one using several concurrency
techniques: a single entry-level lock, finer-grained locks working with
non-domination levels, and a non-blocking approach using compare-and-set
operations. Our experimental results reveal the trade-off between the
work-efficiency of the algorithm and the achieved amount of parallelism.

initially formulate the effective capacity of both channels with respect to
channel gains and user distribution. Under the assumption of uniform user

for the effective capacity of the VLC channel. We further investigate the
effects of illumination needs and line-of-sight blockage on the VLC

personalized ranking over the difficulties of question in the target set which
is used in two ways: First, to obtain initial estimates over the learning gains

the students responses. We show in simulations that MAPLE was able to improve
students' learning gains compared to approaches that sequence questions in
increasing level of difficulty, or rely on content experts. When implemented in

formation and destruction is established, mediated by a slow mode instability
(which allows zonal flows to grow) and a non-axisymmetric instability (which
disrupts the zonal flow), which is found to repeat numerous times. It is in

navigation on temporal networks -- networks where we have explicit information
about the time of the interaction, not only who interacts with whom. We
contrast a type of greedy navigation -- where agents follow paths that would
have worked well in the past -- with two strategies that do not exploit the
additional information. We test these on empirical temporal network data sets.
The greedy navigation is indeed more efficient than the reference strategies,
meaning that there are correlations in the real temporal networks that can be
exploited. We find that the navigability for individual nodes is most strongly
correlated with degree and burstiness, i.e., both topological and temporal
structures affect the navigation efficiency.

In this work, we report a comparative investigation into the dependence of the
coupling on temperature and doping in n- and p-type GaAs by using ultrafast
optical phonon spectroscopy. A suppression of coherent oscillations has been
observed in p-type GaAs at lower temperature, strikingly different from n-type
GaAs and other materials in which coherent oscillations are strongly enhanced
by cooling. We attribute this unexpected observation to a cooling-induced
elongation of the depth of the depletion layer which effectively increases the
screening time of surface field due to a slow diffusion of photoexcited
carriers in p-type GaAs. Such an increase breaks the requirement for the

show the existence of three phases- at high temperatures it is the Ideal Chain
phase, where the ribbon is well described by classical models (e.g- worm like

Ergodic phase - a ribbon in this phase might be thought of as made out of
segments that gyrate within an oblate spheroid with extreme aspect ratio; The
third phase, for cold, wide ribbons, is a direct result of the residual stress

2018) as a generalization of standard error correcting codes to handle severe
forms of tampering on codewords. This notion has attracted a lot of recent
research, resulting in various explicit constructions, which have found
applications in tamper-resilient cryptography and connections to other
pseudorandom objects in theoretical computer science.
  We continue the line of investigation on explicit constructions of
non-malleable codes in the information theoretic setting, and give explicit
constructions for several new classes of tampering functions.
  (1) Interleaved split-state tampering: Here the codeword is partitioned in an
unknown way by an adversary, and then tampered with by a split-state tampering
function. (2) Linear function composed with split-state tampering: In this
model, the codeword is first tampered with by a split-state adversary, and then
the whole tampered codeword is further tampered with by a linear function. In
fact our results are stronger, and we can handle linear function composed with
interleaved split-state tampering. (3) Bounded communication split-state
tampering: In this model, the two split-state tampering adversaries are allowed
to participate in a communication protocol with a bounded communication budget.
  Our results are the first explicit constructions of non-malleable codes in
any of these tampering models. We derive all these results from explicit
constructions of seedless non-malleable extractors, which we believe are of
independent interest.
  Using our techniques, we also give an improved seedless extractor for an
unknown interleaving of two independent sources.

with shortened embedded URLs over extended periods of time. Our experiments
with the detection protocol reveal that bots consistently account for 10% to
50% of tweets generated from 7 popular URL shortening services on Twitter. More

distinct mechanisms used to control bot groups and we investigate both in this
paper. Our detection system runs 24/7 and actively collects bots involved in

device-to-device (D2D) underlaid cellular network with imperfect channel state
information (CSI). The bounded model is adopted to characterize the CSI
impairment and the aim is to maximize the worst-case sum rate of the system. To
protect cellular communications, it is assumed that the interference from all
D2D transmitters to each base station (BS) is power-limited. It is first shown
that the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of each D2D
link can be obtained directly, while that of cellular links cannot be similarly
found since the channel estimation error vectors of cellular links are coupled
in the SINR expressions. To solve the nonconvex problem, the objective function
of the original problem is replaced with its lower bound, and the resulted
problem is decomposed into multiple semidefinite programming (SDP) subproblems
which are convex and have computationally efficient solutions. An iterative RTD
algorithm is then proposed to obtain a suboptimal solution. Simulation results
show that D2D communication can significantly increase the performance of the
conventional cellular systems while causing tolerable interference to cellular
users. In addition, the proposed RTD algorithm outperforms the conventional
non-robust transmission design greatly in terms of network spectral efficiency.

  extreme winds",,,,,"math.PR q-fin.RM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A meticulous assessment of the risk of impacts associated with extreme wind
events is of great necessity for populations, civil authorities as well as the
insurance industry. Using the concept of spatial risk measure and related set
of axioms introduced by Koch (2017, 2019), we quantify the risk of losses due
to extreme wind speeds. The insured cost due to wind events is proportional to
the wind speed at a power ranging typically between 2 and 12. Hence we first
perform a detailed study of the correlation structure of powers of the
Brown-Resnick max-stable random fields and look at the influence of the power.
Then, using the latter results, we thoroughly investigate spatial risk measures
associated with variance and induced by powers of max-stable random fields. In
addition, we show that spatial risk measures associated with several classical
risk measures and induced by such cost fields satisfy (at least part of) the
previously mentioned axioms under conditions which are generally satisfied for
the risk of damaging extreme wind speeds. In particular, we specify the rates
of spatial diversification in different cases, which is valuable for the
insurance industry.

of gravitational waves, GLADE includes inactive and active galaxies as well.
GLADE was constructed by cross-matching and combining data from five separate
(but not independent) astronomical catalogues: GWGC, 2MPZ, 2MASS XSC, HyperLEDA
and SDSS-DR12Q. GLADE is complete up to $d_L = 37^{+3}_{-4}$ Mpc in terms of
the cumulative B-band luminosity of galaxies within luminosity distance $d_L$,
and contains all of the brightest galaxies giving half of the total B-band
luminosity up to $d_L = 91$ Mpc. As B-band luminosity is expected to be a
tracer of binary neutron star mergers (currently the prime targets of joint
GW+EM detections), our completeness measures can be used as estimations of

many papers does an HG system need to make valuable predictions? How sensitive

effect does corpus size and document length have on HG results? To answer these
questions we train multiple versions of knowledge network-based HG system,
Moliere, on varying corpora in order to compare challenges and trade offs in

prove its convergence to the primal and dual optimizers. A main property of
each of these distributed algorithms is that they only require agents to

rest, partakes in relative recessional and peculiar motion of connected

the nonlocal mass of recessional energy associated with the particle is 3 times
its Newtonian mass. It follows that nonlocal recessional and peculiar energy of
the Universe are equal, and match Misner-Sharp energy within the apparent

shown to generate a 6 times higher level of matter energy than expected from
the Newtonian mass. Accordingly, the nonlocal energy density of baryons is
expected to be 6 times the standard local energy density of baryons, i.e.,
$\Omega_{\textrm{b,eff}}=6\Omega_{\textrm{b}}$. At
$\Omega_{\textrm{b}}\sim0.0484\pm0.0017$ (Planck 2015 results) this predicts a

exceptional points (EPs) at which the Hamiltonian matrix becomes defective. Due
to the complex topological structure of the energy Riemann surfaces close to an
EP and the breakdown of the adiabatic theorem due to non-Hermiticity, the state
evolution in non-Hermitian systems is much more complex than that in Hermitian
systems. For example, recent experimental work [Doppler et al. Nature 537, 76
(2016)] demonstrated that dynamically encircling an EP can lead to chiral
behaviors, i.e., encircling an EP in different directions results in different
output states. Here, we propose a coupled ferromagnetic waveguide system that
carries two EPs and design an experimental setup in which the trajectory of
state evolution can be controlled in situ using a tunable external field,
allowing us to dynamically encircle zero, one or even two EPs experimentally.
The tunability allows us to control the trajectory of encircling in the
parameter space, including the size of the encircling loop and the starting/end
point. We discovered that whether or not the dynamics is chiral actually
depends on the starting point of the loop. In particular, dynamically
encircling an EP with a starting point in the parity-time-broken phase results
in non-chiral behaviors such that the output state is the same no matter which
direction the encircling takes. The proposed system is a useful platform to
explore the topology of energy surfaces and the dynamics of state evolution in
non-Hermitian systems and will likely find applications in mode switching
controlled with external parameters.

detector and a data reformer is by far one of the strongest defenses in the
black-box oblivious attack setting, where the attacker aims to craft
transferable adversarial examples from an undefended DNN model to bypass an
unknown defense module deployed on the same DNN model. Under this setting,
MagNet can successfully defend a variety of attacks in DNNs, including the
high-confidence adversarial examples generated by the Carlini and Wagner's
attack based on the $L_2$ distortion metric. However, in this paper, under the
same attack setting we show that adversarial examples crafted based on the
$L_1$ distortion metric can easily bypass MagNet and mislead the target DNN
image classifiers on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We also provide explanations on why
the considered approach can yield adversarial examples with superior attack
performance and conduct extensive experiments on variants of MagNet to verify
its lack of robustness to $L_1$ distortion based attacks. Notably, our results
substantially weaken the assumption of effective threat models on MagNet that

and different aspects of our daily life. This topic still faces many challenges
such as limited computation resource on edge devices. In this paper, we further
identify two main challenges: the composition and deployment of data analytics
services on edge devices. We present the Zoo system to address these two
challenge: on one hand, it provides simple and concise domain-specific language
to enable easy and and type-safe composition of different data analytics
services; on the other, it utilises multiple deployment backends, including
Docker container, JavaScript, and MirageOS, to accommodate the heterogeneous
edge deployment environment. We show the expressiveness of Zoo with a use case,
and thoroughly compare the performance of different deployment backends in
evaluation.
