record to be reliably acquired by all nodes to prevent double-spending.
Recently, many blockchains have been proposed to achieve scale-out throughput
by letting nodes only acquire a fraction of the whole transaction set. However,
these schemes, e.g., sharding and off-chain techniques, suffer from a
degradation in decentralization or the capacity of fault tolerance.
  In this paper, we show that the complete set of transactions is not a
necessity for the prevention of double-spending if the properties of value
transfers is fully explored. In other words, we show that a value-transfer
ledger like Bitcoin has the potential to scale-out by its nature without
sacrificing security or decentralization. Firstly, we give a formal definition
for the value-transfer ledger and its distinct features from a generic
database. Then, we introduce an off-chain based scheme with a shared main chain
for consensus and an individual chain for each node for recording transactions.
A locally executable validation scheme is proposed with uncompromising validity
and consistency. A beneficial consequence of our design is that nodes will
spontaneously try to reduce their transmission cost by only providing the
transactions needed to show that their transactions are double-spending-proof.
As a result, the network is sharded as each node only acquires part of the
transaction record and a scale-out throughput could be achieved, which we call
""spontaneous sharding"".

particle, a map from canonical Lagrangian variables to Eulerian variables is
constructed for taking into account of the noncommutative effects. The
advantage of this approach is that the kinematic and potential energies in the
Lagrangian formalism continuously change in the infinite limit to the ones in
Eulerian formalism, and hence make sure that both the kinematical and potential
energies are taken into account correctly. Furthermore, in our approach, the
equations of motion of the mass density and current density are naturally
expressed into conservative form. Based on this approach, the noncommutative
Poisson bracket is introduced, and the noncommutative algebra among Eulerian
variables, as well as the noncommutative corrections on the equations of motion
are obtained. We find that the noncommutative corrections generally depend on
the derivatives of potential under consideration. Furthermore, we find that the
noncommutative algebra does modify the usual Friedmann equation, and the
noncommutative corrections measure the symmetry properties of the density
function $\rho(\vec{z})$ under rotation around the direction $\vec{\theta}$.
This characterization results in vanishing corrections for spherically
symmetric mass density distribution and potential.

differentiating non-congestive loss from congestive loss, our experiments
revealed two significant performance bottlenecks during the loss recovery
phase: flow control bottleneck and application stall, resulting in degradation

alleviated by carefully monitoring and tuning the TCP sending buffer growth

algorithms easily. Using emulated experiments we showed that, compared to the

improve the bandwidth efficiency by up to 133% and completely mitigate RTT

point defects (vacancies and self-interstitial atoms (SIAs)). In contrast with
conservative glide motion, climb relies on the point defects' thermal diffusion
and hence operates on much longer timescales, leading to some forms of creep.
Whilst equilibrium point defect concentrations allow dislocations to climb to
relieve non-glide stresses, point defect supersaturations also lead to osmotic
forces, driving dislocation motion even in the absence of external stresses.
Self-interstitial atoms typically have significantly higher formation energies
than vacancies, so their contribution to climb is usually ignored. However,
under irradiation conditions, both types of defect are athermally created in
equal numbers. In this letter, we use simple thermodynamic arguments to show
that the contribution of interstitials cannot be neglected in irradiated
materials, and that the osmotic force they induce on dislocations is many
orders of magnitude larger than that caused by vacancies. This explains why the
prismatic dislocation loops observed by {\it in situ} transmission electron
microscope irradiations are more often of interstitial rather than vacancy
character. Using discrete dislocation dynamics simulations, we investigate the
effect on dislocation-obstacle interactions, and find reductions in the
depinning time of many orders of magnitude. This has important consequences for
the strength of particle-reinforced alloys under irradiation.

have investigated the fluid dynamics of solutal convection in porous media.
Here we study the convective dissolution of CO$_2$ in a closed system, where
the pressure in the gas declines as convection proceeds. This introduces a
negative feedback that reduces the convective dissolution rate even before the
brine becomes saturated. We analyse the case of an ideal gas with a solubility
given by Henry's law, in the limits of very low and very high Rayleigh numbers.
The equilibrium state in this system is determined by the dimensionless
dissolution capacity, $\Pi$, which gives the fraction of the gas that can be
dissolved into the underlying brine. Analytic approximations of the pure
diffusion problem with $\Pi>0$, show that the diffusive base state is no longer
self-similar and that diffusive mass transfer declines rapidly with time.
Direct numerical simulations at high Rayleigh numbers show that no constant
flux regime exists for $\Pi > 0$; nevertheless, the quantity $F/C_s^2$ remains
constant, where $F$ is the dissolution flux and $C_s$ is the dissolved
concentration at the top of the domain. Simple mathematical models are
developed to predict the evolution of $C_s$ and $F$ for high-Rayleigh-number
convection in a closed system. The negative feedback that limits convection in
closed systems may explain the persistence of natural CO$_2$ accumulations over
millennial timescales.

generalization of the iteration of a single rational map. There has
subsequently been much interest in the study of rational semigroups.
Quasiregular semigroups were introduced shortly after rational semigroups as
analogues in higher real dimensions, but have received far less attention. Each
map in a quasiregular semigroup must necessarily be a uniformly quasiregular
map. While there is a completely viable theory for the iteration of uniformly
quasiregular maps, it is a highly non-trivial matter to construct them. In this

Specifically, this survey derives a quality model for crowdsourcing tasks,
identifies the methods and techniques that can be used to assess the attributes

become unity, the so-called fixation probability, is a central issue in the
study of population evolution. Its computation, once we are given a stochastic
finite population model without mutations and a (possibly frequency dependent)
fitness function, is straightforward and it can be done in several ways.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that the fixation probability is an important
macroscopic property of the population, its precise knowledge does not give any
clear information about the interaction patterns among individuals in the
population. Here we address the inverse problem: From a given fixation pattern
and population size, we want to infer what is the game being played by the
population. This is done by first exploiting the framework developed in FACC
Chalub and MO Souza, J. Math. Biol. 75: 1735, 2017., which yields a fitness
function that realises this fixation pattern in the Wright-Fisher model. This
fitness function always exists, but it is not necessarily unique. Subsequently,
we show that any such fitness function can be approximated, with arbitrary
precision, using $d$-player game theory, provided $d$ is large enough. The
pay-off matrix that emerges naturally from the approximating game will provide
useful information about the individual interaction structure that is not
itself apparent in the fixation pattern. We present extensive numerical support

crystal-surface repulsions lead to flat contacts with a monotonic increase of
the dissolution rate as a function of the load. Forces induced by viscous
dissipation then surpass those due to disjoining pressure at large enough
loads. In contrast, finite repulsions (exponential) lead to sharp pointy
contacts with a dissolution rate independent on the load and on the liquid
viscosity. Ultimately, in steady-state the crystal never touches the substrate
when pressed against it, independently from the nature of the crystal-surface

of low-frequency variability in the IRAC 4.5-$\mu$m band, with a photometric
RMS of only 0.11$\%$ at a 123-s cadence. We do not detect any evidence of a

FeSe. Here, we investigated high-quality single crystals of FeSe using
high-field (up to 9.5 Tesla) muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements. The
$\mu$SR Knight shift and the bulk susceptibility linearly scale at high

further the case for BH physics. Non-spherical gravitational collapse leading
to BH formation may entail very high GW luminosities during the final phase of
implosion, reaching non-negligible fraction of Dyson luminosity $\sim c^5/G $.
  Most galaxies harbor supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in their nuclear
regions. Several bright quasars detected at redshifts $\gtrsim$ 6 are powered
by accreting SMBHs of mass $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ when the universe was only
$\sim 10^9$ yrs old. We posit that creation of SMBHs occurs due to collapse (on
dynamical time scales $\sim 10^8$ yrs) of ultra-light bosonic dark matter (DM)
particles that have undergone Bose-Einstein condensation. Furthermore,
oscillations in DM Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) triggered by tidal forces
in interacting galaxies can lead to bursts of star formation in the galactic
nuclei because of frequent collisions of gas clouds due to changing
gravitational field.
  We buttress our proposal by first employing simple but tangible physical
arguments, and then by making use of Gross-Pitaevskii equation to study the
formation of rotating SMBHs having mass $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$. We also make
simple estimates of GW amplitude as well as luminosity ensuing from the time

eigenvalues of symmetric elliptic second-order partial differential operators
relies on determination of fluxes $\sigma_i$ that approximate co-gradients of
exact eigenfunctions scaled by corresponding eigenvalues. Fluxes $\sigma_i$ are
usually computed by a global saddle point problem solved by mixed finite
element methods. In this paper we propose a simpler global problem that yields
fluxes $\sigma_i$ of the same quality. The simplified problem is smaller, it is
positive definite, and any $H(\mathrm{div},\Omega)$ conforming finite elements,
such as Raviart-Thomas elements, can be used for its solution. In addition,
these global problems can be split into a number of independent local problems
on patches, which allows for trivial parallelization. The computational
performance of these approaches is illustrated by numerical examples for
Laplace and Steklov type eigenvalue problems. These examples also show that
local flux reconstructions enable to compute lower bounds on eigenvalues on
considerably finer meshes than the traditional global reconstructions.

study the nonlinear phenomena of ponderomotive forces associated to the

result for the ponderomotive force on electric charges to take into account the
symmetrical form of Maxwell equations in the presence of magnetic charges. It
is shown that the general ponderomotive force on this plasma depends
non--trivially on the magnetic monopoles, through the slowly temporal and
spatial variations of the electromagnetic field amplitudes. The magnetic
charges introduce corrections even if the plasma is unmagnetized. This last
force induces a magnetization of the plasma, and therefore a cyclotron
frequency (proportional to the square of the magnetic charge) is induced for
electrons. Finally, the magnetic monopoles also experience a ponderomotive
force due to the electrons. This force accelerates the magnetic charges along
the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic waves. The possible

modulus of tablets is studied. Two grades of lactose, monohydrate and
spray-dried, are selected. Tablets are compressed to different relative
densities ranging from $0.8$ to $0.94$ using an instrumented compaction
simulator. We propose a general model, which predicts the elastic modulus and
tensile strength envelope that a specific powder can obtain based on its
lubrication sensitivity for different particle size distributions. This is
possible by introducing a new dimensionless parameter in the existing tensile
strength and elastic modulus relationships with relative density. A wide range
of lubrication conditions is explored and a predictable model is callibrated.
The mechanical properties of lactose monohydrate tablets are noticeably
dependent on particle size, unlike spray-dried lactose where little to almost
no sensitivity to particle size is observed. The model is designed in a general
fashion that can capture mechanical quality attributes in response to different
lubrication conditions and particle size, and it can be extended to powders
than undergo different deformation mechanisms, complex mixtures, and doubly
convex tablets. Therefore, the model can be used to map the achievable design

When the coupling between the components is coherent, not only the particles
number, but also their phase texture that maps the linear and angular momentum,
can be exchanged. Here, on a system of exciton-polaritons, we have realized a
so-called full-Bloch beam: a configuration in which all superpositions of the

evolving in time according to Rabi-oscillatory dynamics. As a result, the light

ferromagnetic states in a three dimensional $t_{2g}$-orbital system to allow
for multiple holes. The system is a simple cubic lattice with each site
possessing $d_{xy}$, $d_{yz}$, and $d_{xz}$ orbitals, which allow
two-dimensional hopping within each orbital plane. In the strong coupling limit
of $U\to \infty$, the orbital-generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetic states are
proved degenerate with the ground state in the thermodynamic limit when the
hole number per orbital layer scales slower than $L^{\frac{1}{2}}$. This result
is valid for arbitrary values of the ferromagnetic Hund's coupling $J>0$ and
inter-orbital repulsion $V\ge 0$. The stability of the Nagaoka-type state at
finite electron densities with respect to a single spin-flip is investigated.
These results provide helpful guidance for studying the mechanism of itinerant
ferromagnetism for the $t_{2g}$-orbital materials.

halo, the so-called hypervelocity stars (HVSs). While the bulk of this
population is likely the result of a close encounter between a stellar binary
and the supermassive black hole (MBH) in the Galactic Centre (GC), other
mechanims may contribute fast stars to the sample. Few observed HVSs show
apparent ages which are shorter than the flight time from the GC, thereby
making the binary disruption scenario unlikely. These stars may be the result
of the breakup of a stellar triple in the GC which led to the ejection of a
hypervelocity binary (HVB). If such binary evolves into a blue straggler star
due to internal processes after ejection, a rejuvenation is possible that make
the star appear younger once detected in the halo. A triple disruption may also
be responsible for the presence of HVBs, of which one candidate has now been
observed. We present a numerical study of triple disruptions by the MBH in the
GC and find that the most likely outcomes are the production of single HVSs and
single/binary stars bound to the MBH, while the production of HVBs has a
probability $\lesssim 1\%$ regardless of the initial parameters. Assuming a
triple fraction of $\approx 10\%$ results in an ejection rate of $\lesssim 1\

shorter than their flight time. We conclude that alternative mechanisms are

It is known that a naive application of coded caching over the channel at hand

vanishing multicast rate. We overcome this detrimental effect by a careful
design of opportunistic scheduling policies such that some utility function of
the long-term average rates should be maximized while balancing fairness among
users. In particular, we propose a threshold-based scheduling that requires
only statistical channel state information and one-bit feedback from each user.
More specifically, each user indicates via feedback whenever its SNR is above a
threshold determined solely by the fading statistics and the fairness
requirement. Surprisingly, we prove that this simple scheme achieves the
optimal utility in the regime of a large number of users. Numerical examples
show that our proposed scheme performs closely to the scheduling with full

repositories of neutral hydrogen in the Universe. This DLA sample has been used
to determine the DLA bias factor from their cross-correlation with the \lya
forest absorption in \cite{FontRibera2012,Perez2018}, showing that DLAs are
associated with relatively massive halos. However, the low resolution and
signal-to-noise of BOSS spectra do not allow precise measurements of the DLA
metal lines. We define a metal strength parameter, $S$, based on combining
equivalent widths of 17 metal lines, that can be measured with an optimal
signal-to-noise ratio for individual DLAs in BOSS spectra, allowing for the
classification of the DLA population into subgroups of different $S$. We
present the distribution of this DLA metal strength and the dependence of its
mean value on $N_{\rm HI}$ and redshift. We search for systematic effects and
variations in the catalogue purity by examining the dependence of the $S$
distribution on the spectral signal-to-noise and the estimated error on $S$. A
catalogue of DLAs with measured equivalent widths for the selected 17 metal
lines and the value of $S$ is made publicly available, which will be used to
measure the dependence of the DLA bias factor on the $S$ parameter. The
relation of the metal strength on the gas metal abundances and velocity
dispersion can be constrained by studying the stacked metal absorption spectra
of DLAs as a function of $S$, allowing for future determinations of the
dependence of the bias factor on the metallicity and velocity dispersion of
DLAs.

Different attack strategies have been proposed to generate adversarial
examples, but how to produce them with high perceptual quality and more
efficiently requires more research efforts. In this paper, we propose AdvGAN to
generate adversarial examples with generative adversarial networks (GANs),
which can learn and approximate the distribution of original instances. For
AdvGAN, once the generator is trained, it can generate adversarial
perturbations efficiently for any instance, so as to potentially accelerate
adversarial training as defenses. We apply AdvGAN in both semi-whitebox and
black-box attack settings. In semi-whitebox attacks, there is no need to access
the original target model after the generator is trained, in contrast to
traditional white-box attacks. In black-box attacks, we dynamically train a
distilled model for the black-box model and optimize the generator accordingly.
Adversarial examples generated by AdvGAN on different target models have high
attack success rate under state-of-the-art defenses compared to other attacks.
Our attack has placed the first with 92.76% accuracy on a public MNIST

further extensions of the result, e.g. to ergodic random discrete Hamiltonians

adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted instances that can mislead
DNNs to make errors during prediction. To better understand such attacks, a
characterization is needed of the properties of regions (the so-called
'adversarial subspaces') in which adversarial examples lie. We tackle this
challenge by characterizing the dimensional properties of adversarial regions,
via the use of Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). LID assesses the
space-filling capability of the region surrounding a reference example, based
on the distance distribution of the example to its neighbors. We first provide
explanations about how adversarial perturbation can affect the LID
characteristic of adversarial regions, and then show empirically that LID
characteristics can facilitate the distinction of adversarial examples
generated using state-of-the-art attacks. As a proof-of-concept, we show that a
potential application of LID is to distinguish adversarial examples, and the
preliminary results show that it can outperform several state-of-the-art
detection measures by large margins for five attack strategies considered in
this paper across three benchmark datasets. Our analysis of the LID
characteristic for adversarial regions not only motivates new directions of
effective adversarial defense, but also opens up more challenges for developing
new attacks to better understand the vulnerabilities of DNNs.

supermassive black-hole binaries, cosmic strings, and a primordial GWB. For the
first time, we find that the GWB upper limits and detection statistics are
sensitive to the Solar System ephemeris (SSE) model used, and that SSE errors
can mimic a GWB signal. We developed an approach that bridges systematic SSE
differences, producing the first PTA constraints that are robust against SSE
uncertainties. We thus place a $95\%$ upper limit on the GW strain amplitude of
$A_\mathrm{GWB}<1.45\times 10^{-15}$ at a frequency of $f=1$ yr$^{-1}$ for a
fiducial $f^{-2/3}$ power-law spectrum, and with inter-pulsar correlations

limit, calculated using the same procedure. Previous PTA upper limits on the
GWB will need revision in light of SSE systematic uncertainties. We use our
constraints to characterize the combined influence on the GWB of the stellar
mass-density in galactic cores, the eccentricity of SMBH binaries, and
SMBH--galactic-bulge scaling relationships. We constrain cosmic-string tension
using recent simulations, yielding an SSE-marginalized $95\%$ upper limit on

more than centrals). Most of the quenching of star-formation happens in
low-mass (log($M_{*}$/$M_{\odot}$) $\lesssim$ 9), low sSFR galaxies

value, the physics of this condition in time-dependent, multidimensional
simulations are not fully understood. \citet{Pejcha2012} found that an
`antesonic condition' exists for time-steady spherically symmetric models,
potentially giving a physical explanation for the critical curve observed in
simulations. In this paper, we extend that analysis to time-dependent,
spherically symmetric polytropic models. We verify the critical antesonic
condition in our simulations, showing that models exceeding it drive transonic
winds whereas models below it exhibit steady accretion. In addition, we find
that (1) high spatial resolution is needed for accurate determination of the
antesonic ratio and shock radius at the critical curve, and that low resolution
simulations systematically underpredict these quantities, making explosion more
difficult at lower resolution; (2) there is an important physical connection
between the critical mass accretion rate at explosion and the mass loss rate of
the post-explosion wind: the two are directly proportional at criticality,
implying that, at criticality, the wind kinetic power is tied directly to the
accretion power; (3) the value of the post-shock adiabatic index $\Gamma$ has a
large effect on the length and time scales of the post-bounce evolution of the
explosion larger values of $\Gamma$ result in a longer transition from the
accretion to wind phases.

quantum systems leads to a new phase of matter: discrete time crystals (DTC).
This phase exhibits collective subharmonic oscillations that depend upon an
interplay of non-equilibrium driving, many-body interactions, and the breakdown
of ergodicity. However, subharmonic responses are also a well-known feature of
classical dynamical systems ranging from predator-prey models to Faraday waves
and AC-driven charge density waves. This raises the question of whether these
classical phenomena display the same rigidity characteristic of a quantum DTC.
In this work, we explore this question in the context of periodically driven
Hamiltonian dynamics coupled to a finite-temperature bath, which provides both
friction and, crucially, noise. Focusing on one-dimensional chains, where in
equilibrium any transition would be forbidden at finite temperature, we provide
evidence that the combination of noise and interactions drives a sharp,
first-order dynamical phase transition between a discrete time-translation
invariant phase and an activated classical discrete time crystal (CDTC) in
which time-translation symmetry is broken out to exponentially-long time
scales. Power-law correlations are present along a first-order line which
terminates at a critical point. We analyze the transition by mapping it to the
locked-to-sliding transition of a DC-driven charge density wave. Our work
points to a classical limit for quantum time crystals, and raises several
intriguing questions concerning the non-equilibrium universality class of the
CDTC critical point.

the radio luminosity-star formation relation has to date been studied almost
exclusively at frequencies of 1.4 GHz or above. At lower radio frequencies the
effects of thermal radio emission are greatly reduced, and so we would expect
the radio emission observed to be completely dominated by synchrotron radiation
from supernova-generated cosmic rays. As part of the LOFAR Surveys Key Science
project, the Herschel-ATLAS NGP field has been surveyed with LOFAR at an
effective frequency of 150 MHz. We select a sample from the MPA-JHU catalogue
of SDSS galaxies in this area: the combination of Herschel, optical and
mid-infrared data enable us to derive star-formation rates (SFRs) for our
sources using spectral energy distribution fitting, allowing a detailed study
of the low-frequency radio luminosity--star-formation relation in the nearby
Universe. For those objects selected as star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using
optical emission line diagnostics, we find a tight relationship between the 150
MHz radio luminosity ($L_{150}$) and SFR. Interestingly, we find that a single
power-law relationship between $L_{150}$ and SFR is not a good description of
all SFGs: a broken power law model provides a better fit. This may indicate an
additional mechanism for the generation of radio-emitting cosmic rays. Also, at
given SFR, the radio luminosity depends on the stellar mass of the galaxy.
Objects which were not classified as SFGs have higher 150-MHz radio luminosity
than would be expected given their SFR, implying an important role for
low-level active galactic nucleus activity.

efficiently implemented in realistic 3D tight-binding models of
semiconductor-based Majorana devices. The method is based on two key ideas: i)
For a given geometry, the Poisson problem is only solved once (for each local
orbital) and the results are stored as an interaction tensor; using this
Green's function scheme, the Poisson component of the iteration procedure is
reduced to a few simple summations. ii) The 3D problem is mapped into an
effective multi-orbital 1D problem with molecular orbitals calculated
self-consistently as the transverse modes of an infinite wire with the same
electrostatic potential as the local electrostatic potential of the finite 3D
device. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, we calculate the
response of the system to an external magnetic field, the dependence of the
effective chemical potential on the work function difference, and the
dependence of the effective semiconductor-superconductor coupling on the
applied gate potential. We find that different low-energy bands are
characterized by similar effective couplings, which results in induced gap
features characterized by a single energy scale. We also find that
electrostatic effects are responsible for a partial suppression of the Majorana
energy splitting oscillations. Finally, we show that a position-dependent work
function difference can produce a non-homogeneous effective potential that is
not affected by the screening due to the superconductor and is only partially
suppressed by the charge inside the wire. In turn, this potential can induce
trivial low-energy states that mimic the phenomenology of Majorana zero modes.
Thus, any position-dependent work function difference (even at the 1% level)
along the nanowire must be avoided through carefully engineered
semiconductor-superconductor interfaces.

the conditions for star formation, thanks to their ability to alter the thermal
and chemical state of dense gas in the UV-shielded cores of molecular clouds.
In this paper, we explore their role as regulators of the stellar initial mass
function (IMF) variations, using the semi-analytic model for GAlaxy Evolution
and Assembly (GAEA). The new model confirms our previous results obtained using
the integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory: both variable IMF models
reproduce the observed increase of $\alpha$-enhancement as a function of
stellar mass and the measured $z=0$ excess of dynamical mass-to-light ratios
with respect to photometric estimates assuming a universal IMF. We focus here
on the mismatch between the photometrically-derived ($M^{\rm app}_{\star}$) and
intrinsic ($M_{\star}$) stellar masses, by analysing in detail the evolution of
model galaxies with different values of $M_{\star}/M^{\rm app}_{\star}$. We
find that galaxies with small deviations (i.e. formally consistent with a
universal IMF hypothesis) are characterized by more extended star formation
histories and live in less massive haloes with respect to the bulk of the
galaxy population. While the IGIMF theory does not change significantly the
mean evolution of model galaxies with respect to the reference model, a
CR-regulated IMF implies shorter star formation histories and higher peaks of
star formation for objects more massive than $10^{10.5} M_\odot$. However, we
also show that it is difficult to unveil this behaviour from observations, as
the key physical quantities are typically derived assuming a universal IMF.

galaxy candidates with luminosities $-17 < M_{g'} < -8$ mag, corresponding to
typical stellar masses of $9.5\gtrsim \log{\cal M}_{\star}/M_\odot \gtrsim
5.5$, reaching $\sim\!3$ mag deeper in point-source luminosity and $\sim\!4$
mag deeper in surface-brightness sensitivity compared to the classic Fornax

are well represented by single-component S\'ersic models with average S\'ersic
indices of $\langle n\rangle_{u',g',i'}=(0.78-0.83) \pm 0.02$, and average
effective radii of $\langle r_e\rangle_{u',g',i'}\!=(0.67-0.70) \pm 0.02$ kpc.
Color-magnitude relations indicate a flattening of the galaxy red sequence at
faint galaxy luminosities, similar to the one recently discovered in the Virgo
cluster. A comparison with population synthesis models and the galaxy
mass-metallicity relation reveals that the average faint dwarf galaxy is likely
older than ~5 Gyr. We study galaxy scaling relations between stellar mass,
effective radius, and stellar mass surface density over a stellar mass range
covering six orders of magnitude. We find that over the sampled stellar mass
range several distinct mechanisms of galaxy mass assembly can be identified: i)
dwarf galaxies assemble mass inside the half-mass radius up to $\log{\cal
M}_{\star}$ ~8.0, ii) isometric mass assembly in the range $8.0 < \log{\cal

predominantly in their halos at $\log{\cal M}_{\star}$ ~10.5 and above.

constraints on the locations of the major snowlines is therefore crucial for
fully connecting planet compositions to their formation mechanism.
Unfortunately, the most important snowline, that of water, is very difficult to
observe directly in protoplanetary disks due to its close proximity to the
central star. Based on chemical considerations, HCO$^+$ is predicted to be a
good chemical tracer of the water snowline, because it is particularly abundant
in dense clouds when water is frozen out. This work maps the optically thin
isotopologue H$^{13}$CO$^+$ ($J=3-2$) toward the envelope of the low-mass
protostar NGC1333-IRAS2A (observed with NOEMA at ~0.9"" resolution), where the
snowline is at larger distance from the star than in disks. The H$^{13}$CO$^+$
emission peaks ~2"" northeast of the continuum peak, whereas the previously
observed H$_2^{18}$O shows compact emission on source. Quantitative modeling
shows that a decrease in H$^{13}$CO$^+$ abundance by at least a factor of six
is needed in the inner ~360 AU to reproduce the observed emission profile.
Chemical modeling predicts indeed a steep increase in HCO$^+$ just outside the
water snowline; the 50% decrease in gaseous H$_2$O at the snowline is not
enough to allow HCO$^+$ to be abundant. This places the water snowline at 225
AU, further away from the star than expected based on the 1D envelope
temperature structure for NGC1333-IRAS2A. In contrast, DCO$^+$ observations
show that the CO snowline is at the expected location, making an outburst
scenario unlikely. The spatial anticorrelation of the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and
H$_2^{18}$O emission provide a proof of concept that H$^{13}$CO$^+$ can be used
as a tracer of the water snowline.

that the intralayer s-wave atomic interaction acts effectively like a p-wave

in the present system with pseudspin spin-orbit coupling, and leads to a
spontaneous density-modulation of the pairing order predicted in a very broad

the spin imbalance or external Zeeman fields, showing a highly feasible way to
observe the long-sought-after LO superfluid phase using the laser-assisted

a new approach to generalization for deep neural networks when used for
supervised learning. Given a classification network, we propose to use a
collaborative generative network that produces new synthetic data points in the
form of perturbations of original data points. In this way, we create a data
support around each original data point which prevents decision boundaries from
passing too close to the original data points, i.e. prevents overfitting. We
show that BON improves convergence on CIFAR-10 using the state-of-the-art
Densenet. We do however observe that the generative network suffers from
catastrophic forgetting during training, and we therefore propose to use a
variation of Memory Aware Synapses to optimize the generative network (called
BON++). On the Iris dataset, we visualize the effect of BON++ when the
generator does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting and conclude that the

availability of large data sets, there is still no universally acceptable
solution for automatic sleep staging of human sleep recordings. One reason is
that a skilled neurophysiologist scoring brain recordings of a sleeping person
implicitly adapts his/her staging to the individual characteristics present in
the brain recordings. Trying to incorporate this adaptation step in an
automatic scoring algorithm, we introduce in this paper a method for
personalizing a general sleep scoring model. Starting from a general
convolutional neural network architecture, we allow the model to learn
individual characteristics of the first night of sleep in order to quantify
sleep stages of the second night. While the original neural network allows to
sleep stage on a public database with a state of the art accuracy,
personalizing the model further increases performance (on the order of two
percentage points on average, but more for difficult subjects). This
improvement is particularly present in subjects where the original algorithm
did not perform well (typically subjects with accuracy less than $80\%$).
Looking deeper, we find that optimal classification can be achieved when broad
knowledge of sleep staging in general (at least 20 separate nights) is combined
with subject-specific knowledge. We hypothesize that this method will be very
valuable for improving scoring of lower quality sleep recordings, such as those
from wearable devices.

demands are backlogged. Replenishment lead times are random, independent
identically distributed, causing orders to cross in time. We develop a new
inventory policy to exploit implications of lead time randomness and order
crossover, and evaluate its performance by asymptotic analysis and simulations.
Our policy does not follow the basic principle of Constant Base Stock (CBS)
policy, or more generally, (s,S) and (r,Q) policies, which is to keep the
inventory position within a fixed range. Instead, it uses the current inventory
level (= inventory-on-hand minus backlog) to set a dynamic target for inventory
in-transit, and place orders to follow this target. Our policy includes CBS
policy as a special case, under a particular choice of a policy parameter. We
show that our policy can significantly reduce the average inventory cost
compared with CBS policy. Specifically, we prove that if the lead time is
exponentially distributed, then under our policy, with properly chosen policy
parameters, the expected (absolute) inventory level scales as $o(\sqrt{r})$, as
the demand rate $r\to\infty$. In comparison, it is known to scale as
$\Theta(\sqrt{r})$ under CBS policy. In particular, this means that, as
$r\to\infty$, the average inventory cost under our policy vanishes in
comparison with that under CBS policy. Furthermore, our simulations show that
the advantage of our policy remains to be substantial under non-exponential
lead time distributions, and may even be greater than under exponential
distribution. We also use simulations to compare GBS to an optimal policy for
some cases where computing the optimal cost is tractable. The results show that
our policy removes a majority of excess costs of CBS policy over the minimum
cost, leading to much smaller optimality gaps.

with a stellar mass between that of the Milky Way and Andromeda. Yet it remains
uncertain how the structural evolution of these bulge-disk systems proceeded.
Most of the unobscured star formation we observe building Andromdeda
progenitors at 0.7<z<1.5 occurs in disks, but >90% of their star formation is
reprocessed by dust and remains unaccounted for. Here we map 500micron dust
continuum emission in an Andromeda progenitor at z=1.25 to probe where it is
growing through dust-obscured star formation. Combining resolved dust
measurements from the NOEMA interferometer with Hubble Space Telescope Halpha
maps and multicolor imaging (including new UV data from the HDUV survey), we
find a bulge growing by dust-obscured star formation: while the unobscured star
formation is centrally suppressed, the dust continuum is centrally
concentrated, filling in the ring-like structures evident in the Halpha and UV
emission. Reflecting this, the dust emission is more compact than the
optical/UV tracers of star formation with r_e(dust)=3.4kpc,
r_e(Halpha)/r_e(dust)=1.4, and r_e(UV)/r_e(dust)=1.8. Crucially, however, the
bulge and disk of this galaxy are building simultaneously; although the dust
emission is more compact than the rest-optical emission
(r_e(optical)/r_e(dust)=1.4), it is somewhat less compact than the stellar mass
(r_e(M_*)/r_e(dust)=0.9). Taking the 500micron emission as a tracer of star
formation, the expected structural evolution of this galaxy can be accounted
for by star formation: it will grow in size by Delta(r_e)/Delta(M_*)~0.3 and
central surface density by Delta(Sigma_cen)/Delta(M_*)~0.9. Finally, our
observations are consistent with a picture in which merging and disk
instabilities drive gas to the center of galaxies, boosting global star
formation rates above the main sequence and building bulges.

that an increase in effective chain stiffness because of base-pairing could be
the reason why under certain conditions linear chains have an advantage over
branched chains when it comes to encapsidation efficiency. While branching
makes the genome more compact, RNA base-pairing increases the effective Kuhn
length of the RNA molecule, which could result in an increase of the free
energy of RNA confinement, that is, the work required to encapsidate RNA, and
thus less efficient packaging.

two discrete excitations coupled to each other through a continuum. Together,
they provide complementary perspectives on the underlying physics of the
system. Both reproduce the rapid evolution of the resonance spectrum across
three wide temperature ranges, including a phase transition range. In the high
temperature range, the coupling between modes is due to the collective $\pi$
relaxation of the lithium ions within PNRs and in the phase transition range to
""heterophase relaxation"" of the surrounding lattice between its high
temperature cubic and low temperature tetragonal phases. The coupling is
suppressed in the intermediate range of the collective $\pi/2$ relaxation of
the lithium ions. Incidentally, the measured dielectric spectra are shown to
bear a surprising but justifiable resemblance to the optical spectra of certain
atomic vapors that exhibit electromagnetically induced transparency.

raised a number of questions regarding its origin. Many of them relate to its
lack of cometary activity, suggesting refractory composition of 'Oumuamua. Here
we explore the possibility that 'Oumuamua-like ISAs are produced in tidal
disruption events (TDEs) of refractory planetoids (asteroids, dwarf planets,
etc.) by the white dwarfs (WDs). This idea is supported by existing
spectroscopic observations of metal-polluted WDs, hinting at predominantly
volatile-poor composition of accreted material. We show that such TDEs sourced
by realistic planetary systems (including a population of >1000 km planetoids
and massive perturbers - Neptune-to-Saturn mass planets) can eject to
interstellar space up to 30% of planetary mass involved in them. Collisional
fragmentation, caused by convergent vertical motion of the disrupted
planetoid's debris inside the Roche sphere of the WD, channels most of the
original mass into 0.1-1 km fragments, similar to 'Oumuamua. Such size spectrum
of ISAs (very different from the top-heavy distributions expected in other
scenarios) implies that planetary TDEs can account for a significant fraction
(up to ~30% under optimistic assumptions) of the ISAs. This figure is based on
existing observations of WD metal pollution and accounts for observational
biases by using realistic models of circum-WD planetary systems. ISAs should
exhibit kinematic characteristics similar to old, dynamically hot Galactic
populations; we interpret 'Oumuamua's slow Galactic motion as a statistical
fluctuation. ISA ejection in individual planetary TDEs is highly anisotropic,
resulting in large fluctuations of their space density. We also show that other
ISA production mechanisms involving stellar remnants - direct ejection by
massive planets around WDs and SN explosions - have difficulty explaining
'Oumuamua-like ISAs.

has \emph{low rank} may be ill-justified. There are many natural instances
where the object in question has high rank with respect to the classical
notions of rank: matrix rank, tensor rank, multilinear rank --- the latter two
being the most straightforward generalizations of the former. To remedy this,
we show that one may vastly expand these classical notions of ranks: Given any
undirected graph $G$, there is a notion of $G$-rank associated with $G$, which
provides us with as many different kinds of ranks as there are undirected
graphs. In particular, the popular tensor network states in physics (e.g.,
\textsc{mps}, \textsc{ttns}, \textsc{peps}) may be regarded as functions of a
specific $G$-rank for various choices of $G$. Among other things, we will see
that a function, matrix, or tensor may have very high matrix, tensor, or
multilinear rank and yet very low $G$-rank for some $G$. In fact the difference
is in the orders of magnitudes and the gaps between $G$-ranks and these
classical ranks are arbitrarily large for some important objects in computer
science, mathematics, and physics. Furthermore, we show that there is a $G$
such that almost every tensor has $G$-rank exponentially lower than its rank or
the dimension of its ambient space.

where spin rotation symmetry is broken much more strongly than time reversal
symmetry. When these materials are in the diffusive regime, i.e. when they have
disorder that is strong enough to cause an electron to scatter many times while
crossing a sample, electrons and holes move in pairs that have zero spin and
are insensitive to spin physics. Working within this spinless scenario, we show
that Fourier transforming the magnetoconductance with respect to external
magnetic field obtains a curve describing the area distribution of loops traced
by electrons and holes within the sample. We present loop area distributions of
Landau levels, weak (anti)localization, conduction governed by Levy flights,
and linear-in-field resistance. Of these four the last two are new results.
Comparing these distributions, we argue that the linear-in-field resistance
seen in some topological insulators is caused by the same diffusive scattering
that causes weak antilocalization. The difference is that linear-in-field
resistance materials retain a level of quantum coherence that is usually seen
only on the surface of 2-D wires or in ring geometries. In an appendix we
include some speculative material about linear-in-temperature resistance.

observed in both gravitational and electromagnetic waves. The electromagnetic
signal began approximately 2 seconds post-merger with a weak, short burst of
gamma-rays, which was followed over the next hours and days by the ultraviolet,
optical and near-infrared emission from a radioactively- powered kilonova.
Later, non-thermal rising X-ray and radio emission was observed. The low
luminosity of the gamma-rays and the rising non-thermal flux from the source at
late times could indicate that we are outside the opening angle of the beamed
relativistic jet. Alternatively, the emission could be arising from a cocoon of
material formed from the interaction between a jet and the merger ejecta. Here
we present late-time optical detections and deep near-infrared limits on the
emission from GW170817 at 110 days post-merger. Our new observations are at
odds with expectations of late-time emission from kilonova models, being too
bright and blue. Instead, the emission arises from the interaction between the
relativistic ejecta of GW170817 and the interstellar medium. We show that this
emission matches the expectations of a Gaussian structured relativistic jet,
which would have launched a high luminosity short GRB to an aligned observer.
However, other jet structure or cocoon models can also match current data - the
future evolution of the afterglow will directly distinguish the origin of the
emission.

decomposition of the forest. Flux correlations are decomposed into those within
each absorption line (the 1-absorber term) and those between separate lines
(the 2-absorber term), treating the lines as biased tracers of the underlying
matter fluctuations. While the nonlinear exponential mapping between optical
depth and flux requires an infinite series of moments to calculate any
statistic, we show that this series can be resumed (truncating at the desired
order in the linear matter overdensity). We focus on the $z=2-3$ line-of-sight
power spectrum. Our model finds that 1-absorber term dominates the power on all
scales, with most of its contribution coming from HI columns of
$10^{14}-10^{15}\;\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, while the smaller 2-absorber contribution
comes from lower columns that trace overdensities of a few. The prominence of
the 1-absorber correlations indicates that the line-of-sight power spectrum is
shaped principally by the lines' number densities and their absorption
profiles, with correlations between lines contributing to a lesser extent. We
present intuitive formulae for the effective optical depth as well as the
large-scale limits of 1-absorber and 2-absorber terms, which simplify to
integrals over the HI column density distribution with different
equivalent-width weightings. With minimalist models for the bias of absorption
systems and their peculiar velocity broadening, our model predicts values for

blockchain suffers from major shortcomings arising from an over-regimented way
of organizing computation that limits its prospects. We propose a
sociotechnical, yet computational, perspective that avoids those shortcomings.
A centerpiece of our vision is the notion of a declarative, violable contract
in contradistinction to smart contracts. This new way of thinking enables
flexible governance, by formalizing organizational structures; verification of
correctness without obstructing autonomy; and a meaningful basis for trust.

atomic (Mg and Fe) and molecular (OH) lines for evidence of enhanced transit

of the planet's orbital motion. As a dedicated mission, CUTE will observe more
than 100 spectroscopic transits of hot Jupiters over a nominal seven month
mission. This represents the equivalent of more than 700 orbits of the only
other instrument capable of these measurements, the Hubble Space Telescope.
CUTE efficiently utilizes the available cubesat volume by means of an
innovative optical design to achieve a projected effective area of 28 sq. cm,
low instrumental background, and a spectral resolving power of 3000 over the
primary science bandpass. These performance characteristics enable CUTE to
discern transit depths between 0.1 - 1% in individual spectral absorption

equivalence with the corresponding zero-field (symmetric) eight-vertex model on

An influence of the interaction anisotropy as well as the uniaxial single-ion

critical behaviour with constant critical exponents when considering the
isotropic model with four equal triplet interactions or the anisotropic model

liberalization, which was followed by the accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in 2001. In this paper, we analyze trade patterns of Chinese
firms for the period 2000-2006, characterized by a notable increase in exports
volumes. Theoretically, in a more open economy, firms are expected to move from
the production of a set of less-competitive products towards more
internationally competitive ones, which implies specialization. We study
several stylized facts on the distribution of Chinese firms trade and growth
rates, and we analyze whether firms have diversified or specialized their trade
patterns between 2000 and 2006. We show that Chinese export patterns are very
heterogeneous, that the volatility of growth rates depends on the level of
exports, and that volatility is stronger after trade liberalization. Both,
diversification in products and destinations have a positive impact on trade
growth, but diversification of destinations has a stronger effect. We conclude
that the success of Chinese exports is not only due to an increase in the
intensive margin, related to the existence of economies of scale, but also due
to an increase in the extensive margin, related to the existence of economies
of scope.

Data is constantly being uploaded to the cloud and shared within an
organization built on a hierarchy of many different individuals that are given
certain data access privileges. With more data storage needs turning over to
the cloud, finding a secure and efficient data access structure has become a
major research issue. With different access privileges, individuals with more
privileges (at higher levels of the hierarchy) are granted access to more
sensitive data than those with fewer privileges (at lower levels of the
hierarchy). In this paper, a Privilege-based Multilevel Organizational
Data-sharing scheme~(P-MOD) is proposed that incorporates a privilege-based
access structure into an attribute-based encryption mechanism to handle these
concerns. Each level of the privilege-based access structure is affiliated with
an access policy that is uniquely defined by specific attributes. Data is then
encrypted under each access policy at every level to grant access to specific
data users based on their data access privileges. An individual ranked at a
certain level can decrypt the ciphertext (at that specific level) if and only
if that individual owns a correct set of attributes that can satisfy the access
policy of that level. The user may also decrypt the ciphertexts at the lower
levels with respect to the user's level. Security analysis shows that P-MOD is
secure against adaptively chosen plaintext attack assuming the DBDH assumption
holds.The comprehensive performance analysis demonstrates that P-MOD is more
efficient in computational complexity and storage space than the existing
schemes in secure data sharing within an organization.

the random features reduced the dimensionality of the input by more than three

of the binary black hole mass spectrum, we construct a parameterized model to
capture key spectral features that relate gravitational-wave data to
theoretical stellar astrophysics. In particular, we model the signature of
pulsational pair-instability supernovae, which are expected to cause all stars
with initial mass $100\, M_{\odot}\lesssim M \lesssim 150\, M_{\odot}$ to form
$\sim 40\, M_{\odot}$ black holes. This would cause a cut-off in the black hole
mass spectrum along with an excess of black holes near $40\, M_{\odot}$. We
carry out a simulated data study to illustrate some of the stellar physics that
can be inferred using gravitational-wave measurements of binary black holes and
demonstrate several such inferences that might be made in the near future.
First, we measure the minimum and maximum stellar black hole mass. Second, we
infer the presence of a peak due to pair-instability supernovae. Third, we
measure the black hole mass ratio distribution. Finally, we show how inadequate
models of the black hole mass spectrum lead to biased estimates of the merger

the linear sparsity regime, i.e. $d = \delta n$ for any constant $\delta >0$, a
hitherto little-explored (though natural) regime. In a standard
information-theoretic setting, where the tests are required to be non-adaptive

individual testing is essentially optimal, i.e., $t \geq n(1-o(1))$; and (ii)
there is an {adaptivity gap}, since for $\delta \in (0.3471,0.3819)$ known

original scheme with freely propagating atoms exposed to gradients from
macroscopic magnets is a fully coherent quantum process. Specifically, no
high-visibility spatial interference pattern has been observed with such a
scheme, and furthermore no full-loop SG interferometer has been realized with
the scheme as envisioned decades ago. On the contrary, numerous theoretical
studies explained why it is a near impossible endeavor. Here we demonstrate for
the first time both a high-visibility spatial SG interference pattern and a
full-loop SG interferometer, based on an accurate magnetic field, originating
from an atom chip, that ensures coherent operation within strict constraints
described by previous theoretical analyses. This also allows us to observe the
gradual emergence of time-irreversibility as the splitting is increased.
Finally, achieving this high level of control over magnetic gradients may
facilitate technological applications such as large-momentum-transfer beam
splitting for metrology with atom interferometry, ultra-sensitive probing of
electron transport down to shot-noise and squeezed currents, as well as nuclear

linearly combining the shift register contents of the dual encoders for forward

develop a publicly available tool chain, based on a combination of existing

analyze the changes in the popular community-based variant of Android,
LineageOS, and its corresponding Android versions. We investigate and report
the common types of changes that occur in practice. Our findings show that 83%
of subsystems modified by LineageOS are also modified in the next release of

out a detailed study of the profile component widths of 123 normal pulsars
observed in the Meterwavelength Single-pulse Polarimetric Emission Survey at

have been observationally shown to arise from a narrow range of heights around
a few hundred kilometers above the stellar surface. In the past the $P^{-0.5}$

dipolar magnetic field lines. We show that the $P^{-0.5}$ dependence only holds

this equivalence is no longer possible. In a non-centrosymmetric

display different degrees of influence of this lack of inversion symmetry on

{\delta} Scuti stars has no parallelism with any theoretical model.
Pre-whitening is a widespread technique in the analysis of time series with
gaps from pulsating stars located in the classical instability strip such as
{\delta} Scuti stars. However, some studies have pointed out that this
technique might introduce biases in the results of the frequency analysis. This
work aims at studying the biases that can result from pre-whitening in
asteroseismology. The results will depend on the intrinsic range and
distribution of frequencies of the stars. The periodic nature of the gaps in
CoRoT observations, just in the range of the pulsational frequency content of
the {\delta} Scuti stars, is shown to be crucial to determine their oscillation
frequencies, the first step to perform asteroseismolgy of these objects. Hence,
here we focus on the impact of pre-whitening on the asteroseismic
characterization of {\delta} Scuti stars. We select a sample of 15 {\delta}
Scuti stars observed by the CoRoT satellite, for which ultra-high quality
photometric data have been obtained by its seismic channel. In order to study
the impact on the asteroseismic characterization of {\delta} Scuti stars we
perform the pre-whitening procedure on three datasets: gapped data, linearly
interpolated data, and ARMA interpolated data. The different results obtained
show that at least in some cases pre-whitening is not an efficient procedure
for the deconvolution of the spectral window. therefore, in order to reduce the
effect of the spectral window to the minimum it is necessary to interpolate
with an algorithm that is aimed to preserve the original frequency content, and
not only to perform a pre-whitening of the data.

Nevertheless, gates optimized for vanishing noise are suboptimal in the
presence of noise. If we know the noise strength beforehand, can we design
protocols optimized for the existing unavoidable noise, which will effectively
correct the noise-induced errors? We address this question in the present
paper. We find such optimal protocols using simulated-annealing Monte Carlo
simulations. The numerically found pulse shapes, which we fully characterize,
are in agreement with Pontryagin's minimum principle, which allows us to
arbitrarily improve the approximate numerical results (due to discretization
and imperfect convergence) and obtain numerically exact optimal protocols. The
protocols are \textit{bang-bang} (sequence of sudden quenches) for vanishing
noise, but contain continuous segments in the presence of multiplicative noise
due to the nonlinearity of the master equation governing the evolution. We find
that such noise-optimized protocols completely eliminate the above-mentioned
antiadiabatic behavior.

that while developers feel that apps in general are at risk of plagiarism, they
do not fear theft of their own apps. Developers also self-report difficulties
applying obfuscation for their own apps. To better understand this, we
conducted a follow-up study where the vast majority of 70 participants failed

diversity provided by random caching, we consider two types of linear
receivers, i.e., maximal ratio combining (MRC) receiver and partial zero
forcing (PZF) receiver, at users in a large-scale cache-enabled single-input
multi-output (SIMO) network. First, for each receiver, by utilizing tools from
stochastic geometry, we derive a tractable expression and a tight upper bound
for the successful transmission probability (STP). In the case of the MRC
receiver, we also derive a closed-form expression for the asymptotic outage
probability in the low SIR threshold regime. Then, for each receiver, we
maximize the STP. In the case of the MRC receiver, we consider the maximization
of the tight upper bound on the STP by optimizing the caching distribution,
which is a non-convex problem. We obtain a stationary point, by solving an
equivalent difference of convex (DC) programming problem using concave-convex
procedure (CCCP). We also obtain a closed-form asymptotically optimal solution
in the low SIR threshold regime. In the case of the PZF receiver, we consider
the maximization of the tight upper bound on the STP by optimizing the caching
distribution and the degrees of freedom (DoF) allocation (for boosting the
signal power), which is a mixed discrete-continuous problem. Based on
structural properties, we obtain a low-complexity near optimal solution by
using an alternating optimization approach. The analysis and optimization
results reveal the impact of antenna resource at users on random caching.
Finally, by numerical results, we show that the random caching design with the

design with the MRC receiver and some baseline caching designs.

period in Earth's middle history (2.0 - 0.7 billion years ago, Ga), O2 was
likely present but in low concentrations, with pO2 estimates of ~0.1 - 1% of
present day levels. Although O2 has a weak spectral impact at these low
abundances, O3 in photochemical equilibrium with that O2 would produce notable
spectral features in the UV Hartley-Huggins band (~0.25 um), with a weaker
impact in the mid-IR band near 9.7 um. Thus, taking Earth history as an
informative example, there likely exists a category of exoplanets for which
conventional biosignatures can only be identified in the UV. In this paper, we

consequence of techniques developed for the seemingly unrelated problem of
upper bounding the capacity of binary deletion and repetition channels.
Previously, the best known capacity upper bound in the regime where the
average-power constraint does not approach zero was due to Martinez (JOSA B,

a closed-form bound that noticeably improves the result of Martinez everywhere.
Finally, capacity-achieving distributions for the discrete-time Poisson channel
are studied under an average-power constraint and/or a peak-power constraint
and arbitrary dark current. In particular, it is shown that the support of the
capacity-achieving distribution under an average-power constraint only must be
countably infinite. This settles a conjecture of Shamai (IEE Proceedings I,

drive particles to spontaneously self-assemble into a desired structure. Here,
we extend an inverse design methodology--relative entropy optimization--to
determine isotropic interactions that promote assembly of targeted
multicomponent phases, and we apply this extension to design interactions for a
variety of binary crystals ranging from compact triangular and square
architectures to highly open structures with dodecagonal and octadecagonal
motifs. We compare the resulting optimized (self and cross) interactions for
the binary assemblies to those obtained from optimization of analogous
single-component systems. This comparison reveals that self interactions act as
a `primer' to position particles at approximately correct coordination shell
distances, while cross interactions act as the `binder' that refines and locks
the system into the desired configuration. For simpler binary targets, it is
possible to successfully design self-assembling systems while restricting one
of these interaction types to be a hard-core-like. However, optimization of

engineering turbulent flow simulations. However, RANS predictions may have
large discrepancies due to the uncertainties in modeled Reynolds stresses.
Recently, Wang et al. demonstrated that machine learning can be used to improve
the RANS modeled Reynolds stresses by leveraging data from high fidelity
simulations (Physics informed machine learning approach for reconstructing
Reynolds stress modeling discrepancies based on DNS data. Physical Review
Fluids. 2, 034603, 2017). However, solving for mean flows from the improved
Reynolds stresses still poses significant challenges due to potential
ill-conditioning of RANS equations with Reynolds stress closures. Enabling
improved predictions of mean velocities are of profound practical importance,
because often the velocity and its derived quantities (QoIs, e.g., drag, lift,
surface friction), and not the Reynolds stress itself, are of ultimate interest
in RANS simulations. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework for
augmenting turbulence models with physics-informed machine learning,
illustrating a complete workflow from identification of input features to final
prediction of mean velocities. This work has two innovations. First, we
demonstrate a systematic procedure to generate mean flow features based on the
integrity basis for mean flow tensors. Second, we propose using machine
learning to predict linear and nonlinear parts of the Reynolds stress tensor
separately. Inspired by the finite polynomial representation of tensors in
classical turbulence modeling, such a decomposition is instrumental in
overcoming the ill-conditioning of RANS equations. Numerical tests demonstrated
merits of the proposed framework.

light absorption in thin films with disordered nanoholes. Two types of
disordered distributions, including stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) and hard disk
(HD) patterns with different degrees of short-range order, are studied. We find
that Bragg scattering induced by short-range order results in the appearance of
a gradually sharper absorption peak with the increasing of degrees of
short-range order ($\chi$, $\phi$). A physical model is proposed to calculate
the in-plane angularly differential scattering cross section $d \sigma^*/d
\theta$ of thin-film nanostructures with consideration of {the} structure
factor $S(q)$. Results reveal that higher level of short-range order can
enhance in-plane Bragg scattering in certain wavelengths and directions
corresponding to rich and sharp peaks in {the} structure factor $S(q)$, which
can further modify morphology-dependent-like resonances of an individual
scatterer {and leads } to {large} improvement of absorptivity in thin films.
Besides, the comparison results show that SHU structures exhibit better
integrated absorption ($IA$) enhancement than both HD and periodic structures.
And there is a transition of local-order phase between hexagonal lattice{s} and
square lattice{s for SHU structures}, leading to an optimal absorption
performance when $\chi$ is around 0.5 of interest. The present study paves a
way in controlling light absorption and scattering using novel disordered

small adversarial perturbations of the input. In other words, most images in
the data distribution are both correctly classified by the model and are very
close to a visually similar misclassified image. Despite substantial research
interest, the cause of the phenomenon is still poorly understood and remains
unsolved. We hypothesize that this counter intuitive behavior is a naturally
occurring result of the high dimensional geometry of the data manifold. As a
first step towards exploring this hypothesis, we study a simple synthetic
dataset of classifying between two concentric high dimensional spheres. For
this dataset we show a fundamental tradeoff between the amount of test error
and the average distance to nearest error. In particular, we prove that any
model which misclassifies a small constant fraction of a sphere will be
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of size $O(1/\sqrt{d})$. Surprisingly,
when we train several different architectures on this dataset, all of their
error sets naturally approach this theoretical bound. As a result of the
theory, the vulnerability of neural networks to small adversarial perturbations
is a logical consequence of the amount of test error observed. We hope that our
theoretical analysis of this very simple case will point the way forward to
explore how the geometry of complex real-world data sets leads to adversarial
examples.

Theoretical inferences on the origin and evolution of these complexes often
require robust measurements of their characteristic size, which is hard to
measure at limited resolution and often ill-defined due to overlap and
quasi-fractal substructure. We show that maximum and luminosity-weighted sizes
of clumps seen in star formation maps (e.g.\ H$\alpha$) can be recovered
statistically using the two-point correlation function (2PCF), if an
approximate stellar surface density map is taken as the normalizing random
field. After clarifying the link between Gaussian clumps and the 2PCF
analytically, we design a method for measuring the diameters of Gaussian clumps
with realistic quasi-fractal substructure. This method is tested using mock
images of clumpy disk galaxies at different spatial resolutions and perturbed
by Gaussian white noise. We find that the 2PCF can recover the input clump
scale at $\sim20\%$ accuracy, as long as this scale is larger than the spatial

the UAVs first charge the GTs by transmitting the wireless energy transfer
(WET) signals in the downlink. Then, by utilizing the harvested wireless energy
from the UAVs, the GTs send their uplink wireless information transmission
(WIT) signals to the UAVs. In this paper, depending on the operations of the
UAVs, we adopt two different scenarios, namely integrated UAV and separated UAV
WPCNs. First, in the integrated UAV WPCN, a UAV acts as a hybrid AP in which
both energy transfer and information reception are processed at a single UAV.
In contrast, for the separated UAV WPCN, we consider two UAVs each of which
behaves as an energy AP and an information AP independently, and thus the
energy transfer and the information decoding are separately performed at two
different UAVs. For both systems, we jointly optimize the trajectories of the
UAVs, the uplink power control, and the time resource allocation for the WET
and the WIT to maximize the minimum throughput of the GTs. Since the formulated
problems are non-convex, we apply the concave-convex procedure by deriving
appropriate convex bounds for non-convex constraints. As a result, we propose
iterative algorithms which efficiently identify a local optimal solution for
the minimum throughput maximization problems. Simulation results verify the
efficiency of the proposed algorithms compared to conventional schemes.

help charging service providers to improve their total profits while enhancing
customer satisfaction and maintaining power grid stability, taking into account
those uncertainties. We employ a linear regression model to estimate the EV

the profit, but also smooth out the charging price fluctuation, protecting the

system, the standard data-collapse procedure for the order parameter, carried
out with results for a broad range of system sizes, works deceptively well and
produces non-trivial critical exponents different from the trivial values

significant drifts in the `pseudo-critical' exponents as a function of the
system size. For this purpose, we employ two methods of analysis: the
data-collapse procedure with narrow range of the system size, and the
Binder-cumulant crossing technique for pairs of system sizes. In both methods,
the estimates start to drift toward the trivial values as the system size used
in the analysis exceeds a certain `cross-over' length scale. This length scale
is remarkably smaller than the correlation length at the transition point for
weakly first-order transitions, e.g., less than one tenth for $q=5$, in
contrast to the naive expectation that the system size has to be comparable to
or larger than the correlation length to observe the correct behavior. The
results overall show that proper care is indispensable to diagnose the nature

problem is to determine if it is possible to scale the rows and columns so that
each row and each column sums to a specified target value for it. This problem
arises in many algorithmic applications, perhaps most notably as a
preconditioning step in solving a linear system of equations. One of the most
natural and by now classical approach to matrix scaling is the Sinkhorn-Knopp
algorithm (also known as the RAS method) where one alternately scales either
all rows or all columns to meet the target values. In addition to being
extremely simple and natural, another appeal of this procedure is that it
easily lends itself to parallelization. A central question is to understand the
rate of convergence of the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm.
  In this paper, we present an elementary convergence analysis for the
Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm that improves upon the previous best bound. In a
nutshell, our approach is to show a simple bound on the number of iterations
needed so that the KL-divergence between the current row-sums and the target
row-sums drops below a specified threshold $\delta$, and then connect the
KL-divergence with $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ distances. For $\ell_1$, we can use
Pinsker's inequality. For $\ell_2$, we develop a strengthening of Pinsker's
inequality, called (KL vs $\ell_1/\ell_2$) in the paper, which lower bounds the
KL-divergence by a combination of $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ distance. This
inequality may be of independent interest.
  The idea of studying Sinkhorn-Knopp convergence via KL-divergence is not new
and has indeed been previously explored. Our contribution is an elementary,
self-contained presentation of this approach and an interesting new inequality
that yields a significantly stronger convergence guarantee for the extensively
studied $\ell_2$-error.

  Problem",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the maximum $k$-set coverage problem in the following distributed
setting. A collection of sets $S_1,\ldots,S_m$ over a universe $[n]$ is
partitioned across $p$ machines and the goal is to find $k$ sets whose union
covers the most number of elements. The computation proceeds in synchronous
rounds. In each round, all machines simultaneously send a message to a central
coordinator who then communicates back to all machines a summary to guide the
computation for the next round. At the end, the coordinator outputs the answer.
The main measures of efficiency in this setting are the approximation ratio of
the returned solution, the communication cost of each machine, and the number
of rounds of computation.
  Our main result is an asymptotically tight bound on the tradeoff between
these measures for the distributed maximum coverage problem. We first show that
any $r$-round protocol for this problem either incurs a communication cost of $
k \cdot m^{\Omega(1/r)}$ or only achieves an approximation factor of
$k^{\Omega(1/r)}$. This implies that any protocol that simultaneously achieves
good approximation ratio ($O(1)$ approximation) and good communication cost
($\widetilde{O}(n)$ communication per machine), essentially requires
logarithmic (in $k$) number of rounds. We complement our lower bound result by
showing that there exist an $r$-round protocol that achieves an
$\frac{e}{e-1}$-approximation (essentially best possible) with a communication
cost of $k \cdot m^{O(1/r)}$ as well as an $r$-round protocol that achieves a
$k^{O(1/r)}$-approximation with only $\widetilde{O}(n)$ communication per each
machine (essentially best possible).
  We further use our results in this distributed setting to obtain new bounds
for the maximum coverage problem in two other main models of computation for
massive datasets, namely, the dynamic streaming model and the MapReduce model.

collects data from a set of sensors on a straight line. The UAV can either
cruise or hover while communicating with the sensors. The objective is to
minimize the UAV's total flight time from a starting point to a destination
while allowing each sensor to successfully upload a certain amount of data
using a given amount of energy. The whole trajectory is divided into
non-overlapping data collection intervals, in each of which one sensor is
served by the UAV. The data collection intervals, the UAV's speed and the
sensors' transmit powers are jointly optimized. The formulated flight time
minimization problem is difficult to solve. We first show that when only one
sensor is present, the sensor's transmit power follows a water-filling policy
and the UAV's speed can be found efficiently by bisection search. Then, we show
that for the general case with multiple sensors, the flight time minimization
problem can be equivalently reformulated as a dynamic programming (DP) problem.
The subproblem involved in each stage of the DP reduces to handle the case with
only one sensor node. Numerical results present insightful behaviors of the UAV
and the sensors. Specifically, it is observed that the UAV's optimal speed is
proportional to the given energy of the sensors and the inter-sensor distance,
but inversely proportional to the data upload requirement.

action of a quantum channel on the underlying states. In this paper, I prove a
refinement of this data processing inequality that includes an additional term
related to recoverability. That is, if the increase in the measure is small
after the action of a partial trace, then one of the states can be nearly
recovered by the Petz recovery channel, while the other state is perfectly
recovered by the same channel. The refinement is given in terms of the trace
distance of one of the states to its recovered version and also depends on the
minimum eigenvalue of the other state. As such, the refinement is universal, in
the sense that the recovery channel depends only on one of the states, and it

many new features to improve power and spectrum efficiency, the basic physical
layer (PHY) structure of transceiver design still conforms to its conventional
design rationale where access points (AP) and clients employ the same OFDM PHY.
In this paper, we argue that current Wi-Fi PHY design does not take full
advantage of the inherent asymmetry between AP and IoT. To fill the gap, we
propose an asymmetric design where IoT devices transmit uplink packets using
the lowest power while pushing all the decoding burdens to the AP side. Such a
design utilizes the sufficient power and computational resources at AP to trade
for the transmission (TX) power of IoT devices. The core technique enabling
this asymmetric design is that the AP takes full power of its high clock rate
to boost the decoding ability. We provide an implementation of our design and
show that it can reduce the IoT's TX power by boosting the decoding capability

both natural and artificial chemical systems including, for example,
photosynthetic complexes and organic solar cells. The EET rate, however, is
strongly suppressed when there is a large difference in the excitation energy
between the donor and acceptor molecules. Here, we demonstrate both
analytically and numerically that the EET rate can be greatly enhanced by
periodically modulating the excitation energy difference. The enhancement of
EET by using this Floquet engineering, in which the system's Hamiltonian is
made periodically time-dependent, turns out to be efficient even in the
presence of strong fluctuations and dissipations induced by the coupling with a
huge number of dynamic degrees of freedom in the surrounding molecular
environments. As an effect of the environment on the Floquet engineering of
EET, the optimal driving frequency is found to depend on the relative
magnitudes of the system and environment's characteristic time scales with an
observed frequency shift when moving from the limit of slow environmental
fluctuations (inhomogeneous broadening limit) to that of fast fluctuations
(homogeneous broadening limit).

these operators the large $N$ limit and the planar limit are distinct: summing
only the planar diagrams will not capture the large $N$ dynamics. Focusing on
the one-loop $SU(3)$ sector of the theory, we consider operators that are a
small deformation of a ${1\over 2}-$BPS multi-giant graviton state. The
diagonalization of the dilatation operator at one loop has been carried out,
but explicit formulas for the operators of a good scaling dimension are only
known when certain terms which were argued to be small, are neglected. In this
article we include the terms which were neglected. The diagonalization is
achieved by a novel mapping which replaces the problem of diagonalizing the
dilatation operator with a system of bosons hopping on a lattice. The giant
gravitons define the sites of this lattice and the open strings stretching
between distinct giant gravitons define the hopping terms of the Hamiltonian.
Using the lattice boson model, we argue that the lowest energy giant graviton
states are obtained by distributing the momenta carried by the $X$ and $Y$
fields evenly between the giants with the condition that any particular giant
carries only $X$ or $Y$ momenta, but not both.

well-known crossover and mutation operators described in the literature. In
addition, using any of the four strategies (SAC, SAM, SBC and SBM), found to be
better than using one crossover/mutation operator in general, because those
allow the GA to avoid local optima, or the so-called premature convergence.

multiphoton super- and subradiant states which can be prepared by multiphoton
excitations with orbital angular momentum (OAM).\ Due to multiphoton
interference, the far-field patterns of the subradiant modes show directional
scattering along the excitation direction or transverse scattering with number
of peaks equal to the number of atoms.\ When more atoms are involved, we
consider structures of stacked and concentric rings, which respectively show
enhanced directional scattering and smoothed emission patterns.\ Our scheme
gives insights to prepare many-body subradiant states, and is potentially
applicable to quantum storage of multiphoton with OAM.\ By designing atomic
spatial distributions, these cooperative states can tailor the far-field
emission properties, which is useful for light collections and quantum
information manipulations.

($n\geq 3$) on the Hermitian combination $M_lM_l^\dagger$ of the charged lepton
mass matrix leads to a universal prediction of vanishing Dirac CP phase
$\delta$ if these symmetries are embedded in $\Delta(6 n^2)$ groups and if the
leptonic doublets transform as a 3 dimensional irreducible representation of

in $\Delta(6 n^2)$ by imposing generalized CP symmetry (GenCP) consistent with

perturbations on these predictions assuming that perturbations break the
$Z_2\times Z_2$ symmetry completely but preserve GenCP. It is found that if the
residual symmetries predict the tri-bimaximal mixing (TBM) among leptons and
specific CP conserving values for the Majorana phases then addition of the
above perturbations always lead to a neutrino mass matrix invariant under the
$\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry in the flavour basis with the result that
perturbations turn the vanishing $\delta$ into maximal value $\pm
\frac{\pi}{2}.$ One gets non-vanishing but generally large $\delta$ if the

for modular motion generation. An RMP is a second-order dynamical system
(acceleration field or motion policy) coupled with a corresponding Riemannian
metric. The motion policy maps positions and velocities to accelerations, while
the metric captures the directions in the space important to the policy. We
show that RMPs provide a straightforward and convenient method for combining
multiple motion policies and transforming such policies from one space (such as
the task space) to another (such as the configuration space) in geometrically
consistent ways. The operators we derive for these combinations and
transformations are provably optimal, have linearity properties making them
agnostic to the order of application, and are strongly analogous to the
covariant transformations of natural gradients popular in the machine learning
literature. The RMP framework enables the fusion of motion policies from
different motion generation paradigms, such as dynamical systems, dynamic
movement primitives (DMPs), optimal control, operational space control,
nonlinear reactive controllers, motion optimization, and model predictive
control (MPC), thus unifying these disparate techniques from the literature.
RMPs are easy to implement and manipulate, facilitate controller design,
simplify handling of joint limits, and clarify a number of open questions
regarding the proper fusion of motion generation methods (such as incorporating
local reactive policies into long-horizon optimizers). We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RMPs on both simulation and real robots, including their
ability to naturally and efficiently solve complicated collision avoidance
problems previously handled by more complex planners.

combining scalable randomized Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) methods

the two main approaches in current use in the field of crime forecasting,
kernel density estimation (KDE) and self-exciting point process (SEPP) models,
the RKHS component of the model can be understood as an approximation to the
popular log-Gaussian Cox Process model. For inference, we discretize the
spatiotemporal point pattern and learn a log-intensity function using the
Poisson likelihood and highly efficient gradient-based optimization methods.

promising candidates to instrument these layers. To optimise the sensor layout
for the decreased pixel cell size of 50 * 50 {\mu}m2, TCAD device simulations
are being performed to investigate the charge collection efficiency before and
after irradiation. In addition, sensors of 100-150 {\mu}m thickness,
interconnected to FE-I4 read-out chips featuring the previous generation pixel
cell size of 50 * 250 {\mu}m2, are characterised with testbeams at the CERN-SPS

irradiated up to a fluence of 1 * 1e16 neq./cm2, is compared in terms of charge

is foreseen during the lifetime of HL-LHC. The replacement will require several
months of intervention, during which the remaining detector modules cannot be

described by gravitational potential constituted from two components: the stars
and the dark-matter halo. The model is evolved by solving a three-dimensional
(3D) magnetohydrodynamic equation with an additional cosmic-ray component,
which is approximated as a fluid. The turbulence is generated in the system via
supernova explosions manifested by the injection of cosmic-rays.The
cosmic-ray-driven dynamo works efficiently enough to amplify the magnetic field
even in low-mass dwarf/Magellanic-type galaxies. The $e$-folding times of
magnetic energy growth are 0.50 and 0.25 Gyr for the slow (50 km/s) and fast
(100 km/s) rotators, respectively. The amplification is being suppressed as the
system reaches the equipartition level between kinetic, magnetic, and
cosmic-ray energies. An episode of star formation burst amplifies the magnetic
field but only for a short time while increased star formation activity holds.
We find that a substantial amount of gas is expelled from the galactic disk,

modified Luttinger liquid picture to a system that behaves effectively like a
higher dimensional one. We exemplify this crossover by studying the frequency
dependency of the boundary density of state $\rho_{\rm B}(\omega)$ as well as
the temperature dependency of the linear conductance $G(T)$ through the wire,
if the latter is contacted to leads. Both observables are known to exhibit
Luttinger liquid physics without driving given by characteristic power-law
suppression as $\omega\to\epsilon_{\rm F}$ (with $\epsilon_{\rm F}$ the Fermi

is modified from a single power-law to a superposition of an infinite number of
power laws. At small $\Delta\epsilon/\Omega\ll 1$ only a few terms of this

exponentially. Thus a picture similar to the equilibrium Luttinger liquid one

Especially, for the primordial case, magnetic field rarely dissipates without

social relations, which is now available within the realm of computational
social science. Such data are, however, typically proxies for one of the many
interaction layers composing social networks, which can be defined in many ways
and are typically composed of communication of various types (e.g., phone
calls, face-to-face communication, etc.). As a result, many studies focus on
one single layer, corresponding to the data at hand. Several studies have,
however, shown that these layers are not interchangeable, despite the presence
of a certain level of correlations between them. Here, we investigate whether
different layers of interactions among individuals lead to similar conclusions
with respect to the presence of homophily patterns in a population---homophily
represents one of the widest studied phenomenon in social networks. To this
aim, we consider a dataset describing interactions and links of various nature
in a population of Asian students with diverse nationalities, first language
and gender. We study homophily patterns, as well as their temporal evolutions
in each layer of the social network. To facilitate our analysis, we put forward
a general method to assess whether the homophily patterns observed in one layer
inform us about patterns in another layer. For instance, our study reveals that
three network layers---cell phone communications, questionnaires about
friendship, and trust relations---lead to similar and consistent results
despite some minor discrepancies. The homophily patterns of the co-presence
network layer, however, does not yield any meaningful information about other
network layers.

tools in information theory. Using majorization theory, Fano's inequality is
generalized to a broad class of information measures, which contains those of
Shannon and R\'{e}nyi. When specialized to these measures, it recovers and
generalizes the classical inequalities. Key to the derivation is the
construction of an appropriate conditional distribution inducing a desired
marginal distribution on a countably infinite alphabet. The construction is
based on the infinite-dimensional version of Birkhoff's theorem proven by
R\'{e}v\'{e}sz [Acta Math. Hungar. 1962, 3, 188{\textendash}198], and the
constraint of maintaining a desired marginal distribution is similar to
coupling in probability theory. Using our Fano-type inequalities for Shannon's
and R\'{e}nyi's information measures, we also investigate the asymptotic
behavior of the sequence of Shannon's and R\'{e}nyi's equivocations when the
error probabilities vanish. This asymptotic behavior provides a novel
characterization of the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) via Fano's
inequality.

Doppler velocity of Si IV line from spectral observations of IRIS, we have
determined the rotating directions of active region loops which are relevant to
the wave. On 2015 December 19, a filament was located on the polarity inversion
line of the NOAA AR 12470. The filament was activated and then caused a C 1.1
two-ribbon flare. Between the flare ribbons, two rotation motions of a set of
bright loops were observed to appear in turn with opposite directions.
Following the end of the second rotation, a propagating wave and an associated
transverse oscillation were detected in these bright loops. In 1400 A channel,
there was bright material flowing along the loops in a wave-like manner, with a
period of ~128 s and a mean amplitude of ~880 km. For the transverse
oscillation, we tracked a given loop and determine the transverse positions of
the tracking loop in a limited longitudinal range. In both of 1400 A and 171 A
channels, approximately four periods are distinguished during the transverse
oscillation. The mean period of the oscillation is estimated as ~143 s and the
displacement amplitude as between ~1370 km and ~690 km. We interpret these
oscillations as a propagating kink wave and obtain its speed of ~1400 km s-1.

for a cooperative diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) system. In this
system, the transmitter (TX) sends a common information symbol to multiple
receivers (RXs) and a fusion center (FC) chooses the TX symbol that is more
likely, given the likelihood of its observations from all RXs. The transmission
of a sequence of binary symbols and the resultant intersymbol interference are
considered in the cooperative MC system. Three ML detection variants are
proposed according to different RX behaviors and different knowledge at the FC.
The system error probabilities for two ML detector variants are derived, one of
which is in closed form. The optimal molecule allocation among RXs to minimize
the system error probability of one variant is determined by solving a joint
optimization problem. Also for this variant, the equal distribution of
molecules among two symmetric RXs is analytically shown to achieve the local
minimal error probability. Numerical and simulation results show that the ML
detection variants provide lower bounds on the error performance of simpler,
non-ML cooperative variants and demonstrate that these simpler cooperative
variants have error performance comparable to ML detectors.

redshift range of $0.8 < z < 2.2$ and a sky area of $2112.90$ $\rm deg^2$. To
optimise measurements we deploy a redshift-dependent weighting scheme, which
allows us to avoid binning, and perform the data analysis consistently
including the redshift evolution across the sample. We perform the analysis in
Fourier space, and use the redshift evolving power spectrum multipoles to
measure the redshift space distortion parameter $f\sigma_8$ and parameters
controlling the anisotropic projection of the cosmological perturbations. We
measure $f \sigma_8(z=1.52)=0.43 \pm 0.05 $ and $df\sigma_8/dz (z=1.52)= - 0.16
\pm 0.08$, consistent with the expectation for a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology as
constrained by the Planck experiment.

  for Single Image Haze Removal","10 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Single image haze removal is a very challenging and ill-posed problem. The
existing haze removal methods in literature, including the recently introduced
deep learning methods, model the problem of haze removal as that of estimating
intermediate parameters, viz., scene transmission map and atmospheric light.
These are used to compute the haze-free image from the hazy input image. Such
an approach only focuses on accurate estimation of intermediate parameters,
while the aesthetic quality of the haze-free image is unaccounted for in the
optimization framework. Thus, errors in the estimation of intermediate
parameters often lead to generation of inferior quality haze-free images. In
this paper, we present CANDY (Conditional Adversarial Networks based Dehazing
of hazY images), a fully end-to-end model which directly generates a clean
haze-free image from a hazy input image. CANDY also incorporates the visual
quality of haze-free image into the optimization function; thus, generating a
superior quality haze-free image. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work in literature to propose a fully end-to-end model for single image
haze removal. Also, this is the first work to explore the newly introduced
concept of generative adversarial networks for the problem of single image haze
removal. The proposed model CANDY was trained on a synthetically created haze
image dataset, while evaluation was performed on challenging synthetic as well
as real haze image datasets. The extensive evaluation and comparison results of
CANDY reveal that it significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art haze
removal methods in literature, both quantitatively as well as qualitatively.

method for multipleinput-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The key idea of SLM is
to jointly exploit spatial, in-phase, and quadrature dimensions to modulate
information bits into a multi-dimensional signal set that consists oflattice
points. One major finding is that SLM achieves a higher spectral efficiency
than the existing spatial modulation and spatial multiplexing methods for the
MIMO channel under the constraint ofM-ary pulseamplitude-modulation (PAM) input
signaling per dimension. In particular, it is shown that when the SLM signal
set is constructed by using dense lattices, a significant signal-to-noise-ratio
(SNR) gain, i.e., a nominal coding gain, is attainable compared to the existing
methods. In addition, closed-form expressions for both the average mutual
information and average symbol-vector-error-probability (ASVEP) of generic SLM
are derived under Rayleigh-fading environments. To reduce detection complexity,
a low-complexity detection method for SLM, which is referred to as lattice
sphere decoding, is developed by exploiting lattice theory. Simulation results
verify the accuracy of the conducted analysis and demonstrate that the proposed
SLM techniques achieve higher average mutual information and lower ASVEP than
do existing methods.

atmospheric parameters were determined through a strictly spectroscopic local

been addressed using two main approaches: (i) Approximation: the best of two

running the simple VCG mechanism with additional $m$ buyers extracts at least

suffer from severe drawbacks: On the one hand, losing $83\%$ of the revenue is
hardly acceptable in any application. On the other hand, attracting a linear

selling all items as a single bundle --- with substantially fewer additional

Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm has the potential to enable the redesign and
successful deployment of these systems. In this paper, we propose a set of
novel architecture designs for SDN-enabled mobile ad hoc networks in the
tactical field. We discuss in detail the challenges raised by the ad hoc and

them. The proposed approaches build on evidence from experimental evaluation of

interoperability. We present Gremlinator, a novel SPARQL to Gremlin translator.
Gremlinator translates SPARQL queries to Gremlin traversals for executing graph
pattern matching queries over graph databases. This allows to access and query
a wide variety of Graph Data Management Systems (DMS) using the W3C
standardized SPARQL query language and avoid the learning curve of a new Graph
Query Language. Gremlin is a system-agnostic traversal language covering both
OLTP graph database or OLAP graph processors, thus making it a desirable choice
for supporting interoperability wrt. querying Graph DMSs. We present a
comprehensive empirical evaluation of Gremlinator and demonstrate its validity
and applicability by executing SPARQL queries on top of the leading graph
stores Neo4J, Sparksee, and Apache TinkerGraph and compare the performance with
the RDF stores Virtuoso, 4Store and JenaTDB. Our evaluation demonstrates the
substantial performance gain obtained by the Gremlin counterparts of the SPARQL

A simple formulation of a compensated compactness problem is to ask for
conditions on a set $\mathcal{K}\subset M^{m\times n}$ such that $$
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}
\mathrm{dist}(Du_n,\mathcal{K})\overset{L^p}{\rightarrow} 0\; \Rightarrow
\{Du_{n}\}_{n}\text{ is precompact.} $$ Let $M_1,M_2,\dots, M_q$ denote the set
of minors of $M^{m\times n}$. A sufficient condition for this is that any
measure $\mu$ supported on $\mathcal{K}$ satisfying $$ \int M_k(X) d\mu
(X)=M_k\left(\int X d\mu (X)\right)\text{ for }k=1,2,\dots, q $$ is a Dirac
measure. We call measures that satisfy the above equation ""Null Lagrangian
Measures"" and we denote the set of Null Lagrangian Measures supported on
$\mathcal{K}$ by $\mathcal{M}^{pc}(\mathcal{K})$. For general $m,n$, a
necessary and sufficient condition for triviality of
$\mathcal{M}^{pc}(\mathcal{K})$ was an open question even in the case where
$\mathcal{K}$ is a linear subspace of $M^{m\times n}$. We answer this question
and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for any linear subspace
$\mathcal{K}\subset M^{m\times n}$. The ideas also allow us to show that for
any $d\in \left\{1,2,3\right\}$, $d$-dimensional subspaces $\mathcal{K}\subset
M^{m\times n}$ support non-trivial Null Lagrangian Measures if and only if
$\mathcal{K}$ has Rank-$1$ connections. This is known to be false for $d\ge 4$.
  Using the ideas developed we are able to answer (up to first order) a
question of Kirchheim, M\""{u}ller and Sverak on the Null Lagrangian measures
arising in the study of a (one) entropy solution of a $2\times 2$ system of
conservation laws that arises in elasticity.

It is shown that at the early stage of evolution solitons gradually decay under
the influence of weak Earth rotation. The characteristic decay time is derived
for different types of solitons for positive and negative coefficient of cubic
nonlinearity (both signs of that parameter may occur in the oceans). The
coefficient of quadratic nonlinearity determines only a polarity of solitary
wave. It is found that the adiabatic theory describes well the decay of
solitons having bell-shaped profiles. In contrast to that, large amplitude
table-top solitons, which can exist when the cubic nonlinear term is negative,
are structurally unstable. Under the influence of Earth rotation they transfer
first to the bell-shaped solitons, which decay then adiabatically. Estimates of
the characteristic decay time of internal solitons are presented for the real

electronic structure calculations, which revealed that they are actually

distortion whereas the latter originates in an electronic topological
transition. The large magnitude of the softening leads to a remarkable elastic
anisotropy in both the shear and the Young's moduli of Nb. Further
investigation shows that thermo-electrons have an important role on these
anomalies. This effect has not been noticed before. With increased electronic
temperature, it is found that all anomalies (both the elastic softening and

two incoherent optical point sources separated by a distance below the width of
point spread functions (PSF), namely in the subdiffraction limit. Recently,
researchers have achieved superresolution for two incoherent point sources with
equal strengths using a new type of measurement technique, surpassing
Rayleigh's criterion. However, situations where more than two point sources
needed to be resolved have not been fully investigated. Here we prove that for
any incoherent sources with arbitrary strengths, a one- or two-dimensional
image can be precisely resolved up to its second moment in the subdiffraction
limit, i.e. the Fisher information (FI) is non-zero. But the FI with respect to
higher order moments always tends to zero polynomially as the size of the image
decreases, for any type of non-adaptive measurement. We call this phenomenon a
modern description of Rayleigh's criterion. For PSFs under certain constraints,
the optimal measurement basis estimating all moments in the subdiffraction
limit for 1D weak-source imaging is constructed. Such basis also generates the
optimal-scaling FI with respect to the size of the image for 2D or
strong-source imaging, which achieves an overall quadratic improvement compared
to direct imaging.

define a convolution operation, $\varphi*\psi:X\times Y\to V$, by
$\varphi*\psi(x,y)=\varphi(x)+\psi(y)$. We then study the singularity
properties of the resulting morphism, and show that as in the case of

  Explicitly, we show that for any morphism $\varphi:X\rightarrow V$ which is
dominant when restricted to each irreducible component of $X$, there exists
$N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for any $n>N$ the $n$-th convolution power
$\varphi^{n}:=\varphi*\dots*\varphi$ is a flat morphism with reduced geometric

asymptotic behavior of the size of the $\mathbb{Z}/p^{k}\mathbb{Z}$-fibers of

musical elements are emphasized. In the original framework of Lewin, the set of
transformations often form a group, with a corresponding group action on a
given set of musical objects. Klumpenhouwer networks have been introduced based
on this framework: they are informally labelled graphs, the labels of the
vertices being pitch classes, and the labels of the arrows being
transformations that maps the corresponding pitch classes. Klumpenhouwer
networks have been recently formalized and generalized in a categorical
setting, called poly-Klumpenhouwer networks. This work proposes a new
groupoid-based approach to transformational music theory, in which
transformations of PK-nets are considered rather than ordinary sets of musical

stars for which $P_{\rm rot}$ could not be determined. Rotational ephemerides
for 14 stars were refined via comparison of new to historical magnetic
measurements. The distribution of $P_{\rm rot}$ is very similar to that
observed for the cooler Ap/Bp stars. We also measured $v\sin{i}$ and $v_{\rm
mac}$ for all stars. Comparison to non-magnetic stars shows that $v\sin{i}$ is
much lower for magnetic stars, an expected consequence of magnetic braking. We
also find evidence that $v_{\rm mac}$ is lower for magnetic stars. LSD profiles
extracted using single-element masks revealed widespread, systematic
discrepancies in $\langle B_{\rm z}\rangle$ between different elements: this
effect is apparent only for chemically peculiar stars, suggesting it is a
consequence of chemical spots. Sinusoidal fits to H line $\langle B_{\rm

such as image classification, to virtually enlarge the training dataset size
and avoid overfitting. Traditional data augmentation techniques for image
classification tasks create new samples from the original training data by, for
example, flipping, distorting, adding a small amount of noise to, or cropping a
patch from an original image. In this paper, we introduce a simple but
surprisingly effective data augmentation technique for image classification
tasks. With our technique, named SamplePairing, we synthesize a new sample from
one image by overlaying another image randomly chosen from the training data
(i.e., taking an average of two images for each pixel). By using two images
randomly selected from the training set, we can generate $N^2$ new samples from
$N$ training samples. This simple data augmentation technique significantly
improved classification accuracy for all the tested datasets; for example, the
top-1 error rate was reduced from 33.5% to 29.0% for the ILSVRC 2012 dataset
with GoogLeNet and from 8.22% to 6.93% in the CIFAR-10 dataset. We also show
that our SamplePairing technique largely improved accuracy when the number of
samples in the training set was very small. Therefore, our technique is more
valuable for tasks with a limited amount of training data, such as medical
imaging tasks.

Experiment (EVE) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) during the 2012
March 7 X5.4-class flare (SOL2012-03-07T00:07) are analyzed for signatures of
the non-Maxwellian kappa-distributions. Observed spectra were averaged over 1
minute to increase photon statistics in weaker lines and the pre-flare spectrum
was subtracted. Synthetic line intensities for the kappa-distributions are
calculated using the KAPPA database. We find strong departures (kappa < 2)
during the early and impulsive phases of the flare, with subsequent
thermalization of the flare plasma during the gradual phase. If the
temperatures are diagnosed from a single line ratio, the results are strongly
dependent on the value of kappa. For kappa=2, we find temperatures about a
factor of two higher than the commonly used Maxwellian ones. The non-Maxwellian
effects could also cause the temperatures diagnosed from line ratios and from
the ratio of GOES X-ray channels to be different. Multithermal analysis reveals
the plasma to be strongly multithermal at all times with flat DEMs. For lower
kappa, the DEM_kappa are shifted towards higher temperatures. The only
parameter that is nearly independent of kappa is electron density, where we
find log(N_e) $\approx$ 11.5 almost independently of time. We conclude that the
non-Maxwellian effects are important and should be taken into account when
analyzing solar flare observations, including spectroscopic and imaging ones.

Moreover, a misconfigured transport layer will introduce above 15% of energy

loss, and current leakage should be further reduced to upgrade device
efficiency and eliminate hysteresis effect. The work contributes to fundamental
understanding of device physics of perovskite solar cells. The developed model

LiFePO$_4$ persists up to 70 GPa. Further compression leads to an isostructural
transition in the pressure range of ~70-75 GPa, inconsistent with a former
theoretical study. Considering our first-principles prediction for a high-spin

experimentally observed isostructural transition to a change on the spin state
of Fe$^{2+}$ in LiFePO$_4$. Compared to relevant Fe-bearing minerals,
LiFePO$_4$ exhibits the largest onset pressure for a pressure-induced spin
state transition.

as vectors of relative values, often called compositions or proportions. The
Dirichlet distribution is a natural distribution to use for composition or
proportion data. It has the advantage of a low number of parameters, making it
the parsimonious choice in many cases. In this paper we consider the case where
the outcome of a process is Dirichlet, dependent on one or more explanatory
variables in a regression setting. We explore some existing approaches to this
problem, and then introduce a new simulation approach to fitting such models,
based on the Bayesian framework. We illustrate the advantages of the new
approach through simulated examples and an application in sport science. These
advantages include: increased accuracy of fit, increased power for inference,
and the ability to introduce random effects without additional complexity in
the analysis.

This is particularly true for many-body interacting quantum systems where no
general theorems about their stability are known. Here, we show that no such
theorem can exist by providing an explicit example of a one-dimensional
many-body system in a quasiperiodic potential whose transport properties
discontinuously change from localization to diffusion upon switching on

localization in a quasiperiodic potential at small interactions. We also show
how the transport properties can be strongly modified by engineering potential

mishandled in statistical analyses, a pattern that continues to this day. The
Dirichlet Type I distribution is a multivariate distribution commonly used to
model a set of proportions that sum to one. Aitchinson goes on to lament the
difficulties of Dirichlet modelling and the scarcity of alternatives. While he
addresses the second of these issues, we address the first. The Dirichlet Type
II distribution is a transformation of the Dirichlet Type I distribution and is
a multivariate distribution on the positive real numbers with only one more
parameter than the number of dimensions. This property of Dirichlet
distributions implies advantages over common alternatives as the number of
dimensions increase. While not all data is amenable to Dirichlet modelling,
there are many cases where the Dirichlet family is the obvious choice. We
describe the Dirichlet distributions and show how to fit them using both
frequentist and Bayesian methods (we derive and apply two objective priors).
The Beta distribution is discussed as a special case. We report a small
simulation study to compare the fitting methods. We derive the conditional
distributions and posterior predictive conditional distributions. The
flexibility of this distribution family is illustrated via examples, the last
of which discusses imputation (using the posterior predictive conditional
distributions).

nanowires as the main mechanism limiting the nanowire number density during
nucleation on TiN. Since on Si the final number density is determined by
shadowing of the impinging molecular beams by existing nanowires, it is the
difference in adatom surface diffusion that enables on TiN the formation of
nanowire ensembles with reduced number density. These nanowire ensembles
combine properties that make them a promising basis for the growth of

for seeking generalized Nash equilibrium over multi-agent networks. The
considered game model has all players' local decisions coupled with a shared
affine constraint. We assume each player can only access its local objective
function, local constraint, and a local block matrix of the affine constraint.
We first give the algorithm for the case when each agent is able to fully

and edge Laplacian matrix, each player can carry on its local iteration in an
asynchronous manner, using only local data and possibly delayed neighbour
information. And then we investigate the case when the agents cannot know all
other players' decisions, which is called a partial decision case. We introduce
a local estimation of the overall decisions for each agent in the partial
decision case, and develop another asynchronous algorithm by incorporating
consensus dynamics on the local estimations of the overall decisions. Since
both algorithms do not need any centralized clock coordination, the algorithms
fully exploit the local computation resource of each player, and remove the
idle time due to waiting for the ""slowest"" agent. Both algorithms are developed
by a preconditioned forward-backward operator splitting method, while
convergence is shown with the help of asynchronous fixed-point iterations under
proper assumptions and fixed step-size choices. Numerical studies verify both

definition, the PSD is the Fourier transform of the covariance function of
$X_t$ over an infinitely large observation time $T$, that is, it is defined as
an ensemble-averaged property taken in the limit $T \to \infty$. A legitimate
question is what information on the PSD can be reliably obtained from
single-trajectory experiments, if one goes beyond the standard definition and
analyzes the PSD of a \textit{single} trajectory recorded for a \textit{finite}
observation time $T$. In quest for this answer, for a $d$-dimensional Brownian
motion we calculate the probability density function of a single-trajectory PSD
for arbitrary frequency $f$, finite observation time $T$ and arbitrary number
$k$ of projections of the trajectory on different axes. We show analytically
that the scaling exponent for the frequency-dependence of the PSD specific to
an ensemble of Brownian motion trajectories can be already obtained from a
single trajectory, while the numerical amplitude in the relation between the
ensemble-averaged and single-trajectory PSDs is a fluctuating property which
varies from realization to realization. The distribution of this amplitude is
calculated exactly and is discussed in detail. Our results are confirmed by
numerical simulations and single particle tracking experiments, with remarkably
good agreement. In addition we consider a truncated Wiener representation of
Brownian motion, and the case of a discrete-time lattice random walk. We
highlight some differences in the behavior of a single-trajectory PSD for
Brownian motion and for the two latter situations. The framework developed
herein will allow for meaningful physical analysis of experimental stochastic
trajectories.

ice; heavy ice has a larger volume than light ice. This anomaly in ice
increases with temperature and persists in liquid water up to the boiling
point. We study nuclear quantum effects on the density and compressibility of
several ice-like structures and crystalline ice phases. By calculating the
anisotropic contributions to the stain tensor, we analyze how the
compressibility changes along different directions in hexagonal ice, and find
that hexagonal ice is softer along the x-y plane than the z-direction.
Furthermore, by performing ab initio density functional theory calculations
with a van der Waals functional and with the quasiharmonic approximation, we
find an anomalous isotope effect in the bulk modulus of hexagonal ice: heavy
ice has a smaller bulk modulus than light ice. In agreement with the
experiments, we also obtain an anomalous isotope effect for clathrate hydrate
structure I. For the rest of the ice polymorphs, the isotope effect is: i)
anomalous for ice IX, Ih, Ic, clathrate, and low density liquid-like amorphous
ice; ii) normal at T=0 K and becomes anomalous with increasing temperature for
ice IX, II, high density liquid-like amorphous ices, and ice XV; iii) normal
for ice VIII up to the melting point. There is a transition from an anomalous
isotope effect to a normal isotope effect for both the volume and bulk modulus,
as the density (compressibility) of the structures increases (decreases). This
result can explain the anomalous isotope effect in liquid water: as the
compressibility decreases from melting point to the compressibility minimum
temperature, the difference between the volumes of the heavy and light water
rapidly decreases, but the effect stays anomalous up to the boiling temperature
as the hydrogen bond network is never completely broken by fully filling all
the interstitial sites.

period of 37.96 min. It harbours a millisecond X-ray pulsar that is spinning at
163 Hz and and has continuously been accreting from its companion star since
2006. Determining the composition of the accreted matter in UCXBs is of high
interest for studies of binary evolution and thermonuclear burning on the
surface of neutron stars. Here, we present a multi-wavelength study of IGR
J17062-6143 aimed to determine the detailed properties of its accretion disc
and companion star. The multi-epoch photometric UV to near-infrared spectral
energy distribution (SED) is consistent with an accretion disc
$F_{\nu}\propto\nu^{1/3}$. The SED modelling of the accretion disc allowed us
to estimate an outer disc radius of $R_{out}=2.2^{+0.9}_{-0.4} \times 10^{10}$
cm and a mass-transfer rate of $\dot{m}=1.8^{+1.8}_{-0.5}\times10^{-10}$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Comparing this with the estimated mass-accretion rate
inferred from its X-ray emission suggests that $\gtrsim$90% of the transferred
mass is lost from the system. Moreover, our SED modelling shows that the
thermal emission component seen in the X-ray spectrum is highly unlikely from
the accretion disc and must therefore represent emission from the surface of
the neutron star. Our low-resolution optical spectrum revealed a blue continuum
and no emission lines, i.e. lacking H and He features. Based on the current
data we cannot conclusively identify the nature of the companion star, but we
make recommendations for future study that can distinguish between the
different possible evolution histories of this X-ray binary. Finally, we
demonstrate how multiwavelength observations can be effectively used to find
more UCXBs among the LMXBs.

STRING database as a benchmark, and show that our metric outperforms currently
adopted approaches for similarity computation at the task of identifying known
molecular interactions in all studied cancer types. Furthermore, our approach
does not require text annotation, manual curation or the definition of semantic

applied to different scientific domains. Our findings suggest that INtERAcT may

associated with soft scalar, graviton and photon states at the event horizon,
as number of such possible soft states is proportional to the horizon area.
However, the coefficient of proportionality between the number of soft states
and the horizon area of a black hole has not been established. Here, similar
arguments are applied to de Sitter spacetime and it is shown that soft scalar
gravitational modes account for the full de Sitter entropy
$S=\frac{1}{4}M_{P}^{2}A$ with the correct numerical prefactor in front of the
horizon area. We also find how the value of de Sitter temperature naturally
emerges in the treatment of a scalar quantum field theory on the planar patch

of nonconvex-nonsmooth optimization problems within the important framework of
Lagrangian-based methods. This genuine nonlinear class captures many problems
in modern disparate fields of applications. It features complex geometries,
qualification conditions, and other regularity properties do not hold
everywhere. To address these issues we work along several research lines to
develop an original general Lagrangian methodology which can deal, all at once,
with the above obstacles. A first innovative feature of our approach is to
introduce the concept of Lagrangian sequences for a broad class of algorithms.
Central to this methodology is the idea of turning an arbitrary descent method
into a multiplier method. Secondly, we provide these methods with a
transitional regime allowing us to identify in finitely many steps a zone where
we can tune the step-sizes of the algorithm for the final converging regime.
Then, despite the min-max nature of Lagrangian methods, using an original
Lyapunov method we prove that each bounded sequence generated by the resulting
monitoring schemes are globally convergent to a critical point for some
fundamental Lagrangian-based methods in the broad semialgebraic setting, which
to the best of our knowledge, are the first of this kind.

bimodal galaxy cluster, which is separated on the sky by $\sim$ 0.65 Mpc with
an elongation along the north-south direction. The optical galaxy density map
also demonstrates this bimodality. We estimate sub-cluster ICM temperatures of
5.17$^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$ keV for A0141N and 5.23$^{+0.24}_{-0.23}$ keV for
A0141S. We obtain X-ray morphological parameters w = 0.034$\pm{0.004}$, c =

that both sub-clusters are moderately disturbed non-cool core structures. We
find a slight brightness jump in the bridge region, and yet, there is still an
absence of strong X-ray emitting gas between sub-clusters. We discover a
significantly hotspot ($\sim$ 10 keV) between sub-clusters, and a Mach number
$\textit{M}$ = 1.69$^{+0.40}_{-0.37}$ is obtained by using the temperature jump
condition. However, we did not find direct evidence for shock-heating between
sub-clusters. We estimate the sub-clusters' central entropies as $K_{0}$ > 100
keV cm$^{2}$, which indicates that the sub-clusters are not cool cores. We find
some evidence that the system undergoes an off-axis collision; however, the
cores of each sub-clusters have not yet been destroyed. Due to the orientation
of X-ray tails of sub-clusters, we suggest that the northern sub-cluster moves
through the south-west direction, and the southern cluster moves through the
north-east direction. In conclusion, we are witnessing an earlier phase of
close core passage between sub-clusters.

the main decay mode is an Auger process involving two electrons in the valence
shell. After Auger decay, the nuclear wavepackets of the transient

either to separated atomic ions or long-lived quasi-bound states. By using an
x-ray pump and an x-ray probe pulse tuned above the \textit{K}-shell ionization
threshold of the nitrogen molecule, we are able to observe ion dissociation in
progress by measuring the time-dependent kinetic energy releases of different
breakup channels. We simulated the measurements on N$_2$ with a molecular
dynamics model that accounts for \textit{K}-shell ionization, Auger decay, and
the time evolution of the nuclear wavepackets. In addition to explaining the

which represent a selection from a set of possibilities resp. domain. For
faultless conversation sender and receiver of information must have the same
definition of the domain (e.g. of language vocabulary). Up to now the
definition of the domain and of its elements is derived from context and
knowledge. The internet provides an additional important possibility: A link to
a conjoint uniform definition of the domain at unique location on the internet.
The associated basic information structure is called ""Domain Vector"" (DV) and
has the structure ""UL (of the domain definition) plus sequence of numbers"". The
""UL"" is not only ""Uniform Locator"" of the domain definition. It also identifies
a certain kind of information for later comparison and search. It can be a
Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or an abbreviated equivalent, e.g. a hierarchic
numeric pointer or a short local pointer to a table with global internet
pointers. The DV structure can be used as general carrier of information which
is language independent and more precise than language. A domain which contains
DVs is called ""Domain Space"" (DS) and is defined as metric space. This allows
similarity search according to user defined criteria, so that any kind of
definable information can be made comparable and searchable according to user
selected (relevant) and objectifiable (globally uniform) criteria. DS
definitions can be reused in new DS definitions. Their elements, the DVs, are
automatically globally uniformly identified and defined. Obviously such
conjoint definition of comparable information has great potential. It also can
avoid interoperability problems and redundant programming and so save high

(SMC) using the Magellanic Cloud Photometric Survey (MCPS) and Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE III) photometric data. This is a first
of its kind map of metallicity up to a radius of $\sim$ 2.5$^{\circ}$. We
identify the RGB in the V, (V$-$I) colour magnitude diagrams of small
subregions of varying sizes in both data sets. We use the slope of the RGB as
an indicator of the average metallicity of a subregion, and calibrate the RGB
slope to metallicity using available spectroscopic data for selected
subregions. The average metallicity of the SMC is found to be [Fe/H] = $-$0.94
dex ($\sigma$[Fe/H] = 0.09) from OGLE III, and [Fe/H] = $-$0.95 dex
($\sigma$[Fe/H] = 0.08) from MCPS. We confirm a shallow but significant
metallicity gradient within the inner SMC up to a radius of 2.5$^{\circ}$
($-$0.045$\pm$0.004 dex deg$^{-1}$ to $-$0.067$\pm$0.006 dex deg$^{-1}$).

notion of the structure entropy to measure the force of the graph to resist
cascading failure of strategic virus attacks. We show that for any connected
network $G$, the resistance of $G$ is
$\mathcal{R}(G)=\mathcal{H}^1(G)-\mathcal{H}^2(G)$, where $\mathcal{H}^1(G)$
and $\mathcal{H}^2(G)$ are the one- and two-dimensional structure entropy of
$G$, respectively. According to this, we define the notion of {\it security
index of a graph} to be the normalized resistance, that is, $\theta
(G)=\frac{\mathcal{R}(G)}{\mathcal{H}^1(H)}$. We say that a connected graph is
an $(n,\theta)$-{\it resistor graph}, if $G$ has $n$ vertices and has security
index $\theta (G)\geq\theta$. We show that trees and grid graphs are
$(n,\theta)$-resistor graphs for large constant $\theta$, that the graphs with
bounded degree $d$ and $n$ vertices, are $(n,\frac{2}{d}-o(1))$-resistor
graphs, and that for a graph $G$ generated by the security model
\cite{LLPZ2015, LP2016}, with high probability, $G$ is an $(n,\theta)$-resistor
graph, for a constant $\theta$ arbitrarily close to $1$, provided that $n$ is
sufficiently large. To the opposite side, we show that expander graphs are not
good resistor graphs, in the sense that, there is a global constant
$\theta_0<1$ such that expander graphs cannot be $(n,\theta)$-resistor graph
for any $\theta\geq\theta_0$. In particular, for the complete graph $G$, the
resistance of $G$ is a constant $O(1)$, and hence the security index of $G$ is
$\theta (G)=o(1)$. Finally, we show that for any simple and connected graph
$G$, if $G$ is an $(n, 1-o(1))$-resistor graph, then there is a large $k$ such
that the $k$-th largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of $G$ is $o(1)$, giving
rise to an algebraic characterization for the graphs that are secure against
intentional virus attack.

particle lifetime, which is the time taken for a diffusing particle to exit by
hitting an absorbing boundary. Calculating the particle lifetime provides
valuable information, for example, by allowing us to compare the timescale of
diffusion and the timescale of reaction, thereby helping us to develop
appropriate mathematical models. Previous methods to quantify particle
lifetimes focus on the mean particle lifetime. Here, we take a different
approach and present a simple method for calculating the maximum particle
lifetime. This is the time after which only a small specified proportion of
particles in an ensemble remain in the system. Our approach produces accurate
estimates of the maximum particle lifetime, whereas the mean particle lifetime
always underestimates this value compared with data from stochastic
simulations. Furthermore, we find that differences between the mean and maximum
particle lifetimes become increasingly important when considering diffusion
hindered by obstacles.

space would confirm the existence of a preferred reference frame. To this end,
however, the velocity of light in the interferometers cannot be the same
parameter 'c' of Lorentz transformations. Thus, for the earth velocity of 370
km/s, a fundamental 10^(-15) light anisotropy, as presently observed in vacuum
and in solid dielectrics, could reveal a 10^(-9) difference in the vacuum
refractivity between an ideal freely-falling frame and an apparatus on the
earth surface. In this perspective, the stochastic nature of the vacuum could
explain the irregular character of the signal and the substantial reduction of
its statistical average (10^(-18) or smaller). For the same v=370 km/s the
different refractivity, about 10^(-4) and 10^(-5) for air or helium at
atmospheric pressure, could also explain the observed anisotropy, respectively
about 10^(-10) and 10^(-11). The mechanism enhancing the signal in gaseous
matter, but ineffective in solid dielectrics, is naturally identified in a
non-local, temperature gradient of a fraction of millikelvin. This is found in
all classical experiments and might ultimately reflect the CMB temperature
dipole or the fundamental energy flow in a Lorentz-non-invariant vacuum.
Clarification requires dedicated experiments and improvements in the data
analysis.

unlicensed (LTE-U) coexist on the same channel in the unlicensed 5 GHz band.
Since beacon transmission is the first step in starting the association process
in Wi-Fi, we define association fairness as how fair LTE-U is in allowing Wi-Fi
to start transmitting beacons on a channel that it occupies with a very large
duty cycle. According to the LTE-U specification, if a LTE-U base station
determines that a channel is vacant, it can transmit for up to 20 ms and turn
OFF for only 1 ms, resulting in a duty cycle of 95%. In an area with heavy
spectrum usage, there will be cases when a Wi-Fi access point wishes to share
the same channel, as it does today with Wi-Fi. We study, both theoretically and
experimentally, the effect that such a large LTE-U duty cycle can have on the
association process, specifically Wi-Fi beacon transmission and reception. We
demonstrate via an experimental set-up using National Instrument (NI) USRPs
that a significant percentage of Wi-Fi beacons will either not be transmitted
in a timely fashion or will not be received at the LTE-U BS thus making it
difficult for the LTE-U BS to adapt its duty cycle in response to the Wi-Fi
usage. Our experimental results corroborate our theoretical analysis. We
compare the results with Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi coexistence and demonstrate that
LTE-U/Wi-Fi coexistence is not fair when it comes to initial association since
there is a much larger percentage of beacon errors in the latter case. Hence,
the results in the paper indicate that in order to maintain association
fairness, a LTE-U BS should not transmit at such high duty cycles, even if it
deems the channel to be vacant.

Language (DSL). To realize an efficient in-database integration, DAnA
accelerators contain a novel hardware structure, Striders, that directly
interface with the buffer pool of the database. Striders extract, cleanse, and
process the training data tuples that are consumed by a multi-threaded FPGA
engine that executes the analytics algorithm. We integrate DAnA with PostgreSQL
to generate hardware accelerators for a range of real-world and synthetic
datasets running diverse ML algorithms. Results show that DAnA-enhanced
PostgreSQL provides, on average, 8.3x end-to-end speedup for real datasets,
with a maximum of 28.2x. Moreover, DAnA-enhanced PostgreSQL is, on average,
4.0x faster than the multi-threaded Apache MADLib running on Greenplum. DAnA
provides these benefits while hiding the complexity of hardware design from
data scientists and allowing them to express the algorithm in =30-60 lines of
Python.

are ""in sync"" with each other, was shown to result in smoother social
interactions, improved collaboration, and improved interpersonal outcomes. In
this work, we are first to investigate automatic prediction of low rapport
during natural interactions within small groups. This task is challenging given
that rapport only manifests in subtle non-verbal signals that are, in addition,
subject to influences of group dynamics as well as inter-personal
idiosyncrasies. We record videos of unscripted discussions of three to four
people using a multi-view camera system and microphones. We analyse a rich set
of non-verbal signals for rapport detection, namely facial expressions, hand
motion, gaze, speaker turns, and speech prosody. Using facial features, we can
detect low rapport with an average precision of 0.7 (chance level at 0.25),
while incorporating prior knowledge of participants' personalities can even
achieve early prediction without a drop in performance. We further provide a
detailed analysis of different feature sets and the amount of information
contained in different temporal segments of the interactions.

focus is on congestion control at the intersections which result from unclear
ahead. For this purpose, a city lane and intersection model has been proposed
to manage vehicle mobility. It shows the actual vehicle to vehicle and vehicle
to traffic infrastructure communication. The experiment was conducted using
Network Simulator 2 (NS 2). The implementation required modelling the road side
unit, traffic control unit, and on-board unit along the roadside. In the
simulation, including traffic volume, the distance between two signals,
end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, throughput and packet lost were taken
into consideration. These parameters ensure efficient communication between the
traffic signals. This results in improved congestion control and road safety,
since the vehicles will be signalled not to enter the junction box and

optimization problem is formulated to find the optimal policy. Content
popularity in terms of time and space is considered from the perspective of
regional users. We propose an online content popularity prediction algorithm by
leveraging the content features and user preferences, and an offline user
preference learning algorithm by using the {online gradient descent} (OGD)
method and the {follow the (proximally) regularized leader} (FTRL-Proximal)
method. Our proposed edge caching policy not only can promptly predict the
future content popularity in an online fashion with low complexity, {but also}
can track the content popularity with spatial and temporal popularity dynamic
in time without delay. Furthermore, we design two learning based edge caching
architectures. Moreover, we theoretically derive the upper bound of the
popularity prediction error, the lower bound of the cache hit rate, and the
regret bound of the overall cache hit rate of our proposed edge caching policy.
Simulation results show that the overall cache hit rate of our proposed policy
is superior to those of the traditional policies and asymptotically approaches
the optimal performance.

multiple indoor access points (APs) equipped with outdoor energy harvesters are
connected with a central control unit via backhaul links. Further, such APs
exploit the harnessed green energy to recharge wirelessly indoor devices under
the coordination of the control unit. Considering the network, we focus on AP
selection and beamforming optimization to maximize the total energy harvesting
(EH) rate. The resulting mathematical problem has the form of mixed-integer
optimization that is intractable to solve. Thus, we propose an algorithm to
tackle this difficulty. Through numerical results, we show the advantages of
the cell-less design over the conventional small-cell one to validate our
ideas. In particular, the issue on safety requirements of human exposure to RF
radiation is discussed. Finally, potential future research is provided.

physical and biological processes performed by a biothermodynamic
system/cell/organism. Both living organisms and inanimate objects are subject
to aging, a biological and physicochemical process characterized by changes in
biological and thermodynamic state. Thus, the same physical laws govern
processes in both animate and inanimate matter. All life processes lead to
change of an organism's state. The change of biological and thermodynamic state
of an organism in time underlies all of three kinds of aging (chronological,
biological and thermodynamic). Life and aging of an organism both start at the
moment of fertilization and continue through entire lifespan. Fertilization
represents formation of a new organism. The new organism represents a new
thermodynamic system. From the very beginning, it changes its state by changing
thermodynamic parameters. The change of thermodynamic parameters is observed as
aging and can be related to change in entropy. Entropy is thus the parameter
that is related to all others and describes aging in the best manner. In the
beginning, entropy change appears as a consequence of accumulation of matter
(growth). Later, decomposition and configurational changes dominate, as a
consequence of various chemical reactions (free radical, decomposition,
fragmentation, accumulation of lipofuscin-like substances...).

possibly incur cascading failure to a grid. This paper quantifies the
criticality of substation protective relays with the combination of the outage

seven altimetric sensors (three low-cost GNSS receivers, one inertial

h of data collected over the sea in the (35-2194) m altitude range. At low
altitudes (H $<$ 70 m) radar and barometric altimeters provide the best
performances, while GNSS data are used only for barometer calibration as they
are affected by a large noise due to the multipath from the sea. The $\sim$ 1 m
median standard deviation at 50 m altitude affects the estimation of the ground
radioisotope abundances with an uncertainty less than 1.3%. The GNSS
double-difference post-processing enhanced significantly the data quality for H

between the reconstructed and measured GPS antennas distances. Flying at 100 m
the estimated uncertainty on the ground total activity due to the uncertainty
