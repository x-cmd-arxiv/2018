  Learning","17 pages, 20 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a reinforcement learning approach for real-time exposure control
of a mobile camera that is personalizable. Our approach is based on Markov
Decision Process (MDP). In the camera viewfinder or live preview mode, given
the current frame, our system predicts the change in exposure so as to optimize
the trade-off among image quality, fast convergence, and minimal temporal
oscillation. We model the exposure prediction function as a fully convolutional
neural network that can be trained through Gaussian policy gradient in an
end-to-end fashion. As a result, our system can associate scene semantics with
exposure values; it can also be extended to personalize the exposure
adjustments for a user and device. We improve the learning performance by
incorporating an adaptive metering module that links semantics with exposure.
This adaptive metering module generalizes the conventional spot or matrix
metering techniques. We validate our system using the MIT FiveK and our own
datasets captured using iPhone 7 and Google Pixel. Experimental results show
that our system exhibits stable real-time behavior while improving visual
quality compared to what is achieved through native camera control.

that of estimating the frequency moments $F_p$ for $0 < p < 2$ of an underlying
$n$-dimensional vector presented as a sequence of additive updates in a stream.
It is well-known that using $p$-stable distributions one can approximate any of
these moments up to a multiplicative $(1+\epsilon)$-factor using
$O(\epsilon^{-2} \log n)$ bits of space, and this space bound is optimal up to
a constant factor in the turnstile streaming model. We show that surprisingly,
if one instead considers the popular random-order model of insertion-only
streams, in which the updates to the underlying vector arrive in a random
order, then one can beat this space bound and achieve $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2}
+ \log n)$ bits of space, where the $\tilde{O}$ hides poly$(\log(1/\epsilon) +
\log \log n)$ factors. If $\epsilon^{-2} \approx \log n$, this represents a
roughly quadratic improvement in the space achievable in turnstile streams. Our
algorithm is in fact deterministic, and we show our space bound is optimal up
to poly$(\log(1/\epsilon) + \log \log n)$ factors for deterministic algorithms
in the random order model. We also obtain a similar improvement in space for $p

turbulence in a first order phase transitions. We focus in particular on the
role of decorrelation of incompressible (solenoidal) homogeneous isotropic
turbulence, which is dominated by the sweeping effect. The sweeping effect
describes that turbulent decorrelation is primarily due to the small scale
eddies being swept with by large scale eddies in a stochastic manner. This
effect reduces the gravitational wave signal produced by incompressible MHD
turbulence by around an order of magnitude compared to previous studies.
Additionally, we find a more complicated dependence for the spectral shape of
the gravitational wave spectrum on the energy density sourced by solenoidal
modes (magnetic and kinetic). The high frequency tail follows either a
$k^{-5/3}$ or a $k^{-8/3}$ power law for large and small solenoidal turbulence
density parameter, respectively. Further, magnetic helicity tends to increase
the gravitational wave energy at low frequencies. Moreover, we show how
solenoidal modes might impact the gravitational wave spectrum from dilatational
modes e.g. sound waves. We find that solenoidal modes greatly affect the shape
of the gravitational wave spectrum due to the sweeping effect on the
dilatational modes. For a high velocity flow, one expects a $k^{-2}$ high
frequency tail, due to sweeping. In contrast, for a low velocity flow and a
sound wave dominated flow, we expect a $k^{-3}$ high frequency tail. If neither
of these limiting cases is realized, the gravitational wave spectrum may be a
broken power law with index between -2 and -3, extending up to the frequency at
which the source is damped by viscous dissipation.

the tradeoff between visual quality and scanning robustness. Our method locally
adjusts the luminance of each module by estimating the probability of

strategy to enhance the visual quality of aesthetic QR codes, which
sequentially generate the following three codes: a binary aesthetic QR code, a
grayscale aesthetic QR code, and the final color aesthetic QR code. Our
approach also can be used to create QR codes with different visual styles by
adjusting some initialization parameters. User surveys and decoding experiments

challenges when multiple visual sources are combined to accurately guide the

approach using hybrid multi-camera input data to lead a robot arm accurately to
dynamically moving target points in the presence of partial occlusions. The
approach uses four RGBD sensors as Eye-to-Hand (EtoH) visual input, and an
arm-mounted stereo camera as Eye-in-Hand (EinH). A Master supervisor task
selects between using the EtoH or the EinH, depending on the distance between
the robot and target. The Master also selects the subset of EtoH cameras that
best perceive the target. When the EinH sensor is used, if the target becomes
occluded or goes out of the sensor's view-frustum, the Master switches back to
the EtoH sensors to re-track the object. Using this adaptive visual input data,
the robot is then controlled using an iterative planner that uses position,
orientation and joint configuration to estimate the trajectory. Since the
target is dynamic, this trajectory is updated every time-step. Experiments show
good performance in four different situations: tracking a ball, targeting a
bulls-eye, guiding a straw to a mouth and delivering an item to a moving hand.
The experiments cover both simple situations such as a ball that is mostly
visible from all cameras, and more complex situations such as the mouth which
is partially occluded from some of the sensors.

from different institutions, assembled on tissue microarrays. The combinatorial
analysis generates an optimal rank ordering of protein-expression coherence.
The outcome of the analysis corresponds to all the single observations
scattered over several publications and integrates them in one context. This
means all these scattered observations can also be deduced from one TMA
experiment. A comprehensive statistical meta-analysis of the TMA data suggests
the existence of a superposition of three basic coherence situations, and
offers the opportunity to analyze these data properties with additional
real-world data and synthetic data in more detail. The presented algorithm
gives molecular pathologists a tool to extract dependency information from TMA
data. Beyond this practical benefit, some light was shed on how dependency
aspects might be imprinted into expression data. This will certainly foster the
refinement of algorithms to reconstruct dependency networks. The implementation
of the algorithm is at the moment not end-user suitable, but available on
request.

massive MIMO setup, where the Base Station (BS) has $M \gg 1$ antennas. We
consider a block fading channel model where the $M$-dim channel vector of each
user remains almost constant over a \textit{coherence block} (CB) containing
$D_c$ signal dimensions. We study a setting in which the number of potential
users $K_c$ assigned to a specific CB is much larger than the dimension of the
CB $D_c$ ($K_c \gg D_c$) but at each time slot only $A_c \ll K_c$ of them are
active. Most of the previous results, based on compressed sensing, require that
$A_c\le D_c$, which is a bottleneck in massive deployment scenarios such as
Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Device-to-Device (D2D) communication. In this
paper, we show that one can overcome this fundamental limitation when the
number of BS antennas $M$ is sufficiently large. More specifically, we derive a
\textit{scaling law} on the parameters $(M, D_c, K_c, A_c)$ and also
\textit{Signal-to-Noise Ratio} (SNR) under which our proposed AD scheme
succeeds. Our analysis indicates that with a CB of dimension $D_c$, and a
sufficient number of BS antennas $M$ with $A_c/M=o(1)$, one can identify the
activity of $A_c=O(D_c^2/\log^2(\frac{K_c}{A_c}))$ active users, which is much
larger than the previous bound $A_c=O(D_c)$ obtained via traditional compressed
sensing techniques. In particular, in our proposed scheme one needs to pay only
a poly-logarithmic penalty $O(\log^2(\frac{K_c}{A_c}))$ for increasing the
number of potential users $K_c$, which makes it ideally suited for AD in IoT
setups. We propose low-complexity algorithms for AD and provide numerical
simulations to illustrate our results. We also compare the performance of our
proposed AD algorithms with that of other competitive algorithms in the
literature.

that can express a wide range of discrete optimization problems. A VCSP
instance is given by a finite set of variables, a finite domain of labels, and
an objective function to be minimized. This function is represented as a sum of
terms where each term depends on a subset of the variables. To obtain different
classes of optimization problems, one can restrict all terms to come from a
fixed set $\Gamma$ of cost functions, called a language.
  Recent breakthrough results have established a complete complexity
classification of such classes with respect to language $\Gamma$: if all cost
functions in $\Gamma$ satisfy a certain algebraic condition then all
$\Gamma$-instances can be solved in polynomial time, otherwise the problem is
NP-hard. Unfortunately, testing this condition for a given language $\Gamma$ is
known to be NP-hard. We thus study exponential algorithms for this

$poly(\cdot)$ is some fixed polynomial. We also obtain a matching lower bound

microwave background (CMB) data alone results in a significant degeneracy
between the total neutrino mass and several other cosmological parameters,
especially the Hubble constant H_0 and the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$.
Adding low-redshift measurements such as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs)
breaks this degeneracy and greatly improves the constraints on neutrino mass.
The sensitivity is surprisingly high, e.g. adding the $\sim 1$ percent
measurement of the BAO ratio $r_s/D_V$ from the BOSS survey leads to a limit
$\Sigma m_\nu < 0.19$ eV, equivalent to $\Omega_\nu < 0.0045$ at 95\%
confidence. For the case of $\Sigma m_\nu < 0.6$ eV, the CMB degeneracy with
neutrino mass almost follows a track of constant sound horizon angle (Howlett
et al 2012). For a $\Lambda$CDM + $m_\nu$ model, we use simple but quite
accurate analytic approximations to derive the slope of this track, giving
dimensionless multipliers between the neutrino to matter ratio ($x_\nu \equiv
\omega_\nu / \omega_{cb}$) and the shifts in other cosmological parameters. The
resulting multipliers are substantially larger than 1: conserving the CMB sound
horizon angle requires parameter shifts $\delta \ln H_0 \approx -2 \,\delta
x_\nu$, $\delta \ln \Omega_m \approx +5 \, \delta x_\nu$, $\delta \ln
\omega_\Lambda \approx -6.2 \, \delta x_\nu$, and most notably $\delta
\omega_\Lambda \approx -14 \, \delta \omega_\nu$. These multipliers give an
intuitive derivation of the degeneracy direction, which agrees well with the

have different imprints on cluster number counts compared with conformal

analyzed in the framework of the color fields inside the clusters of

the initial temperature is above the universal hadronization temperature and is
consistent with the creation of de-confined matter. In these small systems it

re-generating the friction-induced oscillation and sound of a real writing tool

analyses the frequency spectrum of the friction oscillation generated when
writing with traditional tools, extracts principal frequencies, and uses the
actuator's frequency response profile for an adjustment weighting function. We
enhance the realism by providing the sound feedback aligned with the writing
pressure and speed. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of superposition

methods, determining the top mass parameter of a Monte Carlo event generator,

shower dynamics in Monte Carlo event generators relevant for kinematic
reconstruction, relating $m_t^{\rm MC}$ to field theory masses is a non-trivial
task. In this talk we report on a calibration procedure to determine this
relation using hadron level QCD predictions for 2-Jettiness in $e^+e^-$
annihilation, an observable which has kinematic top mass sensitivity and a
close relation to the invariant mass of the particles coming from the top
decay. The theoretical ingredients of the QCD prediction are reviewed. Fitting
$e^+e^-$ 2-Jettiness calculations at NLL/NNLL order to PYTHIA 8.205, we find
that $m_t^{\rm MC}$ agrees with the MSR mass $m_{t,1\,{\rm GeV}}^{\rm MSR}$
within uncertainties. At NNLL we find $m_t^{\rm MC} = m_{t,1\,{\rm GeV}}^{\rm
MSR} + (0.18 \pm 0.22)\,{\rm GeV}$. $m_t^{\rm MC}$ can differ from the pole
mass $m_t^{\rm pole}$ by up to $600\,{\rm MeV}$, and using the pole mass
generally leads to larger uncertainties. At NNLL we find $m_t^{\rm MC} =
m_t^{\rm pole} + (0.57 \pm 0.28)\,{\rm GeV}$ as the fit result. In contrast,
converting $m_{t,1\,{\rm GeV}}^{\rm MSR}$ obtained at NNLL to the pole mass
gives a result for $m_t^{\rm pole}$ that is substantially larger and
incompatible with the fit result. We also explain some theoretical aspects
relevant for employing the C-parameter as an alternative calibration
observable.

and pattern recognition in handling big data. Deep learning is a powerful
machine learning method that extracts lower level features and feeds them
forward for the next layer to identify higher level features that improve
performance. However, deep neural networks have drawbacks, which include many
hyper-parameters and infinite architectures, opaqueness into results, and
relatively slower convergence on smaller datasets. While traditional machine
learning algorithms can address these drawbacks, they are not typically capable
of the performance levels achieved by deep neural networks. To improve
performance, ensemble methods are used to combine multiple base learners. Super
learning is an ensemble that finds the optimal combination of diverse learning
algorithms. This paper proposes deep super learning as an approach which
achieves log loss and accuracy results competitive to deep neural networks
while employing traditional machine learning algorithms in a hierarchical
structure. The deep super learner is flexible, adaptable, and easy to train
with good performance across different tasks using identical hyper-parameter
values. Using traditional machine learning requires fewer hyper-parameters,
allows transparency into results, and has relatively fast convergence on
smaller datasets. Experimental results show that the deep super learner has
superior performance compared to the individual base learners, single-layer
ensembles, and in some cases deep neural networks. Performance of the deep
super learner may further be improved with task-specific tuning.

associated with a \emph{size}, which provides a way of discussing symmetries at
multiple scales in a network. We are able to demonstrate a number of examples
of networks (graphs) which contain latent symmetry, including a number of real

more frequently in graphs built using preferential attachment, a standard model
of network growth, when compared to non-network like (Erd{\H o}s-R\'enyi)

then they must have the same eigenvector centrality, similar to vertices which
are symmetric in the standard sense. This suggests that the latent symmetries
present in real-networks may serve the same structural and functional purpose
standard symmetries do in these networks. We conclude from these facts and

an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space. If $X$ is a pointed topological space, $\pi_1(X)$
has a natural topology coming from the compact-open topology on the space of
maps $S^1 \to X$. In general the construction does not produce a topological
group because it is possible to create examples where the group multiplication
$\pi_1(X) \times \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X)$ is discontinuous. This failure to
obtain a topological group has been noticed by others, for example Fabel.
However, if we work in the category of compactly generated, weakly Hausdorff
spaces, we may retopologise both the space of maps $S^1 \to X$ and the product
$\pi_1(X) \times \pi_1(X)$ with compactly generated topologies to get that
$\pi_1(X)$ is a group object in this category. Such group objects are known as
$k$-groups.
  Next we construct the Eilenberg-Mac Lane space $K(G,1)$ for any totally
path-disconnected $k$-group $G$. The main point of this paper is to show that,
for such a $G$, $\pi_1(K(G,1))$ is isomorphic to $G$ in the category of
$k$-groups.
  All totally disconnected locally compact groups are $k$-groups and so our
results apply in particular to profinite groups. This answers questions that
have been raised by Sauer.
  We also show that there are Mayer-Vietoris sequences and a Seifert-van Kampen
theorem in this theory.
  The theory requires a careful analysis using model structures and other
homotopical structures on cartesian closed categories as we shall see that no
theory can be comfortably developed in the classical world.

variations of M dwarfs to range from $\sim1$ cm/s to $\sim1$ km/s, depending on
various stellar and activity parameters. We investigate the observed relations
between RVs, stellar activity, and stellar parameters of M dwarfs by analyzing
CARMENES high-resolution visual-channel spectra ($0.5$$-$$1$$\mu$m), which were
taken within the CARMENES RV planet survey during its first $20$ months of
operation. During this time, $287$ of the CARMENES-sample stars were observed
at least five times. From each spectrum we derived a relative RV and a measure
of chromospheric H$\alpha$ emission. In addition, we estimated the chromatic
index (CRX) of each spectrum, which is a measure of the RV wavelength
dependence. Despite having a median number of only $11$ measurements per star,
we show that the RV variations of the stars with RV scatter of $>10$ m/s and a
projected rotation velocity $v \sin{i}>2$ km/s are caused mainly by activity.
We name these stars `active RV-loud stars' and find their occurrence to
increase with spectral type: from $\sim3\%$ for early-type M dwarfs
(M$0.0$$-$$2.5$V) through $\sim30\%$ for mid-type M dwarfs (M$3.0$$-$$5.5$V) to
$>50\%$ for late-type M dwarfs (M$6.0$$-$$9.0$V). Their RV-scatter amplitude is
found to be correlated mainly with $v \sin{i}$. For about half of the stars, we
also find a linear RV$-$CRX anticorrelation, which indicates that their
activity-induced RV scatter is lower at longer wavelengths. For most of them we
can exclude a linear correlation between RV and H$\alpha$ emission. Our results
are in agreement with simulated activity-induced RV variations in M dwarfs. The
RV variations of most active RV-loud M dwarfs are likely to be caused by dark
spots on their surfaces, which move in and out of view as the stars rotate.

extreme star-forming conditions that produce strong nebular UV emission lines

outflowing gas along the sightline to the lensed galaxy. The relative emission
line strengths can be reproduced with a very high-ionization, low-metallicity
starburst with binaries, with the exception of He \ii, which indicates an
additional ionization source is needed. We rule out large contributions from
AGN and shocks to the photoionization budget, suggesting that the emission
features requiring the hardest radiation field likely result from extreme

  We first consider two finite type cases: $B_n$ and $C_n$, completing a

  We then consider gradings arising from $3 \times 3$ skew-symmetric matrices.
We show that the mutation-cyclic matrices give rise to gradings in which all
degrees are positive and have only finitely many associated cluster variables
(excepting one particular case). For the mutation-acyclic matrices, we prove
that all occurring degrees have infinitely many variables.
  We provide a sufficient condition for a graded cluster algebra generated by a
quiver to have infinitely many degrees, based on the presence of a subquiver in
its mutation class. We use this to show that the cluster algebras for (quantum)
coordinate rings of matrices and Grassmannians contain cluster variables of all
degrees in $\mathbb{N}$.
  Next we consider the list (given by Felikson, Shapiro & Tumarkin) of
mutation-finite quivers that do not correspond to triangulations of marked
surfaces. We show that $X_7$ gives rise to only two degrees, both with
infinitely many variables, and that $\widetilde{E}_6$, $\widetilde{E}_7$ and
$\widetilde{E}_8$ give rise to infinitely many variables in some degrees.
  Finally, we study gradings arising from marked surfaces (see Fomin, Shapiro &
Thurston). We adapt a definition by Muller to define the space of valuation
functions on such a surface and prove combinatorially that it is isomorphic to
the space of gradings on the associated cluster algebra. We illustrate this
theory by applying it to the annulus with $n+m$ marked points. We show that the
standard grading is of mixed type. We also give an alternative grading in which
all degrees have infinitely many cluster variables.

intrinsic unconventional superconductivity in a 2D superlattice created by
stacking two graphene sheets with a small twist angle. For angles near
$1.1^\circ$, the first `magic' angle, twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) exhibits
ultra-flat bands near charge neutrality, which lead to correlated insulating
states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping away from these correlated
insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical
temperature $T_c$ up to 1.7 K. The temperature-density phase diagram shows
similarities with that of the cuprates, including superconducting domes.
Moreover, quantum oscillations indicate small Fermi surfaces near the
correlated insulating phase, in analogy with under-doped cuprates. The relative
high $T_c$, given such small Fermi surface (corresponding to a record-low 2D
carrier density of $10^{11} \textrm{cm}^{-2}$ , renders TBG among the strongest
coupling superconductors, in a regime close to the BCS-BEC crossover. These
novel results establish TBG as the first purely carbon-based 2D superconductor

which could lead to insights into the physics of high-$T_c$ superconductors and

disposed with respect to the channel mid-height emerge. Additionally, we show
that an accurate description of the averaged swimming velocity and rotation

based on a fully Eulerian description of the velocity field in both, the fluid
and the elastic domain. Viscous and elastic stresses in the Navier-Stokes
equations are restricted to the corresponding domains by multiplication with
their characteristic functions. To obtain the elastic stress, an additional
Oldroyd-B - like equation is solved. Thermodynamically consistent forces are
derived by energy variation. The convergence of the derived equations to the
traditional sharp interface formulation of fluid-structure interaction is shown
by matched asymptotic analysis. The model is evaluated in a challenging
benchmark scenario of an elastic body traversing a fluid channel. A comparison
to reference values from Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) simulations shows
very good agreement. We highlight some distinct advantages of the new model,
like the avoidance of re-triangulations and the stable inclusion of surface
tension. Further, we demonstrate how simple it is to include contact dynamics
into the model, by simulating a ball bouncing off a wall. We extend this
scenario to include adhesion of the ball, which to our knowledge, cannot be
simulated with any other FSI model. While we have restricted simulations to
fluid-structure interaction, the model is capable to simulate any combination

permit pushing the limit. Simulated and observed clusters can be matched on a
one-to-one basis for direct comparisons provided that clusters are well

random and local-Universe like simulations obtained with differently grouped
observational catalogs of peculiar velocities, this paper shows that the
grouping scheme used to remove non-linear motions in the catalogs that
constrain the simulations affects the quality of the numerical clusters. With a
less aggressive grouping scheme - galaxies still falling onto clusters are
preserved - combined with a bias minimization scheme, the mass of the dark
matter halos, simulacra for 5 local clusters - Virgo, Centaurus, Coma, Hydra
and Perseus - is increased by 39% closing the gap with observational mass
estimates. Simulacra are found on average in 89% of the simulations, an

states, namely dynamically old and dynamically young, which reflect their early
and late formation times, respectively, based on their halo mass assembly.
Brightest galaxies in dynamically young groups have suffered their last major
galaxy merger typically $\sim 2$ Gyr more recently than their counterparts in
dynamically old groups. Furthermore, we study the evolution of velocity
dispersion in these two classes and compare them with the analytic models of
isolated halos. The velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies in high mass,
dynamically young groups increases slowly in time, while the analogous
dispersion in dynamically old high-mass groups is constant. In contrast, the
velocity dispersion of giant galaxies in low mass groups decreases rapidly at
late times. This increasing velocity bias is caused by dynamical friction, and
starts much earlier in the dynamically old groups. The recent {\sc Radio-SAGE}
model of galaxy formation suggests that radio luminosities of central galaxies,
considered to be tracers of AGN activity, are enhanced in halos that assembled
more recently, independent of the time since the last major merger.

by sub-wavelength fluctuations within the host material, that may be frozen-in
or even dynamically induced. The most common manifestation of such
sub-wavelength disorder is Rayleigh light scattering, which is observed in
nearly all wave-guiding technologies today and can lead to both irreversible
radiative losses as well as undesirable intermodal coupling. While it has been
shown that backscattering from disorder can be suppressed by breaking
time-reversal symmetry in magneto-optic and topological insulator materials,
common optical dielectrics possess neither of these properties. Here we
demonstrate an optomechanical approach for dynamically suppressing Rayleigh
backscattering within dielectric resonators. We achieve this by locally
breaking time-reversal symmetry in a silica resonator through a Brillouin
scattering interaction that is available in all materials. Near-complete
suppression of Rayleigh backscattering is experimentally confirmed through
three independent measurements -- the reduction of the back-reflections caused
by scatterers, the elimination of a commonly seen normal-mode splitting effect,
and by measurement of the reduction in intrinsic optical loss. More broadly,
our results provide new evidence that it is possible to dynamically suppress
Rayleigh backscattering within any optical dielectric medium, for achieving
robust light propagation in nanophotonic devices in spite of the presence of
scatterers or defects.

separations $< {\rm few}\times 10^4\, r_g$ ($r_g = GM/c^2$ and $M$ is the
binary mass), and for every one SBHB in this range there should be over 200
more gravitationally bound systems with similar properties, at larger
separations. Furthermore, if spectra of all SBHBs in this separation range
exhibit the AGN-like emission lines utilized by spectroscopic searches, the
projection factors imply five undetected binaries for each observed
$10^8M_\odot$ SBHB with mass ratio $0.3$ and orbital separation $10^4\,r_g$
(and more if some fraction of SBHBs is inactive). This model can be used to
infer the most likely orbital parameters for observed SBHB candidates and to
provide constraints on the rate of orbital evolution of SBHBs, if observed
candidates are shown to be genuine binaries.

the Virgo cluster can be obtained via simulations that resemble the local
Universe down to the cluster scale. In such simulations, Virgo-like halos form
in the proper local environment and permit assessing the most probable
formation history of the cluster. Studies based on these simulations have
already revealed that the Virgo cluster has had a quiet merging history over
the last seven gigayears and that the cluster accretes matter along a
preferential direction. This paper reveals that in addition such Virgo halos
have had on average only one merger larger than about a tenth of their mass at
redshift zero within the last four gigayears. This second branch (by opposition
to main branch) formed in a given sub-region and merged recently (within the

from an ultra-violet process into the infra-red is a fundamental concern for
asymptotically free or conformal gauge field theories. It is also a practical
concern for any high energy scattering experiment with energies above tens of
GeV. We present a formulation of the evolution equation that governs this
cascade, the Banfi-Marchesini-Smye equation, from both an effective field
theory point of view and a direct diagrammatic argument. The equation uses
exact momentum conservation, and is applicable to both scattering with initial
and final state hard partons. The direct diagrammatic formulation is organized
by constructing a generating functional. This functional is also automatically
realized with soft wilson lines and collinear field operators coupled to
external currents. The two approaches are directly connected by reverse
engineering the Lehman-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction procedure to insert states
within the soft and collinear matrix elements. At leading order, the cascade is
completely controlled by the soft anomalous dimension. By decomposing the
anomalous dimension into on-shell and off-shell regions as would be realized in
the effective field theory approach with a Glauber mediating potential, we are
forced to choose a transverse momentum ordering in order to trivialize the
overlap between Glauber potential contributions and the pure soft region. The
evolution equation then naturally incorporates factorization violating effects
driven by off-shell exchanges for active partons. Finally, we examine the
consequences of abandoning exact momentum conservation as well as terminating
the evolution at the largest inclusive scale, procedures often used to simplify
the analysis of the cascade.

measures are unable to robustly pick out galaxies currently undergoing mergers
during Cosmic Noon, typically performing no better than a random guess. This
improves only marginally if we consider whether galaxies have undergone a
merger within the last Gyr. When also considering minor mergers, galaxies
display no trend of moving towards the merger regime with increasing merger
ratio. From z = 4 -> 2, galaxies move from the non-merger towards the merger
regime in all statistics, but this is primarily an effect of mass: Above a
given noise level, higher mass galaxies display a more complex outer morphology
induced by their clustered environment. We conclude that during Cosmic Noon,
these morphological statistics are of limited value in identifying galaxy
mergers.

galaxies not associated with the central supermassive black hole. Their
luminosities imply they are powered by either an extreme accretion rate onto a
compact stellar remnant, or an intermediate mass ($\sim100-10^5$ M$_{\odot}$)
black hole. The recent detection of coherent pulsations coming from three
bright ULXs demonstrates that some of these sources are powered by accretion
onto a neutron star, implying accretion rates significantly in excess of the
Eddington limit, a high degree of geometric beaming, or both. The physical
challenges associated with the high implied accretion rates can be mitigated if
the neutron star surface field is high - in the magnetar regime ($10^{14}$ G),
since this suppresses the electron scattering cross section, reducing the
radiation pressure that chokes off accretion for high luminosities. One of the
few ways to determine surface magnetic fields is through the detection of
cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs) produced by the transition of
charged particles between quantized Landau levels. To date, CRSFs have only
been detected in Galactic accreting pulsars. Here we present the detection at
3.8-{\sigma} significance of a strong absorption line at a rest-frame energy of
4.5 keV in the Chandra spectrum of a ULX in M51. We find that this feature is
likely to be a CRSF produced by the strong magnetic field of a neutron star.
Assuming scattering off electrons, the magnetic field strength is implied to be
$\sim10^{11}$ G, however the line is narrower than any electron CRSFs
previously observed, and assuming thermal broadening, the implied temperature
is significantly cooler than the accretion disk or column. The line shape is,
however, consistent with a proton resonance scattering feature, implying that
the neutron star has a magnetic field near the surface of B$\sim10^{15}$ G.

through Roche-lobe overflow. They bear astrophysical significance as sources of
UV and ionizing radiation in older stellar populations and, if sufficiently
massive, as stripped supernova progenitors. Binary evolutionary models predict
them to be common, but only a handful of subdwarfs (i.e., SESs) with B-type
companions are known. This could be the result of observational biases
hindering detection, or an incorrect understanding of binary evolution. We
reanalyze the well-studied post-interaction binary phi Persei. Recently, new
data improved the orbital solution of the system, which contains a ~1.2 Msun
SES and a rapidly rotating ~9.6 Msun Be star. We compare with an extensive grid
of evolutionary models using a Bayesian approach and find initial masses of the
progenitor of 7.2+/-0.4 Msun for the SES and 3.8+/-0.4 Msun for the Be star.
The system must have evolved through near-conservative mass transfer. These
findings are consistent with earlier studies. The age we obtain, 57+/-9 Myr, is
in excellent agreement with the age of the alpha Persei cluster. We note that
neither star was initially massive enough to produce a core-collapse supernova,
but mass exchange pushed the Be star above the mass threshold. We find that the
subdwarf is overluminous for its mass by almost an order of magnitude, compared
to the expectations for a helium core burning star. We can only reconcile this
if the subdwarf is in a late phase of helium shell burning, which lasts only
2-3% of the total lifetime as a subdwarf. This could imply that up to ~50 less
evolved, dimmer subdwarfs exist for each system similar to phi Persei. Our
findings can be interpreted as a strong indication that a substantial
population of SESs indeed exists, but has so far evaded detection because of
observational biases and lack of large-scale systematic searches.

that if first-(1G) and second-generation (2G) stars have the same initial MF

dynamical evolution and no significant differences between the 1G and the 2G
MFs arise during the cluster's evolution. If the two populations have different
IMFs, dynamical effects do not completely erase memory of the initial
differences. Should observations find differences between the global 1G and 2G

Irrespective of whether the 1G and 2G populations have the same global IMF or
not, dynamical effects can produce differences between the local (measured at
various distances from the cluster centre) 1G and 2G MFs; these differences are
a manifestation of the process of mass segregation in populations with
different initial structural properties. In dynamically old and spatially mixed
clusters, however, differences between the local 1G and 2G MFs can reveal
differences between the 1G and 2G global MFs. In general, for clusters with any
dynamical age, large differences between the local 1G and 2G MFs are more
likely to be associated with differences in the global MF. Our study also
reveals a dependence of the spatial mixing rate on the stellar mass, another

high-temperature superconductors to very diluted superconductors. While several
properties of multi-band superconductors can be understood as straightforward
generalizations of their single-band counterparts, recent works have unveiled
rather unusual behaviors unique to the former case. In this regard, a regime
that has received significant attention is that near a Lifshitz transition, in
which one of the bands crosses the Fermi level. In this work, we investigate
how impurity scattering $\tau^{-1}$ affects the superconducting transition
temperature $T_{c}$ across a Lifshitz transition, in the regime where
intra-band pairing is dominant and inter-band pairing is subleading. This is
accomplished by deriving analytic asymptotic expressions for $T_{c}$ and
$\partial T_{c}/\partial\tau^{-1}$ in a two-dimensional two-band system. When
the inter-band pairing interaction is repulsive, we find that, despite the
incipient nature of the band crossing the Fermi level, inter-band impurity
scattering is extremely effective in breaking Cooper pairs, making $\partial
T_{c}/\partial\tau^{-1}$ quickly approach the limiting Abrikosov-Gor'kov value
of the high-density regime. In contrast, when the inter-band pairing
interaction is attractive, pair-breaking is much less efficient, affecting
$T_{c}$ only mildly at the vicinity of the Lifshitz transition. The consequence
of this general result is that the behavior of $T_{c}$ across a Lifshitz
transition can be qualitatively changed in the presence of strong enough
disorder: instead of displaying a sharp increase across the Lifshitz
transition, as in the clean case, $T_{c}$ can actually display a maximum and be
suppressed at the Lifshitz transition. These results shed new light on the
non-trivial role of impurity scattering in multi-band superconductors.

empirical benchmarks to test models of structure formation on small scales. The
nearby Centaurus group, with its two subgroups centered on CenA and M83, stands
out as an important alternative to the Local Group for scrutinizing
cosmological model predictions in a group of galaxies context. We have obtained
deep optical images of three recently discovered M83 satellite galaxy
candidates with the FORS2 instrument mounted on the Very Large Telescope. We
aim to confirm their group membership and study their stellar population. Deep
VI-band photometry is used to resolve the brightest stars in our targets.
Artificial star tests are performed to estimate the completeness and
uncertainties of the photometry. The color-magnitude diagrams reveal the red
giant branch (RGB) stars allowing to use the Sobel edge detection method to
measure the magnitude of the RGB tip and thus derive distances and group
membership for our targets. The mean metallicity of the dwarf galaxies are
further determined by fitting BASTI model isochrones to the mean RGB locus. We
confirm the two candidates, dw1335-29 and dw1340-30, to be dwarf satellites of
the M83 subgroup, with estimated distances of 5.03 +- 0.24 Mpc and 5.06 +- 0.24
Mpc, respectively. Their respective mean metallicities of <[Fe/H]> = -1.79 +-
0.4 and <[Fe/H]> = -2.27 +- 0.4 are consistent with the metallicity-luminosity
relation for dwarf galaxies. The third candidate, dw1325-33, could not be
resolved into stars due to insufficiently deep images, implying its distance
must be larger than 5.3 Mpc. Using the two newly derived distances we assess
the spatial distribution of the galaxies in the M83 subgroup and discuss a
potential plane-ofsatellites around M83.

matching problem: given an instance of a classical optimization problem and a
low energy state, find another macroscopically distinct low energy state.
Energy matching is difficult in rugged optimization landscapes, as the given
state provides little information about the distant topography. Here we show
that the introduction of quantum dynamics can provide a speed-up over local
classical algorithms in a large class of hard optimization problems. The
essential intuition is that tunneling allows the system to explore the
optimization landscape while approximately conserving the classical energy,
even in the presence of large barriers. In particular, we study energy matching
in the random p-spin model of spin glass theory. Using perturbation theory and
numerical exact diagonalization, we show that introducing a transverse field
leads to three sharp dynamical phases, only one of which solves the matching
problem: (1) a small-field trapped phase, in which tunneling is too weak for
the system to escape the vicinity of the initial state; (2) a large-field
excited phase, in which the field excites the system into high energy states,
effectively forgetting the initial low energy; and (3) the intermediate
tunneling phase, in which the system succeeds at energy matching. We find that
in the tunneling phase, the time required to find distant states scales
exponentially with system size but is nevertheless exponentially faster than
simple classical Monte Carlo.

  achieving a Newton-like convergence","35 pages, 6 figures",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we introduce a new gradient method which attains quadratic
convergence in a certain sense. Applicable to infinite-dimensional
unconstrained minimization problems posed in a Hilbert space $H$, the approach
consists in finding the energy gradient $g(\lambda)$ defined with respect to an
optimal inner product selected from an infinite family of equivalent inner
products $(\cdot,\cdot)_\lambda$ in the space $H$. The inner products are
parameterized by a space-dependent weight function $\lambda$. At each iteration
of the method, where an approximation to the minimizer is given by an element
$u\in H$, an optimal weight $\hlambda$ is found as a solution of a nonlinear
minimization problem in the space of weights $\Lambda$. It turns out that the
projection of $\kappa g(\hlambda)$, where $0<\kappa \ll 1$ is a fixed step
size, onto a certain finite-dimensional subspace generated by the method is
consistent with Newton's step $h$, in the sense that $P_u(\kappa
g(\hlambda))=P_u(h)$, where $P_u$ is an operator describing the projection onto
the subspace. As demonstrated by rigorous analysis, this property ensures that
thus constructed gradient method attains quadratic convergence for error
components contained in these subspaces, in addition to the linear convergence
typical of the standard gradient method. We propose a numerical implementation
of this new approach and analyze its complexity. Computational results obtained
based on a simple model problem confirm the theoretically established
convergence properties, demonstrating that the proposed approach performs much
better than the standard steepest-descent method based on Sobolev gradients.
The presented results offer an explanation of a number of earlier empirical

D^{swim}$ to the container boundaries, where $\zeta$ is the drag coefficient,
$D^{swim}$ is the swim diffusivity and $n$ is the uniform bulk number density
far from the container walls. In this work we extend the notion of the
isotropic swim pressure to the anisotropic tensorial swim stress
$\mathbf{\sigma}^{swim} = - n \zeta \mathbf{D}^{swim}$, which is related to the
anisotropic swim diffusivity $\mathbf{D}^{swim}$. We demonstrate this
relationship with ABPs that achieve nematic orientational order via a bulk
external field. The anisotropic swim stress is obtained analytically for dilute
ABPs in both 2D and 3D systems, and the anisotropy is shown to grow
exponentially with the strength of the external field. We verify that the
normal component of the anisotropic swim stress applies a pressure
$\Pi^{swim}=-(\mathbf{\sigma}^{swim}\cdot\mathbf{n})\cdot\mathbf{n}$ on a wall
with normal vector $\mathbf{n}$, and, through Brownian dynamics simulations,
this pressure is shown to be the force per unit area transmitted by the active
particles. Since ABPs have no friction with a wall, the difference between the
normal and tangential stress components -- the normal stress difference --
generates a net flow of ABPs along the wall, which is a generic property of
active matter systems.

inner rim to be at 12.3+/-0.4 au from the central star. We determined an upper
mass limit of 0.34 Msun for a companion inside the cavity. Within the cavity,
the near-infrared emission, usually associated with the dust sublimation
region, is unusually extended (~10 au, 30 times larger than the theoretical
sublimation radius) and indicates a high dust temperature (T~1800 K). As a
possible result of companion-induced dust segregation, quantum heated dust
grains could explain the extended near-infrared emission with this high

sample? How should the network be sampled, and what effect does it have on
inference error? How does the structure of the network impact the sampling
strategy? We address these questions by systematically examining how network
sampling strategy and sample size affect accuracy of relational inference in
networks. To this end, we generate a family of synthetic networks where nodes
have a binary attribute and a tunable level of homophily. As expected, we find
that in heterophilic networks, we can obtain good accuracy when only small

sampling strategies that work well in heterophilic networks lead to large

doublets to the Stokeslet above a flat wall, the no-slip boundary condition can
be conveniently imposed on the wall [Blake, J. R. Math. Proc. Camb. Philos.
Soc. 70(2), 1971: 303.]. However, to further impose periodic boundary
conditions on directions parallel to the wall usually involves tedious
derivations because single or double periodicity in Stokes flow may require the
periodic unit to have no net force, which is not satisfied by the well-known
image system. In this work we present a force-neutral image system. This
neutrality allows us to represent the Stokes image system in a universal
formulation for non-periodic, singly periodic and doubly periodic geometries.
This formulation enables the black-box style usage of fast kernel summation
methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this new image method
with the periodic kernel independent fast multipole method in both non-periodic
and doubly periodic geometries. We then extend this new image system to other
widely used Stokes fundamental solutions, including the Laplacian of the
Stokeslet and the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor.

out of the waveguide. The photon correlations arise due to an interplay of
nonlinearity and coupling to a loss reservoir, which creates a strong effective
interaction between transmitted photons. The highly correlated photon states
are less susceptible to losses than uncorrelated photons and have a power-law
decay with $N$. This is described using a simple universal asymptotic solution
governed by a single scaling parameter which describes photon bunching and
power transmission. We show numerically that, for randomly placed emitters,
these results hold even in systems without chirality. The effect can be
observed in existing tapered fiber setups with trapped atoms.

analysts have become able to extract useful information from them. To this end,
the concept of ""driving volatility"" is defined and explored as deviation from
the norm. Several measures of dispersion and variation can be computed in
different ways using vehicles' instantaneous speed, acceleration, and jerk
observed at intersections. This study explores different measures of
volatility, representing newly available surrogate measures of safety, by
combining data from the Michigan Safety Pilot Deployment of connected vehicles
with crash and inventory data at several intersections. The intersection data
was error-checked and verified for accuracy. Then, for each intersection, 37
different measures of volatility were calculated. These volatilities were then
used to explain crash frequencies at intersection by estimating fixed and
random parameter Poisson regression models. Results show that an increase in
three measures of driving volatility are positively associated with higher
intersection crash frequency, controlling for exposure variables and geometric
features. More intersection crashes were associated with higher percentages of
vehicle data points (speed & acceleration) lying beyond threshold-bands. These
bands were created using mean plus two standard deviations. Furthermore, a
higher magnitude of time-varying stochastic volatility of vehicle speeds when
they pass through the intersection is associated with higher crash frequencies.
These measures can be used to locate intersections with high driving
volatilities, i.e., hot-spots where crashes are waiting to happen. Therefore, a
deeper analysis of these intersections can be undertaken and proactive safety
countermeasures considered at high volatility locations to enhance safety.

of the epoch of reionization and galaxy formation. Its popularity stems from
its ability to drastically reduce the computing cost of a simulation, by
allowing the use of larger, and therefore fewer timesteps to reach a solution.
It is physically motivated by the fact that ionization fronts rarely propagate
faster than some fraction of the speed of light. However, no global proof of
the physical validity of this approach is available, and possible artefacts
resulting from this approximation therefore need to be identifited and
characterized to allow its proper use. In this paper we investigate the impact
of the reduced speed of light approximation on the predicted properties of the
intergalactic medium. To this end we use fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics
RAMSES-CUDATON simulations of the epoch of reionization. We find that reducing
the speed of light by a factor 5 (20, 100) leads to overestimating the
post-reionization volume-weighted $x_{HI}$ by a similar factor ~5 (20, 100)
with respect to full speed of light simulations. We show that the error is
driven by the hydrogen - photon chemistry. In photo-ionization equilibrium,
reducing the speed of light has the same effect as artificially reducing the
photon density or the reaction cross-section and leads to an underestimated
ionizing flux. We confirm this interpretation by running additional simulations
using a reduced speed of light in the photon propagation module, but keeping
this time the full speed of light in the chemistry module. With this setup, the
post-reionization neutral hydrogen fractions converge to the full speed of
light value, which validates our explanation. Increasing spatial resolution
beyond a cell size of 1 kpc physical, so as to better resolve Lyman-limit
systems, does not significantly affect our conclusions.

sample size. We apply the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to IFs to understand
their scale-dependent behavior. For a journal of $n$ randomly selected papers
from a population of all papers, we expect from the CLT that its IF fluctuates
around the population average $\mu$, and spans a range of values proportional
to $\sigma/\sqrt[]{n}$, where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the population's
citation distribution. The $1/\sqrt[]{n}$ dependence has profound implications
for IF rankings: The larger a journal, the narrower the range around $\mu$
where its IF lies. IF rankings therefore allocate an unfair advantage to
smaller journals in the high IF ranks, and to larger journals in the low IF
ranks. We expect a scale-dependent stratification of journals in IF rankings,
whereby small journals occupy top, middle, and bottom ranks; mid-sized journals
occupy middle ranks; and very large journals have IFs that asymptotically
approach $\mu$. We confirm these predictions by analyzing (i) 166,498 IF \&
journal-size data pairs in the 1997--2016 Journal Citation Reports of Clarivate
Analytics, (ii) the top-cited portion of 276,000 physics papers published in
2014--2015, and (iii) the citation distributions of an arbitrarily sampled list
of physics journals. We conclude that the CLT is a good predictor of the IF
range of actual journals, while sustained deviations from its predictions are a
mark of true, non-random, citation impact. IF rankings are thus misleading
unless one compares like-sized journals or adjusts for these effects. We
propose the $\Phi$ index, a rescaled IF adjusted for size, which can be
generalized to account also for different citation practices across research
fields. Our methodology applies also to citation averages used to compare
research fields, university departments or countries in various rankings.

capture non-Markovian (history-dependent) behaviors that occur in real systems.
These methods model a quantum process as a fixed map on the state space of a
predefined system of interest. Such a map averages over the system's
environment, which may retain some effect of its past interactions with the
system and thus have a history-dependent influence on the system. Although the
theory of non-Markovian quantum dynamics is currently an active area of
research, a systematic characterization method based on a general
representation of non-Markovian dynamics has been lacking.
  In this article we present a systematic method for experimentally
characterizing the dynamics of open quantum systems. Our method, which we call
quantum process identification (QPI), is based on a general theoretical
framework which relates the (non-Markovian) evolution of a system over an
extended period of time to a time-local (Markovian) process involving the
system and an effective environment. In practical terms, QPI uses time-resolved
tomographic measurements of a quantum system to construct a dynamical model
with as many dynamical variables as are necessary to reproduce the evolution of
the system. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that QPI can be used
to characterize qubit operations with non-Markovian errors arising from
realistic dynamics including control drift, coherent leakage, and coherent
interaction with material impurities.

Comparison of the system with a 5% vacancy concentration with pure lattice data
shows a decrease in frequency as well as a decrease in lifetime for all

line shape for low-q spin waves indicates the presence of multiple localized
excitations near defect sites resulting in reduced excitation lifetimes due to
increased magnon-magnon scattering. We observe further evidence of increased

late-Universe solutions to the $H_0$, Ly-$\alpha$, and $S_8$ discrepancies.
When considered on their own, massive neutrinos provide a natural solution to
the $S_8$ discrepancy at the expense of increasing the $H_0$ tension. If all
extensions are considered simultaneously, the best-fit solution has a neutrino
mass sum of $\sim 0.4$ eV, a dark energy equation of state close to that of a
cosmological constant, and no additional relativistic degrees of freedom.
However, the $H_0$ tension, while weakened, remains unresolved. Motivated by
this result, we perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the evolution of the
dark energy fluid density (allowing for negative energy densities), together
with massive neutrinos. When all datasets are included, there exists a residual
$\sim1.9\sigma$ tension with $H_0$. If this residual tension remains in the
future, it will indicate that it is not possible to solve the $H_0$ tension
solely with a modification of the late-Universe dynamics within standard
general relativity. However, we do find that it is possible to resolve the
tension if either galaxy BAO or JLA supernovae data are omitted. We find that
\textit{negative} dark energy densities are favored near redshift $z\sim2.35$
when including the Ly-$\alpha$ BAO measurement (at $\sim 2\sigma$). This
behavior may point to a negative curvature, but it is most likely indicative of
systematics or at least an underestimated covariance matrix. Quite remarkably,
we find that in the extended cosmologies considered in this work, the neutrino
mass sum is always close to $0.4$ eV regardless of the choice of external
datasets, as long as the $H_0$ tension is solved or significantly decreased.

depend on galaxy evolution parameters of the HI and the optical sample.
Previously, we have shown that the shot noise of the cross-correlation scales
with the HI content of the optical samples, such that the shot noise estimation
infers the average HI masses of these samples. In this article, we present an
adaptive framework for the cross-correlation of HI intensity maps with galaxy
samples using our implementation of the halo model formalism (Murray et al
2018, in prep) which utilises the halo occupation distribution of galaxies to
predict their power spectra. We compare two HI population models, tracing the
spatial halo and the galaxy distribution respectively, and present their auto-
and cross-power spectra with an associated galaxy sample. We find that the
choice of the HI model and the distribution of the HI within the galaxy sample
have minor significance for the shape of the auto- and cross-correlations, but
highly impact the measured shot noise amplitude of the estimators, a finding we
confirm with simulations. We demonstrate parameter estimation of the HI halo
occupation models and advocate this framework for the interpretation of future
experimental data, with the prospect of determining the HI masses of optical
galaxy samples via the cross-correlation shot noise.

arcmin^2. The polarimetric observations are carried out by modulating the
incoming light through different steps of half-wave plate angles 0, 22.5, 45,
67.5 deg, to establish linear Stokes parameters (I, Q, and U). Image reduction
consists of dark subtraction, polarimetric flat fielding, and sky subtraction.
The astrometry and photometric calibrations are performed using the publicly

yielded an instrumental polarization of 0.51%. Uncertainties in polarization
range from 0.1% to 10% from the brightest 7 mag to faintest 16 mag stars. The
polarimetric accuracy achieved is better than 0.5% and the position angle
errors less than 5 deg for stars brighter than 13 mag in H-band. POLICAN is

measured for pressures up to 9.1 GPa were used as input data to simulate the
partial and total structure factors SBiBi, SBiTe, STeTe, and SBi2Te3. Fourier

coordination shells of these Gij functions are formed by subshells and, with
increasing pressure in the 1.1 to 6.3 GPa range, occur a partial separation of
subshells. Also, the increase of pressure in this range promotes a drastic
reduction in the values of the intralayer angles TeBiTe, and consequently, in
the intralayer distance TeTe. A drastic reduction in the interlayers distance
Te-Te was also observed. Several studies are reported in the literature,
including one carried out by us, show the presence of an ETT in this pressure

of the intralayer angles TeBiTe, and intra- and interlayer distance TeTe.
Experimental results describing the pressure dependence the thermoelectric
power, electrical resistivity, and power fator for rhombohedral Bi2Te3 are
reported, and an enhancement of the power factor in the 1.1 to 6.3 GPa range is
observed. The results obtained in this study give evidence that this
enhancement in the power factor is related with the decrease of the intralayer
angles TeBiTe, and with the decrease of intralayer- and interlayers homopolar
TeTe bonds.

discretization of partial differential equations is crucial to the performance
of many physics-based simulations. The algorithmic optimality of multilevel
approaches for common discretizations makes them a good candidate for an
efficient parallel solver. Yet, modern architectures for high-performance
computing systems continue to challenge the parallel scalability of multilevel
solvers. While algebraic multigrid methods are robust for solving a variety of
problems, the increasing importance of data locality and cost of data movement
in modern architectures motivates the need to carefully exploit structure in
the problem.
  Robust logically structured variational multigrid methods, such as Black Box
Multigrid (BoxMG), maintain structure throughout the multigrid hierarchy. This
avoids indirection and increased coarse-grid communication costs typical in
parallel algebraic multigrid. Nevertheless, the parallel scalability of
structured multigrid is challenged by coarse-grid problems where the overhead
in communication dominates computation. In this paper, an algorithm is
introduced for redistributing coarse-grid problems through incremental
agglomeration. Guided by a predictive performance model, this algorithm
provides robust redistribution decisions for structured multilevel solvers.
  A two-dimensional diffusion problem is used to demonstrate the significant
gain in performance of this algorithm over the previous approach that used
agglomeration to one processor. In addition, the parallel scalability of this
approach is demonstrated on two large-scale computing systems, with solves on
up to 500K+ cores.

identifying the best predictors of the nuclear radio activity. While confirming
the established result that stellar mass must play a key role in the triggering
of radio activities, we point out that for central, most massive galaxies, the
radio activity also shows a strong dependence on halo mass, which is unlikely
due to enhanced interaction rates in denser regions in massive, cluster-scale
halos. We thus further investigate the effects of various properties of the
intracluster medium (ICM) in massive clusters on the radio activities,
employing two standard statistical tools, Principle Component Analysis and
Logistic Regression. It is found that ICM entropy, local cooling time, and
pressure are the most effective in predicting the radio activity, pointing to
the accretion of gas cooling out of a hot atmosphere to be the likely origin in
triggering such activities in galaxies residing in massive dark matter halos.

general metric admitting the principal tensor (a non-degenerate closed
conformal Killing-Yano 2-form). To this purpose we use a special ansatz for the
electromagnetic potential, which we represent as a product of a (rank 2)
polarization tensor with the gradient of a potential function, generalizing the
ansatz recently proposed by Lunin. We show that for a special choice of the
polarization tensor written in terms of the principal tensor, both the Lorenz
gauge condition and the Maxwell equations reduce to a composition of mutually
commuting operators acting on the potential function. A solution to both these
equations can be written in terms of an eigenfunction of these commuting
operators. When incorporating a multiplicative separability ansatz, it turns
out that the eigenvalue equations reduce to a set of separated ordinary
differential equations with the eigenvalues playing a role of separability
constants. The remaining ambiguity in the separated equations is related to an
identification of D-2 polarizations of the electromagnetic field. We thus
obtained a sufficiently rich set of solutions for the Maxwell equations in

reformulate the problem exploiting its inf-conv structure and derive a block

Our framework includes various existing algorithms as special cases, such as
DC-programming, $k$-means clustering and ADMM with nonlinear operator, when a
specific objective function and inf-conv decomposition (inf-deconvolution) is

asymptotically normal as the number of vertices increases to infinity. We also
provide confidence intervals for quantifying the uncertainty in these estimates

is a critical technique in providing vertical connections. However, the yield
and reliability is one of the key obstacles to adopt the TSV based 3D-ICs
technology in industry. Various fault-tolerance structures using spare TSVs to
repair faulty functional TSVs have been proposed in literature for yield and
reliability enhancement, but a valid structure cannot always be found due to
the lack of effective generation methods for fault-tolerance structures. In
this paper, we focus on the problem of adaptive fault-tolerance structure
generation. Given the relations between functional TSVs and spare TSVs, we
first calculate the maximum number of tolerant faults in each TSV group. Then
we propose an integer linear programming (ILP) based model to construct
adaptive fault-tolerance struc- ture with minimal multiplexer delay overhead
and hardware cost. We further develop a speed-up technique through efficient
min-cost-max-flow (MCMF) model. All the proposed method- ologies are embedded

adaptive fault- tolerance structures. Experimental results show that, compared

we probe the possibility of $T-S$ criticality in both the canonical ensemble

the phantom AdS black hole in the canonical ensemble, which is different from
the RN-AdS black hole. Contrary to the canonical ensemble, no critical point
can be found for neither phantom AdS black holes nor RN-AdS black hole in the
grand-canonical ensemble. Moreover, we study the specific heat at constant
electric potential. When the electric potential satisfies $A_0>1$, only phantom
AdS black holes undergo phase transition in the grand-canonical ensemble. In
the extended phase space, we show that there is no $P-V$ criticality for
phantom AdS black holes, contrary to the case of the RN-AdS black hole.
Furthermore, we define a new kind of heat engine via phantom AdS black holes.
Comparing to RN-AdS black holes, phantom AdS black holes have a lower heat
engine efficiency. However, the ratio $\eta/\eta_C$ of phantom AdS black hole
is higher, thus increasing the possibility of approaching the Carnot limit.
This observation is obviously of interest. The interesting results obtained in
this paper may be attributed to the existence of phantom field whose energy
density is negative.

nonconvexity, discrete homotopy classes, and control switching cause
discontinuity in the parameter-solution mapping, thus making learning difficult
for traditional continuous function approximators. A mixture of experts (MoE)

such an issue. The optimal trajectories of different parameters are clustered
such that in each cluster the trajectories are continuous function of problem

classifier and regressors individually outperforms joint training of MoE. With
suitably chosen clusters, this approach not only achieves lower prediction
error with less training data and fewer model parameters, but also leads to
dramatic improvements in the reliability of trajectory tracking compared to
traditional universal function approximation models (e.g., neural networks).

chemistry of H$_2$ and H$_3^+$ in protoplanetary disks. Multiple paths of
deuterium fractionation are found; exchange reactions with D atoms, such as
HCO$^+$ + D, are effective in addition to those with HD. In a disk model with
grain sizes appropriate for dark clouds, the freeze-out of molecules is severe
in the outer midplane, while the disk surface is shielded from UV radiation.
Gaseous molecules, including DCO$^+$, thus become abundant at the disk surface,
which tends to make their column density distribution relatively flat. If the
dust grains have grown to millimeter size, the freeze-out rate of neutral
species is reduced, and the abundances of gaseous molecules, including DCO$^+$
and N$_2$D$^+$, are enhanced in the cold midplane. Turbulent diffusion
transports D atoms and radicals at the disk surface to the midplane, and stable
ice species in the midplane to the disk surface. The effects of turbulence on
chemistry are thus multifold; while DCO$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ abundances increase
or decrease depending on the regions, HCN and DCN in the gas and ice are much
reduced at the innermost radii, compared with the model without turbulence.
When cosmic rays penetrate the disk, the ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of H$_2$ is
found to be thermal in the disk, except in the cold ($\lesssim 10$ K) midplane.
We also analyze the OPR of H$_3^+$ and H$_2$D$^+$, as well as the main
reactions of H$_2$D$^+$, DCO$^+$, and N$_2$D$^+$ to analytically derive their
abundances in the cold midplane.

flaring active regions, we extracted time series from multiple distinct
positions, including the flare core and quieter surrounding areas. The time
series were analyzed with a moving power map analysis to examine power as a
function of frequency and time. We find that, in the flare core of all three

immediately prior to and after the flare, and that power at all frequencies up
to 8 mHz is depleted at flare maximum. This depletion is both frequency and
time dependent, which probably reflects the changing depths visible during the
flare in the bandpass of the filter. These variations are not observed outside
the flare cores. The depletion may indicate that acoustic energy is being
converted into thermal energy at flare maximum, while the low-frequency
enhancement may arise from an instability in the chromosphere and provide an
early warning of the flare onset. Dark lanes of reduced wave power are also
visible in the power maps, which may arise from the interaction of the acoustic

this turns out to depend not only on the specified conditions in the bulk
electrolyte solution (e.g., fixed volume or fixed pressure), but also on the
specified surface conditions, such as fixed surface charge or fixed surface

potential can be solved analytically for planar or wall geometry, and we
present analytic solutions for both a full electrolyte, and for an ionic
solution which contains only counterions, i.e. ions of sign opposite to that of
the wall charge. This latter case has some novel features. We also use the free

orientational phases of quantum dipolar rotors whose properties are determined
by the ratios between the strength anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction, the

found to show a transition to a phase characterized by net polarization in the

direct laser acceleration assisted by the self-generated quasi-static electric

responses lead to measurable changes in Maxwell's equations due to the
quantum-matter-mediated photon-photon interactions. Key features of treating
the combined matter-photon response are that natural lifetimes of excitations
become directly accessible from first principles, changes in the electronic
structure due to strong light-matter coupling are treated fully
non-perturbatively, and for the first time self-consistent solutions of the
back-reaction of matter onto the photon vacuum and vice versa are accounted
for. By introducing a straightforward extension of the random-phase

ab-initio spectra for a real molecular system that is coupled to the quantized

composition, extracted from the observed distributions of the depth of shower
maximum $X_\text{max}$, is dominated by uncertainties in the hadronic
interaction models. Thus, the estimated composition depends strongly on the
particular model used for its interpretation. To reduce this model dependency
in the interpretation of the mass composition, we have developed a novel
approach which allows the adjustment of the normalisation levels of the proton
$<X_\text{max}>$ and $\sigma (X_\text{max})$ guided by real observations of
$X_\text{max}$ distributions. In this paper we describe the details of this
approach and present a study of its performance and its limitations. Using this
approach we extracted cosmic ray mass composition information from the
published Pierre Auger $X_\text{max}$ distributions. We have obtained a
consistent mass composition interpretation for Epos-LHC, QGSJetII-04 and
Sibyll2.3. Our fits suggest a composition consisting of predominantly iron.
Below $10^{18.8}$ eV, the small proportions of proton, helium and nitrogen
vary. Above $10^{18.8}$ eV, there is little proton or helium, and with
increasing energy the nitrogen component gradually gives way to the growing
iron component, which dominates at the highest energies. The fits suggest that
the normalisation level for proton $<X_\mathrm{max}>$ is much deeper than the
initial predictions of the hadronic interaction models. The fitted
normalisation level for proton $\sigma (X_\text{max})$ is also greater than the
model predictions. When fixing the expected normalisation of
$\sigma(X_\mathrm{max})$ to that suggested by the QGSJetII-04 model, a slightly
larger fraction of protons is obtained. These results remain sensitive to the
other model parameters that we keep fixed, such as the elongation rate and the
$<X_\text{max}>$ separation between p and Fe.

formulations. Kalman filtering and smoothing are work-horse algorithms in these
settings. While classic algorithms assume Gaussian errors to simplify
estimation, recent advances use a broader range of optimization formulations to
allow outlier-robust estimation, as well as constraints to capture prior
information.
  Here we develop methods on state-space models where either innovations or
error covariances may be singular. These models frequently arise in navigation
(e.g. for `colored noise' models or deterministic integrals) and are ubiquitous
in auto-correlated time series models such as ARMA. We reformulate all
state-space models (singular as well as nonsinguar) as constrained convex
optimization problems, and develop an efficient algorithm for this
reformulation. The convergence rate is {\it locally linear}, with constants
that do not depend on the conditioning of the problem.
  Numerical comparisons show that the new approach outperforms competing
approaches for {\it nonsingular} models, including state of the art interior
point (IP) methods. IP methods converge at superlinear rates; we expect them to
dominate. However, the steep rate of the proposed approach (independent of
problem conditioning) combined with cheap iterations wins against IP in a
run-time comparison. We therefore suggest that the proposed approach be the
{\it default choice} for estimating state space models outside of the Gaussian
context, regardless of whether the error covariances are singular or not.

analyzing NGS data lack the capability of exploiting the richer information
embedded in temporal data. Several recent tools have been developed to analyze
such data but they typically impose strict model assumptions, such as
smoothness on gene expression dynamic changes. To capture a broader range of
gene expression dynamic patterns, we develop the gamma Markov negative binomial
(GMNB) model that integrates a gamma Markov chain into a negative binomial
distribution model, allowing flexible temporal variation in NGS count data.
Using Bayes factors, GMNB enables more powerful temporal gene differential
expression analysis across different phenotypes or treatment conditions. In
addition, it naturally handles the heterogeneity of sequencing depth in
different samples, removing the need for ad-hoc normalization. Efficient Gibbs
sampling inference of the GMNB model parameters is achieved by exploiting novel
data augmentation techniques. Extensive experiments on both simulated and

calculate the trimer spectrum throughout the crossover from two to three

unaffected by realistic quasi-2D confinements, while the first excited trimer
smoothly evolves from a 3D-like Efimov trimer to an extended 2D-like trimer as
the attractive interactions are decreased. We furthermore compute the excited
trimer wave function and quantify the stability of the trimer with respect to
three-body recombination by determining the probability that three fermions
approach each other at short distances. Our results indicate that the lifetime
of the trimer can be enhanced by at least an order of magnitude in the quasi-2D

quantity. Due to the closed string tachyon, the full amplitude is badly
divergent from the closed string degeneration region $t\to0^+$ of the Schwinger
parameter. We obtain expansions for the finite factors from the squeezed state
matrix ${\bf R}(t)$ characterizing the ghost part of the tadpole in Siegel
gauge. The analytic structure of the integrands, as a function of the Schwinger
parameter, captures the correct linear order behaviour near both the closed and
open string degeneration limits. Using a geometric series for the matrix
inverse, we obtain an approximation for the even parity matrix elements. We
employ an expansion based on results from the oscillator basis to construct
Pad\'e approximants to further analyse hints of non-analyticity near this

string diagrams contributing to the one-loop $2$-point function in open string

  Embedding",,,,,"cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Network embedding in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is a
challenging task, due to complications of different node types and rich
relationships between nodes. As a result, conventional network embedding
techniques cannot work on such HINs. Recently, metapath-based approaches have
been proposed to characterize relationships in HINs, but they are ineffective
in capturing rich contexts and semantics between nodes for embedding learning,
mainly because (1) metapath is a rather strict single path node-node
relationship descriptor, which is unable to accommodate variance in
relationships, and (2) only a small portion of paths can match the metapath,
resulting in sparse context information for embedding learning. In this paper,
we advocate a new metagraph concept to capture richer structural contexts and
semantics between distant nodes. A metagraph contains multiple paths between
nodes, each describing one type of relationships, so the augmentation of
multiple metapaths provides an effective way to capture rich contexts and
semantic relations between nodes. This greatly boosts the ability of
metapath-based embedding techniques in handling very sparse HINs. We propose a
new embedding learning algorithm, namely MetaGraph2Vec, which uses metagraph to
guide the generation of random walks and to learn latent embeddings of
multi-typed HIN nodes. Experimental results show that MetaGraph2Vec is able to
outperform the state-of-the-art baselines in various heterogeneous network
mining tasks such as node classification, node clustering, and similarity
search.

intensively studied on static images, their extensions in videos are never
explored. Compared with images, attacking a video needs to consider not only
spatial cues but also temporal cues. Moreover, to improve the imperceptibility
as well as reduce the computation cost, perturbations should be added on as
fewer frames as possible, i.e., adversarial perturbations are temporally
sparse. This further motivates the propagation of perturbations, which denotes
that perturbations added on the current frame can transfer to the next frames
via their temporal interactions. Thus, no (or few) extra perturbations are
needed for these frames to misclassify them. To this end, we propose an
l2,1-norm based optimization algorithm to compute the sparse adversarial
perturbations for videos. We choose the action recognition as the targeted
task, and networks with a CNN+RNN architecture as threat models to verify our
method. Thanks to the propagation, we can compute perturbations on a shortened
version video, and then adapt them to the long version video to fool DNNs.
Experimental results on the UCF101 dataset demonstrate that even only one frame
in a video is perturbed, the fooling rate can still reach 59.7%.

the population stability problem. A system of agents each with limited memory
and communication, as well as the ability to replicate and self-destruct, is
subjected to attacks by a worst-case adversary that can at a bounded rate (1)
delete agents chosen arbitrarily and (2) insert additional agents with
arbitrary initial state into the system. The goal is perpetually to maintain a
population whose size is within a constant factor of the target size $N$. The
problem is inspired by the ability of complex biological systems composed of a
multitude of memory-limited individual cells to maintain a stable population
size in an adverse environment. Such biological mechanisms allow organisms to
heal after trauma or to recover from excessive cell proliferation caused by
inflammation, disease, or normal development.
  We present a population stability protocol in a communication model that is a
synchronous variant of the population model of Angluin et al. In each round,
pairs of agents selected at random meet and exchange messages, where at least a
constant fraction of agents is matched in each round. Our protocol uses
three-bit messages and $\omega(\log^2 N)$ states per agent. We emphasize that
our protocol can handle an adversary that can both insert and delete agents, a
setting in which existing approximate counting techniques do not seem to apply.
The protocol relies on a novel coloring strategy in which the population size
is encoded in the variance of the distribution of colors. Individual agents can
locally obtain a weak estimate of the population size by sampling from the
distribution, and make individual decisions that robustly maintain a stable
global population size.

(PPMN) with specially designed Pyramid Matching Module to address the problem
of person re-identification. The architecture takes a pair of RGB images as
input, and outputs a similiarity value indicating whether the two input images
represent the same person or not. Based on deep convolutional neural networks,
our approach first learns the discriminative semantic representation with the
semantic-component-aware features for persons and then employs the Pyramid
Matching Module to match the common semantic-components of persons, which is
robust to the variation of spatial scales and misalignment of locations posed
by viewpoint changes. The above two processes are jointly optimized via a
unified end-to-end deep learning scheme. Extensive experiments on several

with the nearest-neighbor repulsion by using time-dependent Gutzwiller (GW)
methods. In particular, we vary the hopping parameters in the Hamiltonian as a
function of time, and investigate the dynamics of the system from the density
wave (DW) to the superfluid (SF) crossing a first-order phase transition and
vice-versa. From the DW to SF, we find scaling laws for the correlation length
and vortex density with respect to the quench time. This is a reminiscence of
the Kibble-Zurek scaling for continuous phase transitions and contradicts the
common expectation. We give a possible explanation for this observation. On the
other hand from the SF to DW, the system evolution depends on the initial SF
state. When the initial state is the ground-state obtained by the static GW
methods, a coexisting state of the SF and DW domains forms after passing
through the critical point. Coherence of the SF order parameter is lost as the
system evolves. This is a phenomenon similar to the glass transition in
classical systems. When the state starts from the SF with small local phase
fluctuations, the system obtains a large-size DW-domain structure with thin
domain walls.

Coverings of graphs with balls of radius one and packings of vertices with

independence, respectively. In 2001, Erwin introduced \emph{broadcast
domination} in graphs, a covering problem using balls of various radii, where
the cost of a ball is its radius. The minimum cost of a dominating broadcast in
a graph $G$ is denoted by $\gamma_b(G)$. The dual (in the sense of linear
programming) of broadcast domination is \emph{multipacking}: a multipacking is
a set $P \subseteq V(G)$ such that for any vertex $v$ and any positive integer
$r$, the ball of radius $r$ around $v$ contains at most $r$ vertices of $P$.
The maximum size of a multipacking in a graph $G$ is denoted by $mp(G)$.
Naturally, $mp(G) \leq \gamma_b(G)$. Hartnell and Mynhardt proved that
$\gamma_b(G) \leq 3 mp(G) - 2$ (whenever $mp(G)\geq 2$). In this paper, we show
that $\gamma_b(G) \leq 2mp(G) + 3$. Moreover, we conjecture that this can be
improved to $\gamma_b(G) \leq 2mp(G)$ (which would be sharp).

The $30\,\mbox{cm}$ meteoroid entered at 15.44 $\mbox{km s}^{-1}$, followed a

Dingle Dell is the fourth meteorite recovered by the DFN in Australia, but the

nucleation is assisted by local structure order coupling conformational and
local rotational symmetric orderings, while flow_induced nucleation is promoted
by density fluctuation, which is a coupling effect of conformational and

its exibility and analytical tractability. Its computational bottleneck is the
inversion of a covariance matrix, which takes $O(n^3)$ time in general and
becomes prohibitive for large n, where n is the number of design points.
Moreover, the covariance matrix is often ill-conditioned for large n, and thus
the inversion is prone to numerical instability, resulting in erroneous
parameter estimation and prediction. These two numerical issues preclude the
use of stochastic kriging at a large scale. This paper presents a novel
approach to address them. We construct a class of covariance functions, called
Markovian covariance functions (MCFs), which have two properties: (i) the
associated covariance matrices can be inverted analytically, and (ii) the
inverse matrices are sparse. With the use of MCFs, the inversion-related
computational time is reduced to $O(n^2)$ in general, and can be further
reduced by orders of magnitude with additional assumptions on the simulation
errors and design points. The analytical invertibility also enhance the
numerical stability dramatically. The key in our approach is that we identify a
general functional form of covariance functions that can induce sparsity in the
corresponding inverse matrices. We also establish a connection between MCFs and
linear ordinary differential equations. Such a connection provides a flexible,
principled approach to constructing a wide class of MCFs. Extensive numerical
experiments demonstrate that stochastic kriging with MCFs can handle
large-scale problems in an both computationally efficient and numerically
stable manner.

Nature but it also characterises the dynamics of human actions and
interactions. At the phenomenological level it is a feature of all systems that
evolve heterogeneously over time by alternating between periods of low and high
event frequencies. In such systems, bursts are identified as periods in which
the events occur with a rapid pace within a short time-interval while these
periods are separated by long periods of time with low frequency of events. As
such dynamical patterns occur in a wide range of natural phenomena, their
observation, characterisation, and modelling have been a long standing
challenge in several fields of research. However, due to some recent
developments in communication and data collection techniques it has become
possible to follow digital traces of actions and interactions of humans from
the individual up to the societal level. This led to several new observations
of bursty phenomena in the new but largely unexplored area of human dynamics,
which called for the renaissance to study these systems using research concepts
and methodologies, including data analytics and modelling. As a result, a large
amount of new insight and knowledge as well as innovations have been
accumulated in the field, which provided us a timely opportunity to write this
brief monograph to make an up-to-date review and summary of the observations,

individual KaiC molecules. In the present paper, we explain two coarse-grained
theoretical models, the many-molecule (MM) model and the single-molecule (SM)
model, to bridge the gap between macroscopic and microscopic understandings. In
the simulation results with these models, ATP hydrolysis drives oscillation of
individual KaiC hexamers and ATP hydrolysis is necessary for synchronizing
oscillations of a large number of KaiC hexamers. Sensitive temperature
dependence of the lifetime of the ADP bound state in the CI domain of KaiC
hexamers makes the oscillation period temperature insensitive. ATPase activity
is correlated to the frequency of phosphorylation oscillation in the single
molecule of KaiC hexamer, which should be the origin of the observed
ensemble-level correlation between the ATPase activity and the frequency of
phosphorylation oscillation. Thus, the simulation results with the MM and SM
models suggest that ATP hydrolysis randomly occurring in each CI domain of
individual KaiC hexamers is a key process for oscillatory behaviors of the
ensemble of many KaiC hexamers.

interaction, can be determined with high precision from the atomic X-ray
spectroscopy, and this experimental method provides unique information to
understand the low energy kaon-nucleus interaction at the production threshold.
The lightest atomic systems, like the kaonic hydrogen and the kaonic deuterium
deliver, in a model-independent way, the isospin-dependent kaon-nucleon
scattering lengths. The most precise kaonic hydrogen measurement to-date,
together with an exploratory measurement of kaonic deuterium, were carried out
in 2009 by the SIDDHARTA collaboration at the DA{\Phi}NE electron-positron
collider of LNF-INFN, combining the excellent quality kaon beam delivered by
the collider with new experimental techniques, as fast and very precise X-ray
detectors, like the Silicon Drift Detectors. The SIDDHARTA results triggered
new theoretical work, which achieved major progress in the understanding of the
low-energy strong interaction with strangeness reflected by the
antikaon-nucleon scattering lengths calculated with the antikaon-proton
amplitudes constrained by the SIDDHARTA data. The most important open question
is the experimental determination of the hadronic energy shift and width of
kaonic deuterium; presently, a major upgrade of the setup, SIDDHARTA-2, is
being realized to reach this goal. In this paper, the results obtained in 2009
and the proposed SIDDHARTA-2 upgrades are presented.

Here, we introduce a new generation of devices for fast caloritronics able to
control local heat power and temperature through manipulation of Josephson
vortices, i.e., solitons. Although most salient features concerning Josephson
vortices in long Josephson junctions were comprehensively hitherto explored,
little is known about soliton-sustained coherent thermal transport. We
demonstrate that the soliton configuration determines the temperature profile
in the junction, so that, in correspondence of each magnetically induced
soliton, both the flowing thermal power and the temperature significantly
enhance. Finally, we thoroughly discuss a fast solitonic Josephson heat
oscillator, whose frequency is in tune with the oscillation frequency of the
magnetic drive. Notably, the proposed heat oscillator can effectively find
application as a tunable thermal source for nanoscale heat engines and coherent
thermal machines.

reduced due to the high boron solubility, as well as the large specific surface

and the aspect ratio $\rho$, which is the ratio of the inner and outer square
edge lengths. The WORS exists for all geometrical parameters and for all
temperatures; we prove that the WORS is globally stable for either $\lambda$
small enough or for $\rho$ sufficiently close to unity. We study three
different types of critical points in this model setting: critical points with
the minimal two degrees of freedom consistent with the imposed boundary
conditions, critical points with three degrees of freedom and critical points
with five degrees of freedom. In the two-dimensional case, we use
$\Gamma$-convergence techniques to identify the energy-minimizing competitors.
We decompose the second variation of the Landau-de Gennes energy into three

many applied disciplines, as the maximum entropy distribution associated to any
set of correlated binary (`spin') variables with observed means and
covariances. However, numerically speaking, the Ising distribution is
unpractical, so alternative models are often preferred to handle correlated
binary data. One popular alternative, especially in life sciences, is the Cox
distribution (or the closely related dichotomized Gaussian distribution and
log-normal Cox point process), where the spins are generated independently
conditioned on the drawing of a latent variable with a multivariate normal
distribution. This article explores the conditions for a principled replacement
of the Ising distribution by a Cox distribution. It shows that the Ising
distribution itself can be treated as a latent variable model, and it explores
when this latent variable has a quasi-normal distribution. A variational
approach to this question reveals a formal link with classic mean-field
methods, especially Opper and Winther's adaptive TAP approximation. This link
is confirmed by weak coupling (Plefka) expansions of the different
approximations and then by numerical tests. Overall, this study suggests that
an Ising distribution can be replaced by a Cox distribution in practical
applications, precisely when its parameters lie in the `mean-field domain'.

The pipeline adds new source lists to the archive database, while
cross-matching them with the known cataloged sources in order to build a full

partitioning the largest tables, allowing for faster positional source look-ups

pipeline runs where we processed a subset of IPHAS data that have image source
density peaks over $170,000$ per field of view ($500,000$ deg$^{-2}$).
  Our analysis demonstrates that horizontal table partitions of declination
widths of one-degree control the query run times. Usage of an index strategy
where the partitions are densily sorted according to source declination yields
another improvement. Most queries run in sublinear time and a few (<20%) run in
linear time, because of dependencies on input source-list and result-set size.

parametric decay instability (PDI) in the solar wind, focusing on the
suppression effect by the wind acceleration and expansion. We also discuss the
role of PDI in generating the density fluctuation in the solar wind and the
cross-helicity evolution up to $1 {\rm \ au}$. Numerical simulations from the
coronal base to 1 au are conducted in a self-consistent manner; we take into
account the feedback of wave energy and pressure in the background.
Monochromatic waves with various injection frequencies $f_0$ are injected to
discuss the suppression of PDI, while broadband waves are applied to compare
the numerical results with observation. We find, via the simulations with
monochromatic waves, that high-frequency ($f_0 \gtrsim10^{-3} {\rm \ Hz}$)
Alfv\'en waves are subject to PDI. Meanwhile, the maximum growth rate of the
PDI of low-frequency ($f_0 \lesssim10^{-4} {\rm \ Hz}$) Alfv\'en waves becomes
negative due to acceleration and expansion effects. Medium-frequency ($f_0
\approx 10^{-3.5} {\rm \ Hz}$) Alfv\'en waves have a positive growth rate but
do not show the signature of PDI up to 1 au because the growth rate is too
small. The medium-frequency waves experience neither PDI nor reflection so they
propagate through the solar wind most efficiently. This is called the
frequency-filtering mechanism of the solar wind. The simulations with broadband

calculate the stretched capsule shape numerically and a coupled finite element
and boundary element method to solve the corresponding magnetostatic problem,
and employ analytical linear response theory, approximative energy
minimization, and slender-body theory. The observed deformation behavior is
qualitatively similar to the deformation of ferrofluid droplets in uniform
magnetic fields. Homogeneous magnetic fields elongate the capsule, and a
discontinuous shape transition from a spheroidal shape to a conical shape takes
place at a critical field strength. We investigate how capsule elasticity
modifies this hysteretic shape transition. We show that conical capsule shapes
are possible but involve diverging stretch factors at the tips, which gives
rise to rupture for real capsule materials. In a slender-body approximation we
find that the critical susceptibility above which conical shapes occur for
ferrofluid capsules is the same as for droplets. At small fields capsules
remain spheroidal, and we characterize the deformation of spheroidal capsules
both analytically and numerically. Finally, we determine whether wrinkling of a
spheroidal capsule occurs during elongation in a magnetic field and how it
modifies the stretching behavior. We find the nontrivial dependence between the
extent of the wrinkled region and capsule elongation. Our results can be
helpful in order to quantitatively determine capsule or ferrofluid material
properties from magnetic deformation experiments. All results also apply to
elastic capsules filled with a dielectric liquid in an external uniform

They

Paramagnetic metals typically used are close to a ferromagnetic instability and
thus magnetic proximity effects can contribute to the observed
angular-dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR). As interface phenomena govern the
spin conductance across the metal/ferromagnetic-insulator heterostructures,
unraveling these distinct contributions is pivotal to full understanding of
spin current conductance. We report here x-ray absorption and magnetic circular

energy loss electron spectroscopy (EELS) data of Pt/CoFe2O4 bilayers where
CoFe2O4 layers have been capped by Pt grown at different temperatures. It turns
out that the ADMR differs dramatically, being either dominated by spin Hall
magnetoresistance (SMR) associated to spin Hall effect or anisotropic
magnetoresistance (AMR). The XMCD and EELS data indicate that the Pt layer
grown at room temperature does not display any magnetic moment, whereas when
grown at higher temperature it is magnetic due to interfacial Pt-(Co,Fe)
alloying. These results allow disentangling spin accumulation from interfacial

gravity is able to mimic cosmological dark matter, has tensorial perturbations
that travel exactly at the speed of light but has vanishing scalar
perturbations and this fact persists if we combine mimetic with Horndeski

in community detection and motif finding, is the sampling of graphs with fixed
degree sequence. The equivalent problem of generating random 0,1 matrices with
fixed row and column sums is frequently used as a quantitative tool in ecology.
It has however proven very challenging to design sampling algorithms that are
both fast and unbiased.
  This article focusses on Markov chain approaches for sampling, where a
close-to-random graph is produced by applying a large number N of small changes
to a given graph. Examples are the switch chain and Curveball chain, which are
both commonly used by practitioners as they are easy to implement and known to
sample unbiased when N is large enough. Within theoretical research, much
effort has gone into proving bounds on N. However, existing theoretical bounds
are impractically large for most applications while experiments suggest that
much fewer steps are needed to obtain a good sample.
  The contribution of this article is twofold. Firstly it is a step towards
better understanding of the discrepancy between experimental observations and
theoretically proven bounds. In particular, we argue that while existing Markov
chain algorithms run on the set of all labelled graphs with a given degree
sequence, node labels are unimportant in practice and are usually ignored in
determining experimental bounds. We prove that ignoring node labels corresponds
to projecting a Markov chain onto equivalence classes of isomorphic graphs and
that the resulting projected Markov chain converges to its stationary
distribution at least as fast as the original Markov chain. Often convergence
is much faster, as we show in examples, explaining part of the difference
between theory and experiments...

limelight, especially for imaging data. Classification does not fully meet a
clinician's needs, however: in order to combine the results of multiple tests
and decide on a course of treatment, a clinician needs the likelihood of a
given health condition rather than binary classification yielded by such
methods. We illustrate how likelihoods can be derived step by step from first
principles and approximations, and how they can be assessed and selected,
illustrating our approach using fMRI data from a publicly available data set
containing schizophrenic and healthy control subjects. We start from the basic
assumption of partial exchangeability, and then the notion of sufficient
statistics and the ""method of translation"" (Edgeworth, 1898) combined with
conjugate priors. This method can be used to construct a likelihood that can be
used to compare different data-reduction algorithms. Despite the
simplifications and possibly unrealistic assumptions used to illustrate the
method, we obtain classification results comparable to previous, more realistic
studies about schizophrenia, whilst yielding likelihoods that can naturally be
combined with the results of other diagnostic tests.

the growth of entanglement entropy. Although direct experimental measurements

among uranium miners, it has been revealed that radon acts as a promoting agent
facilitating the clonal expansion of already mutated cells. Clonal expansion
rate increases non-linearly by radon concentration showing a plateau above a
given exposure rate. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Earlier we
proposed that progenitor cell hyperplasia may be induced upon chronic radon
exposure. The objective of the present study is to test whether the induction
of hyperplasia may provide a quantitative explanation for the plateau in clonal
expansion rate. For this purpose, numerical epithelium models were prepared
with different number of basal cells. Cell nucleus hits were computed by an
own-developed Monte-Carlo code. Surviving fractions were estimated based on the
number of cell nucleus hits. Cell division rate was computed supposing
equilibrium between cell death and cell division. It was also supposed that
clonal expansion rate is proportional to cell division rate, and therefore the
relative increase in cell division rate and clonal expansion rate are the same
functions of exposure rate. While the simulation results highly depend on model
parameters with high uncertainty, a parameter set has been found resulting in a
cell division rate exposure rate relationship corresponding to the plateau in
clonal expansion rate. Due to the high uncertainty of the applied parameters,
however, further studies are required to decide whether the induction of
hyperplasia is responsible for the non-linear increase in clonal expansion rate
or not. Nevertheless the present study exemplifies how computational modelling
can contribute to the integration of observational and experimental radiation
protection research.

developed. The natural frequencies and mode shapes of cantilever, simple
supported, and clamped-clamped microbeams are determined depending on the beam
surface roughness. A parametric study is presented demonstrating two prospects:
surface roughness may lead to a zero-frequency mode or a mode localization. As
for the first prospect, it is demonstrated that surface roughness may add more
softness to a specific mode of vibration and reduce its natural frequency
causing a rigid-body mode. As for the second prospect, surface roughness may
inhibit the propagation of vibration energy throughout the beam length leading
to a mode localization. It is revealed that a mode localization is accompanied
with an increase in the natural frequency of the microbeam. It is revealed that
the description of the beam vibration according to one of these two prospects
depends on the beam size, parameters of the surface roughness, and the boundary
conditions.

Geminga and Monogem indicate a very slow diffusion of cosmic rays, which
results in tiny contribution of positrons from these two pulsars to the local
flux. This makes the cosmic positron excess anomaly observed by PAMELA and
AMS-02 even more puzzling. However, from the Boron-to-Carbon ratio data one can
infer that the average diffusion coefficient in the Galaxy should be much
larger. In this work we propose a two-zone diffusion model that the diffusion
is slow only in a small region around the source, outside of which the
propagation is as fast as usual. We find that such a scenario can naturally
explain the positron excess data with parameters even more reasonable than that
in the conventional one-zone diffusion model. The reason is that during the
life time of Geminga ($\sim 300$ kyr) the electrons/positrons have propagated
too far away with a fast diffusion and lead to a low local flux. The slow
diffusion region in the two-zone model helps to confine the electrons/positrons
for a long time and lead to an enhancement of the local flux. So under the
constraint of the HAWC observations, pulsars are still the probable origin of
the cosmic-ray positron excess.

extensively investigated over recent decades. In this paper, we propose a novel
recurrent convolutional neural network (ReCNN) architecture, which is trained
to learn a joint spectral-spatial-temporal feature representation in a unified
framework for change detection in multispectral images. To this end, we bring
together a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network
(RNN) into one end-to-end network. The former is able to generate rich
spectral-spatial feature representations, while the latter effectively analyzes
temporal dependency in bi-temporal images. In comparison with previous
approaches to change detection, the proposed network architecture possesses
three distinctive properties: 1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to
most existing methods whose components are separately trained or computed; 2)
it naturally harnesses spatial information that has been proven to be
beneficial to change detection task; 3) it is capable of adaptively learning
the temporal dependency between multitemporal images, unlike most of algorithms
that use fairly simple operation like image differencing or stacking. As far as
we know, this is the first time that a recurrent convolutional network
architecture has been proposed for multitemporal remote sensing image analysis.
The proposed network is validated on real multispectral data sets. Both visual
and quantitative analysis of experimental results demonstrates competitive
performance in the proposed mode.

stronger results about quasiperiods of Sturmian words. We demonstrate this by
showing that all biinfinite Sturmian words have infinitely many quasiperiods,

characterization of those quasiperiods.
  The main difference between right infinite and the biinfinite words is that,
in the latter case, we might have several quasiperiods of the same length. This
is not possible with right infinite words because a quasiperiod has to be a
prefix of the word. We study in depth the relations between quasiperiods of the

program of upgrades of the beam intensity, the T2K-II proposal for
$20\times10^{21}$ POT aimed at establishing CP violation at $3\sigma$ level for
a significant fraction of the possible $\delta_{CP}$ values. The Hyper-K
proposal consists of a further increase by a factor $10$ of the far detector
mass. Facing the potential increase of statistics by two orders of magnitude,
it is of great importance to undertake a vigorous program of near detector
upgrade, with the aim of reducing the overall statistical and systematic
uncertainties at the appropriate level of better than $4\%$. The design and
performance of the proposed upgraded near-detector will be reported in these

unit circle, which are transformed into incoherent phase-locked states. It has
been recently shown that such systems can be reduced to a three-dimensional
system of ordinary differential equations, whose mathematical structure is
strongly related to hyperbolic geometry. The orbits of the Kuramoto dynamical
system are then described by a ow of M\""obius transformations. We show this
underlying dynamic performs statistical inference by computing dynamically
M-estimates of scatter matrices. We also describe the limiting phase-locked
states for random initial conditions using Tyler's transformation matrix.
Moreover, we show the repulsive Kuramoto model performs dynamically not only
robust covariance matrix estimation, but also data processing: the initial
configuration of the n points is transformed by the dynamic into a limiting
phase-locked state that surprisingly equals the spatial signs from
nonparametric statistics. That makes the sign empirical covariance matrix to

The non-convex problem of finding the complex field that generates the correct

used to obtain the convex relaxation of the phase retrieval problem. A new
iterative method, indicated as Convex Optimization-based Phase Retrieval
(COPR), is presented, with each iteration consisting of solving a convex

storage layer in out-of-plane magnetized tunnel junctions (pMTJ) as compared to
conventional pMTJ in order to induce a perpendicular shape anisotropy (PSA) in
this layer. This PSA is obtained by depositing a thick ferromagnetic (FM) layer
on top of an MgO/FeCoB based magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) so that the
thickness of the storage layer becomes of the order or larger than the diameter
of the MTJ pillar. In contrast to conventional spin transfer torque magnetic
random access memory (STT-MRAM) wherein the demagnetizing energy opposes the
interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (iPMA), in these novel memory
cells, both PSA and iPMA contributions favor out-of-plane orientation of the
storage layer magnetization. Using thicker storage layers in these PSA-STT-MRAM
has several advantages. Thanks to the PSA, very high and easily tunable thermal
stability factors can be achieved, even down to sub-10 nm diameters. Moreover,
low damping material can be used for the thick FM material thus leading to a
reduction of the write current. The paper describes this new PSA-STT-MRAM
concept, practical realization of such memory arrays, magnetic characterization

structure models; prior work has suggested that inefficient convective heat
transport, due to rotation and/or magnetism, may ultimately be responsible. We
examine this issue using 1D stellar models constructed using Modules for
Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). First, we consider standard models
that do not explicitly include rotational/magnetic effects, with convective
inhibition modeled by decreasing a depth-independent mixing length theory (MLT)
parameter $\alpha_{\text{MLT}}$ (following Cox et al. 1981; Chabrier et al.
2007). We provide formulae linking changes in $\alpha_{\text{MLT}}$ to changes
in the interior specific entropy, and hence to the stellar radius. Next, we
modify the MLT formulation in MESA to mimic explicitly the influence of
rotation and magnetism, using formulations suggested by Stevenson (1979) and
MacDonald & Mullan (2014) respectively. We find rapid rotation in these models
has a negligible impact on stellar structure, primarily because a star's
adiabat, and hence its radius, is predominantly affected by layers near the
surface; convection is rapid and largely uninfluenced by rotation there.
Magnetic fields, if they influenced convective transport in the manner
described by MacDonald & Mullan (2014), could lead to more noticeable radius
inflation. Finally, we show that these non-standard effects on stellar
structure can be fabricated using a depth-dependent $\alpha_{\text{MLT}}$: a
non-magnetic, non-rotating model can be produced that is virtually
indistinguishable from one that explicitly parameterizes rotation and/or
magnetism using the two formulations above. We provide formulae linking the
radially-variable $\alpha_{\text{MLT}}$ to these putative MLT reformulations.

parameters varies are ubiquitous in nature and in engineering applications.
Despite a vast literature focusing on this topic, there are few studies dealing
with the effect of the rate of change of the bifurcation parameter on the
tipping points. In this work, we consider a subcritical stochastic Hopf
bifurcation under two scenarios: the bifurcation parameter is first changed in
a quasi-steady manner and then, with a finite ramping rate. In the latter case,
a rate-dependent bifurcation delay is observed and exemplified experimentally
using a thermoacoustic instability in a combustion chamber. This delay
increases with the rate of change. This leads to a state transition of larger
amplitude compared to the one that would be experienced by the system with a
quasi-steady change of the parameter. We also bring experimental evidence of a
dynamic hysteresis caused by the bifurcation delay when the parameter is ramped
back. A surrogate model is derived in order to predict the statistic of these
delays and to scrutinise the underlying stochastic dynamics. Our study
highlights the dramatic influence of a finite rate of change of bifurcation
parameters upon tipping points and it pinpoints the crucial need of considering
this effect when investigating critical transitions.

inaccurate efficiency scores may be obtained. This happens because a
non-countable (continuous) production possibility set is determined on a basis
of a finite number of production units. It has been proposed in the literature
to use artificial production units in the primal space of inputs and outputs as
a starting point in order to improve the frontier of the DEA models. Farrell
was the first who introduced artificial units in the primal space of inputs and
outputs in order to secure convex isoquants. In previous papers we introduced
the notion of terminal units. Moreover, some relationships were established
between terminal units and other sets of units that were proposed for improving
envelopment. In this paper we develop an algorithm for improving the frontier.
The construction of algorithm is based on the notion of terminal units. Our
theoretical results are verified by computational experiments using real-life
data sets and also confirmed by graphical examples.

estimates could be established that are analogous to the ones known for

preferential voting raises new questions about how to approximate consensus

the most direct witnesses of the early history of our Solar System. Those
satellites allow study of the mass, and hence density and internal structure.
We study here the properties of the triple asteroid (107) Camilla from
lightcurves, stellar occultations, optical spectroscopy, and high-contrast and
high-angular-resolution images and spectro-images. Using 80 positions over 15
years, we determine the orbit of its larger satellite to be circular,
equatorial, and prograde, with RMS residuals of 7.8 mas. From 11 positions in
three epochs only, in 2015 and 2016, we determine a preliminary orbit for the
second satellite. We find the orbit to be somewhat eccentric and slightly
inclined to the primary's equatorial plane, reminiscent of the inner satellites
of other asteroid triple systems. Comparison of the near-infrared spectrum of
the larger satellite reveals no significant difference with Camilla. Hence,
these properties argue for a formation of the satellites by excavation from
impact and re-accumulation of ejecta. We determine the spin and 3-D shape of
Camilla. The model fits well each data set. We determine Camilla to be larger
than reported from modeling of mid-infrared photometry, with a
spherical-volume-equivalent diameter of 254 $\pm$ 36 km (3 $\sigma$
uncertainty), in agreement with recent results from shape modeling
(Hanus2017+). Combining the mass of (1.12 $\pm$ 0.01) $\times$ 10$^{19}$ kg
determined from the dynamics of the satellites and the volume from the 3-D
shape model, we determine a density of 1,280 $\pm$ 130 SI. From this density,
and considering Camilla's spectral similarities with (24) Themis and (65)
Cybele (for which water ice coating on surface grains was reported), we infer a

manually. However, the huge demand for more regular inspections as
infrastructure ages, coupled with the limited time window available for
inspection, has rendered manual inspection increasingly insufficient. With
shortened inspection time and reduced labor cost, automated inspection using a
combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground vehicles (cars) has
emerged as an attractive alternative to manual inspection. In this paper, we
propose a path planning framework that generates optimal plans for UAVs and
cars to inspect water canals in a large agricultural area (tens of square
kilometers). In addition to optimality, the paths need to satisfy several
constraints, in order to guarantee UAV navigation safety and to abide by local
traffic regulations. In the proposed framework, the canal and road networks are
first modeled as two graphs, which are then partitioned into smaller subgraphs
that can be covered by a given fleet of UAVs within one battery charge. The
problem of finding optimal paths for both UAVs and cars on the graphs, subject
to the constraints, is formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP).
The proposed framework can also quickly generate new plans when a current plan
is interrupted. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by
simulation results showing the successful generation of plans covering all
given canal segments, and the ability to quickly revise the plan when
conditions change.

64892, imaged with VLT/SPHERE during the SHINE exoplanet survey. The host is a
B9.5V member of the Lower-Centaurus-Crux subgroup of the Scorpius Centaurus OB
association. The measured angular separation of the companion
($1.2705\pm0.0023$"") corresponds to a projected distance of $159\pm12$ AU. We
observed the target with the dual-band imaging and long-slit spectroscopy modes
of the IRDIS imager to obtain its SED and astrometry. In addition, we
reprocessed archival NACO L-band data, from which we also recover the
companion. Its SED is consistent with a young (<30 Myr), low surface gravity
object with a spectral type of M9$_{\gamma}\pm1$. From comparison with the
BT-Settl atmospheric models we estimate an effective temperature of
$T_{\textrm{eff}}=2600 \pm 100$ K, and comparison of the companion photometry
to the COND evolutionary models yields a mass of $\sim29-37$ M$_{\text{J}}$ at
the estimated age of $16^{+15}_{-7}$ Myr for the system. HIP 64892 is a rare
example of an extreme-mass ratio system ($q\sim0.01$) and will be useful for
testing models relating to the formation and evolution of such low-mass
objects.

structure in networks. Typically, only the adjacency matrix is used to perform
SBM parameter inference. In this paper, we consider circumstances in which
nodes have an associated vector of continuous attributes that are also used to
learn the node-to-community assignments and corresponding SBM parameters. While
this assumption is not realistic for every application, our model assumes that
the attributes associated with the nodes in a network's community can be
described by a common multivariate Gaussian model. In this augmented,
attributed SBM, the objective is to simultaneously learn the SBM connectivity
probabilities with the multivariate Gaussian parameters describing each
community. While there are recent examples in the literature that combine
connectivity and attribute information to inform community detection, our model
is the first augmented stochastic block model to handle multiple continuous
attributes. This provides the flexibility in biological data to, for example,
augment connectivity information with continuous measurements from multiple
experimental modalities. Because the lack of labeled network data often makes
community detection results difficult to validate, we highlight the usefulness
of our model for two network prediction tasks: link prediction and
collaborative filtering. As a result of fitting this attributed stochastic
block model, one can predict the attribute vector or connectivity patterns for
a new node in the event of the complementary source of information
(connectivity or attributes, respectively). We also highlight two biological
examples where the attributed stochastic block model provides satisfactory
performance in the link prediction and collaborative filtering tasks.

procedure, we calculate effective interactions between gold nanoparticles,
which are considered both bare and coated with polyethylene chains, in order to
investigate the effects of the grafting density \rho_g on the PMF. Upon
performing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, it turns out that silica
nanoparticles experience similar interactions regardless of the particle size,
the most remarkable difference being a peak in the PMF due to surface
interactions, clearly apparent for the larger size. As for bare gold
nanoparticles, they are slightly interacting, the strength of the effective
force increasing for the coated cases. The profile of the resulting PMF
resembles a Lennard-Jones potentials for intermediate \rho_g , becoming
progressively more repulsive for high \rho_g and low interparticle separations.

echocardiographic segments are expanded based on their strain components over
the time. Ejected blood volume fraction induced by a left myocardial sample, is
computed within a cardiac cycle. Total fraction of the ejected blood volume in
the left ventricular cavity was obtained by integrating over the times and LV
myocardial segments. EF is an especial value of this total fraction at the end

  Even though the MZ formalism is exact, its straightforward application to the
problem of constructing reduced models for estimating uncertainty involves the
computation of memory terms whose cost can become prohibitively expensive. For
those cases, we present a Markovian reformulation of the MZ formalism which can
lead to approximations that can alleviate some of the computational expense

connects particle spinors directly forming representations to internal gauge
symmetries to their spacetime counterparts that are embodied by null flags,
another that translates the spacetime spinors into their corresponding tensors
expressed in an orthonormal tetrad, and finally a purely tensorial

scales. We used a network approach to identify and characterize biogeographical

performed following five steps, from the biogeographical bipartite network

identification of clusters of plant species based on the species contribution
to the biogeographical regions. First, we identified two sub-networks that
distinguish Mediterranean and temperate biota. Then, we separated eight
statistically significant bioregions that present a complex spatial structure.
Some of them are spatially well delimited, and match with particular geological
entities. On the other hand fuzzy transitions arise between adjacent bioregions
that share a common geological setting, but are spread along a climatic
gradient. The proposed network approach illustrates the biogeographical
structure of the flora in southern France, and provides precise insights into

drivers shaping the distribution of Mediterranean biota: the interplay between
a climatic gradient and geological substrate shapes biodiversity patterns.

students, scientists, engineers, teachers and managers deserve wider attention.
Besides the stated perceptions and analyses perhaps ignoring socio-political
and scientific temperaments in developing nations, the following questions
arise: How did the BD phenomenon naturally occur, post technological
developments in Computer and Communications Technology and how did different
experts react to it? Are academicians elsewhere agreeing on the fact that BD is
a new science? Granted that big data science is a new science what are its
foundations as compared to conventional topics in Physics, Chemistry or
Biology? Or, is it similar to astronomy or nuclear science? What are the
technological and engineering implications and how these can be advantageously
used to augment business intelligence, for example? Will the industry adopt the
changes due to tactical advantages? How can BD success stories be carried over
elsewhere? How will BD affect the Computer Science and other curricula? How
will BD benefit different segments of our society on a large scale? To answer
these, an appreciation of the BD as a science and as a technology is necessary.
This paper presents a quick BD overview, relying on the contemporary
literature; it addresses: characterizations of BD and the BD people, the
background required for the students and teachers to join the BD bandwagon, the

the flip-flop interaction provides us rich way to realize the quantum
information processing such as quantum communication and quantum computation.

data, including 2-D, 3-D and 4-D seismic surveys, well logs generated by
sensors, detailed lithological records, satellite images and meteorological
records. These data serve important industries, such as the exploration of
mineral deposits and the production of energy (Oil and Gas, Geothermal, Wind,
Hydroelectric), are important in the study of the earth crust to reduce the
impact of earthquakes, in land use planning, and have a fundamental role in
sustainability.
  The volume of raw data being stored by different earth science archives today
makes it impossible to rely on manual examination by scientists. The data
volumes resultant of different sources, from terrestrial or aerial to satellite
surveys, will reach a terabyte per day by the time all the planned satellites
are flown. In particular, the oil industry has been using large quantities of
data for quite a long time. Although there are published works in this area
since the 70s, these days, the ubiquity of computing and sensor devices enables
the collection of higher resolution data in real time, giving a new life to a
mature industrial field. Understanding and finding value in this data has an
impact on the efficiency of the operations in the oil and gas production chain.
Efficiency gains are particularly important since the steep fall in oil prices
in 2014, and represent an important opportunity for data mining and data
science.
