dimensions of the bed, mean inlet velocity, bed height, and amplitude and
frequency of pulsing. It is however important to understand the changes in
granular rheology associated with bubbling patterns. In the experimental work
presented, we report on the results from a small-scale quasi-two-dimensional

Particle Tracking Velocimetry data reveals a redistribution of energy between
the harmonic and sub-harmonic modes as the inlet gas frequency is decreased.
The change in bubbling pattern is accompanied by a change in granular dynamics

stage where propensity scores are estimated and implemented to approximate a
randomized experiment and an analysis stage where treatment effects are
estimated conditional upon the design. This paper considers how uncertainty
associated with the design stage impacts estimation of causal effects in the
analysis stage. Such design uncertainty can derive from the fact that the
propensity score itself is an estimated quantity, but also from other features
of the design stage tied to choice of propensity score implementation. This
paper offers a procedure for obtaining the posterior distribution of causal
effects after marginalizing over a distribution of design-stage outputs,
lending a degree of formality to Bayesian methods for PSA (BPSA) that have
gained attention in recent literature. Formulation of a probability
distribution for the design-stage output depends on how the propensity score is
implemented in the design stage, and propagation of uncertainty into causal
estimates depends on how the treatment effect is estimated in the analysis
stage. We explore these differences within a sample of commonly-used propensity
score implementations (quantile stratification, nearest-neighbor matching,
caliper matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting, and doubly robust
estimation) and investigate in a simulation study the impact of statistician
choice in PS model and implementation on the degree of between- and
within-design variability in the estimated treatment effect. The methods are
then deployed in an investigation of the association between levels of fine

an observable multi-dimensional random vector into components that are as
statistically independent as possible from each other. Usually the ICA
framework assumes a model according to which the observations are generated
(such as a linear transformation with additive noise). ICA over finite fields
is a special case of ICA in which both the observations and the independent
components are over a finite alphabet. In this thesis we consider a formulation
of the finite-field case in which an observation vector is decomposed to its
independent components (as much as possible) with no prior assumption on the
way it was generated. This generalization is also known as Barlow's minimal
redundancy representation and is considered an open problem. We propose several
theorems and show that this hard problem can be accurately solved with a branch
and bound search tree algorithm, or tightly approximated with a series of
linear problems. Moreover, we show that there exists a simple transformation
(namely, order permutation) which provides a greedy yet very effective
approximation of the optimal solution. We further show that while not every
random vector can be efficiently decomposed into independent components, the
vast majority of vectors do decompose very well (that is, within a small
constant cost), as the dimension increases. In addition, we show that we may
practically achieve this favorable constant cost with a complexity that is
asymptotically linear in the alphabet size. Our contribution provides the first
efficient set of solutions to Barlow's problem with theoretical and
computational guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate our suggested framework in

many fine-grained components. The main cause of such data form is the
component-wise modeling process widely practiced by human modelers. These
modeling components thus inherently reflect some function-based shape
decomposition the artist had in mind during modeling. On the other hand,
modeling components represent an over-segmentation since a functional part is
usually modeled as a multi-component assembly. Based on these observations, we
advocate that labeled segmentation of stock 3D models should not overlook the
modeling components and propose a learning solution to grouping and labeling of
the fine-grained components. However, directly characterizing the shape of
individual components for the purpose of labeling is unreliable, since they can
be arbitrarily tiny and semantically meaningless. We propose to generate part
hypotheses from the components based on a hierarchical grouping strategy, and
perform labeling on those part groups instead of directly on the components.
Part hypotheses are mid-level elements which are more probable to carry
semantic information. A multiscale 3D convolutional neural network is trained
to extract context-aware features for the hypotheses. To accomplish a labeled
segmentation of the whole shape, we formulate higher-order conditional random
fields (CRFs) to infer an optimal label assignment for all components.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significantly robust
labeling results on raw 3D models from public shape repositories. Our work also
contributes the first benchmark for component-wise labeling.

sampling of environmental monitors recording an environmental process across
space and/or time. This is achieved by considering the joint distribution of an
environmental process with a site--selection process that considers where and
when sites are placed to measure the process. The environmental process may be
spatial, temporal or spatio--temporal in nature. By sharing random effects
between the two processes, the joint model is able to establish whether site
placement was stochastically dependent of the environmental process under
study. The embedding into a spatio--temporal framework also allows for the
modelling of the dynamic site---selection process itself. Real--world factors
affecting both the size and location of the network can be easily modelled and
quantified. Depending upon the choice of population of locations to consider
for selection across space and time under the site--selection process,
different insights about the precise nature of preferential sampling can be
obtained. The general framework developed in the paper is designed to be easily
and quickly fit using the R-INLA package. We apply this framework to a case
study involving particulate air pollution over the UK where a major reduction
in the size of a monitoring network through time occurred. It is demonstrated
that a significant response--biased reduction in the air quality monitoring
network occurred. We also show that the network was consistently
unrepresentative of the levels of particulate matter seen across much of GB
throughout the operating life of the network. Finally we show that this may
have led to a severe over-reporting of the population--average exposure levels

functional theory + $U$ study of single-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM)
semiconductor CoS$_2$ with the pentagonal structure forming the so-called Cairo
Tessellation. We find that this single-layer magnet exhibits an indirect
bandgap of 1.06 eV with light electron and hole effective masses of 0.03 and
0.10 $m_0$, respectively, which may lead to high carrier mobilities. The hybrid
density functional theory calculations correct the bandgap to 2.24 eV. We also
compute the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE), showing that the easy
axis of the AFM ordering is out of plane with a sizable MAE of 153 $\mu$eV per
Co ion. We further calculate the magnon frequencies at different spin-spiral
vectors, based on which we estimate the N$\acute{e}$el temperatures to be 20.4

We then apply biaxial strains to tune the bandgap of single-layer pentagonal
CoS$_2$. We find that the energy difference between the ferromagnetic and AFM
structures strongly depends on the biaxial strain, but the ground state remains
the AFM ordering. Although the low critical temperature prohibits the magnetic
applications of single-layer pentagonal CoS$_2$ at room temperature, the
excellent electrical properties may find this novel single-layer semiconductor
applications in optoelectronic nanodevices.

we analyze only the spin-magnetic coupling, as it is linear in $\hbar$ and
consequently it is the strongest spin effect. We re-obtain the classical
two-fluid MHD dispersion relations corresponding to the magnetosonic and

perpendicular propagation, the fast-mode frequency is the same as for the

Single Diffusion Encoding (SDE) to Double Diffusion Encoding (DDE) solves the
ill-posedness and increases the accuracy of the parameter estimation. Methods:
We analyse theoretically the cumulant expansion up to fourth order in b of SDE

and DDE capabilities under similar noise conditions. Results: We prove
analytically that DDE provides invariant information non-accessible from SDE,
which makes the NODDIDA parameter estimation injective. The in silico
experiments show that DDE reduces the bias and mean square error of the

Conclusions: DDE adds additional information for estimating the model

Recent research in the field has tackled this problem by exploiting the
expressiveness of deep convolutional networks. In fact, there is another level
of ambiguity that is often overlooked: among plausible shapes, there are still
multiple shapes that fit the 2D image equally well; i.e., the ground truth
shape is non-deterministic given a single-view input. Existing fully supervised
approaches fail to address this issue, and often produce blurry mean shapes
with smooth surfaces but no fine details.
  In this paper, we propose ShapeHD, pushing the limit of single-view shape
completion and reconstruction by integrating deep generative models with
adversarially learned shape priors. The learned priors serve as a regularizer,
penalizing the model only if its output is unrealistic, not if it deviates from
the ground truth. Our design thus overcomes both levels of ambiguity

Blackwell measure, which is a probability distribution on the unit interval
$[0,1]$ with mean $1/2$. Conversely, any such probability distribution defines
a BIC. The evolution of the Blackwell measure under Arikan's polar transform is
derived for general BICs, and is analogous to density evolution as cited in the
literature. The present analysis emphasizes functional equations. Consequently,
the evolution of a variety of channel functionals is characterized, including
the symmetric capacity, Bhattacharyya parameter, moments of information
density, Hellinger affinity, Gallager's reliability function, the
Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Renyi maximal correlation, and the Bayesian information
gain. The evolution of measure is specialized for symmetric BICs according to
their decomposition into binary symmetric (sub)-channels (BSCs), which
simplifies iterative computations and the construction of polar codes. It is
verified that, as a consequence of the Blackwell--Sherman--Stein theorem, all
channel functionals $\mathrm{I}_f$ that can be expressed as an expectation of a
convex function $f$ with respect to the Blackwell measure of a channel polarize
in each iteration due to the polar transformation on the class of symmetric
BICs. Moreover, for $f$ either convex or non-convex, a necessary and sufficient
condition is established to determine whether the random process associated
with each $\mathrm{I}_f$ is a martingale, submartingale, or supermartingale.
Represented via functional inequalities in terms of $f$, this condition is
numerically verifiable for all $\mathrm{I}_f$, and can generate analytical
proofs. To exhibit one such proof, it is shown that the random process
associated with the squared maximal correlation parameter is a supermartingale,
and converges almost surely on the unit interval $[0,1]$.

clustering groups of cancer patients where each patient (row) is expected to be

can an online algorithm achieve a competitive ratio close to the best
achievable online approximation factor for this problem? We answer this
question affirmatively by giving a polynomial time algorithm that achieves a
$1-1/e-\epsilon -O(k^{-1})$ competitive ratio for any constant $\epsilon > 0$,
using a shortlist of size $\eta_\epsilon(k) = O(k)$. Also, for the special case

methods in conjunction with the recently introduced Windowed Green Function
(WGF) method. As in standard time-domain scattering from bounded obstacles, a
CQ method of the user's choice is utilized to transform the problem into a
finite number of (complex) frequency-domain problems posed on the domains
involving penetrable unbounded interfaces. Each one of the frequency-domain
transmission problems is then formulated as a second-kind integral equation
that is effectively reduced to a bounded interface by means of the WGF

As payments flow over a single channel (link) in the same direction, the

gravitational physics, it is pertinent to develop a systematic method for
switching between the descriptions of physics relative to different choices of
QRFs, which is valid in both fields. Here we continue with such a unifying
approach, begun in arxiv:1809.00556, whose key ingredient is a symmetry
principle, which enforces physics to be relational. Thanks to gauge related
redundancies, this leads to a perspective-neutral structure which contains all
frame choices at once and via which frame perspectives can be consistently
switched. Formulated in the language of constrained systems, the
perspective-neutral structure is the constraint surface classically and the
gauge invariant Hilbert space in the Dirac quantized theory. By contrast, a
perspective relative to a specific frame corresponds to a gauge choice and the
associated reduced phase and Hilbert space. QRF changes thus amount to a gauge
transformation. We show that they take the form of `quantum coordinate
changes'. We illustrate this in a general mechanical model, namely the
relational $N$-body problem in 3D space with rotational and translational
symmetry. This model is especially interesting because it features the Gribov
problem so that globally valid gauge fixing conditions, and hence relational
frame perspectives, are absent. The constraint surface is topologically
non-trivial and foliated by 3-, 5- and 6-dimensional gauge orbits, where the
lower dimensional orbits are a set of measure zero. The $N$-body problem also
does not admit globally valid canonically conjugate pairs of Dirac observables.
These challenges notwithstanding, we exhibit how one can construct the QRF
transformations for the 3-body problem. Our construction also sheds new light
on the generic inequivalence of Dirac and reduced quantization through its
interplay with QRF perspectives.

simulations. We focus on DM haloes and their gas component as well as the
recently predicted supersonically-induced gas objects (SIGOs) that arise as a
result of the stream velocity phase shift. We find that the spin parameter of
the gas component in these first haloes is increased with the stream velocity.
Moreover, we find that when the stream velocity is taken into account, the
angular momentum vectors of the DM component and the gas component are
typically misaligned and this misalignment angle has a nearly isotropic
distribution. The spin parameter value of the gas component is higher than in
the no stream velocity case, which even in the absence of cooling, may result
in more prolate objects. We also generalize the spin parameter to the SIGOs and
find that they typically have a larger spin parameter with respect to their
dark matter counterparts and that there is no correlation of the spin parameter
and the prolateness of such structures. We speculate that SIGOs may be observed
as very low luminosity objects in the early Universe and may serve as potential
progenitors of Little Blue Dot-like systems.

Recent works have pointed to some of the paradoxical consequences of such a
unidirectional range, including in particular the violation of the
time-bandwidth product constraint that should otherwise apply in general in
static systems. Here we show that such a unidirectional frequency range is
nonphysical, using both a general thermodynamic argument, and a detailed
calculation based on a nonlocal hydrodynamic Drude model for the metal

the spectrum is therefore dominated and shaped by only a few sources whose
properties can be inferred from the fine structure of the spectrum at energies
currently accessed by experiments like AMS-02, CALET, DAMPE, Fermi-LAT,
H.E.S.S. and ISS-CREAM. We present a stochastic model of the Galactic
all-electron flux and evaluate its compatibility with the measurement recently
presented by the H.E.S.S. collaboration. To this end, we have MC generated a
large sample of the all-electron flux from an ensemble of random distributions
of sources. We confirm the non-Gaussian nature of the probability density of
fluxes at individual energies previously reported in analytical computations.
For the first time, we also consider the correlations between the fluxes at
different energies, treating the binned spectrum as a random vector and
parametrising its joint distribution with the help of a pair-copula
construction. We show that the spectral break observed in the all-electron
spectrum by H.E.S.S. and DAMPE is statistically compatible with a distribution
of astrophysical sources like supernova remnants or pulsars, but requires a
rate smaller than the canonical supernova rate. This important result provides
an astrophysical interpretation of the spectrum at TeV energies and allows
differentiating astrophysical source models from exotic explanations, like dark
matter annihilation. We also critically assess the reliability of using
catalogues of known sources to model the electron-positron flux.

average variability of a star measured in the power density spectrum in a given
range of frequencies. However, FliPer values calculated on several ranges of
frequency are required to better characterize a star. Using a large set of
asteroseismic targets it is possible to calibrate the behavior of surface
gravity with FliPer through machine learning. This calibration made with a
random forest regressor covers a wide range of surface gravities from
main-sequence stars to subgiants and red giants, with very small uncertainties

seismic pipelines to either give an estimation of the stellar surface gravity

of the source, once corrected for the measured obscuration (L(2-10 keV)~10^{42}

derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes, we test the accuracy of asteroseismic radii
for a sample of 93 dwarfs based on both individual frequency fitting and the
seismic scaling relations. Radii from frequency fitting are about 1 per cent
smaller than Gaia radii on average; however, this difference may be explained
by a negative bias of 30 $\mu$as in the Gaia parallaxes. This indicates that
the radii derived from frequency fitting are accurate to within 1 per cent. The
scaling relations are found to overestimate radii by more than 5 per cent,
compared to the Gaia radii, at the highest temperatures. We demonstrate that
this offset is reduced to 3 per cent after applying corrections based on model
frequencies to the scaling relation for $\Delta\nu$, but only when the model
frequencies are corrected for the surface effect. With corrections to
$\Delta\nu$, the scaling relation gives radii accurate to about 2--3 per cent
for dwarfs in the temperature range $5400$--$6700$ K. The remaining offset at
the highest temperatures may indicate the need for a correction to the scaling

mass, gas-rich dwarfs and internal production from stellar mass loss and/or
cooling from the hot interstellar medium (ISM). We test these hypotheses with
measurements of the stellar and nebular metallicities of three ETGs (NGC 2768,
NGC 3245, and NGC 4694) from new long-slit, high signal-to-noise ratio
spectroscopy from the Multi-Object Double Spectographs (MODs) on the Large

minimal evidence of nuclear activity. We model the stellar continuum to derive
chemical abundances and measure gas-phase abundances with standard nebular
diagnostics. We find that the stellar and gas-phase abundances are very
similar, which supports internal production and is very inconsistent with the
accretion of smaller, lower metallicity dwarfs. All three of these galaxies are
also consistent with an extrapolation of the mass-metallicity relation to
higher mass galaxies with lower specific star formation rates. The emission
line flux ratios along the long-slit, as well as global line ratios clearly
indicate that photoionization dominates and ionization by alternate sources
including AGN activity, shocks, cosmic rays, dissipative magnetohydrodynamic

various ionic metal transitions. By comparing the relative abundances of
different ions in individually-matched components, we show that cool gas (T~1e4

halo. Specifically, metal-poor absorbing components with <1/10 solar
metallicity are seen in 50% of the LRG halos, while gas with solar and
super-solar metallicity is also common. These results indicate a complex
multiphase structure and poor chemical mixing in these quiescent halos. We
calculate the total surface mass density of cool gas, \Sigma_cool, by applying
the estimated ionization fraction corrections to the observed HI column
densities. The radial profile of \Sigma_cool is best-described by a projected
Einasto profile of slope \alpha=1 and scale radius r_s=48 kpc. We find that
typical LRGs at z~0.4 contain cool gas mass of M_cool= (1-2) x1e10 M_sun at

reduction was obtained previously by D'Hoker and Green. In the current work, we
extend these results to trihedral modular graph forms. Doing so involves the
identification of a modular covariant regularization scheme for certain
conditionally convergent sums over discrete momenta, with some elements of the
sum being excluded. The appropriate regularization scheme is identified for any
number of exclusions, which in principle allows one to perform holomorphic
subgraph reduction of higher-point modular graph forms with arbitrary

milestone has been reached by a recent measurement of a finite Chern number

quantum Hall effect in semiconductors are related to the Chern-number
measurement in a cold-atom setup, however, the design and complexity of the two
types of measurements are quite different. Motivated by these recent
developments, we investigate the dynamics of weakly interacting incoherent
bosons in a two-dimensional driven optical lattice exposed to an external
force, which provides a direct probe of the Chern number. We consider a
realistic driving protocol in the regime of high driving frequency and focus on
the role of weak repulsive interactions. We find that interactions lead to the
redistribution of atoms over topological bands both through the conversion of
interaction energy into kinetic energy during the expansion of the atomic cloud
and due to an additional heating. Remarkably, we observe that the moderate
atomic repulsion facilitates the measurement by flattening the distribution of
atoms in the quasi-momentum space. Our results also show that weak interactions
can suppress the contribution of some higher-order non-topological terms in
favor of the topological part of the effective model.

boundary layer or a free stream, say, and the structure of the turbulence is
fixed by the geometry of the experiment. We introduce a new active grid with
many more degrees of freedom than previous active grids. The additional degrees
of freedom make it possible to control various properties of the turbulence. We
show how long-range correlations in the turbulent velocity fluctuations can be
shaped by changing the way the active grid moves. Specifically, we show how not
only the correlation length but also the detailed shape of the correlation
function depends on the correlations imposed in the motions of the grid. Until

the physics of both Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and stellar evolution. For
sufficiently ineffective weak interactions, neutrons do not decay during BBN,
and the baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta$ must be smaller in order for protons to
survive without becoming incorporated into larger nuclei. For stronger weak
interactions, neutrons decay before the onset of BBN, and the early universe is
left with nearly a pure hydrogen composition. We then consider stellar
structure and evolution for the different nuclear compositions resulting from
BBN, a wide range of weak force strengths, and the full range of stellar masses
for a given universe. We delineate the range of this parameter space that
supports working stars, along with a determination of the dominant nuclear
reactions over the different regimes. Deuterium burning dominates the energy
generation in stars when the weak force is sufficiently weak, whereas

force is much stronger than in our universe. Although stars in these universes

geometry. They arise in an elementary fashion as varieties parametrized by
monomials whose exponents are a finite subset $\mathcal{A}$ of $\mathbb{Z}^n$.
They may also be constructed from a rational fan $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
The combinatorics of the set $\mathcal{A}$ or fan $\Sigma$ control the geometry
of the associated toric variety. These toric varieties have an action of an
algebraic torus with a dense orbit. Applications of algebraic geometry in
geometric modeling and algebraic statistics have long studied the nonnegative
real part of a toric variety as the main object, where the set $\mathcal{A}$
may be an arbitrary set in $\mathbb{R}^n$. These are called irrational affine
toric varieties. This theory has been limited by the lack of a construction of
an irrational toric variety from an arbitrary fan in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  We construct a theory of irrational toric varieties associated to arbitrary
fans. These are $(\mathbb{R}_>)^n$-equivariant cell complexes dual to the fan.
Such an irrational toric variety is projective (may be embedded in a simplex)
if and only if its fan is the normal fan of a polytope, and in that case, the
toric variety is homeomorphic to that polytope. We use irrational toric
varieties to show that the space of Hausdorff limits of translates an
irrational toric variety associated to a finite subset $\mathcal{A}$ of

outgassing from their surfaces. Outgassing also produces reactive torques
resulting in cometary spin evolution. We propose that the two processes are
correlated and show that the change of cometary spin rate over its heliocentric
orbit scales linearly with the amplitude of its non-gravitational acceleration.
The proportionality constant depends on the comet size and orbital elements
(semi-major axis and eccentricity) and on the (dimensionless) lever arm
parameter $\zeta$ that relates the outgassing-induced torque and acceleration.
We determine $\zeta$ for 7 comets for which both non-gravitational acceleration
and change of spin period $\Delta P$ were measured and verify this relation.
This sample spanning almost 4 decades in $\Delta P$ yields $\log\zeta=-2.21\pm
0.54$, surprisingly small value and spread. We then apply our framework to 209
comets with measured non-gravitational accelerations and determine the objects
most likely to exhibit large spin period changes, $\Delta P\gtrsim 20$ min per
orbit assuming rotation period of 10 hr and $\zeta$ comparable to our control
sample. These objects should be primary targets for future studies of cometary
spin variability, further constraining distribution of $\zeta$. Lack of comets
with very high expected spin rate changes (which is not equivalent to having
the highest non-gravitational acceleration) suggests that (1) cometary fission
due to outgassing-driven spin-up must be an important process and (2) the

accretion rate, typically finding a moderate variation (f ~ 1.4-2) for
accretion rates between 1% and 100% of the Eddington rate. Consistent with most
previous work, we find f tends to increase with accretion rate, but we also
infer a weaker correlation of f with black holes mass. We find that f is rarely

found when the disk mass surface density is lower than expected for alpha-disk

The Gaia ESA mission will estimate the astrometric and physical data
of more than one billion objects, providing the largest and most precise
catalog of absolute astrometry in the history of Astronomy. The core of this
process, the so-called global sphere reconstruction, is represented by the
reduction of a subset of these objects which will be used to define the
celestial reference frame. As the Hipparcos mission showed, and as is inherent
to all kinds of absolute measurements, possible errors in the data reduction
can hardly be identified from the catalog, thus potentially introducing
systematic errors in all derived work. Aims. Following up on the lessons
learned from Hipparcos, our aim is thus to develop an independent sphere
reconstruction method that contributes to guarantee the quality of the
astrometric results without fully reproducing the main processing chain.
Methods. Indeed, given the unfeasibility of a complete replica of the data
reduction pipeline, an astrometric verification unit (AVU) was instituted by
the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC). One of its jobs is to
implement and operate an independent global sphere reconstruction (GSR),
parallel to the baseline one (AGIS, namely Astrometric Global Iterative
Solution) but limited to the primary stars and for validation purposes, to
compare the two results, and to report on any significant differences. Results.
Tests performed on simulated data show that GSR is able to reproduce at the
sub-$\mu$as level the results of the AGIS demonstration run presented in
Lindegren et al. (2012). Conclusions. Further development is ongoing to improve
on the treatment of real data and on the software modules that compare the AGIS
and GSR solutions to identify possible discrepancies above the tolerance level
set by the accuracy of the Gaia catalog.

  Cyber-Physical Systems",,"Automatica, vol. 113, 2020",,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many Cyber-Physical Systems, we encounter the problem of remote state
estimation of geographically distributed and remote physical processes. This
paper studies the scheduling of sensor transmissions to estimate the states of
multiple remote, dynamic processes. Information from the different sensors have
to be transmitted to a central gateway over a wireless network for monitoring
purposes, where typically fewer wireless channels are available than there are
processes to be monitored. For effective estimation at the gateway, the sensors
need to be scheduled appropriately, i.e., at each time instant one needs to
decide which sensors have network access and which ones do not. To address this
scheduling problem, we formulate an associated Markov decision process (MDP).
This MDP is then solved using a Deep Q-Network, a recent deep reinforcement
learning algorithm that is at once scalable and model-free. We compare our
scheduling algorithm to popular scheduling algorithms such as round-robin and
reduced-waiting-time, among others. Our algorithm is shown to significantly
outperform these algorithms for many example scenarios.

considering up to the fifth nearest neighbors. The results agree reasonably
well with available data from inelastic neutron scattering throughout the

obtaining the maximum amount of data (across multiple vehicles) for a given

the orbit using osculating orbit elements, and analyzes the ""Lagrange planetary

illusory. When the orbital variables in each case are expressed in terms of the

attacks through defensive dropout. Besides using dropout during training for
the best test accuracy, we propose to use dropout also at test time to achieve
strong defense effects. We consider the problem of building robust DNNs as an
attacker-defender two-player game, where the attacker and the defender know
each others' strategies and try to optimize their own strategies towards an
equilibrium. Based on the observations of the effect of test dropout rate on
test accuracy and attack success rate, we propose a defensive dropout algorithm
to determine an optimal test dropout rate given the neural network model and
the attacker's strategy for generating adversarial examples.We also investigate
the mechanism behind the outstanding defense effects achieved by the proposed
defensive dropout. Comparing with stochastic activation pruning (SAP), another
defense method through introducing randomness into the DNN model, we find that
our defensive dropout achieves much larger variances of the gradients, which is
the key for the improved defense effects (much lower attack success rate). For
example, our defensive dropout can reduce the attack success rate from 100% to
13.89% under the currently strongest attack i.e., C&W attack on MNIST dataset.

general energies, covering in particular the 3D Landau-de Gennes model for

known in the isotropic case $W(\nabla u)=\vert \nabla u\vert^2$ and rely on
three ingredients: a monotonicity formula for the scale-invariant energy on
small balls, a uniform pointwise bound, and a Bochner equation for the energy
density. In the level of generality we consider, all of these ingredients are
absent. In particular, the lack of monotonicity formula is an important reason
why optimal estimates on the singular set of $W$-harmonic maps constitute an
open problem. Our novel argument relies on showing appropriate decay for the
energy on small balls, separately at scales smaller and larger than
$\varepsilon$: the former is obtained from the regularity of solutions to
elliptic systems while the latter is inherited from the regularity of
$W$-harmonic maps. This also allows us to handle physically relevant boundary
conditions for which, even in the isotropic case, uniform convergence up to the

underpinned the hardness of Permutational Quantum Computing, a restricted

transition amplitudes of Permutational Quantum Computing model to inverse
polynomial precision on a classical computer is computationally hard. We
disprove the extended version of this conjecture -- even in the case when the
hardness of approximation originated from a difficulty of finding the large

close to the planet where this resonance is present.
  We address the dynamics of the evection resonance, with particular focus on
the Saturn system, and compare the known behavior of the resonance for a single
moon to that of a pair of moons in co-orbital trojan configuration.
  We developed an analytic expansion of the averaged Hamiltonian of a trojan
pair of bodies, including the perturbation from a distant massive body. {The
analysis of the corresponding equilibrium points was restricted to the
asymmetric apsidal corotation solution of the co-orbital dynamics.} We also
performed numerical N-body simulations to construct dynamical maps of the
stability of the evection resonance in the Saturn system, and to study the
effects of this resonance under the migration of trojan moons caused by tidal
dissipation.
  The structure of the phase space of the evection resonance for trojan
satellites is similar to that of a single satellite, differing in that the
libration centers are displaced from their standard positions by an angle that
depends on the periastron difference $\varpi_2-\varpi_1$ and on the mass ratio
$m_2/m_1$ of the trojan pair.
  The interaction with the inner evection resonance may have been relevant
during the early evolution of the Saturn moons Tethys, Dione, and Rhea. In
particular, Rhea may have had trojan companions in the past that were lost when
it crossed the evection resonance, while Tethys and Dione may either have
retained their trojans or have never crossed the evection. This may help to
constrain the dynamical processes that led to the migration of these satellites
and to the evection itself.

self-oscillations in ferromagnets in the spin Hall geometry. The spin current
generated by the spin Hall effect in a bottom nonmagnetic heavy metal excites a
self-oscillation of the magnetization in an attached ferromagnet through
spin-transfer effect. The spin current simultaneously creates spin accumulation
inside the ferromagnet. Therefore, when the top surfaces of two ferromagnets
are connected by a nonmagnetic material having a long spin diffusion length,
another spin current flows according to the gradient of the spin accumulations
between the ferromagnets. This additional spin current excites an additional
spin torque leading to a coupled motion of the magnetizations. This coupling
mechanism comes purely from spin degree of freedom in the system without using
electric and/or magnetic interactions. The additional spin torque acts as a
repulsive force between the magnetizations, and prefers an antiphase
synchronization between the oscillators. The phase difference in a synchronized
state is determined by the competition between this additional spin torque and
spin pumping. Eventually, either an in-phase or antiphase synchronization is
spontaneously excited in the individual ferromagnets, depending on the current
magnitude. These conclusions are obtained by deriving the theoretical formula
of the additional spin torque from the diffusive spin transport theory and
solving the equation of motion of the magnetizations both numerically and
analytically.

run in parallel. However, due to resources shared across cores, such as caches,
distinct processes may interfere with one another, e.g. affecting execution
time. Analysing the extent of this interference is difficult due to: (1) the
diversity of modern architectures, which may contain different implementations
of shared resources, and (2) the complex nature of modern processors, in which
interference might arise due to subtle interactions. To address this, we
propose a black-box auto-tuning approach that searches for processes that are
effective at causing slowdowns for a program when executed in parallel. Such
slowdowns provide lower bounds on worst-case execution time; an important
metric in systems with real-time constraints.
  Our approach considers a set of parameterised ""enemy"" processes and ""victim""
programs, each targeting a shared resource. The autotuner searches for enemy
process parameters that are effective at causing slowdowns in the victim
programs. The idea is that victim programs behave as a proxy for shared
resource usage of arbitrary programs. We evaluate our approach on: 5 different
chips; 3 resources (cache, memory bus, and main memory); and consider several
search strategies and slowdown metrics. Using enemy processes tuned per chip,
we evaluate the slowdowns on the autobench and coremark benchmark suites and
show that our method is able to achieve slowdowns in 98% of benchmark/chip
combinations and provide similar results to manually written enemy processes.

  Fundus Images using Position encoded CNNs","8 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this manuscript, we present a robust method for glaucoma screening from
fundus images using an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The
pipeline comprises of first segmenting the optic disk and optic cup from the
fundus image, then extracting a patch centered around the optic disk and
subsequently feeding to the classification network to differentiate the image
as diseased or healthy. In the segmentation network, apart from the image, we
make use of spatial co-ordinate (X \& Y) space so as to learn the structure of
interest better. The classification network is composed of a DenseNet201 and a
ResNet18 which were pre-trained on a large cohort of natural images. On the
REFUGE validation data (n=400), the segmentation network achieved a dice score
of 0.88 and 0.64 for optic disc and optic cup respectively. For the tasking
differentiating images affected with glaucoma from healthy images, the area
under the ROC curve was observed to be 0.85.

semantic SLAM. Recent studies on object detection and feature extraction have
become important for scene understanding and 3D mapping. However, 3D shape of
the object is too complex to formulate the probabilistic observation model;
therefore, performing the Bayesian inference of the object-oriented features as
well as their pose is less considered. Besides, when the robot equipped with an
RGB mono camera only observes the projected single view of an object, a
significant amount of the 3D shape information is abandoned. Due to these
limitations, semantic SLAM and viewpoint-independent loop closure using
volumetric 3D object shape is challenging. In order to enable the complete
formulation of probabilistic semantic SLAM, we approximate the observation
model of a 3D object with a tractable distribution. We also estimate the
variational likelihood from the 2D image of the object to exploit its observed
single view. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we perform pose and
feature estimation, and demonstrate that the automatic loop closure works
seamlessly without additional loop detector in various environments.

into account the correlation of different wind farms. A multivariate Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) is employed to approximate actual wind speed distributions
from multiple wind farms. Furthermore, we propose to adopt the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique to deliver wind speed samples as the
input of POPF. We also novelly integrate a Sobol-based quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC)
technique into the MCMC sampling process to obtain a faster convergence rate.
The IEEE 14- and 118-bus benchmark systems with additional wind farms are used

an objective function for each pair of images, which can be time-consuming for
large datasets or rich deformation models. In contrast to this approach, and
building on recent learning-based methods, we formulate registration as a
function that maps an input image pair to a deformation field that aligns these
images. We parameterize the function via a convolutional neural network (CNN),
and optimize the parameters of the neural network on a set of images. Given a
new pair of scans, VoxelMorph rapidly computes a deformation field by directly
evaluating the function. In this work, we explore two different training
strategies. In the first (unsupervised) setting, we train the model to maximize
standard image matching objective functions that are based on the image
intensities. In the second setting, we leverage auxiliary segmentations
available in the training data. We demonstrate that the unsupervised model's
accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while operating orders of
magnitude faster. We also show that VoxelMorph trained with auxiliary data
improves registration accuracy at test time, and evaluate the effect of
training set size on registration. Our method promises to speed up medical

computing capabilities away from the centralized cloud to the network edge.
However, with the sinking of computing capabilities, the new challenge incurred
by user mobility arises: since end-users typically move erratically, the
services should be dynamically migrated among multiple edges to maintain the
service performance, i.e., user-perceived latency. Tackling this problem is
non-trivial since frequent service migration would greatly increase the
operational cost. To address this challenge in terms of the performance-cost
trade-off, in this paper we study the mobile edge service performance
optimization problem under long-term cost budget constraint. To address user
mobility which is typically unpredictable, we apply Lyapunov optimization to
decompose the long-term optimization problem into a series of real-time
optimization problems which do not require a priori knowledge such as user
mobility. As the decomposed problem is NP-hard, we first design an
approximation algorithm based on Markov approximation to seek a near-optimal
solution. To make our solution scalable and amenable to future 5G application
scenario with large-scale user devices, we further propose a distributed
approximation scheme with greatly reduced time complexity, based on the
technique of best response update. Rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive
evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed centralized and

remarkable result that certain sparse DNNs can train to the same precision as
dense DNNs at lower runtime and storage cost. An intriguing class of these

to evaluate its environment. Then the relations between galaxy properties, such
as specific star formation rate(sSFR), fraction of star forming galaxies, $g-r$
colour and $\delta_1$ are examined within three galactic samples formed from
galaxies within large clusters, those in the vicinity of large clusters and
those in the field. We find tight environmental correlations for these galaxy
properties. In brief, galaxies in denser environments tend to be redder and are
more likely to be quenched. This is consistent with observations. We find that
although the sSFR decreases with $\delta_1$, this is mainly because that
galaxies with higher stellar mass reside in environment with higher
overdensity. At fixed over-density a galaxy's color is also independent of
whether it lives within a cluster or within the field, but the relative
fractions of the two samples varies dramatically with over-density and this
drives an apparent evolution.

individual self-interested and rational agents that act as suppliers and
consumers is a natural problem in a variety of real-life domains---smart power
grids, data centers, and others. In this paper, we address the
profit-maximization problem for a group of distributed supplier and consumer
agents, with no inter-agent communication. We simulate a scenario of a market
with $S$ suppliers and $C$ consumers such that at every instant, each supplier
agent supplies a certain quantity and simultaneously, each consumer agent
consumes a certain quantity. The information about the total amount supplied
and consumed is only kept with the center. The proposed algorithm is a
combination of the classical additive-increase multiplicative-decrease (AIMD)
algorithm in conjunction with a probabilistic rule for the agents to respond to
a capacity signal. This leads to a nonhomogeneous Markov chain and we show
almost sure convergence of this chain to the social optimum, for our market of
distributed supplier and consumer agents. Employing this AIMD-type algorithm,
the center sends a feedback message to the agents in the supplier side if there
is a scenario of excess supply, or to the consumer agents if there is excess
consumption. Each agent has a concave utility function whose derivative tends
to 0 when an optimum quantity is supplied/consumed. Hence when social
convergence is reached, each agent supplies or consumes a quantity which leads
to its individual maximum profit, without the need of any communication. So
eventually, each agent supplies or consumes a quantity which leads to its
individual maximum profit, without communicating with any other agents. Our
simulations show the efficacy of this approach.

methods have thus been proposed in the recent years, among which the random
features method gains much popularity due to its simplicity and direct
reduction of nonlinear problem to a linear one. The Random Binning (RB)
feature, proposed in the first random-feature paper \cite{rahimi2007random},
has drawn much less attention than the Random Fourier (RF) feature. In this
work, we observe that the RB features, with right choice of optimization
solver, could be orders-of-magnitude more efficient than other random features
and kernel approximation methods under the same requirement of accuracy. We
thus propose the first analysis of RB from the perspective of optimization,
which by interpreting RB as a Randomized Block Coordinate Descent in the
infinite-dimensional space, gives a faster convergence rate compared to that of
other random features. In particular, we show that by drawing $R$ random grids
with at least $\kappa$ number of non-empty bins per grid in expectation, RB
method achieves a convergence rate of $O(1/(\kappa R))$, which not only
sharpens its $O(1/\sqrt{R})$ rate from Monte Carlo analysis, but also shows a
$\kappa$ times speedup over other random features under the same analysis
framework. In addition, we demonstrate another advantage of RB in the
L1-regularized setting, where unlike other random features, a RB-based
Coordinate Descent solver can be parallelized with guaranteed speedup
proportional to $\kappa$. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance of the RB features over other random features and kernel

However, the similar progress in manipulating elastic waves is very slow,
because the elastodynamic equations are not form-invariant. Here we show that
the expression of the elastodynamic potential energy can almost retain its form

the transverse wave velocity, or if the wavelength can be shortened by
converting the waves into surface modes. Based on these findings, it is
possible to design and fabricate novel devices with ease to manipulate elastic

dynamic programming problems, because of the inherent complexity in computing
optimal solutions characterized by Bellman's principle of optimality. A wide
range of approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methods now exists. It is of
great interest to guarantee that the performance of an ADP scheme be at least
some known fraction, say $\beta$, of optimal. This paper introduces a general
approach to bounding the performance of ADP methods, in this sense, in the
stochastic setting. The approach is based on new results for bounding greedy
solutions in string optimization problems, where one has to choose a string
(ordered set) of actions to maximize an objective function. This bounding
technique is inspired by submodularity theory, but submodularity is not
required for establishing bounds. Instead, the bounding is based on quantifying
certain notions of curvature of string functions; the smaller the curvatures
the better the bound. The key insight is that any ADP scheme is a greedy scheme
for some surrogate string objective function that coincides in its optimal
solution and value with those of the original optimal control problem. The ADP
scheme then yields to the bounding technique mentioned above, and the
curvatures of the surrogate objective determine the value $\beta$ of the bound.
The surrogate objective and its curvatures depend on the specific ADP.

today's digital world where it's easy to create and spread a misleading news
article. This is especially true of news stories shared on social media since
they don't undergo any stringent journalistic checking associated with main
stream media. Given the inherent human tendency to share information with their
social connections at a mouse-click, fake news articles masquerading as real
ones, tend to spread widely and virally. The presence of echo chambers (people
sharing same beliefs) in social networks, only adds to this problem of
wide-spread existence of fake news on social media. In this paper, we tackle
the problem of fake news detection from social media by exploiting the very
presence of echo chambers that exist within the social network of users to
obtain an efficient and informative latent representation of the news article.
By modeling the echo-chambers as closely-connected communities within the
social network, we represent a news article as a 3-mode tensor of the structure
- <News, User, Community> and propose a tensor factorization based method to
encode the news article in a latent embedding space preserving the community

Hebbian learning associates multiple items in the brain by converting temporal

experimental evidence suggests that learning of inhibitory synapses creates
""inhibitory engrams"", which presumably balance with the patterns encoded in the
excitatory network. Controlling inhibitory engrams may modify the behavior of
associative memory in neural networks, but the consequence of such control has
not been theoretically understood. Noting that Hebbian learning of inhibitory

the correlated attractors. The balance of targetted and global inhibition
regulates this span of association in the network. Our results suggest a

decades, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has been the most widely adopted

global-alignment kernels have since been proposed in the spirit of DTW to
extend its use to kernel-based estimation method such as support vector
machine. However, those kernels suffer from diagonal dominance of the Gram
matrix and a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the sample size. In this work, we
study a family of alignment-aware positive definite (p.d.) kernels, with its
feature embedding given by a distribution of \emph{Random Warping Series
(RWS)}. The proposed kernel does not suffer from the issue of diagonal
dominance while naturally enjoys a \emph{Random Features} (RF) approximation,
which reduces the computational complexity of existing DTW-based techniques
from quadratic to linear in terms of both the number and the length of
time-series. We also study the convergence of the RF approximation for the
domain of time series of unbounded length. Our extensive experiments on 16
benchmark datasets demonstrate that RWS outperforms or matches state-of-the-art

the inference process through the transformation, but there can be many other

each source block in a pre-trained teacher network to a target block in a
student network. For the recasting, a target block is trained such that its
output activation approximates that of the source block. Such a block-by-block
recasting in a sequential manner transforms the network architecture while
preserving the accuracy. This method can be used to transform an arbitrary
teacher network type to an arbitrary student network type. It can even generate
a mixed-architecture network that consists of two or more types of block. The
network recasting can generate a network with fewer parameters and/or
activations, which reduce the inference time significantly. Naturally, it can
be used for network compression by recasting a trained network into a smaller
network of the same type. Our experiments show that it outperforms previous
compression approaches in terms of actual speedup on a GPU.

resonant enhanced. The suppression and enhancement of the thermoelectric
coefficients will compete with each other as the magnetic impurity potential
increases continually. More interestingly, when a finite charge potential is

making the signs of the ANS and thermopower tunable by the strength of the

of articulation in the context of the computational capabilities of an
underlying processing algorithm. In this paper a mathematical model to capture
and distinguish the latent structure in the articulation of questions is
presented. We propose an objective-driven approach to represent this latent
structure and show that such an approach is beneficial when examples of
complementary objectives are not available. We show that the latent structure
can be represented as a system that maximizes a cost function related to the
underlying objective. Further, we show that the optimization formulation can be
approximated to building a memory of patterns represented as a trained neural
auto-encoder. Experimental evaluation using many clusters of questions, each
related to an objective, shows 80% recognition accuracy and negligible false
positive across these clusters of questions. We then extend the same memory to
a related task where the goal is to iteratively refine a dataset of questions
based on the latent articulation. We also demonstrate a refinement scheme
called K-fingerprints, that achieves nearly 100% recognition with negligible
false positive across the different clusters of questions.

significantly influence the cometary plasma environment at altitudes down to
10-30 km. The ionospheric low-energy \textcolor{black}{($\sim$5 eV) plasma

\textcolor{black}{likely} caused by compression of the plasma environment,
increased particle impact ionisation, and possibly charge exchange processes
and acceleration of mass loaded plasma back to the comet ionosphere. During all
events, the fluxes of suprathermal ($\sim$10-100 eV) electrons increase
significantly, suggesting that the heating mechanism of these electrons is
coupled to the solar wind energy input. At impact the magnetic field strength
in the coma increases by a factor of ~2-5 as more interplanetary magnetic field
piles up around of the comet. During two CIR impact events, we observe possible
plasma boundaries forming, or moving past Rosetta, as the strong solar wind

estimate the probability of a data point by using latent variables. In the VAE,
the posterior of the latent variable given the data point is regularized by the
prior of the latent variable using Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence. Although
the standard Gaussian distribution is usually used for the prior, this simple
prior incurs over-regularization. As a sophisticated prior, the aggregated
posterior has been introduced, which is the expectation of the posterior over
the data distribution. This prior is optimal for the VAE in terms of maximizing
the training objective function. However, KL divergence with the aggregated
posterior cannot be calculated in a closed form, which prevents us from using
this optimal prior. With the proposed method, we introduce the density ratio
trick to estimate this KL divergence without modeling the aggregated posterior
explicitly. Since the density ratio trick does not work well in high
dimensions, we rewrite this KL divergence that contains the high-dimensional
density ratio into the sum of the analytically calculable term and the
low-dimensional density ratio term, to which the density ratio trick is
applied. Experiments on various datasets show that the VAE with this implicit
optimal prior achieves high density estimation performance.

  Shuming Shi","Skeleton-to-Response: Dialogue Generation Guided by Retrieval Memory","accepted to NAACL2019",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For dialogue response generation, traditional generative models generate
responses solely from input queries. Such models rely on insufficient
information for generating a specific response since a certain query could be
answered in multiple ways. Consequentially, those models tend to output generic
and dull responses, impeding the generation of informative utterances.
Recently, researchers have attempted to fill the information gap by exploiting
information retrieval techniques. When generating a response for a current
query, similar dialogues retrieved from the entire training data are considered
as an additional knowledge source. While this may harvest massive information,
the generative models could be overwhelmed, leading to undesirable performance.
In this paper, we propose a new framework which exploits retrieval results via
a skeleton-then-response paradigm. At first, a skeleton is generated by
revising the retrieved responses. Then, a novel generative model uses both the
generated skeleton and the original query for response generation. Experimental
results show that our approaches significantly improve the diversity and
informativeness of the generated responses.

emission, likely originating from an X-ray corona coupled to a radiatively
efficient accretion flow. We find a correlation between the X-ray luminosity
and the radio core luminosity, consistent with that expected for AGNs powered
by efficient accretion. In most sources, the luminosity of the radio lobes and
the estimated jet power are relatively low compared with the nuclear X-ray
emission. This indicates that either the nucleus is more powerful than in the
past, consistent with a restarting of the central engine, or that the giant

where the gravitational energy released from these bodies is the source of
energy. However, if these bodies release energy in the atmosphere instead of at
the surface, this assumption might not be justified. Our aim is to explore the
interactions of infalling planetesimals with primordial atmospheres at an
embedded phase of evolution. We investigate effects of atmospheric interaction
on the planetesimals (mass loss) and the atmosphere (heating/cooling). We used
atmospheric parameters from a snapshot of time-dependent evolution simulations
for embedded atmospheres and simulated purely radial, infall events of
siliceous planetesimals in a 1D, explicit code. We implemented energy transfer
between friction, radiation transfer by the atmosphere and the body and thermal
ablation; this gives us the possibility to examine the effects on the
planetesimals and the atmosphere. We find that a significant amount of
gravitational energy is indeed dissipated into the atmosphere, especially for
larger planetary cores, which consequently cannot contribute to the atmospheric
planetary luminosity. Furthermore, we examine that planetesimal infall events
for cores, $M_\mathrm{C} > 2$M$_{\oplus}$, which actually result in a local
cooling of the atmosphere; this is totally in contradiction with the classical
model.

parameters such as noise levels and spatial resolution. Methods: An ACR phantom
was examined at different radiation dose levels. To characterize the image
texture, two Haralick texture parameters, contrast and entropy, for different
dose level and reconstruction algorithms were assessed. The visual impression
of images and their structural differences were evaluated using the structural
similarity index (SSIM). Noise was determined for all dose and AMIRE levels and
compared to those by filtered back projection (FBP). The spatial resolution was
determined by the modulation transfer functions and the line spread function.
Results: The Haralick texture parameters decreased with increasing ADMIRE
levels I up to V. ADMIRE III, IV and V offered a comparable contrast and
entropy to those calculated by FBP with a radiation dose reduction up to 50%.
SSIM improved with increasing ADMIRE levels. SSIM calculated by ADMIRE IV and V
showed similar values by the filter back projection with a dose decrease up to
50%. Spatial resolution was retained up to 90% dose reduction. With increasing
ADMIRE as well as dose level the noise distribution shifted to a more narrow
distribution, which was in accordance with the reconstructed images using
ADMIRE. Conclusion: Texture analysis and SSIM allow a more realistic assessment
of the dose reduction potential of iterative reconstruction algorithms than
quality metrics only based on physical measurements of noise distribution or
spatial resolution. This work presented that by means of the ADMIRE algorithm,
a comparable image quality at reduced radiation doses can be reached.

Towards that end, it is vital to exploit all degrees of freedom of wireless
networks efficiently, so that service quality is not sacrificed. In order to
reap the benefits of flexible networking, we propose a spatial network
configuration scheme (SNC), which can result in efficient networking; both from
the perspective of network capacity, and profitability. First, SNC utilizes the
drone-base-stations (drone-BSs) to configure access points. Drone-BSs are
shifting paradigms of heterogeneous wireless networks by providing radically
flexible deployment opportunities. On the other hand, their limited endurance
and potential high cost increase the importance of utilizing drone-BSs
efficiently. Therefore, secondly, user mobility is exploited via
user-in-the-loop (UIL), which aims at influencing users' mobility by offering
incentives. The proposed uncoordinated SNC is a computationally efficient
method, yet, it may be insufficient to exploit the synergy between drone-BSs
and UIL. Hence, we propose joint SNC, which increases the performance gain
along with the computational cost. Finally, semi-joint SNC combines benefits of
joint SNC, with computational efficiency. Numerical results show that
semi-joint SNC is two orders of magnitude times faster than joint SNC, and more
than 15 percent profit can be obtained compared to conventional systems.

on the Earth. Secondary neutrinos and photons produced in these interactions
serve as crucial astrophysical messengers of UHECR sources. A modeling of the
latest data obtained by the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) suggests a mixed
element composition of UHECRs with the sub-ankle spectrum being explained by a
different class of sources than the super-ankle region ($> 10^{18.7}$ eV). In
this work, we obtain two kinds of fit to the UHECR spectrum -- one with a
single population of sources comprising of $^1$H and $^2$He, over an energy
range commencing at $\approx 10^{18}$ eV -- another for a mixed composition of
representative nuclei $^1$H, $^4$He, $^{14}$N and $^{28}$Si at injection, for

consider the source emissivity evolution to be a simple power-law in redshift.

over a wide range of values and compare the results to that obtained for
H+He+N+Si composition, using the Monte Carlo simulation tool CRPropa 3. The
secondary electrons and photons are propagated using the cosmic ray transport

of Ba(Ti0.96Sn0.04)O3, which represents a model perovskite system, where the
effects of point defects, stoichiometry imbalance and phase transitions are
minimized by Sn substitution. It was found that different microscopic
mechanisms are responsible for the various grain size dependences observed. In
fine-grained ceramics, high permittivity is due to high domain wall density and
polar nanoregions; high d33 in coarse-grained ceramics results from a high
degree of domain alignment during poling; large electric field-induced strain
in intermediate-grained ceramics is an outcome of a favourable interplay
between constraints from grain boundaries and reversible reorientation of
non-180 degree domains and polar nanoregions. These paradigms can be regarded
as general guidelines for the optimization of specific properties through grain
size control.

convincing extrapolation to celestial bodies.We have run more than 900

precession dynamos rely on the presence of large-scale vortices, and the
surface magnetic fields are dominated by small scales.Interestingly,
intermittent and self-killing dynamos are observed.Our results suggest that
large-scale planetary magnetic fields are unlikely to be produced by a
precession-driven dynamo in a spherical core.But this question remains open as
planetary cores are not exactly spherical, and thus the coupling between the
fluid and the boundary does not vanish in the relevant limit of small
viscosity.Moreover, the fully turbulent dissipation regime has not yet been

domains like spectrum auctions, and speed of convergence is one of the crucial
factors behind the choice of a specific design for practical applications. To
achieve fast convergence, current CAs require careful tuning of the price
update rule to balance convergence speed and allocative efficiency. Brero and
Lahaie (2018) recently introduced a Bayesian iterative auction design for
settings with single-minded bidders. The Bayesian approach allowed them to
incorporate prior knowledge into the price update algorithm, reducing the
number of rounds to convergence with minimal parameter tuning. In this paper,
we generalize their work to settings with no restrictions on bidder valuations.
We introduce a new Bayesian CA design for this general setting which uses Monte
Carlo Expectation Maximization to update prices at each round of the auction.
We evaluate our approach via simulations on CATS instances. Our results show
that our Bayesian CA outperforms even a highly optimized benchmark in terms of
clearing percentage and convergence speed.

dual to the renormalization group flow of a $3D$ Euclidean conformal field
theory with marginally relevant operators. The scalar potential of the $4D$
theory ---in which inflation is realized--- is highly constrained, with use of
the Hamilton--Jacobi equations. In multi-field holographic realizations of
inflation, fields additional to the inflaton cannot display underdamped
oscillations (that is, their wavefunctions contain no oscillatory phases
independent of the momenta). We show that this result is exact, independent of
the number of fields, the field space geometry and the shape of the
inflationary trajectory followed in multi-field space. In the specific case
where the multi-field trajectory is a straight line or confined to a plane, it
can be understood as the existence of an upper bound on the dynamical masses
$m$ of extra fields of the form $m \leq 3 H / 2$ up to slow roll corrections.
This bound corresponds to the analytic continuation of the well known
Breitenlohner--Freedman bound found in AdS spacetimes in the case when the
masses are approximately constant. The absence of underdamped oscillations
implies that a detection of ""cosmological collider"" oscillatory patterns in the
non-Gaussian bispectrum would not only rule out single field inflation, but
also holographic inflation or any inflationary model based on the
Hamilton--Jacobi equations. Hence, future observations have the potential to
exclude, at once, an entire class of inflationary theories, regardless of the
details involved in their model building.

We test the method by considering the paradigmatic case of Zn(II) in water
which, besides being relevant in itself, is also of interest for biology. With
the help of classical molecular dynamics simulations we start by producing
bunches of configurations differing for the Zn(II)-water coordination mode.
Different coordination modes are obtained by making use of the so-called dummy
atoms method. From the collected molecular dynamics trajectories, snapshots of
a more manageable subsystem encompassing the metal site and two solvation
layers are cut out. Density functional theory is used to optimize and relax
these reduced system configurations employing a uniform dielectric to mimic the
surrounding bulk liquid water. On the resulting structures, fully quantum
mechanical X-ray absorption spectra calculations are performed by including
core-hole effects and core-level shifts. The proposed approach does not rely on
any guessing or fitting of the force field or of the atomic positions of the
system. The comparison of the theoretically computed spectrum with the
experimental Zn K-edge XANES data unambiguously demonstrates that among the
different a priori possible geometries, Zn(II) in water lives in an octahedral

parameters in the classical action) are quantum observables in a kinematical
Hilbert space. When all of these observables commute, our proposal differs
little from the treatment given to classical parameters in quantum information
theory, at least if we were to inhabit a constants' eigenstate.
Non-commutativity introduces novelties, due to its associated uncertainty and
complementarity principles, and it may even preclude hamiltonian evolution. The
system typically evolves as a quantum superposition of hamiltonian evolutions
resulting from a diagonalization process, and these are usually quite distinct
from the original one (defined in terms of the non-commuting constants). We
present several examples targeting $G$, $c$ and $\Lambda $, and the dynamics of
homogeneous and isotropic Universes. If we base our construction on the
Heisenberg algebra and the quantum harmonic oscillator, the alternative
dynamics tends to silence matter (effectively setting $G$ to zero), and make
curvature and the cosmological constant act as if their signs are reversed.
Thus, the early Universe expands as a quantum superposition of different Milne
or de Sitter expansions for all material equations of state, even though matter
nominally dominates the density, $\rho $, because of the negligible influence
of $G\rho $ on the dynamics. A superposition of Einstein static universes can
also be obtained. We also investigate the results of basing our construction on
the algebra of $SU(2)$, into which we insert information about the sign of a
constant of Nature, or whether its action is switched on or off. In this case
we find examples displaying quantum superpositions of bounces at the initial

essential component for the success of Reynolds Stress Models in turbulent flow
simulations. However replicating the non-local action of pressure using only
local tensors places a large limitation on potential model performance. In this
thesis we outline an approach that extends the tensor basis used for pressure
strain correlation modeling to formulate models with improved precision and
robustness. This set of additional tensors is analyzed and justified based on
physics based arguments and analysis of simulation data. Using these tensors
models for the rapid and slow pressure strain correlation are developed. The
resulting complete pressure strain correlation model is tested for a wide
variety of turbulent flows, while being contrasted against the predictions of
established models. It is shown that the new model provides significant
improvement in prediction accuracy. In the second stage of the work a series of
experiments on decaying grid generated turbulence and grid turbulence with mean
strain were conducted. Experimental data of turbulence statistics including
Reynolds stress anisotropies is collected, analyzed and then compared to the
predictions of Reynolds Stress Models to assess their accuracy and is used to
evaluate the variability in the coefficients of the rate of dissipation model
and the pressure strain correlation models used in Reynolds Stress Modeling.

Local Area Network (LAN) cabling infrastructure of buildings to distribute
Radio-Frequency (RF) signals indoors. A-MIMO-RoC, by leveraging a fully analog
implementation, completely avoids any dedicated digital interface by using a
transparent end-to-end system, with consequent latency, bandwidth and cost
benefits. Usually, LAN cables are exploited mainly in the low-frequency
spectrum portion, mostly due to the moderate cable attenuation and crosstalk
among twisted-pairs. Unlike current systems based on LAN cables, the key
feature of the proposed platform is to exploit more efficiently the huge
bandwidth capability offered by LAN cables, that contain 4 twisted-pairs
reaching up to 500 MHz bandwidth/pair when the length is below 100 m. Several
works proposed numerical simulations that assert the feasibility of employing
LAN cables for indoor FH applications up to several hundreds of MHz, but an
A-MIMO-RoC experimental evaluation is still missing. Here, we present some
preliminary results obtained with an A-MIMO-RoC prototype made by low-cost
all-analog/all-passive devices along the signal path. This setup demonstrates

algebraic variety associated to the principal ideal generated by the polynomial
$p_{H}$ given as the product of the degree one polynomials which define the
hyperplanes of the arrangement. A finite Borel measure on $R^d$ is bisected by
the arrangement of affine hyperplanes $H$ if the measure on the ""non-negative
side"" of the arrangement $\{x\in R^d : p_{H}(x)\ge 0\}$ is the same as the
measure on the ""non-positive"" side $\{x\in R^d : p_{H}(x)\le 0\}$.
  In 2017 Barba, Pilz \& Schnider considered special cases of the following
measure partition hypothesis: For a given collection of $j$ finite Borel
measures on $R^d$ there exists a $k$-element affine hyperplane arrangement that
bisects each of the measures into equal halves simultaneously. They showed that
there are simultaneous bisections in the case when $d=k=2$ and $j=4$. They
conjectured that every collection of $j$ measures on $R^d$ can be
simultaneously bisected with a $k$-element affine hyperplane arrangement
provided that $d\ge \lceil j/k \rceil$. The conjecture was confirmed in the
case when $d\ge j/k=2^a$ by Hubard and Karasev in 2018.
  In this paper we give a different proof of the Hubard and Karasev result
using the framework of Blagojevi\'c, Frick, Haase \& Ziegler (2016), based on
the equivariant relative obstruction theory of tom Dieck, which was developed
for handling the Gr\""unbaum--Hadwiger--Ramos hyperplane measure partition
problem. Furthermore, this approach allowed us to prove even more, that for
every collection of $2^a(2h+1)+\ell$ measures on $R^{2^a+\ell}$, where $1\leq
\ell\leq 2^a-1$, there exists a $(2h+1)$-element affine hyperplane arrangement
that bisects all of them simultaneously. Our result was extended to the case of
spherical arrangements and reproved by alternative methods in a beautiful way
by Crabb in 2020.

solids by a growing planetary embryo, followed by rapid gas accretion once the
planet exceeds a so-called critical mass. The dominant size of the accreted
solids (cm-size particles named pebbles or km to hundred km-size bodies named
planetesimals) is, however, unknown. Recently, high-precision measurements of
isotopes in meteorites provided evidence for the existence of two reservoirs in
the early Solar System. These reservoirs remained separated from ~1 until ~ 3
Myr after the beginning of the Solar System's formation. This separation is
interpreted as resulting from Jupiter growing and becoming a barrier for
material transport. In this framework, Jupiter reached ~20 Earth masses within
~1 Myr and slowly grew to ~50 Earth masses in the subsequent 2 Myr before
reaching its present-day mass. The evidence that Jupiter slowed down its growth
after reaching 20 Earth masses for at least 2 Myr is puzzling because a planet
of this mass is expected to trigger fast runaway gas accretion. Here, we use
theoretical models to describe the conditions allowing for such a slow
accretion and show that Jupiter grew in three distinct phases. First, rapid
pebble accretion brought the major part of Jupiter's core mass. Second, slow
planetesimal accretion provided the energy required to hinder runaway gas
accretion during 2 Myr. Third, runaway gas accretion proceeded. Both pebbles
and planetesimals therefore have an important role in Jupiter's formation.

approach for transferring grasping skills that accumulates grasping knowledge
into a category-level canonical model. Grasping motions for novel instances of
the category are inferred from geometric deformations between the observed
instance and the canonical shape. Correspondences between the shapes are
established by means of a non-rigid registration method that combines the
Coherent Point Drift approach with subspace methods. By incorporating
category-level information into the registration, we avoid unlikely shapes and
focus on deformations actually observed within the category. Control poses for
generating grasping motions are accumulated in the canonical model from
grasping definitions of known objects. According to the estimated shape
parameters of a novel instance, the control poses are transformed towards it.
The category-level model makes our method particularly relevant for on-line
grasping, where fully-observed objects are not easily available. This is
demonstrated through experiments in which objects with occluded handles are
successfully grasped.

grouped to generate a root code. During synthesis, the root code is decoded,
recursively, to produce a new, coherent part assembly. Assembled shape
structures may be novel, with little global resemblance to training exemplars,

composed of grooves, the top surfaces of the walls (fins) located between
consecutive grooves function as the major source of condensation and the
condensate flows along the fin top into the grooves. Modeling of this
condensation problem is vital for the proper estimation of condensation heat
transfer, which constitutes the basis for the overall performance of an heat

methodology is developed to model the condensation and associated liquid flow

model evaluations, fast surrogate models based on generalized Polynomial Chaos
(gPC) and Gaussian Process are used to identify the key parameters affecting
topology and size of burnt area. This study investigates the application of
these surrogates to compute Sobol' sensitivity indices in an idealized test
case. The wind is known to drive the fire propagation. The results show that it
is a more general leading factor that governs the generation of secondary
fires. This study also compares the performance of the surrogates for varying
size and type of training sets as well as for varying parameterization and
choice of algorithms. The best performance was achieved using a gPC strategy
based on a sparse least-angle regression (LAR) and a low-discrepancy Halton's
sequence. Still, the LAR-based gPC surrogate tends to filter out the
information coming from parameters with large length-scale, which is not the
case of the cleaning-based gPC surrogate. For both algorithms, sparsity ensures
a surrogate can be built using an affordable number of forward model
evaluations, while the model response is highly multi-scale and nonlinear.
Using a sparse surrogate is thus a promising strategy to analyze new models and
its dependency on input parameters in wildfire applications.

galaxies are by definition in an active evolution stage that might involve
large-scale blowouts and/or cold-mode accretion (infall) from the intergalactic
medium (IGM). We discuss rest-frame UV spectra of four redshift 2-3 quasars
selected to have low-ionisation AALs of SiII or CII that place unique density
and distance constraints on the absorbers. Our analysis of the AALs yields the
following results. One of the quasars, Q0119$-$046, has a rich complex of 11
AAL systems that appear to be infalling at measured speeds from $\sim$0 to
$\sim$1150 km s$^{-1}$ at distance $\sim$5.7 kpc from the quasar. The range of
ions detected, up to NeVIII, indicates a wide range of densities from $\sim$4
to $\sim$2500 cm$^{-3}$. Partial covering the quasar emission source requires
cloud sizes $<$1 pc and possibly $<$0.01 pc. The short dissipation times of
these small clouds suggests that they are created in situ at their observed
location, perhaps as dense condensations in cold-mode accreting gas from IGM.
The AALs in the other three quasars have outflow speeds from $\sim$1900 to
$\sim$3000 km s$^{-1}$. Some of them also appear to have a range of densities
based on the range of ions detected, including MgI $\lambda$2853 in Q0105+061.
However, the absence of excited-state AALs yields only upper limits on their
gas densities ($\lesssim150$ cm$^{-3}$) and large minimum distances
($\gtrsim$40 kpc) from the quasars. These AALs might represent highly extended
quasar-driven outflows, although their actual physical relationships to the
quasars cannot be established.

challenges, we propose a a unified MA scheme for future cellular networks,
which we refer to as structured multiuser superposition transmission (S-MUST).
In S-MUST, we apply complex power allocation coefficients (CPACs) over
multiuser legacy constellations to generate a composite constellation. In
particular, the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of the legacy
constellation of each user are separately multiplied by those of the CPACs. As
such, the CPACs offer an extra degree of freedom for multiplexing users and
guarantee fairness in symmetric broadcast channels. This new paradigm of
superposition coding allows us to design IQ separation at the user side, which
significantly reduces the decoding complexity without degrading performance.
Hence, it supports low-complexity frequency-selective scheduling that does not
entail dynamically switching between MUST and OMA. We further propose to
quantize the CPACs into complex numbers where I and Q components of each
quantized coefficient are primes, facilitating parallel interference
cancellation at each user via modulo operations, last but not least, we
generalize the design of S-MUST to exploit the capabilities of multiantenna
base stations. The proposed S-MUST exhibits an improved user fairness with
respect to conventional MUST (134% spectral efficiency enhancement) and a lower

possibility in the popular setup of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM). It has been shown that such a scenario known as NonHolomorphic
Supersymmetric Standard Model (NHSSM) could remain `natural' ( i.e., not
fine-tuned) even in the presence of a rather heavy higgsino-like LSP. However,
it turns out that distinguishing such a scenario from the MSSM is unlikely to
be an easy task, in particular at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In a first
study of such a scenario at colliders (LHC), we explore a possible way that
focuses on the sbottom phenomenology. This exploits the usual
$\tan\beta$-dependence (enhancement) of the bottom Yukawa coupling but
reinforced/altered in the presence of non-vanishing nonholomorphic soft
trilinear parameter $A_b^{\prime}$. For a given set of masses of the sbottom(s)
and the light electroweakinos (LSP, lighter chargino etc.) which are known from
experiments, the difference between the two scenarios could manifest itself via
event rate in the 2b-jets + ${\, \not \! \! E_T}$ final state, which could be
characteristically different from its MSSM expectation. Impact on the
phenomenology of the stops at the LHC is also touched upon.

(TASEP) in which particles hopping along a lattice can be blocked by obstacles
that dynamically attach/detach from lattice sites. The model can be thought as
TASEP with site-wise dynamic disorder. We consider two versions of defect
dynamics: (i) defects can bind to any site, irrespective of particle
occupation, (ii) defects only bind to sites which are not occupied by particles
(particle-obstacle exclusion). In case (i) there is a symmetric, parabolic-like
relationship between the current and particle density, as in the standard
TASEP. Case (ii) leads to a skewed relationship for slow defect dynamics. We
also show that the presence of defects induces particle clustering, despite the
translation invariance of the system. For open boundaries the same three phases
as for the standard TASEP are observed, albeit the position of phase boundaries
is affected by the presence of obstacles. We develop a simple mean-field theory
that captures the model's quantitative behaviour for periodic and open boundary
conditions and yields good estimates for the current-density relationship, mean
cluster sizes and phase boundaries. Lastly, we discuss an application of the
model to the biological process of gene transcription.

the root can even be a repulsive root for a fixed point method like the Newton

given are not satisfactory. Numerical methods allowing a local convergence
analysis work often under specific hypotheses. This viewpoint favouring
numerical analysis forgets the geometry and the structure of the local algebra.
Thus appeared so-called symbolic-numeric methods, yet full of lessons, but
their precise numerical analysis is still missing. We propose in this paper a
method of symbolic-numeric kind, whose numerical treatment is certified. The
general idea is to construct a finite sequence of systems, admitting the same
root, and called the deflation sequence, so that the multiplicity of the root
drops strictly between two successive systems. So the root becomes regular.
Then we can extract a regular square system we call deflated system. We
described already the construction of this deflated sequence when the singular
root is known. The originality of this paper consists on one hand to construct
a deflation sequence from a point close to the root and on the other hand to
give a numerical analysis of this method. Analytic square integrable functions
build the functional frame. Using the Bergman kernel, reproducing kernel of
this functional frame, we are able to give a $\alpha$-theory {\`a} la Smale.
Furthermore we present new results on the determination of the numerical rank
of a matrix and the closeness to zero of the evaluation map. As an important
consequence we give an algorithm computing a deflation sequence free of
$\epsilon$, threshold quantity measuring the numerical approximation, meaning
that the entry of this algorithm does not involve the variable $\epsilon$.

screen the built-in electric field during growth in a non-uniform, yet

distributed approach requires cooperation of all local controllers, when some
of them do not comply with the distributed algorithm that is applied to the
system, the performance of the system might be compromised. Specifically, it is
considered that adversarial agents (microgrids with their controllers) might
implement control inputs that are different than the ones obtained from the
distributed algorithm. By performing such behavior, these agents might have
better performance at the expense of deteriorating the performance of the
regular agents. This paper proposes a methodology to deal with this type of
adversarial agents such that we can still guarantee that the regular agents can
still obtain feasible, though suboptimal, control inputs in the presence of
adversarial behaviors. The methodology consists of two steps: (i) the
robustification of the underlying optimization problem and (ii) the
identification of adversarial agents, which uses hypothesis testing with
Bayesian inference and requires to solve a local mixed-integer optimization
problem. Furthermore, the proposed methodology also prevents the regular agents
to be affected by the adversaries once the adversarial agents are identified.
In addition, we also provide a sub-optimality certificate of the proposed
methodology.

hypervolume improvement to the case where the hypervolume of the dominated
region is defined using an absolutely continuous measure instead of the
Lebesgue measure. The EWHI criterion takes the form of an integral for which no
closed form expression exists in the general case. To deal with its

a sample approximately distributed from this density. The ability of the
criterion to produce optimization strategies oriented by user preferences is
demonstrated on a simple bi-objective test problem in the cases of a preference
for one objective and of a preference for certain regions of the Pareto front.

quantum entanglement verification become hard to carry out in such cases. Here

(IRAS 20503+6006). This was done using SOFIA HAWC+ dust thermal emission
polarimetry (TEP) at 216 um in combination with Mimir near-infrared background
starlight polarimetry (BSP) conducted at H-band (1.6 um) and K-band (2.2 um).
These observations were augmented with published I-band (0.77 um) BSP and
Planck 850 um TEP to probe B-field orientations with offset from the YSO in a
range spanning 6000 AU to 3 pc. No strong B-field orientation change with
offset was found, indicating remarkable uniformity of the B-field from the
cloud edge to the YSO environs. This finding disagrees with weak-field models
of cloud core and YSO formation. The continuity of inferred B-field
orientations for both TEP and BSP probes is strong evidence that both are
sampling a common B-field that uniformly threads the cloud, core, and YSO
region. Bayesian analysis of Gaia DR2 stars matched to the Mimir BSP stars
finds a distance to GF 9 of 270 +/- 10 pc. No strong wavelength dependence of
B-field orientation angle was found, contrary to previous claims.

line of centres, valid at all separations. This goes beyond the applicable
range of existing solutions for singular hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) which,
for practical applications, are limited to the near-contact or far field region
of the flow. For the normal component of the HI, by use of a bipolar coordinate
system, we derive the stream function for the flow as $Re\to 0$ and a formula
for the singular (squeeze) force between the spheres as an infinite series. We
also obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the forces as the nondimensional
separation between the spheres goes to zero and infinity, rigorously confirming
and improving upon known results relevant to a widely accepted lubrication
theory. Additionally, we recover the force on a sphere moving perpendicularly
to a plane as a special case. For the tangential component, again by using a
bipolar coordinate system, we obtain the corresponding infinite series
expression of the (shear) singular force between the spheres. All results hold
for retreating spheres, consistent with the reversibility of Stokes flow. We
demonstrate substantial differences in numerical simulations of colloidal
fluids when using the present theory compared with existing multipole methods.
Furthermore, we show that the present theory preserves positive definiteness of
the resistance matrix $\boldsymbol{R}$ in a number of situations in which
positivity is destroyed for multipole/perturbative methods.

this gap here we propose a voltage gating model that treats the S4 segment as a
Brownian particle moving through a gating channel pore and adjacent internal
and external vestibules.In our model charges on the S4 segment are screened by
charged residues localized on the other segments of the channel protein, and by
ions present in the vestibules, whose dynamics is assessed using a flux
conservation equation. The electrostatic voltage spatial profile is
consistently assessed by applying the Poisson equation to all the charges
present in the system. The treatment of the S4 segment as a Brownian particle
allows to alternatively describe the dynamics of a single S4 segment, using the
Langevin stochastic differential equation, or the behavior of a population of
S4 segments, useful to assess the macroscopic gating current, using the
Fokker-Planck equation. The proposed model confirms the gating charge transfer
hypothesis, with the movement of the S4 segment among 5 different stable
positions where the gating charges differently interact with the negatively
charged residues on the channel protein. This behavior results in macroscopic
gating currents displaying properties quite similar to those experimentally
found, including a very fast component followed by a slower one with an evident
rising phase at high depolarizing voltages.

are an exciting class of material as their spin chirality can introduce a Berry
phase in the electronic scattering and lead to exotic electronic phenomena such
as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE).
  This study presents a reexamination of the magnetic properties of
Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, a metallic ferromagnet, based on the 2-dimensional kagome bilayer
structure. Previously thought of as a conventional ferromagnet, we show using a
combination of SQUID measurements, symmetry analysis and powder neutron
diffraction, that Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ is a frustrated ferromagnet with a
temperature-dependent non-collinear spin structure. The complexity of the
magnetic interactions is further evidenced by a re-entrant spin glass
transition ($T_f\simeq80$\,K) at temperatures far below the main ferromagnetic
transition ($T\mathrm{_C}$ = 640\,K).
  Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ therefore provides a rare example of a frustrated itinerant
ferromagnet. Further, as well as being of great fundamental interest our
studies highlight the potential of Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ for practical application in
spintronics technology, as the AHE arising from the ferromagnetism in this
material is expected to be enhanced by the coupling between the conduction
electrons and the non-trivial magnetic structure over an exceptionally wide
temperature range.

key component in almost every modern computing system. The increased popularity
of DL applications deployed on a wide-spectrum of platforms have resulted in a
plethora of design challenges related to the constraints introduced by the
hardware itself. What is the latency or energy cost for an inference made by a
Deep Neural Network (DNN)? Is it possible to predict this latency or energy
consumption before a model is trained? If yes, how can machine learners take
advantage of these models to design the hardware-optimal DNN for deployment?
From lengthening battery life of mobile devices to reducing the runtime
requirements of DL models executing in the cloud, the answers to these
questions have drawn significant attention.
  One cannot optimize what isn't properly modeled. Therefore, it is important
to understand the hardware efficiency of DL models during serving for making an
inference, before even training the model. This key observation has motivated
the use of predictive models to capture the hardware performance or energy
efficiency of DL applications. Furthermore, DL practitioners are challenged
with the task of designing the DNN model, i.e., of tuning the hyper-parameters
of the DNN architecture, while optimizing for both accuracy of the DL model and
its hardware efficiency. Therefore, state-of-the-art methodologies have
proposed hardware-aware hyper-parameter optimization techniques. In this paper,
we provide a comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art work and selected
results on the hardware-aware modeling and optimization for DL applications. We
also highlight several open questions that are poised to give rise to novel
hardware-aware designs in the next few years, as DL applications continue to

Feynman diagrams, namely, the ladder and crossed-ladder contributions. For
ground-state interactions, we match the contribution of six of the time-ordered
diagrams against the corresponding Feynman diagrams, showing the consistency of
the two approaches. Second, we also examine the leading radiative correction to
the long-range interaction, which is of relative order O(alpha^3). In doing so,
we uncover logarithmic terms, in both the interatomic distance as well as the
fine-structure constant, in higher-order corrections to the Casimir-Polder
interaction.

define the Damping Reduction as the mapping from the equations of motion of the

obtention of these equations we use the Hamilton's principle (closed dynamics)

commutativity of the branches Legendre transform + Damping Reduction and
Damping Reduction+Legendre transform, where the Legendre transform is the usual

commutativity provides interesting insight about the resulting integrators.
More concretely, Discrete Damping Reduction yields particular numerical schemes
for linearly damped systems which are not symplectic anymore, but preserve some
of the features of their symplectic counterparts from which they proceed (for

illustrated with the examples of the heat bath and transmission lines. In the

reflection of incident light, Schottky-barrier and ohmic front electrodes, an
n-doped InGaN wafer, and a metallic periodically corrugated back-reflector
(PCBR). The ratio of indium to gallium in the wafer varies periodically
throughout the thickness of the absorbing layer of the solar cell. Thus, the
resulting InGaN wafer's optical and electrical properties are made to vary
periodically. This material nonhomogeneity could be physically achieved by
varying the fractional composition of indium and gallium during deposition.
Empirical models for indium nitride and gallium nitride were combined using
Vegard's law to determine the optical and electrical constitutive properties of
the alloy. The nonhomogeneity of the electrical properties of the InGaN aids in
the separation of the excited electron-hole pairs, while the periodicities of
optical properties and the back-reflector enable the incident light to couple
to multiple guided wave modes. The profile of the resulting
charge-carrier-generation rate when the solar cell is illuminated by the AM1.5G

steady-state drift-diffusion equations were solved using COMSOL, which employs
finite-volume methods, to calculate the current density as a function of the
voltage. Mid-band Shockley-Read-Hall, Auger, and radiative recombination rates

study the effects of the solar-cell geometry and the shape of the periodic

their single photo-electron resolution is lost are discussed. Due to the
important similarity in the operation below the breakdown voltage, also older
studies on radiadion damage of avalange photodiodes (APD) are reviewed.
Finally, ideas are presented on how to approach the development of radiation
hard SiPMs in the future.

built upon the ground truth utterances of datasets learn grammar and structure
rules of words and sentences (the latter in the case of continuous speech).
However, visual co-articulation effects in visual speech signals damage the
performance of visual speech LM's as visually, people do not utter what the
language model expects. These models are commonplace but while higher-order
N-gram LM's may improve classification rates, the cost of this model is
disproportionate to the common goal of developing more accurate classifiers. So
we compare which unit would best optimize a lipreading (visual speech) LM to
observe their limitations. We compare three units; visemes (visual speech
units) \cite{lan2010improving}, phonemes (audible speech units), and words.

partition shape, in analogy with the strong and weak Bruhat orders on
permutations. Both posets are ranked by the major index statistic offset by a
fixed shift. The existence of such ranked poset structures allows us to
classify the realizable major index statistics on standard tableaux of
arbitrary straight shape and certain skew shapes. By a theorem of
Lusztig--Stanley, this classification can be interpreted as determining which
irreducible representations of the symmetric group exist in which homogeneous
components of the corresponding coinvariant algebra, strengthening a recent
result of the third author for the modular major index. Our approach is to
identify patterns in standard tableaux that allow one to mutate descent sets in
a controlled manner. By work of Lusztig and Stembridge, the arguments extend to
a classification of all nonzero fake degrees of coinvariant algebras for finite
complex reflection groups in the infinite family of Shephard--Todd groups.

vortices in hydrodynamics. In two dimensions, Kirchhoff equations are used to
demonstrate the solution to single particle Laughlin wave function as complex
Hermite polynomials. We also show that the equation for optical vortices, a two
dimentional system, is derived from Kirchhoff equation by using paraxial wave
approximation. These Kirchhoff equations satisfy a Poisson bracket relationship
in phase space which is identical to the Heisenberg uncertainty relationship.
Therefore, we conclude that being classical equations, the Kirchhoff equations,
describe both a particle and a wave nature of single particle quantum mechanics

the currently available metrics focus on measuring the quality of shots only.
To help bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach to measure players'

measures the expected impact of each pass on the scoreline.

full-field experimental procedure for reliable and accurate identification of
material parameters. It is based on the correlation of a series of images
captured during a mechanical experiment, that are matched by displacement
fields derived from an underlying mechanical model. In recent studies, it has
been shown that when the applied boundary conditions lie outside the employed
field of view, IDIC suffers from inaccuracies. A typical example is a
micromechanical parameter identification inside a Microstructural Volume
Element (MVE), whereby images are usually obtained by electron microscopy or
other microscopy techniques but the loads are applied at a much larger scale.
For any IDIC model, MVE boundary conditions still need to be specified, and any
deviation or fluctuation in these boundary conditions may significantly
influence the quality of identification. Prescribing proper boundary conditions
is generally a challenging task, because the MVE has no free boundary, and the
boundary displacements are typically highly heterogeneous due to the underlying
microstructure. The aim of this paper is therefore first to quantify the
effects of errors in the prescribed boundary conditions on the accuracy of the
identification in a systematic way. To this end, three kinds of mechanical
tests, each for various levels of material contrast ratios and levels of image
noise, are carried out by means of virtual experiments. For simplicity, an
elastic compressible Neo-Hookean constitutive model under plane strain
assumption is adopted. It is shown that a high level of detail is required in
the applied boundary conditions. This motivates an improved boundary condition
application approach, which considers constitutive material parameters as well
as kinematic variables at the boundary of the entire MVE as degrees of freedom
