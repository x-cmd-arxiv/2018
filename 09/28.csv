several new mathematical properties of the special functions occurring in a

single-phonon processes, by including two-phonon processes in which two phonons
are simultaneously absorbed or emitted during impurity scattering [Shchadilova

a multimode squeezed state instead of the multimode coherent state in the
static Frohlich model. We solve the system exactly by applying the generalized
Bogoliubov transformation, an approach that can be straightforwardly adapted to
higher dimensions. Using our exact solution, we obtain a polaron energy free of
infrared divergences and construct analytically the polaron phase diagram. We
find that the repulsive polaron is stable on the positive side of the
impurity-boson interaction but is always thermodynamically unstable on the
negative side of the impurity-boson interaction, featuring a bound state, whose
binding energy we obtain analytically. We find that the attractive polaron is
always dynamically unstable, featuring a pair of imaginary energies which we
obtain analytically. We expect the multimode squeezed state to help with
studies that go not only beyond the Frohlich paradigm but also beyond
Bogoliubov theory, just as the multimode coherent state has helped with the

model's accuracy. While ordinary differential equations are widely used for
their simplicity, they incorporate an exponential distribution for time spent
exposed or infectious. This allows for a high probability of unrealistically
short exposed and infectious time periods. We propose that caution must be
taken when applying intervention methods to basic models in order to avoid
inaccurate predictions. Delay differential equations, which use a delta
distribution for exposed and infectious periods, can provide better realism but
are more difficult to use and analyze. We introduce a multi-infected
compartment model to interpolate between an ODE model with exponential
distributions and a DDE model with delta distributions in order to investigate
the effect these distributions have on the dynamics of the system when an
intervention method is also included. Using steady state stability and
bifurcation analysis, this paper considers when simpler infectious disease
models can be used versus when more realistic time periods must be
incorporated. We find that the placement of control measures on subpopulations
and the length of the time delay impacts the accuracy of the simpler models.

theories, which encompasses all physical models whose predictive power obeys
minimal requirements. The bias of an XOR game under local or global strategies
is shown to be given by a certain injective or projective tensor norm,
respectively. The intrinsic (i.e.\ model-independent) advantage of global over
local strategies is thus connected to a universal function $r(n,m)$ called
'projective-injective ratio'. This is defined as the minimal constant $\rho$
such that $\|\cdot\|_{X\otimes_\pi Y}\leq\rho\,\|\cdot\|_{X\otimes_\varepsilon
Y}$ holds for all Banach spaces of dimensions $\dim X=n$ and $\dim Y=m$, where
$X\otimes_\pi Y$ and $X \otimes_\varepsilon Y$ are the projective and injective
tensor products. By requiring that $X=Y$, one obtains a symmetrised version of
the above ratio, denoted by $r_s(n)$. We prove that $r(n,m)\geq 19/18$ for all
$n,m\geq 2$, implying that injective and projective tensor products are never
isometric. We then study the asymptotic behaviour of $r(n,m)$ and $r_s(n)$,
showing that, up to log factors: $r_s(n)$ is of the order $\sqrt{n}$ (which is
sharp); $r(n,n)$ is at least of the order $n^{1/6}$; and $r(n,m)$ grows at
least as $\min\{n,m\}^{1/8}$. These results constitute our main contribution to
the theory of tensor norms. In our proof, a crucial role is played by an
'$\ell_1$/$\ell_2$/$\ell_{\infty}$ trichotomy theorem' based on ideas by
Pisier, Rudelson, Szarek, and Tomczak-Jaegermann. The main operational
consequence we draw is that there is a universal gap between local and global
strategies in general XOR games, and that this grows as a power of the minimal
local dimension. In the quantum case, we are able to determine this gap up to
universal constants. As a corollary, we obtain an improved bound on the scaling
of the maximal quantum data hiding efficiency against local measurements.

production. Magnetization is calculated from the expected value of a
thermodynamic ensemble of quantized spin waves based on the Heisenberg spin
model applied to an ensemble of coupled harmonic oscillators. A realistic
energy landscape is obtained from a magnon dispersion relation calculated using
spin-density-functional-theory. The equilibrium magnetization as well as the
evolution of magnetization from a non-equilibrium state to equilibrium are
calculated from the path of steepest entropy ascent determined from the SEAQT
equation of motion in state space. The framework makes it possible to model the
temperature- and time-dependence of magnetization without a detailed
description of magnetic damping. The approach is also used to define intensive
properties (temperature and magnetic field strength) that are fundamentally,

calculate the equilibrium magnetization at different temperatures and external

be subject to certain constraints. In the case of inteferometric displacement
measurements, these restrictions impose a 'standard quantum limit' (SQL), which
optimally balances the precision of a measurement with its unwanted backaction.
To go beyond this limit, one must devise more sophisticated measurement
techniques, which either 'evade' the backaction of the measurement, or achieve
clever cancellation of the unwanted noise at the detector. In the half-century
since the SQL was established, systems ranging from LIGO to ultracold atoms and
nanomechanical devices have pushed displacement measurements towards this
limit, and a variety of sub-SQL techniques have been tested in
proof-of-principle experiments. However, to-date, no experimental system has
successfully demonstrated an interferometric displacement measurement with
sensitivity (including all relevant noise sources: thermal, backaction, and
imprecision) below the SQL. Here, we exploit strong quantum correlations in an
ultracoherent optomechanical system to demonstrate off-resonant force and
displacement sensitivity reaching 1.5dB below the SQL. This achieves an
outstanding goal in mechanical quantum sensing, and further enhances the
prospects of using such devices for state-of-the-art force sensing

of true lifelong learning is that artificial neural networks quickly or
catastrophically forget previously learned tasks when trained on a new one.
Numerous methods for alleviating catastrophic forgetting are currently being
proposed, but differences in evaluation protocols make it difficult to directly
compare their performance. To enable more meaningful comparisons, here we
identified three distinct scenarios for continual learning based on whether
task identity is known and, if it is not, whether it needs to be inferred.
Performing the split and permuted MNIST task protocols according to each of
these scenarios, we found that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic
weight consolidation) failed when task identity needed to be inferred. In
contrast, generative replay combined with distillation (i.e., using class
probabilities as ""soft targets"") achieved superior performance in all three
scenarios. Addressing the issue of efficiency, we reduced the computational
cost of generative replay by integrating the generative model into the main
model by equipping it with generative feedback or backward connections. This
Replay-through-Feedback approach substantially shortened training time with no
or negligible loss in performance. We believe this to be an important first
step towards making the powerful technique of generative replay scalable to
real-world continual learning applications.

two properties persist in a neighborhood of 0 which agrees either with the
whole real line or with an open negative half-line; and in this last case, the
ED fails at the right end value. The properties of ED and of global existence
of $M^+$ are fundamental to guarantee the solvability of classical minimization
problems given by linear-quadratic control processes.

material, as it self-assembles into an effective junction array with a
remarkably high kinetic inductance, and its fabrication can be in-situ

that regulate the effect of a treatment on a response variable. While there has
been significant research on this classical topic, little work has been done
when the set of potential mediators is high-dimensional (HD). A further
complication arises when these mediators are interrelated (with unknown
dependencies). In particular, we assume that the causal structure of the
treatment, the confounders, the potential mediators and the response is a
(possibly unknown) directed acyclic graph (DAG). HD DAG models have previously
been used for the estimation of causal effects from observational data. In
particular, methods called IDA and joint-IDA have been developed for estimating
the effects of single and multiple simultaneous interventions, respectively. In
this paper, we propose an IDA-type method called MIDA for estimating so-called
individual mediation effects from HD observational data. Although IDA and
joint-IDA estimators have been shown to be consistent in certain sparse HD
settings, their asymptotic properties such as convergence in distribution and
inferential tools in such settings have remained unknown. In this paper, we
prove HD consistency of MIDA for linear structural equation models with
sub-Gaussian errors. More importantly, we derive distributional convergence
results for MIDA in similar HD settings, which are applicable to IDA and
joint-IDA estimators as well. To our knowledge, these are the first such
distributional convergence results facilitating inference for IDA-type
estimators. These are built on our novel theoretical results regarding uniform
bounds for linear regression estimators over varying subsets of HD covariates
which may be of independent interest. Finally, we empirically validate our
asymptotic theory for MIDA and demonstrate its usefulness via simulations and a
real data application.

and important within distributed systems. We here address not only the formal
modelling of these algorithms, but also the formal verification of their
behaviour. Of particular importance is the strong link between the very
different levels of abstraction at which the algorithms may be verified. Our
contribution is primarily the formalisation of this connection between
individual models and population-based models, and the subsequent verification
that is then possible. While the technique is applicable across a range of
synchronisation algorithms, we particularly focus on the synchronisation of
(biologically-inspired) pulse-coupled oscillators, a widely used approach in
practical distributed systems. For this application domain, different levels of
abstraction are crucial: models based on the behaviour of an individual process
are able to capture the details of distinguished nodes in possibly heterogenous
networks, where each node may exhibit different behaviour. On the other hand,
collective models assume homogeneous sets of processes, and allow the behaviour
of the network to be analysed at the global level. System-wide parameters may
be easily adjusted, for example environmental factors inhibiting the
reliability of the shared communication medium. This work provides a formal
bridge across the abstraction gap separating the individual models and the
population-based models for this important class of synchronisation algorithms.

described by the inversion of bands with relative angular momentum higher than
1. A band inversion of this kind, which is protected by rotation symmetry,
separates the trivial insulator from a Chern insulating phase with higher Chern
number, and thus generalizes the quantum Hall transition described by a Dirac
fermion. Higher angular momentum band inversions are of special interest, as
the non-vanishing density of states at the transition can give rise to
interesting many-body effects. Here we introduce a series of minimal lattice
models which realize higher angular momentum band inversions. We then consider
the effect of interactions, focusing on the possibility of electron-hole
exciton condensation, which breaks rotational symmetry. An analysis of the
excitonic insulator mean field theory further reveals that the ground state of
the Chern insulating phase with higher Chern number has the structure of a
multicomponent integer quantum Hall state. We conclude by generalizing the
notion of higher angular momentum band inversions to the class time-reversal
invariant systems, following the scheme of Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ). Such
band inversions can be viewed as transitions to a topological insulator
protected by rotation and inversion symmetry, and provide a promising venue for

by the recognition principle, which arise from Voevodsky's computation of the
Nisnevish sheaf associated with $\mathbf A^n/(\mathbf A^n-0)$, and the Gysin

Calm\`es and Fasel's category of finite Milnor-Witt correspondences. Using the

radial-azimuthal component of the stress tensor due to the magnetorotational
instability (MRI) is well represented by a power-law function of the gas
pressure rather than a linear relation which has been used in most of the
accretion disc studies. The exponent of this power-law function which depends
on the net flux of the imposed magnetic field is reported in the range between
zero and unity. However, the physical consequences of this power-law
stress-pressure relation within the framework of the standard disc model have
not been explored so far. In this study, the structure of an accretion disc
with a power-law stress-pressure relation is studied using analytical solutions
in the steady-state and time-dependent cases. The derived solutions are
applicable to different accreting systems, and as an illustrative example, we
explore structure of protoplanetary discs using these solutions. We show that
the slopes of the radial surface density and temperature distributions become
steeper with decreasing the stress exponent. However, if the disc opacity is
dominated by icy grains and value of the stress exponent is less than about
$0.5$, the surface density and temperature profiles become so steep that make
them unreliable. We also obtain analytical solutions for the protoplanetary
discs which are irradiated by the host star. Using these solutions, we find
that the effect of the irradiation becomes more significant with decreasing the
stress exponent.

regions - to drive electronic or particle transport. This naturally occurs in
simulations of transport via ultracold atomic gases. Whether the simulation is
numerical or physical, these approaches rely on the rapid development of the
steady state. We demonstrate that steady state formation is a manifestation of
the Gibbs phenomenon well-known in signal processing and in truncated discrete
Fourier expansions. Each particle separately develops into an individual steady
state due to the spreading of its wave packet in energy. The rise to the steady
state for an individual particle depends on the particle energy - and thus can
be slow - and ringing oscillations appear due to filtering of the response
through the electronic bandwidth. However, the rise to the total steady state -
the one from all particles - is rapid, with timescale $\pi/W$, where $W$ is the
bandwidth. Ringing oscillations are now also filtered through the bias window,
and they decay with a higher power. The Gibbs constant - the overshoot of the
first ring - can appear in the simulation error. These results shed light on
the formation of the steady state and support the practical use of explicit
reservoirs to simulate transport at the nanoscale or using ultracold atomic
lattices.

To expedite the science that may be performed with the resulting data it is
necessary to gain a good understanding of planetary yields. Given the observing
strategy employed by TESS the probability of detecting single transits in long
period systems is increased. These systems require careful consideration.
  Aims: To simulate the number of TESS transit detections during its 2 year
mission with a particular emphasis on single transits. Additionally, to
determine the feasibility of ground-based follow-up observations from a single
site.
  Methods: A distribution of planets is simulated around the $\sim$ 4 million
stars in the TESS Candidate Target List. These planets are tested for
detectable transits and characterised. Based on simulated parameters the single
transit detections are further analysed to determine which are amenable to
ground-based follow-up.
  Results: TESS will discover an approximate lower bound of 4700 planets with
around 460 being single transits. A large fraction of these will be observable
from a single ground-based site. This paper finds that, in a single year,
approximately 1000 transit events of around 320 unique TESS single transit
detections are theoretically observable.
  Conclusions: As we consider longer period exoplanets the need for exploring
single transit detections increases. For periods $\gtrsim45$ days the number of
single transit detections outnumber multitransits by a factor of 3 (82$\pm$18
and 25$\pm$7 respectively) a factor which only grows as longer period
detections are considered. Therefore, it is worth expending the extra effort
required to follow-up these more challenging, but potentially very rewarding,
discoveries. Additionally, we conclude that a large fraction of these targets
can be theoretically observed from just a single ground-based site.

aligned with the jet 8.4 GHz radio emission. An H$\alpha$+[N II] filament
coincides with the brightest X-ray emission, the northern hotspot. Analysis of
the X-ray and radio images reveals cavities located at galactic- and cluster-
scales. The galactic-scale cavity is almost devoid of 8.4 GHz radio emission
and the south-western H$\alpha$+[N II] emission is bounded (in projection) by
this cavity. The outer cavity is co-spatial with the peak of 147 MHz radio
emission, and hence we interpret this depression in X-ray surface brightness as
being caused by a buoyantly rising bubble originating from an AGN outburst
$\sim$280 Myrs ago. A \textit{Chandra} snapshot observation allowed us to
constrain the physical parameters of the cluster, which has a cool core with a
low central temperature $\sim$2.8 keV, low central entropy index $\sim$13 keV
cm$^2$ and a short cooling time of $\sim$500 Myr, which is $<0.05$ of the age
of the Universe at this redshift. By fitting jumps in the X-ray density we
found Mach numbers between 1.4 and 1.6, consistent with a shock origin. We also
found compelling evidence of a past merger, indicated by a morphology
reminiscent of gas sloshing in the X-ray residual image. Finally, we computed
the pressures, enthalpies $E_{cav}$ and jet powers $P_{jet}$ associated with
the cavities: $E_{cav}\sim7\times10^{58}$ erg, $P_{jet}\sim1.9\times10^{44}$

gas ($40 \lesssim T \lesssim 65$ K and $50 \lesssim n \lesssim 440$ cm$^{-3}$),
composed mainly of atomic hydrogen and with an effective visual extinction

contributes only $\lesssim$20% of the total [CII] line emission. Thus, [CII] is
not a good tracer for CO-dark H$_2$ at this early phase in the cloud's
lifetime. We also find that the total gas, H and C$^+$ column densities are all
correlated with the integrated [CII] line emission, with power law slopes
ranging from 0.5 to 0.7. Further, the median ratio between the total column
density and the [CII] line emission is $Y_{{\rm CII}}\approx 1.1 \times

statistical mechanical model. Thus, any existing method for finding phase
transitions, such as Monte Carlo simulations, can be applied to approximate the

average larger than their quiescent counterparts. The mass-complete sample of
$\sim3500$ $M_*>10^{10}\, M_\odot$ quiescent galaxies shows that the average
size of a $10^{11}\, M_\odot$ quiescent galaxy increases by $\lesssim25\%$ from
$z\sim0.6$ to $z\sim0.1$. This growth rate is a function of stellar mass: the
most massive ($M_*>10^{11}\, M_\odot$) galaxies grow significantly more slowly
in size than an order of magnitude less massive quiescent systems that grow by
70\% in the $0.1\lesssim z\lesssim0.3$ redshift interval. For $M_*<10^{11}\,
M_\odot$ galaxies age and size are anti-correlated at fixed mass; more massive
quiescent systems show no significant trend in size with average stellar

quiescent systems at intermediate redshift are also a function of galaxy
stellar mass. The suite of evolutionary trends suggests that galaxies more
massive than $\sim10^{11}\, M_\odot$ have mostly assembled their mass by

evolution that is characterized by a combination of individual quiescent galaxy
size growth (through mergers) and an increase in the size of newly quenched

density profile of the ICPNS at $100\, \mathrm{kpc}$ radii has a shallow
logarithmic slope, $-\alpha_{\rm ICL}\simeq -0.8$, dominating the light at the
largest radii. The angular momentum-related $\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$ profile for
the smooth halo remains in the slow rotator regime, out to 135 kpc average
ellipse radius. The velocity dispersione profile is measured to decrease
sharply to $\sigma_{\mathrm{halo}} \sim 100\, \mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ at $R_{\rm

surface density profile of the smooth halo can be reconciled with the circular
velocity curve inferred from assuming hydrostatic equilibrium for the hot X-ray
gas if the orbit distribution of the smooth M87 halo changes strongly from
approximately isotropic within $R_{\rm avg}\sim 60$ kpc to very radially
anisotropic at the largest distances probed. The extended LOSVD of the PNs in
the M87 halo allows the identification of several subcomponents: the ICPNs, the
""crown"" accretion event, and the smooth M87 halo. In galaxies like M87, the
presence of these sub-components needs to be taken into account to avoid
systematic biases in estimating the total enclosed mass. The dynamical
structure inferred from the velocity dispersion profile indicates that the
smooth halo of M87 steepens beyond $R_{\rm avg}=60$ kpc and becomes strongly
radially anisotropic, and that the velocity dispersion profile is consistent
with the X-ray circular velocity curve at these radii without non-thermal

similar setup. In this paper, we explicitly solve Maxwell's equations in a
simplified geometry and demonstrate that in this mass range, the axion induced
electric fields are heavily suppressed by boundary conditions. Unfortunately,
experimentally measuring axion induced electric fields is not feasible in this
mass regime using the currently proposed setups with static primary fields. We
show that at larger axion masses, induced electric fields are not suppressed,
but boundary effects may still be relevant for an experiment's sensitivity. We
then make a general argument about a generic detector configuration with a
static magnetic field to show that the electric fields are always suppressed in
the limit of large wavelength.

  Learning","submitted to ICRA 2019",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dynamical properties of tensegrity robots give them appealing ruggedness
and adaptability, but present major challenges with respect to locomotion
control. Due to high-dimensionality and complex contact responses, data-driven
approaches are apt for producing viable feedback policies. Guided Policy Search
(GPS), a sample-efficient and model-free hybrid framework for optimization and
reinforcement learning, has recently been used to produce periodic locomotion
for a spherical 6-bar tensegrity robot on flat or slightly varied surfaces.
This work provides an extension to non-periodic locomotion and achieves rough
terrain traversal, which requires more broadly varied, adaptive, and
non-periodic rover behavior. The contribution alters the control optimization
step of GPS, which locally fits and exploits surrogate models of the dynamics,
and employs the existing supervised learning step. The proposed solution
incorporates new processes to ensure effective local modeling despite the
disorganized nature of sample data in rough terrain locomotion. Demonstrations
in simulation reveal that the resulting controller sustains the highly adaptive
behavior necessary to reliably traverse rough terrain.

cylinders with mutually disjoint interiors in $3$-dimensional Euclidean space.
The \emph{local density} of a cylinder packing is the ratio between the volume
occupied by the cylinders within a given sphere and the volume of the entire
sphere. The \emph{global density} of the cylinder packing is obtained by
letting the radius of the sphere approach infinity.
  It is known that the greatest global density is obtained when all cylinders
are parallel to each other and each cylinder is surrounded by exactly six
others. In this case, the global density of the cylinder packing equals
$\pi/\sqrt{12}= 0.90689\ldots$. The question is how large a density can a
cylinder packing have if one imposes the restriction that \emph{no two
cylinders are parallel}.
  In this paper we prove two results. First, we show that there exist cylinder
packings with no two cylinders parallel to each other, whose local density is
arbitrarily close to the local density of a packing with parallel cylinders.
Second, we construct a cylinder packing with no two cylinders parallel to each
other whose global density is $1/2$. This improves the results of K. Kuperberg,
C. Graf and P. Paukowisch.

degeneracy between the measurement of the binary distance and inclination which
limits our ability to accurately measure the inclination using gravitational
waves alone. This degeneracy is exacerbated by the expected distribution of
events in the universe, which leads us to prefer face-on systems at a greater
distance. We use a simplified model that only considers the binary distance and
orientation, and show that this gives comparable results to the full parameter
estimates obtained from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. For the
advanced LIGO-Virgo network, it is only signals which are close to edge-on,
with an inclination greater than $\sim 75^{\circ}$ that will be distinguishable
from face-on systems. For extended networks which have good sensitivity to both
gravitational wave polarizations, for face-on systems we will only be able to
constrain the inclination of a signal with SNR 20 to be $45^{\circ}$ or less,
and even for loud signals, with SNR of 100, the inclination of a face-on signal
will only be constrained to $30^{\circ}$. For black hole mergers observed at
cosmological distances, in the absence of higher modes or orbital precession,
the strong degeneracy between inclination and distance dominates the
uncertainty in measurement of redshift and hence the masses of the black holes.

report the reverse effect: modification of vacuum modes by a single atom in
circuit quantum electrodynamics. Our one-dimensional vacuum is a long section
of a high wave impedance (comparable to resistance quantum) superconducting
transmission line. It is directly wired to a transmon qubit circuit. Owing to
the combination of high impedance and galvanic connection, the transmon's
spontaneous emission linewidth can greatly exceed the discrete transmission
line modes spacing. This condition defines a previously unexplored
""superstrong"" coupling regime of quantum electrodynamics where many
frequency-resolved vacuum modes hybridize with a single atom. We establish this
regime by observing the spontaneous emission line of the transmon, revealed
through the mode-by-mode measurement of the vacuum's density of states. The
linewidth as well as the atom-induced dispersive photon-photon interaction are
accurately described by a physically transparent Caldeira-Leggett model, with
the transmon's quartic non-linearity treated as a perturbation.
Non-perturbative modification of vacuum, including inelastic scattering of
single photons, can be enabled by the superstrong coupling regime upon
replacing the transmon by more anharmonic qubits, with broad implications for
simulating quantum impurity models of many-body physics.

attack is applicable to all forms of logic obfuscation, and significantly more
powerful than existing attacks, e.g., SAT-based attacks, since it does not
require the availability of golden functional responses (e.g. an unlocked IC).
Evaluation on benchmark circuits show that we can recover an average of around

from the Valpara\'iso ALMA Line Emission Survey (VALES). From the CO($J=1-0)$
emission line, we quantify the kinematic parameters by modelling the velocity
fields. We find that the IR luminosity increases with the rotational to
dispersion velocity ratio ($V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_v$, corrected for inclination).
We find a dependence between $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_v$ and the [CII]/IR ratio,
suggesting that the so-called `[CII] deficit' is related to the dynamical state
of the galaxies. We find that global pressure support is needed to reconcile
the dynamical mass estimates with the stellar masses in our systems with low
$V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_v$ values. The star formation rate (SFR) is weakly
correlated with the molecular gas fraction ($f_{\rm H_2}$) in our sample,
suggesting that the release of gravitational energy from cold gas may not be
the main energy source of the turbulent motions seen in the VALES galaxies. By
defining a proxy of the `star formation efficiency' parameter as the SFR
divided by the CO luminosity (SFE$'\equiv$ SFR/L$'_{\rm CO}$), we find a
constant SFE$'$ per crossing time ($t_{\rm cross}$). We suggest that $t_{\rm

they are relegated to applications in high-value or niche markets due to the
absence of a low-cost, high-quality production technique. Here we present an
advance in III-V materials synthesis using hydride vapor phase epitaxy that has
the potential to lower III-V semiconductor deposition costs by orders of
magnitude while maintaining the requisite optoelectronic material quality that
enables III-V-based technologies to outperform Si. We demonstrate the impacts
of this advance by addressing the use of III-Vs in terrestrial photovoltaics, a
highly cost-constrained market. The emergence of a low-cost III-V deposition
technique will enable III-V electronic and opto-electronic devices, with all
the benefits that they bring, to permeate throughout modern society.

It
not only provides a thorough background for anyone wishing to use a
probabilistic programming system, but also introduces the techniques needed to
design and build these systems. It is aimed at people who have an
undergraduate-level understanding of either or, ideally, both probabilistic
machine learning and programming languages.
  We start with a discussion of model-based reasoning and explain why
conditioning is a foundational computation central to the fields of
probabilistic machine learning and artificial intelligence. We then introduce a
first-order probabilistic programming language (PPL) whose programs correspond
to graphical models with a known, finite, set of random variables. In the
context of this PPL we introduce fundamental inference algorithms and describe
how they can be implemented.
  We then turn to higher-order probabilistic programming languages. Programs in
such languages can define models with dynamic computation graphs, which may not
instantiate the same set of random variables in each execution. Inference
requires methods that generate samples by repeatedly evaluating the program.
Foundational algorithms for this kind of language are discussed in the context
of an interface between program executions and an inference controller.
  Finally we consider the intersection of probabilistic and differentiable
programming. We begin with a discussion of automatic differentiation, and how
it can be used to implement efficient inference methods based on Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo. We then discuss gradient-based maximum likelihood estimation in
programs that are parameterized using neural networks, how to amortize
inference using by learning neural approximations to the program posterior, and
how language features impact the design of deep probabilistic programming
systems.

increment and minimizing the number of bankrupt participants. The proposals are
generated stochastically; three families of the corresponding distributions are
considered: normal distributions, symmetrized Pareto distributions, and
Student's $t$-distributions. It is found that the ""pit of losses"" paradox
described earlier does not occur in the case of heavy-tailed distributions. The
egoistic strategy better protects agents from extinction in aggressive
environments than the altruistic ones, however, the efficiency of altruism is
higher in more favorable environments. A comparison of altruistic strategies
with each other shows that in aggressive environments, everyone should be
supported to minimize extinction, while under more favorable conditions, it is
more efficient to support the weakest participants. Studying the dynamics of
participants' capitals we identify situations where the two considered criteria
contradict each other. At the next stage of the study, combined voting
strategies and societies involving participants with selfish and altruistic

opportunity to satisfy the strong demand for personalized Point-of-Interest

and POIs, POI recommender systems still face several challenging problems: (1)
the hardness of modeling non-linear user-POI interactions from implicit
feedback; (2) the difficulty of incorporating context information such as POIs'
geographical coordinates. To cope with these challenges, we propose a novel
autoencoder-based model to learn the non-linear user-POI relations, namely
\textit{SAE-NAD}, which consists of a self-attentive encoder (SAE) and a
neighbor-aware decoder (NAD). In particular, unlike previous works equally
treat users' checked-in POIs, our self-attentive encoder adaptively
differentiates the user preference degrees in multiple aspects, by adopting a
multi-dimensional attention mechanism. To incorporate the geographical context
information, we propose a neighbor-aware decoder to make users' reachability
higher on the similar and nearby neighbors of checked-in POIs, which is
achieved by the inner product of POI embeddings together with the radial basis
function (RBF) kernel. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets with many state-of-the-art baseline
methods and evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model.

magnetic reconnection is thought to be important in many astrophysical systems,
ranging from blazar jets and black hole accretion disk coronae to pulsars and
magnetar flares. The presence of a substantial density of high energy photons
($>$MeV) in these systems can make two-photon pair production ($\gamma\gamma\to
e^-e^+$) an additional source of plasma particles and can affect the radiative
properties of these objects. We present the results of novel particle-in-cell
simulations that track both the radiated synchrotron photons and the created
pairs, with which we study the evolution of a two-dimensional reconnecting
current sheet in pair plasma. Synchrotron radiation from accelerated particles
in the current sheet produces hot secondary pairs in the upstream which are
later advected into the current sheet where they are reaccelerated and produce
more photons. In the optically thin regime, when most of the radiation is
leaving the upstream unaffected, this process is self-regulating and depends
only on the background magnetic field and the optical depth of photons to pair
production. The extra plasma loading also affects the properties of
reconnection. We study how the inflow of the secondary plasma, with
multiplicities up to several hundred, reduces the effective magnetization of
the plasma, suppressing the acceleration and thus decreasing the high energy
photon spectrum cutoff. This offers an explanation for the weak dependence of
the observed gamma-ray cutoff in pulsars on the magnetic field at the light
cylinder.

decrease of the band gap with temperature in insulators, crystalline or
otherwise. The gap narrowing largely results from fluctuations of
long-wavelength optical phonons---when the latter are present---or their
disordered analogs, if the material is amorphous. We elaborate on this notion
to show that possibly with the exception of weakly bound solids made of
closed-shell atoms, the existence of an insulating gap or pseudo-gap in a
periodic solid implies that optical phonons must be present, too. This means
that in an insulating solid, the primitive cell must have at least two atoms
and/or that a charge density wave is present. As a corollary, a (periodic)
elemental solid whose primitive unit contains only one atom will ordinarily be
a metal, possibly unless the element belongs to group 18 of the periodic table,
consistent with observation. Some implications of the present results for
quantum solids are briefly discussed, such as that the ground state of the
Wigner crystal must be anti-ferromagnetic. A simple field theory of the
metal-insulator transition is constructed that ties long-wavelength optical
vibrations with fluctuations of an order parameter for the metal-insulator
transition; symmetry-breaking aspects of the latter transition are thereby
highlighted.

the Sun, which extend deep into the convection zone and migrate during solar
cycles towards the equator following the sunspot butterfly diagram. Analysis of
helioseismology data obtained in 1996-2018 for almost two solar cycles reveals
zones of deceleration of the torsional oscillations inside the Sun due to
dynamo-generated magnetic field. The zonal deceleration originates near the
bottom of the convection zone at high latitudes, and migrates to the surface
revealing patterns of magnetic dynamo waves predicted by the Parker's dynamo
theory. The analysis reveals that the primary seat of the solar dynamo is
located in a high-latitude zone of the tachocline. It suggests a dynamo
scenario that can explain 'extended solar cycles' previously observed in the
evolving shape of the solar corona. The results show a substantial decrease of
the zonal acceleration in the current solar cycle and indicate further decline
of activity in the next solar cycle. Although the relationship between the
magnitude of zonal deceleration and the amount of emerged toroidal field that
leads to formation of sunspots is not yet established, the results open a new
perspective for solar cycle modeling and prediction using helioseismology data.

the large-scale quasi-two-dimensional structures forming in the flow at the

immediately accessible parts of its environment, over the course of a few
months creating a model of peripersonal space useful for reaching and grasping
objects around it. Drawing on constraints from the empirical literature on
infant behavior, we present a preliminary computational model of this learning
process, implemented and evaluated on a physical robot. The learning agent
explores the relationship between the configuration space of the arm, sensing
joint angles through proprioception, and its visual perceptions of the hand and
grippers. The resulting knowledge is represented as the peripersonal space
(PPS) graph, where nodes represent states of the arm, edges represent safe
movements, and paths represent safe trajectories from one pose to another. In
our model, the learning process is driven by intrinsic motivation. When
repeatedly performing an action, the agent learns the typical result, but also
detects unusual outcomes, and is motivated to learn how to make those unusual
results reliable. Arm motions typically leave the static background unchanged,
but occasionally bump an object, changing its static position. The reach action
is learned as a reliable way to bump and move an object in the environment.
Similarly, once a reliable reach action is learned, it typically makes a
quasi-static change in the environment, moving an object from one static
position to another. The unusual outcome is that the object is accidentally
grasped (thanks to the innate Palmar reflex), and thereafter moves dynamically
with the hand. Learning to make grasps reliable is more complex than for
reaches, but we demonstrate significant progress. Our current results are steps
toward autonomous sensorimotor learning of motion, reaching, and grasping in
peripersonal space, based on unguided exploration and intrinsic motivation.

In the context of graphical models, investigations of robustness fall under the

algebraic techniques to both concisely represent conditional independence and
to provide a straightforward way of checking the validity of such

to tokamaks, but without a central solenoid and with the toroidal field (TF)
coils tilted with respect to the vertical. This is known from earlier numerical
works, e.g. P.E. Moroz, Phys.Plasmas 2, 4269 (1995). However, such concept
tends to need large coils (of low aspect ratio) but form small plasmas (of
large aspect ratio). Here it is numerically shown that larger, more attractive
vacuum flux surfaces -- relative to the size of the device -- can be generated
by carefully optimizing the inclination of the TF coils and currents in the
various coil-sets. Vacuum configurations of aspect ratios as low as 4 are found
for 6 tilted TF circular coils. Higher numbers of TF coils have advantages
(smaller effective ripple) and disadvantages (lower rotational transform,
smaller plasma). Finally, the aspect-ratio $A$ of the vacuum flux surfaces is
quantified as a function of the ratio $A_c$ of the coil-radius to the radial
location of the coil-center. It is found that, in order to minimize $A$, it is
beneficial to interlink or marginally interlink the TF coils ($A_c \lesssim

  2. For $T=M_\lambda(\cdot \sigma)$ in the subrange $q<p$. We introduce a
scale of simple conditions that depends on an integrability parameter and show
that, on this scale, the sufficiency and necessity are separated only by an
arbitrarily small integrability gap.
  3. For the summation operators $T=T_\lambda(\cdot\sigma)$ in the subrange

shocks are mediated by a filamentary non-resonant (Bell) instability driven by
non-thermal ions, producing magnetic fluctuations on scales comparable to the
ion gyro-radius. In quasi-parallel shocks, both electrons and ions are
accelerated into non-thermal power-laws whose maximum energy grows linearly
with time. The upstream heating of electrons is small, and the two species
enter the shock front in rough thermal equilibrium. The shock's structure is
complex; the current of reflected non-thermal ions evacuates cavities in the
upstream which form filaments of amplified magnetic fields once advected
downstream. At late times, $10\%$ of the shock's energy goes into non-thermal
protons and $\gtrsim10\%$ into magnetic fields. We find that properly capturing
the magnetic turbulence driven by the non-thermal ions is important for
properly measuring the energy fraction of non-thermal electrons, $\epsilon_e$.
We find $\epsilon_e\sim 5\times10^{-4}$ for quasi-parallel shocks with
$v=0.75c$, slightly larger than what was measured in simulations of
non-relativistic shocks. In quasi-perpendicular shocks, no non-thermal
power-law develops in ions or electrons. The ion acceleration efficiency in
quasi-parallel shocks suggests that astrophysical objects that could host
mildly relativistic quasi-parallel shocks -- for example, the jets of active

requiring expert knowledge and extensive tuning of parameters that vary in
different situations. Recently, deep reinforcement learning has shown promise
at automatically learning controllers for complex systems in simulation. This
has been followed by a push towards learning controllers that can be
transferred between simulation and hardware, primarily with the use of domain
randomization. However, domain randomization can make the problem of finding
stable controllers even more challenging, especially for underactuated bipedal
robots. In this work, we explore whether policies learned in simulation can be
transferred to hardware with the use of high-fidelity simulators and structured
controllers. We learn a neural network policy which is a part of a more
structured controller. While the neural network is learned in simulation, the
rest of the controller stays fixed, and can be tuned by the expert as needed.
We show that using this approach can greatly speed up the rate of learning in
simulation, as well as enable transfer of policies between simulation and
hardware. We present our results on an ATRIAS robot and explore the effect of
action spaces and cost functions on the rate of transfer between simulation and
hardware. Our results show that structured policies can indeed be learned in
simulation and implemented on hardware successfully. This has several
advantages, as the structure preserves the intuitive nature of the policy, and
the neural network improves the performance of the hand-designed policy. In
this way, we propose a way of using neural networks to improve expert designed
controllers, while maintaining ease of understanding.

the magnetic field parallel to the line of sight, $B_\parallel$, as well as its
spatial structure, $\sigma_{B_\parallel}$, in the lensing region. In addition,
we discuss how generalized Faraday rotation can constrain the strength of the
perpendicular field, $B_\perp$. We attempt to make such measurements for the
Black Widow pulsar, PSR~B1957+20, in which plasma lensing was recently
discovered. For this system, pressure equilibrium suggests $B\gtrsim 20\,$G at
the interface between the pulsar and companion winds, where the radio eclipse
starts and ends, and where most lensing occurs. We find no evidence for
large-scale magnetic fields, with, on average, $B_\parallel=0.02\pm0.09\,$G
over the egress lensing region. From individual lensing events, we strongly
constrain small scale magnetic structure to $\sigma_B<10\,$mG, thus excluding
scenarios with a strong but rapidly varying field. Finally, from the lack of
reduction of average circular polarization in the same region, we rule out a
strong, quasi-transverse field. We cannot identify any plausible scenario in
which a large magnetic field in this system is concealed, leaving the nature of
the interface between the pulsar and companion winds an enigma. Our method can

negative, and $n(x)$ is the unit exterior normal to $\partial\Omega$ at $x$.

$D>0$ and $\alpha>0$ are, respectively, the diffusive and advection

Nuemann boundary case (i.e., $\beta=0$ on $\partial\Omega$) and Dirichlet

also apply our results to a reaction-diffusion-advection equation which is used
to describe the evolution of a single species living in a heterogeneous stream

in a wide range of applications. In this paper, we approach outlier detection
as a binary-classification issue by sampling potential outliers from a uniform
reference distribution. However, due to the sparsity of data in
high-dimensional space, a limited number of potential outliers may fail to
provide sufficient information to assist the classifier in describing a
boundary that can separate outliers from normal data effectively. To address
this, we propose a novel Single-Objective Generative Adversarial Active
Learning (SO-GAAL) method for outlier detection, which can directly generate
informative potential outliers based on the mini-max game between a generator
and a discriminator. Moreover, to prevent the generator from falling into the
mode collapsing problem, the stop node of training should be determined when
SO-GAAL is able to provide sufficient information. But without any prior
information, it is extremely difficult for SO-GAAL. Therefore, we expand the
network structure of SO-GAAL from a single generator to multiple generators
with different objectives (MO-GAAL), which can generate a reasonable reference
distribution for the whole dataset. We empirically compare the proposed
approach with several state-of-the-art outlier detection methods on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that MO-GAAL outperforms
its competitors in the majority of cases, especially for datasets with various
cluster types or high irrelevant variable ratio.

law concentration dependence G'~$c^{5.64}$, followed by a sharp crossover to a
nearly linear growth at high concentrations. We formulate a theoretical
approach to address all three regimes within a single conceptual Brownian
dynamics framework. A minimalist single particle description is constructed
that allows microgel size to vary with concentration due to steric de-swelling
effects. Using a Hertzian repulsion interparticle potential and a suite of
statistical mechanical theories, quantitative predictions under quiescent
conditions of microgel collective structure, dynamic localization length,
elastic modulus, and the structural relaxation time are made. Based on a
constant inter-particle repulsion strength parameter which is determined by
requiring the theory to reproduce the linear elastic shear modulus over the
entire concentration regime, we demonstrate good agreement between theory and
experiment. Theoretical predictions of how quiescent structural relaxation time
changes under deformation, and how the yield stress and strain change as a

idea of these approaches is to use local constraints and solve problems in
oversampled regions for constructing macroscopic equations. These techniques
are intended for problems without scale separation and high contrast, which
often occur in applications. For linear problems, the local solutions with
constraints are used as basis functions. This technique is called Constraint
Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (CEM-GMsFEM).
GMsFEM identifies macroscopic quantities based on rigorous analysis. In
corresponding upscaling methods, the multiscale basis functions are selected
such that the degrees of freedom have physical meanings, such as averages of
the solution on each continuum.
  This paper extends the linear concepts to nonlinear problems, where the local
problems are nonlinear. The main concept consists of: (1) identifying
macroscopic quantities; (2) constructing appropriate oversampled local problems
with coarse-grid constraints; (3) formulating macroscopic equations. We
consider two types of approaches. In the first approach, the solutions of local
problems are used as basis functions (in a linear fashion) to solve nonlinear
problems. This approach is simple to implement; however, it lacks the nonlinear
interpolation, which we present in our second approach. In this approach, the
local solutions are used as a nonlinear forward map from local averages
(constraints) of the solution in oversampling region. This local fine-grid
solution is further used to formulate the coarse-grid problem. Both approaches
are discussed on several examples and applied to single-phase and two-phase
flow problems, which are challenging because of convection-dominated nature of
the concentration equation.

  Trajectories and Multi-Source Urban Data","25 pages, 11 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vehicle trajectory data collected via GPS-enabled devices have played
increasingly important roles in estimating network-wide traffic, given their
broad spatial-temporal coverage and representativeness of traffic dynamics.
This paper exploits taxi GPS data, license plate recognition (LPR) data and
geographical information for reconstructing the spatial and temporal patterns
of urban traffic emissions. Vehicle emission factor models are employed to
estimate emissions based on taxi trajectories. The estimated emissions are then
mapped to spatial grids of urban areas to account for spatial heterogeneity. To
extrapolate emissions from the taxi fleet to the whole vehicle population, we
use Gaussian process regression models supported by geographical features to
estimate the spatially heterogeneous traffic volume and fleet composition.
Unlike previous studies, this paper utilizes the taxi GPS data and LPR data to
disaggregate vehicle and emission characteristics through space and time in a
large-scale urban network. The results of a case study in Hangzhou, China,
reveal high-resolution spatiotemporal patterns of traffic flows and emissions
and identify emission hotspots at different locations. This study provides an
accessible means of inferring the environmental impact of urban traffic with
multi-source data that are now widely available in urban areas.

labeling or \emph{shallow parsing}, where fields are extracted using local
labels made consistent through probabilistic inference in a graphical model
with constrained transitions. Recently, it has become common to locally
parametrize these models using rich features extracted by recurrent neural
networks (such as LSTM), while enforcing consistent outputs through a simple
linear-chain model, representing Markovian dependencies between successive
labels. However, the simple graphical model structure belies the often complex
non-local constraints between output labels. For example, many fields, such as
a first name, can only occur a fixed number of times, or in the presence of
other fields. While RNNs have provided increasingly powerful context-aware
local features for sequence tagging, they have yet to be integrated with a
global graphical model of similar expressivity in the output distribution. Our
model goes beyond the linear chain CRF to incorporate multiple hidden states
per output label, but parametrizes their transitions parsimoniously with
low-rank log-potential scoring matrices, effectively learning an embedding
space for hidden states. This augmented latent space of inference variables
complements the rich feature representation of the RNN, and allows exact global
inference obeying complex, learned non-local output constraints. We experiment
with several datasets and show that the model outperforms baseline CRF+RNN
models when global output constraints are necessary at inference-time, and
explore the interpretable latent structure.

often produces more accurate forecasts than a forecast from a single model. The
crucial part of forecast accuracy improvement in using the model averaging lies
in the determination of optimal weights from a finite sample. If the weights
are selected sub-optimally, this can affect the accuracy of the model-averaged
forecasts. Instead of choosing the optimal weights, we consider trimming a set
of models before equally averaging forecasts from the selected superior models.
Motivated by Hansen, Lunde and Nason (2011), we apply and evaluate the model
confidence set procedure when combining mortality forecasts. The proposed model
averaging procedure is motivated by Samuels and Sekkel (2017) based on the
concept of model confidence sets as proposed by Hansen et al. (2011) that
incorporates the statistical significance of the forecasting performance. As
the model confidence level increases, the set of superior models generally
decreases. The proposed model averaging procedure is demonstrated via national
and sub-national Japanese mortality for retirement ages between 60 and 100+.
Illustrated by national and sub-national Japanese mortality for ages between 60
and 100+, the proposed model-average procedure gives the smallest interval
forecast errors, especially for males. We find that robust out-of-sample point
and interval forecasts may be obtained from the trimming method. By robust, we
mean robustness against model misspecification.

This configuration is applicable to icy Solar System bodies such as Triton as
well as a range of possible exoplanet atmospheres, including water or
$\mathrm{CO_2}$ iceballs or ocean worlds, and lava planets with mineral vapor
atmospheres. Climate regimes for slowly rotating planets with the hot-spot near
the substellar point, and for rapidly rotating planets with a warm equatorial
belt, are both treated. A non-dimensional parameter controlling the fractional
variation of the surface pressure is derived; it measures whether the pure
condensible atmosphere is global or localized. The global pure condensible
atmosphere with the non-dimensional parameter much less than order of unity is
maintained by the strong horizontal latent heat transport associated with an
""evaporation/sublimation-driven flow"" from warm to cold places that compensates
for the incoming differential radiative forcing. We show that the variation of
surface temperature can be estimated in terms of this non-dimensional parameter

nearly isothermal surface conditions even when the substellar surface

noisy input/output measurements has attracted recent attention as an
alternative to parameter identification for bounding unmodeled dynamics in
robust control. In this paper, we study lower bounds for
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm estimation under a query model where at each
iteration the algorithm chooses a bounded input signal and receives the
response of the chosen signal corrupted by white noise. We prove that when the
underlying system is an FIR filter, $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm estimation is no
more efficient than model identification for passive sampling. For active
sampling, we show that norm estimation is at most a factor of $\log{r}$ more
sample efficient than model identification, where $r$ is the length of the
filter. We complement our theoretical results with experiments which
demonstrate that a simple non-adaptive estimator of the norm is competitive
with state-of-the-art adaptive norm estimation algorithms.

incredible size of topological states. Here, we present a case study of
developing deep learning algorithms to predict bandgaps of boron-nitrogen pair
doped graphene with arbitrary dopant topologies. A material descriptor system
that enables to correlate structures with the bandgaps was developed for
convolutional neuron networks (CNNs). Bandgaps calculated by the ab initio
calculations and the corresponding structures were fed as input datasets to
train VGG16 convolutional network, residual convolutional network, and
concatenate convolutional network. Then these trained CNNs were used to predict
bandgaps of doped graphene with various dopant topologies. All of them afford
great prediction accuracy, showing square of the coefficient of correlation
(R2) of > 90% and root-mean-square errors of ~ 0.1 eV for the predicted
bandgaps. They are much better than those predicted by a shallow machine
learning method - support vector machine. The transfer learning was further
performed by leveraging data generated from smaller systems to improve the
prediction for large systems. Success of this work provides a cornerstone for
future investigation of topologically doped graphene and other 2D materials.
Moreover, given ubiquitous existence of topologies in materials, this work will
stimulate widespread interests in applying deep learning algorithms to
topological design of materials crossing atomic, nano-, meso-, and macro-

across Titan's disk during the same epoch (2012 to 2015): HCN, HC$_3$N,
C$_3$H$_4$, and CH$_3$CN. We find that Titan's minor constituents exhibit large
latitudinal variations, with enhanced abundances at high latitudes compared to
equatorial measurements; this includes CH$_3$CN, which eluded previous
detection by Cassini in the stratosphere, and thus spatially resolved abundance
measurements were unattainable. Even over the short 3-year period, vertical
profiles and integrated emission maps of these molecules allow us to observe
temporal changes in Titan's atmospheric circulation during northern spring. Our
derived abundance profiles are comparable to contemporary measurements from
Cassini infrared observations, and we find additional evidence for subsidence
of enriched air onto Titan's south pole during this time period. Continued

crushing of granular materials. At first, a simple drop weight experiment was
designed in order to study the effect of the location of three contact edges on
the fracture pattern and the strength of a model cylindrical particle. The
sample was placed on two bottom contact edges symmetrically distributed with
reference to the vertical symmetry plane of the particle and subjected to an
impact at the top. Angle $\alpha$ between the plane connecting a bottom contact
edge to the centerline of the cylinder and a vertical plane was varied. The
energy required to fracture the particle was shown to be an increasing function
of angle $\alpha$. Peculiar crack patterns were also observed. Then, we present
a discrete model of grain fracture based on the work of Neveu et al. (2016) and
employ it for a numerical analysis of the problem. The cylindrical particle is
discretized by means of a space filling Vorono\""i tessellation, and submitted
to a compression test for different values of angle $\alpha$. In agreement with
experiments, simulations predict a strong effect of the contact orientation on
the strength of the particle as well as similar fracture patterns. The effect
of the number of contacts is also explored and the importance of a potential
pre-load is emphasized. We show that the fracture pattern: (i) is diametrical
in case of diametrically opposed edges, (ii) has an inverted Y-shape in the
case of three or four edges. Interestingly, in the latter case, if one of the
lateral edges is slightly shifted, the fracture initiates and even propagates
diametrically. Furthermore, the particle strength increases with the number of
contacts.

density-functional theory calculations, that the adsorption of H atoms on the

dangling bonds (DBs) and their spin orderings. It is revealed that the H
adsorption on a rest-atom site exhibits a Jahn-Teller-like distortion that
accompanies a charge transfer from the rest atom to the nearest neighboring
adatoms. This charge transfer increases the local density of states of such
three adatoms at the Fermi level, thereby inducing a Stoner-type instability to
produce a ferrimagnetic order of adatom DBs around the adsorbed H atom.
Meanwhile, the H adsorption on an adatom site cannot induce spin polarization,
but, as adsorbed H atoms increase, the ferrimagnetic order of rest-atom DBs
emerges through the charge transfer from rest atoms to adatoms. Our findings
provide a microscopic mechanism of the H-induced spin orderings of Si DBs at
the atomic scale, which paves a novel way to the design of nanoscale magnetism

light in vacuum. Our cISP design augments the Internet's fiber with free-space
wireless connectivity. cISP addresses the fundamental challenge of
simultaneously providing low latency and scalable bandwidth, while accounting
for numerous practical factors ranging from transmission tower availability to
packet queuing. We show that instantiations of cISP across the contiguous
United States and Europe would achieve mean latencies within 5% of that
achievable using great-circle paths at the speed of light, over medium and long
distances. Further, we estimate that the economic value from such networks

1990's. Today, entanglement is often presented as a resource, the resource of
quantum information science and technology. However, entanglement is exploited
twice in quantum teleportation. First, entanglement is the `quantum
teleportation channel', i.e. entanglement between distant systems. Second,
entanglement appears in the eigenvectors of the joint measurement that Alice,
the sender, has to perform jointly on the quantum state to be teleported and
her half of the `quantum teleportation channel', i.e. entanglement enabling
entirely new kinds of quantum measurements. I emphasize how poorely this second
kind of entanglement is understood. In particular, I use quantum networks in

illustrate that the quantumness of such joint measurements remains elusive,

trivalent 4f ion has challenged the condensed matter research community for
almost three decades. A drawback for progress in this direction has been the
lack of studies combining physical properties and accurate structural data
covering the full nickelate phase diagram. Here we focus on a small region
close to the itinerant limit (R = Pr, 1.5K < T < 300K), where we investigate
the gap opening and the simultaneous emergence of charge order in PrNiO3. We
combine electric resistance, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements with
high resolution neutron and synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction data that, in
contrast to previous studies, we analyze in terms of symmetry-adapted
distortion modes. Such analysis allows to identify the contribution of the
different modes to the global distortion in a broad temperature range.
Moreover, it shows that the structural changes at the MIT, traditionally
described in terms of the evolution of the interatomic distances and angles,
appear as abrupt increases of all nonzero mode amplitudes at TMIT = TN ~130K
accompanied by the appearance of new modes below this temperature. A further
interesting observation is the existence of a nearly perfect linear correlation
between the amplitude of the breathing mode associated to the charge order and
the staggered magnetization below the MIT. Our data also uncover a previously
unnoticed anomaly at T* ~60K (~0.4 x TMIT), clearly visible in the electrical
resistance, lattice parameters and some mode amplitudes. Since phase
coexistence is only observed in a small temperature region around TMIT (~10K),
these observations suggest the existence of a hidden symmetry in the insulating
phase. We discuss some possible origins, among them the theoretically predicted
existence of polar distortions induced by the non-centrosymmetric magnetic
order.

combining these measurements with available data in the literature, we find two

evolution with QSO age seen in four $z>6$ QSOs. We find the anti-correlation
between the Ly$\alpha$ halo scales with QSOs' IR luminosity, with J2329-0301's
halo being the brightest and largest. It indicates that ionizing photons escape
more easily out to circum-galactic regions when host galaxies are less dusty.
We also find a positive correlation between IR luminosity and black hole mass

hypothesis that a large Ly$\alpha$ halo mainly exists around QSOs in the young
phase of their activity due to a small amount of dust. The second is an
evolution with cosmic time seen over $z\sim2-5$. We find the increase of
surface brightness toward lower-redshift with a similar growth rate to that of
dark matter halos (DHs) which evolve to $M_\text{DH}=10^{12}-10^{13}$ M$_\odot$
at $z=2$. The extent of Ly$\alpha$ halos is also found to increase at a rate
scaling with the virial radius of growing DHs, $r_\text{vir} \propto

scenario that the CGM around QSOs evolves in mass and size keeping pace with

with attractive interactions or repulsive interactions are investigated in
detail. We demonstrate that dark solitons in one of component admit
interference and tunneling behaviour, in sharp contrast to the scalar dark
solitons and vector dark solitons. The analytic analysis of interference
properties shows that spatial interference pattern is determined by the
relative velocity of solitons, while temporal interference pattern depends on
the velocities and widths of two solitons, differing from the interference
properties of scalar bright solitons. Especially, for attractive interactions
system, we show that interference effects can induce some short-time density
humps (whose densities are higher than background density) during the collision
process of dark solitons. Moreover, the maximum hump value is remarkably
sensitive to the variation of the solitons' parameters. For repulsive
interactions system, the temporal-spatial interference periods have lower
limits. Numerical simulations results suggest that interference patterns for
dark-bright solitons are more robust against noises than bright-dark solitons.
These explicit interference properties can be used to measure the velocities

observed experimentally and could be used to design matter wave soliton

this was known with $f$ being an Ackermann-type function in $r$ and $d$ but not

$\eta$. The work of this paper was motivated by an attempt to obtain a
qualitative description of closed subsets of the Cayley graph $\Gamma$ whose
vertex set is $\mathbb F_2^{n_1}\otimes \dots \otimes \mathbb F_2^{n_d}$ with
two vertices joined by an edge if their difference is of the form $u_1\otimes

completed the proof of the 2-to-2 conjecture. In this paper, we formulate a
conjecture for higher dimensions, and prove it in an important special case.
Also, we identify a statement about $\eta$-closed sets in Cayley graphs on
arbitrary finite Abelian groups that implies the conjecture and can be
considered as a ""highly asymmetric Balog-Szemer\'edi-Gowers theorem"" when it

was detected at $f_{\rm X}$(0.2-12 keV) = 8$\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$, one of its highest flux levels reported to date. The measured pulse
period was $P_{\rm spin}$ = 58.949(1) s, very similar to the periods measured
in most of the previous observations. The pulsed emission was clearly detected
over the whole energy range between 0.2 and 12 keV, but the pulse profile is
energy dependent and the pulsed fraction increases as the energy increases.
Although the time-averaged EPIC spectrum is dominated by a power-law component
(with photon index $\Gamma = 0.76 \pm 0.01$), the data show an evident soft
excess, which can be described with the sum of a black-body and a hot thermal
plasma component (with temperatures $kT_{\rm BB} = 171^{+11}_{-14}$ eV and
$kT_{\rm APEC} = 1.09^{+0.16}_{-0.09}$ keV, respectively). Moreover, the EPIC
and RGS spectra show narrow emission lines due to N, O, Ne, Mg, and Fe. The
phase-resolved spectral analysis of the EPIC data shows that the flux of the
black-body component varies with the pulse phase, while the plasma component is
almost constant. We show that the black-body component can be attributed to the
reprocessing of the primary emission by the optically thick material at the
inner edge of the accretion disc, while the hot plasma component is due to a
diffuse gas far from the accretion region and the narrow emission lines of the
RGS spectrum are most probably due to photoionized matter around the accreting
source.

restrict or monitor what children can access online, instead of discussing
privacy issues with children. Parents work hard to protect their children's

hence how well parents can safeguard their children from this kind of risks.
  Parents have always been playing a pivotal role in mitigating children's
interactions with digital technologies --- from TV to game consoles, to
personal computers --- but the rapidly changing technologies are posing
challenges for parents to keep up with. There is a pressing need to understand
how much parents are aware of privacy risks concerning the use of tablets and
how they are managing them for their primary school-aged young children. At the

simplify the complexes of the input sequence by using strong collapses, as
introduced by J. Barmak and E. Miniam [DCG (2012)], and to compute the PH of an
induced sequence of reduced simplicial complexes that has the same PH as the
initial one. Our approach has several salient features that distinguishes it
from previous work. It is not limited to filtrations (i.e. sequences of nested
simplicial subcomplexes) but works for other types of sequences like towers and
zigzags. To strong collapse a simplicial complex, we only need to store the
maximal simplices of the complex, not the full set of all its simplices, which
saves a lot of space and time. Moreover, the complexes in the sequence can be
strong collapsed independently and in parallel. Finally, we can compromize
between precision and time by choosing the number of simplicial complexes of
the sequence we strong collapse. As a result and as demonstrated by numerous
experiments on publicly available data sets, our approach is extremely fast and
memory efficient in practice.

by enriching classical propositional logic with a typicality operator capturing
the most typical (alias normal or conventional) situations in which a given
sentence holds. The semantics of PTL is in terms of ranked models as studied in
the well-known KLM approach to preferential reasoning and therefore KLM-style
rational consequence relations can be embedded in PTL. In spite of the
non-monotonic features introduced by the semantics adopted for the typicality
operator, the obvious Tarskian definition of entailment for PTL remains
monotonic and is therefore not appropriate in many contexts. Our first
important result is an impossibility theorem showing that a set of proposed
postulates that at first all seem appropriate for a notion of entailment with
regard to typicality cannot be satisfied simultaneously. Closer inspection
reveals that this result is best interpreted as an argument for advocating the
development of more than one type of PTL entailment. In the spirit of this
interpretation, we investigate three different (semantic) versions of
entailment for PTL, each one based on the definition of rational closure as
introduced by Lehmann and Magidor for KLM-style conditionals, and constructed
using different notions of minimality.

populate Forwarding Information Base (FIB) tables so that the Interest messages
can be forwarded. To populate FIBs, clients and routers require some routing
information. One method to obtain this information is that network nodes
exchange routing information by each node advertising the available content
objects. Bloom Filter-based Routing approaches like BFR [1], use Bloom Filters
(BFs) to advertise all provided content objects, which consumes valuable
bandwidth and storage resources. This strategy is inefficient as clients
request only a small number of the provided content objects and they do not
need the content advertisement information for all provided content objects. In
this paper, we propose a novel routing algorithm for NDN called pull-based BFR
in which servers only advertise the demanded file names. We compare the
performance of pull-based BFR with original BFR and with a flooding-assisted
routing protocol. Our experimental evaluations show that pull-based BFR
outperforms original BFR in terms of communication overhead needed for content
advertisements, average roundtrip delay, memory resources needed for storing
content advertisements at clients and routers, and the impact of false positive
reports on routing. The comparisons also show that pull-based BFR outperforms

structural, chemical and dielectric properties of HaPs in reference to their
PV-related properties.
  * I present my main research model: HaP single-crystals - their growth and
characterization;
  * I start by exploring the bond nature of HaPs using Nanoindentation and
Solid-State NMR techniques.
  * I explore the 'deformation potential' of the structure and show that its
low and positive value in HaPs strongly suggests a pronounced 'defect
tolerance'.
  * I explore the scattering mechanism of charges in the soft and highly
polarizable system such as HaPs, and show that its low mobility (relative to
other heteropolar systems) is fundamental and cannot be improved. I also show
that a positive 'deformation potential' (so the valence band is 'anti-bonding',
where a system should promote 'defect-tolerance') is something that is common
to other highly polarizable systems, such as AgX, and Pb-chalcogenides.
  * I explore the chemistry of the system and show that HaPs can easily break
to constituents, but also easily be made by the same constituents, suggesting a
low activation energy for annealing process to take care even at RT. This RT
annealing can promote 'self-healing' at ~second to ~minute time-scale, which we
clearly observe. We find 'entropic-stabilization' to be very important in
'self-healing' processes of that kind.
  * I explore the importance of symmetry breaking in the HaP structure, which
can induce a polar - and thus Ferroelectric - structure. We conclude that
Ferroelectricity is not a fundamental property of HaPs, since it doesn't exist
in MAPbBr3, but only in MAPbI3 - as proven unambiguously - and what is present
in MAPbI3 is in doubt important for photovoltaics, when using them at RT or
above.

waveguide which is unbounded in one direction and bounded in the two other
(transverse) directions. We assume that the waveguide is thin in one of these
transverse directions, which leads us to consider a Kirchhoff-Love plate model
in a locally perturbed 2D strip. For time harmonic scattering problems in
unbounded domains, well-posedness does not hold in a classical setting and it
is necessary to prescribe the behaviour of the solution at infinity. This is
challenging for the model that we consider and constitutes our main
contribution. Two types of boundary conditions are considered: either the strip
is simply supported or the strip is clamped. The two boundary conditions are
treated with two different methods. For the simply supported problem, the
analysis is based on a result of Hilbert basis in the transverse section. For
the clamped problem, this property does not hold. Instead we adopt the
Kondratiev's approach, based on the use of the Fourier transform in the
unbounded direction, together with techniques of weighted Sobolev spaces with
detached asymptotics. After introducing radiation conditions, the corresponding
scattering problems are shown to be well-posed in the Fredholm sense. We also
show that the solutions are the physical (outgoing) solutions in the sense of
the limiting absorption principle.

  Speakers",,,,,"cs.CV cs.MM stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we address the problem of tracking multiple speakers via the
fusion of visual and auditory information. We propose to exploit the
complementary nature of these two modalities in order to accurately estimate
smooth trajectories of the tracked persons, to deal with the partial or total
absence of one of the modalities over short periods of time, and to estimate
the acoustic status -- either speaking or silent -- of each tracked person
along time. We propose to cast the problem at hand into a generative
audio-visual fusion (or association) model formulated as a latent-variable
temporal graphical model. This may well be viewed as the problem of maximizing
the posterior joint distribution of a set of continuous and discrete latent
variables given the past and current observations, which is intractable. We
propose a variational inference model which amounts to approximate the joint
distribution with a factorized distribution. The solution takes the form of a
closed-form expectation maximization procedure. We describe in detail the
inference algorithm, we evaluate its performance and we compare it with several
baseline methods. These experiments show that the proposed audio-visual tracker
performs well in informal meetings involving a time-varying number of people.

volume-splitting splits the hypothesis edges to reduce the Vapnik-Chervonenkis

critically depends on the initial hypothesis and this problem is also known as
target-dependent label complexity gap. This paper attempts to minimize this gap
by introducing a novel notion of number density which provides a more natural
and direct way to describe the hypothesis distribution than volume. By
discovering the connections between hypothesis and input distribution, we map
the volume of version space into the number density and propose a
target-independent distribution-splitting strategy with the following
advantages: 1) provide theoretical guarantees on reducing label complexity and
error rate as volume-splitting; 2) break the curse of initial hypothesis; 3)
provide model guidance for a target-independent AL algorithm in real AL tasks.
With these guarantees, for AL application, we then split the input distribution
into more near-optimal spheres and develop an application algorithm called
Distribution-based A^2 (DA^2). Experiments further verify the effectiveness of
the halving and querying abilities of DA^2. Contributions of this paper are as
follows.

spectrum of the problem in $\Omega$ is known to be residual and to cover the
whole complex plane, but on the contrary, the spectrum in the Lipschitz domain
$\Omega^\varepsilon$ is discrete. However, our results reveal the strange
behavior of the discrete spectrum as the blunting parameter $\varepsilon$ tends
to 0: we construct asymptotic forms of the eigenvalues and detect families of
""hardly movable"" and ""plummeting"" ones. The first type of the eigenvalues do
not leave a small neighborhood of a point for any small $\varepsilon > 0$ while
the second ones move at a high rate $O(|\ln \varepsilon|)$ downwards along the
real axis $\mathbb{R}$ to $ -\infty$. At the same time, any point $\lambda \in
\mathbb{R}$ is a ""blinking eigenvalue"", i.e., it belongs to the spectrum of the
problem in $\Omega^\varepsilon$ almost periodically in the $|\ln
\varepsilon|$-scale. Besides standard spectral theory, we use the techniques of
dimension reduction and self-adjoint extensions to obtain these results.

models have several advantages, as their geometry description is inherently
watertight and they provide a description of the model's interior. To be able
to use the explicit mathematical description of these models, we employ the
Finite Cell Method (FCM). Herein, the only necessary input is a reliable
statement whether an (integration-) point lies inside or outside of the
geometric model. This paper mainly discusses such point-in-membership tests on
various geometric objects like sweeps and lofts, as well as several geometric
operations such as filleting or chamfering. We demonstrate that, based on the
information of the construction method of these objects, the
point-in-membership-test can be carried out efficiently and robustly

efficiency and simultaneously near-perfect indistinguishability in all degrees
of freedom (including spectral, temporal, spatial, and polarization). However,
previous high-indistinguishability solid-state single-photon sources had to
rely on polarization filtering that reduced the system efficiency by at least
50%. Here, we overcome this challenge by developing a new single-photon source
based on a coherently driven quantum dot embedded in an elliptical micropillar.
The asymmetric cavity lifts the polarization degeneracy into two orthogonal
linearly polarized modes with a suitable energy separation. We design an
excitation-collection scheme that allows the creation and collection of single
photons with an indistinguishability of 0.976(1) and a degree of polarization
of 91%. Our method provides a solution of combining near-unity system

analysis evaluates thermal noise from both the substrate and the optical
reflective and antireflective stacks located on the BS surface. We demonstrate
that the fluctuations of both reflecting and anti-reflecting surfaces
significantly contribute to the total thermal noise of the BS. The oscillating
intensity pattern couples small-scale distortions of the surface to the overall
phase readout, and therefore increases the overall thermal noise. In the case
of aLIGO, the BS contribution is with $0.3\%$ negligibly small. At a frequency
of 500Hz, the BS causes about $10\%$ of GEO600's sensitivity limit. BS noise
impairs the feasible sensitivity of the GEO-HF design proposal by about $50\%$.

formulate the problem of finding the optimal quality decisions and fetching
policy of the SVC layers of video chunks subject to the available bandwidth,
chunk deadlines, and cooperation willingness of the different users as an
optimization problem. The objective is to optimize a QoE metric that maintains
a trade-off between maximizing the playback rate of every chunk while ensuring
fairness among all chunks for the minimum skip/stall duration without violating

driver of self-organization in biological systems in general and biogenesis of
cellular organelles in particular, but the molecular mechanisms of symmetry
breaking only begin to become understood. Centrioles, the structural cores of
centrosomes and cilia, must duplicate every cell cycle to ensure their faithful
inheritance through cellular divisions. Work in model organisms identified
conserved proteins required for centriole duplication and found that altering
their abundance affects centriole number. However, the biophysical principles
that ensure that, under physiological conditions, only a single procentriole is
produced on each mother centriole remain enigmatic. Here we propose a
mechanistic biophysical model for the initiation of procentriole formation in
mammalian cells. The model faithfully recapitulates the experimentally observed
transition from PLK4 uniformly distributed around the mother centriole, the
""ring"", to a unique PLK4 focus, the ""spot"", that triggers the assembly of a new
procentriole. This symmetry breaking requires a dual positive feedback based on
autocatalytic activation of PLK4 and enhanced centriolar anchoring of PLK4-STIL
complexes by phosphorylated STIL. We find that, contrary to previous proposals,
in situ degradation of active PLK4 is insufficient to break symmetry. Instead,
the model predicts that competition between transient PLK4 activity maxima for
PLK4-STIL complexes explains both the instability of the PLK4 ring and
formation of the unique PLK4 spot. In the model, strong competition at
physiologically normal parameters robustly produces a single procentriole,
while increasing overexpression of PLK4 and STIL weakens the competition and
causes progressive addition of procentrioles in agreement with experimental
observations.

decomposition is a powerful tool that is the workhorse of many methods both in
mathematics and applied fields. A prominent application in recent years is the
approximation of high-dimensional functions in a low-rank format. This is based
on the fact that, under certain conditions, a tensor can be identified with a
compact operator and SVD applies to the latter. One key assumption for this
application is that the tensor product norm is not weaker than the injective
norm. This assumption is not fulfilled in Sobolev spaces, which are widely used
in the theory and numerics of partial differential equations. Our goal is the
analysis of the SVD in Sobolev spaces. This work consists of two parts. In this

systematic errors of ~20% at physical quark masses. The formalism introduced

memorize the data, and fit everything in the end. Although equipped with
corrections for noisy labels, many learning methods in this area still suffer
overfitting due to undesired memorization. In this paper, to relieve this
issue, we propose stochastic integrated gradient underweighted ascent (SIGUA):
in a mini-batch, we adopt gradient descent on good data as usual, and
learning-rate-reduced gradient ascent on bad data; the proposal is a versatile
approach where data goodness or badness is w.r.t. desired or undesired
memorization given a base learning method. Technically, SIGUA pulls
optimization back for generalization when their goals conflict with each other;
philosophically, SIGUA shows forgetting undesired memorization can reinforce
desired memorization. Experiments demonstrate that SIGUA successfully
robustifies two typical base learning methods, so that their performance is
often significantly improved.

  Systems","This document is the author's PhD Dissertation. It is 138 pages long
  and contains 36 Figures and 4 Tables",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pulse Compression (PC) active sonar waveforms provide a significant
improvement in range resolution over single frequency sinusoidal waveforms also
known as Continuous Wave (CW) waveforms. Since their inception in the 1940's, a
wide variety of PC waveforms have been designed using either Frequency
Modulation (FM), phase coding, or frequency hopping to suite particular sonar
applications. The Sinusoidal FM (SFM) waveform modulates its Instantaneous
Frequency (IF) by a single frequency sinusoid to achieve high Doppler
sensitivity which also aids in suppressing reverberation. This allows the SFM
waveform to resolve target velocities. While the SFM's resolution in range is
inversely proportional to its bandwidth, the SFM's Auto-Correlation Function
(ACF) contains many large sidelobes. The periodicity of the SFM's IF creates
these sidelobes and impairs the SFM's ability to clearly distinguish multiple
targets in range. This dissertation describes a generalization of the SFM
waveform, referred to as the Generalized SFM (GSFM) waveform, that modifies the
IF to resemble the time/voltage characteristic of a FM chirp waveform. As a
result of this modification, the Doppler sensitivity of the SFM is preserved
while substantially reducing the high range sidelobes producing a waveform
whose Ambiguity Function (AF) approaches a thumbtack shape. This dissertation
describes the properties of the GSFM's thumbtack AF shape, compares it to other
well known waveforms with a similar AF shape, and additionally considers some
of the practical considerations of active sonar systems including transmitting
the GSFM on piezoelectric transducers and the GSFM's ability to suppress
reverberation. Lastly, this dissertation also describes designing a family of
in-band nearly orthogonal waveforms with potential applications to Continuous
Active Sonar (CAS).

approaches, where the shock-waves-driven chemistry of mutually colliding
isocyanic acid (HNCO) containing icy grains has been simulated by
first-principles. At the shock wave velocity threshold triggering the chemical
transformation of the sample (7 km/s), formamide is the first synthesized
species representing thus the spring-board for the further complexification of
the system. In addition, upon increasing the shock impact velocity, formamide
is formed in progressively larger amounts. More interestingly, at the highest
velocity considered (10 km/s), impacts drive the production of diverse
carbon-carbon bonded species. In addition to glycine, the building block of
alanine (i.e., ethanimine) and one of the major components of a plethora of
amino-acids including, e.g., asparagine, cysteine, and leucine (i.e.,
vinylamine) have been detected after shock compression of samples containing
the most widespread molecule in the universe (H2) and the simplest compound
bearing all the primary biogenic elements (HNCO). The present results indicate
novel chemical pathways toward the chemical complexity typical of interstellar
and circumstellar regions.

on average produce ~0.3 M_sun of dust, we explore a simple dust production
scenario which applies to star-forming galaxies in the local environment (the
Magellanic Clouds and possibly the Milky Way) as well as to high redshift (sub-
millimeter, QSO, Lyman break) galaxies. We assume that the net dust destruction
(due to supernova reverse shock, shocks in the interstellar medium, or
astration) is negligible on a timescale of 1 Gyr, in which case the dust mass
can be estimated as 0.004 times the star-formation rate (for a Chabrier IMF)
multiplied by the duration of the star-formation episode. The model can account
for observed dust masses over four orders of magnitude and across the redshift
range 0-8.4, with dust production rates spanning five orders of magnitudes.
This suggests that star-forming galaxies may be seen as maximally dusty, in the
sense that a dominant fraction of the dust-forming elements forged in a
supernova eventually will go into the solid phase. In turn, this indicates
little destruction of supernova dust or almost complete replenishment, on a
short time scale, of any dust that is destroyed.

(CCG) is utilized to propose a P2P energy trading scheme, in which a set of

CCG framework, the mid-market rate is utilized as a pricing mechanism of the
proposed P2P trading to confirm the stability of the coalition as well as to
guarantee the benefit to the prosumers for forming the social coalition. The
paper further introduces the motivational psychology models that are relevant

there is a disparity in the theory and practice of CFO. In this paper, we
systematically study CFO techniques proposed for Java programs, both from

dataset of 16 programs with varying software characteristics, and different
obfuscator parameters. Each program is carefully reverse engineered to study
the effect of obfuscation. Our study reveals that there are 36 unique
techniques proposed in the literature and 7 from tools. Three of the most
popular commercial obfuscators implement only 13 of the 36 techniques in the

the underlying component of a program that is transformed. We identify the
techniques that are potent against reverse engineering attacks, both from the
perspective of a human analyst and an automated program decompiler. Our
analysis reveals that majority of the tools do not implement these techniques,
thus defeating the protection obfuscation offers. We furnish examples of select

shown to be a very powerful strategy to acquire a large lexicon in a short

modeling the word-learning process. In particular, an earlier model assumed
that a learner could perfectly recall all previous instances of a word's use
and the inferences that were drawn about its meaning. In this work, we relax
this assumption and determine the performance of a model cross-situational
learner who forgets word-meaning associations over time. Our main finding is
that it is possible for this learner to acquire a human-scale lexicon by
adulthood with word-exposure and memory-decay rates that are consistent with
empirical research on childhood word learning, as long as the degree of
referential uncertainty is not too high or the learner employs a mutual
exclusivity constraint. Our findings therefore suggest that successful word
learning does not necessarily demand either highly accurate long-term tracking

the two aforementioned humanoids, this platform has the potential to interact
with a more human-scale environment. This paper describes a software framework
for the NimbRo-OP that is based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware.
The software provides functionality for hardware abstraction, visual

goodness-of-fit criterion for fitting linear models. $R^2$ is somewhat
controversial when fitting nonlinear models, although it may be generalised on
a case-by-case basis to deal with specific models such as the logistic model.
Assume we are fitting a parametric distribution to a data set using, say, the
maximum likelihood estimation method. A general approach to measure the
goodness-of-fit of the fitted parameters, which is advocated herein, is to use
a nonparametric measure for comparison between the empirical distribution,
comprising the raw data, and the fitted model. In particular, for this purpose
we put forward the Survival Jensen-Shannon divergence ($SJS$) and its empirical
counterpart (${\cal E}SJS$) as a metric which is bounded, and is a natural
generalisation of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. We demonstrate, via a
straightforward procedure making use of the ${\cal E}SJS$, that it can be used
as part of maximum likelihood estimation or curve fitting as a measure of
goodness-of-fit, including the construction of a confidence interval for the
fitted parametric distribution. Furthermore, we show the validity of the
proposed method with simulated data, and three empirical data sets.

therapy is conventionally done by comparing measurements of spatial
distributions with Monte Carlo (MC) predictions. However, decay curves can
provide additional independent information about the treatment and the
irradiated tissue. Most studies performed so far focus on long time intervals.
Here we investigate the reliability of MC predictions of space and time (decay
rate) profiles shortly after irradiation, and we show how the decay rates can
give an indication about the elements of which the phantom is made up.
  Methods and Materials: Various phantoms were irradiated in clinical and
near-clinical conditions at the Cyclotron Centre of the Bronowice proton
therapy centre. PET data were acquired with a planar 16x16 cm$^2$ PET system.
MC simulations of particle interactions and photon propagation in the phantoms
were performed using the FLUKA code. The analysis included a comparison between
experimental data and MC simulations of space and time profiles, as well as a
fitting procedure to obtain the various isotope contributions in the phantoms.
  Results and conclusions: There was a good agreement between data and MC
predictions in 1-dimensional space and decay rate distributions. The fractions
of $^{11}$C, $^{15}$O and $^{10}$C that were obtained by fitting the decay
rates with multiple simple exponentials generally agreed well with the MC
expectations. We found a small excess of $^{10}$C in data compared to what was
predicted in MC, which was clear especially in the PE phantom.

The proposed scheme is developed in such a way that for each input it outputs

in the solar system. While some are clearly the result of known processes,
others still have largely unexplained eccentricity and inclination values.
Iapetus has a still unexplained 3% orbital eccentricity and its orbital plane
is tilted with respect to its local Laplace plane. On the other hand,
astrometric measurements of saturnian moons have revealed high tidal migration
rates, corresponding to a quality factor Q of Saturn of around 1600 for the
mid-sized icy moons. We show how a past crossing of the 5:1 mean motion
resonance between Titan and Iapetus may be a plausible scenario to explain
Iapetus' orbit. We have carried out numerical simulations of the resonance
crossing using an N-Body code as well as using averaged equations of motion. A
large span of migration rates were explored for Titan and Iapetus was started
on its local Laplace plane with a circular orbit. The resonance crossing can
trigger a chaotic evolution of the eccentricity and the inclination of Iapetus.
The outcome of the resonance is highly dependent on the migration rate. For a
quality factor Q of over around 2000, the chaotic evolution of Iapetus in the
resonance leads in most cases to its ejection, while simulations with a quality
factor between 100 and 2000 show a departure from the resonance with
post-resonant eccentricities spanning from 0 up to 15%, and free inclinations
capable of reaching 11 degrees. Usually high inclinations come with high
eccentricities but some simulations show elements compatible with Iapetus'
current orbit. A quality factor between 100 and 2000 at the frequency of Titan
would bring Titan and Iapetus into a 5:1 resonance, which would perturb
Iapetus' eccentricity and inclination to values observed today. Such rapid
tidal migration would have avoided Iapetus' ejection around 40 to 800 million
years ago.

large distances indeed $U(r)\sim r^{-3}$ for finite impurity masses, while for
the infinite impurity masses or in an external potential it crosses over to
$U(r)\sim r^{-1}$ . At short distances the Casimir interaction is not universal

of the important goals in statistical applications. In the literature, the
covariance between two random variables is a widely used criterion in measuring
the linear association between two random variables. In this paper, first we
propose a covariance based unified measure of variability for a continuous
random variable X and we show that several measures of variability and
uncertainty, such as variance, Gini mean difference, cumulative residual
entropy, etc., can be considered as special cases. Then, we propose a unified
measure of correlation between two continuous random variables X and Y, with
distribution functions (DFs) F and G, based on the covariance between X and
H^{-1}G(Y) (known as the Q-transformation of H on G) where H is a continuous

existing measures of correlation. Under some mild condition on H, it is shown
the suggested index ranges between [-1,1] where the extremes of the range,
i.e., -1 and 1, are attainable by the Frechet bivariate minimal and maximal
DFs, respectively. A special case of the proposed correlation measure leads to
a variant of Pearson correlation coefficient which, as a measure of strength

greater than or equal to the Pearson correlation. The results are examined

understanding of optimization algorithms widely used in signal processing,
statistics, and machine learning. Meanwhile, the famous Kuramoto model has been
an important mathematical model to study the synchronization phenomena of
coupled oscillators over various network topologies. In this paper, we bring
together these two seemingly unrelated objects by investigating the
optimization landscape of a nonlinear function $E(\boldsymbol{\theta}) =
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{1\leq i,j\leq n} a_{ij}(1-\cos(\theta_i - \theta_j))$
associated to an underlying network and exploring the relationship between the
existence of local minima and network topology. This function arises naturally
in Burer-Monteiro method applied to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ synchronization as well as
matrix completion on the torus. Moreover, it corresponds to the energy function
of the homogeneous Kuramoto model on complex networks for coupled oscillators.
We prove the minimizer of the energy function is unique up to a global
translation under deterministic dense graphs and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random
graphs with tools from optimization and random matrix theory. Consequently, the
stable equilibrium of the corresponding homogeneous Kuramoto model is unique
and the basin of attraction for the synchronous state of these coupled
oscillators is the whole phase space minus a set of measure zero. In addition,
our results address when the Burer-Monteiro method recovers the ground truth
exactly from highly incomplete observations in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ synchronization
and shed light on the robustness of nonconvex optimization algorithms against
certain types of so-called monotone adversaries. Numerical simulations are
performed to illustrate our results.

for computing the QR factorization of a tall-skinny matrix. Unfortunately it
has the inherent numerical instability and breakdown when the matrix is
ill-conditioned. A recent work establishes that the instability can be cured by
repeating the algorithm twice (called CholeskyQR2). However, the applicability
of CholeskyQR2 is still limited by the requirement that the Cholesky
factorization of the Gram matrix runs to completion, which means it does not
always work for matrices $X$ with $\kappa_2(X)\gtrsim {{\bf u}}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$
where ${{\bf u}}$ is the unit roundoff. In this work we extend the
applicability to $\kappa_2(X)=\mathcal{O}({\bf u}^{-1})$ by introducing a shift
to the computed Gram matrix so as to guarantee the Cholesky factorization
$R^TR= A^TA+sI$ succeeds numerically. We show that the computed $AR^{-1}$ has
reduced condition number $\leq {{\bf u}}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, for which CholeskyQR2
safely computes the QR factorization, yielding a computed $Q$ of orthogonality
$\|Q^TQ-I\|_2$ and residual $\|A-QR\|_F/\|A\|_F$ both $\mathcal{O}({{\bf u}})$.
Thus we obtain the required QR factorization by essentially running Cholesky QR
thrice. We extensively analyze the resulting algorithm shiftedCholeskyQR to
reveal its excellent numerical stability. shiftedCholeskyQR is also highly
parallelizable, and applicable and effective also when working in an oblique
inner product space. We illustrate our findings through experiments, in which

functional organization. One important goal in graph theoretical analysis of
brain networks is to identify network differences across disease types or
conditions. Typical approaches include massive univariate testing of each edge
or comparisons of local and/or global network metrics to identify deviations in
topological organization. Some limitations of these methods include low
statistical power due to the large number of comparisons and difficulty
attributing overall differences in networks to local variations in brain
function. We propose a novel differential degree test (DDT) to identify brain
regions incident to a large number of differentially weighted edges across two
populations. The proposed test could help detect key brain locations involved
in diseases by demonstrating significantly altered neural connections. We
achieve this by generating an appropriate set of null networks which are
matched on the first and second moments of the observed difference network
using the Hirschberger-Qi-Steuer (HQS) algorithm. This formulation permits
separation of the network's true topology from the nuisance topology which is
induced by the correlation measure and may drive inter-regional connectivity in
ways unrelated to the brain function. Simulations indicate that the proposed
approach routinely outperforms competing methods in detecting differentially
connected regions of interest. Furthermore, we propose a data-adaptive
threshold selection procedure which is able to detect differentially weighted
edges and is shown to outperform competing methods that perform edge-wise
comparisons controlling for the error rate. An application of our method to a
major depressive disorder dataset leads to the identification of brain regions
in the default mode network commonly implicated in this ruminative disorder.

first case the VMS stabilization method is used at both the full order and the
reduced order level. In the second case, the VMS stabilization is used only at
the full order level, while the projection of the standard Navier-Stokes
equations is performed instead at the reduced order level. The former method is
denoted as consistent ROM, while the latter is named non-consistent ROM, in
order to underline the different choices made at the two levels. Particular
attention is also devoted to the role of inf-sup stabilization by means of
supremizers in ROMs based on a VMS formulation. Finally, the developed methods
are tested on a numerical benchmark.

enhances the discovery potential. The computations are based on the so-called
Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) Dark Matter Model. This model was originally invented
as a natural explanation of the observed ratio $\Omega_{\rm dark} \sim
\Omega_{\rm visible}$ when the DM and visible matter densities assume the same
order of magnitude values, irrespectively to the axion mass $m_a$ or initial
misalignment angle $\theta_0$.This model, without adjustment of any parameters,
gives a very reasonable intensity of the extreme UV (EUV) radiation from the
solar corona as a result of the AQN annihilation events with the solar
material. This extra energy released in corona represents a resolution, within
AQN framework, a long standing puzzle known in the literature as the ""solar
corona heating mystery"". The same annihilation events also produce the axions.
The flux of these axions is unambiguously fixed in this model and expressed in
terms of the EUV luminosity from solar corona. We make few comments on the
potential discovery of these gravitationally bound axions.

Similarly to the black hole case, when quantum effects are taken into account,
a representation for $\Lambda$ is possible in terms of massless excitations,
provided that quantum corrections to the Misner-Sharp mass are considered.
Moreover, thanks to quantum fluctuations, an effective cosmological constant
arises depending on the physical scale under consideration, thus representing a
possible solution to the cosmological constant problem without introducing a
quintessence field. The smalness of the actual value for $\Lambda$ can be due
to the existence of a quantum decoherence scale above the Planck length such
that the spacetime evolves as a pure de Sitter universe with a small averaged
cosmological constant frozen in the lowest energy state.

Different evidence combination rules have been proposed in this framework
according to the properties of the sources to combine. However, most of these
combination rules are not efficient when there are a large number of sources.
This is due to either the complexity or the existence of an absorbing element
such as the total conflict mass function for the conjunctive based rules when
applied on unreliable evidence. In this paper, based on the assumption that the
majority of sources are reliable, a combination rule for a large number of
sources is proposed using a simple idea: the more common ideas the sources
share, the more reliable these sources are supposed to be. This rule is
adaptable for aggregating a large number of sources which may not all be
reliable. It will keep the spirit of the conjunctive rule to reinforce the
belief on the focal elements with which the sources are in agreement. The mass
on the emptyset will be kept as an indicator of the conflict. The proposed
rule, called LNS-CR (Conjunctive combinationRule for a Large Number of
Sources), is evaluated on synthetic mass functions. The experimental results
verify that the rule can be effectively used to combine a large number of mass
functions and to elicit the major opinion.

impossible due to volume conduction. The only viable alternative is to carry
out connectivity estimation in source space. Among the neuroscience community
this is claimed to be impossible or misleading due to Leakage: linear mixing of
the reconstructed sources. To address this problematic we propose a novel
solution method that caulks the Leakage in MEEG source activity and
connectivity estimates: BC-VARETA. It is based on a joint estimation of source
activity and connectivity in the frequency domain representation of MEEG time
series. To achieve this, we go beyond current methods that assume a fixed
gaussian graphical model for source connectivity. In contrast we estimate this
graphical model in a Bayesian framework by placing priors on it, which allows
for highly optimized computations of the connectivity, via a new procedure
based on the local quadratic approximation under quite general prior models. A
further contribution of this paper is the rigorous definition of leakage via
the Spatial Dispersion Measure and Earth Movers Distance based on the geodesic
distances over the cortical manifold. Both measures are extended for the first
time to quantify Connectivity Leakage by defining them on the cartesian product
of cortical manifolds. Using these measures, we show that BC-VARETA outperforms
most state of the art inverse solvers by several orders of magnitude.

representing $\Lambda$CDM with a certain late-time dark-matter density which
transitions to a reduced (present-day) density parameter at high $z$. We
statistically analyse constraints on cosmological parameters directly imposed
by the values of the standard co-moving ruler $r_d$ and the angular size of the
sound horizon $\theta_*$. Compared to the $\Lambda$CDM best fit to 2015 Planck
data, we require an increased (present-day) dark matter density when $r_d\cdot
H_0=$\,const and a value $H_0\sim 73.5$ km\,s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ -- typical for
local extractions -- are used. The ratio between the density parameters of
primordial and late-time dark matter ranges between 0.5 and 0.7. We confirm
this trend by fitting the predictions of SU(2)$_\CMB$, obtained from a modified
CLASS code, to the angular power spectra TT, TE, and EE. We consider adiabatic,
scalar primordial curvature perturbations and distinguish two treatments of
thermal quasi-particles in the perturbation equations. Best fits predict a
red-tilted primordial power spectrum. Moreover, a low baryon density is
obtained compared with the coincidence value of BBN, the $\Lambda$CDM best fit
of the 2015 Planck data, and the observed deuterium abundance. Our derived
values of $H_0$ support the results of local cosmological observations. Also,
there is a tendency for late reionisation.

intelligence (AI) based software, due to the technical complexity of the
software artifact and, often, its embedding in complex sociotechnical
processes. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) enabled by deep neural
networks has exacerbated the challenge of evaluating such software due to the
opaque nature of these ML-based artifacts. A key related issue is the
(in)ability of such systems to generate useful explanations of their outputs,
and we argue that the explanation and evaluation problems are closely linked.
The paper models the elements of a ML-based AI system in the context of public
sector decision (PSD) applications involving both artificial and human
intelligence, and maps these elements against issues in both evaluation and
explanation, showing how the two are related. We consider a number of common
PSD application patterns in the light of our model, and identify a set of key
issues connected to explanation and evaluation in each case. Finally, we
propose multiple strategies to promote wider adoption of AI/ML technologies in
PSD, where each is distinguished by a focus on different elements of our model,

  Processing at 2018.09.04",,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As 3D scanning devices and depth sensors mature, point clouds have attracted
increasing attention as a format for 3D object representation, with
applications in various fields such as tele-presence, navigation and heritage
reconstruction. However, point clouds usually exhibit holes of missing data,
mainly due to the limitation of acquisition techniques and complicated
structure. Further, point clouds are defined on irregular non-Euclidean
domains, which is challenging to address especially with conventional signal
processing tools. Hence, leveraging on recent advances in graph signal
processing, we propose an efficient point cloud inpainting method, exploiting
both the local smoothness and the non-local self-similarity in point clouds.
Specifically, we first propose a frequency interpretation in graph nodal
domain, based on which we introduce the local graph-signal smoothness prior in
order to describe the local smoothness of point clouds. Secondly, we explore
the characteristics of non-local self-similarity, by globally searching for the
most similar area to the missing region. The similarity metric between two
areas is defined based on the direct component and the anisotropic graph total
variation of normals in each area. Finally, we formulate the hole-filling step
as an optimization problem based on the selected most similar area and
regularized by the graph-signal smoothness prior. Besides, we propose
voxelization and automatic hole detection methods for the point cloud prior to
inpainting. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms
four competing methods significantly, both in objective and subjective quality.

applications. However, since communication is very expensive in these devices,
applications will require inference ""beyond the edge"" to avoid wasting precious
energy on pointless communication. We show that application performance is
highly sensitive to inference accuracy. Unfortunately, accurate inference
requires large amounts of computation and memory, and energy-harvesting systems
are severely resource-constrained. Moreover, energy-harvesting systems operate
intermittently, suffering frequent power failures that corrupt results and
impede forward progress.
  This paper overcomes these challenges to present the first full-scale
demonstration of DNN inference on an energy-harvesting system. We design and
implement SONIC, an intermittence-aware software system with specialized
support for DNN inference. SONIC introduces loop continuation, a new technique
that dramatically reduces the cost of guaranteeing correct intermittent
execution for loop-heavy code like DNN inference. To build a complete system,
we further present GENESIS, a tool that automatically compresses networks to
optimally balance inference accuracy and energy, and TAILS, which exploits SIMD
hardware available in some microcontrollers to improve energy efficiency. Both
SONIC & TAILS guarantee correct intermittent execution without any hand-tuning
or performance loss across different power systems. Across three neural
networks on a commercially available microcontroller, SONIC & TAILS reduce
inference energy by 6.9x and 12.2x, respectively, over the state-of-the-art.
