intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) for an anatomical delineation of the left
atrium and the pulmonary veins that enter the atrium. However, it is a
challenge to build an automatic contouring algorithm because ICE is noisy and
provides only a limited 2D view of the 3D anatomy. This work provides the first
automatic solution to segment the left atrium and the pulmonary veins from ICE.
In this solution, we demonstrate the benefit of building a cross-modality
framework that can leverage a database of diagnostic images to supplement the
less available interventional images. To this end, we develop a novel deep
neural network approach that uses the (i) 3D geometrical information provided
by a position sensor embedded in the ICE catheter and the (ii) 3D image
appearance information from a set of computed tomography cardiac volumes. We
evaluate the proposed approach over 11,000 ICE images collected from 150
clinical patients. Experimental results show that our model is significantly
better than a direct 2D image-to-image deep neural network segmentation,
especially for less-observed structures.

alleviate the first problem, we first extend a recently proposed adversarial

describing the data should be determined. Testing homogeneity is good for this
purpose; however, to construct its theory is challenging, since the test
statistic does not converge to the $\chi^{2}$ distribution even asymptotically.
The reason for such asymptotic behavior is that the parameter set describing
the null hypothesis (N.H.) contains singularities in the space of the
alternative hypothesis (A.H.). Recently, a $\it{Bayesian}$ theory for singular
models was developed, and it has elucidated various problems of statistical
inference. However, its application to hypothesis tests for singular models has
been limited. In this paper, we introduce a scaling technique that greatly
simplifies the derivation and study testing of homogeneity for the first time
the basis of Bayesian theory. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the
marginal likelihood ratios in three cases:
  (1) only the mixture ratio is a variable in the A.H. ;
  (2) the mixture ratio and the mean of the mixed distribution are variables;
  And (3) the mixture ratio, the mean, and the variance of the mixed
distribution are variables.; In all cases, the results are complex, but can be
described as functions of random variables obeying normal distributions. A
testing scheme based on them was constructed, and their validity was confirmed
through numerical experiments.

Additionally, we measure the scattering light intensity at the cuvette side
wall (scattering at 90 degrees angle). The obtained experimental data were
interpreted using the simulations of photon random walk in turbid media and
Kubelka-Munk approach. The scattering cross sections and indicatrices were
obtained by Mie theory.
  We discover that despite being very close to $\lambda^{-4}$ power law (like
Rayleigh scattering) the light extinction by the primary 4 nm diamond
crystallites is due to absorption only and scattering can be neglected. That is
the reason why previously absorption and scattering contributions were
confused. The scattering is governed only by the agglomerates of 100 nm and
larger in size remaining in the hydrosols and their fraction can be effectively
controlled by centrifugation. Only Mie theory reproduces correctly the close to
$\lambda^{-2}$ scattering by the agglomerates accounting for the weird
interplay between their size, fractal dimension, and dielectric properties.
Finally, using the obtained absorbance spectra we estimate the fraction of non

differential evolution (BDE), an optimization heuristic for binary decision
variables that was derived by Gong and Tuson (2007) from the very successful
classic differential evolution (DE) for continuous optimization. We show that
unlike most other optimization paradigms, it is stable in the sense that
neutral bit values are sampled with probability close to $1/2$ for a long time.
This is generally a desirable property, however, it makes it harder to find the
optima for decision variables with small influence on the objective function.
This can result in an optimization time exponential in the dimension when
optimizing simple symmetric functions like OneMax. On the positive side, BDE
quickly detects and optimizes the most important decision variables. For
example, dominant bits converge to the optimal value in time logarithmic in the
population size. This enables BDE to optimize the most important bits very
fast. Overall, our results indicate that BDE is an interesting optimization
paradigm having characteristics significantly different from classic
evolutionary algorithms or estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs).
  On the technical side, we observe that the strong stochastic dependencies in
the random experiment describing a run of BDE prevent us from proving all
desired results with the mathematical rigor that was successfully used in the
analysis of other evolutionary algorithms. Inspired by mean-field approaches in
statistical physics we propose a more independent variant of BDE, show
experimentally its similarity to BDE, and prove some statements rigorously only
for the independent variant. Such a semi-rigorous approach might be interesting
for other problems in evolutionary computation where purely mathematical

This mechanism is universal and can be implemented in a generic inflationary
scenario. Phenomenology of the model is comprised of Dark Matter decay into

integrated signal-to-noise ratio of 3.8, which, if confirmed by follow-up
observations, would represent the first strongly lensed and most distant
individual galaxy detected in HI emission. Two steps are performed to
transcribe the lensed integrated flux measurements into HI mass measurements
for all three target galaxies. First, we calculate the HI magnification factor
$\mu$ by applying general relativistic ray-tracing to a physical model of the
source-lens system. The HI magnification generally differs from the optical
magnification and depends largely on the intrinsic HI mass $M_{\rm HI}$ due to
the HI mass-size relation. Second, we employ a Bayesian formalism to convert
the integrated flux, amplified by the $M_{\rm HI}$-dependent magnification
factor $\mu$, into a probability density for $M_{\rm HI}$, accounting for the
asymmetric uncertainty due to the declining HI mass function (Eddington bias).
In this way, we determine a value of $\log_{\rm 10} (M_{\rm HI}/M_\odot) =
10.2^{+0.3}_{-0.7}$ for J1106+5228, consistent with the estimate of $9.4\pm0.3$
from the optical properties of this galaxy. The HI mass of the other two
sources are consistent with zero within a 95 per cent confidence interval

location. Specifically, we build a deep multi-task learning (MTL) framework to
jointly optimize skin lesion classification and body location classification
(the latter is used as an inductive bias). Our MTL framework uses the
state-of-the-art ImageNet pretrained model with specialized loss functions for
the two related tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed MTL based method
performs more robustly than its standalone (single-task) counterpart.

are uniform over scheduling policies, as well as the size n of the system. The
system is heavily loaded in the Halfin-Whitt regime, and the scheduling
policies are work-conserving and preemptive. We provide a unified approach via
a Lyapunov function method that establishes Foster-Lyapunov equations for both
the limiting diffusion and the prelimit diffusion-scaled queueing processes
simultaneously.
  We first study the limiting controlled diffusion, and we show that if the
spare capacity (safety staffing) parameter is positive, then the diffusion is
exponentially ergodic uniformly over all stationary Markov controls, and the
invariant probability measures have uniform exponential tails. This result is
sharp, since when there is no abandonment and the spare capacity parameter is
negative, then the controlled diffusion is transient under any Markov control.
In addition, we show that if all the abandonment rates are positive, the
invariant probability measures have sub-Gaussian tails, regardless whether the
spare capacity parameter is positive or negative.
  Using the above results, we proceed to establish the corresponding ergodic
properties for the diffusion-scaled queueing processes. In addition to
providing a simpler proof of the results in Gamarnik and Stolyar [Queueing Syst
(2012) 71:25-51], we extend these results to the multiclass models with renewal
arrival processes, albeit under the assumption that the mean residual life
functions are bounded. For the Markovian model with Poisson arrivals, we obtain
stronger results and show that the convergence to the stationary distribution
is at an exponential rate uniformly over all work-conserving stationary Markov
scheduling policies.

static conditions, a softer EoS (including hyperons) can also lead to massive
stellar configurations of NSs, which are in well agreement with the observed
maximum mass bound of $\approx 2 M_{\odot}$ (PSR J0348-0432). Estimates of

quickly from trusted, conspiracy, and disinformation sources compared to
clickbait and propaganda. Older users propagate news from trusted sources more
quickly than younger users, but they share from suspicious sources after longer
delays. Finally, users who interact with clickbait and conspiracy sources are
likely to share from propaganda accounts, but not the other way around.

the development of new theory of economic dynamics. Traditionally, economic
growth is modeled with a few aggregate quantities derived from simplified
theoretical models. Here, PriSDA identifies important quantities. Applied to 55
years of data on countries' exports, PriSDA finds that what most distinguishes
countries' export baskets is their diversity, with extra weight assigned to
more sophisticated products. The weights are consistent with previous measures
of product complexity in the literature. The second dimension of variation is a
proficiency in machinery relative to agriculture. PriSDA then couples these
quantities with per-capita income and infers the dynamics of the system over
time. According to PriSDA, the pattern of economic development of countries is
dominated by a tendency toward increased diversification. Moreover, economies
appear to become richer after they diversify (i.e., diversity precedes growth).
The model predicts that middle-income countries with diverse export baskets
will grow the fastest in the coming decades, and that countries will converge
onto intermediate levels of income and specialization. PriSDA is generalizable
and may illuminate dynamics of elusive quantities such as diversity and
complexity in other natural and social systems.

Adamczak (2015), which holds under certain rather strong assumptions on the
distribution of $X$. We provide several applications of our techniques: we
establish a version of the standard Hanson-Wright inequality, which is tighter
in some regimes. Extending our techniques we show a version of the
dimension-free matrix Bernstein inequality that holds for random matrices with
a subexponential spectral norm. We apply the derived inequality to the problem
of covariance estimation with missing observations and prove an almost optimal
high probability version of the recent result of Lounici (2014). Finally, we
show a uniform Hanson-Wright type inequality in the Ising model under
Dobrushin's condition. A closely related question was posed by Marton (2003).

intrinsic noise in subdiffusive systems. This results in corrections to the
deterministic fractional reaction-diffusion equations. Using this analytical
approach, we study the onset of noise-driven quasi-patterns in
reaction-subdiffusion systems. We find that subdiffusion can be conducive to
the formation of both deterministic and stochastic patterns. Our analysis shows
that the combination of subdiffusion and intrinsic stochasticity can reduce the

are classified in terms of the number of nodes of the scalar field. It was then

higher order power of $\phi$ in the coupling function $\xi(\phi)$ affects the

the complexity of the digital back propagation (DBP) algorithm. However,
compared with nondispersion-managed (NDM) links, dispersion-managed (DM) ones
suffer a stronger cross-phase modulation (XPM). Utilizing per-channel
dispersion-managed (CDM) links (e.g., using fiber Bragg grating) allows for a
complexity reduction of DBP, while abating XPM compared to DM links. In this
paper, we show for the first time that CDM links enable also a more effective
XPM compensation compared to NDM ones, allowing a higher achievable information
rate (AIR). This is explained by resorting to the frequency-resolved
logarithmic perturbation model and showing that per-channel dispersion
compensation increases the frequency correlation of the distortions induced by
XPM over the channel bandwidth, making them more similar to a conventional
phase noise. We compare the performance (in terms of the AIR) of a DM, an NDM,
and a CDM link, considering two types of mismatched receivers: one neglects the
XPM phase distortion and the other compensates for it. With the former, the CDM
link is inferior to the NDM one due to an increased in-band signal--noise
interaction. However, with the latter, a higher AIR is obtained with the CDM
link than with the NDM one owing to a higher XPM frequency correlation. The DM
link has the lowest AIR for both receivers because of a stronger XPM.

to prefer physical theories with deterministic dynamical equations: such

(2) There is a clear way how to introduce probabilities in a deterministic
physical theory, namely as answer to the question of what evolution of a
specific system we can reasonably expect under ignorance of its exact initial
conditions. This procedure works in the same manner for both classical and
quantum physics. (3) There is no cogent reason to take the parameters that
enter into the (deterministic) dynamical equations of physics to refer to
properties of the physical systems. Granting an ontological status to
parameters such as mass, charge, wave functions and the like does not lead to a
gain in explanation, but only to artificial problems. Against this background,
I argue that there is no conflict between determinism in physics and free will

Hutchinson's concept of niche interaction to networked cooperative species.
Their niche relation evolves under the assumption of fitness maximization.
Modularity and nestedness emerge concurrently through the accumulated local
advantages in the structural and demographic distribution. A rich ensemble of
key dynamical behaviors are unveiled in the dynamical framework. We demonstrate
that mutualism can exhibit either a stabilizing or destabilizing effect on the
evolved network, which undergoes a drastic transition with the overall
competition level. Most strikingly, the adaptive network may exhibit a profound
nature of history-dependency in response to environmental changes, allowing it
to be found in alternative stable structures. The adaptive nature of niche
interactions, as captured in our framework, can underlie a broad class of
ecological relations and also socio-economic networks that engage in bipartite

the Lisp family that targets the JVM. Typed Clojure enables Clojure programmers
to gain greater confidence in the correctness of their code via static type
checking while remaining in the Clojure world, and has acquired significant
adoption in the Clojure community. Typed Clojure repurposes Typed Racket's
occurrence typing, an approach to statically reasoning about predicate tests,
and also includes several new type system features to handle existing Clojure
idioms. In this paper, we describe Typed Clojure and present these type system
extensions, focusing on three features widely used in Clojure. First,
multimethods provide extensible operations, and their Clojure semantics turns
out to have a surprising synergy with the underlying occurrence typing
framework. Second, Java interoperability is central to Clojure's mission but
introduces challenges such as ubiquitous null; Typed Clojure handles Java
interoperability while ensuring the absence of null-pointer exceptions in typed
programs. Third, Clojure programmers idiomatically use immutable dictionaries
for data structures; Typed Clojure handles this with multiple forms of
heterogeneous dictionary types. We provide a formal model of the Typed Clojure
type system incorporating these and other features, with a proof of soundness.
Additionally, Typed Clojure is now in use by numerous corporations and
developers working with Clojure, and we present a quantitative analysis on the
use of type system features in two substantial code bases.

charges of the proton using 11 ensembles of 2+1+1 flavor HISQ fermions. In the
isospin symmetric limit, results for the neutron are given by the $u

corrections was made to extract the connected and disconnected contributions in
the continuum limit and at $M_\pi=135$ MeV. All results are given in the
$\overline{MS}$ scheme at 2 GeV. The isovector charges, $g_A^{u-d} =
1.218(25)(30)$, $g_S^{u-d} = 1.022(80)(60) $ and $g_T^{u-d} = 0.989(32)(10)$,
are used to obtain low-energy constraints on novel scalar and tensor
interactions, $\epsilon_{S}$ and $\epsilon_{T}$, at the TeV scale. The flavor
diagonal axial charges are: $g_A^u \equiv \Delta u \equiv \langle 1

contribution to the proton spin, $\sum_{q=u,d,s} (\frac{1}{2} \Delta q) =
0.143(31)(36)$. This result is in good agreement with the recent COMPASS

the flavor diagonal tensor charges, $g_T^u = 0.784(28)(10)$, $g_T^d =
-0.204(11)(10)$ and $g_T^s = -0.0027(16)$ for constraining the quark electric

constraints on the electric charge associated with the Galactic centre black
hole - Sgr A*. According to the no-hair theorem, every astrophysical black
hole, including supermassive black holes, is characterized by at most three
classical, externally observable parameters - mass, spin, and the electric
charge. While the mass and the spin have routinely been measured by several
methods, the electric charge has usually been neglected, based on the arguments
of efficient discharge in astrophysical plasmas. From a theoretical point of
view, the black hole can attain charge due to the mass imbalance between
protons and electrons in fully ionized plasmas, which yields about $\sim
10^8\,{\rm C}$ for Sgr A*. The second, induction mechanism concerns rotating
Kerr black holes embedded in an external magnetic field, which leads to
electric field generation due to the twisting of magnetic field lines. This
electric field can be associated with the induced Wald charge, for which we
calculate the upper limit of $\sim 10^{15}\,{\rm C}$ for Sgr A*. Although the
maximum theoretical limit of $\sim 10^{15}\,{\rm C}$ is still 12 orders of
magnitude smaller than the extremal charge of Sgr A*, we analyse a few
astrophysical consequences of having a black hole with a small charge in the
Galactic centre. Two most prominent ones are the effect on the X-ray
bremsstrahlung profile and the effect on the position of the innermost stable
circular orbit.

revolutionising our understanding of the Universe. However, ALMA is not yet
equipped with all of its originally planned receiver bands, which will allow it
to observe over the full range of frequencies from 35-950 GHz accessible
through the Earth's atmosphere. In particular Band 2 (67-90 GHz) has not yet
been approved for construction. Recent technological developments in cryogenic
monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) high electron mobility
transistor (HEMT) amplifier and orthomode transducer (OMT) design provide an
opportunity to extend the originally planned on-sky bandwidth, combining ALMA
Bands 2 and 3 into one receiver cartridge covering 67-116 GHz.
  The IF band definition for the ALMA project took place two decades ago, when
8 GHz of on-sky bandwidth per polarisation channel was an ambitious goal. The
new receiver design we present here allows the opportunity to expand ALMA's
wideband capabilities, anticipating future upgrades across the entire
observatory. Expanding ALMA's instantaneous bandwidth is a high priority, and
provides a number of observational advantages, including lower noise in
continuum observations, the ability to probe larger portions of an astronomical
spectrum for, e.g., widely spaced molecular transitions, and the ability to
scan efficiently in frequency space to perform surveys where the redshift or
chemical complexity of the object is not known a priori. Wider IF bandwidth
also reduces uncertainties in calibration and continuum subtraction that might
otherwise compromise science objectives.
  Here we provide an overview of the component development and overall design
for this wideband 67-116 GHz cryogenic receiver cartridge, designed to operate
from the Band 2 receiver cartridge slot in the current ALMA front end receiver
cryostat.

polylogarithmic in the number of datapoints $N$. Our algorithm provides
substantial savings compared to the classical $k$-means algorithm that runs in

algebras $A^*$ of a non-homogeneous commutative Artinian Gorenstein (AG)
algebra $A$. This decomposition arises from the stratification of $A^*$ by a
sequence of ideals $A^*=C_A(0)\supset C_A(1)\supset\cdots$ whose successive
quotients $Q(a)=C(a)/C(a+1)$ are reflexive $A^*$ modules. These were introduced
by the first author, and have been used more recently by several groups,
especially those interested in short Gorenstein algebras, and in the scheme
length (cactus rank) of forms.
  For us a Gorenstein sequence is an integer sequence $H$ occurring as the
Hilbert function for an AG algebra $A$, that is not necessarily homogeneous.
Such a Hilbert function $H(A)$ is the sum of symmetric non-negative sequences
$H_A(a)=H(Q_A(a))$, each having center of symmetry $(j-a)/2$ where $j$ is the
socle degree of $A$: we call these the symmetry conditions, and the
decomposition $\mathcal{D}(A)=(H_A(0),H_A(1),\ldots)$ the symmetric
decomposition of $H(A)$.
  We here study which sequences may occur as the summands $H_A(a)$: in
particular we construct in a systematic way examples of AG algebras $A$ for
which $H_A(a)$ can have interior zeroes, as $H_A(a)=(0,s,0,\ldots,0,s,0)$. We
also study the symmetric decomposition sets $\mathcal{D}(A)$, and in particular

post-processing step. We show that the proposed approach achieves better
performance than the conventional multi-stage refinement models and

(1) non-vanishing of modular symbols at infinity and (2) the existance or
construction of uniform cohomological test vectors. Problem (1) is also called
the non-vanishing hypothesis at infinity, which was proved by Binyong Sun, by
establishing the existence of certain cohomological test vectors.

management of crypto-tokens have become critical. We have witnessed many
attacks on users and providers, which have resulted in significant financial
losses. To remedy these issues, several wallet solutions have been proposed.
However, these solutions often lack either essential security features,
usability, or do not allow users to customize their spending rules.
  In this paper, we propose SmartOTPs, a smart-contract wallet framework that
gives a flexible, usable, and secure way of managing crypto-tokens in a
self-sovereign fashion. The proposed framework consists of four components
(i.e., an authenticator, a client, a hardware wallet, and a smart contract),
and it provides 2-factor authentication (2FA) performed in two stages of
interaction with the blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is
the first one that utilizes one-time passwords (OTPs) in the setting of the
public blockchain. In SmartOTPs, the OTPs are aggregated by a Merkle tree and
hash chains whereby for each authentication only a short OTP (e.g., 16B-long)
is transferred from the authenticator to the client. Such a novel setting
enables us to make a fully air-gapped authenticator by utilizing small QR codes
or a few mnemonic words, while additionally offering resilience against quantum
cryptanalysis. We have made a proof-of-concept based on the Ethereum platform.
Our cost analysis shows that the average cost of a transfer operation is
comparable to existing 2FA solutions using smart contracts with
multi-signatures.

exponentially with system size or requiring specific knowledge of spectral
properties \textit{a priori}. Also, these algorithms require a large overhead
of bath or scratch/ancilla qubits. We propose a method, termed the minimal
effective Gibbs ansatz (MEGA), which uses a quantum computer to determine a
minimal ensemble of pure states that accurately reproduce thermal averages of
typical observables. This technique employs properties of correlation functions
that can be split into a lesser and greater part; here, we primarily focus on
single-particle Green's functions. When properly measured, these correlation
functions provide a simple test to indicate how close a given pure state or
ensemble of pure states are to providing accurate thermal expectation values.
Further, we show that when properties such as the eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis hold, this approach leads to accurate results with a sparse ensemble
of pure states; sometimes only one suffices. We illustrate the ansatz using
exact diagonalization simulations on small clusters for the Fermi-Hubbard and
Hubbard-like models. Even if MEGA becomes as computationally complex as other
Gibbs state samplers, it still gains an advantage due to its ease of
implementation without any \textit{a priori} information about the Hamiltonian
and in the efficient allocation of available qubits by eliminating bath qubits
and using a minimal number of ancilla.

for solving partial differential equations in complex geometries because of its
simplicity and flexibility. In this method the complex geometry is embedded
into a larger, regular domain. The original PDE is reformulated using a
smoothed characteristic function of the complex domain and source terms are
introduced to approximate the boundary conditions. The reformulated equation,
which is independent of the dimension and domain geometry, can be solved by
standard numerical methods and the same solver can be used for any domain
geometry. A challenge is making the method higher-order accurate. For Dirichlet
boundary conditions, which we focus on here, current implementations
demonstrate a wide range in their accuracy but generally the methods yield at
best first order accuracy in $\epsilon$, the parameter that characterizes the
width of the region over which the characteristic function is smoothed.
Typically, $\epsilon\propto h$, the grid size. Here, we analyze the
diffuse-domain PDEs using matched asymptotic expansions and explain the
observed behaviors. Our analysis also identifies simple modifications to the
diffuse-domain PDEs that yield higher-order accuracy in $\epsilon$, e.g.,
$O(\epsilon^2)$ in the $L^2$ norm and $O(\epsilon^p)$ with $1.5\le p\le 2$ in
the $L^{\infty}$ norm. Our analytic results are confirmed numerically in
stationary and moving domains where the level set method is used to capture the
dynamics of the domain boundary and to construct the smoothed characteristic

the ensemble detections that obtains higher mAP than the ensemble itself. The
second (specialized) knowledge source comes from training a detector (which we
call the Supervised Labeler) on a labeled subset of the video to generate
detections on the unlabeled portion. We demonstrate on two popular vehicular
datasets that these techniques work to emit bounding boxes for all vehicles in
the frame with higher mean average precision (mAP) than any of the reference
networks used, and that the combination of ensembled and human-labeled data
produces object detections that outperform either alone.

The user equipment employs a fully digital front end to detect the

The key ingredient of the proposed methods is the custom designed
synchronization sequence pairs, from which there exists an invertible function
(a ratio metric) of the carrier frequency offset (CFO) to be estimated. We use
numerical examples to show that the ratio metric is robust to the quantization
distortion. Further, we analytically characterize the CFO estimation
performances of our proposed designs assuming a single user. To implement our
proposed methods in a multi-user scenario, we propose to optimize the
double-sequence design parameters such that: (i) for each individual user, the
impact of the quantization distortion on the CFO estimation accuracy is
minimized, and (ii) the resulting frequency range of estimation can capture as
many users' CFOs as possible. Numerical results reveal that our proposed
algorithms provide a flexible means to estimate CFO in a variety of

Answering where large diagnostic datasets have been proposed to test a system's

distillation (teacher-student framework), relational reasoning and
probabilistic logical languages to incorporate such knowledge in existing
neural networks for the task of Visual Question Answering. Specifically, for a
question posed against an image, we use a probabilistic logical language to
encode the spatial knowledge and the spatial understanding about the question
in the form of a mask that is directly provided to the teacher network. The
student network learns from the ground-truth information as well as the
teachers prediction via distillation. We also demonstrate the impact of
predicting such a mask inside the teachers network using attention.
Empirically, we show that both the methods improve the test accuracy over a

proposed to be one of the potential candidates of dark matter. In this work we
investigate the updated solar neutrino data available from all the relevant
experiments including Borexino and KamLAND solar phase in a model independent
way, and obtain bounds on the sterile neutrino component present in the solar
neutrino flux. The mystery of the missing neutrinos is further deepening as
subsequent experiments are coming up with their results. The energy spectrum of
solar neutrinos, as predicted by Standard Solar Models (SSM), is seen by
neutrino experiments at different parts as they are sensitive to various
neutrino energy ranges. It is interesting to note that more than $98\%$ of the
calculated standard model solar neutrino flux lies below $1MeV$. Therefore, the
study of low energy neutrinos can give us better understanding and the
possibility to know about the presence of antineutrino and sterile neutrino
components in solar neutrino flux. As such, this work becomes interesting as we
include the data from medium energy ($\sim 1MeV$) experiments i.e. Borexino and

performing universal quantum computation, within the NISQ era limitations, we
propose to merge digital single-qubit operations with analog multi-qubit
entangling blocks in an approach we call digital-analog quantum computing
(DAQC). Along these lines, although the techniques may be extended to any
resource, we propose to use unitaries generated by the ubiquitous Ising
Hamiltonian for the analog entangling block and we prove its universal
character. We construct explicit DAQC protocols for efficient simulations of
arbitrary inhomogeneous Ising, two-body, and $M$-body spin Hamiltonian dynamics
by means of single-qubit gates and a fixed homogeneous Ising Hamiltonian.
Additionally, we compare a sequential approach where the interactions are
switched on and off (stepwise~DAQC) with an always-on multi-qubit interaction
interspersed by fast single-qubit pulses (banged DAQC). Finally, we perform
numerical tests comparing purely digital schemes with DAQC protocols, showing a
remarkably better performance of the latter. The proposed DAQC approach
combines the robustness of analog quantum computing with the flexibility of

and flow velocity fields in a blast wave propagating through a medium at rest,
following an intense explosion, starting from hydrodynamic equations, is one of
the classic problems in gas dynamics. However, there is very little direct
verification of the theory and its assumptions from simulations of microscopic
models. In this paper, we compare the results and assumptions of the
hydrodynamic theory with results from large scale event driven molecular
dynamics simulations of a hard sphere gas in three dimensions. We find that the
predictions for the radial distribution of the thermodynamic quantities do not
match well with the numerical data. We improve the theory by replacing the
ideal gas law with a more realistic virial equation of state for the hard
sphere gas. While this improves the theoretical predictions, we show that they
still fail to describe the data well. To understand the reasons for this
discrepancy, the different assumptions of the hydrodynamic theory are tested
within the simulations. A key assumption of the theory is the existence of a
local equation of state. We validate this assumption by showing that the local
pressure, temperature and density obey the equation of state for a hard sphere
gas. However, the probability distribution of the velocity fluctuations has
non-gaussian tails, especially away from the shock front, showing that the
assumption of local equilibrium is violated. This, along with neglect of heat
conduction, could be the possible reasons for the mismatch between theory and
simulations.

However, the heterogeneity and complexity of the underlying ITS networks raise
new challenges in intrusion prevention of mobile network nodes and detection of

simulation and a semi-analytic model (SAM) grafted in the halo merger trees
from the Illustris-Dark matter simulation. Morphology is classified according
to the luminous profile and the kinematic bulge-to-total ratio for Illustris
galaxy, and the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio for SAM galaxy. For late-type
galaxies in the Illustris catalogue, most of their counterparts in the SAM
model have the same type, and the consistency between two models is higher for
lower mass galaxies. For early-type (ET) galaxies in Illustris, the consistency
is quite low for the counterparts except for most massive galaxies. By
comparing in detail the growth histories of some matched galaxy pairs of Milky
Way mass in Illustris and the SAM model, we notice two aspects of differences
in determining galaxy morphology between the two galaxy formation
implementations. First, in the SAM, major merger and frequent minor mergers
result in the growth of bulges and turn the galaxy into ET, while bulge
formation is not connected to mergers as tightly as in SAM for the Illustris
galaxies. In addition, the satellite stellar mass can decrease significantly
due to tidal stripping before merging into the central galaxy in Illustris,
while it does not decrease in the SAM model. This results in less mergers with
large (stellar) mass ratios in the Illustris simulation, and less effect of
mergers on shaping galaxy morphology.

articulated objects, such as tools, cabinets, and other jointed objects. Such
articulated objects can take an infinite number of possible poses, as a point
in a potentially high-dimensional continuous space. A robot must perceive this
continuous pose to manipulate the object to a desired pose. This problem of
perception and manipulation of articulated objects remains a challenge due to
its high dimensionality and multi-modal uncertainty. In this paper, we propose
a factored approach to estimate the poses of articulated objects using an
efficient nonparametric belief propagation algorithm. We consider inputs as
geometrical models with articulation constraints, and observed RGBD sensor
data. The proposed framework produces object-part pose beliefs iteratively. The
problem is formulated as a pairwise Markov Random Field (MRF) where each hidden
node (continuous pose variable) is an observed object-part's pose and the edges
denote the articulation constraints between the parts. We propose articulated
pose estimation by Pull Message Passing algorithm for Nonparametric Belief
Propagation (PMPNBP) and evaluate its convergence properties over scenes with
articulated objects.

context of time-harmonic elastodynamics. This inverse problem is formulated as
the minimization of the modified error in constitutive equation (MECE), an
energy-based cost functional defined as an weighted additive combination
$\mathcal{E}+\kappa\mathcal{D}$ of the error in constitutive equation (ECE)
$\mathcal{E}$, expressed using an energy seminorm, and a quadratic error term
$\mathcal{D}$ incorporating the kinematical measurements. MECE-based
identification are known from existing computational evidence to enjoy
attractive properties such as improved convexity, robustness to resonant
frequencies, and tolerance to incompletely specified boundary conditions (BCs).
The main goal of this work is to develop theoretical foundations, in a
continuous setting, allowing to explain and justify some of the aforementioned
beneficial properties, in particular addressing the general case where BCs may
be underspecified. A specific feature of MECE formulations is that forward and
adjoint solutions are governed by a fully coupled system, whose mathematical
properties play a fundamental role in the qualitative and computational aspects
of MECE minimization. We prove that this system has a unique and stable
solution at any frequency, provided data is abundant enough (in a sense made
precise therein) to at least compensate for any missing information on BCs. As
a result, our formulation leads in such situations to a well-defined solution
even though the relevant forward problem is not \emph{a priori} clearly
defined. This result has practical implications such as applicability of MECE
to partial interior data (with important practical applications including
ultrasound elastography), convergence of finite element discretizations and
differentiability of the reduced MECE functional. In addition, we establish
that usual least squares and pure ECE formulations are limiting cases of MECE
formulations for small and large values of $\kappa$, respectively. For the
latter case, which corresponds to exact enforcement of kinematic data, we
furthermore show that the reduced MECE Hessian is asymptotically positive for
any parameter perturbation supported on the measurement region, thereby
corroborating existing computational evidence on convexity improvement brought
by MECE functionals. Finally, numerical studies that support and illustrate our
theoretical findings, including a parameter reconstruction example using
interior data, are presented.

particular, prior work on hypothesis testing in time series has been restricted
to linear Gaussian auto-regressive models. From a practical perspective, it is
important to determine suitable statistical tests for connections between
actors that go beyond the Gaussian assumption. In the context of
\emph{high-dimensional} time series models, confidence intervals present
additional estimators since most estimators such as the Lasso and Dantzig

paper we address these challenges and provide convergence in distribution

challenge lies in the fact that unlike Gaussian random vectors, for

relies on using an intricate truncation argument to develop novel concentration
bounds for quadratic forms of dependent sub-Gaussian random variables. Our
convergence in distribution results hold provided $T = \Omega((s \vee \rho)^2

  https://github.com/Sha-Lab/FEAT",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning with limited data is a key challenge for visual recognition. Many
few-shot learning methods address this challenge by learning an instance
embedding function from seen classes and apply the function to instances from
unseen classes with limited labels. This style of transfer learning is
task-agnostic: the embedding function is not learned optimally discriminative
with respect to the unseen classes, where discerning among them leads to the
target task. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to adapt the instance
embeddings to the target classification task with a set-to-set function,
yielding embeddings that are task-specific and are discriminative. We
empirically investigated various instantiations of such set-to-set functions
and observed the Transformer is most effective -- as it naturally satisfies key
properties of our desired model. We denote this model as FEAT (few-shot
embedding adaptation w/ Transformer) and validate it on both the standard
few-shot classification benchmark and four extended few-shot learning settings
with essential use cases, i.e., cross-domain, transductive, generalized
few-shot learning, and low-shot learning. It archived consistent improvements
over baseline models as well as previous methods and established the new
state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks.

time-periodic perturbations. When the perturbation parameter is set to zero,
the energy of the system is preserved. This is no longer the case when the
perturbation parameter is non-zero. We describe a topological method to
establish orbits which diffuse in energy for every suitably small perturbation
parameter $\varepsilon>0$. The method yields quantitative estimates: (i) The
existence of orbits along which the energy drifts by an amount independent of
$\varepsilon$. The time required by such orbits to drift is $O(1/\varepsilon)$;
(ii) The existence of orbits along which the energy makes chaotic excursions;
(iii) Explicit estimates for the Hausdorff dimension of the set of such chaotic
orbits; (iv) The existence of orbits along which the time evolution of energy
approaches a stopped diffusion process (Brownian motion with drift), as
$\varepsilon$ tends to $0$. For each $\varepsilon$ fixed, the set of initial
conditions of the orbits that yield the diffusion process has positive Lebesgue
measure, and in the limit the measure of these sets approaches zero. Moreover,
we can obtain any desired values of the drift and variance for the limiting
Brownian motion, for appropriate sets of initial conditions. A key feature of
our topological method is that it can be implemented in computer assisted
proofs. We give an application to a concrete model of the planar elliptic
restricted three-body problem, on the motion of an infinitesimal body relative
to the Neptune-Triton system.

reflected in the fact that the inner-scaled wall-normal velocity is larger on

located at the nodes of the cosmic web, and continue to accrete galaxies and
groups along filaments. They show sometimes a very large extension and a
preferential direction. Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are believed to grow
through the accretion of many small galaxies, and their structural properties
are expected to vary with redshift. In some cases BCGs show an orientation
comparable to that of the cluster to which they belong. We analyse the
morphological properties of 38 BCGs from the DAFT/FADA and CLASH surveys and
compare the position angles of their major axes to the direction of the cluster
elongation at Mpc scale. The morphological properties of the BCGs were studied
by applying the GALFIT software to HST images and fitting the light
distribution with one or two Sersic laws, or with a Nuker plus a Sersic law.
The cluster elongations were estimated by computing density maps of red
sequence galaxies. The analysis of the 38 BCGs shows that in 11 cases a single
Sersic law is sufficient to account for the surface brightness, while for all
the other clusters two laws are necessary. For the outer Sersic component, the
effective radius increases with decreasing redshift, and the effective surface
brightness decreases with effective radius, following the Kormendy law. An
agreement between the major axis of the BCG and the cluster elongation at large
scale within +-30 deg is found for 12 clusters out of the 21 for which both PAs
can be defined. The variation with redshift of the effective radius of the
outer Sersic component agrees with the growing of BCGs by accretion of smaller
galaxies from z=0.9 to 0.2. The directions of the elongations of BCGs and of
their host clusters and large scale structures agree for 12 objects out of 21,
implying that a larger sample is necessary to reach more definite conclusions.

very-high-resolution spectra obtained with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and
Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) at the Large Binocular Telescope. Changes in
spectral line profiles are inverted to a stellar surface temperature map using
our $i$Map code. The long-term photometric record is employed to compare our
map with previously published maps. Four cool spots were reconstructed, but no
polar spot was seen. The temperature difference to the photosphere of the spots
is between 990 and 280K. Two spots are reconstructed with a typical solar
morphology with an umbra and a penumbra. For the one isolated and relatively
round spot (A), we determine an umbral temperature of 990K and a penumbral
temperature of 180K below photospheric temperature. The umbra to photosphere
intensity ratio of EK Dra is approximately only half of that of a comparison
sunspot. A test inversion from degraded line profiles showed that the higher
spectral resolution of PEPSI reconstructs the surface with a temperature
difference that is on average 10% higher than before and with smaller surface
areas by 10-20%. PEPSI is therefore better suited to detecting and
characterising temperature inhomogeneities. With ten more years of photometry,
we also refine the spot cycle period of EK Dra to 8.9$\pm$0.2 years with a
continuing long-term fading trend. The temperature morphology of spot A so far
appears to show the best evidence for the existence of a solar-like penumbra
for a starspot. We emphasise that it is more the non-capture of the true umbral
contrast rather than the detection of the weak penumbra that is the limiting
factor. The relatively small line broadening of EK Dra, together with the only
moderately high spectral resolutions previously available, appear to be the
main contributors to the lower-than-expected spot contrasts when comparing to
the Sun.

well-resolved large-eddy simulations (LES) with the goal of assessing the
influence of the streamwise pressure development. Near-equilibrium boundary
layers were identified with the Clauser parameter $\beta$. The pressure
gradient is imposed by prescribing the free-stream velocity. In order to
fulfill the near-equilibrium conditions, the free-stream velocity has to follow
a power-law distribution. The turbulence statistics pertaining to cases with a
constant Clauser pressure-gradient parameter ? were compared with cases with a
non-constant pressure distribution at matched ? and friction Reynolds number
Re_tau . It was noticed that the non-constant cases appear to approach far
downstream a certain state of the boundary layer, which is uniquely
characterised by beta? and Re_tau. The investigations on the flat plate were
extended to the flow around a wing section. Comparisons with the flat-plate
cases at matched Re_tau and ? revealed some interesting features: In turbulent
boundary layers with strong pressure gradients in the development history the
energy-carrying structures in the outer region are strongly enhanced, which can
be detected by the pronounced wake in the mean velocity as well as the large
second peak in the Reynolds stresses. Furthermore, a scaling law suggested by
Kitsios et al. (2015), proposing the edge velocity and displacement thickness
as scaling parameters, was tested on a constant pressure gradient case. The
mean velocity and Reynolds stress profiles were found to be dependent on the
downstream development, indicating that their conclusion might be the result of
a too short constant pressure gradient region.

amplitudes between the $d$-orbitals due to copper and $p_x/p_y$ orbitals due to
oxygen are analyzed together with the hybrid $d$-$p$ pairing. The $d$-$d$
pairing between the nearest neighboring atomic sites leads to the dominant
contribution to the SC phase. Moreover, it is shown that the decrease of both
the Coulomb repulsion on the copper atomic sites ($U_d$) and the charge
transfer energy between the oxygen and copper atomic sites ($\epsilon_{dp}$)
increases the pairing strength as it moves the system from the strong to the
intermediate-correlation regime, where the pairing is maximized. Such a result
is consistent with our analysis of the ratio of changes in the hole content at
the $d$ and $p$ orbitals due to doping, which, according to experimental study,
increases with the increasing maximal critical temperature [cf. Nat. Commun. 7,
11413 (2016)]. Furthermore, the results for the three-band model are compared
to those for the effective single-band picture and similarities between the two
approaches are discussed. For the sake of completeness, the normal-state
characteristics determined from the DE-GWF approach are compared with those

noise power spectral density of the RF beat note generated by the two modes
undergoes a drastic reduction of about 10 to 20 dB throughout the whole
frequency range from 10 kHz to 20 MHz and falls below the detection floor above
a few MHz. A good agreement is found with a model which uses the framework of
rate equations coupled by cross--saturation. The remaining phase noise is
attributed to thermal effects and additional technical noises and lies mainly
within the bandwidth of a phase-locked-loop.

AOA, for the first time measured by LA-ICP-MS, is consistent with a
condensation origin although the shallow slope of its rare earth element (REE)
pattern has yet to be physically explained. Ferromagnesian silicates in type I
chondrules resemble those in other carbonaceous chondrites both geochemically
and isotopically, and we find a correlation between 16O enrichment and many
incompatible elements in olivine. The variation in incompatible element
concentrations may relate to varying amounts of olivine crystallization during
a sub-isothermal stage of chondrule-forming events, the duration of which may
be anticorrelated with the local solid/gas ratio if this was the determinant of
oxygen isotopic ratios as recently proposed. While aqueous alteration has
depleted many chondrule mesostases in REE, some chondrules show recognizable
subdued group II-like patterns supporting the idea that the immediate
precursors of chondrules were nebular condensates.

uses an embedding representation that we call domain embedding for both domain

$<$Mej$>=2.8\pm{1.5}$ Msun which further strengthens the evidence that SE-SNe
arise from low mass progenitors which are typically $<5$ Msun at the time of
explosion, again suggesting Mzams $<25$ Msun. The low $<$Mej$>$ and lack of
clear bimodality in the distribution implies $<30$ Msun progenitors and that
envelope stripping via binary interaction is the dominant evolutionary pathway

New Physics (NP) effects in the process $K\to\pi\pi$. In my talk I will review
the Standard Model (SM) prediction for $\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$, with a

diffuse radiative transfer. We investigate the spatial resolution required to
obtain a converged H$_2$ and CO mass fraction and formation history. From the
numerical tests we find that H$_2$ converges at a spatial resolution of
$\lesssim0.2$~pc, while the required resolution for CO convergence is $\lesssim
0.04$~pc in gas with solar metallicity which is subject to a solar
neighbourhood interstellar radiation field. We derive two critical conditions
from our numerical results: the simulation has to at least resolve the
densities at which (1) the molecule formation time in each cell in the
computational domain is equal to the dissociation time, and (2) the formation
time is equal to the the typical cell crossing time. For both H$_2$ and CO, the
second criterion is more restrictive. The formulae we derive can be used to
check whether molecule formation is converged in any given simulation.

rescaling, the collection of paths converges in distribution to the Brownian
web. Hence, we prove convergence to the Brownian web for a particular system of
coalescing random walks in a dynamical random environment. An important tool in
the proof is a tail bound on the meeting time of two walkers on the backbone,
started at the same time. Our result can be interpreted as an averaging
statement about the percolation cluster: apart from a change of variance, it
behaves as the full lattice, i.e. the effect of the ""holes"" in the cluster

streaming flows owing to the baroclinic production of fluctuating vorticity, as
recently demonstrated by Chini et al. (J. Fluid Mech., 744, 2014, pp. 329). In
the present investigation, a set of wave/mean-flow interaction equations is
derived that governs the coupled dynamics of a standing acoustic wave mode of
characteristic (small) amplitude {\epsilon} and the streaming flow it drives in
a thin channel with walls maintained at differing temperatures. Unlike
classical Rayleigh streaming, the resulting mean flow arises at O({\epsilon})
rather than at O({\epsilon^2}). Consequently, fully two-way coupling between
the waves and the mean flow is possible: the streaming is sufficiently strong
to induce O(1) rearrangements of the imposed background temperature and density
fields, which modifies the spatial structure and frequency of the acoustic mode
on the streaming time scale. A novel Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys
analysis is developed to average over the fast wave dynamics, enabling the
coupled system to be integrated strictly on the slow time scale of the
streaming flow. Analytical solutions of the reduced system are derived for weak
wave forcing and are shown to reproduce results from prior direct numerical
simulations (DNS) of the compressible Navier Stokes and heat equations with
remarkable accuracy. Moreover, numerical simulations of the reduced system are
performed in the regime of strong wave mean flow coupling for a fraction of the
computational cost of the corresponding DNS. These simulations shed light on
the potential for baroclinic acoustic streaming to be used as an effective
means to enhance heat transfer.

monitored in the last decade. The favored mechanism at their origin is a
sustained power injection from a magnetar. This study presents non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer simulations of
various single carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet star explosions influenced by magnetars
of diverse properties and covering from a few days to one or two years after
explosion. Nonthermal processes are treated; the magnetar-power deposition
profile is prescribed; dynamical effects are ignored. In this context, the main
influence of the magnetar power is to boost the internal energy of the ejecta
on week-long time scales, enhancing the ejecta temperature and ionization,
shifting the spectral energy distribution to the near-UV (even for the adopted
solar metallicity), creating blue optical colors. Varying the ejecta and
magnetar properties introduces various stretches and shifts to the light curve
(rise time, peak or nebular luminosity, light curve width). At maximum, all
models show the presence of OII and CII lines in the optical, and more rarely
OIII and CIII lines. Non-thermal effects are found to be negligible during the
high-brightness phase. After maximum, higher energy explosions are hotter and
more ionized, and produce spectra that are optically bluer. Clumping is a
source of spectral diversity after maximum. Clumping is essential to trigger
ejecta recombination and yield the presence of OI, CaII, and FeII lines from a
few weeks after maximum until nebular times. The UV and optical spectrum of
Gaia16apd at maximum or the nebular spectrum of LSQ14an at +410d are compatible
with some models that assume no clumping. However, most observed SLSNe Ic seem
to require clumping from early post-maximum to nebular times (e.g., SN2007bi at
+46 and +367d; Gaia16apd at +43d).

lines with many-line inversions. We investigate the feasibility of
spectropolarimetry in the short-wavelength range, 3000 \AA{} - 4300 \AA{},
where the line density but also the photon noise are considerably higher than
in the red, so that many-line inversions could be particularly attractive in
that wavelength range. This is also timely because this wavelength range will
be the focus of a new spectropolarimeter in the third science flight of the
balloon-borne solar observatory SUNRISE. For an ensemble of MHD atmospheres we
synthesize exemplarily spectral regions around 3140 \AA{}, 4080 \AA{}, and 6302
\AA{}. The spectral coverage is chosen such that at a spectral resolving power
of 150000 the spectra can be recorded by a 2K detector. The synthetic Stokes
profiles are degraded with a typical photon noise and afterwards inverted. The
atmospheric parameters of the inversion of noisy profiles are compared with the
inversion of noise-free spectra. We find that significantly more information
can be obtained from many-line inversions than from a traditionally used
inversion of only a few spectral lines. We further find that information on the
upper photosphere can be significantly more reliably obtained at short
wavelengths. In the mid and lower photosphere, the many-line approach at 4080
\AA{} provides equally good results as the many-line approach at 6302 \AA{} for
the magnetic field strength and the LOS velocity, while the temperature
determination is even more precise by a factor of three. We conclude that
many-line spectropolarimetry should be the preferred option in the future.

Gromov-Hausdorff metric to metric spaces equipped with some additional
structure. A special case is the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov metric between
measured metric spaces. This abstract framework unifies several existing
Gromov-Hausdorff-type metrics for metric spaces equipped with a measure, a
point, a closed subset, a curve, a tuple of such structures, etc. Along with
reviewing these special cases in the literature, several new examples are also
presented. Two frameworks are provided, one for compact metric spaces and the
other for boundedly-compact pointed metric spaces. In both cases, a
Gromov-Hausdorff-type metric is defined and its topological properties are
studied. In particular, completeness and separability is proved under some
conditions. This enables one to study random metric spaces equipped with
additional structures, which is the main motivation of this work.

frequency (tune) with intensity of four transverse resonances in a high
intensity Gaussian beam. Due to the non-linear space charge forces present in
high intensity beams, particle motion cannot be analytically described. Instead
we use the Simulator of Particle Orbit Dynamics (S-POD) and the Intense Beam
Experiment (IBEX), two linear Paul traps, to experimentally replicate the
system. In high intensity beams a coherent resonant response to both space
charge and external field driven perturbations is possible, these coherent
resonances are excited at a tune that differs by a factor $C_{m}$ from that of
the incoherent resonance. By increasing the number of ions stored in the linear
Paul trap and studying the location of four different resonances we extract
provisional values describing the change in tune of the resonance with
intensity. These values are then compared to the $C_{m}$ factors for coherent
resonances. We find that the $C_{m}$ factors do not accurately predict the
location of resonances in high intensity Gaussian beams. Further insight into
the experiment is gained through simulation using Warp, a particle-in-cell
code.

effective for solving separable convex optimization subject to linear

which updates the Lagrange multiplier twice with suitable stepsizes, to solve
the multi-block separable convex programming. This GS-ADMM partitions the data
into two group variables so that one group consists of $p$ block variables
while the other has $q$ block variables, where $p \ge 1$ and $q \ge 1$ are two
integers. The two grouped variables are updated in a {\it Gauss-Seidel} scheme,
while the variables within each group are updated in a {\it Jacobi} scheme,
which would make it very attractive for a big data setting. By adding proper
proximal terms to the subproblems, we specify the domain of the stepsizes to
guarantee that GS-ADMM is globally convergent with a worst-case $O(1/t)$
ergodic convergence rate. It turns out that our convergence domain of the
stepsizes is significantly larger than other convergence domains in the
literature. Hence, the GS-ADMM is more flexible and attractive on choosing and
using larger stepsizes of the dual variable. Besides, two special cases of
GS-ADMM, which allows using zero penalty terms, are also discussed and
analyzed. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, preliminary numerical
experiments on solving a sparse matrix minimization problem in the statistical

that exhibit multibubble dynamics. This necessitates a complete understanding
of the mutual nonlinear coupling between individual bubbles. In this study,
strong nonlinear coupling is investigated in bubble pairs which is the simplest
case of a bubble-cluster. This leads to the derivation of a more comprehensive
set of coupled Keller-Miksis equations (KMEs) that contain nonlinear coupling
terms of higher order. The governing KMEs take into account the convective
contribution that stems from the Navier-Stokes equation. The system of KMEs is
numerically solved for acoustically excited bubble pairs. It is shown that the
higher order corrections are important in the estimation of secondary Bjerknes
force for closely spaced bubbles. Further, asymmetricity is witnessed in both
magnitude and sign reversal of the secondary Bjerknes force in weak, regular,

antenna of the data center is equipped with one-bit analog-to-digital converts

challenging to develop a low-complexity detector due to the non-linearity of an
end-to-end channel transfer function (created by relays' operations and one-bit
ADCs). Furthermore, there is no efficient way to estimate such complex function
with a limited number of training data. Motivated by this, we propose a
supervised-learning (SL) detector by introducing a novel Bernoulli-like model
in which training data is directly used to design a detector rather than
estimating a channel transfer function. It is shown that the proposed SL
detector outperforms the existing SL detectors based on Gaussian model for
one-bit quantized (binary observation) systems. Furthermore, we significantly
reduce the complexity of the proposed SL detector using the fast kNN algorithm.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SL detector can yield an
attractive performance with a significantly lower complexity.

of neutrino mass in the context of the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model. The
essence of the program is to exploit lepton number violating decays of doubly
charged scalars, particles which lie at the heart of the Higgs-mechanism-based
seesaw, to probe the Dirac neutrino mass term which in turn enters directly
into a number of physical processes including the decays of right-handed
neutrinos into the $W$ boson and left-handed charged leptons. In this longer
version we discuss at length these and related processes, and offer some
missing technical details. We also carefully analyze the physically appealing
possibility of parity conserving Yukawa sector showing that the neutrino Dirac
mass matrix can be analytically expressed as a function of light and heavy
neutrino masses and mixing, without resorting to any additional discrete
symmetries, a context in which the seesaw mechanism can be disentangled
completely.When parity does get broken, we show that, in the general case, only
the Hermitian part of the Dirac mass term is independent which substantially
simplifies the task of testing experimentally the origin of neutrino mass. We
illustrate this program through some physical examples that allow simple
analytical expressions. Our work shows that the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric
Model is a self-contained theory of neutrino mass which can be in principle
tested at the LHC or the next hadron collider.

  The problem of localization often arises as part of a navigation process. We

contribution of this paper is to formulate such a set of requirements for the
two sub-tasks involved: map construction and self-localization. These
requirements are then exploited for compact map representation and accurate
self-localization, using the framework of a network flow problem. During this
process, we formulate the map construction and self-localization problems as

approach is common in the analysis of large-scale neural systems probed by
non-invasive neuroimaging, few studies have used network science to study the
organization of networks reconstructed at the cellular level, and thus many
very basic and fundamental questions remain unanswered. Here, we used
two-photon calcium imaging to record spontaneous activity from the same set of
cells in mouse auditory cortex over the course of several weeks. We reconstruct
functional networks in which cells are linked to one another by edges weighted
according to the correlation of their fluorescence traces. We show that the
networks exhibit modular structure across multiple topological scales and that
these multi-scale modules unfold as part of a hierarchy. We also show that, on
average, network architecture becomes increasingly dissimilar over time, with
similarity decaying monotonically with the distance (in time) between sessions.
Finally, we show that a small fraction of cells maintain strongly-correlated
activity over multiple days, forming a stable temporal core surrounded by a
fluctuating and variable periphery. Our work provides a careful methodological
blueprint for future studies of spontaneous activity measured by two-photon
calcium imaging using cutting-edge computational methods and machine learning
algorithms informed by explicit graphical models from network science. The

random noise on a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 2$. Here $\ep$ is a
small positive parameter that represents formally the thickness of the solution
interface, while the mild noise $\xi^\ep(t)$ is a smooth random function of $t$
of order $\mathcal O(\ep^{-\gamma})$ with $0<\gamma<1/3$ that converges to
white noise as $\ep\rightarrow 0^+$. We consider initial data that are
independent of $\ep$ satisfying some non-degeneracy conditions, and prove that
steep transition layers---or interfaces---develop within a very short time of
order $\ep^2|\ln\ep|$, which we call the ""generation of interface"". Next we
study the motion of those transition layers and derive a stochastic motion law
for the sharp interface limit as $\ep\rightarrow 0^+$. Furthermore, we prove
that the thickness of the interface for $\ep$ small is indeed of order
$\mathcal O(\ep)$ and that the solution profile near the interface remains
close to that of a (squeezed) travelling wave, this means that the presence of
the noise does not destroy the solution profile near the interface as long as
the noise is spatially uniform. Our results on the motion of interface improve
the earlier results of Funaki (1999) and Weber (2010) by considerably weakening
the requirements for the initial data and establishing the robustness of the
solution profile near the interface that has not been known before.

implicitly represent the 3D surface as the continuous decision boundary of a
deep neural network classifier. In contrast to existing approaches, our
representation encodes a description of the 3D output at infinite resolution

efficiently encode 3D structure and can be inferred from various kinds of

minimally coupled to gravity as matter source. The field equations are studied
in two ways. The method of group invariant transformations, i.e., symmetries of
differential equations apply in order to constraint the free functions of the
theory and determine conservation laws for the gravitational field equations.
The second method that we apply for the study of the evolution of the field
equations is the stability analysis of equilibrium points. Particularly, we
find solutions with $w_{\text{tot}}=-1$, and we study their stability by means
of the Center Manifold Theorem. We show this solution is an attractor in the
dilatonic frame but it is an intermediate accelerated solution $a \simeq e^{A
t^p}, p:=\frac{2}{2+l}, \quad \frac{32}{57+6 \omega_0}<p<\frac{2}{3},

solution with $w_{\text{tot}}=-1$ or a quintessence solution. Other equilibrium
points mimic a standard dark matter source ($0<w_{\text{tot}}<1$), radiation
($w_{\text{tot}}=\frac{1}{3}$), among other interesting features. For the
dynamical system analysis we develop an extension of the method of
$F$-devisers. The new approach relies upon two arbitrary functions $h(\lambda,
s)$ and $F(s)$. The main advantage of this procedure allows us to perform a
phase-space analysis of the cosmological model without the need for specifying
the potentials, revealing the full capabilities of the model.

tractable too. We show how to use the techniques presented in this article also

functional dependencies and key constraints) or when the UCQs contain

three-bundle domain, which is a generalization of the domain-wall ice model on
the square (or, equivalently, of a uniformly random alternating sign matrix).
We show that this model exhibits the arctic boundary phenomenon, whose boundary
is given by a union of explicit algebraic curves. This was originally predicted
by Colomo-Sportiello in 2016 as one of the initial applications of a general
heuristic that they introduced for locating arctic boundaries, called the
(geometric) tangent method. Our proof uses a probabilistic analysis of
non-crossing directed path ensembles to provide a mathematical justification of
their tangent method heuristic in this case, which might be of independent
interest.

supervised dense event captioning, which does not require temporal segment

correspondence assumption, each caption describes one temporal segment, and
each temporal segment has one caption, which holds in current benchmark

demonstrate the ability of our model on both dense event captioning and

graphene. The multiband nature of the bilayers is important because of the very
small band gaps between conduction and valence bands. The long range nature of
the superfluid pairing interaction means that screening must be fully taken
into account. We have carried out a systematic mean-field investigation that
includes (i) contributions to screening from both intraband and interband
excitations, (ii) the low-energy band structure of bilayer graphene with its
small band gap and flattened Mexican hat-like low-energy bands, (iii) the large
density of states at the bottom of the bands, (iv) electron-hole pairing in the
multibands, and (v) electron-hole pair transfers between the conduction and
valence band condensates. We find that the superfluidity strongly modifies the
intraband contributions to the screening, but that the interband contributions
are unaffected. Unexpectedly, the net effect of the screening is to suppress
Josephson-like pair transfers and to confine the superfluid pairing entirely to
the conduction band condensate even for very small band gaps, making the system
behave similarly to a one-band superfluid.

conditions. As there are currently more and more reports of perovskite solar
cells without J-V hysteresis it is crucial to distinguish between genuine
performance improvements and measurement artifacts. We focus on two of the
parameters that influence the dynamic J-V scans, namely the bias scan rate and
and the bias poling voltage, and point out measurement conditions for achieving
a hysteresis-free behavior. In this context we discuss the suitability of
defining a hysteresis index (HI) for the characterization of dynamic J-V scans.
Using HI, aging effects are also investigated, establishing a potential
connection between the sample degradation and the variation of the maximal
hysteresis on one hand, and relaxation time scale of the slow process, on the
other hand. Pre-poling induced recombinations effects are identified. In
addition, our analysis based on sample pre-biasing reveals potential indication
regarding two types of slow processes, with two different relaxation time
scales, which provides further insight regarding ionic migration.

users, however pose challenges to cater to the high-speed users. The major
difficulty being that of frequent handovers and the corresponding handover
losses, which significantly depend upon the speed of the user. It was shown
previously that the optimal cell size increases with speed. Thus, in scenarios
with diverse users (speeds spanning over large ranges), it would be inefficient
to serve all users using common cell radius and it is practically infeasible to
design different cell sizes for different speeds. Alternatively, we propose to
allocate power to a user based on its speed, e.g., higher power virtually
increases the cell size. We solve well known Hamiltonian Jacobi equations under
certain assumptions to obtain a power law, optimal for load factor and busy
probability, for any given average power constraint and cell size. The optimal
power control turns out to be linear in speed. We build a system level
simulator for small cell network, using elaborate Monte-Carlo simulations, and
show that the performance of the system improves significantly with linear
power law. The power law is tested even for the cases, for which the system
does not satisfy the assumptions required by the theory. For example, the
linear power law has significant improvement in comparison with the 'equal
power' system, even in presence of time varying and random interference. We
observe good improvement in almost all cases with improvements up to 89\% for
certain configurations.

candidate for practical implementations due to their low power consumption and
zero-bias detection functionality. Here, we demonstrate the generation of
self-starting ICL frequency combs. We show that the gain is fast enough to
respond to beating of the intracavity field, which hinders the formation of
short pulses. Instead, the ICL operates in a comb state, where the phases of
the fundamental intermode beatings are splayed over a range of $2\pi$. This
state appears to be general to self-starting combs based on the inherent gain
nonlinearity and minimizes oscillations of the population inversion. Using the

square lattice. The Hamiltonian consist of effective hoppings of the electrons
between the lattice sites and the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Approximating the
irreducible charge correlation function by a single bubble yields the ladder
approximation for the charge correlation function. In this approximation one
finds in general three charge instabilities, two of them are due to nesting,
the third one is the flux phase instability. Since these instabilities cannot
explain the experiments in hole-doped cuprates we have included in the
irreducible charge correlation function also Aslamasov-Larkin (AL) diagrams
where charge fluctuations interact with products of spin fluctuations. We then
find at high temperatures a nematic or $d$-wave Pomeranchuk instability with a
very small momentum. Its transition temperature decreases roughly linearly with
doping in the underdoped region and vanishes near optimal doping. Decreasing
the temperature further a secondary axial charge-density wave (CDW) instability
appears with mainly $d$-wave symmetry and a wave vector somewhat larger than
the distance between nearest neighbor hot spots. At still lower temperatures
the diagonal flux phase instability emerges. A closer look shows that the AL
diagrams enhance mainly axial and not diagonal charge fluctuations in our
one-band model. This is the main reason why axial and not diagonal
instabilities are the leading ones in agreement with experiment. The two
instabilities due to nesting vanish already at very low temperatures and do not
play any major role in the phase diagram. Remarkable is that the nematic and
the axial CDW instabilities show a large reentrant behavior.

external occulter will be placed on the first satellite approximately 150 m
ahead of the second satellite that will carry an optical instrument. During 6
hours per orbit, the satellites will fly in a precise formation, constituting a
giant externally occulted coronagraph. Large distance between the external
occulter and the primary objective will allow observations of the white-light
solar corona starting from extremely low heights 1.1RSun. Aims: To analyze
influence of optical ghost images formed inside the telescope and develop an
algorithm for their removal. Methods: We implement the optical layout of
ASPIICS in Zemax and study the ghost behaviour in sequential and non-sequential
regimes. We identify sources of the ghost contributions and analyze their
geometrical behaviour. Finally we develop a mathematical model and software to
calculate ghost images for any given input image. Results: We show that ghost
light can be important in the outer part of the field of view, where the
coronal signal is weak, since the energy of bright inner corona is
redistributed to the outer corona. However the model allows to remove the ghost
contribution. Due to a large distance between the external occulter and the
primary objective, the primary objective does not produce a significant ghost.
The use of the Lyot spot in ASPIICS is not necessary.

discussion of quantum mechanics (QM) that in some way incorporates the notion
of a minimum length. This upsurge of research has been prompted by the modified
uncertainty relation brought about in the framework of string theory. In
general, the implementation of minimum length in QM can be done either by
modification of position and momentum operators or by restriction of their
domains. In the former case we have the so called soccer-ball problem when the
naive classical limit appears to be drastically different from the usual one.
Starting with the latter possibility, an alternative approach was suggested in
the form of a band-limited QM. However, applying momentum cutoff to the
wave-function, one faces the problem of incompatibility with the
Schr\""{o}dinger equation. One can overcome this problem in a natural fashion by
appropriately modifying Schr\""{o}dinger equation. But incompatibility takes
place for boundary conditions as well. Such wave-function cannot have any more
a finite support in the coordinate space as it simply follows from the
Paley-Wiener theorem. Treating, for instance, the simplest quantum-mechanical
problem of a particle in an infinite potential well, one can no longer impose
box boundary conditions. In such cases, further modification of the theory is
in order. We propose a non-local modification of QM, which has close ties to
the band-limited QM, but does not require a hard momentum cutoff. In the
framework of this model, one can easily work out the corrections to various
processes and discuss further the semi-classical limit of the theory.

  It is erroneous to pretend to extract physical information from the
experimental light curves (time series) of astrophysical systems by means of
linear stochastic differential equations (LSDE). In general, the time evolution
of these systems is governed by a set of nonlinear differential equations.
Hence, the LSDEs are not suitable to model their dynamics. In spite of this,
recently the LSDEs have been proposed as tools for the analysis of AGN light
curves. Their use in this context seems to be dictated by their simplicity
rather than by a real physical argument. We stress in this note that the
correct approach to the analysis of signals coming from systems with nonlinear
dynamics is to tackle the problem using methodologies in well defined physical
contexts.

  arXiv:1811.12064",,,,"cs.LG q-fin.CP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, state-of-the-art methods for supervised learning have
exploited increasingly gradient boosting techniques, with mainstream efficient
implementations such as xgboost or lightgbm. One of the key points in
generating proficient methods is Feature Selection (FS). It consists in
selecting the right valuable effective features. When facing hundreds of these
features, it becomes critical to select best features. While filter and
wrappers methods have come to some maturity, embedded methods are truly
necessary to find the best features set as they are hybrid methods combining
features filtering and wrapping. In this work, we tackle the problem of finding
through machine learning best a priori trades from an algorithmic strategy. We
derive this new method using coordinate ascent optimization and using block
variables. We compare our method to Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and
Binary Coordinate Ascent (BCA). We show on a real life example the capacity of
this method to select good trades a priori. Not only this method outperforms
the initial trading strategy as it avoids taking loosing trades, it also
surpasses other method, having the smallest feature set and the highest score
at the same time. The interest of this method goes beyond this simple trade
classification problem as it is a very general method to determine the optimal
feature set using some information about features relationship as well as using
coordinate ascent optimization.

neutrino oscillation and cross-section measurements in surface detectors. We
present methods for CR rejection in measurements of charged-current

in the final state, measured using liquid argon time projection chambers
(LArTPCs). Using a sample of cosmic data collected with the MicroBooNE
detector, mixed with simulated neutrino scattering events, a set of event
selection criteria is developed that produces an event sample with minimal
contribution from CR background. Depending on the selection criteria used a
purity between 50% and 80% can be achieved with a signal selection efficiency
between 50% and 25%, with higher purity coming at the expense of lower
efficiency. While using a specific dataset from the MicroBooNE detector and

fusion of spatial-temporal multi-sensor data pertaining to understanding
patterns of humans physiological changes in an urban environment. The framework
includes signal frequency unification, signal pairing, signal filtering, signal
quantification, and data labeling. Furthermore, this paper contributes to
human-environment interaction research, where a field study to understand the
influence of environmental features such as varying sound level, illuminance,
field-of-view, or environmental conditions on humans' perception was proposed.
In the study, participants of various demographic backgrounds walked through an
urban environment in Zurich, Switzerland while wearing physiological and
environmental sensors. Apart from signal processing, four machine learning
techniques, classification, fuzzy rule-based inference, feature selection, and
clustering, were applied to discover relevant patterns and relationship between
the participants' physiological responses and environmental conditions. The
predictive models with high accuracies indicate that the change in the
field-of-view corresponds to increased participant arousal. Among all features,
the participants' physiological responses were primarily affected by the change
in environmental conditions and field-of-view.

autoencoder on the IRON-OFF handwriting data-set. We perform three experiments
that systematically explore the quality of our style extraction procedure.
First, We compare our model to handwriting benchmarks using multidimensional
performance metrics. Second, we explore the quality of style transfer, i.e. how
the model performs on new, unseen writers. In both experiments, we improve the
metrics of state of the art methods by a large margin. Lastly, we analyze the
latent space of our model, and we see that it separates consistently writing
styles.

This study describes using deep learning method for iceberg or ship recognition
with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Drifting icebergs pose a potential
threat to activities offshore around the Arctic, including for both ship
navigation and oil rigs. Advancement of satellite imagery using
weather-independent cross-polarized radar has enabled us to monitor and
delineate icebergs and ships, however a human component is needed to classify
the images. Here we present Transfer Learning, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) designed to work with a limited training data and features, while
demonstrating its effectiveness in this problem. Key aspect of the approach is
data augmentation and stacking of multiple outputs, resulted in a significant
boost in accuracy (logarithmic score of 0.1463). This algorithm has been tested
through participation at the Statoil/C-Core Kaggle competition.

presence of Born-Infeld electromagnetic field. We show that electric-magnetic
duality reported for dyonic solutions with Maxwell field is omitted in case of
Born-Infeld generalization. We also confirm that generalization to nonlinear
field provides the possibility of canceling the effects of cosmological
constant. This is done for nonlinearity parameter with $10^{-33}\mbox{ eV}^{2}$
order of magnitude which is high nonlinearity regime. In addition, we show that
for small electric/magnetic charge and high nonlinearity regime, black holes
would develop critical behavior and several phases. In contrast, for highly
charged case and Maxwell limits (small nonlinearity), black holes have one
thermal stable phase. We also find that the pressure of the cold black holes is
bounded by some constraints on its volume while hot black holes' pressure has
physical behavior for any volume. In addition, we report on possibility of
existences of triple point and reentrant of phase transition in thermodynamics
of these black holes. Finally, We show that if electric and magnetic charges
are identical, the behavior of our solutions would be Maxwell like (independent
of nonlinear parameter and field). In other words, nonlinearity of
electromagnetic field becomes evident only when these black holes are charged
magnetically and electrically different.

used. Although a lot of data is publicly available, it is often dispersed,
tedious to process and partly contains errors. We argue that a central
provision of input data for modelling has the character of a public good: it
reduces overall societal costs for quantitative energy research as redundant
work is avoided, and it improves transparency and reproducibility in
electricity system modelling. This paper describes the Open Power System Data
platform that aims at realising the efficiency and quality gains of centralised
data provision by collecting, checking, processing, aggregating, documenting
and publishing data required by most modellers. We conclude that the platform
can provide substantial benefits to energy system analysis by raising
efficiency of data pre-processing, providing a method for making data
pre-processing for energy system modelling traceable, flexible and reproducible
and improving the quality of original data published by data providers.

Numerous cities around the world are launching blockchain initiatives as part
of the overall efforts toward shaping the urban future. However, the infancy
stage of the blockchain industry leads to a severe gap between the knowledge we
have and the actions urban policy makers are taking. This paper is an effort to
narrow this rift. We provide a systematic literature review on concrete
blockchain use cases proposed by the research community. At the macro-level, we
discuss and organize use cases from 159 selected papers into nine sectors
recognized as crucial for sustainable and smart urban future. At the
micro-level, we identify a component-based framework and analyze the design and
prototypes of blockchain systems studied in a subset of 71 papers. The
high-level use case review allows us to illustrate the relationship between
them and the four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic,
environmental, and governmental. The system level analysis helps us highlight
interesting inconsistencies between well-known blockchain applicability
decision rules and the approaches taken by the literature. We also offer two
classification methodologies for blockchain use cases and elaborate on how they
can be applied to stimulate cross-sector insights in the blockchain knowledge
domain.

high-rise buildings is an inevitable reality. However, they pose mental health
risks for citizens in terms of detachment from natural light, sky view,
greenery, and environmental landscapes. The housing economy and rent structure
in different areas may or may not take account of such environmental factors.
In this paper, we build a computer vision based pipeline to study factors like
sky visibility, greenery in the sidewalks, and dominant colors present in
streets from a pedestrian's perspective. We show that people in lower economy
classes may suffer from lower sky visibility, whereas people in higher economy
classes may suffer from lack of greenery in their environment, both of which
could be possibly addressed by implementing rent restructuring schemes.
