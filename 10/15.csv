levels is of great clinical importance but remains very challenging. Contrary
to traditional classification methods that rely on hand-crafted or engineered
features, convolution neural network (CNN) can classify cervical cells based on
automatically learned deep features. However, CNN in previous studies do not
involve cell morphological information, and it is unknown whether morphological
features can be directly modeled by CNN to classify cervical cells. This paper
presents a CNN-based method that combines cell image appearance with cell
morphology for classification of cervical cells in Pap smear. The training
cervical cell dataset consists of adaptively re-sampled image patches coarsely
centered on the nuclei. Several CNN models (AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet and
DenseNet) pre-trained on ImageNet dataset were fine-tuned on the cervical
dataset for comparison. The proposed method is evaluated on the Herlev cervical
dataset by five-fold cross-validation at patient level splitting. Results show
that by adding cytoplasm and nucleus masks as raw morphological information
into appearance-based CNN learning, higher classification accuracies can be
achieved in general. Among the four CNN models, GoogleNet fed with both
morphological and appearance information obtains the highest classification
accuracies of 94.5% for 2-class classification task and 64.5% for 7-class
classification task. Our method demonstrates that combining cervical cell
morphology with appearance information can provide improved classification
performance, which is clinically important for early diagnosis of cervical

baryonic matter at high density has an emergent ""pseudo-conformal symmetry."" It
is argued that as baryonic density exceeds $n \simeq n_{1/2} \gtrsim 2n_0$, a
topology change mimicking the baryon-quark continuity takes place at $n_{1/2}$.
In terms of skyrmions, this corresponds to the transition from skyrmions to
half-skyrmions and impacts on the equation of state of dense baryonic matter.
The emergence in medium at $n_{1/2}$ of parity-doublet symmetry -- which is
invisible in QCD in matter-free vacuum -- plays the crucial role. The
consequence of the topology change is that massive compact stars carry the
""pseudo-conformal sound velocity"" $v_s^2/c^2\approx 1/3$ at $n\gsim n_{1/2}$
signaling a precursor to precocious emergence of scale symmetry as well as {a}
local symmetry hidden in QCD in the matter-free vacuum. A highly significant
prediction of this work is that the topology change density from normal matter
to half-skyrmion matter, up-to-date inaccessible either by QCD proper or by
terrestrial experiments, could possibly be pinned down within the range $2 <
n_{1/2}/n_0 < 4$, commensurate with the range expected for a continuous

Dissertation Sixth, as a lens to examine physics as a cognitive, practical, and
social, enterprise. Forbes wrote this survey of eighteenth- and
nineteenth-century mathematical and physical sciences, in 1852-6, when British
""physics"" was at a pivotal point in its history, situated between a discipline
identified by its mathematical methods - originating in France - and one
identified by its university laboratory institutions. Contemporary
encyclopaedias provided a nexus for publishers, the book trade, readers, and
men of science, in the formation of physics as a field. Forbes was both a
witness, whose account of the progress of physics or natural philosophy can be
explored at face value, and an agent, who exploited the opportunity offered by
the Encyclopaedia Britannica in the mid nineteenth-century to enrol the broadly
educated public, and scientific collective, illuminating the connection between
the definition of physics and its forms of social practice. Forbes used the
terms ""physics"" and ""natural philosophy"" interchangeably. He portrayed the
field as progressed by the natural genius of great men, who curated the
discipline within an associational culture that engendered true intellectual
spirit. Although this societal mechanism was becoming ineffective, Forbes did
not see university institutions as the way forward. Instead, running counter to
his friend William Whewell, he advocated inclusion of the mechanical arts
(engineering), and a strictly limited role for mathematics. He revealed
tensions when the widely accepted discovery-based historiography conflicted
with intellectual and moral worth, reflecting a nineteenth-century concern with
spirit that cuts across twentieth-century questions about discipline and field.

of inviscid vortex rings discovered by Norbury (1973). Since these vortex rings
are obtained as solutions to a free-boundary problem, their stability analysis
is performed using recently-developed methods of shape differentiation applied
to the contour-dynamics formulation of the problem in the 3D axisymmetric
geometry. This approach allows us to systematically account for the effects of
boundary deformations on the linearized evolution of the vortex ring. We
investigate the instantaneous amplification of perturbations assumed to have
the same the circulation as the vortex rings in their equilibrium
configuration. These stability properties are then determined by the spectrum
of a singular integro-differential operator defined on the vortex boundary in
the meridional plane. The resulting generalized eigenvalue problem is solved
numerically with a spectrally-accurate discretization. Our results reveal that
while thin vortex rings remain neutrally stable to axisymmetric perturbations,
they become linearly unstable to such perturbations when they are sufficiently
``fat''. Analysis of the structure of the eigenmodes demonstrates that they
approach the corresponding eigenmodes of Rankine's vortex and Hill's vortex in
the thin-vortex and fat-vortex limit, respectively. This study is a stepping
stone on the way towards a complete stability analysis of inviscid vortex rings

Additionally, the superpositions of degenerate linear Bloch waves can suppress
the supercurrents and give rise to families of nonlinear standing-wave states

segmentation platform that addresses multiple difficulties in segmenting MR
images such as varying inhomogeneity, non-standardness, and noise, while
producing high-quality definition of different tissues. In contrast to most
approaches in the literature, we perform segmentation operation by combining
three different MRI contrasts and a novel segmentation tool which takes into
account variability in the data. The proposed system, based on a novel affinity
definition within the fuzzy connectivity (FC) image segmentation family,
prevents the need for user intervention and reparametrization of the
segmentation algorithms. In order to make the whole system fully automated, we
adapt an affinity propagation clustering algorithm to roughly identify tissue
regions and image background. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed
algorithm's individual steps as well as comparison with several approaches from
the literature for the main application of muscle/fat separation. Furthermore,
whole-body tissue composition and brain tissue delineation were conducted to
show the generalization ability of the proposed system. This new automated
platform outperforms other state-of-the-art segmentation approaches both in
accuracy and efficiency.

refrigeration system are the cooling power managed through the outlet
temperature of the evaporator and the superheating degree at the condenser. The
input variables of the system are the valve opening and the compressor speed.
System identification is performed by applying stepped signals to the input
variables, resulting in four transfer functions estimated with a Box-Jenkins
model. From the MIMO system transfer functions, the relative gain array is
calculated to determinate the best variables to be paired. After that,
according to the variables to be paired, the corresponding transfer functions
are reduced to order two to design a PID controller for each output variable
employing the internal model control technique. Then, the controllers are
contrasted employing a set of quantitative performance indexes with the control
results achieved in the PID18 workshop. Obtained results show that the proposed
Internal Model controllers have better performance than most of the proposed

  The Extended Haagerup subfactor has two even parts EH1 and EH2. These fusion
categories are mysterious and are the only known fusion categories which appear
to be unrelated to finite groups, quantum groups, or Izumi quadratic
categories. One key technique which has previously revealed hidden structure in
fusion categories is to study all other fusion categories in the Morita
equivalence class, and hope that one of the others is easier to understand. In
this paper we show that there are exactly four categories (EH1, EH2, EH3, EH4)
in the Morita equivalence class of Extended Haagerup, and that there is a
unique Morita equivalence between each pair. The existence of EH3 and EH4 gives
a number of interesting new subfactors. Neither EH3 nor EH4 appears to be
easier to understand than the Extended Haaerup subfactor, providing further
evidence that Extended Haagerup does not come from known constructions. We also
find several interesting intermediate subfactor lattices related to Extended
Haagerup.
  The method we use to construct EH3 and EH4 is interesting in its own right
and gives a general computational recipe for constructing fusion categories in
the Morita equivalence class of a subfactor. We show that pivotal module $\rm
C^*$ categories over a given subfactor correspond exactly to realizations of
that subfactor planar algebra as a planar subalgebra of a graph planar algebra.
This allows us to construct EH3 and EH4 by realizing the Extended Haagerup
subfactor planar algebra inside the graph planar algebras of two new graphs.
This technique also answers a long-standing question of Jones: which graph

  Estimation Made Possible",,,,,"cs.CE cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the problem of estimating origin-destination (OD) flows
from link flows. As the number of link flows is typically much less than that
of OD flows, the inverse problem is severely ill-posed and hence prior
information is required to recover the ground truth. The basic approach in the
literature relies on a forward model where the so called traffic assignment
matrix maps OD flows to link flows. Due to the ill-posedness of the problem,
prior information on the assignment matrix and OD flows are typically needed.
  The main contributions of this paper include a dimension reduction of the
inquired flows from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, and a demonstration that for the first
time the ground truth OD flows can be uniquely identified with no or little
prior information. To cope with the ill-posedness due to the large number of
unknowns, a new forward model is developed which does not involve OD flows
directly but is built upon the flows characterized only by their origins,
henceforth referred as O-flows. The new model preserves all the OD information
and more importantly reduces the dimension of the inverse problem
substantially. A Gauss-Seidel method is deployed to solve the inverse problem,
and a necessary condition for the uniqueness of the solution is proved.
Simulations demonstrate that blind estimation where no prior information is
available is possible for some network settings. Some challenging network
settings are identified and discussed, where a remedy based on temporal
patterns of the O-flows is developed and numerically shown effective.

General Game Playing (GGP) provides a good testbed for reinforcement learning
to research AGI. Q-learning is one of the canonical reinforcement learning
methods, and has been used by (Banerjee $\&$ Stone, IJCAI 2007) in GGP. In this
paper we implement Q-learning in GGP for three small-board games (Tic-Tac-Toe,
Connect Four, Hex)\footnote{source code: https://github.com/wh1992v/ggp-rl}, to
allow comparison to Banerjee et al.. We find that Q-learning converges to a
high win rate in GGP. For the $\epsilon$-greedy strategy, we propose a first
enhancement, the dynamic $\epsilon$ algorithm. In addition, inspired by (Gelly
$\&$ Silver, ICML 2007) we combine online search (Monte Carlo Search) to
enhance offline learning, and propose QM-learning for GGP. Both enhancements
improve the performance of classical Q-learning. In this work, GGP allows us to
show, if augmented by appropriate enhancements, that classical table-based
Q-learning can perform well in small games.

run, usually in a high-level language like JavaScript, and the service provider
orchestrates all the necessary infrastructure and software stacks. The function
provider is only billed for the actual computational resources used by the
function invocation. Compared to previous cloud paradigms, FaaS requires
significantly more fine-grained resource measurement mechanisms, e.g. to
measure compute time and memory usage of a single function invocation with
sub-second accuracy. Thanks to the short duration and stateless nature of
functions, and the availability of multiple open-source frameworks, FaaS
enables non-traditional service providers e.g. individuals or data centers with
spare capacity. However, this exacerbates the challenge of ensuring that
resource consumption is measured accurately and reported reliably. It also
raises the issues of ensuring computation is done correctly and minimizing the
amount of information leaked to service providers.
  To address these challenges, we introduce S-FaaS, the first architecture and
implementation of FaaS to provide strong security and accountability guarantees
backed by Intel SGX. To match the dynamic event-driven nature of FaaS, our
design introduces a new key distribution enclave and a novel transitive
attestation protocol. A core contribution of S-FaaS is our set of resource
measurement mechanisms that securely measure compute time inside an enclave,
and actual memory allocations. We have integrated S-FaaS into the popular
OpenWhisk FaaS framework. We evaluate the security of our architecture, the

over the spread of age, we investigate how disk lifetime is dependent on
stellar mass. The general relation in IC 348 and Orion A is that primordial
disks around intermediate mass stars (2--5$M_{\odot}$) evolve faster than those
around loss mass stars (0.1--1$M_{\odot}$), which is consistent with previous
results. However, considering only low mass stars, we do not find a significant
dependence of disk frequency on stellar mass. These results can help to better
constrain theories on gas giant planet formation timescales. Secondly, in the
Orion A molecular cloud, in the mass range of 0.35--0.7$M_{\odot}$, we provide
the most robust evidence to date for disk evolution within a single cluster
exhibiting modest age spread. By using surface gravity as an age indicator and
employing 4.5 $\mu m$ excess as a primordial disk diagnostic, we observe a
trend of decreasing disk frequency for older stars. The detection of
intra-cluster disk evolution in NGC 1333 and IC 348 is tentative, since the
slight decrease of disk frequency for older stars is a less than 1-$\sigma$

demonstrates the potential role of the p+11B to 3{\alpha} (for brevity, p-B)
reaction in the biological enhancement of proton therapy effectiveness. The
work reports robust experimental data in terms of clonogenic cell survival and
chromosomal aberrations and unambiguously shows the presence of an enhancement
when cells were exposed to a clinical proton beam subject to treatment with
sodium boroncaptate (BSH). Moreover, the greater occurrence of complex-type
chromosomal exchanges points to the effect as due radiation of a LET (Linear
Energy Transfer) greater than that of protons alone, possibly the alpha
particles generated by the reaction. At the same time, we emphasized that
analytical calculations, performed on the basis of the well-known total
production cross section data, are not able to explain the effect in a
macroscopic way, i.e. solely in terms of a trivial increase in the total dose
released in the cells by the alpha-particles. In this paper, thanks to
simulations and analytical calculations, we will discuss the theoretically
expected alpha particle yield and the corresponding LET and RBE (Relative
Biological Effectiveness) increase related to the 11B presence. We conclude
that a mere calculation based on the classical concepts of integral Dose, and
average LET and RBE cannot be used to justify the observed radiobiological
phenomena. We, therefore, suggest that micro- and nano-dosimetric aspects must
be taken into account.

rotation (2.2 days) remains consistent with existing observations). Our results
do not suffer from the shortcomings of 1-D models as cross correlation

the possible DM candidates proposed in extensions of the Standard Model. There
are however models where these constraints are avoided. One of the simplest and
most striking examples comes from a straightforward Higgs portal pseudoscalar
DM model featured with a softly broken $U(1)$ symmetry. In this model the
tree-level DM-nucleon scattering cross section vanishes in the limit of zero
momentum-transfer. It has also been argued that the leading-order DM-nucleon
cross-section appears at the one-loop level. %, which is too small to be
constrained experimentally. In this work we have calculated the exact
cross-section in the zero momentum-transfer at the leading-order i.e., at the
one-loop level of perturbative expansion. We have concluded that, in agreement
with expectations, the amplitude for the scattering process is UV finite and
approaches zero in the limit of vanishing DM masses. Moreover, we made clear
that the finite DM velocity correction at tree-level is subdominant with
respect to the one-loop contribution. Based on the analytic formulae, our
numerical studies show that, for a typical choice of model parameters, the DM
nuclear recoiling cross section is well below ${\cal O}(10^{-50}~{\rm cm}^2)$,
which indicates that the DM direct detection signal in this model naturally
avoids the present strong experimental limits on the cross-section.

particle in the small-size/long-wavelength limit, up to third lowest order with
respect to the size parameter, X, which we will define rigorously for a
non-spherical particle. T is calculated from the standard extended boundary
condition method with a linear system involving two infinite matrices P and Q,
whose matrix elements are integrals on the particle surface. We show that the
limiting form of the P- and Q-matrices, which is different in the special case
of spheroid, ensures that this Taylor expansion can be obtained by considering
only multipoles of order 3 or less (i.e. dipoles, quadrupoles, and octupoles).
This allows us to obtain self-contained expressions for the Taylor expansion of
T(X). The lowest order is O(X^3) and equivalent to the quasi-static limit or
Rayleigh approximation. Expressions to order O(X^5) are obtained by Taylor
expansion of the integrals in P and Q followed by matrix inversion. We then
apply a radiative correction scheme, which makes the resulting expressions
valid up to order O(X^6). Orientation-averaged extinction, scattering, and
absorption cross-sections are then derived. All results are compared to the
exact T-matrix predictions to confirm the validity of our expressions and
assess their range of applicability. For a wavelength of 400nm, the new
approximation remains valid (within 1% error) up to particle dimensions of the
order of 100-200nm depending on the exact parameters (aspect ratio and
material). These results provide a relatively simple and
computationally-friendly alternative to the standard T-matrix method for

learning solutions to LHC particle track reconstruction problems. A variety of
models were studied that drew inspiration from computer vision applications and
operated on an image-like representation of tracking detector data. While these
approaches have shown some promise, image-based methods face challenges in
scaling up to realistic HL-LHC data due to high dimensionality and sparsity. In
contrast, models that can operate on the spacepoint representation of track

efficiently. In this paper we will show two sets of new deep learning models
for reconstructing tracks using space-point data arranged as sequences or
connected graphs. In the first set of models, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
are used to extrapolate, build, and evaluate track candidates akin to Kalman
Filter algorithms. Such models can express their own uncertainty when trained
with an appropriate likelihood loss function. The second set of models use
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the tasks of hit classification and segment
classification. These models read a graph of connected hits and compute
features on the nodes and edges. They adaptively learn which hit connections
are important and which are spurious. The models are scaleable with simple
architecture and relatively few parameters. Results for all models will be
presented on ACTS generic detector simulated data.

late-type T dwarfs (T6-T9), twelve of which have unusually red or blue J-H

high-gravity, low-metallicity (old) and low-gravity, solar-metallicity (young)
extremes of the late-type T dwarf population. We use medium-resolution Y- and
H-band spectroscopy to probe regions of T dwarf atmospheres that are more
sensitive to gravity and metallicity variations than the J band. We find that
the spectral morphologies of our sample are largely homogeneous, with
peak-normalized, Y- and H-band morphologies consistent with spectral standards.
However, three objects stand out as potentially old, with overluminous Y-band
spectra compared to their respective spectral standards, and a fourth object
stands out as potentially young, with an underluminous Y band. Of these four
objects, three have been previously identified as potential metallicity/gravity
outliers, including the one object in our sample with a normal J-H color. We
fit publicly available atmospheric model grids to our spectra and find that the
best-fit physical parameters vary depending on the model used. As we continue
to probe the characteristics of the late-T population, differences in synthetic
spectra of ~10-20% in the blue wing of the Y band and ~45% at 1.65 microns, for
the same physical parameters, must be reconciled. Further development and
public availability of nonsolar metallicity models is also recommended. Future
progress toward deciphering the impacts of gravity, metallicity, and

a small bilinear condensate breaking $SO(4)$ symmetry is present. The
generalization described in this paper simply consists of the addition of a

treat the two tasks independently. One typical assumption of the existing depth

while object moving could be easily modeled using optical flow. In this paper,
we propose to address the two tasks as a whole, i.e. to jointly understand
per-pixel 3D geometry and motion. This eliminates the need of static scene
assumption and enforces the inherent geometrical consistency during the
learning process, yielding significantly improved results for both tasks. We
call our method as ""Every Pixel Counts++"" or ""EPC++"". Specifically, during
training, given two consecutive frames from a video, we adopt three parallel
networks to predict the camera motion (MotionNet), dense depth map (DepthNet),
and per-pixel optical flow between two frames (OptFlowNet) respectively. The
three types of information are fed into a holistic 3D motion parser (HMP), and
per-pixel 3D motion of both rigid background and moving objects are
disentangled and recovered. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on
datasets with different scenes, including driving scenario (KITTI 2012 and

techniques requires extension of the time spent by the molecule in the pore. We
develop an electrostatic theory of polymer translocation to show that the
translocation time can be extended via the dielectric trapping of the polymer.
In dilute salt conditions, the dielectric contrast between the low permittivity
membrane and large permittivity solvent gives rise to attractive interactions
between the cis and trans portions of the polymer. This self-attraction acts as
a dielectric trap that can enhance the translocation time by orders of
magnitude. We also find that electrostatic interactions result in the piecewise
scaling of the translocation time $\tau$ with the polymer length $L$. In the
short polymer regime $L\lesssim10$ nm where the external drift force dominates
electrostatic polymer interactions, the translocation is characterized by the
drift behavior $\tau\sim L^2$. In the intermediate length regime $10\;{\rm
nm}\lesssim L\lesssim\kappa_{\rm b}^{-1}$ where $\kappa_{\rm b}$ is the
Debye-H\""{u}ckel screening parameter, the dielectric trap takes over the drift
force. As a result, increasing polymer length leads to quasi-exponential growth
of the translocation time. Finally, in the regime of long polymers
$L\gtrsim\kappa_{\rm b}^{-1}$ where salt screening leads to the saturation of
the dielectric trap, the translocation time grows linearly as $\tau\sim L$.
This strong departure from the drift behavior highlights the essential role
played by electrostatic interactions in polymer translocation.

95, 024611]. There are different levels of sophistication in theories for
one-nucleon transfer reactions, including the adiabatic wave approximation
(ADWA) which takes deuteron breakup into account to all orders. In this work,
we quantify the uncertainties associated with the ADWA method that come from
the parameterization of the NA interactions, and compare ADWA with DWBA. We use
nucleon elastic-scattering data on a wide variety of targets to constrain the
optical potential input to the ADWA theory. Pulling from the
$\chi^2$-distribution, we obtain 95% confidence plots for the elastic
distributions. From the resulting parameters, we predict 95% confidence bands
for the (d,p) transfer cross sections. Results obtained with the uncorrelated
$\chi^2$ are compared to those using the correlated $\chi^2$ of Lovell et al.
We also repeat the DWBA calculations for the same reactions for comparison
purposes. We find that NA elastic scattering data provides a significant
constraint to the interactions, and, when the uncertainties are propagated to
the transfer reactions using ADWA, predictions are consistent with the transfer
data. The angular distributions for ADWA differ from those predicted by DWBA,
particularly at small angles. Confidence bands obtained using the uncorrelated
$\chi^2$-function are unrealistically narrow and become much wider when the
correlated $\chi^2$-function is considered. For most cases, the uncertainty
bands obtained in ADWA are narrower than DWBA, when using elastic data of
similar quality and range. However, given the large uncertainties predicted
from the correlated $\chi^2$-function, the transfer data cannot discriminate
between these two methods.

the sunspot. We analyzed 3D radiative MHD simulations of solar
magnetoconvection with a self-organized pore-like magnetic structure, and
identified more than 600 individual acoustic events both inside and outside of

the magnetic structure, acoustic sources are associated with downdrafts. Their
depth correlates with downdraft speed and magnetic fields. The sources often
can be transported into deeper layers by downdrafts. The wave front shape, in
the case of a strong or inclined downdraft, can be stretched along the
downdraft. Inside the magnetic structure, excitation of acoustic waves is
driven by converging flows. Frequently, strong converging plasma streams hit
the structure boundaries, causing compressions in its interior that excite
acoustic waves. Analysis of the depth distribution of acoustic events shows the
strongest concentration at 0.2 - 1 Mm beneath the surface for the outside
sources and 2.5 - 3 Mm for the excitation event inside the structure.

Here, we propose and numerically demonstrate that a hollow silicon nanodisk can
serve as a versatile antenna for directing and enhancing the emission from
either an electric or magnetic dipole emitter. When primarily coupled to both
electric and magnetic dipole modes of a nanoantenna, broadband
nearly-unidirectional emission can be realized by the interference of two
modes, which can be spectrally tuned via the geometric parameters in an easy
way. More importantly, the emission directions for the magnetic and electric
dipole emitters are shown as opposite to each other through control of the
phase difference between the induced magnetic and electric dipole modes of the
antenna. Meanwhile, the Purcell factors can be enhanced by more than one order
of magnitude and high quantum efficiencies can be maintained at the visible
spectrum for both kinds of dipole emitters. We further show that these
unidirectional emission phenomena can withstand small disorder effects of
in-plane dipole orientation and location. Our study provides a simple yet

accurate channel estimation, the key challenge is how to design an efficient
beam searching scheme to leave more time for data transmission. Motivated by
the successful applications of machine learning, this paper tries to exploit
the similarities between current and historical wireless propagation
environments. Using the knowledge of reinforcement learning, the beam searching
problem of mmWave HST communications is formulated as a multi-armed bandit
(MAB) problem and a bandit inspired beam searching scheme is proposed to reduce
the number of measurements as many as possible. Unlike the popular deep
learning methods, the proposed scheme does not need to collect and store a
massive amount of training data in advance, which can save a huge amount of
resources such as storage space, computing time, and power energy. Moreover,
the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of regret. The
regret analysis indicates that the proposed schemes can approach the
theoretical limit very quickly, which is further verified by simulation
results.

  Exploiting the Age-of-Information",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of collaboratively estimating the state of a
discrete-time LTI process by a network of sensor nodes interacting over a
time-varying directed communication graph. Existing approaches to this problem
either (i) make restrictive assumptions on the dynamical model, or (ii) make
restrictive assumptions on the sequence of communication graphs, or (iii)
require multiple consensus iterations between consecutive time-steps of the
dynamics, or (iv) require higher-dimensional observers. In this paper, we
develop a distributed observer that operates on a single time-scale, is of the
same dimension as that of the state, and works under mild assumptions of joint
observability of the sensing model, and joint strong-connectivity of the
sequence of communication graphs. Our approach is based on the notion of a
novel ""freshness-index"" that keeps track of the age-of-information being
diffused across the network. In particular, such indices enable nodes to reject
stale information regarding the state of the system, and in turn, help achieve
stability of the estimation error dynamics. Based on the proposed approach, the
estimate of each node can be made to converge to the true state exponentially
fast, at any desired convergence rate. In fact, we argue that finite-time
convergence can also be achieved through a suitable selection of the observer
gains. Our proof of convergence is self-contained, and employs simple arguments
from linear system theory and graph theory.

({\it i}) a precise determination of the transition density using rheological
measurements and ({\it ii}) a matching rule that selects the critical exponents

determine exponents with unprecedented accuracy and resolve the long-standing

black holes and neutron stars, and propagate as ripples in the very fabric of
spacetime. As the waves carry off orbital energy, the two bodies spiral into
each other and eventually merge. They are described by Einstein's equations of
General Relativity. For the early phase of the orbit, called the inspiral,
Einstein equations can be linearized and solved through analytical
approximations, while for the late phase, near the merger, we need to solve the
fully nonlinear Einstein's equations on supercomputers. In order to recover the
gravitational wave for the entire evolution of the binary, a match is required
between the inspiral and the merger waveforms. Our objectives are to establish
a streamlined matching method, that will allow an analytical calculation of the
complete gravitational waveform, while developing a gravitational wave modeling
tutorial for undergraduate physics students. We use post-Newtonian (PN) theory
for the inspiral phase, which offers an excellent training ground for students,
and rely on Mathematica for our calculations, a tool easily accessible to

simple analytic toy model named the Implicit Rotating Source (IRS). After
building the inspiral and merger waveforms, we construct our matching method

non-zero eccentricity, employing and testing a more realistic analytic model
for the merger, building a separate model for the ringdown, and optimizing the
matching technique.

asymptotics for the number of walks in certain families of models by applying
the techniques of analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV), where one

the set of steps $\mathcal{S}$ is symmetric over every axis; in this setting
one can always apply the methods of ACSV to a multivariate rational function

must be encoded by multivariate rational functions with non-smooth singular
sets. In the process, our analysis connects past work to deeper structural
results in the theory of analytic combinatorics in several variables. One
application is a closed form for asymptotics of models defined by step sets

conduction band of 18-22nm HgTe quantum wells under applied top-gate voltage.
Analysis of the beatings reveals two electron concentrations at the Fermi level
arising due to Rashba-like spin splitting of the first conduction subband H1.
The difference dN_s in two concentrations as a function of the gate voltage is
qualitatively explained by a proposed toy electrostatic model involving the
surface states localized at quantum well interfaces. Experimental values of
dN_s are also in a good quantitative agreement with self-consistent
calculations of Poisson and Schrodinger equations with eight-band kp
Hamiltonian. Our results clearly demonstrate that the large spin splitting of
the first conduction subband is caused by surface nature of $H1$ states
hybridized with the heavy-hole band.

teaching aims to find the shortest training sequence to drive the learning
algorithm to the target model. We present the first principled way to find such
shortest training sequences. Our key insight is to formulate sequential machine
teaching as a time-optimal control problem. This allows us to solve sequential
teaching by leveraging key theoretical and computational tools developed over
the past 60 years in the optimal control community. Specifically, we study the
Pontryagin Maximum Principle, which yields a necessary condition for optimality
of a training sequence. We present analytic, structural, and numerical
implications of this approach on a case study with a least-squares loss
function and gradient descent learner. We compute optimal training sequences
for this problem, and although the sequences seem circuitous, we find that they
can vastly outperform the best available heuristics for generating training
sequences.

achieve faster training process and better resulting models. However, whether
BN works strongly depends on how the batches are constructed during training

understand BN from an optimization perspective by formulating the optimization
problem which motivates BN. We show when BN works and when BN does not work by
analyzing the optimization problem. We then propose a refinement of BN based on

alleviate the issues of BN when the batches are not constructed ideally. We
provide convergence analysis for FN and empirically study its effectiveness to

video based on visual information, especially the movements of lips. It is also
referenced as lipreading. Motivated by two problems existing in lipreading,
words with similar pronunciation and the variation of word duration, we propose
a novel 3D Feature Pyramid Attention (3D-FPA) module to jointly improve the
representation power of features in both the spatial and temporal domains.
Specifically, the input features are downsampled for 3 times in both the
spatial and temporal dimensions to construct spatiotemporal feature pyramids.
Then high-level features are upsampled and combined with low-level features,
finally generating a pixel-level soft attention mask to be multiplied with the
input features.It enhances the discriminative power of features and exploits
the temporal multi-scale information while decoding the visual speeches. Also,
this module provides a new method to construct and utilize temporal pyramid
structures in video analysis tasks. The field of temporal featrue pyramids are
still under exploring compared to the plentiful works on spatial feature
pyramids for image analysis tasks. To validate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our proposed module, we embed the module in a sentence-level
lipreading model, LipNet, with the result of 3.6% absolute decrease in word
error rate, and a word-level model, with the result of 1.4% absolute
improvement in accuracy.

$\mathbb{F}$ the real, complex, or quaternion numbers. This metric arises from
the Lipschitz-equivalence of all norms on $\mathbb{F}^k$, and seems to be
unexplored in the literature. We initiate the study of the associated quotient
metric space, and show that it is complete, connected, and non-compact. In
particular, the new topology is strictly coarser than that of the Banach-Mazur
compactum. For example, for each $k \geqslant 2$ the metric subspace $\{ \|
\cdot \|_p : p \in [1,\infty] \}$ maps isometrically and monotonically to $[0,
\log k]$ (or $[0,1]$ by scaling the norm), again unlike in the Banach-Mazur
compactum.
  Our analysis goes through embedding the above quotient space into a normed
space, and reveals an implicit functorial construction of function spaces with
diameter norms (as well as a variant of the distortion). In particular, we
realize the above quotient space of norms as a normed space.
  We next study the parallel setting of the - also hitherto unexplored - metric
space $\mathcal{S}([n])$ of all metrics on a finite set of $n$ elements,
revealing the connection between log-distortion and diameter norms. In
particular, we show that $\mathcal{S}([n])$ is also a normed space. We
demonstrate embeddings of equivalence classes of finite metric spaces (parallel
to the Gromov-Hausdorff setting), as well as of $\mathcal{S}([n-1])$, into
$\mathcal{S}([n])$. We conclude by discussing extensions to norms on an
arbitrary Banach space and to discrete metrics on any set, as well as some
questions in both settings above.

Multiple observations indicate that a high concentration of dust grains, from

events. We propose a new mechanism that can send large amounts of dust close to
the star on short timescales, through the reactivation of a dead zone in the
protoplanetary disk. Using numerical simulations we model the accretion of gas
and dust, along with the growth and fragmentation of particles in this

dust is rapidly accreted towards the star in around 15 years, at rates of
$\dot{M}_\textrm{d} = 6 \times 10^{-6}\, \textrm{M}_\odot/\textrm{yr}$ and
reaching dust-to-gas ratios of $\epsilon \approx 5$, preceding an increase in
the gas accretion by a few years. This sudden rise of dust accretion can
provide the material required for the dimmings, although the question of how to
put the dust into the line of sight remains open to speculation.

is found that this image similarity measure is an extended Mumford-Shah

of Hausdorff measures of the common and different parts of image edges from

investigate if the stars have similar properties, which could be an indication
that they are physically bound into a binary system. While one star lies on the
red giant branch (RGB), the other, more evolved star, is either a RGB or
asymptotic-giant-branch star. We found similar ages for the red giants and a
mass ratio close to 1. Based on these asteroseismic results we propose KIC

combining the asteroseismic data with ground-based $BVI$ photometry we
estimated different distances for the stars, which we cross-checked with $Gaia$
DR2. From $Gaia$ we obtained for one object a distance between and broadly
consistent with the distances from $BVI$ photometry. For the other object we
have a negative parallax with a not yet reliable $Gaia$ distance solution. The
derived distances challenge a binary interpretation and may either point to a
triple system, which could explain the visible magnitudes, or, to a rare chance
alignment ($\sim 0.05\%$ chance based on stellar magnitudes). This probability

spin textures, are of wide conceptual and practical appeal for quantum
information technologies, notably in relation to the making of so-called
race-track memory devices. Skyrmions can be created, steered and destroyed with
magnetic fields and/or (spin) currents. Here we focus on the latter mechanism,
analyzed via a microscopic treatment of the skyrmion-current interaction. The
system we consider is an isolated skyrmion in a square-lattice cluster,
interacting with electrons spins in a current-carrying quantum wire. For the
theoretical description, we employ a quantum formulation of spin-dependent
currents via nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) within the generalized
Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA). This is combined with a treatment of skyrmions
based on classical localized spins, with the skyrmion motion described via
Ehrenfest dynamics. With our mixed quantum-classical scheme, we assess how
time-dependent currents can affect the skyrmion dynamics, and how this in turn
depends on electron-electron and spin-orbit interactions in the wire. Our study
shows the usefulness of a quantum-classical treatment of skyrmion steering via
currents, as a way for example to validate/extract an effective,
classical-only, description of skyrmion dynamics from a microscopic quantum
modeling of the skyrmion-current interaction.

carefully considered in the transmission constrained unit commitment (TCUC)

closely related to the vertex number of the uncertainty set. The vertex number
is further associated with 1) the period number in the scheduling horizon as
well as 2) the number of nodes with uncertain injections. In this paper, a
column merging method (CMM) is proposed to reduce the computation burden by
merging the uncertain nodes, while still guar-anteeing the robustness of the

parameters obtained based on an analytical solution of a uniform approximation
problem, so that the computational time is negligi-ble. The CMM is applied
under a greedy-algorithm based framework, where the number of merged nodes and
the ap-proximation error can be well balanced. The CMM is designed as a

representations. In literature, autoencoders have shown to perform well on a
variety of tasks spread across multiple domains, thereby establishing
widespread applicability. Typically, an autoencoder is trained to generate a
model that minimizes the reconstruction error between the input and the
reconstructed output, computed in terms of the Euclidean distance. While this
can be useful for applications related to unsupervised reconstruction, it may
not be optimal for classification. In this paper, we propose a novel Supervised
COSMOS Autoencoder which utilizes a multi-objective loss function to learn
representations that simultaneously encode the (i) ""similarity"" between the
input and reconstructed vectors in terms of their direction, (ii)
""distribution"" of pixel values of the reconstruction with respect to the input
sample, while also incorporating (iii) ""discriminability"" in the feature
learning pipeline. The proposed autoencoder model incorporates a Cosine
similarity and Mahalanobis distance based loss function, along with supervision
via Mutual Information based loss. Detailed analysis of each component of the

demonstrated via extensive experimental evaluations on different image

coarse gate locations, which can be easily estimated from a single

incorporated by an extended Kalman filter to maintain optimal
maximum-a-posteriori estimates of gate locations. This allows the framework to
cope with misleading high-variance estimates that could stem from poor
observability or lack of visible gates. Given the estimated gate poses, we use
model predictive control to quickly and accurately navigate through the track.

$\Delta_0/k_{\rm B}\simeq 21.4$ K. Both NMR shift and spin-lattice relaxation
rate show an activated behavior at low temperatures, further confirming the
singlet ground state. The spin chains do not coincide with the structural
chains, whereas the couplings between the spin chains are frustrated. Because

  Clustering Approach","This manuscript was submitted to TCom",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In one of the several manifestations, the future cellular networks are
required to accommodate a massive number of devices; several orders of
magnitude compared to today's networks. At the same time, the future cellular
networks will have to fulfill stringent latency constraints. To that end, one
problem that is posed as a potential showstopper is extreme congestion for
requesting uplink scheduling over the physical random access channel (PRACH).
Indeed, such congestion drags along scheduling delay problems. In this paper,
the use of self-organized device-to-device (D2D) clustering is advocated for
mitigating PRACH congestion. To this end, the paper proposes two D2D clustering
schemes, namely; Random-Based Clustering (RBC) and Channel-Gain-Based
Clustering (CGBC). Accordingly, this paper sheds light on random access within
the proposed D2D clustering schemes and presents a case study based on a
stochastic geometry framework. For the sake of objective evaluation, the D2D
clustering is benchmarked by the conventional scheduling request procedure.
Accordingly, the paper offers insights into useful scenarios that minimize the
scheduling delay for each clustering scheme. Finally, the paper discusses the
implementation algorithm and some potential implementation issues and remedies.

characteristics on the nonequilibrium dynamics of a closed quantum system are
closely related to the equilibrium phase transitions. Specifically, the return
probability of the system to its initial state (Loschmidt echo), in the finite
size system, is expected to exhibit very nice periodicity after a sudden quench
to a quantum critical point. Where the periodicity of the revivals scales
inversely with the maximum of the group velocity. We show that, contrary to
expectations, the periodicity of the return probability breaks for a sudden
quench to the non-trivial quantum critical point. Further, We find that, the
periodicity of return probability scales inversely with the group velocity at
the gap closing point for a quench to the trivial critical point of truly
long-range pairing case, $\alpha < 1$. In addition, analyzing the effect of
averaging quenched disorder shows that the revivals in the short range pairing
cases are more robust against disorder than that of the long rang pairing case.
We also study the effect of disorder on the non-analyticities of rate function
of the return probability which introduced as a witness of the dynamical phase

this problem is easier to tackle using solar wind measurements closer to the
Sun than 1 AU, where the mixing and dynamical interaction of different solar
wind streams is reduced. Using measurements from the Helios mission, we
examined how the proton core temperature anisotropy and cross helicity varied
with distance. At 0.3 AU there are two clearly separated anisotropic and
isotropic populations of solar wind, that are not distinguishable at 1 AU. The
anisotropic population is always Alfv\'enic and spans a wide range of speeds.
In contrast the isotropic population has slow speeds, and contains a mix of
Alfv\'enic wind with constant mass fluxes, and non-Alfv\'enic wind with large
and highly varying mass fluxes. We split the in-situ measurements into three
categories according these observations, and suggest that these categories
correspond to wind that originated in the core of coronal holes, in or near
active regions or the edges of coronal holes, and as small transients form
streamers or pseudostreamers. Although our method by itself is simplistic, it
provides a new tool that can be used in combination with other methods for

effect (QAHE) which provides quantized edge states for lossless charge
transport applications. The edge states are hosted by a magnetic energy gap at
the Dirac point but all attempts to observe it directly have been unsuccessful.
The gap size is considered crucial to overcoming the present limitations of the
QAHE, which so far occurs only at temperatures one to two orders of magnitude
below its principle limit set by the ferromagnetic Curie temperature $T_C$.
Here, we use low temperature photoelectron spectroscopy to unambiguously reveal
the magnetic gap of Mn-doped Bi$_2$Te$_3$ films, which is present only below
$T_C$. Surprisingly, the gap turns out to be $\sim$90 meV wide, which not only
exceeds $k_BT$ at room temperature but is also 5 times larger than predicted by
density functional theory. By an exhaustive multiscale structure
characterization we show that this enhancement is due to a remarkable structure
modification induced by Mn doping. Instead of a disordered impurity system, it
forms an alternating sequence of septuple and quintuple layer blocks, where Mn
is predominantly incorporated in the septuple layers. This self-organized
heterostructure substantially enhances the wave-function overlap and the size
of the magnetic gap at the Dirac point, as recently predicted. Mn-doped
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ forms a similar heterostructure, however, only a large,
nonmagnetic gap is formed. We explain both differences based on the higher
spin-orbit interaction in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ with the most important consequence of a
magnetic anisotropy perpendicular to the films, whereas for Bi$_2$Se$_3$ the
spin-orbit interaction it is too weak to overcome the dipole-dipole
interaction. Our findings provide crucial insights for pushing the lossless
transport properties of topological insulators towards room-temperature
applications.

elongated ENLRs reaching 4 to 19 kpc from the nucleus and bipolar ionization
cones in [OIII]/(H$\alpha$+[NII]) excitation maps indicating that the torus
survives these luminosities, allowing the escape of $\approx$10 times higher
ionizing photon rates along the ionization axis than perpendicularly to it. The
exceptional HST angular resolution was key to our success in arriving at these
conclusions. Combining our measurements with previous ones based on similar HST
data, we have revisited the relation between the ENLR radius R$_{maj}$ (in pc)
and L[OIII] (in erg s$^{-1}$) over the range $39<$log(L[OIII])$<43.5$:
log(R$_{maj}) = (0.51\pm0.03)$ log(L[OIII])$-18.12\pm0.98$. The radius of the

extend to distances beyond the limit of the galaxy if gas is present there $-$
e.g. from AGN outflows or interactions, seen in 6 objects of our sample. We
attribute the flattening previously seen in this relation to the fact that the
ENLR is matter-bounded, meaning that ionizing photons usually escape to the
intergalactic medium in luminous AGN. Estimated ionized gas masses of the ENLRs

so-called metamagnetism is an example of such a behavior, when an
antiferromagnetic and field-induced spin-polarized paramagnetic/ferromagnetic

combining experiment with theoretical analysis, we show that a different type
of mixed state between antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetism can be created in

we observe a field-driven spin-state in the layered antiferromagnet Ca3Ru2O7,

antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic parts. We call this state a metamagnetic
texture and explain its appearance by the chiral twisting effects of the
asymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) exchange. The observation can be
understood as an extraordinary coexistence, in one thermodynamic state, of spin
orders belonging to different symmetries. Experimentally, the complex nature of
this metamagnetic state is demonstrated by measurements of anomalies in
electronic transport which reflect the spin-polarization in the metamagnetic
texture, determination of the magnetic orbital moments, which supports the
existence of strong spin-orbit effects, a pre-requisite for the mechanism of
twisted magnetic states in this material.

  Integrated with Transient Performance Improvement Problem",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the consensus performance improvement problem of
networked general linear agents subject to external disturbances over Markovian
randomly switching communication topologies. The consensus control laws can
only use its local output information. Firstly, a class of full-order
observer-based control protocols is proposed to solve this problem, which
depends solely on the relative outputs of neighbours. Then, to eliminate the
redundancy involved in the full-order observer, a class of reduced-order
observer-based control protocols is designed. Algorithms to construct both
protocols are presented, which guarantee that agents can reach consensus in the
asymptotic mean square sense when they are not perturbed by disturbances, and
that they have decent $H_{\infty}$ performance and transient performance when
the disturbances exist. At the end of this manuscript, numerical simulations
which apply both algorithms to four networked Raptor-90 helicopters are
performed to verify the theoretical results.

We say that the uncertainty set is admissible for the initial electrical state

use the recently proposed V-control and show two new results. First, if a
complex nodal voltage set V is convex and every element in V is nonsingular,
then V is a domain of uniqueness. Second, we give sufficient conditions to

need to pick a set of centers that is an independent set of a matroid with rank
$r$. We study this problem in streaming, where elements of the ground set
arrive in the stream. We first show that any randomized one-pass streaming
algorithm that computes a better than $\Delta$-approximation for
partition-matroid center must use $\Omega(r^2)$ bits of space, where $\Delta$
is the aspect ratio of the metric and can be arbitrarily large. This shows a
quadratic separation between matroid center and $k$-center, for which the
Doubling algorithm gives an $8$-approximation using $O(k)$-space and one pass.
To complement this, we give a one-pass algorithm for matroid center that stores
at most $O(r^2\log(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon)$ points (viz., stream summary)
among which a $(7+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution exists, which can be found
by brute force, or a $(17+\varepsilon)$-approximation can be found with an
efficient algorithm. If we are allowed a second pass, we can compute a
$(3+\varepsilon)$-approximation efficiently; this also achieves almost the
known-best approximation ratio (of $3+\varepsilon$) with total running time of
$O((nr + r^{3.5})\log(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon + r^2(\log

  We also consider the problem of matroid center with $z$ outliers and give a
one-pass algorithm that outputs a set of
$O((r^2+rz)\log(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon)$ points that contains a
$(15+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution. Our techniques extend to knapsack
center and knapsack center with outliers in a straightforward way, and we get
algorithms that use space linear in the size of a largest feasible set (as

a two-stage feature transfer learning method focusing on the recognition of

the two-stage feature transfer achieves the best performance compared to a

investigated the robustness of the target dataset, based on size. Two-stage
feature transfer shows better robustness than the other two learning methods.
Moreover, we analyzed the feature representations obtained from DLDs imagery

that the two-stage feature transfer obtains both edge and textural features of

kinematic matching with light dark matter particles, copious production of

mimic accelerating particles in curved space-times. The different curved shapes
of structures are used to mimic different accelerating frames. The different

rankings/permutations, on the premise that the collection of items under study
can be partitioned into subsets/buckets, such that, with high probability,
items in a certain bucket are either all ranked higher or else all ranked lower
than items in another bucket. In this context, $\Sigma$'s distribution can be
hopefully represented in a sparse manner by a bucket distribution, i.e. a
bucket ordering plus the ranking distributions within each bucket. More
precisely, we introduce a dedicated distortion measure, based on a mass
transportation metric, in order to quantify the accuracy of such
representations. The performance of buckets minimizing an empirical version of
the distortion is investigated through a rate bound analysis. Complexity
penalization techniques are also considered to select the shape of a bucket
order with minimum expected distortion. Beyond theoretical concepts and
results, numerical experiments on real ranking data are displayed in order to
provide empirical evidence of the relevance of the approach promoted.

introduction of any basis or coordinates. In the formalism, a spacetime which
has a timelike congruence is assumed. Then, tensors are split into temporal and
spatial parts according to the tangent direction to the congruence. I make use
of the natural derivatives to define the kinematical quantities and to
investigate their properties. They are utilized in the splitting of covariant
derivatives. In this way, the Riemann curvature is split into the temporal and
spatial part, i.e. Gauss, Codazzi, and Ricci relation. Finally, the splitting
of the Einstein equation is achieved by contraction. Choosing congruence as
normal to a spacelike hypersurface, the formalism reduces to 3+1 formalism.
This approach deepens our understanding of 3+1 formalism. All these processes
are performed in a covariant manner without the complexities caused by the
introduction of a coordinate system or basis.

practical applications, microgels are also extremely important to tackle

maximum likelihood parameter estimation of the new model. Interestingly, the
proposed model is shown to provide a perfect fit with the measured data under
all channel conditions for both types of water. The major advantage of the new
model is that it has a simple mathematical form making it attractive from a
performance analysis point of view. Indeed, we show that the application of the
EGG model leads to closed-form and analytically tractable expressions for key
UWOC system performance metrics such as the outage probability, the average
bit-error rate, and the ergodic capacity. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first-ever comprehensive channel model addressing the statistics of optical
beam irradiance fluctuations in underwater wireless optical channels due to

Hubble function which predicts a dynamical Dark Energy (DE) and a dynamical
Dark Matter (DM) described by new entropic terms and by the equations of state
w_0=-1 and w_M=0, respectively, at all z. We posit that the spacetime has a
quantum structure described by the Quantum information theory. We identify the
space quanta \rho with two-qubit quantum states of of massless gravitons with
helicity states |\pm 2>. All space quanta carry quantum information entropy
S(\rho). All entangled quanta carry entanglement entropy S_E(\rho) and form DE.
All non-entangled quanta form DM. In the absence of Baryonic matter DM and SE
are described by probability distributions p(\vec{x},S) and q(\vec{x},\chi)
where \chi=S_E(\rho)+S(\rho). Fisher information metric generates from these
distributions the vacuum gravitational fields of DM and DE. Tn the presence of
the Baryonic matter the distributions are displaced p->p' and q->q'. Fisher
metric then defines the displaced fields. In Einstein's theory of General
relativity Space is a gravitational field which we identify with the
gravitational fields of DE and DM. The theory predicts the existence of a new
""residual"" matter term with equation of state w_r=-1/3 in the Hubble function,
and a negative spatial curvature the consequence of which are constraints on
cosmological parameters. We recover Robertson-Walker metric and the Friedmann
equations from the gravitational fields of Dark Energy and Dark Matter at

work, we propose to learn the relationship between sky appearance and the
future photovoltaic power output using deep learning. We train several variants
of convolutional neural networks which take historical photovoltaic power
values and sky images as input and estimate photovoltaic power in a very short

processes. This necessitates exploratory mediation analysis, for which
structural equation modeling is the benchmark method. However, this method
cannot perform mediation analysis with more variables than observations. One
option is to run a series of univariate mediation models, which incorrectly
assumes independence of the mediators. Another option is regularization, but
the available implementations may lead to high false positive rates. In this
paper, we develop a hybrid approach which uses components of both filter and
regularization: the 'Coordinate-wise Mediation Filter'. It performs filtering
conditional on the other selected mediators. We show through simulation that it
improves performance over existing methods. Finally, we provide an empirical
example, showing how our method may be used for epigenetic research.

Sun's corona, resulting in plasma heating, mass motions, particle acceleration,
and radiation emitted from radio to $\gamma$-ray wavelengths. They are
associated with global coronal eruptions of plasma into the interplanetary
medium---coronal mass ejections---that can result in a variety of ""space

$\sim\!10^{23}$ ergs (nanoflares) to more than $10^{32}$ ergs. Solar flares are
a phenomenon of general astrophysical interest, allowing detailed study of
magnetic energy release, eruptive processes, shock formation and propagation,
particle acceleration and transport, and radiative processes. Observations at
radio wavelengths offer unique diagnostics of the physics of flares. To fully
exploit these diagnostics requires the means of performing time-resolved
imaging spectropolarimetry. Recent observations with the Jansky Very Large

extensive development in forward modeling, have demonstrated the power of the

break the quandary by lowering the receiver's required quantum capability so
that secure communications can be implemented on a portable device. However,
all SQC protocols have low qubit efficiency and complex hardware

Entanglement Preservation Time (EPT) and linear quregister size. In this paper,
we propose two new keyless SQC protocols that address the aforementioned
weaknesses. They are named Economic Keyless Semi-Quantum Point-to-point

theoretically constant minimal EPT and quregister size, regardless of message

environmental perturbations. The protocols are based on a new quantum message
transmission operation termed Tele-Fetch. Like QKD, their strength depends on
physical principles rather than mathematical complexity.

parameter under the alternative, and some parameters are possibly weakly or
non-identified. We focus on a Bierens (1990)-type conditional moment test of
omitted nonlinearity for convenience, and because of difficulties that have
been ignored to date. Existing methods include the supremum p-value which
promotes a conservative test that is generally not consistent, and test
statistic transforms like the supremum and average for which bootstrap methods
are not valid under weak identification. We propose a new wild bootstrap method
for p-value computation by targeting specific identification cases. We then
combine bootstrapped p-values across polar identification cases to form an
asymptotically valid p-value approximation that is robust to any identification
case. The wild bootstrap does not require knowledge of the covariance structure
of the bootstrapped processes, whereas Andrews and Cheng's (2012, 2013, 2014)
simulation approach generally does. Our method allows for robust bootstrap
critical value computation as well. Our bootstrap method (like conventional
ones) does not lead to a consistent p-value approximation for test statistic
functions like the supremum and average. We therefore smooth over the robust
bootstrapped p-value as the basis for several tests which achieve the correct
asymptotic level, and are consistent, for any degree of identification. They
also achieve uniform size control. A simulation study reveals possibly large
empirical size distortions in non-robust tests when weak or non-identification
arises. One of our smoothed p-value tests, however, dominates all other tests
by delivering accurate empirical size and comparatively high power.

radio pulsars may not exist, implying the population of neutron stars that
exhibit both radio pulsations and bursting activities could be potentially
large. In this situation, new insights into the burst mechanism could be gained
by combining the temporal behavior of radio pulsations. We present a general
model for radio suppression by relativistic $e^{\pm}$ plasma outflows at the
onset of magnetar flares. A sudden ejection of magnetic energy into the
magnetosphere would generate a fireball plasma, which is promptly driven to
expand at relativistic speed. This would make the plasma cutoff frequency
significantly higher than the rest frame radio frequency, resulting in the
suppression of radio waves. We analytically show that any GHz radio emission
arising from the magnetosphere is suppressed for $\sim100\ {\rm s}$, depending
on the total fireball energy. On the other hand, thermal radiation is expected
from the hot spot(s) on the stellar surface created by an inflow of dense
plasma, which could be the origin of short bursts. Since our hypothesis
predicts radio suppression in coincidence with short bursts, this could be an
indirect method to constrain the occurrence rate of short bursts at the faint
end that remain undetected by X-ray detectors. Furthermore, ultra-fast
gamma-ray flashes from the fireball photosphere is also expected as a smoking
gun, although the onboard detection is challenging due to its extremely short
duration $\sim\mu$s. Finally, our model is applied to the radio pulsar with
magnetar-like activities, PSR J1119-6127 in light of recent observations.
Implications for fast radio bursts and the possibility of plasma lensing are

  lowering","Main text and suppl. info",,,,"physics.atom-ph cond-mat.other physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For atoms and crystals with an ideal symmetry, the optical selection rules
for electronic transitions are well covered in physics textbooks. However, in
studies of material systems one often encounters systems with a weakly
distorted symmetry. Insight and intuition for how optical selection rules
change when an ideal symmetry is gradually distorted is, nevertheless, little
addressed in literature. We present here a detailed analysis of how a gradual
symmetry distortion leads to a complete alteration of optical selection rules.
As a model system, we consider the transitions between $1s$ and $2p$ sublevels
of the hydrogen atom, which get distorted by placing charged particles in its
environment. Upon increasing the distortion, part of the optical selection
rules evolve from circular via elliptical to linear character, with an
associated evolution between allowed and forbidden transitions. Our
presentation combines an analytical approach with quantitative results from
numerical simulations, thus providing insight in how the evolution occurs as a
function of the strength of the distortion.

UV/optical bands declines more than one order of magnitude in some tidal
disruption events (TDEs). The physics behind it is still a mystery. A strong
outflow can be driven by the radiation of the disc with super-Eddington
luminosity. The disc emission drops rapidly to sub-Eddington luminosity, and
the gas may fall back to the black hole. An optically thick shell is formed
with gas temperature $\la 5\times 10^4$K due to line absorption, which is
irradiated by the disc, and is re-emitting UV/optical photons. As the shell
moves inwards, the gas at the inner surface of the shell is completely ionized
at a certain temperature $\sim 10^4-5\times 10^4$K, which makes the gas
optically thin for line absorption, and it therefore falls from the shell. This
line absorbing layer acts as temperature regulator, i.e., the gas in the inner
shell surface is removed to reduce the shell mass while the temperature is
rising, and the decrease of the shell mass (gravity) decelerates the shell till
a new balance is achieved between the radiation force and the gravity. This
failed-outflow model can naturally explain the declining UV/optical blackbody
radiation with constant temperature.

problem that comes to prominence in recent years with the increasing demand of

method-- unsupervised ensemble learning via Ising model approximation (unElisa)
that combines a pruning step with a predicting step. We focus on the binary
case and use an Ising model to characterize interactions between the ensemble
and the underlying true classifier. The presence of an edge between an observed
classifier and the true classifier indicates a direct dependence whereas the
absence indicates the corresponding one provides no additional information and
shall be eliminated. This observation leads to the pruning step where the key
is to recover the neighborhood of the true classifier. We show that it can be
recovered successfully with exponentially decaying error in the
high-dimensional setting by performing nodewise $\ell_1$-regularized logistic
regression. The pruned ensemble allows us to get a consistent estimate of the
Bayes classifier for predicting. We also propose an augmented version of

networks. These estimates are nearly optimal in the sense that the error rates
scale in the same way as the Monte Carlo error rates. They are equally
effective in the over-parametrized regime when the network size is much larger
than the size of the dataset. These new estimates are a priori in nature in the
sense that the bounds depend only on some norms of the underlying functions to
be fitted, not the parameters in the model, in contrast with most existing
results which are a posteriori in nature. Using these a priori estimates, we
provide a perspective for understanding why two-layer neural networks perform
better than the related kernel methods.

for highly anisotropic ionic $g$-tensors expected for this material and taking
into account the strongly competing interactions between the spins which lead

of information that can be collected. As a consequence, data from opinion polls
are often reported in simple percentages and analyzed non-parametrically. In
this paper, response data on just four questions from a national opinion poll
were used to demonstrate that a parametric scale can be constructed using item
response modeling approaches. Developing a parametric scale yields
interval-level measures which are more useful than the strictly ordinal-level
measures obtained from Likert-type scales common in opinion polls. The metric
that was developed in this paper, a measure of religious morality, can be
processed and used in a wider range of statistical analyses compared to
conventional approaches of simply reporting percentages at item-level. Finally,
this paper reports the item parameters so that researchers can adopt these

the repulsive interaction, which leads to the sign reversal of superconducting
gaps along the Fermi surfaces (FS) or between them. However, to measure this
sign change is not easy and straightforward. It is known that, in
superconductors with sign reversal gaps, non-magnetic impurities can break
Cooper pairs leading to the quasiparticle density of states in the
superconducting state. The standing waves of these quasiparticles will
interfere each other leading to the quasiparticle interference (QPI) pattern
which carries the phase message reflecting also the superconducting gap
structure. Based on the recently proposed defect-bound-state QPI technique, we
explore the applicability of this technique to a typical iron based
superconductor FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ with roughly equivalent gap values on
the electron and hole pockets connected by the wave vector q_2=(0,\pi). It is
found that, on the negative energy side, with the energy slightly below the gap
value, the phase reference quantity $|g(q,-E)|\cos(\theta_{q,+E}-\theta_{q,-E})
becomes negative and the amplitude is strongly enhanced with the scattering
vector q_2, but that corresponding to the scattering between the
electron-electron pockets, namely q_3=(\pi,\pi), keeps all positive. This is
well consistent with the theoretical expectation of the s^+- pairing gap and
thus serves as a direct visualization of the sign reversal gaps. This
experimental observation is also supported by the theoretical calculations with
the Fermi surface structure and s^+- pairing gap.

Stokes and continuity equations and the water flux inside the biofilm by the
Brinkman and continuity equations. The nutrients are transported in the water
phase by convection and diffusion. This pore-scale model includes variations of
the biofilm composition and size due to reproduction of bacteria, production of

class of materials, exhibiting properties thought to be equivalent to those of
glasses aged for thousands of years. Exerting control over the structure and
properties of PVD glasses formed with different types of glass-forming
molecules is now an emerging challenge. In this work, we study coarse grained
models of organic glass formers containing fluorocarbon tails of increasing
length, corresponding to an increased tendency to form microstructures. We use
simulated PVD to examine how the presence of the microphase separated domains
in the supercooled liquid influences the ability to form stable glasses. This
model suggests that increasing molecule tail length results in decreased
thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the molecules in PVD films. The reduced
stability is further linked to the reduced ability of these molecules to
equilibrate at the free surface during PVD. We find that as the tail length is
increased, the relaxation time near the surface of the supercooled equilibrium
liquid films of these molecules are slowed and become essentially bulk-like,
due to the segregation of the fluorocarbon tails to the free surface. Surface
diffusion is also markedly reduced due to clustering of the molecules at the
surface. Based on these results, we propose a trapping mechanism where tails
are unable to move between local phase separated domains on the relevant
deposition time scales.

credible set for an approximate posterior which is not proportional to the
product of ideal likelihood and prior. We estimate the realised posterior
coverage achieved by the approximate credible set. This is the coverage of the
unknown ``true'' parameter if the data are a realisation of the user's ideal
observation model conditioned on the parameter, and the parameter is a draw
from the user's ideal prior. In one approach we estimate the posterior coverage
at the data by making a semi-parametric logistic regression of binary coverage
outcomes on simulated data against summary statistics evaluated on simulated

windowing simulated data to fall close to the observed data. We illustrate our

into an outburst, and was the subject of numerous, quasi-simultaneous,
multi-wavelength observations in the radio, infrared, optical and X-rays. In
this paper, we model its multi-wavelength radio to optical spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) with an internal shock jet model. The jet emission is
modelled on five dates of the outburst, during which the source is in the hard
and hard intermediate X-ray spectral states. The model assumes that
fluctuations of the jet velocity are driven by the variability in the accretion
flow which is traced by the observed X-ray timing properties of the source.
While the global shape of the SED is well reproduced by this model for all the
studied observations, the variations in bolometric flux and typical energies
require at least two parameters to evolve during the outburst. Here we
investigate variations of the jet power and mean Lorentz factor, which are both
found to increase with the source luminosity. Our results are compatible with
the evolution of the jet Lorentz factor reported in earlier studies of this
source. However, due to the large degeneracy of the parameters of the ishem
model, our proposed scenario is not unique.

We identify Dark Matter and Dark Energy as the gravitational fields generated

consistency with the curvature term in the Robertson-Walker metric then
predicts a positive present curvature density \Omega_{c,0} which places
constraints on the cosmological parameters. In this work we test these

opportunities to explore dripline phenomena. The understanding of these systems
requires a solid description of the three-body (core+N+N) continuum. The
identification of a state with resonant character from the background of
non-resonant continuum states in the same energy range poses a theoretical
challenge. It is the purpose of this work to establish a robust theoretical
framework to identify and characterize three-body resonances in a discrete
basis. A resonance operator is proposed, which describes the sensitivity to
changes in the potential. Resonances are then identified from the lowest
eigenstates of the resonance operator. The operator is diagonalized in a basis
of Hamiltonian pseudostates, built within the hyperspherical harmonics
formalism using the analytical THO basis. The energy and width of the resonance
are determined from its time dependence. The method is applied to 16Be in a
14Be+n+n model. An effective core+n potential, fitted to the available
information on the subsystem 15Be, is employed. The 0+ ground state resonance
of 16Be presents a strong dineutron configuration, which favors the picture of
a correlated two-neutron emission. Fitting the three body interaction to the
experimental two-neutron separation energy |S2n|=1.35(10) MeV, the computed
width is Gamma(0+)=0.16 MeV. From the same Hamiltonian, a 2+ resonance is also
predicted with E_r(2+)=2.42 MeV and Gamma(2+)=0.40 MeV. The dineutron
configuration and the computed 0+ width are consistent with previous R-matrix
calculations for the true three-body continuum. The extracted values of the
resonance energy and width converge with the size of the pseudostate basis and
are robust under changes in the basis parameters. This supports the reliability
of the method in describing the properties of unbound core+N+N systems in a
discrete basis.

respect to the invariant distribution of the fast process.
  We exhibit orders of convergence, in both strong and weak senses, in two
relevant situations, depending on the spatial regularity of the fast process
and on the covariance of the Wiener noise in the slow equation. In a very
regular case, strong and weak orders are equal to $\frac12$ and $1$. In a less

  This study extends previous results concerning weak rates of convergence,

applications due to its contribution to more accurate subsequent analyses and
early clinical diagnoses. Single image super resolution (SISR) is an effective
and cost efficient alternative technique to improve the spatial resolution of
MR images. In the past few years, SISR methods based on deep learning
techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on natural images. However, the information is
gradually weakened and training becomes increasingly difficult as the network
deepens. The problem is more serious for medical images because lacking high
quality and effective training samples makes deep models prone to underfitting
or overfitting. Nevertheless, many current models treat the hierarchical
features on different channels equivalently, which is not helpful for the
models to deal with the hierarchical features discriminatively and targetedly.
To this end, we present a novel channel splitting network (CSN) to ease the
representational burden of deep models. The proposed CSN model divides the
hierarchical features into two branches, i.e., residual branch and dense
branch, with different information transmissions. The residual branch is able
to promote feature reuse, while the dense branch is beneficial to the
exploration of new features. Besides, we also adopt the merge-and-run mapping
to facilitate information integration between different branches. Extensive
experiments on various MR images, including proton density (PD), T1 and T2
images, show that the proposed CSN model achieves superior performance over
other state-of-the-art SISR methods.

Legendrian knots is proposed. In general, to apply the method requires a lot of
technical work. In particular, one needs to search all rectangular diagrams of
surfaces realizing certain dividing configurations. In this paper, it is shown
that, in the case when the orientation-preserving symmetry group of the knot is
trivial, this exhaustive search is not needed, which simplifies the procedure
considerably. This allows one to distinguish Legendrian knots in certain cases
when the computation of the known algebraic invariants is infeasible or is not
informative. In particular, it is disproved here that when~$A\subset\mathbb
R^3$ is an annulus tangent to the standard contact structure along~$\partial
A$, then the two components of~$\partial A$ are always equivalent Legendrian
knots. A candidate counterexample was proposed recently by I.\,Dynnikov and
M.\,Prasolov, but the proof of the fact that the two components of~$\partial A$

is also shown here that the problem of comparing two Legendrian knots having

hardware simulator for wavefront sensing and control designed to produce
JWST-like images. A model of the JWST three mirror anas- tigmat is realized
with three lenses in the form of a Cooke triplet, which provides JWST-like
optical quality over a field equivalent to a NIRCam module. An Iris AO
hexagonally segmented mirror stands in for the JWST primary. This setup
successfully produces images extremely similar to expected JWST in-flight point
spread functions (PSFs), and NIRCam images from cryotesting, in terms of the
PSF morphology and sampling relative to the diffraction limit. The segmentation
of the primary mirror into subapertures introduces complexity into wavefront
sensing and control (WFS&C) of large space based telescopes like JWST. JOST
provides a platform for independent analysis of WFS&C scenarios for both
commissioning and maintenance activities on such ob- servatories. We present an
update of the current status of the testbed including both single field and
wide-field alignment results. We assess the optical quality of JOST over a wide
field of view to inform the future imple- mentation of different wavefront
sensing algorithms including the currently implemented Linearized Algorithm for
Phase Diversity (LAPD). JOST complements other work at the Makidon Laboratory
at the Space Telescope Science Institute, including the High-contrast imager
for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) testbed, that investigates coronagraphy
for segmented aperture telescopes. Beyond JWST we intend to use JOST for WFS&C
studies for future large segmented space telescopes such as LUVOIR.

phenomena in the universe including, relativistic jets, supermassive black hole
binaries, and recoiling supermassive black holes. However, many of these
sources cannot be resolved with direct observations. I review how strong
gravitational lensing can be used to elucidate the structures of these sources
from radio frequencies up to very high energy gamma rays. The deep
gravitational potentials surrounding galaxies act as natural gravitational
lenses. These gravitational lenses split background sources into multiple
images, each with a gravitationally-induced time delay. These time delays and
positions of lensed images depend on the source location, and thus, can be used
to infer the spatial origins of the emission. For example, using
gravitationally-induced time delays improves angular resolution of modern
gamma-ray instruments by six orders of magnitude, and provides evidence that
gamma-ray outbursts can be produced at even thousands of light years from a
supermassive black hole, and that the compact radio emission does not always
trace the position of the supermassive black hole. These findings provide
unique physical information about the central structure of active galaxies,
force us to revise our models of operating particle acceleration mechanisms,
and challenge our assumptions about the origin of compact radio emission.
Future surveys, including LSST, SKA, and Euclid, will provide observations for
hundreds of thousands of gravitationally lensed sources, which will allow us to
apply strong gravitational lensing to study the multi-wavelength structure for
large ensembles of sources. This large ensemble of gravitationally lensed
active galaxies will allow us to elucidate the physical origins of
multi-wavelength emissions, their connections to supermassive black holes, and
their cosmic evolution.

radio bursts: They arise by axion star collisions with neutron stars (
accretion disks of galactic black holes ). The axion star as coherent state of
axions with mass $m_a$ generates homogeneous electric field oscillating with
frequency $m_a/2\pi$ under strong magnetic fields. The field makes electrons
coherently oscillate and emit the coherent dipole radiations ( FRBs ). The
radiations stop when thermal fluctuations produced by the oscillation disturb
the coherent oscillations. Thus, the duration of the FRBs is determined by the
time scale of the thermalization; it is much shorter than $1$ms. Line spectra
of the dipole radiations are broadened by the thermal effects. The thermally
broaden spectra have a feature that the bandwidths $\delta\nu$ are proportional
to their center frequencies $\nu_c$. The presence of various center frequencies
( $1.2$GHz$\sim $$7$GHz ) in repeating FRB 121102 is attributed to Doppler
shifts owing to the various relativistic velocities of the accretion disk. On
the other hand, non repeating FRBs do not show such variety of the center
frequencies. They come from the surfaces of neutron stars. The Doppler shift
also makes the durations of the bursts with higher frequencies become shorter.
Because the magnetic fields of the neutron stars are supposed to be stronger
than those of the accretion disks, the peak flux densities of non repeating
FRBs are larger than those of repeating FRB 121102. The strong magnetic fields
of the neutron stars also lead to much wide bandwidths of non repeating FRBs,
which are over the extent of the receiver frequency range. The spectral
features of the recently discovered new repeating FRB 180814.J0422+75 are
coincident with our general analyses of the repeating FRB 121102.

system, in order to do more investigation of the EoS, we evaluate energy, Le
Chatelier's principle and stability conditions. Our results show that the EoS
satisfies these conditions. Considering this EoS, we study the effect of quark
matter on the structure of neutron stars such as maximum mass and the
corresponding radius, average density, compactness, Kretschmann scalar,
Schwarzschild radius, gravitational redshift and dynamical stability. Also,
considering the mentioned EoS in this paper, we find that the maximum mass of
hybrid stars is a little smaller than that of the corresponding pure neutron
star. Indeed the maximum mass of hybrid stars can be quite close to the pure
neutron stars. Our calculations about the dynamical stability show that these
stars are stable against the radial adiabatic infinitesimal perturbations. In
addition, our analyze indicates that neutron stars are under a contraction due
to the existence of quark core.

  Manufacturing Processes",,,,,"cs.CY cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Growing consumer awareness as well as manufacturers' internal quality
requirements lead to novel demands on supply chain traceability. Existing
centralized solutions suffer from isolated data storage and lacking trust when
multiple parties are involved. Decentralized blockchain-based approaches
attempt to overcome these shortcomings by creating digital representations of
physical goods to facilitate tracking across multiple entities. However, they
currently do not capture the transformation of goods in manufacturing
processes. Therefore, the relation between ingredients and product is lost,
limiting the ability to trace a product's provenance. We propose a
blockchain-based supply chain traceability system using smart contracts. In
such contracts, manufacturers define the composition of products in the form of
recipes. Each ingredient of the recipe is a non-fungible token that corresponds
to a batch of physical goods. When the recipe is applied, its ingredients are
consumed and a new token is produced. This mechanism preserves the traceability
of product transformations. The system is implemented for the Ethereum Virtual
Machine and is applicable to any blockchain configuration that supports it. Our
evaluation reveals that the gas costs scale linearly with the number of
products considered in the system. This leads to the conclusion that the
solution can handle complex use cases.

propose a fully distributed matching based association that alleviates the
bottlenecks of bandwidth allocation and guarantees the required quality of
service. Next, to address the 2D positions of UAVs, we adopt a modified version
of K-means algorithm, with a distributed implementation, where UAVs dynamically
change their 2D positions in order to reach the barycenter of the cluster that
is composed of the served ground users. In order to optimize the UAVs
altitudes, we study a naturally defined game-theoretic version of the problem
and show that under fixed UAVs 2D coordinates, a predefined association scheme,
and limited-interference, the UAVs altitudes game is a non-cooperative
potential game where the players (UAVs) can maximize the limited-interference
sum-rate by only optimizing a local utility function. Therefore, we adopt the
best response dynamics to reach a Nash equilibrium of the game which is also a
local optimum of the social welfare function. Our simulation results show that,
using the proposed approach, the network's sum rate of the studied scenario is
improved as compared with the trivial case where the classical version of
