of a large fraction of them remain unexplained. It is still unclear whether a
single inflation mechanism is enough to explain the entire distribution of
radii, or whether a combination of them is needed. We seek to understand the
relationship of hot Jupiter radii with stellar irradiation and mass. We also
aim to find the intrinsic physical scatter in their radii caused by
unobservable parameters. By constructing a hierarchical Bayesian model, we
infer the probabilistic relation between planet radius, mass and incident flux
for a sample of 286 gas giants. We separately incorporate the observational
uncertainties of the data and the intrinsic physical scatter in the population.
This allows us to treat the intrinsic physical scatter in radii (due to latent
parameters such as the heavy element fraction) as a parameter to be inferred.
We find that the planetary mass plays a key role in the inflation extent, with
planets in the range between 0.37 - 0.98 MJ showing the most inflated radii. At
higher masses, the radius response to incident flux begins to decrease. Below a
threshold of 0.37 +- 0.03 MJ we find that giant exoplanets as a population are
unable to maintain inflated radii greater than 1.4 RJ but instead exhibit
smaller sizes as the incident flux is increased beyond 10^6 Wm-2. We also find
that below 1 MJ, there is a cutoff point at high incident flux beyond which we
find no more inflated planets, and that this cutoff point decreases as the mass
decreases. At incident fluxes higher than 1.6*10^6 Wm -2 and in a mass range
0.37 - 0.98 MJ, we find no evidence for a population of non-inflated hot

computationally intensive, requiring complex hydrodynamic codes and substantial
computing power. It would be advantageous if computationally simpler models
could provide some preliminary information on these disks. Here we apply a
particle-only model (that we developed for gas-poor debris disks) to the
gas-rich disk, HL Tauri, to address the question of whether such simple models
can inform the study of these systems. Assuming three potentially embedded
planets, we match HL Tau's radial profile fairly well and derive best-fit
planetary masses and orbital radii (0.40, 0.02, 0.21 Jupiter masses for the
planets orbiting a 0.55 solar-mass star at 11.22, 29.67, 64.23 AU). Our derived
parameters are comparable to those estimated by others, except for the mass of
the second planet. Our simulations also reproduce some narrower gaps seen in
the ALMA image away from the orbits of the planets. The nature of these gaps is
debated but, based on our simulations, we argue they could result from
planet-disk interactions via mean-motion resonances, and need not contain
planets. Our results suggest that a simple particle-only model can be used as a
first step to understanding dynamical structures in gas disks, particularly
those formed by planets, and determine some parameters of their hidden planets,
serving as useful initial inputs to hydrodynamic models which are needed to
investigate disk and planet properties more thoroughly.

perception and action. At the core of this investigation is the idea of
modeling affordances(Affordances are opportunities of interaction in the scene.
In other words, it represents what actions can the object be used for).
However, when it comes to predicting affordances, even the state of the art
approaches still do not use any ConvNets. Why is that? Unlike semantic or 3D
tasks, there still does not exist any large-scale dataset for affordances. In
this paper, we tackle the challenge of creating one of the biggest dataset for
learning affordances. We use seven sitcoms to extract a diverse set of scenes
and how actors interact with different objects in the scenes. Our dataset
consists of more than 10K scenes and 28K ways humans can interact with these
10K images. We also propose a two-step approach to predict affordances in a new
scene. In the first step, given a location in the scene we classify which of
the 30 pose classes is the likely affordance pose. Given the pose class and the
scene, we then use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to extract the scale and
deformation of the pose. The VAE allows us to sample the distribution of
possible poses at test time. Finally, we show the importance of large-scale
data in learning a generalizable and robust model of affordances.

an attribute-centered loss is proposed which learns several distinct centers,

and pairs of testified attributes and corresponding forensic sketches around
their associated centers, while preserving the spatial topology information.
Importantly, the centers learn to keep a relative distance from each other,
related to their number of contradictory attributes. Extensive experiments are
performed on composite (E-PRIP) and semi-forensic (IIIT-D Semi-forensic)
databases. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.

This study addresses these questions with empirical evidence from agent-based
models designed to understand these network interactions. Repeated Prisoner's
Dilemma games were designed to study how costly punishment, diversity, and
density of connectivity interact to influence cooperation in a biological
network. There are 1000 rounds in each game made up of 18 players engaged in
pairwise relationship with their neighbors. This study shows three important
interactions. (1) Introducing diversity to costly punishment favors both
cooperation and defection, but not vice versa. Introducing costly punishment to
diversity disfavors defection but favors cooperation. (2) Costly Punishment,
alone, disfavors defection but decreases average payoff. Decreasing the density
of connectivity, Dc, when there is no costly punishment applied, increases
average payoff. (3) A synergy of diversity and decreasing density of
connectivity favors cooperation in a biological network. Furthermore, this
study also suggests a likelihood from empirical findings that spatial
structures may not be favoring cooperation, as is the widely-accepted notion,
but rather disfavoring defection in the global scale.

Si(OH)$_2$ pores possess superior ion rejection rates due to selective
electrostatic repulsion of Cl$^-$ ions, but Na$^+$ ions are attracted to the
pore and block water transfer. (2) By contrast, the SiH$_2$ pores operate via a

the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a

mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time

granulation) play a key role in the Babcock-Leighton (BL) process to generate
large-scale polar fields from sunspots fields. In most surface flux transport
(SFT) and BL dynamo models, the dispersal and migration of surface fields is
modeled as an effective turbulent diffusion. Recent SFT models have
incorporated explicit, realistic convective flows in order to improve the
fidelity of convective transport but, to our knowledge, this has not yet been
implemented in previous BL models. Since most Flux-Transport (FT)/BL models are
axisymmetric, they do not have the capacity to include such flows. We present
the first kinematic 3D FT/BL model to explicitly incorporate realistic
convective flows based on solar observations. Though we describe a means to
generalize these flows to 3D, we find that the kinematic small-scale dynamo
action they produce disrupts the operation of the cyclic dynamo. Cyclic
solution is found by limiting the convective flow to act only on the vertical
radial component of the magnetic field. The results obtained are generally in
good agreement with the observed surface flux evolution and with non-convective
models that have a turbulent diffusivity on the order of $3 \times 10^{12}$
cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ (300 km$^2$ s$^{-1}$). However, we find that the use of a
turbulent diffusivity underestimates the dynamo efficiency, producing weaker
mean fields and shorter cycle than in the convective models. Also, the
convective models exhibit mixed polarity bands in the polar regions that have
no counterpart in solar observations. Also, the explicitly computed turbulent
electromotive force (emf) bears little resemblance to a diffusive flux. We also
find that the poleward migration speed of poloidal flux is determined mainly by
the meridional flow and the vertical diffusion.

(ii) explore the correlations along different dimensions; and (iii) realize
efficient parameter estimation by a proposed iterative double Flip-Flop
algorithm. We also investigate the properties of the TME model, existence and
identifiability of parameter estimation. The numerical analysis demonstrates
the efficiency and accuracy of the parameter estimation in the TME model.
Convergence and asymptotic properties are discussed in the simulation and
surrogate data analysis. The case study shows an application of the TME model
in quantifying the influence of alignment on carbon nanotubes buckypaper.
Moreover, the TME model can be applied to provide potential solutions for a
family of tensor data analytics problems with mixed effects.

builds on varying random coefficients (VRC) that are determined by nonlinear

paper proposes a novel estimator of the VRC density based on weighted sieve
minimum distance. The main example of sieve bases are Hermite functions which
yield a numerically stable estimation procedure. This paper shows inference
results that go beyond what has been shown in ordinary RC models. We provide in

in this case forbid the existence of black branes. In all these cases the field
equations acquire an invariance under a global scaling scale transformation of
the metric. As explicit examples we construct new magnetically charged black
branes for cubic Lovelock theory coupled to a Kalb-Ramond field in dimensions
$(3m+2)+q$, with $m$ and $q$ integers, and the latter denoting the number of
extended flat directions. We also construct dyonic solutions in quartic

pixel-wise retrieval in a learned embedding space: we embed pixels of the same

annotated pixels are set as reference and the rest of the pixels are classified
using a nearest-neighbor approach. The proposed method supports different kinds
of user input such as segmentation mask in the first frame (semi-supervised

semi-supervised scenario, we achieve results competitive with the state of the

interactive scenario where the user is able to refine their input iteratively,
the proposed method provides instant response to each input, and reaches
comparable quality to competing methods with much less interaction.

notations and has been playing a crucial role in describing formulae in
mathematical physics. This paper shows a programming language that can deal
with symbolical tensor indices by introducing a set of tensor index rules that
is compatible with two types of parameters, i.e., scalar and tensor parameters.
When a tensor parameter obtains a tensor as an argument, the function treats
the tensor argument as a whole. In contrast, when a scalar parameter obtains a
tensor as an argument, the function is applied to each component of the tensor.
On a language with scalar and tensor parameters, we can design a set of index
reduction rules that allows users to use tensor index notation for arbitrary
user-defined functions without requiring additional description. Furthermore,
we can also design index completion rules that allow users to define the
operators concisely for differential forms such as the wedge product, exterior
derivative, and Hodge star operator. In our proposal, all these tensor
operators are user-defined functions and can be passed as arguments of
high-order functions.

delays prior star formation episodes, the gas remains metal-free until the halo
virial temperatures $\gtrsim 2\times 10^4~{\rm K}$. The minimum cooling mass of
DM halos is boosted by a factor of $\sim 10-30$ because frequent major mergers
of halos further inhibit gas collapse. We use Monte Carlo merger trees to
simulate the DM assembly history under a streaming velocity of twice the
root-mean-square value, and estimate the number density of massive DM halos
containing pristine gas as $\simeq 10^{-4}~{\rm cMpc}^{-3}$. When the gas
infall begins, efficient Ly$\alpha$ cooling drives cold streams penetrating
inside the halo and feeding a central galactic disk. When one stream collides
with the disk, strong shock forms a dense and hot gas cloud, where the gas
never forms H$_2$ molecules due to effective collisional dissociation. As a
result, a massive gas cloud forms by gravitational instability and collapses

Almost simultaneously, a galaxy with $M_{\star, \rm tot}\sim 10^6~M_\odot$

of convective core overshooting on mass for stars more massive than 1.1-1.2
solar masses, but the adopted shapes for that relation have remained somewhat
arbitrary for lack of strong observational constraints. In previous work we
compared stellar evolution models to well-measured eclipsing binaries to show
that, when overshooting is implemented as a diffusive process, the fitted free
parameter f(ov) rises sharply up to about 2 solar masses, and remains largely
constant thereafter. Here we analyze a new sample of eight binaries selected to
be in the critical mass range below 2 solar masses where f(ov) is changing the
most, nearly doubling the number of individual stars in this regime. This
interval is important because the precise way in which f(ov) changes determines
the shape of isochrones in the turnoff region of 1-5 Gyr clusters, and can thus
affect their inferred ages. It also has a significant influence on estimates of
stellar properties for exoplanet hosts, on stellar population synthesis, and on
the detailed modeling of interior stellar structures, including the calculation
of oscillation frequencies that are observable with asteroseismic techniques.
We find that the derived f(ov) values for our new sample are consistent with
the trend defined by our earlier determinations, and strengthen the relation.
This provides an opportunity for future series of models to test the new
prescription, grounded on observations, against independent observations that
may constrain overshooting in a different way.

suspensions, based on correlations in a space representing forces, which is
dual to position space. Working with the ensemble of steady state
configurations obtained from simulations of suspensions in two dimensions, we
find that the anisotropy of the pair correlation function in force space
changes with confining shear stress ($\sigma_{xy}$) and packing fraction
($\phi$). Using these microscopic correlations, we build a statistical theory
for the macroscopic friction coefficient: the anisotropy of the stress tensor,
$\mu = \sigma_{xy}/P$. We find that $\mu$ decreases (i) as $\phi$ is increased
and (ii) as $\sigma_{xy}$ is increased. Using a new constitutive relation
between $\mu$ and viscosity for dense suspensions that generalizes the
rate-independent one, we show that our theory predicts a Discontinuous Shear
Thickening (DST) flow diagram that is in good agreement with numerical
simulations, and the qualitative features of $\mu$ that lead to the generic
flow diagram of a DST fluid observed in experiments.

degree graph. Let $k$ be the number of colors and let $d$ be the maximum
degree. In 1999, Vigoda showed that the Glauber dynamics is rapidly mixing for
any $k > \frac{11}{6} d$. It turns out that there is a natural barrier at
$\frac{11}{6}$, below which there is no one-step coupling that is contractive,
even for the flip dynamics.
  We use linear programming and duality arguments to guide our construction of
a better coupling. We fully characterize the obstructions to going beyond
$\frac{11}{6}$. These examples turn out to be quite brittle, and even starting
from one, they are likely to break apart before the flip dynamics changes the
distance between two neighboring colorings. We use this intuition to design a
variable length coupling that shows that the Glauber dynamics is rapidly mixing
for any $k\ge \left(\frac{11}{6} - \epsilon_0\right)d$ where $\epsilon_0 \geq
9.4 \cdot 10^{-5}$. This is the first improvement to Vigoda's analysis that
holds for general graphs.

plateaus remain quantized at $2e^2/h$ over large ranges of experimental control
parameters. In light of recent experiments reporting the observation of robust
$2e^2/h$-quantized conductance plateaus in local charge tunneling experiments,
we perform extensive numerical calculations to explicitly show that such
quantized conductance plateaus, which are obtained by varying control
parameters such as the tunnel barrier height, the super gate potential, and the
applied magnetic field, can arise as a result of the existence of ps-ABSs.
Because ps-ABSs can form rather generically in the topologically trivial
regime, even in the absence of disorder, our results suggest that the
observation of a robust quantized conductance plateau does not represent
sufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of non-Abelian
topologically-protected Majorana zero modes localized at the opposite ends of a

(left-hand) branch of the Paschen curve at very high voltage when electrons are
in the runaway regime and charge exchange/ionization avalanche by ions and fast
neutral atoms becomes important. The model has been applied to helium gas
between parallel-plate electrodes, at potentials ranging in magnitude between
10 and 1000 kilovolt. The respective value of reduced electric field E/n varies
in the range of 50-6000kTd, with reduced density nd (where n is the gas density
and d is the inter-electrode distance) on the order of 10^20 m^-2. For fast
neutral atoms produced via charge exchange, the following interactions prove
essential to understanding the breakdown mechanism: contribution to impact
ionization, strongly anisotropic scattering in collisions with background
atoms,and backscattering (of both atoms and ions, which become neutralized)
from the cathode. Three regimes of the breakdown have been identified according
to relative share of impact ionization by electrons, by ions, and by fast
neutrals. In the fast-neutral regime of particular interest here, the
ionization avalanche is directed from anode towards cathode. It is initiated by
the fast neutral beam backscattered from the cathode, and charge multiplication
occurs through multiple successive cycles of ionization and charge exchange.
Further, the double-valued shape of the Paschen curve with a branch point near
200 kV is found to be due to heavy species undergoing a transition to runaway
regime. The analytical Paschen curve is compared to those obtained with a
detailed Particle-In-Cell/Monte Carlo (PIC/MCC) simulation, and also to
experimental measurements. The model provides accurate predictions for E/n up
to ~ 1000 kTd, constrained by availability and quality of required input data.

carried out in a fluid following a multiparticle collision scheme where the

presence of catalytic obstacles changes the oscillatory dynamics from a limit
cycle to a fix point reached after a damping. The damping is characterized by
the decay constant, which grows linearly with volume fraction for low values of
the mesoscale collision time and the catalytic reaction constant. Additionally,
it is shown that, although the distribution of obstacles is random, there are
regions in the system where the catalytic chemical reactions are favored. This
entails that in average the radius of gyrations of catalytic chemical reaction
does not match with the radius of gyration of obstacles, that is, clusters of
reactions emerge on the catalytic obstacles, even when the diffusion is

field effect transistors, modulators and electrical transducers, providing that
research of their electrotransport and electromechanical performances can be
lifted up from mostly empirical to prognostic theoretical level.Recently we
have shown that alternating piezoelectric displacement of the ferroelectric
domain surfaces can lead to the alternate stretching and separation of graphene
areas at the steps between elongated and contracted domains, and the
conductance of graphene channel can be increased essentially at room
temperature, because electrons in the stretched section scatter on acoustic
phonons.The piezoelectric mechanism of graphene conductance control requires
systematic studies of the ambient condition impact on its manifestations. This
theoretical work studies in details the temperature behavior of the graphene
conductance changes induced by piezoelectric effect in a ferroelectric
substrate with domain stripes.We revealed the possibility to control graphene
conductance (that can change up to 100 times for PZT ferroelectric substrate)
by tuning the ambient temperature from low values to the critical one for given
gate voltage and channel length.Also we demonstrate the possibility to control
graphene conductance changes up to one hundred of times by tuning the gate
voltage from 0 to the critical value at a given temperature and channel length.
Obtained results can be open the way towards graphene on ferroelectric
applications in piezoresistive memories operating in a wide temperature range.

task in optimization that is often much more challenging than minimizing it

Frank-Wolfe (FW) or proximal gradient descent assume access to a linear or
quadratic oracle on the intersection, splitting techniques take advantage of
the structure of each sets, and only require access to the oracle on the

Augmented Lagrangian (FW-AL) algorithm, a method for minimizing a smooth
function over convex compact sets related by a ""linear consistency"" constraint
that only requires access to a linear minimization oracle over the individual
constraints. It is based on the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), also known
as Method of Multipliers, but unlike most existing splitting methods, it only
requires access to linear (instead of quadratic) minimization oracles. We use
recent advances in the analysis of Frank-Wolfe and the alternating direction
method of multipliers algorithms to prove a sublinear convergence rate for
FW-AL over general convex compact sets and a linear convergence rate for

every element of End$(\mathbb{A})$ can be written as $\alpha^\sharp\beta$ where
$\alpha,\beta\in$ End$(\mathbb{B})$, $\alpha^\sharp$ is the inverse of $\alpha$

pricing policy is published a priori, and workers then decide their task
acceptance. Such a pricing form is widely adopted in practice for its
simplicity, e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk, although additional sophistication to
pricing rule can enhance budget efficiency. With the goal of designing
efficient and simple pricing rules, we study the impact of the following two
design features in pricing policies: (i) personalization tailoring policy
worker-by-worker and (ii) bonus payment to qualified task completion. In the
Bayesian setting, where the only prior distribution of workers' profiles is
available, we first study the Price of Agnosticism (PoA) that quantifies the
utility gap between personalized and common pricing policies. We show that PoA
is bounded within a constant factor under some mild conditions, and the impact
of bonus is essential in common pricing. These analytic results imply that
complex personalized pricing can be replaced by simple common pricing once it
is equipped with a proper bonus payment. To provide insights on efficient
common pricing, we then study the efficient mechanisms of bonus payment for
several profile distribution regimes which may exist in practice. We provide
primitive experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk, which support our analytical

donor states lie above the lowest conduction band. Thus, electrons get
spontaneously ionized from donor sites (e.g., Se vacancies) without involving
the thermal activation, different from the donor ionization in conventional
semiconductors. Consequently, the resistance decreases as reducing the
temperature as observed in our measurement, which is similar to a metal but
contrasts to a usual semiconductor. Furthermore, the electron conduction
channels locate spatially away from ionized donor defects (Se vacancies) in
different van der Waals layers. Such a spatial separation can strongly suppress
the scattering caused by donor sites and subsequently increase the electron
mobility, especially at the low temperature. We call this high-mobility
mechanism self-modulation doping, i.e. the modulation doping spontaneously

of binary search that captures many problems in contextual decision-making. In
contextual search, a learner is trying to learn the value of a hidden vector $v
\in [0,1]^d$. Every round the learner is provided an adversarially-chosen
context $u_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$, submits a guess $p_t$ for the value of $\langle
u_t, v\rangle$, learns whether $p_t < \langle u_t, v\rangle$, and incurs loss
$\ell(\langle u_t, v\rangle, p_t)$ (for some loss function $\ell$). The
learner's goal is to minimize their total loss over the course of $T$ rounds.
  We present an algorithm for the contextual search problem for the symmetric
loss function $\ell(\theta, p) = |\theta - p|$ that achieves $O_{d}(1)$ total
loss. We present a new algorithm for the dynamic pricing problem (which can be
realized as a special case of the contextual search problem) that achieves
$O_{d}(\log \log T)$ total loss, improving on the previous best known upper
bounds of $O_{d}(\log T)$ and matching the known lower bounds (up to a
polynomial dependence on $d$). Both algorithms make significant use of ideas
from the field of integral geometry, most notably the notion of intrinsic
volumes of a convex set. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
application of intrinsic volumes to algorithm design.

contain samples from $P_{X,Y}$ and $P_{Y,Z}$, respectively. We argue that
causal inference can help inferring properties of the 'unobserved joint
distributions' $P_{X,Y,Z}$ or $P_{X,Z}$. The properties may be conditional
independences or also quantitative statements about dependences.
  More generally, we define a learning scenario where the input is a subset of
variables and the label is some statistical property of that subset. Sets of
jointly observed variables define the training points, while unobserved sets
are possible test points. To solve this learning task, we infer, as an
intermediate step, a causal model from the observations that then entails
properties of unobserved sets. Accordingly, we can define the VC dimension of a
class of causal models and derive generalization bounds for the predictions.
  Here, causal inference becomes more modest and better accessible to empirical
tests than usual: rather than trying to find a causal hypothesis that is 'true'
(which is a problematic term when it is unclear how to define interventions) a
causal hypothesis is useful whenever it correctly predicts statistical
properties of unobserved joint distributions.
  Within such a 'pragmatic' application of causal inference, some popular
heuristic approaches become justified in retrospect. It is, for instance,
allowed to infer DAGs from partial correlations instead of conditional
independences if the DAGs are only used to predict partial correlations.
  I hypothesize that our pragmatic view on causality may even cover the usual
meaning in terms of interventions and sketch why predicting the impact of
interventions can sometimes also be phrased as a task of the above type.

the existence of resonant transitions between the growing and decaying modes of
the cloud (analogous to Rabi oscillations in atomic physics). These resonances

Notably, the amplitude of the GW signal from the clouds may be reduced, and in
many cases terminated, much before the binary merger. The presence of a boson
cloud can also be revealed in the GW signal from the binary through the imprint
of finite-size effects, such as spin-induced multipole moments and tidal Love
numbers. The time dependence of the cloud's energy density during the resonance
leads to a sharp feature, or at least attenuation, in the contribution from the
finite-size terms to the waveforms. The observation of these effects would
constrain the properties of putative ultralight bosons through precision GW

2.70 K, which presents a superlattice structural transition at T* ~ 150 K, a
common feature for this class of compounds. However, for this material, it is
not clear that at T* the lattice distortions arise from a charge density wave
(CDW) or from a distinct microscopic origin. Interestingly, it has been
suggested in isostructural non-magnetic intermetallic compounds that T* can be
suppressed to zero temperature, by combining chemical and external pressure,
and a quantum critical point is argued to be observed near these critical
doping/pressure. Our study shows that application of pressure on
single-crystalline La3Co4Sn13 enhances Tc and decreases T*. We observe thermal
hysteresis loops for cooling/heating cycles around T* for P > 0.6 GPa, in
electrical resistivity measurements, which are not seen in x-ray diffraction
data. The hysteresis in electrical measurements may be due to the pinning of
the CDW phase to impurities/defects, while the superlattice structural
transition maintains its ambient pressure second-order transition nature under
pressure. From our experiments we estimate that T* vanishes at around 5.5 GPa,
though no quantum critical behavior is observed up to 2.53 GPa.

Surprisingly, we find that first generation stars (FG) are significantly more
centrally concentrated than extreme second generation ones (SG) out to $\sim
2.5 r_h$ from the cluster center. To understand the origin of such a peculiar
behavior, we used a set of $N$-body simulations following the long-term
dynamical evolution of LE-MPs. We find that, given the advanced dynamical state
of the cluster, the observed difference does not depend on the primordial
relative distributions of FG and SG stars. On the contrary, a difference of
$\sim 0.05-0.10 M_{\odot}$ between the average masses of the two
sub-populations is needed to account for the observed radial distributions. We
argue that such a mass difference might be the result of the higher He
abundance of SG stars (of the order of $\Delta Y\sim 0.05-0.06$) with respect
to FG. Interestingly, we find that a similar He variation is necessary to
reproduce the horizontal branch morphology of M80. These results demonstrate
that differences in mass among LE-MPs, due to different He content, should be
properly taken into account for a correct interpretation of their radial
distribution, at least in dynamically evolved systems.

that the proposed method can achieve accuracy and efficiency simultaneously.

enabled by the separation of the soliton's spectrum from the radiation's

suppression of radiation emission due to the frequency dependent linear
gain-loss. Further numerical simulations demonstrate that the enhancement of
transmission quality in waveguides with frequency dependent linear gain-loss,

falsification of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) whose dynamics follow physical
laws usually represented as differential equations. In the last two decades,
numerous reachability analysis methods and tools have been proposed for a
common class of dynamics in CPS known as ordinary differential equations (ODE).
However, there is lack of methods dealing with differential algebraic equations
(DAE) which is a more general class of dynamics that is widely used to describe
a variety of problems from engineering and science such as multibody mechanics,
electrical cicuit design, incompressible fluids, molecular dynamics and
chemcial process control. Reachability analysis for DAE systems is more complex
than ODE systems, especially for high-index DAEs because they contain both a
differential part (i.e., ODE) and algebraic constraints (AC). In this paper, we
extend the recent scalable simulation-based reachability analysis in
combination with decoupling techniques for a class of high-index large linear
DAEs. In particular, a high-index linear DAE is first decoupled into one ODE
and one or several AC subsystems based on the well-known Marz decoupling method
ultilizing admissible projectors. Then, the discrete reachable set of the DAE,
represented as a list of star-sets, is computed using simulation. Unlike ODE
reachability analysis where the initial condition is freely defined by a user,
in DAE cases, the consistency of the inititial condition is an essential
requirement to guarantee a feasible solution. Therefore, a thorough check for
the consistency is invoked before computing the discrete reachable set. Our
approach sucessfully verifies (or falsifies) a wide range of practical,
high-index linear DAE systems in which the number of state variables varies
from several to thousands.

improvements when paired with almost any base model. However, due to increased
test-time cost (for ensembles) and increased complexity of the training
pipeline (for distillation), these techniques are challenging to use in
industrial settings. In this paper we explore a variant of distillation which
is relatively straightforward to use as it does not require a complicated
multi-stage setup or many new hyperparameters. Our first claim is that online
distillation enables us to use extra parallelism to fit very large datasets
about twice as fast. Crucially, we can still speed up training even after we
have already reached the point at which additional parallelism provides no
benefit for synchronous or asynchronous stochastic gradient descent. Two neural
networks trained on disjoint subsets of the data can share knowledge by
encouraging each model to agree with the predictions the other model would have
made. These predictions can come from a stale version of the other model so
they can be safely computed using weights that only rarely get transmitted. Our
second claim is that online distillation is a cost-effective way to make the
exact predictions of a model dramatically more reproducible. We support our
claims using experiments on the Criteo Display Ad Challenge dataset, ImageNet,
and the largest to-date dataset used for neural language modeling, containing

that is defined on infinite paths, over finite traces. For example, we may need
to draw a verdict on whether the system satisfies or violates the property ""p
holds infinitely often."" The problem is that there is always a continuation of
a finite trace that satisfies the property and a different continuation that
violates it.
  We propose a two-step approach to address this problem. First, we introduce a
counting semantics that computes the number of steps to witness the
satisfaction or violation of a formula for each position in the trace. Second,
we use this information to make a prediction on inconclusive suffixes. In
particular, we consider a good suffix to be one that is shorter than the
longest witness for a satisfaction, and a bad suffix to be shorter than or
equal to the longest witness for a violation. Based on this assumption, we
provide a verdict assessing whether a continuation of the execution on the same
system will presumably satisfy or violate the property.

to eccentric discs is studied by way of a new local numerical model. Mode
coupling of tidal deformation with the disc eccentricity is known to produce
exponentially growing eccentricities at certain mean-motion resonances.
However, the details of an efficient saturation mechanism balancing this growth
still are not fully understood. This paper develops a local numerical model for
an eccentric quasi-axisymmetric shearing box which generalises the often-used
cartesian shearing box model. The numerical method is an overall second order
well-balanced finite volume method which maintains the stratified and
oscillatory steady-state solution by construction. This implementation is
employed to study the non-linear outcome of the parametric instability in
eccentric discs with vertical structure. Stratification is found to constrain
the perturbation energy near the mid-plane and localise the effective region of
inertial wave breaking that sources turbulence. A saturated marginally sonic
turbulent state results from the non-linear breaking of inertial waves and is
subsequently unstable to large-scale axisymmetric zonal flow structures. This
resulting limit-cycle behaviour reduces access to the eccentric energy source
and prevents substantial transport of angular momentum radially through the
disc. Still, the saturation of this parametric instability of inertial waves is
shown to damp eccentricity on a time-scale of a thousand orbital periods. It
may thus be a promising mechanism for intermittently regaining balance with the
exponential growth of eccentricity from the eccentric Lindblad resonances and
may also help explain the occurrence of ""bursty"" dynamics such as the superhump
phenomenon.

of sequentially observed functional data. For this purpose, procedures are
developed to segment an observed stretch of curves into periods for which
second-order stationarity may be reasonably assumed. The proposed methods are
based on measuring the fluctuations of sample eigenvalues, either individually
or jointly, and traces of the sample covariance operator computed from segments
of the data. To implement the tests, new limit results are introduced that deal
with the large-sample behavior of vector-valued processes built from partial
sample eigenvalue estimates. These results in turn enable the calibration of
the tests to a prescribed asymptotic level. A simulation study and an
application to Australian annual minimum temperature curves confirm that the
proposed methods work well in finite samples. The application suggests that the
variation in annual minimum temperature underwent a structural break in the
1950s, after which typical fluctuations from the generally increasing
trendstarted to be significantly smaller.

improve physician risk assessment. Methods: Prospective, non-randomized,
interventional pilot study of twenty perioperative physicians at a quarterly
academic medical center. Using 150 clinical cases we compared physicians' risk
assessment before and after interaction with MySurgeryRisk, a validated
machine-learning algorithm predicting preoperative risk for six major

(AUC) of MySurgeryRisk algorithm ranged between 0.73 and 0.85 and was
significantly higher than physicians' risk assessments (AUC between 0.47 and

The AUC for repeated physician's risk assessment improved by 2% to 5% for all

yet such graphs are challenging to visualize. In this paper, we introduce a
novel, scalable, tree+table multivariate graph visualization technique, which
makes many tasks related to multivariate graph analysis easier to achieve. The
core principle we follow is to selectively query for nodes or subgraphs of
interest and visualize these subgraphs as a spanning tree of the graph. The
tree is laid out linearly, which enables us to juxtapose the nodes with a table
visualization where diverse attributes can be shown. We also use this table as
an adjacency matrix, so that the resulting technique is a hybrid
node-link/adjacency matrix technique. We implement this concept in Juniper and
complement it with a set of interaction techniques that enable analysts to
dynamically grow, restructure, and aggregate the tree, as well as change the
layout or show paths between nodes. We demonstrate the utility of our tool in
usage scenarios for different multivariate networks: a bipartite network of
scholars, papers, and citation metrics and a multitype network of story

entropy in continuous time, we give a total account of information processing
in this setting, incorporating information storage. We find that a convergent
rate of predictive capacity, comprised of the transfer entropy and active
information storage, does not exist, arising through divergent rates of active
information storage. We identify that active information storage can be
decomposed into two separate quantities that characterise predictive capacity
stored in a process: active memory utilisation and instantaneous predictive
capacity. The latter involves prediction related to path regularity and so
solely inherits the divergent properties of the active information storage,
whilst the former permits definitions of pathwise and rate quantities. We
formulate measures of memory utilisation for jump and neural spiking processes
and illustrate measures of information processing in synthetic neural spiking
models and coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. The application to synthetic
neural spiking models demonstrates that active memory utilisation for point
processes consists of discontinuous jump contributions (at spikes) interrupting
a continuously varying contribution (relating to waiting times between spikes),
complementing the behaviour previously demonstrated for transfer entropy in
these processes.

function using a spectral expansion formulation known as the kernel embedding

this spectral expansion using a set of data-driven basis functions obtained
from the diffusion maps algorithm. The theoretical error estimate suggests that
the error bound of the approximate data-driven likelihood function is
independent of the variance of the basis functions, which allows us to
determine the amount of training data for accurate likelihood function
estimations. Supporting numerical results to demonstrate the robustness of the
data-driven likelihood functions for parameter estimation are given on
instructive examples involving stochastic and deterministic differential
equations. When the dimension of the data manifold is strictly less than the
dimension of the ambient space, we found that the proposed approach (which does
not require the knowledge of the data manifold) is superior compared to
likelihood functions constructed using standard parametric basis functions
defined on the ambient coordinates. In an example where the data manifold is
not smooth and unknown, the proposed method is more robust compared to an
existing polynomial chaos surrogate model which assumes a parametric

imposing a Rashba SOC between the spin states of fermions, the greatly

mean-field collapsing regime but with a negative fluctuation energy, distinct
from the interaction-induced droplets found in literature. The accessibility of

domain, usually clinical data are high-dimensional, sparse and complex and
sometimes there exists few amount of time-to-event (labeled) instances.
Therefore building an accurate survival model from electronic health records is
challenging. With this motivation, we address this issue and provide a new
survival analysis framework using deep learning and active learning with a
novel sampling strategy. First, our approach provides better representation
with lower dimensions from clinical features using labeled (time-to-event) and
unlabeled (censored) instances and then actively trains the survival model by
labeling the censored data using an oracle. As a clinical assistive tool, we
introduce a simple effective treatment recommendation approach based on our
survival model. In the experimental study, we apply our approach on
SEER-Medicare data related to prostate cancer among African-Americans and white
patients. The results indicate that our approach outperforms significantly than

a wireless virtual reality (VR) network in which unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) capture videos on live games or sceneries and transmit them to small
base stations (SBSs) that service the VR users. However, due to its limited
capacity, the wireless network may not be able to meet the delay requirements
of such 360 content transmissions. To meet the VR delay requirements, the UAVs
can extract specific visible content (e.g., user field of view) from the
original 360 data and send this visible content to the users so as to reduce
the traffic load over backhaul and radio access links. To further alleviate the
UAV-SBS backhaul traffic, the SBSs can also cache the popular contents that
users request. This joint content caching and transmission problem is
formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users'
reliability, defined as the probability that the content transmission delay of
each user satisfies the instantaneous VR delay target. To address this problem,
a distributed deep learning algorithm that brings together new neural network
ideas from liquid state machine (LSM) and echo state networks (ESNs) is
proposed. The proposed algorithm enables each SBS to predict the users'
reliability so as to find the optimal contents to cache and content
transmission format for each UAV. Analytical results are derived to expose the
various network factors that impact content caching and content transmission
format selection. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields
25.4% gain of reliability compared to Q-learning. The results also show that
the proposed algorithm can achieve 14.7% gain of reliability due to the
reduction of traffic load over backhaul compared to the proposed algorithm with
random caching.

To mitigate these limitations, we present a systematic weight pruning framework

formulate the weight pruning problem of DNNs as a nonconvex optimization
problem with combinatorial constraints specifying the sparsity requirements,
and then adopt the ADMM framework for systematic weight pruning. By using ADMM,
the original nonconvex optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems

stochastic gradient descent, the other can be solved analytically. Besides, our
method achieves a fast convergence rate.

weight reduction without accuracy loss. On the AlexNet model for the ImageNet
data set, we achieve 21 times weight reduction without accuracy loss. When we
focus on the convolutional layer pruning for computation reductions, we can
reduce the total computation by five times compared with the prior work

Device Architecture kernels and the hardware-optimized cuBLAS matrix library.
Algorithmic advances include a batched Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury algorithm to
quickly update matrix determinants and inverses, density-fitting of the
two-electron integrals, an energy algorithm involving a high-dimensional
precomputed tensor, and the use of single-precision floating point arithmetic.
These strategies result in dramatic reductions in wall-times for both single-

speed-ups of roughly two orders of magnitude using just a single GPU card.
Furthermore, we achieve near-unity parallel efficiency using 8 GPU cards on a
single node, and can reach moderate system sizes via a local memory-slicing
approach. We illustrate the robustness of our implementation on hydrogen chains
of increasing length, and through the calculation of all-electron ionization
potentials of the first-row transition metal atoms. We compare long
imaginary-time calculations utilizing a population control algorithm with our
previously published correlated sampling approach, and show that the latter
improves not only the efficiency but also the accuracy of the computed
ionization potentials. Taken together, the GPU implementation combined with
correlated sampling provides a compelling computational method that will

the effect of different, especially higher, ion beam fluences on ion stopping

To address this question, a Thomson parabola was built for the Neutralized
Drift Compression eXperiment (NDCX-II) for ion energy-loss measurements at
different ion beam fluences. The linear induction accelerator NDCX-II delivers
2 ns short, intense ion pulses, up to several tens of nC/pulse, or
10$^{10}$-10$^{11}$ ions, with a peak kinetic energy of ~1.1 MeV and a minimal
spot size of 2 mm FWHM. For this particular accelerator the energy
determination with conventional beam diagnostics, for example, time of flight
measurements, is imprecise due to the non-trivial longitudinal phase space of
the beam. In contrast, a Thomson parabola is well suited to reliably determine
the beam energy distribution. The Thomson parabola differentiates charged
particles by energy and charge-to-mass ratio, through deflection of charged
particles by electric and magnetic fields. During first proof-of-principle
experiments, we achieved to reproduce the average initial helium beam energy as
predicted by computer simulations with a deviation of only 1.4 %. Successful
energy-loss measurements with 1 {\mu}m thick Silicon Nitride foils show the
suitability of the accelerator for such experiments. The initial ion energy was
determined during a primary measurement without a target, while a second
measurement, incorporating the target, was used to determine the transmitted
energy. The energy-loss was then determined as the difference between the two
energies.

transitions and message passing each satisfy a local commutativity condition.
This paper is a continuation of the abelian networks series of Bond and Levine
(2016), for which we extend the theory of abelian networks that halt on all
inputs to networks that can run forever. A nonhalting abelian network can be
realized as a discrete dynamical system in many different ways, depending on
the update order. We show that certain features of the dynamics, such as
minimal period length, have intrinsic definitions that do not require
specifying an update order.
  We give an intrinsic definition of the \emph{torsion group} of a finite
irreducible (halting or nonhalting) abelian network, and show that it coincides
with the critical group of Bond and Levine (2016) if the network is halting. We
show that the torsion group acts freely on the set of invertible recurrent
components of the trajectory digraph, and identify when this action is
transitive.
  This perspective leads to new results even in the classical case of sinkless
rotor networks (deterministic analogues of random walks). In Holroyd et. al
(2008) it was shown that the recurrent configurations of a sinkless rotor
network with just one chip are precisely the unicycles (spanning subgraphs with
a unique oriented cycle, with the chip on the cycle). We generalize this result
to abelian mobile agent networks with any number of chips. We give formulas for
generating series such as \[ \sum_{n \geq 1} r_n z^n = \det (\frac{1}{1-z}D - A
) \] where $r_n$ is the number of recurrent chip-and-rotor configurations with
$n$ chips; $D$ is the diagonal matrix of outdegrees, and $A$ is the adjacency
matrix. A consequence is that the sequence $(r_n)_{n \geq 1}$ completely
determines the spectrum of the simple random walk on the network.

a traditional macroscopic hydrodynamic model based on continuity hypothesis and
conservation laws. In this study, the two models are compared from two aspects,
physical capability and computational cost, by simulating two kinds of flow
problems including the thermal Couette flow and a Mach 3 step problem. In the
cases where the TNE effects are weak, both the two models give accurate results
for the hydrodynamic behaviour. Besides, DBM can provide more detailed
non-equilibrium information, while the NS is more efficient if concern only the

the GeV emission in the region using data from the \emph{Fermi} LAT is
presented. The GeV emission has an extended morphology in the region of the TeV
emission and the overall spectrum can be accounted for by a cosmic ray
population having a simple power-law spectrum with energies extending up to 1
PeV. However, the spectrum at tens of TeV should be observed more deeply in the
future to confirm its hadronic nature, and other scenarios involving
combinations of leptonic and hadronic emission from several of the known
supernova remnants in the region cannot be ruled out. The nearby TeV source
HESS J1813-178, thought to be a PWN, is also studied in detail at GeV energies
and we find a region of significant emission which is much more extended than
the TeV emission and whose spectrum is softer than expected from a PWN but
similar to those seen in several star forming regions that are believed to
accelerate protons. There is marginal evidence for a GeV point source at the

expected around most, if not all, galaxies. Although these features may provide
useful diagnostics of the $\Lambda$CDM model, their observational properties
remain poorly constrained because they are challenging to detect and interpret
and have been studied in detail for only a sparse sampling of galaxy
population. More quantitative, systematic approaches are required. We advocate
statistical analysis of the counts and properties of such features in archival
wide-field imaging surveys for a direct comparison against results from
numerical simulations. Thus, in this paper we aim to study systematically the
frequency of occurrence and other observational properties of tidal features
around nearby galaxies. The sample we construct will act as a foundational
dataset for statistical comparison with cosmological models of galaxy
formation. Our approach is based on a visual classification of diffuse features
around a volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies, using a post-processing of
Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging optimized for the detection of stellar
structure with low surface brightness. At a limiting surface brightness of $28\
\mathrm{mag~arcsec^{-2}}$, 14% of the galaxies in our sample exhibit evidence
of diffuse features likely to have arisen from minor merging events. Our
technique recovers all previously known streams in our sample and yields a
number of new candidates. Consistent with previous studies, coherent arc-like
features and shells are the most common type of tidal structures found in this
study. We conclude that although some detections are ambiguous and could be
corroborated or refuted with deeper imaging, our technique provides a reliable
foundation for the statistical analysis of diffuse circumgalactic features in
wide-area imaging surveys, and for the identification of targets for follow-up
studies.

These results rely on Yang-Baxter integrability and are valid in Regime III for

that the one-dimensional sums produce new finitized Virasoro characters

further conjecture finitized bosonic forms and check that these agree with the
ground state one-dimensional sums out to system sizes $N=12$. The $2\times 2$

methods is that they adapt a single step-size shared by all the weights of the

parameters on a per-feature basis. Furthermore, adapting parameters at
different rates has the added benefit of being a simple form of representation
learning. We generalize Incremental Delta Bar Delta (IDBD)---a vectorized

dependence on observational parameters, e.g., the surface brightness limit
(SBL), the effects of cosmological redshift dimming, point spread function and
CCD pixel size. Detailed analyses suggest that the width of point spread
function has a significant effect on the measured ICL fraction, while the
relatively small pixel size shows almost no influence. It is found that the
measured ICL fraction depends strongly on the SBL. At a fixed SBL and redshift,
the measured ICL fraction decreases with increasing halo mass, while with a
much faint SBL, it does not depend on halo mass at low redshifts. In our work,
the measured ICL fraction shows clear dependence on the cosmological redshift
dimming effect. It is found that there are more mass locked in ICL component
than light, suggesting that the use of a constant mass-to-light ratio at high
surface brightness levels will lead to an underestimate of ICL mass.
Furthermore, it is found that the radial profile of ICL shows a characteristic
radius which is almost independent of halo mass. The current measurement of ICL
from observations has a large dispersion due to different methods, and we
emphasize the importance of using the same definition when observational

asymmetric mass-splits. Without quantum shells, which can give extra binding
energy to these mass-asymmetric shapes, the nuclei would fission symmetrically.
The strongest shell effects are in spherical nuclei, so naturally the spherical
""doubly-magic"" ${^{132}}$Sn nucleus (${Z=50}$ protons), was expected to play a
major role. However, a systematic study of fission has shown that the heavy
fragments are distributed around ${Z=52}$ to 56, indicating that ${^{132}}$Sn
is not the only driver. Reconciling the strong spherical shell effects at
${Z=50}$ with the different ${Z}$ values of fission fragments observed in
nature has been a longstanding puzzle. Here, we show that the final mass
asymmetry of the fragments is also determined by the extra stability of
octupole (pear-shaped) deformations which have been recently confirmed
experimentally around $^{144}$Ba (${Z=56}$), one of very few nuclei with
shell-stabilized octupole deformation. Using a modern quantum many-body model
of superfluid fission dynamics, we found that heavy fission fragments are
produced predominantly with ${52-56}$ protons, associated with significant
octupole deformation acquired on the way to fission. These octupole shapes
favouring asymmetric fission are induced by deformed shells at ${Z=52}$ and 56.
In contrast, spherical ""magic"" nuclei are very resistant to octupole
deformation, which hinders their production as fission fragments. These

attempt to directly map an input image (or a random vector) to an image in one

Inspired by recent work on module networks, this paper proposes ModularGAN for
multi-domain image generation and image-to-image translation. ModularGAN
consists of several reusable and composable modules that carry on different
functions (e.g., encoding, decoding, transformations). These modules can be
trained simultaneously, leveraging data from all domains, and then combined to
construct specific GAN networks at test time, according to the specific image
translation task. This leads to ModularGAN's superior flexibility of generating

Therefore, we use a non-parametric change-point detection algorithm, which has
linear computational complexity in the number of messages, to divide the

sequence of weak measurements corresponding to a stochastic process. However,
the weak measurements may require almost arbitrary unitaries, which are
unlikely to be realized by any real measurement device. Furthermore, many
measurement processes are destructive, like photon counting procedures that
terminate once all photons are consumed. One cannot expect to have full control
of the evolution of a state under such destructive measurements, and the
possible unitaries allow only a limited set of weak measurements. In this
paper, we consider a qubit model of destructive weak measurements, which is a
toy version of an optical cavity, in which the state of an electromagnetic
field mode inside the cavity leaks out and is measured destructively while the
vacuum state |0> leaks in to the cavity. At long times, the state of the qubit
inevitably evolves to be |0>, and the only available control is the choice of
measurement on the external ancilla system. Surprisingly, this very limited
model can still perform an arbitrary projective measurement on the qubit in any
basis, where the probability of getting an outcome satisfies the usual Born
rule. Combining this method with probabilistic post processing, the result can
be extended to any generalized measurement with commuting POVM elements. This
implies, among other results, that any two-outcome POVM on a qubit can be
decomposed into a sequence of destructive weak measurements by this restricted
measurement device.

the low-resolution image. We focus on transferring the high-resolution texture
from reference images to the super-resolution process without the constraint of

difference from previous example-based methods. Inspired by recent work on
image stylization, we address the problem via neural texture transfer. We
design an end-to-end trainable deep model which generates detail enriched
results by adaptively fusing the content from the low-resolution image with the
texture patterns from the reference image. We create a benchmark dataset for
the general research of reference-based super-resolution, which contains
reference images paired with low-resolution inputs with varying degrees of
similarity. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the great
potential of using reference images as well as the superiority of our results

removes image blur with a given blur kernel, which is essential but difficult
due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. The predominant approach is
based on optimization subject to regularization functions that are either
manually designed, or learned from examples. Existing learning based methods
have shown superior restoration quality but are not practical enough due to
their restricted and static model design. They solely focus on learning a prior
and require to know the noise level for deconvolution. We address the gap
between the optimization-based and learning-based approaches by learning a
universal gradient descent optimizer. We propose a Recurrent Gradient Descent
Network (RGDN) by systematically incorporating deep neural networks into a
fully parameterized gradient descent scheme. A hyper-parameter-free update unit
shared across steps is used to generate updates from the current estimates,
based on a convolutional neural network. By training on diverse examples, the
Recurrent Gradient Descent Network learns an implicit image prior and a
universal update rule through recursive supervision. The learned optimizer can
be repeatedly used to improve the quality of diverse degenerated observations.
The proposed method possesses strong interpretability and high generalization.
Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and challenging real-world images
demonstrate that the proposed deep optimization method is effective and robust
to produce favorable results as well as practical for real-world image
deblurring applications.

distance localization of a sound source in a three-dimensional (3D) space using
only the interaural time difference (ITD) cue, generated by a newly-developed
self-rotational bi-microphone robotic platform. The system dynamics is
established in the spherical coordinate frame using a state-space model. The
observability analysis of the state-space model shows that the system is
unobservable when the sound source is placed with elevation angles of $90$ and
$0$ degree. The proposed method utilizes the difference between the azimuth
estimates resulting from respectively the 3D and the two-dimensional models to
check the zero-degree-elevation condition and further estimates the elevation
angle using a polynomial curve fitting approach. Also, the proposed method is
capable of detecting a $90$-degree elevation by extracting the zero-ITD signal
'buried' in noise. Additionally, a distance localization is performed by first
rotating the microphone array to face toward the sound source and then shifting
the microphone perpendicular to the source-robot vector by a predefined
distance of a fixed number of steps. The integrated rotational and
translational motions of the microphone array provide a complete orientation
and distance localization using only the ITD cue. A novel robotic platform
using a self-rotational bi-microphone array was also developed for unmanned
ground robots performing sound source localization. The proposed technique was
first tested in simulation and was then verified on the newly-developed robotic
platform. Experimental data collected by the microphones installed on a KEMAR
dummy head were also used to test the proposed technique. All results show the
effectiveness of the proposed technique.

memory accesses. Previous prevention methods are mainly based on software
checking associated with performance overhead, while traditional hardware
protection mechanisms only work for inter-process memory accesses. In this
paper we propose a novel hardware based in-process isolation system called PULP
(Protection by User Level Partition). PULP modifies processor core by
associating program counter and virtual memory address to achieve in-process
data isolation. PULP partitions the program into two distinct parts, one is
reliable, called primary functions, and the other is unreliable, called
secondary functions, the accessible memory range of which can be configured via
APIs. PULP automatically checks the memory bound when executing load/store
operations in secondary functions. A RISC-V based FPGA prototype is
implementated and functional test shows that PULP can effectively prevent
in-process bug, including the Heartbleed and other buffer overflow
vulnerabilities, etc. The total runtime overhead of PULP is negligible, as
there is no extra runtime overhead besides configuring the API. We run SPEC2006
to evaluate the average performance, considering the LIBC functions as
secondary functions. Experimental timing results show that, running bzip2, mcf,
and libquantum, PULP bears low runtime overhead (less than 0.1%). Analysis also
shows that PULP can be used effectively to prevent the newest ""Spectre"" bug
which threats nearly all out-of-order processors.

of a compact star provides a brief but intense display of stellar nuclear
processes. For neutron stars accreting from a binary companion, these events
manifest as thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts, and recur on typical
timescales of hours to days. We measured the burst rate as a function of
accretion rate, from seven neutron stars with known spin rates, using a burst
sample accumulated over several decades. At the highest accretion rates, the
burst rate is lower for faster spinning stars. The observations imply that fast
(> 400 Hz) rotation encourages stabilization of nuclear burning, suggesting a
dynamical dependence of nuclear ignition on the spin rate. This dependence is
unexpected, because faster rotation entails less shear between the surrounding
accretion disk and the star. Large-scale circulation in the fuel layer, leading
to enhanced mixing of the burst ashes into the fuel layer, may explain this
behavior; further numerical simulations are required to confirm.

alkali-earth (like) atoms in the electronic $^{1}{\rm S}_{0}$ state ($g$-state)

quantum simulation of Kondo effect. We study the control of this spin-exchange
interaction for two atoms simultaneously confined in a quasi-one-dimensional
(quasi-1D) tube, where the $g$-atom is freely moving in the axial direction
while the $e$-atom is further localized by an additional axial trap and behaves
as a quasi-zero-dimensional (quasi-0D) impurity. In this system, the two atoms
experience effective-1D spin-exchange interactions in both even and odd partial
wave channels, whose intensities can be controlled by the characteristic
lengths of the confinements via the confinement-induced-resonances (CIRs). In
current work, we go beyond that pure-1D approximation. We model the transverse
and axial confinements by harmonic traps with finite characteristic lengths
$a_\perp$ and $a_z$, respectively, and exactly solve the ""quasi-1D + quasi-0D""
scattering problem between these two atoms. Using the solutions we derive the
effective 1D spin-exchange interaction and investigate the locations and widths
of the even/odd wave CIRs for our system.
  It is found that when the ratio $a_z/a_\perp$ is larger, the CIRs can be
induced by weaker confinements, which are easier to be realized experimentally.
  The comparison between our results and the recent experiment shows that the
two experimentally observed resonance branches of the spin-exchange effect are
due to an even-wave CIR and an odd-wave CIR, respectively. Our results are
advantageous for the control and description of either the effective
spin-exchange interaction or other types of interactions between ultracold
atoms in quasi 1+0 dimensional systems.

difficult to provide in the desired quantity, realism, density, and accuracy.
To address this issue, we develop a method to learn representations, which are
very specific for articulated poses, without the need for labeled training
data. We exploit the observation that the object pose of a known object is
predictive for the appearance in any known view. That is, given only the pose
and shape parameters of a hand, the hand's appearance from any viewpoint can be
approximated. To exploit this observation, we train a model that -- given input
from one view -- estimates a latent representation, which is trained to be
predictive for the appearance of the object when captured from another
viewpoint. Thus, the only necessary supervision is the second view. The
training process of this model reveals an implicit pose representation in the
latent space. Importantly, at test time the pose representation can be inferred
using only a single view. In qualitative and quantitative experiments we show
that the learned representations capture detailed pose information. Moreover,
when training the proposed method jointly with labeled and unlabeled data, it
consistently surpasses the performance of its fully supervised counterpart,
while reducing the amount of needed labeled samples by at least one order of
magnitude.

are used to derive formulas for the spatial distribution of superfluidity. The
local formulation is shown to subsume several descriptions of superfluidity,
from Landau's free quasiparticle picture of the normal fluid to the fully
microscopic winding number formula for superfluid density. We derive the
superfluid distribution of generic pure states of 1-d bosonic systems by using
the continuum analog of matrix product states. With a view toward spatially
structured superfluid-based quantum devices, we consider the limits to local
distillation of superfluidity within the framework of localized resource
theories of quantum coherence.

a double quantum dot (DQD) system under a temperature bias. The DQD can be
realized by molecules such as suspended carbon nanotube and be described by the
Anderson-Holstein model in presence of electron-phonon interaction. Strong
electron-phonon interaction can lead to formation of polaronic states in which
electronic states are dressed by phonon cloud. Dressed tunneling approximation
(DTA), which is nonperturbative in dealing with strong electron-phonon
interaction, is employed to obtain the heat current expression. In DTA,
self-energies are dressed by phonon cloud operator and are temperature
dependent. The temperature dependency of imaginary part of dressed retarded
self-energy gives rise to the asymmetry of the system and is the necessary
condition of thermal rectification. On top of this, one can either tune DQD
effective energy levels such that $|\bar{\epsilon}_1|\neq |\bar{\epsilon}_2|$
or have asymmetric dot-lead couplings to achieve thermal rectification. We
numerically find that increasing electron-phonon coupling and reducing inter
dot coupling can both improve thermal rectification effect, while the

application, we classify all graded holonomic $D$-modules on a monomial curve

line, when $D$ is the first Weyl algebra. Finally, we show that the iterated
extensions are completely determined by the noncommutative deformations of its
simple factors. This tells us precisely what we can learn about a length
category by studying its species; it gives the tangent space of the
noncommutative deformation functor, or the infinitesimal deformations, but not

  Results: We present an open-source toolbox that allows for the creation of

scripts are written in Matlab/Octave and provide a command-based interface as
well as a graphical interface to construct, visualize and export models.
Built-in software modules provide functionalities such as automatic scaling of
models based on subject height and weight, custom scaling of segment lengths,
mass and inertia, addition of body landmarks, and addition of motion capture
markers. Users can set up custom definitions of joints, segments and other body
properties using the many included examples as templates. In addition to the
human, any number of objects (e.g. exoskeletons, orthoses, prostheses, boxes)
can be added to the modeling environment.
  Conclusions: The ModelFactory toolbox is published as open-source software
under the permissive zLib license. The toolbox fulfills an important function
by making it easier to create human models, and should be of interest to human

They can be stretched out in time using weak measurements, whereby one can
observe the evolution of a quantum state as it heads towards one of the
eigenstates of the measured operator. This evolution can be understood as a
continuous nonlinear stochastic process, generating an ensemble of quantum
trajectories, consisting of noisy fluctuations on top of geodesics that attract
the quantum state towards the measured operator eigenstates. The rate of
evolution is specific to each system-apparatus pair, and the Born rule
constraint requires the magnitudes of the noise and the attraction to be
precisely related. We experimentally observe the entire quantum trajectory
distribution for weak measurements of a superconducting qubit in circuit QED
architecture, quantify it, and demonstrate that it agrees very well with the
predictions of a single-parameter white-noise stochastic process. This
characterisation of quantum trajectories is a powerful clue to unraveling the
dynamics of quantum measurement, beyond the conventional axiomatic quantum
theory.

Universe. To perform such measurements the luminosity and cosmological redshift
($z$) of the SNe Ia have to be determined. The uncertainty on $z$ includes an
unknown peculiar velocity, which can be very large for SNe Ia in the virialized
cores of massive clusters. We determine which SNe Ia exploded in galaxy
clusters. We then study how the correction for peculiar velocities of host
galaxies inside the clusters improves the Hubble residuals. Using 145 SNe Ia
from the Nearby Supernova Factory we found 11 candidates for membership in
clusters. To estimate the redshift of a cluster we applied the bi-weight
technique. Then, we use the galaxy cluster redshift instead of the host galaxy
redshift to construct the Hubble diagram. For SNe Ia inside galaxy clusters the
dispersion around the Hubble diagram when peculiar velocities are taken into
account is smaller in comparison with a case without peculiar velocity
correction, with a $wRMS=0.130\pm0.038$ mag instead of $wRMS=0.137\pm0.036$
mag. The significance of this improvement is 3.58 $\sigma$. If we remove the
very nearby Virgo cluster member SN2006X ($z<0.01$) from the analysis, the
significance decreases to 1.34 $\sigma$. The peculiar velocity correction is
found to be highest for the SNe Ia hosted by blue spiral galaxies, with high
local specific star formation rate and smaller stellar mass, seemingly counter
to what might be expected given the heavy concentration of old, massive
elliptical galaxies in clusters. As expected, the Hubble residuals of SNe Ia
associated with massive galaxy clusters improve when the cluster redshift is
taken as the cosmological redshift of the SN. This fact has to be taken into
account in future cosmological analyses in order to achieve higher accuracy for
cosmological redshift measurements. Here we provide an approach to do so.

population changed dramatically. Thanks to RXTE, we discovered that neutron
stars in LMXBs spins at 200-750 Hz frequencies, and indirectly confirmed the
recycling scenario, according to which neutron stars are spun up to ms periods
during the LMXB-phase. In the meantime, the continuous discovery of
rotation-powered MSPs in binary systems in the radio and gamma-ray band (mainly
with the Fermi LAT) allowed us to classify these sources into two ""spiders""
populations, depending on the mass of their companion stars: Black Widow, with
very low-mass companion stars, and Redbacks, with larger companions possibly
filling their Roche lobes but without accretion. It was soon regained that MSPs
in short orbital period LMXBs are the progenitors of the spider populations of
rotation-powered MSPs, although a direct link between accretion- and
rotation-powered MSPs was still missing. In 2013 XMM-Newton spotted the X-ray
outburst of a new accreting MSP (IGR J18245-2452) in a source that was
previously classified as a radio MSP. Follow up observations of the source when
it went back to X-ray quiescence showed that it was able to swing between
accretion- to rotation-powered pulsations in a relatively short timescale (few
days), promoting this source as the direct link between the LMXB and the radio
MSP phases. Following discoveries showed that there exists a bunch of sources,
which alternates X-ray activity phases, showing X-ray pulsations, to radio-loud
phases, showing radio pulsations, establishing a new class of MSPs: the
Transitional MSP. In this review we describe these exciting discoveries and the
properties of accreting and transitional MSPs, highlighting what we know and
what we have still to learn about in order to fully understand the (sometime
puzzling) behavior of these systems and their evolutive connection (abridged).

as a powerful framework for conversation modeling. However, they suffer from
the notorious degeneration problem, where the decoders learn to ignore latent
variables and reduce to vanilla RNNs. We empirically show that this degeneracy
occurs mostly due to two reasons. First, the expressive power of hierarchical
RNN decoders is often high enough to model the data using only its decoding
distributions without relying on the latent variables. Second, the conditional
VAE structure whose generation process is conditioned on a context, makes the
range of training targets very sparse; that is, the RNN decoders can easily
overfit to the training data ignoring the latent variables. To solve the
degeneration problem, we propose a novel model named Variational Hierarchical
Conversation RNNs (VHCR), involving two key ideas of (1) using a hierarchical
structure of latent variables, and (2) exploiting an utterance drop
regularization. With evaluations on two datasets of Cornell Movie Dialog and
Ubuntu Dialog Corpus, we show that our VHCR successfully utilizes latent

Moreover, it can perform several new utterance control tasks, thanks to its

boundary $(M,g)$. The latter is diffeomorphic to any, constant time
hypersurface of the underlying background. In turn, assuming that $(M,g)$ is of

from the domain of the adjoint of the elliptic operator into an auxiliary

Self-adjoint extensions of the underlying elliptic operator are in one-to-one
correspondence with self-adjoint operators $\Theta$ on $\mathsf{h}$. On the one

be interpreted as the assignment of a boundary condition for the original wave

a dedicated scalable interconnect system, and SWA/AW simulations are included

computation features available on the execution platforms. The simulation
stresses the networking component when the neural net - composed by a
relatively low number of neurons, each one projecting thousands of synapses -
is distributed over a large number of hardware cores. When growing the number
of neurons per core, the computation starts to be the dominating component for
short range connections. This paper reports about preliminary performance

the ExaNeSt project. Furthermore, a comparison is given of instantaneous power,
total energy consumption, execution time and energetic cost per synaptic event

class EOPL of all problems that can be reduced to it in polynomial time. This
class captures problems that admit a single combinatorial proof of their joint
membership in the complexity classes PPAD of fixpoint problems and PLS of local
search problems. EOPL is a combinatorially-defined alternative to the class CLS
(for Continuous Local Search), which was introduced in with the goal of
capturing the complexity of some well-known problems in PPAD $\cap$ PLS that
have resisted, in some cases for decades, attempts to put them in polynomial
time. Two of these are Contraction, the problem of finding a fixpoint of a
contraction map, and P-LCP, the problem of solving a P-matrix Linear
Complementarity Problem.
  We show that EndOfPotentialLine is in CLS via a two-way reduction to
EndOfMeteredLine. The latter was defined in to show query and cryptographic
lower bounds for CLS. Our two main results are to show that both PL-Contraction
(Piecewise-Linear Contraction) and P-LCP are in EOPL. Our reductions imply that
the promise versions of PL-Contraction and P-LCP are in the promise class
UniqueEOPL, which corresponds to the case of a single potential line. This also
shows that simple-stochastic, discounted, mean-payoff, and parity games are in
EOPL.
  Using the insights from our reduction for PL-Contraction, we obtain the first
polynomial-time algorithms for finding fixed points of contraction maps in
fixed dimension for any $\ell_p$ norm, where previously such algorithms were
only known for the $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ norms. Our reduction from P-LCP

gives the fastest-known randomized algorithm for the P-LCP.

limit-sure winning, which requires the condition is satisfied with probability
arbitrarily close to~1. We study the combination of these criteria for parity
conditions, e.g., there are two parity conditions one of which must be won

Berthon et.~al for MDPs with combination of sure and almost-sure winning, under
infinite-memory strategies, and the problem has been established to be in NP

infinite-memory strategies. Our main results for combination of sure and

finite-memory strategies the problem lie in NP $\cap$ coNP; (b)~we show that
for turn-based stochastic games the problem is coNP-complete, both for

results in the literature. Thus we present a complete picture for the study of

coverability with no further specifications, where we have to show that the
nondeterminism of the produced system is sufficient to produce all the words
required in the output language. We show a counting argument on a deterministic
automaton representing the language to be covered that allows to produce such a
system. We then turn to the case of coverability with additional specification
and give a precondition for the existence of a system that produces all

additional correctness criterion. We combine our counting argument on the
deterministic automaton for the language to be covered with a ranking on the

  One of the major issues with practical realizability is the interaction
between environment assumptions and system guarantees. In many cases, synthesis
produces systems that are vacuous and concentrate on forcing the environment to
falsify its assumptions instead of fulfilling their guarantees. Coverability
offers an alternative approach to tackle this problem.

analyze different mountain ranges by means of a network approach and grasp some
essential features of the ridge branching structure. We also employ a fractal
analysis as it is especially suitable for describing properties of rough
objects and surfaces. As our approach differs from typical analyses that are
carried out in geophysics, we believe that it can initialize a research
direction that will allow to shed more light on the processes that are
responsible for landscape formation and will contribute to the network theory
by indicating a need for the construction of new models of the network growth
as no existing model can properly describe the ridge formation. We also believe
that certain features of our study can offer help in the cartographic
generalization. Specifically, we study structure of the ridge networks based on
the empirical elevation data collected by SRTM. We consider mountain ranges
from different geological periods and geographical locations. For each mountain
range, we construct a simple topographic network representation (the ridge
junctions are nodes) and a ridge representation (the ridges are nodes and the
junctions are edges) and calculate the parameters characterizing their
topology. We observe that the topographic networks inherit the fractal
structure of the mountain ranges but do not show any other complex features. In
contrast, the ridge networks, while lacking the proper fractality, reveal the
power-law degree distributions with the exponent $1.6\le \beta \le 1.7$. By
taking into account the fact that the analyzed mountains differ in many
properties, these values seem to be universal for the earthly mountainous

  myth?","50 pages; 14 figures","Diffusion Foundations (2018)",,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High entropy alloys (HEAs) are considered as a novel class of materials with
a large number of components available in nearly equatomic proportions. One of
the characteristic properties of HEAs was believed to be so-called ""sluggish""
diffusion. The faith on this myth instead of rigorous experimental analysis
played such a dominant role that the first set of data on interdiffusion, in
fact based on an improper analysis, were cited in hundreds of articles to state
the presence of sluggishness of diffusion rates in high entropy alloys. In this
review, the recent data on atomic diffusion in HEAs are critically discussed.
The discussion is focused on tracer diffusion which is already measured
dominantly for polycrystalline, but in some cases for single crystalline
high-entropy alloys. Alternatively, a rigorous analysis of the interdiffuson
experiments, which provide the diffusion rates of chemical species, too,
becomes more and more sophisticated for three and more elements in an alloy and
it is challenging to derive physically sound quantities from a general
multicomponent diffusion experiment. Most promising in this case is the
diffusion couple technique, especially the so-called pseudo-binary approach.
This approach is analyzed with a focus on the applicability and the possible
errors induced if up-hill diffusion appears. It is shown that atomic diffusion
in HEAs cannot a priori be considered as sluggish and both atomic interactions
as well as correlation effects are responsible for the observed trends. Even if
estimated on the same homologous scale, the diffusion retardation induced by a
""high entropy"" in FCC crystals is not simply proportional to the number of
alloying components and it is shown to be similar to that induced by the L12
ordering in a binary system. Furthermore, the importance of cross-correlations
in diffusion of different species in HEAs is highlighted.

are found at frequencies (2.77$\pm$0.11) and (6.42$\pm$0.18)~cycles/day,
corresponding to (8.67$\pm$0.34)~h and (3.74$\pm$0.11)~h, respectively. The
phased data show that the lightcurve does not repeat in a simple manner, but
approximately shows a double minimum at 2.77~cycles/day and a single minimum at
6.42~cycles/day. This is characteristic of an excited spin state. `Oumuamua
could be spinning in either the long (LAM) or short (SAM) axis mode. For both,
the long axis precesses around the total angular momentum vector with an
average period of (8.67$\pm$0.34)~h. For the three LAMs we have found, the
possible rotation periods around the long axis are 6.58, 13.15, or 54.48~h,
with 54.48~h being the most likely. `Oumuamua may also be nutating with
respective periods of half of these values. We have also found two possible SAM
states where `Oumuamua oscillates around the long axis with possible periods at
13.15 and 54.48~h, the latter as the most likely. In this case any nutation
will occur with the same periods. Determination of the spin state, the
amplitude of the nutation, the direction of the TAMV, and the average total
spin period may be possible with a direct model fit to the lightcurve. We find
that `Oumuamua is ""cigar-shaped""', if close to its lowest rotational energy,
and an extremely oblate spheroid if close to its highest energy state for its
total angular momentum.

connectivity involves a massive number of machine-type connections. But in a
typical application, only a small (unknown) subset of devices are active at any

connectivity is to detect the active devices first and then to decode their
data with low latency. This article outlines several key signal processing
techniques that are applicable to the problem of massive IoT access, focusing
primarily on advanced compressed sensing technique and its application for
efficient detection of the active devices. We show that massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) is especially well-suited for massive IoT connectivity
in the sense that the device detection error can be driven to zero
asymptotically in the limit as the number of antennas at the base station goes
to infinity by using the multiple-measurement vector (MMV) compressed sensing
techniques. The paper also provides a perspective on several related important
techniques for massive access, such as embedding of short messages onto the
device activity detection process and the coded random access.

MCMC-based analysis of the RV time series, inclusive of Gaussian Process (GP)
approach to the description of stellar activity induced RV variations.
  Our analysis confirms the Keplerian nature and refines the orbital solution
for the 11.44-day period super Earth, Gl15A\,b, reducing its amplitude to
$1.68^{+0.17}_{-0.18}$ m s$^{-1}$ ($M \sin i = 3.03^{+0.46}_{-0.44}$

dataset in terms of a Keplerian orbit with a period around 7600 days and an

  We also discuss the present orbital configuration of Gl15A planetary system

wide-separation companion Gl15B in a suite of detailed numerical simulations.
In order to improve the results of the dynamical analysis, we derive a new
orbital solution for the binary system, combining our RV measurements with
astrometric data from the WDS catalogue.
  The eccentric Lidov-Kozai analysis shows the strong influence of Gl15B on the
Gl15A planetary system, which can produce orbits compatible with the observed
configuration for initial inclinations of the planetary system between
$75^\circ$ and $90^\circ$, and can also enhance the eccentricity of the outer
planet well above the observed value, even resulting in orbital instability,
for inclinations around $0^\circ$ and $15^\circ - 30^\circ$.

fluids is a key problem in the study of confined fluids thermodynamics. To this
day several methods have been proposed, however there is still need for a
robust technique, capable of obtaining accurate estimates at large average
densities. A widely established technique is the Widom insertion method, that
computes the chemical potential by sampling the energy of insertion of a test
particle. Non-homogeneity is accounted for by assigning a density dependent
weight to the insertion points. However, in dense systems, the poor sampling of
the insertion energy is a source of inefficiency, hampering a reliable
convergence.
  We have recently presented a new technique for the chemical potential
calculation in homogeneous fluids. This novel method enhances the sampling of
the insertion energy via Well-Tempered Metadynamics, reaching accurate
estimates at very large densities. In this paper we extend the technique to the
case of non-homogeneous fluids. The method is successfully tested on a confined
Lennard-Jones fluid. In particular we show that, thanks to the improved
sampling, our technique does not suffer from a systematic error that affects
the classic Widom method for non-homogeneous fluids, providing a precise and
accurate result.

presence of this species in comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko, it has been shown
that the radiolysis of ice grains precursors of comets is a viable mechanism in
low-density environments, such as molecular clouds. Here, we investigate the
alternative possibility that the icy grains present in the midplane of the
protosolar nebula were irradiated during their vertical transport between the
midplane and the upper layers over a large number of cycles, as a result of
turbulent mixing. Consequently, these grains spent a non-negligible fraction of
their lifetime in the disk's upper regions, where the irradiation by cosmic
rays was strong. To do so, we used a coupled disk-transport-irradiation model
to calculate the time evolution of the molecular oxygen abundance
radiolytically produced in ice grains. Our computations show that, even if a
significant fraction of the icy particles have followed a back and forth cycle
towards the upper layers of the disk over 10 million of years, a timespan far
exceeding the formation timescale of comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko, the
amount of produced molecular oxygen is at least two orders of magnitude lower
than the Rosetta observations. We conclude that the most likely scenario
remains the formation of molecular oxygen in low-density environments, such as
the presolar cloud, prior to the genesis of the protosolar nebula.

source confusion, causing issues when examining the main sequence (MS) of star
forming galaxies. This has typically been partially tackled by the use of
stacking. However, stacking only provides the average properties of the objects
in the stack. This work aims to trace the MS over $0.2\leq z<6.0$ using the
latest de-blended Herschel photometry, which reaches $\approx10$ times deeper
than the 5$\sigma$ confusion limit in SPIRE. This provides more reliable star
formation rates (SFRs), especially for the fainter galaxies, and hence a more
reliable MS. We built a pipeline that uses the spectral energy distribution
(SED) modelling and fitting tool CIGALE to generate flux density priors in the
Herschel SPIRE bands. These priors were then fed into the de-blending tool XID+
to extract flux densities from the SPIRE maps. Multi-wavelength data were
combined with the extracted SPIRE flux densities to constrain SEDs and provide
stellar mass (M$_{\star}$) and SFRs. These M$_{\star}$ and SFRs were then used
to populate the SFR-M$_{\star}$ plane over $0.2\leq z<6.0$. No significant
evidence of a high-mass turn-over was found; the best fit is thus a simple
two-parameter power law of the form
log(SFR)$=\alpha[$log(M$_{\star})-10.5]+\beta$. The normalisation of the power
law increases with redshift, rapidly at $z\lesssim1.8$, from $0.58\pm0.09$ at
$z\approx0.37$ to $1.31\pm0.08$ at $z\approx1.8$. The slope is also found to
increase with redshift, perhaps with an excess around $1.8\leq z<2.9$. The
increasing slope indicates that galaxies become more self-similar as redshift
increases, implying that the specific SFR of high-mass galaxies increases over
$z=0.2$ to $z=6.0$, becoming closer to that of low-mass galaxies. The excess in
the slope at $1.8\leq z<2.9$, if present, coincides with the peak of the cosmic
star formation history.

Counting functions arising this way, and their associated generating series,

Macpherson further asked if the orbit algebra of $G$ - a graded commutative

finitely generated. In this paper, we announce a proof of a stronger statement:
the orbit algebra is Cohen-Macaulay. The generating series of the profile is a

display a simple correlation with the concentration changes since 1880 so that
other reasons are to be considered to contribute notably. An important feature
in this context is the shrinking of the polar ice caps observed in recent
years. We have studied the direct effect of the loss of global sea ice since
1955 on the mean global temperature estimating the corresponding decrease of
the terrestrial albedo. Using a simple 1-dimensional model the global warming
of the surface is computed that is generated by the increase of GHG and the
albedo change. A modest effect by the GHG of 0.08 K is calculated for the
period 1880 to 1955 with a further increase by 0.18K for 1955 to 2015. A larger
contribution of 0.55 +/-0.05 K is estimated for the melting of polar sea ice
(MSI) in the latter period, i.e. it notably exceeds that of the GHG and may be
compared with the observed global temperature rise of 1.0 +/- 0.1 K during the
past 60 years. Our data also suggest a delayed response of the mean global
temperature to the loss of sea ice with a time constant of approximately 20
years. The validity of the theoretical model and the interrelation between
GHG-warming and MSI-effect are discussed.

computes the time dependent reflection spectra of the disc as a response to a
flash of primary power-law radiation from a point source corona located on the
axis of the black hole accretion disc (lamp-post geometry). Full relativistic
effects are taken into account. The ionisation of the disc is set for each
radius according to the amount of the incident primary flux and the density of
the accretion disc. We tested the model by fitting model predictions to the
observed time-lag spectra of three Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (ARK 564,
MCG-6-30-15 and 1H 0707-495), assuming either a rapidly or zero spinning black
hole (BH). The time-lags strongly suggest a compact X-ray source, located close
to the BH, at a height of approx. 4 gravitational radii. This result does not
depend either on the BH spin or the disc ionization. There is no significant
statistical difference between the quality of the best-fits in the rapidly and
zero spinning BH scenarios in Ark 564 and MCG-6-30-15. But there is an
indication that the hypothesis of a non-rotating BH in 1H 0707-495 is not
consistent with its time-lag spectrum. Finally, the best-fits to the Ark 564

the best-fit reverberation model time-lags at high frequencies. This result
suggests that the simple lamp-post geometry does not fully explain the X-ray

promising solution for future wireless technologies. They enable additional
efficiency and increased lifetime to wireless networks. This paper investigates
a multiple-relay selection scheme for an EH-based two-way relaying (TWR)
system. All relays are considered as EH nodes that harvest energy from
renewable energy and radio frequency (RF) sources. Some of them are selected to
forward data to the destinations. The power splitting (PS) protocol, by which
the EH node splits the input RF signal into two components for EH and
information transmission, is adopted at the relay nodes. The objective is to
jointly optimize i) the set of selected relays, ii) their PS ratios, and iii)
their transmit power levels in order to maximize data rate-based utilities over
multiple coherent time slots. A joint-optimization solution based on geometric
programming (GP) and binary particle swarm optimization is proposed to solve
non-convex problems for two utility functions reflecting the level of fairness
in the TWR transmission. Numerical results illustrate the system's behavior
versus various parameters and show that the performance of the proposed scheme
is very close to that of the optimal branch-and-bound method and that GP
outperforms the dual problem-based method.

model for which the uniqueness threshold on the tree is not yet understood,
largely because of the absence of monotonicities. Jonasson established the
uniqueness threshold in the zero-temperature case, which corresponds to the
$q$-colourings model. In the permissive case (where the temperature is
positive), the Potts model has an extra parameter $\beta\in(0,1)$, which makes
the task of analysing the uniqueness threshold even harder and much less is
known.
  In this paper, we focus on the case $q=3$ and give a detailed analysis of the
Potts model on the tree by refining Jonasson's approach. In particular, we
establish the uniqueness threshold on the $d$-ary tree for all values of $d\geq
2$. When $d\geq3$, we show that the 3-state antiferromagnetic Potts model has
uniqueness for all $\beta\geq 1-3/(d+1)$. The case $d=2$ is critical since it
relates to the 3-colourings model on the binary tree ($\beta=0$), which has
non-uniqueness. Nevertheless, we show that the Potts model has uniqueness for
all $\beta\in (0,1)$ on the binary tree. Both of these results are tight since
it is known that uniqueness does not hold in the complementary regime.
  Our proof technique gives for general $q>3$ an analytical condition for
proving uniqueness based on the two-step recursion on the tree, which we
conjecture to be sufficient to establish the uniqueness threshold for all
non-critical cases ($q\neq d+1$).

engineered systems and profound prospects in the general study of complex
systems. Many efforts have been devoted to understanding how opinion dynamics
is affected by network topology. However, human social interactions are best
characterized as temporal networks in which ordering of interactions cannot be
ignored. Temporal activity patterns including heterogeneous contact strength
and interevent times, turnover edge/node dynamics and daily patterns could have
significant effects that would not be captured by static aggregate network
representations. In this paper, we study the effects of such temporal patterns
on the speed of consensus formation in various models of continuous opinion
dynamics using three empirical human face-to-face networks from different
real-world settings. We find that static, aggregated networks consistently
overestimate the speed of simulated consensus formation while weight
heterogeneity associated with frequency of interactions has an inhibitory
effect on consensus formation relative to the behavior on unweighted networks.
Moreover, the speed of consensus formation is found to be highly sensitive to
nodal lifetimes, suggesting that randomization protocols that dramatically
alter the distribution of lifetimes cannot be relied upon as reference models.
On the other hand, temporal patterns including burstiness of interevent times
and the lifetime of edges are found to have insignificant effects on consensus
formation.

the graphical calculus for monoidal categories. We give a definition of
stochastic independence based on the bimonoidal structure, compatible with the

  manuscript, thanks to the suggestions of the anonymous referee",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study a priori estimates for a class of non-negative local weak solution
to the weighted fast diffusion equation $u_t = |x|^{\gamma} \nabla\cdot
(|x|^{-\beta} \nabla u^m)$, with $0 < m <1$ posed on cylinders of
$(0,T)\times{\mathbb R}^N$. The weights $|x|^{\gamma}$ and $|x|^{-\beta}$, with
$\gamma < N$ and $\gamma -2 < \beta \leq \gamma(N-2)/N$ can be both degenerate
and singular and need not belong to the class $\mathcal{A}_2$, a typical
assumption for this kind of problems. This range of parameters is optimal for
the validity of a class of Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities, which play
the role of the standard Sobolev inequalities in this more complicated weighted
setting.
  The weights that we consider are not translation invariant and this causes a
number of extra difficulties and a variety of scenarios: for instance, the
scaling properties of the equation change when considering the problem around
the origin or far from it. We therefore prove quantitative - with computable
constants - upper and lower estimates for local weak solutions, focussing our
attention where a change of geometry appears. Such estimates fairly combine
into forms of Harnack inequalities of forward, backward and elliptic type. As a
consequence, we obtain H\""older continuity of the solutions, with a
quantitative (even if non-optimal) exponent. Our results apply to a quite large
variety of solutions and problems. The proof of the positivity estimates
requires a new method and represents the main technical novelty of this paper.
  Our techniques are flexible and can be adapted to more general settings, for
instance to a wider class of weights or to similar problems posed on Riemannian
manifolds, possibly with unbounded curvature. In the linear case, $m=1$, we
also prove quantitative estimates, recovering known results in some cases and
extending such results to a wider class of weights.

and knowledge from statistical physics. A prototypical example is the Boltzmann
machine algorithm for supervised learning, which utilizes knowledge of
classical thermal partition functions and the Boltzmann distribution. Recently,
a quantum version of the Boltzmann machine was introduced by Amin, et. al.,
however, non-commutativity of quantum operators renders the training process by
minimizing a cost function inefficient. Recent advances in the study of
non-equilibrium quantum integrable systems, which never thermalize, have lead
to the exploration of a wider class of statistical ensembles. These systems may
be described by the so-called generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE), which
incorporates a number of ""effective temperatures"". We propose that these GGE's
can be successfully applied as the basis of a Boltzmann-machine-like learning
algorithm, which operates by learning the optimal values of effective
temperatures. We show that the GGE algorithm is an optimal quantum Boltzmann
machine: it is the only quantum machine that circumvents the quantum
training-process problem. We apply a simplified version of the GGE algorithm,
where quantum effects are suppressed, to the classification of handwritten
digits in the MNIST database. While lower error rates can be found with other
state-of-the-art algorithms, we find that our algorithm reaches relatively low
error rates while learning a much smaller number of parameters than would be
needed in a traditional Boltzmann machine, thereby reducing computational cost.

based on Ito representations. We detail an algorithm using an estimator
stemming for the representation that, unlike regularization by noise
estimators, is unbiased. We rely on recent developments on branching
diffusions, regime switching processes and their representations of PDEs.
  There is a loose relation between our technique and regularization by noise,
but contrary to the latter, we add a perturbation and immediately its
correction. The method is only possible through a judicious choice of the
diffusion coefficient $\sigma$. A key feature is that our approach does not
rely on the smallness of $\sigma$, in fact, our $\sigma$ is strictly bounded
from below which is in stark contrast with standard perturbation techniques.
This is critical for extending this method to non-toy PDEs which have nonlinear
terms in the first derivative where the usual perturbation technique breaks
down.
  The examples presented show the algorithm outperforming alternative
approaches. Moreover, the examples point toward a potential algorithm for the
fully nonlinear case where the method of characteristics breaks down.

importance for the optimal control of queues in areas as diverse as computer
communications, communication networks, supply chains and manufacturing
systems. Our first main contribution is to identify the mean waiting time
completeness as a unifying aspect for four different dynamic priority
scheduling schemes by proving their completeness and equivalence in 2-class
M/G/1 queue. These dynamic priority schemes are earliest due date based, head
of line priority jump, relative priority, and probabilistic priority.
  In our second main contribution, we characterize the optimal scheduling
policies for the case studies in different domains by exploiting the
completeness of above dynamic priority schemes. The major theme of second main
contribution is resource allocation/optimal control in revenue management
problems for contemporary systems such as cloud computing, high-performance
computing, etc., where congestion is inherent. Using completeness and
theoretically tractable nature of relative priority policy, we study the impact
of approximation in a fairly generic data network utility framework. We
introduce the notion of min-max fairness in multi-class queues and show that a
simple global FCFS policy is min-max fair. Next, we re-derive the celebrated
$c/\rho$ rule for 2-class M/G/1 queues by an elegant argument and also simplify
a complex joint pricing and scheduling problem for a wider class of scheduling
policies.

of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) spectrograph to derive
two-dimensional (2D) maps of the various properties of the counter-rotating
stellar disks, such as age, metallicity, kinematics, spatial distribution, the
kinematical and chemical properties of the ionized gas, and the dust map. Due
to the large wavelength range, and in particular to the presence of the Calcium
Triplet 8498, 8542, 8662\AA (CaT hereafter), the spectroscopic analysis allows
us to separate the two stellar components in great detail. This permits precise
measurement of both the velocity and velocity dispersion of the two components
as well as their spatial distribution. We derived a 2D map of the age and
metallicity of the two stellar components as well as the star formation rate
and gas-phase metallicity from the ionized gas emission maps. The main stellar
disk of the galaxy is kinematically hotter, older, thicker and with larger
scale-length than the secondary disk. There is no doubt that the latter is
strongly linked to the ionized gas component: they have the same kinematics and
similar vertical and radial spatial distribution. This result is in favor of a
gas accretion scenario over a binary merger scenario to explain the origin of
counter-rotation in IC 719. One source of gas that may have contributed to the
accretion process is the cloud that surrounds IC 719.

Towards low-energy implementations, this paper investigates their training on

The two online algorithms are equivalent with training LDA by using
maximum-a-posterior estimation and maximizing the semi-collapsed likelihood,
respectively. They use novel, tailored ordinary differential equations for
stochastic optimization. We simulate the new algorithms and show that they are
comparable with the GPC algorithms, while being suitable for NMS
implementation. We also propose an extension to train pLSI and a method to

assumption of quasi-neutrality is presented. The system consists of fluid ions
and electrons as well as arbitrary numbers of species whose dynamics is
governed by the Vlasov equation. The proposed model is thus a generalized
version of the well-known standard hybrid plasma simulation model, in which the
ions are fully kinetic whereas the electrons are assumed to be a fluid. Since
the proposed model employs the exact form of the generalized Ohm's law, the
mass and energy densities, as well as the charge-to-mass ratio of the kinetic
species, are taken to be arbitrary. In the absence of the kinetic species, it
reduces to the quasi-neutral two-fluid model (Amano, 2015, JCP). In the
opposite situation where the mass and energy densities of the kinetic species
are much larger than the fluid ions, it is nothing more than the standard
hybrid model with finite electron inertia effect. If the kinetic species is an
energetic particle (EP) population having negligible mass density but
substantial energy density and the scale size is much larger than the ion and
electron inertial lengths, it describes the self-consistent coupling between
the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the EP dynamics. The
energetic-particle-magnetohydrodynamics (EP-MHD) hybrid model is thus a special
case of the more general model described in this paper. Advantages of this
approach over the existing models are discussed. A three-dimensional simulation
code solving the proposed set of equations is described. The code combines the
Particle-in-Cell scheme for solving the kinetic species and a
Riemann-solver-based code for the two-fluid equations. Several benchmark
simulation results are shown to confirm that the code successfully captures the
dynamics of the EP population interacting self-consistently with the MHD fluid.

network process. In partial epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly
synchronous seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic
zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We studied
patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients
with implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each
personalized brain model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes
equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating a
range of epileptiform discharges. Each patients virtual brain was further
personalized through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ.
Subsequent simulations and connectivity modulations were performed and
uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns. Across patients,
we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the
subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii)seizure propagation is
characterized by a systematic sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can
be controlled by an optimal intervention on the connectivity matrix; (iv) the
degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the here proposed
seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures,
neurosurgeons typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability
analysis of the network dynamics using graph theoretical metrics estimates
reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation. This suggests
novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage
partial epilepsy.

answer in the case of general points in the projective plane is predicted by
the famous Segre-Harbourne-Gimigliano-Hirschowitz conjecture.

probe physics beyond the Standard Model. Every measurement of untagged
time-integrated $B_s$-meson branching fractions is model-dependent due to the
time dependence of the experimental efficiency and the large lifetime
difference between the two $B_s$ mass eigenstates. In recent measurements, this
effect is bundled in the systematics. We reappraise the potential numerical
impact of this effect -- we find it to be close to 10% in real-life examples

therefore suggest that this model dependence be made explicit, i.e. that $B_s$

However, learning can be very fragile. The time to learn intervention policies

intervention timing can be crucial before the optimal window passes. We present
an approach that learns tailored personalization policies for groups of users
by combining RL and clustering. The benefits are two-fold: speeding up the
learning to prevent disengagement while maintaining a high level of
personalization. Our clustering approach utilizes dynamic time warping to
compare user trajectories consisting of states and rewards. We apply online and
batch RL to learn policies over clusters of individuals and introduce our
self-developed and publicly available simulator for e-Health interventions to
evaluate our approach. We compare our methods with an e-Health intervention

our setting. Furthermore, our proposed clustering approach for RL finds
near-optimal clusterings which lead to significantly better policies in terms

one non-personalized policy across all individuals. Our findings also indicate
that the learned policies accurately learn to send interventions at the right

shift the paradigm of wireless communication towards intelligence radios. One
of their core operations is automatic modulation recognition (AMR). Existing
research focuses on coherent modulation schemes such as QAM, PSK and FSK. The
AMR of (non-coherent) space-time modulation remains an uncharted area despite
its wide deployment in modern multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems.
The scheme using a so called Grassmann constellation enables rate-enhancement
using multi-antennas and blind detection. In this work, we propose an AMR
approach for Grassmann constellation based on data clustering, which differs
from traditional AMR based on classification using a modulation database. The
approach allows algorithms for clustering on the Grassmann manifold, such as
Grassmann K-means and depth-first search, originally developed for computer
vision to be applied to AMR. We further develop an analytical framework for
studying and designing these algorithms in the context of AMR. First, the
maximum-likelihood Grassmann constellation detection is proved to be equivalent
to clustering on the Grassmannian. Thereby, a well-known machine-learning
result that was originally established only for the Euclidean space is
rediscovered for the Grassmannian. Next, despite a rich literature on
algorithmic design, theoretical analysis of data clustering is largely
overlooked due to the lack of tractable techniques. We tackle the challenge by
introducing probabilistic metrics for measuring the inter-cluster separability
and intra-cluster connectivity of received space-time symbols and deriving them
using tools from differential geometry and Grassmannian packing. The results
provide useful insights into the effects of various parameters ranging from the
signal-to-noise ratio to constellation size, facilitating algorithmic design.

$\Theta(k \log \frac{n}{k})$-bit summary from which one can reconstruct $F$,
with high probability, given a related file $F'$ with edit distance $ED(F,F')

  The size of our summary is information-theoretically order optimal for all

[Orlitsky; FOCS'91]. It also is the first non-trivial solution for the
interesting setting where a small constant fraction of symbols have been
edited, producing an optimal summary of size $O(H(\delta)n)$ for $k=\delta n$.
This concludes a long series of better-and-better protocols which produce
larger summaries for sub-linear values of $k$ and sub-polynomial failure
probabilities. In particular, the recent break-through of [Belazzougui, Zhang;
FOCS'16] assumes that $k < n^\epsilon$, produces a summary of size $O(k\log^2 k

  We also give an efficient derandomized document exchange protocol with
summary size $O(k \log^2 \frac{n}{k})$. This improves, for any $k$, over a
deterministic document exchange protocol by Belazzougui with summary size

new efficient systematic error correcting codes for insertions and deletions.
These (binary) codes correct any $\delta$ fraction of adversarial

efficiency, which decreases with the number of active sensors, and fidelity,
which increases with the number of active sensors. The problem of minimizing
the time-averaged mean-squared error over infinite horizon is examined under
the constraint of the mean number of active sensors. The proposed methods
artfully combine Gibbs sampling and stochastic approximation for learning, in
order to create a high performance, energy efficient tracking mechanisms with
active sensor selection. Centralized tracking of i.i.d. process with known
distribution as well as an unknown parametric distribution are considered. For
an i.i.d. process with known distribution, convergence to the global optimal
solution with high probability is proved. The main challenge of the i.i.d. case
is that the process has a distribution parameterized by a known or unknown

proposed algorithm for tracking an i.i.d. process with unknown parametric
distribution converges to local optima. Numerical results show the efficacy of
the proposed algorithms and also suggest that global optimality is in fact

position of the point source. Applications include high-resolution single
molecule localization microscopy as well as the problem addressed in this paper
on localization of space debris using a space-based telescope. The localization
problem is discretized on a cubical lattice where the coordinates of nonzero
entries represent the 3D locations and the values of these entries the fluxes
of the point sources. Finding the locations and fluxes of the point sources is
a large-scale sparse 3D inverse problem. A new nonconvex regularization method
with a data-fitting term based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is proposed
for 3D localization for the Poisson noise model. In addition, we propose a new
scheme of estimation of the source fluxes from the KL data-fitting term.

allow tests of Einstein's theory with gravitational waves emitted when a small

particular test that is tailor-made for such inspirals is the search for chaos

resulting in exciting new techniques, new connections, and breakthroughs to
long standing open problems in several seemingly different topics. These
include seeded non-malleable extractors, privacy amplification protocols with
an active adversary, independent source extractors (and explicit Ramsey
graphs), and non-malleable codes in the split state model. However, in all
cases there is still a gap to optimum and the motivation to close this gap
remains strong.
  In this paper, we introduce a set of new techniques to further push the
frontier in the above questions. Our techniques lead to improvements in all of
the above questions, and in several cases partially optimal constructions.
Specifically, we obtain: 1. A seeded non-malleable extractor with seed length
$O(log n)+log^{1+o(1)}(1/\epsilon) and entropy requirement O(log log
n+log(1/\epsilon)), where the entropy requirement is asymptotically optimal by
a recent result of Gur and Shinkar \cite{GurS17}; 2. A two-round privacy
amplification protocol with optimal entropy loss for security parameter up to
\Omega(k), which solves the privacy amplification problem completely; 3. A
two-source extractor for entropy O(\frac{log n log log n}{log log log n}),
which also gives an explicit Ramsey graph on N vertices with no clique or
independent set of size (log N)^{O(\frac{log log log N}{log log log log N})};
and 4. The first explicit non-malleable code in the 2-split state model with
\emph{constant} rate, which has been a major goal in the study of non-malleable
codes for quite some time. One small caveat is that the error of this code is
only (an arbitrarily small) constant, but we can also achieve negligible error
with rate \Omega(log log log n/log log n), which already improves the rate in
\cite{Li17} exponentially.

respect to the incoming one is more appropriate. This article is based on the
latter choice and presents the modifications resulting from this change. The
model has been applied to multiple interactions of gravitons in large mass
conglomerations in several publications. They will be summarized here taking
the modified interaction process into account. In addition, the speed of
photons as a function of the gravitational potential are considered in this
context together with the dependence of atomic clocks and the redshift on the
gravitational potential.

PowerHammer, a malware (bridgeware [1]) that uses power lines to exfiltrate

compromised computer can control the power consumption of the system by
intentionally regulating the CPU utilization. Data is modulated, encoded, and
transmitted on top of the current flow fluctuations, and then it is conducted
and propagated through the power lines. This phenomena is known as a 'conducted

this attack, the attacker taps the in-home power lines1 that are directly
attached to the electrical outlet. Phase level power-hammering: In this attack,
the attacker taps the power lines at the phase level, in the main electrical
service panel. In both versions of the attack, the attacker measures the
emission conducted and then decodes the exfiltrated data. We describe the
adversarial attack model and present modulations and encoding schemes along
with a transmission protocol. We evaluate the covert channel in different
scenarios and discuss signal-to-noise (SNR), signal processing, and forms of

show that binary data can be covertly exfiltrated from air-gapped computers

First, our extraction algorithm is the first which identifies joint visual
attention in single static images. It computes 3D gaze direction, identifies
the gaze target by combining gaze direction with a 3D depth map computed for
the image, and identifies the common gaze target. Second, we use a human study

foregrounds always drown in tons of backgrounds and become hard examples during
training. Compared with those proposal-based ones, real-time detectors are in
far more serious trouble since they renounce the use of region-proposing stage
which is used to filter a majority of backgrounds for achieving real-time
rates. Though foregrounds as hard examples are in urgent need of being mined
from tons of backgrounds, a considerable number of state-of-the-art real-time
detectors, like YOLO series, have yet to profit from existing hard example
mining methods, as using these methods need detectors fit series of
prerequisites. In this paper, we propose a general hard example mining method
named Loss Rank Mining (LRM) to fill the gap. LRM is a general method for
real-time detectors, as it utilizes the final feature map which exists in all
real-time detectors to mine hard examples. By using LRM, some elements
representing easy examples in final feature map are filtered and detectors are
forced to concentrate on hard examples during training. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our method. With our method, the improvements of
YOLOv2 detector on auto-driving related dataset KITTI and more general dataset
PASCAL VOC are over 5% and 2% mAP, respectively. In addition, LRM is the first
hard example mining strategy which could fit YOLOv2 perfectly and make it
better applied in series of real scenarios where both real-time rates and
accurate detection are strongly demanded.

machinery and associated operational semantics to tackle the challenges of the
three main forms of reversibility, namely, backtracking, causal reversing and
out-of-causal-order reversing. Our proposal concerns a variation of Petri nets
where tokens are persistent and are distinguished from each other by an
identity which allows for transitions to be reversed spontaneously in or out of
causal order. Our design decisions are influenced by applications in
biochemistry but the methodology can be applied to a wide range of problems
