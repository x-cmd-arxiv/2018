susceptibility) that has been observed in Fe-based superconductors
AFe$_2$As$_2$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) is explained in terms of proximity to a van Hove
singularity. Using the Hubbard model we show that when the Fermi energy is in
the vicinity of a van Hove singularity, a downturn in spin susceptibility
occurs as the temperature is lowered. This behavior is characterized by a
temperature, $T^*$, which is determined by the difference in energy between the
Fermi level and the van Hove singularity. When vertex corrections are taken
into account in a dynamical mean-field approximation, the effect of
correlations amplifies the relative drop in the Knight shift and moves $T^*$ to
lower temperatures.

SUSY gauge theories. Taking advantage of the integrable structures emergent in
the theory, non-local observables such as null polygonal Wilson loops are
studied in $4d$ planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills. Their duality with the
$4d$ gluon scattering amplitudes makes the analysis even more interesting. The
so-called \emph{Pentagon approach}, an application of the Operator Product
Expansion (OPE) method to the null polygonal Wilsol loops, makes possible a
non-perturbative evaluation of these objects. They are recast as an OPE series
over the $2d$ GKP flux-tube excitations, a description reminescent of the QCD
flux-tube stretching between quarks. The integrability of the flux-tube allows
us to evaluate the series, in principle, for any value of the coupling
constant. From this analysis, several results have been obtained. In the strong
coupling regime we reproduced the TBA-like equations expected from the minimal
area problem in string theory, finding agreement with the $AdS/CFT$ prediction.
In this respect, of fundamental importance is the emergence of effective bound
states between elementary fermionic excitations. Along the way, we encountered
some intriguing analogies between these null polygonal Wilson loops and the
Nekrasov instanton partition function $\mathcal{Z}$ for $\mathcal{N}=2$
theories. Furthermore, a new non-perturbative enhancement of the classical
string argument has been confirmed, stemming from the dynamics of the string on
the five sphere $S^5$ and described by the non-linear $\sigma$-model $O(6)$.
Some properties of a fundamental building block of the OPE series, the $SU(4)$
structure of the form factors for a specific twist operator $\hat{P}$, have
been analysed. This $SU(4)$ matrix part is given a representation in terms of
rational functions, organized in a Young diagrams pattern.

we applied SfM algorithms to a unique image block with all the images of four

Microrobots, consisting of a linear chain of self-assembled magnetic

engineering attractive and repulsive interactions among microrobots and, thus,

in various science and engineering applications. Assuming sparse priority over

Wirtinger flow (SWF) and Sparse Truncated Amplitude flow (SPARTA). However, the
optimization cost functions of the mentioned algorithms are non-convex and
non-smooth. In order to fix the non-smoothness of the cost function, the SPARTA
method uses truncation thresholds to calculate a truncated step update
direction. In practice, the truncation procedure requires calculating more
parameters to obtain a desired performance in the phase recovery. Therefore,
this paper proposes an algorithm called SPRSF (Sparse Phase retrieval via
Smoothing Function) to solve the sparse PR problem by introducing a smoothing
function. SPRSF is an iterative algorithm where the update step is obtained by
a hard thresholding over a gradient descent direction. Theoretical analyses
show that the smoothing function uniformly approximates the non-convex and
non-smooth sparse PR optimization problem. Moreover, SPRSF does not require the
truncation procedure used in SPARTA. Numerical tests demonstrate that SPRSF
performs better than state-of-the-art methods, especially when there is no
knowledge about the sparsity $k$. In particular, SPRSF attains a higher mean
recovery rate in comparison with SPARTA, SAMP and SWF methods, when the
sparsity varies for the real and complex cases. Further, in terms of the
sampling complexity, the SPRSF method outperforms its competitive alternatives.

estimates the source realization. The receiver also feeds back the channel
state and an acknowledgment for successful reception to the transmitter. We
consider two models for the source---finite state Markov chains and first-order
autoregressive processes. For the first model, using ideas from team theory, we
establish the structure of optimal transmission and estimation strategies and

temperature-dependent magnetization of a single crystal of GdCo$_5$ in magnetic
fields of order 60 T. At zero temperature the calculations, based on
density-functional theory in the disordered-local-moment picture, predict a
field-induced transition from an antiferromagnetic to a canted alignment of Gd
and Co moments at 46.1 T. At higher temperatures the calculations find this
critical field to increase along with the zero-field magnetization. The
experimental measurements observe this transition to occur between 44-48 T at
1.4 K. Up to temperatures of at least 100 K, the experiments continue to
observe the transition; however, at variance with the calculations, no strong
temperature dependence of the critical field is apparent. We assign this
difference to the inaccurate description of the zero-field magnetization of the
calculations at low temperatures, due to the use of classical statistical
mechanics. Correcting for this effect, we recover a consistent description of
the high-field magnetization of GdCo$_5$ from theory and experiment.

behavior of leaving a problem blank, but this zero is not necessarily an
accurate assessment of student understanding of a particular topic. While some
might argue that this practice is 'fair' in that students are aware that they
can't receive points for problems they don't attempt, we share evidence that
this practice unequally impacts different student groups. We analyze 10 years

offer significant advantages over standard cameras, namely a very high dynamic

because the same scene pattern can produce different events depending on the
motion direction, establishing event correspondences across time is
challenging. By contrast, standard cameras provide intensity measurements

on frames and subsequently tracks them asynchronously using events, thereby
exploiting the best of both types of data: the frames provide a photometric

low-latency updates. In contrast to previous works, which are based on
heuristics, this is the first principled method that uses raw intensity

number of physical phenomena associated with these processes. In this paper, we
present a spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of the interacting galaxy NGC
4656 and its companion Tidal Dwarf Galaxy (TDG) candidate, NGC 4656UV. Using
Fabry-Perot and GMOS multi-slit data, we investigated the possible origin of
NGC 4656UV. We found that NGC 4656UV has a low metallicity
(12+log(O/H)$\sim$8.2) and it follows the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for
normal dwarf galaxies. For NGC 4656, we estimated a flat oxygen abundance
gradient of $\beta$ = -0.027$\pm$0.029 dex kpc$^{-1}$, which suggests the
presence of gas flows induced by gravitational interactions. By analysing
radial velocity profiles and by fitting a kinematic model of the observed
velocity field, we confirm the literature result that NGC 4656 consists of one
single body instead of two objects. We estimated a dynamical mass of
$6.8^{1.8}_{-0.6}\times10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ and R of 12.1 kpc from the kinematic
model of NGC 4656. Although the observed velocity field is dominated by
rotation at large scales (V$_{max}$/$\sigma\gtrsim$2.8), important
non-rotational motions are present at small scales. Based on these new results,
and on previously published information, we propose that NGC 4656 and 4656UV
are a pair of interacting galaxies. NGC 4656UV is a companion of NGC 4656 and
it does not have a tidal origin. The interaction between the two could have
triggered the star formation in NGC 4656UV and increased the star formation in
the northeast side of NGC 4656.

threading dislocations of the Ge buffer layer, propagating across the Ge-GeSn

challenges such as a high and variable path-loss caused by frequent changes in
the relative node positions as well as the surrounding environment. An adaptive
wireless body area network (WBAN) scheme is presented that reconfigures the
network by learning from body kinematics and biosignals. It has very low
overhead since these signals are already captured by the WBAN sensor nodes to
support their basic functionality. Periodic channel fluctuations in activities
like walking can be exploited by reusing accelerometer data and scheduling
packet transmissions at optimal times. Network states can be predicted based on
changes in observed biosignals to reconfigure the network parameters in real
time. A realistic body channel emulator that evaluates the path-loss for
everyday human activities was developed to assess the efficacy of the proposed
techniques. Simulation results show up to 41% improvement in packet delivery
ratio (PDR) and up to 27% reduction in power consumption by intelligent
scheduling at lower transmission power levels. Moreover, experimental results

bands, their topological properties are manifest in certain nontrivial
holonomies (Wilson loops) in the space of nontrivial bands. We introduce an

this index manifests as the winding of a hexagonal Wilson loop; this remains
true even in the absence of time-reversal or sixfold rotational symmetry.
Additionally, when time-reversal and twofold rotational symmetry are present,
we show directly that there is a protected nontrivial winding in more

For arbitrary $k$, the best-known approximation factor is $1.2965$ due to

improve on the lower bound to $1.20016$ by constructing an integrality gap

  A technical challenge in improving the gap has been the lack of geometric
tools to understand higher-dimensional simplices. Our instance is a non-trivial
$3$-dimensional instance that overcomes this technical challenge. We analyze
the gap of the instance by viewing it as a convex combination of
$2$-dimensional instances and a uniform 3-dimensional instance. We believe that
this technique could be exploited further to construct instances with larger
integrality gap. One of the ingredients of our proof technique is a
generalization of a result on \emph{Sperner admissible labelings} due to

$\int_\mathbb{R} |\rho(s)|^dds<\infty$, then the celebrated Breuer-Major
theorem (in its continuous version) asserts that the finite-dimensional
distributions of
$Z_\varepsilon:=\sqrt{\varepsilon}\int_0^{\cdot/\varepsilon}f(Y(s))ds$ converge
to those of $\sigma W$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$, where $W$ is a standard Brownian
motion and $\sigma$ is some explicit constant. Since its first appearance in
1983, this theorem has become a crucial probabilistic tool in different areas,
for instance in signal processing or in statistical inference for fractional
Gaussian processes.
  The goal of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we investigate the tightness in
the Breuer-Major theorem. Surprisingly, this problem did not receive a lot of
attention until now, and the best available condition due to Ben Hariz [1] is
neither arguably very natural, nor easy-to-check in practice. In contrast, our
condition very simple, as it only requires that $|f|^p$ must be integrable with
respect to the standard Gaussian measure for some $p$ strictly bigger than 2.
It is obtained by means of the Malliavin calculus, in particular Meyer
inequalities.
  Secondly, and motivated by a problem of geometrical nature, we extend the
continuous Breuer-Major theorem to the notoriously difficult case of
self-similar Gaussian processes which are not necessarily stationary. An
application to the fluctuations associated with the length process of a
regularized version of the bifractional Browninan motion concludes the paper.

expectations based on conventional materials, and hold promise for the
development of devices with new functionalities. While several theoretically
proposed TMs have been experimentally confirmed, extensive experimental
exploration of topological properties as well as applications in realistic
devices have been held back due to the lack of excellent TMs in which
interference from trivial Fermi surface states is minimized. We tackle this
problem in the present work by applying our recently developed method of
symmetry indicators to all non-magnetic compounds in the 230 space groups. An
exhaustive database search reveals thousands of TM candidates. Of these, we
highlight the excellent TMs, the 258 topological insulators and 165 topological
crystalline insulators which have either noticeable full band gap or a
considerable direct gap together with small trivial Fermi pockets. We also give
a list of 489 topological semimetals with the band crossing points located near
the Fermi level. All predictions obtained through standard generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) calculations were cross-checked with the modified
Becke-Johnson (MBJ) potential calculations, appropriate for narrow gap
materials. With the electronic and optical behavior around the Fermi level
dominated by the topologically non-trivial bands, these newly found TMs
candidates open wide possibilities for realizing the promise of TMs in
next-generation electronic devices.

considered. It turns out that with the addition of spin, the torsion terms in
Einstein-Cartan gravity do allow for energy condition respecting warp drives.
Limits are derived which minimize the amount of spin required in order to have
a weak/null-energy condition respecting system. This is done both for the
traditional Alcubierre warp drive as well as for the modified warp drive of Van
Den Broeck which minimizes the amount of matter required for the drive. The
ship itself is in a region of effectively vacuum and hence the torsion, which
in Einstein-Cartan theory is localized in matter, does not affect the geodesic
nature of the ship's trajectory. We also comment on the amount of spin and
matter required in order for these conditions to hold.

demanded repeated collection of fluorescent photons, which increases the

sense magnetic field strength with a precision comparable to those reported for
cryogenic experiments. Analysing large data sets from NV centres in bulk

multiple time step flow (multi-flow) prediction phase followed by a
flow-to-frame synthesis phase. The multi-flow prediction is modeled in a
variational probabilistic manner with spatial-temporal relationships learned
through 3D convolutions. The flow-to-frame synthesis is modeled as a generative
process in order to keep the predicted results lying closer to the manifold
shape of real video sequence. Such a two-phase design prevents the model from
directly looking at the high-dimensional pixel space of the frame sequence and
is demonstrated to be more effective in predicting better and diverse results.

that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against existing methods in

CPU, memory, bandwidth) of capacity-limited heterogeneous fog nodes to
competing services with diverse requirements and preferences in a fair and

market-based resource allocation framework in which the services act as buyers

aims to compute a market equilibrium (ME) solution at which every service
obtains its favorite resource bundle under the budget constraint while the
system achieves high resource utilization. This work extends the General
Equilibrium literature by considering a practical case of satiated utility
functions. Also, we introduce the notions of non-wastefulness and frugality for
equilibrium selection, and rigorously demonstrate that all the non-wasteful and
frugal ME are the optimal solutions to a convex program. Furthermore, the
proposed equilibrium is shown to possess salient fairness properties including
envy-freeness, sharing-incentive, and proportionality. Another major
contribution of this work is to develop a privacy-preserving distributed
algorithm, which is of independent interest, for computing an ME while allowing
market participants to obfuscate their private information. Finally, extensive
performance evaluation is conducted to verify our theoretical analyses.

high-resolution simulation of a Virgo-like cluster, run with RAMSES and with
dynamics reproducing that of a zoom cosmological simulation, to investigate the
interaction of infalling galaxies with the ICM. We find that the tails of ram
pressure stripped galaxies give rise to a population of up to more than a
hundred clumps of molecular gas lurking in the cluster. The number count of
those clumps varies a lot over time -- they are preferably generated when a
large galaxy crosses the cluster (M$_{200c} > 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$), and their
lifetime ($\lesssim 300$ Myr) is small compared to the age of the cluster. We
compute the intracluster luminosity associated with the star formation which
takes place within those clumps, finding that the stars formed in all of the
galaxy tails combined amount to an irrelevant contribution to the intracluster
light. Surprisingly, we also find in our simulation that the ICM gas
significantly changes the composition of the gaseous disks of the galaxies:
after crossing the cluster once, typically 20% of the cold gas still in those

important for constraining the AGN contribution to reionization and
understanding the growth of supermassive black holes. Recent inferences of the
luminosity function suffer from inconsistencies arising from inhomogeneous
selection and analysis of AGN data. We address this problem by constructing a
sample of more than 80,000 colour-selected AGN from redshift z=0 to 7.5. While
this sample is composed of multiple data sets with spectroscopic redshifts and
completeness estimates, we homogenise these data sets to identical cosmologies,
intrinsic AGN spectra, and magnitude systems. Using this sample, we derive the
AGN UV luminosity function from redshift z=0 to 7.5. The luminosity function
has a double power law form at all redshifts. The break magnitude $M_*$ of the
AGN luminosity function shows a steep brightening from $M_*\sim -24$ at z=0.7
to $M_*\sim -29$ at z=6. The faint-end slope $\beta$ significantly steepens
from $-1.7$ at $z<2.2$ to $-2.4$ at $z\simeq 6$. In spite of this steepening,
the contribution of AGN to the hydrogen photoionization rate at $z\sim 6$ is
subdominant (< 3%), although it can be non-negligible (~10%) if these
luminosity functions hold down to $M_{1450}=-18$. Under reasonable assumptions,
AGN can reionize HeII by redshift z=2.9. At low redshifts (z<0.5), AGN can
produce about half of the hydrogen photoionization rate inferred from the
statistics of HI absorption lines in the IGM. Our global analysis of the
luminosity function also reveals important systematic errors in the data,
particularly at z=2.2--3.5, which need to be addressed and incorporated in the
AGN selection function in future in order to improve our results. We make
various fitting functions, luminosity function analysis codes, and homogenised
AGN data publicly available.

fracton phases. We discover that charge remains localized at its initial
position, providing a crisp example of a non-ergodic dynamical phase of random
circuit dynamics. This localization can be understood as a consequence of the
return properties of low dimensional random walks, through a mechanism
reminiscent of weak localization, but insensitive to dephasing. The charge
dynamics is well-described by a system of coupled hydrodynamic equations, which
makes several nontrivial predictions in good agreement with numerics.
Importantly, these equations also predict localization in 2d fractonic
circuits. Immobile fractonic charge emits non-conserved operators, whose
spreading is governed by exponents distinct to non-fractonic circuits.
Fractonic operators exhibit a short time linear growth of observable
entanglement with saturation to an area law, as well as a subthermal volume law
for operator entanglement. The entanglement spectrum follows semi-Poisson
statistics, similar to eigenstates of MBL systems. The non-ergodic
phenomenology persists to initial conditions containing non-zero density of
dipolar or fractonic charge. Our work implies that low-dimensional fracton
systems preserve forever a memory of their initial conditions in local
observables under noisy quantum dynamics, thereby constituting ideal memories.
It also implies that 1d and 2d fracton systems should realize true MBL under
Hamiltonian dynamics, even in the absence of disorder, with the obstructions to
MBL in translation invariant systems and in d>1 being evaded by the nature of
the mechanism responsible for localization. We also suggest a possible route to
new non-ergodic phases in high dimensions.

the accretion-disk structure. We find that viscous inflow in the disk gives
rise to continuous wind-outflow of mostly C/O material mixed with
nuclear-burning products arising from a weak detonation occurring in the
inner-region of the disk. We find that such transients are energetically weak
($10^{48}-10^{49}$ergs) compared with thermonuclear-supernovae (SNe), and are
dominated by the (gravitational) accretion-energy. Although
thermonuclear-detonations occur robustly in all of our simulations (besides the
He-WD) they produce only little energy $(1-10\%$ of the kinetic energy) and
$^{56}{\rm Ni}$ ejecta (few$\times10^{-4}-10^{-3}{\rm M_{\odot}})$, with
overall low ejecta masses of $\sim0.01-0.1{\rm M_{\odot}}$. Such explosions may
produce rapidly-evolving transients, much shorter and fainter than regular

inconsistent with those of Ca-rich type Ib SNe. Though they might be related to

radiatively accelerates the CSM to produce broad, early-time line wings
independent of the Thomson optical depth of the CSM. Finally, the CSM
recombination rates in binaries can be dominated by a dense, cool, wind
collision interface like those seen in Wolf-Rayet binaries rather than the
individual stellar winds. Combining these three results, the flash spectroscopy

explained by an RSG with a normal, Thomson optically thin wind in a binary with
a separation of ~10^4 Rsun without any need for a pre-SN eruption. Similarly,
the broad line wings seen for the Type IIb iPTF13ast (SN 2013cu), whose

radiative acceleration of the CSM rather than pre-existing, Wolf-Rayet-like

correlations between the profile properties and SBHB parameters identified in

binary orbital separation and the degree of alignment of the black hole

massive (M_stars~10^11 M_Sun) compact (r_e,UV~100 pc) merger remnant at z=0.66
that is driving a 1000 km/s outflow of cool gas, with no observational trace of
an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We resolve molecular gas on scales of
approximately 1-2 kpc, and our main finding is the discovery of a wing of
blueshifted CO(2-1) emission out to -1000 km/s relative to the stars. We argue
that this is the molecular component of a multiphase outflow, expelled from the
central starburst within the past 5 Myr through stellar feedback, although we
cannot rule out previous AGN activity as a launching mechanism. If the latter
is true, then this is an example of a relic multiphase AGN outflow. We estimate
a molecular mass outflow rate of approximately 300 M_Sun/yr, or about one third
of the 10 Myr-averaged star formation rate. This system epitomizes the
multiphase 'blowout' episode following a dissipational major merger - a process
that has violently quenched central star formation and supermassive black hole
growth.

found to be both FIR-bright (typically $\sim 15$ mJy) and blended within the
Herschel 250 $\mu$m beam. We identify a spectroscopic or photometric redshift
for each FIR-bright source. We conduct a joint probability distribution
analysis on the redshift probability density functions to determine the
fraction of the FIR sources with multiple FIR-bright counterparts which are
likely to be found at consistent ($\Delta z$ $< 0.01$) redshifts. We find that
only 3 (0.4 per cent) of the pair permutations between counterparts are $>50$
per cent likely to be at consistent redshifts. A majority of counterparts (72
per cent) have no overlap in their redshift probability distributions
whatsoever. This is in good agreement with the results of recent simulations,
which indicate that single-dish observations of the FIR sky should be strongly
contaminated by line of sight projection effects. We conclude that for our

the overwhelming majority of multi-component FIR systems are line of sight
projections within the 18.1 arcsec Herschel beam, rather than physical

used recently as a tool to define and describe many-body quantum chaos. Here,
we develop the Keldysh non-linear sigma model technique to calculate these
correlators in interacting disordered metals. In particular, we focus on the
regularized and unregularized OTOCs, defined as $Tr[\sqrt{\rho} A(t)
\sqrt{\rho} A^\dagger(t)]$ and $Tr[\rho A(t)A^\dagger(t)]$ respectively (where
$A(t)$ is the anti-commutator of fermion field operators and $\rho$ is the
thermal density matrix). The calculation of the rate of OTOCs' exponential
growth is reminiscent to that of the dephasing rate in interacting metals, but
here it involves two replicas of the system (two ""worlds""). The intra-world
contributions reproduce the dephasing (that would correspond to a decay of the
correlator), while the inter-world terms provide a term of the opposite sign
that exceeds dephasing. Consequently, both regularized and unregularized OTOCs
grow exponentially in time, but surprisingly we find that the corresponding
many-body Lyapunov exponents are different. For the regularized correlator, we
reproduce an earlier perturbation theory result for the Lyapunov exponent that
satisfies the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound. However, the Lyapunov exponent
of the unregularized correlator parametrically exceeds the bound. We argue that
the latter is not a reliable indicator of many body quantum chaos as it
contains additional contributions from elastic scattering events due to virtual
processes that should not contribute to many-body chaos. These results bring up
an important general question of the physical meaning of the OTOCs often used
in calculations and proofs. We briefly discuss possible connections of the
OTOCs to observables in quantum interference effects and level statistics via a
many-body analogue of the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture.

helps us in mitigating the effects of Non-Global logarithms and pile up. For
the particular case of a $B$ meson, we identify two distinct regimes of the

very good discriminating power between heavy quark and gluon initiated jets. We
observe that the shape of the spectrum is independent of the energy of the jet

Aa,Abc (also potentially resolvable), where Ab,Ac is a double-lined binary with
equal components, for which we compute the spectroscopic orbit. Despite the
short period of 2.4058 day, the orbit of Ab,Ac is eccentric (e=0.086+-0.003).
It has a large inclination, but there are no eclipses; only a 4.4 mmag light
modulation apparently caused by star spots on the components of this binary is
detected with Evryscope. Assuming a moderate extinction of A_V = 0.5 mag and a
parallax of 5.2 mas, we find that the stars are on or close to the main
sequence (age >10 Myr) and their masses are from 1 to 1.3 solar. We measure the
strength of the Lithium line in the visual secondary B which, together with
rotation, suggests that the system is younger than 150 Myr. This object is
located behind the extension of the Chamaeleon I dark cloud (which explains
extinction and interstellar Sodium absorption), but apparently does not belong
to it. We propose a scenario where the inner orbit has recently acquired its
high eccentricity through dynamical interaction with the outer two components;
it is now undergoing rapid tidal circularization on a time scale of ~1 Myr.
Alternatively, the eccentricity could be excited quasi-stationary by the outer
component Aa.

attractors of differential dynamical systems. A global attractor is the minimal
set that attracts all bounded sets; it contains all forward-time limit points.
Our approach uses (generalised) Lyapunov functions to find attracting sets,
which must contain the global attractor, and the choice of Lyapunov function is
optimised based on the quantity whose extreme value one aims to bound. We also
present a non-global framework for bounding extrema over the minimal set that
is attracting in a specified region of state space. If the dynamics are
governed by ordinary differential equations, and the equations and quantities
of interest are polynomial, then our methods can be implemented computationally
using polynomial optimisation. In particular, we enforce nonnegativity of
certain polynomial expressions by requiring them to be representable as sums of
squares, leading to a convex optimisation problem that can be recast as a
semidefinite program and solved computationally. This computer assistance lets
one construct complicated polynomial Lyapunov functions. Computations are
illustrated using three examples. The first is the chaotic Lorenz system, where
we bound extreme values of various monomials of the coordinates over the global
attractor. In the second example we bound extreme values in a nine-mode
truncation of fluid dynamics which displays long-lived chaotic transients. The
third example has two locally stable limit cycles, each with its own basin of
attraction, and we apply our non-global framework to construct bounds for one
basin that do not apply to the other. For each example we compute Lyapunov
functions of polynomial degrees up to at least eight. In cases where we can
judge the sharpness of our bounds, they are sharp to at least three digits when
the polynomial degree is at least four or six.

prediction or variables selection is a recurring problem in prognosis studies,
leading to many publications on methods comparison. But some aspects have
received little attention. First, most comparison studies treat prediction
performance and variable selection aspects separately. Second, methods are
either compared within a binary outcome setting (based on an arbitrarily chosen
delay) or within a survival setting, but not both. In this paper, we propose a
comparison methodology to weight up those different settings both in terms of
prediction and variables selection, while incorporating advanced machine
learning strategies. Methods: Using a high-dimensional case study on a
sickle-cell disease (SCD) cohort, we compare 8 statistical methods. In the
binary outcome setting, we consider logistic regression (LR), support vector
machine (SVM), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB) and neural network
(NN); while on the survival analysis setting, we consider the Cox Proportional
Hazards (PH), the CURE and the C-mix models. We then compare performances of
all methods both in terms of risk prediction and variable selection, with a
focus on the use of Elastic-Net regularization technique. Results: Among all
assessed statistical methods assessed, the C-mix model yields the better
performances in both the two considered settings, as well as interesting
interpretation aspects. There is some consistency in selected covariates across
methods within a setting, but not much across the two settings. Conclusions: It
appears that learning withing the survival setting first, and then going back
to a binary prediction using the survival estimates significantly enhance
binary predictions.

dynamics, vibrations and heat is invaluable for many practical application and
possible by exploiting the strong radiation-matter coupling. Most of the modern
strong microwave photon-magnon coupling developments rely on the integration of
metal-based microwave resonators with a magnetic material. However, it has
recently been realised that all-dielectric resonators made of or containing
magneto-insulating materials can operate as a standalone strongly-coupled
system characterised by low dissipation losses and strong local microwave field
enhancement. Here, after a brief overview of recent developments in the field,
I discuss examples of such dielectric resonant systems and demonstrate their
ability to operate as multiresonant antennas for light, microwaves, magnons,
sound, vibrations and heat. This multiphysics behaviour opens up novel
opportunities for the realisation of multiresonant coupling such as, for
example, photon-magnon-phonon coupling. I also propose several novel systems in
which strong photon-magnon coupling in dielectric antennas and similar
structures is expected to extend the capability of existing devices or may
provide an entirely new functionality. Examples of such systems include novel
magnetofluidic devices, high-power microwave power generators, and hybrid
devices exploiting the unique properties of electrical solitons.

we refer to as deep material network, is developed based on mechanistic
homogenization theory of representative volume element (RVE) and advanced
machine learning techniques. We propose to use a collection of connected
mechanistic building blocks with analytical homogenization solutions which
avoids the loss of essential physics in generic neural networks, and this
concept is demonstrated for 2-dimensional RVE problems and network depth up to
7. Based on linear elastic RVE data from offline direct numerical simulations,
the material network can be effectively trained using stochastic gradient
descent with backpropagation algorithm, enhanced by model compression methods.
Importantly, the trained network is valid for any local material laws without
the need for additional calibration or micromechanics assumption. Its
extrapolations to unknown material and loading spaces for a wide range of
problems are validated through numerical experiments, including linear
elasticity with high contrast of phase properties, nonlinear history-dependent
plasticity and finite-strain hyperelasticity under large deformations.
  By discovering a proper topological representation of RVE with fewer degrees
of freedom, this intelligent material model is believed to open new
possibilities of high-fidelity efficient concurrent simulations for a
large-scale heterogeneous structure. It also provides a mechanistic
understanding of structure-property relations across material length scales and
enables the development of parameterized microstructural database for material
design and manufacturing.

dynamics. Yet it has long been difficult to constrain this component in disks
others than the Milky Way. This article presents the modeling of the
azimuthal-to-radial axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid of galactic disks from
stellar dispersion maps using integral field spectroscopy data of the CALIFA
survey. The measured azimuthal anisotropy is shown to be not strongly dependent
on the assumed vertical-to-radial dispersion ratio of the ellipsoid. The
anisotropy distribution shows a large diversity in the orbital structure of
disk galaxies from tangential to radial stellar orbits. Globally, the orbits
are isotropic in inner disk regions and become more radial as a function of
radius, although this picture tends to depend on galaxy morphology and
luminosity. The Milky Way orbital anisotropy profile measured from the Second
Gaia Data Release is consistent with those of CALIFA galaxies. A new
correlation is evidenced, linking the absolute magnitude or stellar mass of the
disks to the azimuthal anisotropy. More luminous disks have more radial orbits
and less luminous disks have isotropic and somewhat tangential orbits. This
correlation is consistent with the picture in galaxy evolution in which orbits
become more radial as the mass grows and is redistributed as a function of
time. With the help of circular velocity curves, it is also shown that the
epicycle theory fails to reproduce the diversity of the azimuthal anisotropy of
stellar random motions, as it predicts only nearly radial orbits in the
presence of flat curves. The origin of this conflict is yet to be identified.
It also questions the validity of the vertical-to-radial axis ratio of the
velocity ellipsoid derived by many studies in the framework of the epicyclic
approximation.

X-ray Fourier coherence and lag spectra are similar to those obtained in
previous studies of GX 339-4 using optical light curves. In particular, above 1
Hz, the lag spectrum features an approximately constant IR lag of about 100 ms.
We model simultaneously the radio to IR Spectral Energy Distribution (SED), the
IR Power Spectral Density (PSD), and the coherence and lag spectra using the
jet internal shock model ISHEM assuming that the fluctuations of the jet
Lorentz factor are driven by the accretion flow. It turns out that most of the
spectral and timing features, including the 100 ms lag, are remarkably well
reproduced by this model. The 100 ms time-scale is then associated with the
travel time from the accretion flow to the IR emitting zone. Our exploration of
the parameter space favours a jet which is at most mildly relativistic
($\bar{\Gamma}< 3$), and a linear and positive relation between the jet Lorentz
factor and X-ray light curve i.e. $\Gamma(t)-1\propto L_{X}(t)$. The presence
of a strong Low Frequency Quasi Periodic Oscillation (LFQPO) in the IR light
curve could be caused by jet precession driven by Lense-Thirring precession of
the jet-emitting accretion flow. Our simulations confirm that this mechanism
can produce an IR LFQPO similar to that observed in GX 339-4.

stars centered within a 0.5 mag region about a 1 Gyr isochrone, removing many
sub-giants and unresolved binary stars from the sample. The rotation period
bimodality, originally discovered by McQuillan et al. (2013), is clearly
recovered for stars out to 525pc, but is not detectable at further distances.
This bimodality correlates with Galactic height as well, dropping strongly for
stars above Z>90 pc. We also find a significant width in the stellar main
sequence of $\Delta M_G$ ~0.25 mag, as well as a coherent gradient of
increasing rotation periods orthogonal to the main sequence. We interpret this
as a signature of stellar angular momentum loss over time, implying a
corresponding diagonal age gradient across the main sequence. Stellar evolution
models predict changes in color and luminosity that are consistent in
amplitude, but not in direction, with those required to produce the gradient we
have detected. This rotation gradient suggests that main sequence evolution
produces offsets in color-magnitude space that are significantly more
orthogonal to the zero-age main sequence than models currently predict, and may
provide new tests for both stellar evolution and gyrochronology models.

likely the last one of such magnitudes of Solar Cycle 24 as the Sun heads
toward the minimum. Its remarkable characteristics include the following. (1)
The wave was observed, for the first time, to traverse the full-Sun corona over
the entire visible solar disk and off-limb circumference, manifesting a truly
global nature, owing to its exceptionally large amplitude, e.g., with EUV
enhancements by up to 300% at 1.1 Rsun from the eruption. (2) This leads to
strong transmissions (in addition to commonly observed reflections) in and out
of both polar coronal holes, which are usually devoid of EUV waves. It has
elevated wave speeds >2000 km/s within them, consistent with the expected
higher fast-mode magnetosonic wave speeds. The coronal holes essentially serve
as new ""radiation centers"" for the waves being refracted out of them, which
then travel toward the equator and collide head-on, causing additional EUV
enhancements. (3) The wave produces significant compressional heating to local
plasma upon its impact, indicated by long-lasting EUV intensity changes and
differential emission measure increases at higher temperatures (e.g., log
T=6.2) accompanied by decreases at lower temperatures (e.g., log T=6.0). These
characteristics signify the potential of such EUV waves for novel magnetic and
thermal diagnostics of the solar corona {\it on global scales}.

including radiative feedback from sink particles suppresses fragmentation even
further than calculations that only include radiative transfer within the gas.
This reduces the star-formation rate following the formation of the initial
protostars, leading to fewer objects being produced and a lower total stellar
mass. The luminosities of sink particles vary due to changes in the accretion
rate driven by the dynamics of the cluster gas, leading to different
luminosities for protostars of similar mass. Including feedback from sinks also
raises the median stellar mass. The median masses of the groups are higher than
typically observed values. This may be due to the lack of dynamical
interactions and ejections in small groups of protostars compared to those that
occur in richer groups. We also find that the temperature distributions in our
calculations are in qualitative agreement with recent observations of
protostellar heating in Galactic star-forming regions.

where they explicitly learn to count the objects of interest. These often
perform better than detection-based methods that need to learn the more
difficult task of predicting the location, size, and shape of each object.
However, we propose a detection-based method that does not need to estimate the
size and shape of the objects and that outperforms regression-based methods.
Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we propose a novel loss function that
encourages the network to output a single blob per object instance using
point-level annotations only; (2) we design two methods for splitting large
predicted blobs between object instances; and (3) we show that our method
achieves new state-of-the-art results on several challenging datasets including
the Pascal VOC and the Penguins dataset. Our method even outperforms those that
use stronger supervision such as depth features, multi-point annotations, and

with increased mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and hospital cost. Since
AKI is sometimes preventable, there is great interest in prediction. Most
existing studies consider all patients and therefore restrict to features
available in the first hours of hospitalization. Here, the focus is instead on
rehospitalized patients, a cohort in which rich longitudinal features from
prior hospitalizations can be analyzed. Our objective is to provide a risk
score directly at hospital re-entry. Gradient boosting, penalized logistic
regression (with and without stability selection), and a recurrent neural
network are trained on two years of adult inpatient EHR data (3,387 attributes
for 34,505 patients who generated 90,013 training samples with 5,618 cases and
84,395 controls). Predictions are internally evaluated with 50 iterations of
5-fold grouped cross-validation with special emphasis on calibration, an
analysis of which is performed at the patient as well as hospitalization level.
Error is assessed with respect to diagnosis, race, age, gender, AKI
identification method, and hospital utilization. In an additional experiment,
the regularization penalty is severely increased to induce parsimony and
interpretability. Predictors identified for rehospitalized patients are also
reported with a special analysis of medications that might be modifiable risk
factors. Insights from this study might be used to construct a predictive tool
for AKI in rehospitalized patients. An accurate estimate of AKI risk at
hospital entry might serve as a prior for an admitting provider or another
predictive algorithm.

highlight the relation to quantum information theory by pointing out that the
Fisher information metric of a Gaussian probability distribution corresponds to
an Anti-de Sitter space. As an application example of gauge/gravity duality, we
present a holographic Kondo model. The Kondo model in condensed matter physics
describes a spin impurity interacting with a free electron gas: At low
energies, the impurity is screened and there is a logarithmic rise of the
resistivity. In quantum field theory, this amounts to a negative beta function
for the impurity coupling and the theory flows to a non-trivial IR fixed point.
For constructing a gravity dual, we consider a large $N$ version of this model
in which the ambient electrons are strongly coupled even before the interaction
with the impurity is switched on. We present the brane construction which
motivates a gravity dual Kondo model and use this model to calculate the
impurity entanglement entropy and the resistivity, which has a power-law
behaviour. We also study quantum quenches, and discuss the relation to the

photoemission spectroscopy data and electronic band structure calculations, as
a possible representative of type-II Dirac semimetals. Here, we report on the
magnetotransport behavior (electrical resistivity, Hall effect) in this
compound, investigated on high-quality single-crystalline specimens. The
magnetoresistance (MR) of PtTe$_2$ is large (over $3000\%$ at $T=1.8$ K in
$B=9$ T) and unsaturated in strong fields in the entire temperature range
studied. The MR isotherms obey a Kohler's type scaling with the exponent $m$ =
1.69, different from the case of ideal electron-hole compensation. In applied
magnetic fields, the resistivity shows a low-temperature plateau,
characteristic of topological semimetals. In strong fields, well-resolved
Shubnikov - de Haas (SdH) oscillations with two principle frequencies were
found, and their analysis yielded charge mobilities of the order of
$10^3\,\rm{cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}}$ and rather small effective masses of charge
carriers, $0.11m_e$ and $0.21m_e$. However, the extracted Berry phases point to
trivial character of the electronic bands involved in the SdH oscillations. The
Hall effect data corroborated a multi-band character of the electrical
conductivity in PtTe$_2$, with moderate charge compensation.

broken spin-orbital symmetry on vanadium ions: either $C$-type alternating

alternating orbital order accompanied by $C$-type antiferromagnetic spin order.
Both states are experimentally observed and compete with each other in YVO$_3$
while only the latter was observed in LaVO$_3$. Orbital order is induced and
stabilized by particular patterns of oxygen distortions arising from the
Jahn-Teller effect. In contrast to time-consuming \textit{ab-initio}

Training generative models which capture such category-specific differences is
challenging because of the highly diverse appearance of faces in ads and the

of the canonical energy is difficult to establish, due to the presence of

distributed at random and in a correlated manner, in separate models, is
studied by means of computer simulations. The strain rate sensitivity and
strength are evaluated in terms of the obstacle strength, temperature and
applied shear stress. Above a threshold stress, the dislocation motion
undergoes a transition from smooth to jerky, i.e. obstacles are overcome in a
correlated manner at high stresses, while at low stresses they are overcome
individually. This leads to a significant reduction of the strain rate
sensitivity. The threshold stress depends on the obstacle strength and
temperature. A model is proposed to predict the strain rate sensitivity and the
smooth-to-jerky transition stress. Obstacle clustering has little effect on
strain rate sensitivity at low stress (creep conditions), but it becomes
important at high stress. It is concluded that models for the strength and
strain rate sensitivity should include higher moments of the obstacle density
distribution in addition to the mean density.

functional is introduced for deriving a weak formulation of the problem. A
specificity of this work is the consideration of the interface with a
fictitious domain approach. The latter is inspired by the XFEM approach in the
sense that cut-off functions are used, but it is simpler to implement since no
enrichment by singular functions is provided. In that context, getting
convergence for the dual variables defined on the interface is non-trivial. For
that purpose, an augmented Lagrangian technique stabilizes the convergence of
the multipliers, which is important because their value would determine the
dynamics of the interface in an unsteady framework. Theoretical analysis is
provided, where we show that a discrete inf-sup condition, independent of the

SCP generalizes the model checking problem as it entails classifying each state

or not $s$ satisfies a given time-bounded reachability specification. This is
an interesting problem in its own right, which NSC solves using
machine-learning techniques, Deep Neural Networks in particular. State
classifiers produced by NSC tend to be very efficient (run in constant time and
space), but may be subject to classification errors. To quantify and mitigate
such errors, our approach comprises: i) techniques for certifying, with
statistical guarantees, that an NSC classifier meets given accuracy levels; ii)
tuning techniques, including a novel technique based on adversarial sampling,
that can virtually eliminate false negatives (positive states classified as
negative), thereby making the classifier more conservative. We have applied NSC
to six nonlinear hybrid system benchmarks, achieving an accuracy of 99.25% to
99.98%, and a false-negative rate of 0.0033 to 0, which we further reduced to
0.0015 to 0 after tuning the classifier. We believe that this level of accuracy

to the server. The goal of the user is to achieve information-theoretic privacy
by leveraging the side information about the database. The side information
consists of a random subset of $M$ messages in the database which could have
been obtained in advance from other users or from previous interactions with
the server. The identities of the messages forming the side information are
initially unknown to the server. Our goal is to characterize the capacity of
this setting, i.e., the maximum achievable download rate.
  In our previous work, we have established the PIR-SI capacity for the special
case in which the user wants a single message, i.e., $D=1$ and showed that the
capacity can be achieved through the Partition and Code (PC) scheme. In this
paper, we focus on the case when the user wants multiple messages, i.e., $D>1$.
Our first result is that if the user wants more messages than what they have as
side information, i.e., $D>M$, then the capacity is $\frac{D}{K-M}$, and it can
be achieved using a scheme based on the Generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes.
In this case, the user must learn all the messages in the database in order to
obtain the desired messages. Our second result shows that this may not be
necessary when $D\leq M$, and the capacity in this case can be higher. We
present a lower bound on the capacity based on an achievability scheme which we
call Generalized Partition and Code (GPC).

superior performance compared with other bilinear pooling based approaches.
Second, we propose a novel hierarchical bilinear pooling framework to integrate
multiple cross-layer bilinear features to enhance their representation

have nonnegative inputs, which are corrupted by additive white Gaussian noises.
Considering the illumination requirement and the physical characteristics of
lighting source, the input is also constrained in both its average and peak
optical intensities. Two scenarios are investigated: one is only with an
average optical intensity constraint, and the other is with both average and
peak optical intensity constraints. Based on information theory, closed-form
expressions of the upper and lower bounds on secrecy capacity for the two
scenarios are derived. Numerical results show that the upper and lower bounds
on secrecy capacity are tight, which validates the derived closed-form
expressions. Moreover, the asymptotic behaviors in the high signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) regime are analyzed from the theoretical aspects. At high SNR, when
only considering the average optical intensity constraint, a small performance
gap exists between the asymptotic upper and lower bounds on secrecy capacity.
When considering both average and peak optical intensity constraints, the
asymptotic upper and lower bounds on secrecy capacity coincide with each other.
These conclusions are also confirmed by numerical results.

strategies on seeking less budget-consumed worker-task pairs to meet
requesters' demands. Existing research on the task assignment with budget

modulation (SM) technique has recently drawn increased attention in the field
of visible light communications (VLC). To guarantee the number of bits mapped
by the transmitter's index at each timeslot is an integer, the number of
transmitters (i.e., light-emitting diodes) in the SM based VLC system is often
set be a power of two. To break the limitation on the required number of
transmitters and provide more design flexibility, this paper investigates the
SM based VLC with an arbitrary number of transmitters. Initially, a channel
adaptive bit mapping (CABM) scheme is proposed, which includes three steps: bit
mapping in space domain, bit mapping in signal domain, and the channel adaptive
mapping. The proposed CABM scheme allows operation with an arbitrary number of
transmitters, and is verified to be an efficient scheme through numerical
results. Based on the CABM scheme, the information-theoretical aspects of the
SM based VLC are analyzed. The theoretical expression of the mutual information
is first analyzed. However, it is very hard to evaluate system performance. To
obtain more insights, a lower bound of the mutual information is derived, which
is in closedform. Both theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the
gap between the mutual information and its lower bound is small. Finally, to
further improve the system performance, the precoding scheme is proposed for
the SM based VLC. Numerical results show that the system performance improves
dramatically when using the proposed precoding scheme.

aspects, the theoretical expression of the average SER is derived. To further
improve the system performance, an optimization problem is proposed to optimize
the modulation orders on the LEDs. The ASM based and the candidate reduction

identifies the resonance background contributions, coupled with the elliptic

high mass ($m_{inv}>1.5$ GeV/$c^{2}$) where resonance contribution is small, we
obtain the average $\Delta\gamma$ magnitude. In the low mass region
($m_{inv}<1.5$ GeV/$c^{2}$), resonance peaks are observed in
$\Delta\gamma$($m_{inv}$). An event shape engineering (ESE) method is used to
model the background shape in $m_{inv}$ to extract the potential CME signal at
low $m_{inv}$. In the comparative method, the $\Psi_{\rm RP}$ is assessed by
spectator neutrons measured by ZDC, and the $\Psi_{\rm PP}$ by the
2$^{nd}$-harmonic event plane measured by the TPC. The $v_{2}$ is stronger
along $\Psi_{\rm PP}$ and weaker along $\Psi_{\rm RP}$; in contrast, the
magnetic field, mainly from spectator protons, is weaker along $\Psi_{\rm PP}$
and stronger along $\Psi_{\rm RP}$. As a result, the $\Delta\gamma$ measured
with respect to $\Psi_{\rm RP}$ and $\Psi_{\rm PP}$ contain different amounts
of CME and background, and can thus determine these two contributions. It is
found that the possible CME signals with background isolation by these two

perturbations of input images, giving rise to adversarial examples. Though this
property is usually considered a weakness of learned models, we explore whether
it can be beneficial. We find that neural networks can learn to use invisible
perturbations to encode a rich amount of useful information. In fact, one can
exploit this capability for the task of data hiding. We jointly train encoder
and decoder networks, where given an input message and cover image, the encoder
produces a visually indistinguishable encoded image, from which the decoder can
recover the original message. We show that these encodings are competitive with
existing data hiding algorithms, and further that they can be made robust to
noise: our models learn to reconstruct hidden information in an encoded image
despite the presence of Gaussian blurring, pixel-wise dropout, cropping, and
JPEG compression. Even though JPEG is non-differentiable, we show that a robust

demonstrate that adversarial training improves the visual quality of encoded

reverse attention to guide such side-output residual learning in a top-down

node/network approach is introduced for semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits.
The minimal node contains only 7 quantum dots, and nodes are separated on the
micron scale, creating useful space for wiring interconnects and integration of
conventional transistor circuits. Entanglement is distributed between
neighbouring nodes by loading spin singlets locally and then shuttling one
member of the pair through a linear array of empty dots. Each node contains one
data qubit, two ancilla qubits, and additional dots to facilitate electron
shuttling and measurement of the ancillas. A four-node GHZ state is realized by
sharing three internode singlets followed by local gate operations and ancilla
measurements. Further local operations and measurements produce an X or Z
stabilizer on four data qubits, which is the fundamental operation of the
surface code. Electron shuttling is simulated using a simplified gate electrode
geometry without explicit barrier gates, and demonstrates that adiabatic
transport is possible on timescales that do not present a speed bottleneck to
the processor. An important shuttling error in a clean system is uncontrolled
phase rotation due to the modulation of the electronic g-factor during
transport, owing to the Stark effect. This error can be reduced by appropriate
electrostatic tuning of the stationary electron's g-factor. Using reasonable
noise models, we estimate error thresholds with respect to single and two-qubit
gate fidelities as well as singlet dephasing errors during shuttling. A
twirling protocol transforms the non-Pauli noise associated with exchange gate
operations into Pauli noise, making it possible to use the Gottesman-Knill
theorem to efficiently simulate large codes.

principles for a logic of iterated belief revision. These principles, the DP
postulates, have been supplemented in a number of alternative ways. Most of the
suggestions made have resulted in a form of `reductionism' that identifies
belief states with orderings of worlds. However, this position has recently
been criticised as being unacceptably strong. Other proposals, such as the
popular principle (P), aka `Independence', characteristic of `admissible'
revision operators, remain commendably more modest. In this paper, we
supplement both the DP postulates and (P) with a number of novel conditions.
While the DP postulates constrain the relation between a prior and a posterior
conditional belief set, our new principles notably govern the relation between
two posterior conditional belief sets obtained from a common prior by different
revisions. We show that operators from the resulting family, which subsumes
both lexicographic and restrained revision, can be represented as relating
belief states that are associated with a `proper ordinal interval' (POI)
assignment, a structure more fine-grained than a simple ordering of worlds. We
close the paper by noting that these operators satisfy iterated versions of a
large number of AGM era postulates, including Superexpansion, that are not
sound for admissible operators in general.

the existence of two universal 'multi-body' resonances, where all multi-body

in good agreement with the star-forming main sequence, consistent with the

on HI gas at least on global scale, i.e., star formation rate (SFR) generally
increases with HI mass, specific star formation rate (SSFR$\equiv$SFR/M$_*$)
increases with HI fraction ($f_{HI}$) even for a given stellar mass, and
\hi-based star formation efficiency (SFE) mildly increases with the stellar

the dependence of $f_{HI}$ and SFE on them. The weak correlations between SFE

with excellent durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has
attracted increasing attention. The exotic and robust metallic surface states
of topological insulators (TIs) are theoretically predicted to enhance surface
catalytic activity of overlaying catalysts, but no experimental evidence for
TIs directly used as electrocatalysts has ever been reported. In this work, we
fabricated the TI thin films of Bi2Te3 with different thicknesses using the
molecular beam epitaxy method, and found that these thin films exhibit high
electrocatalytic activity in HER. The 48 nm Bi2Te3 thin film has the best
performance, which is attributed to its largest active area arising from the
spiral growth mode of triangular domains as revealed by atomic force microscopy
imaging. Importantly, our theoretical calculations reveal that while pure
Bi2Te3 is not a good electrocatalyst, the Bi2Te3 thin films with partially
oxidized surfaces or Te vacancies have high HER activity. The existence of the
corresponding surface oxides on the Bi2Te3 thin films is supported by our X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy data. Particularly, we demonstrate that the
topological surface states play a key role in enhancing the HER performance.
Our study offers a new direction to design cost-effective electrocatalysts.

In

Existing captioning models usually represent latent states as vectors, taking
this practice for granted. We rethink this choice and study an alternative
formulation, namely using two-dimensional maps to encode latent states. This is
motivated by the curiosity about a question: how the spatial structures in the
latent states affect the resultant captions? Our study on MSCOCO and Flickr30k
leads to two significant observations. First, the formulation with 2D states is
generally more effective in captioning, consistently achieving higher
performance with comparable parameter sizes. Second, 2D states preserve spatial
locality. Taking advantage of this, we visually reveal the internal dynamics in
the process of caption generation, as well as the connections between input

rigidity proliferation, to help identify the nature of the frictional jamming
transition as well as significantly broaden the scope of rigidity percolation.
For frictional rigidity percolation, we construct rigid clusters in two
different lattice models using a $(3,3)$ pebble game, while taking into account
contacts below and at the Coulomb threshold. The first lattice is a honeycomb
lattice with next-nearest neighbors, the second, a hierarchical lattice. For
both, we generally find a continuous rigidity transition. Our numerical results
suggest that, for the honeycomb lattice, the exponents associated with the
transition found with the frictional $(3,3)$ pebble game are distinct from
those of a central-force $(2,3)$ pebble game. We propose that localized motifs,
such as hinges, connecting rigid clusters that are allowed only with friction
could give rise to this new frictional universality class. However, the
closeness of the order parameter exponent between the two cases hints at
potential superuniversality. To explore this possibility, we construct a
bespoke cluster generating algorithm invoking generalized Henneberg moves,
dubbed minimal rigidity proliferation. The minimally rigid clusters the
algorithm generates appear to be in the same universality class as connectivity
percolation, suggesting superuniversality between all three types of
transitions. Finally, the hierarchical lattice is analytically tractable and we
find that the exponents depend both on the type of force and on the fraction of
contacts at the Coulomb threshold. These combined results allow us to compare
two universality classes on the same lattice via rigid clusters for the first
time to highlight unifying and distinguishing concepts within the set of all

SGGNN creates a graph to represent the pairwise relationships between

estimation can be achieved by using such updated probe-gallery relation
features for prediction. The input features for nodes on the graph are the
relation features of different probe-gallery image pairs. The probe-gallery
relation feature updating is then performed by the messages passing in SGGNN,
which takes other nodes' information into account for similarity estimation.
Different from conventional GNN approaches, SGGNN learns the edge weights with
rich labels of gallery instance pairs directly, which provides relation fusion
more precise information. The effectiveness of our proposed method is validated

at specific designs selected by an infill-sampling criterion. However, most
current BODE methods operate in specific contexts like optimization, or
learning a universal representation of the black-box function. The objective of
this paper is to design a BODE for estimating the statistical expectation of a
physical response surface. This QoI is omnipresent in uncertainty propagation
and design under uncertainty problems. Our hypothesis is that an optimal BODE
should be maximizing the expected information gain in the QoI. We represent the
information gain from a hypothetical experiment as the Kullback-Liebler (KL)
divergence between the prior and the posterior probability distributions of the
QoI. The prior distribution of the QoI is conditioned on the observed data and
the posterior distribution of the QoI is conditioned on the observed data and a
hypothetical experiment. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation
of a semi-analytic mathematical formula for the expected information gain about
the statistical expectation of a physical response. The developed BODE is
validated on synthetic functions with varying number of input-dimensions. We
demonstrate the performance of the methodology on a steel wire manufacturing
problem.

results of the first study investigating the evolution of the cloud population

see the cloud population shift to large unbound clouds in the wake of the
companion passage, with the largest clouds appearing as fleeting short-lived
agglomerations of smaller clouds within the tidal spiral arms, brought together
by large scale streaming motions. These are then sheared apart as they leave
the protection of the spiral arms. Clouds appear to lead diverse lives, even
within similar environments, with some being born from gas shocked by filaments
streaming into the spiral arms, and others from effectively isolated smaller
colliding pairs. Overall this cloud population produces a shallower mass
function than the disc in isolation, especially in the arms compared to the
inter-arm regions. Direct comparisons to M51 observations show similarities
between cloud populations, though models tailored to the mass and orbital
models of M51 appear necessary to precisely reproduce the cloud population.

shows that the rotation period of V473\,Tau is $1.406829(10)$ days, and has
slightly decreased with the variation rate of 0.11(3)~s~yr$^{-1}$ over time.
Also, the acceleration timescale of the star is found to be shorter than its
main sequence lifetime. This indicates that the process of decrease in period
might be reversible. On this basis, it can be suggested that V473\,Tau has a
possible magnetic acceleration and a differential rotation, which cause a
variation in the movement of inertia, and hence the observed period change.
Additionally, the evolution path of V473\,Tau on the H-R diagram is evaluated.
Accordingly, the position of the star on the diagram suggests that its magnetic
properties develop before it reaches the main sequence or in the beginning of
its main sequence lifetime.

be mapped to a boson model with effective boson-boson repulsion, which enables
us to solve the three-body ($N=2$) problem analytically and determine the
trimer energy for impurity-boson scattering lengths $a>0$. By analysing the
atom-dimer scattering amplitude, we find a critical scattering length $a^*$ at
which the atom-dimer scattering length diverges and the trimer merges into the
dimer continuum. We furthermore calculate the tetramer energy exactly for $a>0$
and show that the tetramer also merges with the continuum at $a^*$. Indeed,
since the critical point $a^*$ formally resembles the unitary point $1/a = 0$,
we find that all higher-body bound states (involving the impurity and $N>1$
bosons) emerge and disappear at both of these points. We show that the behavior
at these 'multi-body resonances' is universal, since it occurs for any model
with an effective three-body repulsion involving the impurity. Thus, we see
that the fixed-impurity problem is strongly affected by a three-body parameter

difficulty stems from the large diversity in the way people appear in crowds.
In fact, features available for crowd discrimination largely depend on the
crowd density to the extent that people are only seen as blobs in a highly
dense scene. We tackle this problem with a growing CNN which can progressively
increase its capacity to account for the wide variability seen in crowd scenes.
Our model starts from a base CNN density regressor, which is trained in
equivalence on all types of crowd images. In order to adapt with the huge
diversity, we create two child regressors which are exact copies of the base
CNN. A differential training procedure divides the dataset into two clusters
and fine-tunes the child networks on their respective specialties.
Consequently, without any hand-crafted criteria for forming specialties, the
child regressors become experts on certain types of crowds. The child networks
are again split recursively, creating two experts at every division. This
hierarchical training leads to a CNN tree, where the child regressors are more
fine experts than any of their parents. The leaf nodes are taken as the final
experts and a classifier network is then trained to predict the correct
specialty for a given test image patch. The proposed model achieves higher
count accuracy on major crowd datasets. Further, we analyse the characteristics
of specialties mined automatically by our method.

Bogoliubov quasiparticles around point nodes behave as Weyl fermions, and the
nodal direction represented by the $\ell$-vector may form a spatially modulated
texture. $\ell$-textures generate a chiral gauge field and a torsion field
directly acting on the chirality of Weyl-Bogoliubov quasiparticles. It has been
clarified by G. E. Volovik [Pi'sma Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. {\bf 43}, 428 (1986)]
that, if the $\ell$-vector is twisted, the chiral gauge field is responsible
for the chiral anomaly, leading to an anomalous current along ${\ell}$. Here we
show that, even for non-twisted $\ell$-vector fields, a torsion arising from
$\ell$-textures brings about contributions to the equilibrium currents of
Weyl-Bogoliubov quasiparticles along ${\rm curl}{\ell}$. This implies that
while the anomalous current appears only for the twisted (Bloch-type) skyrmion
of the $\ell$-vector, the extra mass current due to TCME always exists
regardless of the skyrmion type. Solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, we
demonstrate that both Bloch-type and N\'{e}el-type skyrmions induce chiral
fermion states with spectral asymmetry, and possess spatially inhomogeneous
structures of Weyl bands in the real coordinate space. Furthermore, we discuss
the contributions of Weyl-Bogoliubov quasiparticles and continuum states to the
mass current density in the vicinity of the topological phase transition. In
the weak coupling limit, continuum states give rise to backflow to the mass
current generated by Weyl-Bogoliubov quasiparticles, which makes a
non-negligible contribution to the orbital angular momentum. As the topological
transition is approached, the mass current density is governed by the
contribution of continuum states.

normals. In this paper we propose a novel energy term that acts as a prior, but
does not require any prior knowledge about the scene nor scene-specific
relationship among classes. It bootstraps from a coarse mapping of the 2D
segmentations on the mesh, and it favors the facets to be labeled according to
the statistics of the mesh normals in their neighborhood. We tested our
approach against five different datasets and, even if we do not inject prior
knowledge, our method adapts to the data and overcomes the state-of-the-art.

Lagrangian PKA1, we investigate the properties of the exotic nucleus 48Si. We
found that 48Si may be an atypical nucleus characterized by i) the onset of
doubly magicity, ii) its location at the drip line, iii) the presence of a
doubly semibubble (central depletion of the neutron and proton density
profiles) in the ground state, and iv) the occurrence of pairing reentrance at
finite temperature. These phenomenons are not independent from each others. We
illustrate for instance that the doubly semibubble reduces the spin-orbit
splitting of low-l orbitals and modifies the splitting of relevant pseudospin
partners, favoring N = 34 as a new magic number for neutron rich nuclei. Since
48Si is predicted doubly magic, it could have an extra stability which puts it
at the drip line. Moreover, 48Si may have interesting excited states which may
induce pairing reentrance at finite temperature. While not being new, these
phenomenons are found to serendipitously occur together in 48Si, from our
theoretical calculation. Theoretical nuclear modelings are known to be poorly
predictive in general, and we asset our confidence in the prediction of our
modeling on the fact that the predictions of PKA1 in various regions of the
nuclear chart have systematically been found correct and more specifically in
the region around 48Si, our approach correctly reproduce the known features of
neighboring nuclei. Whether our predictions are confirmed or not, 48Si provides
a concrete benchmark for the understanding of the nature of nuclear forces.

detector is believed to be radiated from a blazar. However, as the LIGO
collaboration first observed gravitational wave caused by spiral approach and
merging of two giant back holes, the IceCube did not see an excess of
cosmological neutrinos. The reason may be due to that the source is too far
away or the neutrino spectrum is not suitable for the IceCube facility
detection or just missing by chance. In this work, following Hawking's picture,
we suppose that neutrinos would be ejected from black holes as strong
gravitational effects lower the potential barriers to enhance neutrino escape
rate through quantum tunneling effects. We use the Dirac equation in the curved
spacetime to describe the neutrino status and estimate the rejection rate.
Then, we also adopt a simplified version where the effects of curved spacetime
is ignored to clarify the physical picture. Our conclusion is drawn based on

judges varies widely. In collaboration with the F\'ed\'eration Internationale
de Gymnastique (FIG) and Longines, we are designing and implementing an
improved statistical engine to analyze the performance of gymnastics judges
during and after major competitions like the Olympic Games and the World
Championships. The engine, called the Judge Evaluation Program (JEP), has three
objectives: (1) provide constructive feedback to judges, executive committees
and national federations; (2) assign the best judges to the most important
competitions; (3) detect bias and outright cheating.
  Using data from international gymnastics competitions held during the
2013-2016 Olympic cycle, we first develop a marking score evaluating the
accuracy of the marks given by gymnastics judges. Judging a gymnastics routine
is a random process, and we can model this process very accurately using
heteroscedastic random variables. The marking score scales the difference
between the mark of a judge and the theoretical performance of a gymnast as a
function of the standard deviation of the judging error estimated from data for
each apparatus. This dependence between judging variability and performance
quality has never been properly studied. We then study ranking scores assessing
to what extent judges rate gymnasts in the correct order, and explain why we
ultimately chose not to implement them. We also study outlier detection to
pinpoint gymnasts who were poorly evaluated by judges. Finally, we discuss
interesting observations and discoveries that led to recommendations and rule
changes at the FIG.

equivalent to key theorems of ordinary, non-set-theoretic mathematics. The main
philosophical application of reverse mathematics proposed thus far is
foundational analysis, which explores the limits of different foundations for
mathematics in a formally precise manner. This paper gives a detailed account
of the motivations and methodology of foundational analysis, which have
heretofore been largely left implicit in the practice. It then shows how this
account can be fruitfully applied in the evaluation of major foundational
approaches by a careful examination of two case studies: a partial realization
of Hilbert's program due to Simpson [1988], and predicativism in the extended
form due to Feferman and Sch\""{u}tte.
  Shore [2010, 2013] proposes that equivalences in reverse mathematics be
proved in the same way as inequivalences, namely by considering only
$\omega$-models of the systems in question. Shore refers to this approach as
computational reverse mathematics. This paper shows that despite some
attractive features, computational reverse mathematics is inappropriate for
foundational analysis, for two major reasons. Firstly, the computable
entailment relation employed in computational reverse mathematics does not
preserve justification for the foundational programs above. Secondly,
computable entailment is a $\Pi^1_1$ complete relation, and hence employing it
commits one to theoretical resources which outstrip those available within any
foundational approach that is proof-theoretically weaker than
$\Pi^1_1\text{-}\mathsf{CA}_0$.

using Langevin molecular dynamics, we show that non-local native interactions
help decreasing the escape time, and foldable proteins generally escape much
faster than same-length self-repulsive homopolymers at low temperatures. The
escape process, however, is slowed down by the local interactions that
stabilize the {\alpha}-helices. The escape time is found to increase with both
the tunnel length and the concentration of macromolecular crowders outside the

equation with an effective linear potential can be used to map out the escape
time distribution for various tunnel lengths and various crowder
concentrations. The consistency between the simulation data and the diffusion
model however is found only for the tunnel length smaller than a cross-over
length of 90 {\AA} to 110 {\AA}, above which the escape time increases much
faster with the tunnel length. It is suggested that the length of ribosomal
exit tunnel has been selected by evolution to facilitate both the efficient
folding and efficient escape of single domain proteins. We show that
macromolecular crowders lead to an increase of the escape time, and attractive
crowders are unfavorable for the folding of nascent polypeptide.

$\mathcal{O}(n\lambda\log \lambda+n^2)$ on two problems, LeadingOnes and

OneMax in expected time $\mathcal{O}(\lambda n)$, and for larger population

  We introduce a new sampling-based algorithm which uses the fast Fourier

than straightforward sampling. Typically, its complexity is logarithmic in the
input size, while the complexity of straightforward sampling is linear. The

In this work, we
perform 3D numerical simulations which mimic a vortex-type photospheric driver
with a Gaussian spatial profile. This driver is implemented to excite MHD waves
in an axially symmetric, 3D magnetic flux tube embedded in a realistic solar
atmosphere. The Gaussian width of the driver is varied and the resulting
perturbations are compared. Velocity vectors were decomposed into parallel,
perpendicular and azimuthal components with respect to pre-defined magnetic
flux surfaces. These components correspond broadly to the fast, slow and Alfven
modes, respectively. From these velocities the corresponding wave energy fluxes
are calculated, allowing us to estimate the contribution of each mode to the
energy flux. For the narrowest driver ($0.15$ Mm) the parallel component
accounts for $\sim 55 - 65\%$ of the flux. This contribution increases smoothly
with driver width up to nearly $90\%$ for the widest driver ($0.35$ Mm). The
relative importance of the perpendicular and azimuthal components decrease at
similar rates. The azimuthal energy flux varied between $\sim 35\%$ for the
narrowest driver and $< 10\%$ for the widest one. Similarly, the perpendicular
flux was $\sim 25 - 10\%$. We also demonstrate that the fast mode corresponds
to the sausage wave in our simulations. Our results therefore show that the
fast sausage wave is easily excited by this driver and that it carries the
majority of the energy transported. For this vortex-type driver the Alfven wave
does not contribute a significant amount of energy.

and synchronized swimming. With the notable exception of dressage, we identify,
for each aforementioned sport, a general and accurate pattern of the intrinsic

intrinsic judging inaccuracy is heteroscedastic and can be approximated by a
quadratic curve, indicating increased consensus among judges towards the best
athletes. Using this observation, the framework developed to assess the

distinguish cheating from unintentional misjudging. Our analysis also leads to
valuable insights about the judging practices of the sports under

irrespective of observables. The renormalon uncertainty of
$\mathcal{O}(\Lambda^4)$, which renders the gluon condensate ambiguous, is
separated from a perturbative calculation by using a recently suggested
analytic formulation. The renormalon uncertainty is absorbed into the gluon
condensate in the OPE, which makes the gluon condensate free from the
renormalon uncertainty. As a result, we can define the OPE in a renormalon-free
way. Based on this renormalon-free OPE formula, we discuss numerical extraction
of the gluon condensate using the lattice data of the energy density operator

Alexandra Range 97008 (LL3.05) meteorite. Based on its O and Mg isotopic
compositions, this 1.4 $\mu$m diameter grain formed in a low- or
intermediate-mass AGB star. It has four developed rhombohedral $\{$011$\}$
faces of corundum and a rough, rounded face with cavities. High Mg contents
(Mg/Al $>$ 0.004) are due to the decay of radioactive $^{26}$Al. No spinel
(MgAl$_{2}$O$_{4}$) inclusions that might have exsolved from the corundum are
observed, but there are several high-Mg domains with modulated structures. The
subhedral shape of grain QUE060 is the first clear evidence that corundum
condenses and grows to micrometer sizes in the extended atmospheres around AGB
stars. The flat faces indicate that grain QUE060 experienced little
modification by gas-grain and grain-grain collisions in the interstellar medium
(ISM) and solar nebula. The Mg distribution in its structure indicates that
grain QUE060 has not experienced any severe heating events since the exhaustion
of $^{26}$Al. However, it underwent at least one very transient heating event
to form the high-Mg domains. A possible mechanism for producing this transient
event, as well as the one rough surface and cavity, is a single grain-grain
collision in the ISM. These results indicate that grain QUE060 is the most
pristine circumstellar corundum studied to date.

uniformly during the hardening stage of the fracture initiation process, the
coupled fluid-solid problem is described by a nonlinear ordinary differential

with shooting and Newton methods. The finite difference code has also been

categories of boundary versus background in training data is one of main
reasons for the above problem. In this work, the aim is to make CNNs produce

boundary detection, which is very effective for classifying imbalanced data and
allows CNNs to produce crisp boundaries. Moreover, we propose an end-to-end
network which adopts the bottom-up/top-down architecture to tackle the task.
The proposed network effectively leverages hierarchical features and produces
pixel-accurate boundary mask, which is critical to reconstruct the edge map.

in a GaAs double quantum well (DQW). The structure consists of two quantum
wells (QWs) coupled by a thin tunnel barrier. The DQW is subject to a
transverse electric field to create spatially indirect inter-QW excitons with
electrons and holes located in different QWs. We show that the presence of
intra-QW charged excitons (trions) blocks carrier tunneling across the barrier
to form indirect excitons, thus opening a gap in their emission spectrum. This
behavior is attributed to the low binding energy of the trions. Within the
tunneling blockade regime, emission becomes dominated by processes involving
excitons bound to single shallow impurities, which behave as two-level centers
activated by resonant tunneling. The quantum nature of the emission is
confirmed by the anti-bunched photon emission statistics. The narrow
distribution of emission energies ($\sim 10$~meV) and the electrical connection
to the QWs make these single-exciton centers interesting candidates for
applications in single-photon sources.

highly relevant for model validation and predictive modelling, e.g., in systems
biology. Yet there are currently very few tools available that are able to
compute and visualise not only attractors but also their basins. In the realm
of asynchronous, non-deterministic modeling not only is the repertoire of
software even more limited, but also the formal notions for basins of
attraction are often lacking. In this setting, the difficulty both for theory
and computation arises from the fact that states may be ele- ments of several
distinct basins. In this paper we address this topic by partitioning the state
space into sets that are committed to the same attractors. These commitment
sets can easily be generalised to sets that are equivalent w.r.t. the long-term
behaviours of pre-selected nodes which leads us to the notions of markers and
phenotypes which we illustrate in a case study on bladder tumorigenesis. For
every concept we propose equivalent CTL model checking queries and an extension
of the state of the art model checking software NuSMV is made available that is
capa- ble of computing the respective sets. All notions are fully integrated as
three new modules in our Python package PyBoolNet, including functions for
visualising the basins, commitment sets and phenotypes as quotient graphs and
pie charts.

intention to avoid batch or weight normalization. The key step in SNNs is to
properly scale the exponential linear unit (referred to as SELU) to inherently
incorporate normalization based on central limit theory. SELU is a
monotonically increasing function, where it has an approximately constant
negative output for large negative input. In this work, we propose a new
activation function to break the monotonicity property of SELU while still
preserving the self-normalizing property. Differently from SELU, the new
function introduces a bump-shaped function in the region of negative input by
regularizing a linear function with a scaled exponential function, which is
referred to as a scaled exponentially-regularized linear unit (SERLU). The
bump-shaped function has approximately zero response to large negative input
while being able to push the output of SERLU towards zero mean statistically.
To effectively combat over-fitting, we develop a so-called shift-dropout for
SERLU, which includes standard dropout as a special case. Experimental results
on MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 show that SERLU-based neural networks provide
consistently promising results in comparison to other 5 activation functions

TDHF results are also confronted to Vlasov calculations, to explore up to which

response. The focus is on the low-energy response, below the Giant Dipole
Resonance region, where different modes of non negligible strength are
identified. We show that the relative weight of these excitations evolves with
nuclear global features, such as density profile and neutron skin, which in
turn reflect impor tant properties of the nuclear effective interaction. A
thorough analysis of the associated transition densities turns out to be quite
useful to better characterize the mixed isoscalar(IS)/isovector(IV) nature of
the different modes and their surface/volume components. In particular, we show
that the dipole response in the so-called Pygmy Dipole Resonance region
corresponds to isoscalar-like surface oscillations, of larger strength in
nuclei with a more diffuse surface. The ratio between the IV and IS Energy
Weighted Sum Rule fractions exhausted in this region is shown to almost
linearly increase with the neutron skin thickness in Sn isotopes.

the large model size and the intensive computation. To address this issue,
various approximation techniques have been investigated, which seek for a light
weighted network with little performance degradation in exchange of smaller
model size or faster inference. Both low-rankness and sparsity are appealing
properties for the network approximation. In this paper we propose a unified
framework to compress the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by combining
these two properties, while taking the nonlinear activation into consideration.
Each layer in the network is approximated by the sum of a structured sparse
component and a low-rank component, which is formulated as an optimization
problem. Then, an extended version of alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) with guaranteed convergence is presented to solve the
relaxed optimization problem. Experiments are carried out on VGG-16, AlexNet
and GoogLeNet with large image classification datasets. The results outperform
previous work in terms of accuracy degradation, compression rate and speedup
ratio. The proposed method is able to remarkably compress the model (with up to
4.9x reduction of parameters) at a cost of little loss or without loss on

this sense, we naturally wonder what is the minimum queueing delay when the

answer these two questions in the scenario where randomly arriving packets are
transmitted over multi-state wireless fading channel, a probabilistic
cross-layer scheduling policy is proposed in this paper, and characterized by a
constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). Using the steady-state probability
of the underlying Markov chain, we are able to derive the mathematical
expressions of the concerned metrics, namely, the average queueing delay and
the average power consumption. To describe the delay-power tradeoff, we
formulate a non-linear programming problem, which, however, is very challenging
to solve. By analyzing its structure, this optimization problem can be
converted into an equivalent Linear Programming (LP) problem via variable
substitution, which allows us to derive the optimal delay-power tradeoff as
well as the optimal scheduling policy. The optimal scheduling policy turns out
to be dual-threshold-based, which means transmission decisions should be made
based on the optimal thresholds imposed on the queue length and the channel
state.

functions are handled efficiently, as so many problems in computer vision and
machine learning are of this form.

tools. However, we contend that this paper presents an important datapoint: a
skilled programmer devoting roughly a week to each tool produced the timings we
present. We have made our implementations available as open source to allow the

concurrency model. Actor-based concurrency serialises all computations in an
actor through asynchronous message passing. In contrast, lock-based concurrency
serialises some computations by following a lock--unlock protocol for accessing
certain data. Both systems require sound reasoning about pointers and aliasing
to exclude data-races. If actor isolation is broken, so is the
single-thread-of-control abstraction. Similarly for locks, if a datum is
accessible outside of the scope of the lock, the datum is not governed by the
lock.
  In this paper we discuss how to balance aliasing and synchronisation. In
previous work, we defined a type system that guarantees data-race freedom of
actor-based concurrency and lock-based concurrency. This paper extends this
work by the introduction of two programming constructs; one for decoupling
isolation and synchronisation and one for constructing higher-level atomicity
guarantees from lower-level synchronisation. We focus predominantly on actors,
and in particular the Encore programming language, but our ultimate goal is to
define our constructs in such a way that they can be used both with locks and
actors, given that combinations of both models occur frequently in actual
systems. We discuss the design space, provide several formalisations of
different semantics and discuss their properties, and connect them to case
studies showing how our proposed constructs can be useful. We also report on an
on-going implementation of our proposed constructs in Encore.

sciences, ecology, etc. In order to uncover a latent structure in the data, a
popular approach consists in clustering individuals according to the observed
patterns of interactions. To do so, Stochastic block models (SBM) and Latent
Block models (LBM) are standard tools for clustering the individuals with
respect to their comportment in a unique network. However, when adopting an
integrative point of view, individuals are not involved in a unique network but
are part of several networks, resulting into a potentially complex multipartite
network. In this contribution, we propose a stochastic block model able to
handle multipartite networks, thus supplying a clustering of the individuals
based on their connection behavior in more than one network. Our model is an
extension of the latent block models (LBM) and stochastic block model (SBM).
The parameters -- such as the marginal probabilities of assignment to blocks
and the matrix of probabilities of connections between blocks -- are estimated
through a variational Expectation-Maximization procedure. The numbers of blocks
are chosen with the Integrated Completed Likelihood criterion, a penalized
likelihood criterion. The pertinence of our methodology is illustrated on two

integral spectrometer in the energy range 20-80 MeV. We have developed a new
method based on precise modeling, that is applied to measurements of $^{26}$Al
(half-life ~0.7 megayears) in lunar samples from the Apollo mission, and
present the first direct reconstruction (i.e., without any a priori
assumptions) of the mean energy spectrum of solar and galactic energetic
particles over a million of years. Results. We show that the reconstructed
spectrum of solar energetic particles is totally consistent with that over the
last decades, despite the very different levels of solar modulation of galactic
cosmic rays ($\phi=496\pm 40$ MV over a million years versus $\phi= 660\pm 20$
MV for the modern epoch). We also estimated the occurrence probability of
extreme solar events and argue that no events with the F(>30 MeV) fluence
exceeding $5*10^{10}$ and $10^{11}$ cm$^2$ are expected on timescales of a
thousand and million years, respectively. Conclusions. We conclude that the
mean flux of solar energetic particles hardly depends on the level of solar
activity, in contrast to the solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays. This
puts new observational constraints on solar physics and becomes important for
assessing radiation hazards for the planned space missions.

hundreds and thousands of nodes within an acceptable amount of time. Meanwhile,
because transformation map can preserve graph structures, a domain

correspondences between functions defined on the shapes by extending the

Previous approaches using the functional map for this task find the functional
correspondences matrix by solving a non-linear optimization problem which makes
them slow. In this work, we propose a closed form solution for this matrix
which makes our approach faster. We find the closed-form solution based on our
following results. If the given shape is intrinsically symmetric, then the
shortest length geodesic between two intrinsically symmetric points is also
intrinsically symmetric. If an eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator
for the given shape is an even (odd) function, then its restriction on the
shortest length geodesic between two intrinsically symmetric points is also an
even (odd) function. The sign of a low-frequency eigenfunction is the same on
the neighboring points. Our method is invariant to the ordering of the

  Power Spectrum","13 pages, 14 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stz1514",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We use data from the first-year (Y1) observations of the DES collaboration to
measure the galaxy angular power spectrum (APS), and search for its BAO feature
using a template-fitting method. We test our methodology in a sample of 1800
DES Y1-like mock catalogs. The APS is measured with the pseudo-$C_\ell$ method,
using pixelized maps constructed from the mock catalogs and the DES mask. The
covariance matrix of the $C_\ell$'s in these tests are also obtained from the
mock catalogs. We use templates to model the measured spectra and estimate
template parameters firstly from the $C_\ell$'s of the mocks using two
different methods, a maximum likelihood estimator and a MCMC, finding
consistent results with a good reduced $\chi^2$. Robustness tests are performed
to estimate the impact of different choices of settings used in our analysis.
After these tests on mocks, we apply our method to a galaxy sample constructed
from DES Y1 data specifically for LSS studies. This catalog comprises galaxies
within an effective area of 1318 deg$^2$ and $0.6<z<1.0$. We fit the observed
spectra with our optimized templates, considering models with and without BAO
features. We find that the DES Y1 data favors a model with BAO at the
$2.6\,\sigma$ C.L. with a best-fit shift parameter of $\alpha=1.023\pm 0.047$.
However, the goodness-of-fit is somewhat poor, with $\chi^2/$(dof) = 1.49. We
identify a possible cause of this issue and show that using a theoretical
covariance matrix obtained from $C_\ell$'s that are better adjusted to data
results in an improved value of $\chi^2/$(dof) = 1.36 which is similar to the
value obtained with the real-space analysis. Our results correspond to a
distance measurement of $D_A(z_{\rm eff} = 0.81)/r_d = 10.65 \pm 0.49$,
consistent with the main DES BAO findings. This is a companion paper to the
main DES BAO article showing the details of the harmonic space analysis.

particular, PAMELA can measure for the first time with good accuracy the
spectral features at moderate and high energies, providing important
constraints for current SEP models. In addition, the PAMELA observations allow
the relationship between low and high-energy particles to be investigated,
enabling a clearer view of the SEP origin. No qualitative distinction between
the spectral shapes of GLE, sub-GLE and non-GLE events is observed, suggesting
that GLEs are not a separate class, but are the subset of a continuous
distribution of SEP events that are more intense at high energies. While the
spectral forms found are to be consistent with diffusive shock acceleration
theory, which predicts spectral rollovers at high energies that are attributed
to particles escaping the shock region during acceleration, further work is
required to explore the relative influences of acceleration and transport
processes on SEP spectra.

developed as an experimental test for macroscopic realism, and serves as a
witness of quantum coherence in isolated quantum systems by comparing the
quantum state to its completely dephased counterpart. We show that it provides
a lower bound on a certain resource-theoretic coherence monotone. We go on to
generalise the protocol to the case where the system of interest is coupled to
an environment. Depending on the manner of the generalisation, the resulting
witness either reports on system coherence alone, or on a disjunction of system
coherence with either (i) the existence of non-classical system-environment

of the E and B mode power spectra of dust emission in the interstellar medium
(ISM). The positive cross-correlation between the total dust intensity, T, with
the B modes has raised new questions about the physical mechanisms that affect
dust polarization, such as the Galactic magnetic-field structure. This is key
both to better understanding ISM dynamics and to accurately describing Galactic
foregrounds to the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). In
this theoretical paper we investigate the possibility that the observed
cross-correlations in the dust polarization power spectra, and specifically
between T and B, can be related to a parity-odd quantity in the ISM such as the
magnetic helicity. We produce synthetic dust polarization data, derived from 3D
analytical toy models of density structures and helical magnetic fields, to
compare with the E and B modes of observations. Focusing on the observed T-B
correlation, we propose a new line of interpretation of the Planck observations
based on a large-scale helical component of the Galactic magnetic field in the
solar neighborhood. Our analysis shows that: I) the sign of magnetic helicity
does not affect E and B modes for isotropic magnetic-field configurations; II)
helical magnetic fields threading interstellar filaments cannot reproduce the
Planck results; III) a weak helical left-handed magnetic field structure in the
solar neighborhood may explain the T-B correlation seen in the Planck data.
This work suggests a new perspective for the interpretation of the dust
polarization power spectra, which strongly supports the imprint of a
large-scale structure of the Galactic magnetic field in the solar neighborhood.

aims to maximize the uplink ergodic sum-rate (SR) by jointly optimizing
quantization noise matrix and bandwidth allocation between radio access

computational complexity and communication overhead, we introduce an
approximation problem of the joint optimization problem based on
large-dimensional random matrix theory, which is a slow time-scale issue
because it only depends on statistical channel information. Finally, an

a framework with less computational complexity to study how bandwidth

minimizer of the PCMS model can be obtained by thresholding the minimizer of

under specific assumptions. Thus it opens a new segmentation paradigm: image
segmentation can be done via image restoration plus thresholding. This new
paradigm, which circumvents the innate non-convex property of the PCMS model,
therefore improves the segmentation performance in both efficiency (much faster
than state-of-the-art methods based on PCMS model, particularly when the phase
number is high) and effectiveness (producing segmentation results with better
quality) due to the flexibility of the ROF model in tackling degraded images,
such as noisy images, blurry images or images with information loss. As a
by-product of the new paradigm, we derive a novel segmentation method, called

explosions and predict observables for various scenarios resulting from
differentially rotating carbon-oxygen white dwarfs close to their respective

synthetic observables from our models. We find that all explosion scenarios
involving detonations produce very bright events. The observables predicted for
them, however, are inconsistent with any known subclass of Type Ia supernovae.
Pure deflagrations resemble 2002cx-like supernovae and may contribute to this

research has aimed at speeding up processing, the approaches are still lacking
from a principled, art historical standpoint: a style is more than just a
single image or an artist, but previous work is limited to only a single
instance of a style or shows no benefit from more images. Moreover, previous
work has relied on a direct comparison of art in the domain of RGB images or on
CNNs pre-trained on ImageNet, which requires millions of labeled object
bounding boxes and can introduce an extra bias, since it has been assembled
without artistic consideration. To circumvent these issues, we propose a
style-aware content loss, which is trained jointly with a deep encoder-decoder
network for real-time, high-resolution stylization of images and videos. We
propose a quantitative measure for evaluating the quality of a stylized image
and also have art historians rank patches from our approach against those from
previous work. These and our qualitative results ranging from small image
patches to megapixel stylistic images and videos show that our approach better
captures the subtle nature in which a style affects content.

expanding circumstellar envelopes is studied with the aim of easing their
analysis in terms of physics models. The arguments developed rest on the remark
that, in principle, when the wind velocity distribution is known, the effective
emissivity can be calculated at any point in space. The paper provides a
detailed study of how much this is true in practice. The wind velocity
distribution assumed to be axi-symmetric and in expansion, is described by four
parameters: the angles defining the orientation of the symmetry axis, an
overall velocity scale and a parameter measuring the elongation (prolateness)
of the distribution. Tools are developed that allow for measuring, or at least
constraining, each of the four parameters. The use of effective emissivity as
relevant quantity, rather than temperature and density being considered
separately, implies important assumptions and simplifications meaning that the
approach being considered here is only a preliminary to, and by no means a
replacement for, a physics analysis accounting for radiative transfer and
hydrodynamics arguments. While most considerations are developed using
simulated observations as examples, two case studies (EP Aqr, observed with
ALMA, and RS Cnc, with NOEMA) are presented that illustrate their usefulness in
practical cases.

and effective. ELM randomly generates input weights and biases in the hidden
layer, and then calculates and computes the output weights by reducing the
iterative solution to the problem of linear equations. Therefore, ELM offers
the satisfying classification performance and fast training time than other
discriminative models in tracking. However, the original ELM method often
suffers from the problem of the imbalanced classification distribution, which
is caused by few target objects, leading to under-fitting and more background
samples leading to over-fitting. Worse still, it reduces the robustness of
tracking under special conditions including occlusion, illumination, etc. To
address above problems, in this paper, we present a robust tracking algorithm.
First, we introduce the local weight matrix that is the dynamic creation from
the data distribution at the current frame in the original ELM so as to balance
between the empirical and structure risk, and fully learn the target object to
enhance the classification performance. Second, we improve it to the
incremental learning method ensuring tracking real-time and efficient. Finally,
the forgetting factor is used to strengthen the robustness for changing of the
classification distribution with time. Meanwhile, we propose a novel optimized
method to obtain the optimal sample as the target object, which avoids tracking
drift resulting from noisy samples. Therefore, our tracking method can fully
learn both of the target object and background information to enhance the
tracking performance, and it is evaluated in 20 challenge image sequences with
different attributes including illumination, occlusion, deformation, etc.,
which achieves better performance than several state-of-the-art methods in
terms of effectiveness and robustness.

  An interesting new finding is that in order to accelerate any subatomic

needs two Planck masses of initial load. This might sound illogical until one
understands that subatomic particles with different masses have different
maximum velocities. This can be generalized to large rockets and gives us the

information technologies, and continue to do so as we move into the realm of
quantum technologies. In this course we review the basics of magnetism and
quantum mechanics, before going into more advanced subjects. Magnetism is
intrinsically quantum mechanical in nature, and magnetic ordering can only be
explained by use of quantum theory. We will go over the interactions and the
resulting Hamiltonian that governs magnetic phenomena, and discuss its
elementary excitations, denominated magnons. After that we will study
magneto-optical effects and derive the classical Faraday effect. We will then
move on to the quantization of the electric field and the basics of optical
cavities. This will allow us to understand a topic of current research
denominated Cavity Optomagnonics. These notes were written as the accompanying
material to the course I taught in the Summer Semester 2018 at the
Friedrich-Alexander University in Erlangen. The course is intended for Master
or advanced Bachelor students. Basic knowledge of quantum mechanics,
electromagnetism, and solid state at the Bachelor level is assumed. Each
section is followed by a couple of simple exercises which should serve as to

perspective of dimension analysis. According to characteristics of the n-body
system with point masses $(m_1,m_2,...,m_n)$, the gravitational field
parameter, $\alpha \sim Gm_im_j$, the n-body system reduction mass $M_n$, and
the area, $A_n$, of the periodic orbit are selected as the basic parameters,
while the period, $T_n$, and the system energy, $|E_n|$, are expressed as the
three basic parameters. Using the Buckingham $\pi$ theorem, We obtained an epic
result, by working with a reduced gravitation parameter $\alpha_n$, then
predicting a dimensionless relation $T_n|E_n|^{3/2}=\text{const} \times
\alpha_n \sqrt{\mu_n}$ ($\mu_n$ is reduced mass). The
const$=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}$ is derived by matching with the 2-body Kepler's
third law, and then a surprisingly simple relation for Kepler's third law of an
n-body system is derived by invoking a symmetry constraint inspired from
Newton's gravitational law: $T_n|E_n|^{3/2}=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}
G\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=i+1}^n(m_im_j)^3}{\sum_{k=1}^n

third law of 2-body system, but yields a non-trivial prediction of the Kepler's

network accelerators by taking advantage of the high efficiency on
vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) operations. However, in the case of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the efficiency is compromised
dramatically due to the large amounts of data reuse. Although some mapping
methods have been designed to achieve a balance between the execution
throughput and resource overhead, the resource consumption cost is still huge
while maintaining the throughput.
  Network pruning is a promising and widely studied leverage to shrink the
model size. Whereas, previous work didn`t consider the crossbar architecture
and the corresponding mapping method, which cannot be directly utilized by
crossbar-based neural network accelerators. Tightly combining the crossbar
structure and its mapping, this paper proposes a crossbar-aware pruning
framework based on a formulated L0-norm constrained optimization problem.
Specifically, we design an L0-norm constrained gradient descent (LGD) with
relaxant probabilistic projection (RPP) to solve this problem. Two grains of
sparsity are successfully achieved: i) intuitive crossbar-grain sparsity and
ii) column-grain sparsity with output recombination, based on which we further
propose an input feature maps (FMs) reorder method to improve the model
accuracy. We evaluate our crossbar-aware pruning framework on median-scale
CIFAR10 dataset and large-scale ImageNet dataset with VGG and ResNet models.
Our method is able to reduce the crossbar overhead by 44%-72% with little
accuracy degradation. This work greatly saves the resource and the related
energy cost, which provides a new co-design solution for mapping CNNs onto
various crossbar devices with significantly higher efficiency.

imperfect real-world images requires reliable methods for preprocessing,
detection and extraction of the cells. We propose several methods for those
tasks, which, however, can be modified to related imaging problems where
similar geometric objects need to be detected accurately. Allowing for images
taken under difficult outdoor conditions, we present methods to correct for
rotation and perspective distortions. The next important step is the extraction
of the solar cells of a PV module, for instance to pass them to a procedure to
detect and analyze defects on their surface. We propose a method based on
specialized Hough transforms, which allows to extract the cells even when the
module is surrounded by disturbing background and a fast method based on
cumulated sums (CUSUM) change detection to extract the cell area of single-cell
mini-module, where the correction of perspective distortion is implicitly done.
The methods are highly automatized to allow for big data analyses. Their
application to a large database of EL images substantiates that the methods
work reliably on a large scale for real-world images. Simulations show that the
approach achieves high accuracy, reliability and robustness. This even holds
for low contrast images as evaluated by comparing the simulated accuracy for a
low and a high contrast image.

line-of-sight links. With the flourishing Internet of Things, several types of
new applications are emerging. In this paper, we focus on bandwidth hungry and
delay-tolerant applications where multiple pairs of transceivers require the
support of UAVs to complete their transmissions. To do so, the UAVs have the
possibility to employ two different bands namely the typical microwave and the
high-rate millimeter wave bands. In this paper, we develop a generic framework
to assign UAVs to supported transceivers and optimize their trajectories such
that a weighted function of the total service time is minimized. Taking into
account both the communication time needed to relay the message and the flying
time of the UAVs, a mixed non-linear programming problem aiming at finding the
stops at which the UAVs hover to forward the data to the receivers is
formulated. An iterative approach is then developed to solve the problem.
First, a mixed linear programming problem is optimally solved to determine the
path of each available UAV. Then, a hierarchical iterative search is executed
to enhance the UAV stops' locations and reduce the service time. The behavior
of the UAVs and the benefits of the proposed framework are showcased for
selected scenarios.
