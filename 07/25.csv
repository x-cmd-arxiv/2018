(DNN) at different stages of training is an unsolved challenge. Though
practitioners typically ignore this problem, a non-trivial data scheduling
method may result in a significant improvement in both convergence and
generalization performance. In this paper, we introduce Self-Paced Learning
with Adaptive Deep Visual Embeddings (SPL-ADVisE), a novel end-to-end training
protocol that unites self-paced learning (SPL) and deep metric learning (DML).
We leverage the Magnet Loss to train an embedding convolutional neural network
(CNN) to learn a salient representation space. The student CNN classifier
dynamically selects similar instance-level training examples to form a
mini-batch, where the easiness from the cross-entropy loss and the true
diverseness of examples from the learned metric space serve as sample
importance priors. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SPL-ADVisE, we use deep
CNN architectures for the task of supervised image classification on several
coarse- and fine-grained visual recognition datasets. Results show that, across
all datasets, the proposed method converges faster and reaches a higher final
accuracy than other SPL variants, particularly on fine-grained classes.

attention for their robustness, small size of required population, and
efficiency in terms of number of function evaluations (NFE). In this paper, the
performances and behaviors of OMEAs are studied by investigating the mechanism
of optimal mixing (OM), the variation operator in OMEAs, under two scenarios --
one-layer and two-layer masks. For the case of one-layer masks, the required
population size is derived from the viewpoint of initial supply, while the
convergence time is derived by analyzing the progress of sub-solution growth.
NFE is then asymptotically bounded with rational probability by estimating the
probability of performing evaluations. For the case of two-layer masks,
empirical results indicate that the required population size is proportional to
both the degree of cross competition and the results from the one-layer-mask
case. The derived models also indicate that population sizing is decided by
initial supply when disjoint masks are adopted, that the high selection
pressure imposed by OM makes the composition of sub-problems impact little on
NFE, and that the population size requirement for two-layer masks increases
with the reverse-growth probability.

that the up- and down-spin conductance contributions may have a very different

This leads to a subgap %EM2 added spin-split conductance peak in the total
conductance. This peak behavior, which can be prominent also in $N/F/S$
systems, is strongly dependent, in a periodic way, on the thickness of the
intermediate ferromagnetic layer. We study this phenomenon using a numerical
self consistent method, with additional insights gained from an approximate
analytic calculation for an infinite $N/F/S$ structure. We study also the
angular dependence on the relative magnetization angle between $F_1$ and $F_2$
of both the spin-split and the total conductance. We do so for realistic
material parameters and layer thicknesses relevant to experimental studies on
these devices. We also find that the spin-split conductance is highly dependent
on the interfacial scattering in these devices, and we carefully include these
effects for realistic systems. A strong valve-effect is found for the angularly
dependent subgap peak conductance that is largely independent on the scattering

MaxFS has two main limitations for geometric model fitting. First, its
performance is much influenced by the user-specified inlier scale. Second, it
is computationally inefficient for large data. The presented MaxFS-based
algorithm iteratively estimates model parameters and inlier scale and also
overcomes the second limitation by reducing data for the MaxFS problem. Further
it generates hypotheses only with top-n ranked subsets based on matching scores
and data fitting residuals. This reduction of data for the MaxFS problem makes
the algorithm computationally realistic. Our method, called iterative MaxFS
with inlier scale estimation and subset updating (IMaxFS-ISE-SU) in this paper,
performs hypothesis generation and fitting alternately until all of true
structures are found. The IMaxFS-ISE-SU algorithm generates substantially more
reliable hypotheses than random sampling-based methods especially as
(pseudo-)outlier ratios increase. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method can generate more reliable and consistent hypotheses than random
sampling-based methods for estimating multiple structures from data with many

development of different modalities and personalized medicine can greatly
improve the accuracy of outcome prediction, they also bring the three mainly
simultaneous challenges including multi-modality, multi-classifier and
multi-criteria, which are summarized as multifactorial outcome prediction
(MFOP) in this paper. Compared with traditional outcome prediction, MFOP is a
more generalized problem. To handle this novel problem, based on the recent
proposed radiomics, we propose a new unified framework termed as multifaceted
radiomics (M-radiomics). M-radiomics trains multiple modality-specific
classifiers first and then optimally combines the output from the outputs of
different classifiers which are trained according to multiple different
criteria such as sensitivity and specificity. It considers multi-modality,
multi-classifier and multi-criteria into a unified framework, which makes the
prediction more accurate. Furthermore, to obtain the more reliable predictive
performance which is to maximize the similarity between predicted output and
labelled vector, a new validation set based reliable fusion (VRF) strategy and
reliable optimization models as well as a new recursive two stage hybrid
optimization algorithm (RTSH) were also developed. Two clinical problems for
predicting distant metastasis and locoregional recurrence in head & neck cancer
were investigated to validate the performance and reliability of the proposed
M-radiomics. By using the proposed RF strategy and RTSH optimization algorithm,
the experimental results demonstrated that M-radiomics performed better than
current radiomic models that rely on a single objective, modality or
classifier.

distortion in that spatial curvature. He further proposed that matter in motion
is not more than the simple variation in space of this distortion. In this
work, we conjecture that Clifford went further than his aforementioned
proposals, as he tried to show that matter effectively curves space. For this
purpose he made an unsuccessful observation on the change of the plane of
polarization of the skylight during the solar eclipse of December 22, 1870 in
Sicily.

sensing of magnetic noises compared with the estimation of deterministic
magnetic fields, such as the different dependences on the spin decoherence, the
different optimal measurement schemes, the absence of the modulo-2\pi phase

different models of the comparison process lead to different shrinkage

dimensional adaptive quadrature to calculate the resulting Hankel transform,
decreasing the computation required for kernel generation by several orders of
magnitude, whilst preserving the accuracy. We confirm that the radial
$w$-projection kernel is accurate to approximately 1% by imaging the
zero-spacing with an added $w$-term. We demonstrate the potential of our
radially symmetric $w$-projection kernel via sparse image reconstruction, using
the software package PURIFY. We develop a distributed $w$-stacking and
$w$-projection hybrid algorithm. We apply this algorithm to individually
correct for non-coplanar effects in 17.5 million visibilities over a $25$ by

level of accuracy and scalability is not possible with standard $w$-projection

characterize those sources and produce a dense rotation measure (RM) grid to
probe magneto-ionized structures along the line of sight via Faraday rotation.
The aim of the paper is to develop a computationally efficient and rigorously
defined source-finding algorithm for linearly polarized sources. We used a
calibrated data set from the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) at 150 MHz centered on
the nearby galaxy M51 to search for polarized background sources. With a new
imaging software, we re-imaged the field at a resolution of 18''x15'' and
cataloged a total of about 3000 continuum sources within 2.5 degrees of the
center of M51. We made small Stokes Q and U images centered on each source
brighter than 100 mJy in total intensity (201 sources) and used RM synthesis to
create corresponding Faraday cubes that were analyzed individually. For each
source, the noise distribution function was determined from a subset of
measurements at high Faraday depths where no polarization is expected; the
peaks in polarized intensity in the Faraday spectrum were identified and the
p-value of each source was calculated. Finally, the false discovery rate method
was applied to the list of p-values to produce a list of polarized sources and
quantify the reliability of the detections. We also analyzed sources fainter
than 100 mJy but that were reported as polarized in the literature at at least
another radio frequency. Of the 201 sources that were searched for
polarization, 6 polarized sources were detected confidently (with a false
discovery rate of 5 percent). This corresponds to a number density of 1

(GR) are classified into those breaking fundamental assumptions, containing
additional fields and massive graviton(s). In addition to Lagrangian based
theories we present the effective theory of DE and the $\mu$-$\Sigma$

Multi-messenger GW detections can be used to measure the cosmological expansion
(standard sirens), providing an independent test of the DE equation of state
and measuring the Hubble parameter. Several key tests of gravity involve the
cosmological propagation of GWs, including anomalous GW speed, massive graviton
excitations, Lorentz violating dispersion relation, modified GW luminosity
distance and additional polarizations, which may also induce GW oscillations.
We summarize present constraints and their impact on DE models, including those
arising from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. Upgrades of LIGO-Virgo
detectors to design sensitivity and the next generation facilities such as LISA

method. The detection system consists of eight LaBr3 scintillators and a
tungsten collimator, mounted on a rotating frame. Custom electronics and
calibration algorithms have been developed for the measurement of energy- and
time-resolved gamma-ray spectra during proton irradiation at a clinical dose
rate. Using experimentally determined nuclear reaction cross sections and a

range of the proton pencil-beams is determined by minimizing the discrepancy
between the measurement and this model, leaving the absolute range of the beam
and the elemental concentrations of the irradiated matter as free parameters.
The system was characterized in a clinical-like situation by irradiating
different phantoms with a scanning pencil-beam. A dose of 0.9 Gy was delivered
to a 5x10x10 cm$^3$ target with a beam current of 2 nA incident on the phantom.
Different range shifters and materials were used to test the robustness of the
verification method and to calculate the accuracy of the detected range. The
absolute proton range was determined for each spot of the distal energy layer
with a mean statistical precision of 1.1 mm at a 95% confidence level and a
mean systematic deviation of 0.5 mm, when aggregating pencil-beam spots within
a cylindrical region of 10 mm radius and 10 mm depth. Small range errors that
we introduced were successfully detected and even large differences in the
elemental composition do not affect the range verification accuracy. These
results show that our system is suitable for range verification during patient

combining plasmon hybridization theory with transformation optics, which yields
an efficient way of simultaneously controlling both global and local features

metasurface whose absorption spectrum can be controlled over a large class of
complex patterns through only a few geometric parameters in an intuitive way.

reconstruction from a single image, and generation of new 3D shape samples.
These tasks have received considerable attention recently; however, existing
approaches rely on 3D supervision, annotation of 2D images with keypoints or
poses, and/or training with multiple views of each object instance. Our
framework is very general: it can be trained in similar settings to these
existing approaches, while also supporting weaker supervision scenarios.
Importantly, it can be trained purely from 2D images, without ground-truth pose
annotations, and with a single view per instance. We employ meshes as an output
representation, instead of voxels used in most prior work. This allows us to
exploit shading information during training, which previous 2D-supervised
methods cannot. Thus, our method can learn to generate and reconstruct concave
object classes. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data in various settings,
showing that (i) it learns to disentangle shape from pose; (ii) using shading
in the loss improves performance; (iii) our model is comparable or superior to
state-of-the-art voxel-based approaches on quantitative metrics, while
producing results that are visually more pleasing; (iv) it still performs well
when given supervision weaker than in prior works.

advantage of the mapping of quantum circuits to the dynamics of interacting

cosmic-ray diffusion to be locally suppressed by a factor of ~100-1000 compared
to the typical interstellar medium. No model currently explains this
suppression. We show that cosmic-ray self-confinement can significantly inhibit
diffusion near pulsars. The steep cosmic-ray gradient generates Alfven waves
that resonantly scatter the same cosmic-ray population, suppressing diffusion
within ~20 pc of pulsars younger than ~100 kyr. In this model, TeV halos evolve
through two phases, a growth phase where Alfven waves are resonantly generated
and cosmic-ray diffusion becomes increasingly suppressed, and a subsequent
relaxation phase where the diffusion coefficient returns to the standard
interstellar value. Intriguingly, cosmic-rays are not strongly confined early
in the TeV halo evolution, allowing a significant fraction of injected e+e- to
escape. If these e+e- also escape from the surrounding supernova remnant, they
would provide a natural explanation for the positron excess observed by PAMELA
and AMS-02. Recently created TeV cosmic-rays are confined in the TeV halo,
matching observations by HAWC and H.E.S.S. While our default model relaxes too
rapidly to explain the confinement of TeV cosmic rays around mature pulsars,
such as Geminga, models utilizing a Kraichnan turbulence spectrum experience
much slower relaxation. Thus, observations of TeV halos around mature pulsars

line abundances reveals no link between central star surface chemistry and
nebular abundance discrepancy, but a clear link between binarity and the
abundance discrepancy, as well as an anticorrelation between abundance
discrepancies and nebular electron densities: all nebulae with a binary central
star with a period of less than 1.15 days have an abundance discrepancy factor
exceeding 10, and an electron density less than $\sim$1000 cm$^{-3}$; those

upturn is significantly diminished in the $z=0.7$ cluster, implying that the
stellar population responsible for the upturn in a typical red sequence galaxy
is only just developing at this redshift and is essentially fully-developed by
$\sim 1$ Gyr later. Of all the mainstream models that seek to explain the UV
upturn phenomenon, it is those that generate the upturn through the presence of
a Helium-enhanced stellar subpopulation on the (hot) horizontal branch that are
most consistent with this behaviour. The epoch ($z=0.7$) where the stars
responsible for the upturn first evolve from the red giant branch places
constraints on their age and chemical abundances. By comparing our results with
the prediction made by the YEPS Helium-enhanced spectrophotometic models, we
find that a solar metallicity sub-population that displays a consistent upturn
between $0<z<0.55$ but then fades by $z=0.7$ would require a Helium abundance
of $Y\geqslant0.45$, if formed at $z_f\sim4$. Later formation redshifts and/or
higher metallicity would further increase the Helium enhancement required to
produce the observed upturn in these clusters and vice versa.

all-optical spin injection into graphene. In this study, we present a
microscopic theory of spin dynamics in weakly disordered graphene samples

A time-dependent perturbative treatment is employed to derive spin Bloch
equations governing the spin dynamics at high electronic density. Various
scenarios are predicted, depending on a delicate competition between
interface-induced Bychkov-Rashba and spin--valley (Zeeman-type) interactions
and the ratio of intra- to inter-valley scattering rates. For weak SOC compared
to the disorder-induced quasiparticle broadening, the anisotropy ratio of
out-of-plane to in-plane spin lifetimes
$\zeta=\tau_{s}^{\perp}/\tau_{s}^{\parallel}$ agrees qualitatively with a toy
model of spins in a weak fluctuating SOC field recently proposed by Cummings

the sample, we investigate the alignment between the mass and light

well-aligned, except when there is strong external shear. However, we find no
correlation between the ellipticity of the light and mass distributions. We
also show that the observed flux-ratios between the images depart significantly
from the predictions of simple smooth models. The departures are strongest in
the bluest band, consistent with microlensing being the dominant cause in
addition to millilensing. Future papers will exploit this rich dataset in
combination with ground based spectroscopy and time delays to determine
quantities such as the Hubble constant, the free streaming length of dark

including the effect of radiative cooling, thermal conduction, and an ionizing
background characteristic of a starbursting galaxy. Using a new analysis tool,
Trident, we estimate the equilibrium column density distributions for ten
different ions: H I, Mg II, C II, C III, C IV, Si III, Si IV, N V, O VI, and Ne

maximum column density and coverage, and for each ion we provide a table of
these fit parameters, along with average velocities and line widths. Our
results are most sensitive to Mach number and conduction efficiency, with
higher Mach numbers and more efficient conduction leading to more compact, high
column density clouds. We use our results to interpret down-the-barrel
observations of outflows and find that the adopted ionization equilibrium model
overpredicts column densities of ions such as Si IV and does not adequately
capture the observed trends for N V and O VI, implying the presence of strong

of Bloch electrons, but the resulting formulas are often large and unwieldy,
involving many energy denominators from intermediate states. This work gives a
Feynman diagram approach to calculating non-linear responses. This diagrammatic
method is a systematic way to perform perturbation theory, which often offers
shorter derivations and also provides a natural interpretation of nonlinear
responses in terms of physical processes. Applying this method to second-order
responses concisely reproduces formulas for the second-harmonic, shift current.
We then apply this method to third-order responses and derive formulas for
third-harmonic generation and self-focusing of light, which can be directly
applied to tight-binding models. Third-order responses in the semiclasscial
regime include a Berry curvature quadrupole term, whose importance is discussed
including symmetry considerations and when the Berry curvature quadrupole
becomes the leading contribution. The method is applied to compute third-order

necessary to distribute the data across multiple machines. We consider a
likelihood function expressed as a product of terms, each associated with a
subset of the data. Inspired by global variable consensus optimisation, we
introduce an instrumental hierarchical model associating auxiliary statistical
parameters with each term, which are conditionally independent given the
top-level parameters. One of these top-level parameters controls the
unconditional strength of association between the auxiliary parameters. This
model leads to a distributed MCMC algorithm on an extended state space yielding
approximations of posterior expectations. A trade-off between computational
tractability and fidelity to the original model can be controlled by changing
the association strength in the instrumental model. We further propose the use
of a SMC sampler with a sequence of association strengths, allowing both the
automatic determination of appropriate strengths and for a bias correction
technique to be applied. In contrast to similar distributed Monte Carlo
algorithms, this approach requires few distributional assumptions. The
performance of the algorithms is illustrated with a number of simulated
examples.

long standing challenge. Bayesian neural networks have been proposed as a
solution, but it remains open how to specify their prior. In particular, the
common practice of an independent normal prior in weight space imposes
relatively weak constraints on the function posterior, allowing it to
generalize in unforeseen ways on inputs outside of the training distribution.
We propose noise contrastive priors (NCPs) to obtain reliable uncertainty
estimates. The key idea is to train the model to output high uncertainty for
data points outside of the training distribution. NCPs do so using an input
prior, which adds noise to the inputs of the current mini batch, and an output
prior, which is a wide distribution given these inputs. NCPs are compatible
with any model that can output uncertainty estimates, are easy to scale, and
yield reliable uncertainty estimates throughout training. Empirically, we show
that NCPs prevent overfitting outside of the training distribution and result
in uncertainty estimates that are useful for active learning. We demonstrate
the scalability of our method on the flight delays data set, where we
significantly improve upon previously published results.

be controlled by coupling the network an external bath. We conclude by pointing
out specific applications of the quantum simulator, e.g., spin liquids, quantum

regularization where the renormalization scale is treated as a dynamical field.
But, rather than be regarded as a novel regularization method on par with

nonrenormalizable models of certain type. The subset realizes the demand that
renormalization scale, along with any other dimensionful parameters, should be
interpreted as a dynamical field's homogeneous background. This restriction is
most straightforwardly implemented using dimensional regularization but it can
hypothetically be imposed with any regularization method. Theories that satisfy
it offer a new perspective on the radiative violation of global scale symmetry
associated with RGE functions. As a result of the quantum scale invariant
regularization being implemented, the scale symmetry is preserved at the
quantum level despite the RGE functions being non-zero, as can be inspected at
the level of composite quantum operators that govern dilatation of Green

either vanishing electric field or current density. The centrifugal force has
an effect on the solutions, but only if its magnitude with respect to

either by an explicit cooling term or enhanced radiative diffusion, is more
important than the thermal boundary condition. In particular, runs with cooling
tend to lead to more anisotropic convection and stronger deviations from the

circularizes quickly to form an accretion disk of size about twice the orbital
pericenter of the star. Most TDEs and candidates discovered in the optical/UV
have broad optical emission lines with complex and diverse profiles of puzzling
origin. Liu et al. recently developed a relativistic elliptical disk model of
constant eccentricity in radius for the broad optical emission lines of TDEs
and well reproduced the double-peaked line profiles of the TDE candidate
PTF09djl with a large and extremely eccentric accretion disk. In this paper, we
show that the optical emission lines of the TDE ASASSN-14li with radically
different profiles are well modelled with the relativistic elliptical disk
model, too. The accretion disk of ASASSN-14li has an eccentricity 0.97 and
semimajor axis of 847 times the Schwarzschild radius (r_S) of the black hole
(BH). It forms as the consequence of tidal disruption of a star passing by a
massive BH with orbital pericenter 25r_S. The optical emission lines of
ASASSN-14li are powered by an extended X-ray source of flat radial distribution
overlapping the bulk of the accretion disk and the single-peaked asymmetric
line profiles are mainly due to the orbital motion of the emitting matter
within the disk plane of inclination about 26\degr and of pericenter
orientation closely toward the observer. Our results suggest that modelling the
complex line profiles is powerful in probing the structures of accretion disks
and coronal X-ray sources in TDEs.

in combination with previously-published proper motion membership
determinations, we identify a clean, representative sample of cluster white
dwarfs, including 13 members with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, at least one
of which is a candidate double degenerate, and 5 members with helium-dominated
atmospheres. Using this sample we test multiple predictions surrounding the
final stages of stellar evolution in solar type stars. In particular, the
stochasticity of the integrated mass lost by ~1.5 solar mass stars is less than
7% of the white dwarf remnant mass. We identify white dwarfs likely resulting
from binary evolution, including at least one blue straggler remnant and two
helium core white dwarfs. We observe no evidence of a significant population of
helium core white dwarfs formed by enhanced mass loss on the red giant branch
of the cluster. The distribution of white dwarf atmospheric compositions is
fully consistent with that in the field, limiting proposed mechanisms for the
suppression of helium atmosphere white dwarf formation in star clusters. In
short, the white dwarf population of Messier 67 is fully consistent with basic
predictions of single- and multiple-star stellar evolution theories for solar

the results with a small delay between any two consecutive results. Our goal is
to have an algorithm which is tractable in combined complexity, i.e., in the
sizes of the input document and the VA; while ensuring the best possible data
complexity bounds in the input document size, i.e., constant delay in the
document size. Several recent works at PODS'18 proposed such algorithms but
with linear delay in the document size or with an exponential dependency in
size of the (generally nondeterministic) input VA. In particular, Florenzano et
al. suggest that our desired runtime guarantees cannot be met for general
sequential VAs. We refute this and show that, given a nondeterministic
sequential VA and an input document, we can enumerate the mappings of the VA on
the document with the following bounds: the preprocessing is linear in the
document size and polynomial in the size of the VA, and the delay is
independent of the document and polynomial in the size of the VA. The resulting
algorithm thus achieves tractability in combined complexity and the best
possible data complexity bounds. Moreover, it is rather easy to describe, in

system to protect it from the environment. A crucial step is to use natural,
low-weight operations with an ancilla to extract information about errors
without causing backaction on the encoded system. Essentially, ancilla errors
must not propagate to the encoded system and induce errors beyond those which
can be corrected. The current schemes for achieving this fault-tolerance to
ancilla errors come at the cost of increased overhead requirements. An
efficient way to extract error syndromes in a fault-tolerant manner is by using
a single ancilla with strongly biased noise channel. Typically, however,
required elementary operations can become challenging when the noise is
extremely biased. We propose to overcome this shortcoming by using a
bosonic-cat ancilla in a parametrically driven nonlinear cavity. Such a
cat-qubit experiences only bit-flip noise and is stabilized against
phase-flips. To highlight the flexibility of this approach, we illustrate the
syndrome extraction process in a variety of codes such as qubit-based toric
codes, bosonic cat- and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. Our results open
a path for realizing hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant error syndrome

to measure the evolution of dark energy by measuring subtle distortions of

a crucial step to accurate measurements of weak gravitational lensing.
Atmospheric contributions dominate the LSST PSF. Simulations of Kolmogorov
turbulence models are commonly used to characterize and correct for these
atmospheric effects. In order to validate these simulations, we compare the
predicted atmospheric behavior to empirical data. The simulations are carried
out in GalSim, an open-source software package for simulating images of
astronomical objects and PSFs. Atmospheric simulations are run by generating
large phase screens at varying altitude and evolving them over long time
scales. We compare the turbulence strength and temporal behavior of atmospheres
generated from simulations to those from reconstructed telemetry data from the
Gemini Planet Imager (GPI). GPI captures a range of spatial frequencies by
sampling the atmosphere with 18-cm subapertures. The LSST weak lensing analysis
will measure correlations of galaxy ellipticity, requiring very accurate
knowledge of the magnitude and correlations of PSF shape parameters. Following
from the first analysis, we use simulations and sequential short exposure
observations from the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI) to study
the behavior of PSF parameters - e.g., ellipticity and size - as a function of
exposure time. These studies could help inform discussions of possible variable
exposure times for LSST visits for example, to provide more uniform depth of
visits.

the generated observations and the transition in the planning model, we obtain
a low-dimensional representation that best explains the causal nature of the

the existence of edge modes with conductance approaching the quantized value.
Here, we directly image the local conductivity of monolayer WTe2 devices using
microwave impedance microscopy, establishing beyond doubt that conduction is
indeed strongly localized to the physical edges at temperatures up to 77 K and
above. The edge conductivity shows no gap as a function of gate voltage, ruling
out trivial conduction due to band bending or in-gap states, and is suppressed
by magnetic field as expected. Interestingly, we observe additional conducting
lines and rings within most samples which can be explained by edge states
following boundaries between topologically trivial and non-trivial regions.
These observations will be critical for interpreting and improving the
properties of devices incorporating WTe2 or other air-sensitive 2D materials.

optimization through repeatedly encoding gradients. Our approach generalizes
standard inference models in VAEs and provides insight into several empirical
findings, including top-down inference techniques. We demonstrate the inference
optimization capabilities of iterative inference models and show that they
outperform standard inference models on several benchmark data sets of images

decisions under uncertainty. We formulate a discrete submodular maximization
problem for selecting a set using Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a risk
metric commonly used in financial analysis. While CVaR has recently been used
in optimization of linear cost functions in robotics, we take the first stages
towards extending this to discrete submodular optimization and provide several
positive results. Specifically, we propose the Sequential Greedy Algorithm that
provides an approximation guarantee on finding the maxima of the CVaR cost
function under a matroidal constraint. The approximation guarantee shows that
the solution produced by our algorithm is within a constant factor of the
optimal and an additive term that depends on the optimal. Our analysis uses the
curvature of the submodular set function, and proves that the algorithm runs in
polynomial time. This formulates a number of combinatorial optimization
problems that appear in robotics. We use two such problems, vehicle assignment
under uncertainty for mobility-on-demand and sensor selection with failures for
environmental monitoring, as case studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our
formulation.

the optimal estimation of information encoded into the weight and phase

Moreover, it is shown that the post-measurement plays the role of a quantum key
for manifestation of the Unruh effect. On the other hand, investigating the
phase estimation optimization and assuming that there is no control over the
initial state, we show that the weak measurements may be utilized to match the
optimal $ \vartheta $ to its predetermined value. Moreover, in addition to
determination of a lower bound on the QFI with the local quantum uncertainty,
we unveil an important upper bound on the precision of phase estimation in our

overall precision of 540 ppb by the E821 experiment at BNL. Since the
publication of this result in 2004 there has been a persistent tension of 3.5
standard deviations with the theoretical prediction of a_mu based on the
Standard Model. The uncertainty of the latter is dominated by the effects of
the strong interaction, notably the hadronic vacuum polarisation (HVP) and the
hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering contributions, which are commonly
evaluated using a data-driven approach and hadronic models, respectively. Given
that the discrepancy between theory and experiment is currently one of the most
intriguing hints for a possible failure of the Standard Model, it is of
paramount importance to determine both the HVP and HLbL contributions from
first principles. In this review we present the status of lattice QCD
calculations of the leading-order HVP and the HLbL scattering contributions,
a_mu^hvp and a_mu^hlbl. After describing the formalism to express a_mu^hvp and
a_mu^hlbl in terms of Euclidean correlation functions that can be computed on
the lattice, we focus on the systematic effects that must be controlled to
achieve a first-principles determination of the dominant strong interaction
contributions to a_mu with the desired level of precision. We also present an
overview of current lattice QCD results for a_mu^hvp and a_mu^hlbl, as well as
related quantities such as the transition form factor for pi0 -> gamma*gamma*.
While the total error of current lattice QCD estimates of a_mu^hvp has reached
the few-percent level, it must be further reduced by a factor 5 to be
competitive with the data-driven dispersive approach. At the same time, there
has been good progress towards the determination of a_mu^hlbl with an
uncertainty at the 10-15%-level.

computes on that data.
  To date, implementations of faceted execution are relatively heavyweight:
requiring either changing the language runtime or the application code (e.g.,
by using monads). Following Racket's languages-as-libraries approach, we
present Racets: an implementation of faceted execution as a library of macros.
Given Racket's highly-expressive macro system, our implementation follows
relatively directly from the semantics of faceted execution. To demonstrate how
Racets can be used for policy-agnostic programming, we use it to build a
web-based game of Battleship. Our implementation sheds light on several
interesting issues in interacting with code written without faceted execution.
Our Racets implementation is open source, under development, and available
online.

to use such perturbations within a novel contrastive learning setup to build
negative samples, which are then used to produce improved video
representations. To this end, given a well-trained deep model for per-frame
video recognition, we first generate adversarial noise adapted to this model.
Positive and negative bags are produced using the original data features from
the full video sequence and their perturbed counterparts, respectively. Unlike
the classic contrastive learning methods, we develop a binary classification
problem that learns a set of discriminative hyperplanes -- as a subspace --
that will separate the two bags from each other. This subspace is then used as
a descriptor for the video, dubbed \emph{discriminative subspace pooling}. As
the perturbed features belong to data classes that are likely to be confused
with the original features, the discriminative subspace will characterize parts
of the feature space that are more representative of the original data, and
thus may provide robust video representations. To learn such descriptors, we
formulate a subspace learning objective on the Stiefel manifold and resort to
Riemannian optimization methods for solving it efficiently. We provide
experiments on several video datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.

log-concave densities defined on $\mathbb R^p$. The present work focuses on
this framework and studies the behavior of Monte Carlo algorithms based on
discretizations of the kinetic Langevin diffusion. We first prove the geometric
mixing property of the kinetic Langevin diffusion with a mixing rate that is,
in the overdamped regime, optimal in terms of its dependence on the condition

using the kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo method, when the quality of sampling is
measured by the Wasserstein distance. We also consider the situation where the

In this case, we introduce a new discretization of the kinetic Langevin

$f_{\mathbf{A},\mathbf{b}}(x) := \frac{1}{2}x^\top \mathbf{A} x - \langle
\mathbf{b}, x \rangle$ for $\mathbf{A} \succ 0 $ is a fundamental problem in
machine learning and optimization. In this work, we prove gradient-query
complexity lower bounds for minimizing convex quadratic functions which apply
to both deterministic and \emph{randomized} algorithms. Specifically, for
$\kappa > 1$, we exhibit a distribution over $(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{b})$ with
condition number $\mathrm{cond}(\mathbf{A}) \le \kappa$, such that any
\emph{randomized} algorithm requires $\Omega(\sqrt{\kappa})$ gradient queries
to find a solution $\hat x$ for which $\|\hat x - \mathbf x_\star\| \le
\epsilon_0\|\mathbf{x}_{\star}\|$, where $\mathbf x_{\star} =
\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{b}$ is the optimal solution, and $\epsilon_0$ a small
constant. Setting $\kappa =1/\epsilon$, this lower bound implies the minimax
rate of $T = \Omega(\lambda_1(\mathbf{A})\|\mathbf
x_\star\|^2/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ queries required to minimize an arbitrary convex
quadratic function up to error $f(\hat{x}) - f(\mathbf x_\star) \le \epsilon$.
  Our lower bound holds for a distribution derived from classical ensembles in
random matrix theory, and relies on a careful reduction from adaptively
estimating a planted vector $\mathbf u$ in a deformed Wigner model. A key step
in deriving sharp lower bounds is demonstrating that the optimization error
$\mathbf x_\star - \hat x$ cannot align too closely with $\mathbf{u}$. To this
end, we prove an upper bound on the cosine between $\mathbf x_\star - \hat x$
and $\mathbf u$ in terms of the MMSE of estimating the plant $\mathbf u$ in a
deformed Wigner model. We then bound the MMSE by carefully modifying a result
due to Lelarge and Miolane 2016, which rigorously establishes a general
replica-symmetric formula for planted matrix models.

resolution that is adaptive to a wide range of compression ratios (CRs), which
is infeasible with existing methods. Experimental results on multiple public

unique shortest paths and trees, as well as provide matching inapproximability
lower bounds for the problem in its most general settings. Finally, we
demonstrate a connection between computing a Hub Labeling on a tree and
searching for a node in a tree.
  In the second part of the thesis, we turn to beyond worst case analysis and
extensively study the stability model introduced by Bilu and Linial in an
attempt to describe real-life instances of graph partitioning and clustering
problems. Informally, an instance of a combinatorial optimization problem is
stable if it has a unique optimal solution that remains the unique optimum
under small multiplicative perturbations of the parameters of the input.
Utilizing the power of convex relaxations for stable instances, we obtain
several results for problems such as Edge/Node Multiway Cut, Independent Set

problems such as $k$-center and $k$-median and the symmetric Traveling Salesman
problem. We also provide strong lower bounds for certain families of algorithms

avoids the obstacles and is optimal with respect to some measure or a
combination of measures, for example an $u$-to-$v$ shortest path of clearance
at least $c$, where $u$ and $v$ are points in the free space and $c$ is a
positive constant. In practical applications, such as emergency
interventions/evacuations and medical treatment planning, a number of
$u$-to-$v$ paths are suggested by experts and the question is whether such
paths satisfy specific requirements, such as a given clearance from the
obstacles. We address the following path query problem: Given a set $S$ of $m$
disjoint simple polygons in the plane, with a total of $n$ vertices, preprocess
them so that for a query consisting of a positive constant $c$ and a simple
polygonal path $\pi$ with $k$ vertices, from a point $u$ to a point $v$ in free
space, where $k$ is much smaller than $n$, one can quickly decide whether $\pi$
has clearance at least $c$ (that is, there is no polygonal obstacle within
distance $c$ of $\pi$). To do so, we show how to solve the following related
problem: Given a set $S$ of $m$ simple polygons in $\Re^{2}$, preprocess $S$
into a data structure so that the polygon in $S$ closest to a query line
segment $s$ can be reported quickly. We present an $O(t \log n)$ time, $O(t)$
space preprocessing, $O((n / \sqrt{t}) \log ^{7/2} n)$ query time solution for
this problem, for any $n ^{1 + \epsilon} \leq t \leq n^{2}$. For a path with

PK) using simulations of the Three Interaction Site (TIS) model for RNA. The
heat capacity from TIS model simulations, calculated using temperature replica
exchange simulations, reproduces nearly quantitatively the available
experimental data for the hTR HP. The corresponding results for BWYV PK serve
as predictions. We calculated the folding rates ($k_\mathrm{F}$) from more than
100 folding trajectories for each value of the solvent viscosity ($\eta$) at a
fixed salt concentration of 200 mM. By using the theoretical estimate
($\propto$$\sqrt{N}$ where $N$ is the number of nucleotides) for folding free
energy barrier, $k_\mathrm{F}$ data for both the RNAs are quantitatively fit
using one-dimensional Kramers' theory with two parameters specifying the
curvatures in the unfolded basin and the barrier top. In the high-friction
regime ($\eta\gtrsim10^{-5}\,\textrm{Pa\ensuremath{\cdot}s}$), for both HP and
PK, $k_\mathrm{F}$s decrease as $1/\eta$ whereas in the low friction regime,
$k_\mathrm{F}$ values increase as $\eta$ increases, leading to a maximum
folding rate at a moderate viscosity
($\sim10^{-6}\,\textrm{Pa\ensuremath{\cdot}s}$), which is the Kramers turnover.
From the fits, we find that the speed limit to RNA folding at water viscosity
is between 1 and 4 $\mathrm{\mu s}$, which is in accord with our previous
theoretical prediction as well as results from several single molecule
experiments. Both the RNA constructs fold by parallel pathways. Surprisingly,
we find that the flux through the pathways could be altered by changing solvent
viscosity, a prediction that is more easily testable in RNA than in proteins.

often singular, and extensions beyond such singularities are necessary, before
studying asymptotic properties of such spacetimes at the null infinity of the

related to the studies of memory effects and soft graviton theorems. In this
paper, we point out that in the BJR coordinates all the spacetimes are singular
physically at the focused point $u = u_s$, except for the two cases: (1)
$\alpha =1/2, \; \forall \; \chi_n$; and (2) $\alpha =1, \; \chi_i = 0\; (i =
1, 2, 3)$, where $\chi_n$ are the coefficients in the expansion $\chi \equiv

u_s\right)^{\alpha}\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}\chi_n \left(u - u_s\right)^n$ with
$\chi_0 \not= 0$, the constant $\alpha \in (0, 1]$ characterizes the strength
of the singularities, and $g_{ab}$ denotes the reduced metric on the
two-dimensional plane orthogonal to the propagation direction of the wave.
Therefore, the hypersurfaces $u= u_s$ already represent the boundaries of such
spacetimes, and the null infinity does not belong to them. As a result, they
cannot be used to study properties of plane gravitational waves at null
infinities, including memory effects and soft graviton theorems.

for in vivo dosimetry in HDR brachytherapy. Methods: An exhaustive analysis was
carried out in order to obtain an optimized mPSD design that maximize the
scintillation light collection produced by the interaction of ionizing photons.
Several mPSD prototypes were built and tested in order to determine the
appropriate order of scintillators relative to the photodetector, as well as
their length as a function of the scintillation light emitted. Scintillators
BCF-60, BCF-12 and BCF-10 constituted the mPSD sensitive volume.Each
scintillator contribution to the total spectrum was determined by irradiations
in the low energy range.For the best mPSD design, a numerical optimization was
done in order to select the optical components that better match the light
emission profile. The optimized dosimetric system was used for HDR
brachytherapy dose determination. The system performance was quantified in term
of signal to noise ratio and signal to background ratio. Results: It was
determined that BCF-60 should be placed at the distal position, BCF-12 in the
center and BCF-10 at proximal position with respect to the photodetector.This
configuration allowed for optimized light transmission through the collecting
fiber, avoiding inter-scintillator excitation and self-absorption effects.The
optimized luminescence system allowed for signal deconvolution using a
multispectral approach, extracting the dose to each element while taking into
account Cerenkov stem effect.Differences between the mPSD measurements and
TG-43 remain below 5%. In all measurement conditions, the system was able to
properly differentiate the produced scintillation signal from the background
one. Conclusions: A mPSD was constructed and optimized for HDR brachytherapy
dosimetry, enabling real time dose determination, up to 6.5cm from the 192Ir
source.

protons in the ICM has yet to be established. Performing particle-in-cell

development of a nonthermal particle population in weak shocks in high $\beta$

plasma waves via CR-driven instabilities, and multiple cycles of shock drift
acceleration are essential to the early acceleration of CR protons in
supercritical quasi-parallel shocks. We find that only in ICM shocks with
$M_{\rm s} \gtrsim M_{\rm s}^*\approx 2.25$, a sufficient fraction of incoming
protons are reflected by the overshoot in the shock electric potential and
magnetic mirror at locally perpendicular magnetic fields, leading to efficient
excitation of magnetic waves via CR streaming instabilities and the injection
into the DSA process. Since a significant fraction of ICM shocks have $M_{\rm

than previously expected. This may explain why the diffuse gamma-ray emission

starting from an arbitrary node; 2) learning a classifier on the nodes in the

step provides the information necessary to make inferences over the nodes and
edges, while the adjustment step corrects for classifier bias in estimating
group proportions. This process provides de-biased estimates at the cost of
additional variance. We evaluate AdjustedWalk on four tasks: the proportion of
nodes belonging to a minority group, the proportion of the minority group among
high degree nodes, the proportion of within-group edges, and Coleman's
homophily index. Simulated and empirical graphs show that this procedure
performs well compared to optimal baselines in a variety of circumstances,

their winds and redistributed towards longer wavelengths. This effect, which
leads also to the heating of the stellar photosphere, is termed wind
blanketing. For stars with variable winds, the effect of wind blanketing may
lead to the photometric variability. We have studied the consequences of line
driven wind instability and wind blanketing for the light variability of O
stars. We combined the results of wind hydrodynamic simulations and of global
wind models to predict the light variability of hot stars due to the wind
blanketing and instability. The wind instability causes stochastic light
variability with amplitude of the order of tens of millimagnitudes and a
typical timescale of the order of hours for spatially coherent wind structure.
The amplitude is of the order of millimagnitudes when assuming that the wind
consists of large number of independent concentric cones. The variability with
such amplitude is observable using present space borne photometers. We show
that the simulated light curve is similar to the light curves of O stars

random sampling which produce varying results especially when outlier ratio is

are regarded as outliers when multiple structures are present. Global
optimization has recently been investigated to provide stable and unique
solutions, but the computational cost of the algorithms is prohibitively high
for most image data with reasonable sizes. The algorithm presented in this
paper uses a maximum feasible subsystem (MaxFS) algorithm to generate
consistent initial hypotheses only from partial datasets in spatially
overlapping local image regions. Our assumption is that each genuine structure
will exist as a dominant structure in at least one of the local regions. To
refine initial hypotheses estimated from partial datasets and to remove
residual tolerance dependency of the MaxFS algorithm, iterative re-weighted L1
(IRL1) minimization is performed for all the image data. Initial weights of
IRL1 framework are determined from the initial hypotheses generated in local
regions. Our approach is significantly more efficient than those that use only
global optimization for all the image data. Experimental results demonstrate
that the presented method can generate more reliable and consistent hypotheses
than random-sampling methods for estimating single and multiple structures from
data with a large amount of outliers. We clearly expose the influence of
algorithm parameter settings on the results in our experiments.

microwave background observation and weak gravitational lensing effect in
galaxy imaging survey opens a new window on constraining matter contents in the
Universe at redshift less than 1. In this paper, we study the impact of radio
sources and cosmic infrared background (CIB) on observed tSZ-lensing
correlation. Assuming the best-fit model of CIB by the Planck satellite, we
estimate that the residual correlation of CIB with large-scale structures will
be of an order of $2\%$ of expected tSZ-lensing correlation from intracluster
medium in current lensing surveys. On the other hand, despite large model
uncertainties, we find that correlation of lensing and radio sources can induce
a negative correction for the observed tSZ-lensing correlation with a
$\sim10-30\%$ level. This is originated from positive cross correlation with
radio sources and lensing at $\sim100\, {\rm GHz}$ frequency, whereas
tSZ-lensing correlation should show a negative value in temperature
fluctuations at that frequency. We also show that the negative correction by
radio-lensing correlation can solve the tension between recent measurements of
tSZ-lensing correlation and an expected signal from ""universal"" gas pressure
profile of nearby galaxy clusters, when the radio sources with flat-spectral
index are assumed to populate massive cluster-sized dark matte halos. Our

promising technology to address the radio spectrum shortage. In particular,
sensing of Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, a widely
accepted multi-carrier transmission paradigm, has received paramount interest.
Despite various efforts, most conventional OFDM sensing methods suffer from
noise uncertainty, timing delay and carrier frequency offset (CFO) that
significantly degrade the sensing accuracy. To address these challenges, this
work develops two novel OFDM sensing frameworks drawing support from deep
learning networks. Specifically, we first propose a stacked autoencoder based
spectrum sensing method (SAE-SS), in which a stacked autoencoder network is
designed to extract the inherent features of OFDM signals. Using these features
to classify the OFDM user's activities, SAE-SS is much more robust to noise
uncertainty, timing delay, and CFO than the conventional OFDM sensing methods.
Moreover, SAE-SS doesn't require any prior information of signals (e.g., signal
structure, pilot tones, cyclic prefix) which are essential for the conventional
feature-based OFDM sensing methods. To further improve the sensing accuracy of
SAE-SS, especially under low SNR conditions, we propose a stacked autoencoder
based spectrum sensing method using time-frequency domain signals (SAE-TF).
SAE-TF achieves higher sensing accuracy than SAW-SS at the cost of higher
computational complexity. Extensive simulation results show that both SAE-SS
and SAE-TF can achieve significantly higher sensing accuracy, compared with
state of the art approaches that suffer from noise uncertainty, timing delay
and CFO.

stability is a crucial factor for our civilization. The dynamic stability of a
power grid is usually quantified by the probability of its nodes' recovery to
phase synchronization of the alternating current it carries, in response to
external perturbation. Intuitively, the stability of nodes in power grids is
supposed to become more robust as the coupling strength between the nodes
increases. However, we find a counterintuitive range of coupling strength
values where the synchronization stability suddenly droops as the coupling
strength increases, on a number of simple graph structures. Since power grids
are designed to fulfill both local and long-range power demands, such simple
graph structures or graphlets for local power transmission are indeed relevant
in reality. We show that the observed nonmonotonic behavior is a consequence of
transitions in multistability, which are related to changes in stability of the
\emph{unsynchronized} states. Therefore, our findings suggest that a
comprehensive understanding of changes in multistability are necessary to
prevent the unexpected catastrophic instability in the building blocks of power
grids.

largest draws (i.e. 5% and 95% quantiles), but not as strong as the correlation

use state space models (Hidden Markov Models) of volatility to investigate
volatility spill overs between exchange rates. Among the currency pairs, the
co-movement of EUR/USD and CHF/USD volatility states show the strongest
observed relationship. With the use of transfer entropy, we find evidence for
information flows between the volatility state series of AUD, CAD and BRL. The
third study uses the entropy of S&P realised volatility in detecting changes of

the entropy of market volatility, to measure the dynamic of hedge funds equity
exposure. On a cross section of around 2500 hedge funds with a focus on the US

adjust their exposure dynamically in response to changes in volatility regime.

translation (MT) system is usually evaluated by automatic metric BLEU when the
golden references are provided for validation. However, for model inference or
production deployment, the golden references are prohibitively available or
require expensive human annotation with bilingual expertise. In order to
address the issue of quality evaluation (QE) without reference, we propose a
general framework for automatic evaluation of translation output for most WMT
quality evaluation tasks. We first build a conditional target language model
with a novel bidirectional transformer, named neural bilingual expert model,
which is pre-trained on large parallel corpora for feature extraction. For QE
inference, the bilingual expert model can simultaneously produce the joint
latent representation between the source and the translation, and real-valued
measurements of possible erroneous tokens based on the prior knowledge learned
from parallel data. Subsequently, the features will further be fed into a
simple Bi-LSTM predictive model for quality evaluation. The experimental
results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the
quality estimation track of WMT 2017/2018.

bipartite mixed states, defined by the minimum of the relative entropy
$S(\rho_{AB}|| \sigma_{AB})$ between a given mixed state $\rho_{AB}$ and an
arbitrary separable state $\sigma_{AB}$. The REE is always bounded by the
mutual information $I_{AB}=S(\rho_{AB} || \rho_{A}\otimes \rho_{B})$ because
the latter measures not only quantum entanglement but also classical
correlations. In this paper we address the question of to what extent REE can
be small compared to the mutual information in conformal field theories (CFTs).
For this purpose, we perturbatively compute the relative entropy between the
vacuum reduced density matrix $\rho^{0}_{AB}$ on disjoint subsystems $A \cup B$
and arbitrarily separable state $\sigma_{AB}$ in the limit where two subsystems
A and B are well separated, then minimize the relative entropy with respect to
the separable states. We argue that the result highly depends on the spectrum
of CFT on the subsystems. When we have a few low energy spectrum of operators
as in the case where the subsystems consist of a finite number of spins in spin
chain models, the REE is considerably smaller than the mutual information.
However in general our perturbative scheme breaks down, and the REE can be as
large as the mutual information.

identifies redundant tiles early in the graphics pipeline, it completely avoids

for spaceflight (referred to as the CosmOrbitrap), coupled with a commercial
pulsed UV laser source (266 nm), is shown to successfully characterize a
variety of planetary analog samples via ultrahigh resolution laser
desorption/ablation mass spectrometry. The materials analyzed in this study
include: jarosite (a hydrous sulfate detected on Mars); magnesium sulfate (a
potential component of the subsurface ocean on Europa); uracil (a nucleobase of
RNA); and a variety of amino acids. RESULTS: The instrument configuration
tested here enables: measurement of major elements and organic molecules with
ultrahigh mass resolution (m/{\Delta}m higher than 120,000, FWHM);
quantification of isotopic abundances with 1.0% (2{\sigma}) precision; and,
identification of highly accurate masses within 3.2 ppm of absolute values. The
analysis of a residue of a dilute solution of amino acids demonstrates the
capacity to detect twelve amino acids in positive ion mode at concentrations as
low as 1 pmol/mm2 while maintaining mass resolution and accuracy requirements.
CONCLUSIONS: The CosmOrbitrap mass analyzer is highly sensitive and delivers
mass resolution/accuracy unmatched by any instrument sent into orbit or
launched into deep space. This prototype instrument, which maps to a
spaceflight implementation, represents a missionenabling technology capable of
advancing planetary exploration for decades to come.

preclude the fitting of a logistic regression on all subjects, CART is
appealing in part because some implementations allow for incomplete records to
be incorporated in the tree fitting and provide propensity score estimates for
all subjects. Based on theoretical considerations, we argue that the automatic
handling of missing data by CART may however not be appropriate. Using a series
of simulation experiments, we examined the performance of different approaches
to handling missing covariate data; (i) applying the CART algorithm directly to
the (partially) incomplete data, (ii) complete case analysis, and (iii)
multiple imputation. Performance was assessed in terms of bias in estimating
exposure-outcome effects \add{among the exposed}, standard error, mean squared
error and coverage. Applying the CART algorithm directly to incomplete data
resulted in bias, even in scenarios where data were missing completely at
random. Overall, multiple imputation followed by CART resulted in the best
performance. Our study showed that automatic handling of missing data in CART
can cause serious bias and does not outperform multiple imputation as a means
to account for missing data.

find that while the $Z_{2}$ and the $U(1)$ spin liquid state have a large

foiled by checking channel state information (CSI). Existing CSI-based
authentication algorithms mostly require a deep knowledge of the channel to
deliver decent performance. In this paper, we investigate CSI-based
authenticators that can spare the effort to predetermine channel properties by
utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs). We first propose a convolutional neural
network (CNN)-enabled authenticator that is able to extract the local features
in CSI. Next, we employ the recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the
dependencies between different frequencies in CSI. In addition, we propose to
use the convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN)---a combination of the
CNN and the RNN---to learn local and contextual information in CSI for user
authentication. To effectively train these DNNs, one needs a large amount of
labeled channel records. However, it is often expensive to label large channel
observations in the presence of a spoofer. In view of this, we further study a
case in which only a small part of the the channel observations are labeled. To
handle it, we extend these DNNs-enabled approaches into semi-supervised ones.
This extension is based on a semi-supervised learning technique that employs
both the labeled and unlabeled data to train a DNN. To be specific, our
semi-supervised method begins by generating pseudo labels for the unlabeled
channel samples through implementing the K-means algorithm in a semi-supervised
manner. Subsequently, both the labeled and pseudo labeled data are exploited to
pre-train a DNN, which is then fine-tuned based on the labeled channel records.

jet mass response is measured with two methods: using mass peaks formed by $W$
bosons and top quarks with large transverse momenta and by comparing the jet
mass measured using the energy deposited in the calorimeter with that using the
momenta of charged-particle tracks. The transverse momentum and mass responses
in simulations are found to be about 2-3% higher than in data. This difference
is adjusted for with a correction factor. The results of the different methods
are combined to yield a calibration over a large range of transverse momenta
($p_{\rm T}$). The precision of the relative jet energy scale is 1-2% for
$200~{\rm GeV} < p_{\rm T} < 2~{\rm TeV}$, while that of the mass scale is

antigen-specific lymphocytes during an immune reaction to form a large pool of
effector cells. This proliferation must be regulated to ensure an effective
response to infection while avoiding immunopathology. Recent experiments in
mice have demonstrated that the expansion of a specific clone of T cells in
response to cognate antigen obeys a striking inverse power law with respect to
the initial number of T cells. Here, we show that such a relationship arises
naturally from a model in which T cell expansion is limited by decaying levels
of presented antigen. The same model also accounts for the observed dependence
of T cell expansion on affinity for antigen and on the kinetics of antigen
administration. Extending the model to address expansion of multiple T cell
clones competing for antigen, we find that higher affinity clones can suppress
the proliferation of lower affinity clones, thereby promoting the specificity
of the response. Employing the model to derive optimal vaccination protocols,
we find that exponentially increasing antigen doses can achieve a nearly
optimized response. We thus conclude that the dynamics of presented antigen is
a key regulator of both the size and specificity of the adaptive immune
response.

flow in ideal and nonideal relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we use
appropriate symmetry arguments, and determine the evolution of magnetic fields
arising from the $3+1$ dimensional self-similar and Gubser flows in an
infinitely conductive relativistic fluid (ideal MHD). In the case of the $3+1$
dimensional self-similar flow, we arrive at a family of solutions, that are
related through a differential equation arising from the corresponding Euler
equation. To find the magnetic field evolution from the Gubser flow, we solve
the MHD equations of a stationary fluid in a conformally flat $dS^{3}\times
E^{1}$ spacetime. The results are then Weyl transformed back into the Minkowski
spacetime. In this case, the temporal evolution of the resulting magnetic field
is shown to exhibit a transition between an early time $1/t$ decay to a
$1/t^{3}$ decay at a late time. Here, $t$ is the time coordinate. Transverse
and longitudinal components of the magnetic fields arising from these flows are
also found. The latter turns out to be sensitive to the transverse size of the
fluid. In contrast to the result arising from the Gubser flow, the radial
domain of validity of the magnetic field arising from the self-similar flow is
highly restricted. A comparison of the results suggests that the (conformal)
Gubser MHD may give a more appropriate qualitative picture of the magnetic
field decay in the plasma of quarks and gluons created in heavy ion collisions.

molecular clouds of mass $2\times 10^6$ M$_\odot$ and virial parameters ranging

processes such as winds from massive stars or feedback from High Mass X-ray
binaries (HMXBs), contrasting the impulsive energy injection from supernovae
(SNe). For stars with a mass high enough that their lifetime is shorter than
the life of the cloud, we include a SN feedback prescription. Including both
effects, we investigate the interplay between slow and fast forms of feedback
and their effectiveness at triggering/suppressing star formation. We find that
SN feedback can carve low density chimneys in the gas, offering a path of least
resistance for the energy to escape. Once this occurs the more stable, but less
energetic, gradual feedback is able to keep the chimneys open. By funneling the
hot destructive gas away from the centre of the cloud, chimneys can have a
positive effect on both the efficiency and duration of star formation.
Moreover, the critical factor is the number of high mass stars and SNe (and any
subsequent HMXBs) active within the free-fall time of each cloud. This can vary
from cloud to cloud due to the stochasticity of SN delay times and in HMXB
formation. However, the defining factor in our simulations is the efficiency of
the cooling, which can alter the Jeans mass required for sink particle
formation, along with the number of massive stars in the cloud.

grains. Its presence in the solid-phase is inferred from its infrared (IR)
signals. In experimental observations of solid CO/water mixed samples, its IR
frequency splits into two components, giving rise to a blue- and a redshifted
band. However, in astronomical observations, the former has never been
observed. Several attempts have been carried out to explain this peculiar
behaviour, but the question still remains open. In this work, we resorted to
pure quantum mechanical simulations in order to shed some light on this
problem. We adopted different periodic models simulating the CO/H$_2$O ice
system, such as single and multiple CO adsorption on water ice surfaces, CO
entrapped into water cages and proper CO:H$_2$O mixed ices. We also simulated
pure solid CO. The detailed analysis of our data revealed how the quadrupolar
character of CO and the dispersive forces with water ice determine the
energetic of the CO/H$_2$O ice interaction, as well as the CO spectroscopic
behaviour. Our data suggest that the blueshifted peak can be assigned to CO
interacting {\it via} the C atom with dangling H atoms of the water ice, while
the redshifted one can actually be the result of CO involved in different
reciprocal interactions with the water matrix. We also provide a possible
explanation for the lack of the blueshifted peak in astronomical spectra. Our
aim is not to provide a full account of the various interstellar ices, but
rather to elucidate the sensitivity of the CO spectral features to different

qubits have demonstrated average single-qubit Clifford gate error rates that
approach this threshold, notably with error rates of 0.14% in isotopically
enriched $^{28}$Si/SiGe devices. This gate performance, together with
high-fidelity two-qubit gates and measurements, is only known to meet the

to reduce overhead. Here we experimentally show that pulse engineering

improvement on previous best results for silicon quantum dot devices. By
including tomographically complete measurements in randomised benchmarking, we
infer a higher-order feature of the noise called the unitarity, which measures
the coherence of noise. This in turn allows us to theoretically predict that

improvements. These fidelities are ultimately limited by Markovian noise, which

thermal origin and other out-of equilibrium mechanisms that would not require
so high temperatures like resonant photo-galvanic effects, or negative
mobilities. We argue that for a heating scenario the direction of the electron
flow under cyclotron resonance can be controlled by the shape of the initial
electron density profile, with a dependence that can be modeled accurately
within the Poisson-Boltzmann theory framework. This provides an self
consistency-check to probe if the redistribution is indeed consistent with a

the Poisson-Boltzmann theoretical dependence but some deviations suggest that
other physical mechanisms can also provide a measurable contribution. Analyzing
our results with the heating model we find that the electron temperatures
increases with electron density under the same microwave irradiation
conditions. This unexpected density dependence calls for a microscopic
treatment of the energy relaxation of overheated electrons.

(SPCN), also termed contralateral delay activity (CDA), while participants
performed a change detection task including to-be-memorized faces with
different intensities of anger. In one condition participants could freely use
their facial mimicry during the encoding/VWM maintenance of the faces, while in
a different condition, participants had their facial mimicry blocked by a gel.
Notably, SPCN amplitude was reduced for faces in the blocked mimicry condition
when compared to the free mimicry condition. This modulation interacted with
the empathy levels of participants such that only participants with medium-high
empathy scores showed such reduction of the SPCN amplitude when their mimicry
was blocked. The SPCN amplitude was larger for full expressions when compared
to neutral and subtle expressions, while subtle expressions elicited lower SPCN

While typical
random walks on networks consist of standard Markov chains whose static
transition probabilities dictate the flow of random walkers through the
network, nonlinear random walks consist of nonlinear Markov chains whose
transition probabilities change in time depending on the current state of the
system. This framework allows us to model more complex flows through networks
that may depend on the current system state. For instance, under humanitarian
or capitalistic direction, resource flow between institutions may be diverted
preferentially to poorer or wealthier institutions, respectively. Importantly,
the nonlinearity in this framework gives rise to richer dynamical behavior than
occurs in linear random walks. Here we study these dynamics that arise in
weakly and strongly nonlinear regimes in a family of nonlinear random walks
where random walkers are biased either towards (positive bias) or away from
(negative bias) nodes that currently have more random walkers. In the weakly
nonlinear regime we prove the existence and uniqueness of a stable stationary
state fixed point provided that the network structure is primitive that is
analogous to the stationary distribution of a typical (linear) random walk. We
also present an asymptotic analysis that allows us to approximate the
stationary state fixed point in the weakly nonlinear regime. We then turn our
attention to the strongly nonlinear regime. For negative bias we characterize a
period-doubling bifurcation where the stationary state fixed point loses
stability and gives rise to a periodic orbit below a critical value. For
positive bias we investigate the emergence of multistability of several stable
stationary state fixed points.

constantly charges and discharges by tunnelling electrons. These charging and

stochastic time intervals. These time intervals can be associated with dwelling
time for a charge (electron or hole) to reside on the molecule. In this paper,
the statistical properties of these time intervals are studied and general
formula for their distribution is derived. The theory is based on the Markovian
master equation which takes into account transitions between vibrational states
of charged and neutral molecule in the junction. Two quantum jump operators are
identified from the Liouvillian of the master equation - one corresponds to
charging of the molecule and the other discharges the molecule back to neutral
state. The quantum jump operators define the conditional probability that given
that the molecule was charged by a tunneling electron at time $t$, the molecule
becomes neutral at later time $t+\tau$ discharging the electron to the drain
electrode. Statistical properties of these time intervals $\tau$ are studied
with the use of this distribution.

twisted boundary conditions; in turn, twisted boundary conditions require us to
introduce a smell degree of freedom in order to include fermions in the
fundamental representation. As a first application, we compute the critical
mass of two flavours of Wilson fermions up to order $O(\beta^{-7})$ in a

staggered fermions in NSPT. The residual chiral symmetry of staggered fermions
protects the theory from an additive mass renormalisation. We compute the
perturbative expansion of the plaquette with two flavours of massless staggered
fermions up to order $O(\beta^{-35})$ in a ${\mathrm{SU}}(3)$ gauge theory, and
investigate the renormalon behaviour of such series. We are able to subtract
the power divergence in the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) for the plaquette

windowed pulses exhibit low spectral confinement. Two approaches usually
referred to as pulse-shaping and active interference cancellation (AIC) are
classically employed to reduce the out-of-band emission (OOBE) without
affecting the receiver. This paper proposes a spectral shaping method that
generalizes and unifies these two strategies. To this end, the OFDM carriers
are shaped with novel pulses, referred to as generalized pulses, that consist
of the ones used in conventional OFDM systems plus a series of cancellation
terms aimed at reducing the OOBE of the former. Hence, each generalized pulse
embeds all the terms required to reduce its spectrum in the desired bands. This
leads to a data-independent optimization problem that notably simplifies the
implementation complexity and allows the analytical calculation of the
resulting power spectral density (PSD), which in most methods found in the
literature can only be estimated by means of simulations. As an example of its
performance, the proposed technique allows complying with the stringent PSD
mask imposed by the EN 50561-1 with a data carrier loss lower than 4%. By
contrasts, 28% of the data carriers have to be nulled when pulse-shaping is

kink oscillation that had a period of about 428 seconds. In the meantime, a
large-scale EUV wave and a QFP wave are observed on the west of the interaction
position. It is interesting that the QFP wave showed refraction effect during
its passing through two strong magnetic regions. The angular extent, speed, and

the EUV was probably launched by the sudden expansion of the loop system due to
the impingement of the coronal jet; and the QFP wave was possibly formed
through the dispersive evolution of the disturbance caused by the jet-loop

that if it is possible to compute a ""large enough"" controlled invariant set
either for the actual system model or some simplification of the system model,
interesting corner cases for other control designs can be generated by sampling
initial conditions from the boundary of this controlled invariant set.
Moreover, if falsifying trajectories for a given control design can be found
through such sampling, then the controlled invariant set can be used as a
supervisor to ensure safe operation of the control design under consideration.
In addition to interesting initial conditions, which are mostly related to
safety violations in transients, we use solutions from a dual game, a
reachability game for the safety specification, to find falsifying inputs. We
also propose optimization-based heuristics for input generation for cases when
the state is outside the winning set of the dual game. To demonstrate the
proposed ideas, we consider case studies from basic autonomous driving
functionality, in particular, adaptive cruise control and lane keeping. We show
how the proposed technique can be used to find interesting falsifying

the energy index of the escape time scale, the quantity connecting the electron

achieved in two ways: (i) Any quantum trajectories can be monitored by directly
monitoring the environment, which is experimentally challenging for realistic
noises; (ii) Certain quantum trajectories can also be monitored by frequently
measuring the quantum probe alone via ancilla-assisted encoding and error
detection. This establishes an interesting connection between MQT and the full
quantum error correction protocol. Application of MQT to estimate the level
splitting and decoherence rate of a spin-1/2 under typical decoherence channels
demonstrate that it can avoid the long-time exponential loss of the estimation
precision and, in special cases, recover the Heisenberg scaling.

both the local level and whole block level. Experiments show that the optimal
vertical accuracy achieved by dense matching is as follows: the mean offset to

goes up to 1.0 GSD. When additional oblique images are used in dense matching,
the mean deviation, the variation of mean deviation and the level of random

Galileon scalar field concurrently dissipates its kinetic energy as the
radiation fluid throughout inflation and the universe smoothly enters into a
radiation dominated era without going through the reheating phase. It is shown
that the perturbed second-order Langevin equation can be nicely simplified and
solved by defining the Galileon dissipation factor, $Q_{G} =
\frac{Q}{\mathcal{B}}$, resulting in a power spectrum utilizing a Green
function approach for the dissipative coefficient independent of temperature.
However, for a dissipation coefficient depending on temperature, the perturbed
inflaton and radiation field equations will be coupled in the high temperature
regime. Therefore, the produced radiation backreacts on the power spectrum,
modifying it with a growing mode function in the high dissipation regime.
Finally, a model is proposed in which the standard Higgs boson dissipates into
light mediator fields, for instance, fermions with a linear temperature
dependent dissipative coefficient which can act as inflaton, thanks to the
Galileon-like non-linear derivative interaction. The generated primordial
perturbations in the G-dominant regime is in excellent agreement with Planck
2015 likelihood+ TTTEEE+BAO at large scales despite its large self-coupling
$\lambda \sim 0.13$ through accommodating many light mediator fields. However,
although such primordial perturbations may also get amplified by several orders
of magnitude at small scales due to the presence of the growing mode function,
warm G-inflation shows a striking feature in that the growing mode can be
controlled or completely disappeared by decreasing the value of the propagating
sound speed $c_{s}$.

noisy nature of the content and the weak signal of most of the words used. In
this paper, we propose using singular value decomposition (SVD) with clustering
to enhance the signals of the textual features in the tweets to improve the
correlation with events. The proposed technique applies SVD to the time series
vector for each feature to factorize the matrix of feature/day counts, in order
to ensure the independence of the feature vectors. Afterwards, the k-means
clustering is applied to build a look-up table that maps members of each
cluster to the cluster-centroid. The lookup table is used to map each feature
in the original data to the centroid of its cluster, then we calculate the sum
of the term frequency vectors of all features in each cluster to the
term-frequency-vector of the cluster centroid. To test the technique we
calculated the correlations of the cluster centroids with the golden standard
record (GSR) vector before and after summing the vectors of the cluster members
to the centroid-vector. The proposed method is applied to multiple correlation
techniques including the Pearson, Spearman, distance correlation and Kendal
Tao. The experiments have also considered the different word forms and lengths
of the features including keywords, n-grams, skip-grams and bags-of-words. The
correlation results are enhanced significantly as the highest correlation

feature linear span to increase the independence of convolutional features and
the efficiency of feature integration, which enlarges the capability of fitting

intermediate-mass stars in open clusters by using RV data obtained with HARPS
from an extensive survey with more than 15 years of observations for a sample
of 142 giant stars in 17 open clusters. We present the discovery of a periodic
RV signal compatible with the presence of a planet candidate in the 1.15 Gyr
open cluster IC4651 orbiting the 2.06 M$_\odot$ star No. 9122. If confirmed,
the planet candidate would have a minimum mass of 7.2 M$_{J}$ and a period of
747 days. However, we also find that the FWHM of the CCF varies with a period
close to the RV, casting doubts on the planetary nature of the signal. We also
provide refined parameters for the previously discovered planet around NGC2423
No. 3 but show evidence that the BIS of the CCF is correlated with the RV
during some of the observing periods. This fact advises us that this might not
be a real planet and that the RV variations could be caused by stellar activity
and/or pulsations. Finally, we show that the previously reported signal by a
brown dwarf around NGC4349 No. 127 is presumably produced by stellar activity
modulation. The long-term monitoring of several red giants in open clusters has
allowed us to find periodic RV variations in several stars. However, we also
show that the follow-up of this kind of stars should last more than one orbital
period to detect long-term signals of stellar origin. This work warns that
although it is possible to detect planets around red giants, large-amplitude,
long-period RV modulations do exist in such stars that can mimic the presence
of an orbiting planetary body. Therefore, we need to better understand how such
RV modulations behave as stars evolve along the RGB and perform a detailed
study of all the possible stellar-induced signals (e.g. spots, pulsations,
granulation) to comprehend the origin of RV variations.

  using hyperintensities in FLAIR images",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease that affects more than 2
million people worldwide. The most used imaging technique to help in its
diagnosis and follow-up is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fluid Attenuated
Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images are usually acquired in the context of MS
because lesions often appear hyperintense in this particular image weight,
making it easier for physicians to identify them. Though lesions have a bright
intensity profile, it may overlap with white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM)
tissues, posing difficulties to be accurately segmented. In this sense, we
propose a lesion enhancement technique to dim down WM and GM regions and
highlight hyperintensities, making them much more distinguishable than other
tissues. We applied our technique to the ISBI 2015 MS Lesion Segmentation
Challenge and took the average gray level intensity of MS lesions, WM and GM on
FLAIR and enhanced images. The lesion intensity profile in FLAIR was on average
25% and 19% brighter than white matter and gray matter, respectively;
comparatively, the same profile in our enhanced images was on average 444% and
264% brighter. Such results mean a significant improvement on the intensity
distinction among these three clusters, which may come as aid both for experts
and automated techniques. Moreover, a byproduct of our proposal is that the
enhancement can be used to automatically estimate a mask encompassing WM and MS
lesions, which may be useful for brain tissue volume assessment and improve MS
lesion segmentation accuracy in future works.

radio data. The broad-band radio/X-ray spectra can be well described with a
synchrotron emission model from a single population of CR electrons with a
power law energy distribution and an exponential cutoff. The power law index of
the electron particle distribution function (PDF) is ~1.88-1.95 for both the NE
and SW limbs, and we do not find significant evidence for a variation of this
index at different energy (curvature). There are significant spatial variations
of the synchrotron emission parameters. The highest energy electrons are
accelerated in regions with the lowest expansion velocity, which is opposite to
what has been found in the Tycho's SNR. In addition to a gradual steepening of
synchrotron emission from the center of the non-thermal limbs to larger
azimuthal angles, we also find that both the emission spectrum and the PDF are
significantly flatter in three regions in the SW limb where the shock
encounters higher density ambient medium. The NE limb also shows significantly
higher cutoff energy in the PDF than the SW limb. By comparing with the roughly
symmetric TeV emission and largely asymmetric GeV emission from the two

arrest transitions in highly asymmetric binary colloidal mixtures, namely, a
single glass of big particles, in which the small species remains ergodic, and
a double glass with the simultaneous arrest of both components. When the
mixture approaches any glass transition, the relaxation of the collective
dynamics of both species becomes coupled. In the single glass domain, spatial
modulations occur due to the structure of the large spheres, a feature not
observed in the two-glass domain. The relaxation of the \emph{self} dynamics of
small and large particles, in contrast, become decoupled at the boundaries of
both transitions; the large species always displays dynamical arrest, whereas
the small ones appear arrested only in the double glass. Thus, in order to

(colour-singlet bound states of two quarks and two antiquarks) in the
(idealized) limit of a large number $N_c$ of colour degrees of freedom of
quantum chromodynamics. Considering the scattering of two ordinary mesons into
two ordinary mesons, we start off with formulating a set of selection criteria
that should enable us to unambiguously single out precisely those contributions
to all encountered scattering amplitudes that potentially will develop
tetraquark poles. Assuming that tetraquark mesons do exist and, if so, emerge
in the contributions compatible with our criteria at largest admissible order
of $N_c$, we deduce, for the categories of tetraquarks that exhibit either four
or only two different open quark flavours, that the decay rates of these
tetraquark types are, at least, of order $1/N_c^2$ and that internal
consistency requires all the members of the first species to exist pairwise,
distinguishable by their favoured two-ordinary-meson decay channels.

straightforward since they may need multiple processing tasks and iterations.
Furthermore, parameter and performance studies are common approaches used to
characterize a simulation, often requiring traversal of a large parameter
space. High-performance computers offer practical resources at the expense of
users handling the setup, submission, and management of jobs. This work
presents the design of PaPaS, a portable, lightweight, and generic workflow
framework for conducting parallel parameter and performance studies. Workflows
are defined using parameter files based on keyword-value pairs syntax, thus
removing from the user the overhead of creating complex scripts to manage the
workflow. A parameter set consists of any combination of environment variables,
files, partial file contents, and command line arguments. PaPaS is being
developed in Python 3 with support for distributed parallelization using SSH,
batch systems, and C++ MPI. The PaPaS framework will run as user processes, and
can be used in single/multi-node and multi-tenant computing systems. An example
simulation using the BehaviorSpace tool from NetLogo and a matrix multiply
using OpenMP are presented as parameter and performance studies, respectively.
The results demonstrate that the PaPaS framework offers a simple method for
defining and managing parameter studies, while increasing resource utilization.

Most of the field measurements available in the literature have a relatively
low sensitivity, while current instruments allow us to detect magnetic fields
of white dwarfs with sub-kG precision. With the aim of obtaining a more
complete view of the incidence of magnetic fields in degenerate stars, we have
started a long-term campaign of high-precision spectropolarimetric observations
of white dwarfs. Here we report the results obtained so far with the
low-resolution FORS2 instrument of the ESO VLT and the medium-resolution ISIS
instrument of the WHT. We have considered a sample of 48 stars, of which five
are known magnetic or suspected magnetic stars, and obtained new longitudinal
magnetic field measurements with a mean uncertainty of about 0.6 kG. Overall,
in the course of our survey (the results of which have been partially published
in papers devoted to individual stars) we have discovered one new weak-field
magnetic white dwarf, confirmed the magnetic nature of another, found that a
suspected magnetic star is not magnetic, and suggested two new candidate
magnetic white dwarfs. Even combined with data previously obtained in the
literature, our sample is not sufficient yet to reach any final conclusions
about the actual incidence of very weak magnetic fields in white dwarfs, but we
have set the basis to achieve a homogeneous survey of an unbiased sample of
white dwarfs. As a by-product, our survey has also enabled us to carry out a
detailed characterisation of the ISIS and the FORS2 instruments for the
detection of extremely weak magnetic fields in white dwarfs, and in particular
to relate the S/N to measurement uncertainty for white dwarfs of different
spectral types. This study will help the optimisation of future observations.

have drastically different test losses and errors? Better understanding of this
question of generalization may improve practical applications of deep networks.
In this paper we show that with cross-entropy loss it is surprisingly simple to
induce significantly different generalization performances for two networks
that have the same architecture, the same meta parameters and the same training
error: one can either pretrain the networks with different levels of
""corrupted"" data or simply initialize the networks with weights of different
Gaussian standard deviations. A corollary of recent theoretical results on
overfitting shows that these effects are due to an intrinsic problem of
measuring test performance with a cross-entropy/exponential-type loss, which
can be decomposed into two components both minimized by SGD -- one of which is
not related to expected classification performance. However, if we factor out
this component of the loss, a linear relationship emerges between training and
test losses. Under this transformation, classical generalization bounds are
surprisingly tight: the empirical/training loss is very close to the
expected/test loss. Furthermore, the empirical relation between classification
error and normalized cross-entropy loss seem to be approximately monotonic

but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially at high diffusion
weighting (i.e., b-value). To avoid time-intensive repeated acquisition,
post-processing algorithms are often used to reduce noise. Among existing
methods, non-local means (NLM) has been shown to be particularly effective.
However, most NLM algorithms for diffusion MRI focus on patch matching in the
spatial domain (i.e., x-space) and disregard the fact that the data live in a
combined 6D space covering both spatial domain and diffusion wavevector domain
(i.e., q-space). This drawback leads to inaccurate patch matching in curved
white matter structures and hence the inability to effectively use recurrent
information for noise reduction. The goal of this paper is to overcome this
limitation by extending NLM to the joint x-q space. Specifically, we define for
each point in the x-q space a spherical patch from which we extract
rotation-invariant features for patch matching. The ability to perform patch
matching across q-samples allows patches from differentially orientated
structures to be used for effective noise removal. Extensive experiments on
synthetic, repeated acquisition, and real data demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

early output dual-bit full adder (DBFA). An asynchronous ripple carry adder
(RCA) is constructed based on the new asynchronous DBFAs and existing
asynchronous early output single-bit full adders (SBFAs). The asynchronous
DBFAs and SBFAs incorporate redundant logic and are encoded using the
delay-insensitive dual-rail code (i.e. homogeneous data encoding) and follow a
4-phase return-to-zero handshaking. Compared to the previous asynchronous RCAs
involving DBFAs and SBFAs, which are based on homogeneous or heterogeneous
delay-insensitive data encodings and which correspond to different timing
models, the early output asynchronous RCA incorporating the proposed DBFAs
and/or SBFAs is found to result in reduced area for the dual-operand addition
operation and feature significantly less latency than the asynchronous RCAs
which consist of only SBFAs. The proposed asynchronous DBFA requires 28.6% less
silicon than the previously reported asynchronous DBFA. For a 32-bit
asynchronous RCA, utilizing 2 stages of SBFAs in the least significant
positions and 15 stages of DBFAs in the more significant positions leads to
optimization in the latency. The new early output 32-bit asynchronous RCA
containing DBFAs and SBFAs reports the following optimizations in design
metrics over its counterparts: i) 18.8% reduction in area than a previously
reported 32-bit early output asynchronous RCA which also has 15 stages of DBFAs

Cauchy horizons. Many years ago we proved that, if the null geodesic generators
of such a horizon were all \textit{closed} curves, then the enveloping
spacetime would necessarily admit a non-trivial, horizon-generating Killing
vector field. Using a slightly extended version of the Cauchy-Kowaleski theorem
one could establish the existence of infinite dimensional, analytic families of
such `generalized Taub-NUT' spacetimes and show that, generically, they
admitted \textit{only} the single (horizon-generating) Killing field alluded to
above. In this article we relax the closure assumption and analyze vacuum
spacetimes in which the generic horizon generating null geodesic densely fills
a 2-torus lying in the horizon. In particular we show that, aside from some
highly exceptional cases that we refer to as `ergodic', the non-closed
generators always have this (densely 2-torus-filling) geometrical property in
the analytic setting.
  By extending arguments we gave previously for the characterization of the
Killing symmetries of higher dimensional, stationary black holes we prove that
analytic, 4-dimensional, vacuum spacetimes with such (non-ergodic) compact
Cauchy horizons always admit (at least) two independent, commuting Killing
vector fields of which a special linear combination is horizon generating. We
also discuss the \textit{conjectures} that every such spacetime with an
\textit{ergodic} horizon is trivially constructable from the flat Kasner
solution by making certain `irrational' toroidal compactifications and that
degenerate compact Cauchy horizons do not exist in the analytic case.

establish the age of the oldest stellar populations and to measure the
color-magnitude relation of stars. Infrared (IR) photometry of these objects
provides a new opportunity to accomplish this task. In particular, at low
stellar masses, the stellar main sequence (MS) in an IR color-magnitude diagram
(CMD) exhibits a sharp ""kink"" (due to opacity effects in M dwarfs), such that
lower mass and cooler dwarfs become bluer in the F110W - F160W color baseline
and not redder. This inversion of the color-magnitude relation offers the
possibility to fit GC properties using IR imaging, and to reduce their
uncertainties. Here, we used the IR channel of the Wide Field Camera 3 onboard
the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain new, deep high-resolution photometry of
the old metal-poor GC NGC6397. From the analysis of the GC CMD, we revealed
below the MS ""kink"" the presence of two MSs with different chemical
composition. We derived the cluster fiducial line and we compared it with a
grid of isochrones over a large range of parameter space, allowing age,
metallicity, distance and reddening to vary freely within reasonable selected
ranges. We derived an age of 12.6 Gyr with a random uncertainty sigma ~ 0.7
Gyr. These results confirm that the analysis of the IR color-magnitude of stars
provide a valuable tool to measure the GC ages and offers a new venue to
determine their absolute age to sub-Gyr accuracy with next generation IR
telescopes.

is that they are programmable, so that different spin models can be simulated
in the same chip, as well as various initial states can be encoded into it in a
controllable way. This opens an opportunity to use superconducting quantum
computers in studies of fundamental problems of statistical physics such as the
absence or presence of thermalization in the free evolution of a closed quantum
system depending on the choice of the initial state as well as on the
integrability of the model. In the present paper, we performed
proof-of-principle digital simulations of two spin models, which are the
central spin model and the transverse-field Ising model, using 5- and 16-qubit
superconducting quantum computers of the IBM Quantum Experience. We found that
these devices are able to reproduce some important consequences of the symmetry
of the initial state for the system's subsequent dynamics, such as the
excitation blockade. However, lengths of algorithms are currently limited due
to quantum gate errors. We also discuss some heuristic methods which can be

be represented by multiple features which locate in high-dimensional space.
Multiple features can re ect various perspectives of one same sample, so there
must be compatible and complementary information among the multiple views.
Therefore, it's natural to integrate multiple features together to obtain
better performance. However, most multi-view dimension reduction methods cannot
handle multiple features from nonlinear space with high dimensions. To address
this problem, we propose a novel multi-view dimension reduction method named
Multi-view Reconstructive Preserving Embedding (MRPE) in this paper. MRPE
reconstructs each sample by utilizing its k nearest neighbors. The similarities
between each sample and its neighbors are primely mapped into lower-dimensional
space in order to preserve the underlying neighborhood structure of the
original manifold. MRPE fully exploits correlations between each sample and its
neighbors from multiple views by linear reconstruction. Furthermore, MRPE
constructs an optimization problem and derives an iterative procedure to obtain
the low-dimensional embedding. Various evaluations based on the applications of
document classification, face recognition and image retrieval demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach on multi-view dimension reduction.

are obtained for designing a stabilizing controller with a predetermined order,
which can be chosen to be as low as possible. The LMI-based procedures of
designing robust stabilizing controllers are preserved in spite of the
complexity of assuming the most complete model of linear controller, with

  Loss",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In typical machine learning tasks and applications, it is necessary to obtain
or create large labeled datasets in order to to achieve high performance.
Unfortunately, large labeled datasets are not always available and can be
expensive to source, creating a bottleneck towards more widely applicable
machine learning. The paradigm of weak supervision offers an alternative that
allows for integration of domain-specific knowledge by enforcing constraints
that a correct solution to the learning problem will obey over the output
space. In this work, we explore the application of this paradigm to 2-D
physical systems governed by non-linear differential equations. We demonstrate
that knowledge of the partial differential equations governing a system can be
encoded into the loss function of a neural network via an appropriately chosen
convolutional kernel. We demonstrate this by showing that the steady-state
solution to the 2-D heat equation can be learned directly from initial
conditions by a convolutional neural network, in the absence of labeled
training data. We also extend recent work in the progressive growing of fully
convolutional networks to achieve high accuracy (< 1.5% error) at multiple
scales of the heat-flow problem, including at the very large scale (1024x1024).
Finally, we demonstrate that this method can be used to speed up exact
calculation of the solution to the differential equations via finite
difference.

tubes may undergo a limit-point, or inflation, instability manifested by a
rapid transition in which their radii suddenly increase. The possible existence
of such an instability depends on the material constitutive model. Here, we
revisit this problem in the context of stochastic incompressible hyperelastic
materials, and ask the question: what is the probability distribution of stable
radially symmetric inflation, such that the internal pressure always increases
as the radial stretch increases? For the classic elastic problem, involving
isotropic incompressible materials, there is a critical parameter value that
strictly separates the cases where inflation instability can occur or not. By
contrast, for the stochastic problem, we show that the inherent variability of
the probabilistic parameters implies that there is always competition between
the two cases. To illustrate this, we draw on published experimental data for
rubber, and derive the probability distribution of the corresponding random
shear modulus to predict the inflation responses for a spherical shell and a
cylindrical tube made of a material characterised by this parameter.

more susceptible to damage and more than 60% of the bridges in California are

skewness, this paper evaluates the seismic vulnerability of skewed concrete
box-girder bridges in California subjected to near-fault and far-field ground
motions. The relative risk of skewness and fault-location on the bridges is
evaluated by developing fragility curves of bridge components and system
accounting for the material, geometric, and structural uncertainties. It is
noted that the skewness and bridge site close to active faults make bridges
more vulnerable, and the existing modification factor in HAZUS cannot capture
the variation in the median value of the fragilities appropriately. A new set
of fragility adjustment factors for skewness coupled with the effect of fault
