\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ denote the Heisenberg group with the usual
Carnot-Carath\'eodory metric $d$. It is known (since the work of Pansu and
Semmes) that the metric space $(H,d)$ cannot be embedded in a bilipchitz
fashion into a Hilbert space; however, from a general theorem of Assouad, for
any $0 < \varepsilon < 1$, the snowflaked metric space $(H,d^{1-\varepsilon})$
embeds into an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space with distortion $O(
\varepsilon^{-1/2} )$. This distortion bound was shown by Austin, Naor, and
Tessera to be sharp for the Heisenberg group $H$. Assouad's argument allows
$\ell^2$ to be replaced by ${\mathbf R}^{D(\varepsilon)}$ for some dimension
$D(\varepsilon)$ dependent on $\varepsilon$. Naor and Neiman showed that $D$
could be taken independent of $\varepsilon$, at the cost of worsening the bound
on the distortion to $O( \varepsilon^{-1+c_D} )$, where $c_D \to 0$ as $D \to
\infty$. In this paper we show that one can in fact retain the optimal
distortion bound $O( \varepsilon^{-1/2} )$ and still embed into a bounded
dimensional space ${\mathbf R}^D$, answering a question of Naor and Neiman. As
a corollary, the discrete ball of radius $R \geq 2$ in $\Gamma :=
\begin{pmatrix} 1 & {\mathbf Z} & {\mathbf Z} \\ 0 & 1 & {\mathbf Z} \\ 0 & 0 &
1 \end{pmatrix}$ can be embedded into a bounded-dimensional space ${\mathbf
R}^D$ with the optimal distortion bound of $O(\log^{1/2} R)$. The construction
is iterative, and is inspired by the Nash-Moser iteration scheme as used in the
isometric embedding problem; this scheme is needed in order to counteract a
certain ``loss of derivatives'' problem in the iteration.

effect (MOKE). The analysis of many independently grown films shows that the
paramagnetic tail of the susceptibility is described by $\chi(T) \sim \exp
\bigr{(}B/(T/T_{KT}-1)^a\bigl{)}$, where $a=0.50\pm0.03$ and $B=3.48\pm0.16$,
in quantitative agreement with KT theory. Below the finite-size transition
temperature $T_C(L)$, the behavior is complicated by dissipation (likely
related to the re-emergence of fourfold anisotropy and magnetic domains). A
subset of measurements with very small dissipation most closely represents the
idealized system treated by theory. In these, the temperature interval between
the fitted Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature and the finite-size
transition temperature is $T_C(L)/T_{KT} -1=0.065\pm0.016$. This yeids an
estimate of the finite size $L$ affecting the film of order micrometers. This
gives experimental support to the idea that even a mesoscopic limitation of the
vortex-antivortex gas results in a substantial finite-size effect at the KT
transition. In contrast, fitting the paramagnetic tail to a power law,
appropriate to a second order critical transition, does not give reasonable
results. The effective critical exponent $\gamma_{eff} \approx 3.7 \pm 0.7$
does not correspond to a known universality class, and the fitted transition
temperature is much further below the peak in the susceptibility than is

(IoT) devices are proliferated in many domains including critical
infrastructures such as energy, transportation and manufacturing. Consequently,
most of the daily operations now rely on the data coming from wireless sensors
or IoT devices and their actions. In addition, personal IoT devices are heavily
used for social media applications, which connect people as well as all
critical infrastructures to each other under the cyber domain. However, this
connectedness also comes with the risk of increasing number of cyber attacks
through WSNs and/or IoT. While a significant research has been dedicated to
secure WSN/IoT, this still indicates that there needs to be forensics
mechanisms to be able to conduct investigations and analysis. In particular,
understanding what has happened after a failure is crucial to many businesses,
which rely on WSN/IoT applications. Therefore, there is a great interest and
need for understanding digital forensics applications in WSN and IoT realms.
This chapter fills this gap by providing an overview and classification of
digital forensics research and applications in these emerging domains in a
comprehensive manner. In addition to analyzing the technical challenges, the
chapter provides a survey of the existing efforts from the device level to
network level while also pointing out future research opportunities.

  study of Progress 8 and school accountability in England",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the UK, US and elsewhere, school accountability systems increasingly
compare schools using value-added measures of school performance derived from
pupil scores in high-stakes standardised tests. Rather than naively comparing
school average scores, which largely reflect school intake differences in prior
attainment, these measures attempt to compare the average progress or
improvement pupils make during a year or phase of schooling. Schools, however,
also differ in terms of their pupil demographic and socioeconomic
characteristics and these also predict why some schools subsequently score
higher than others. Many therefore argue that value-added measures unadjusted
for pupil background are biased in favour of schools with more 'educationally
advantaged' intakes. But, others worry that adjusting for pupil background
entrenches socioeconomic inequities and excuses low performing schools. In this
article we explore these theoretical arguments and their practical importance
in the context of the 'Progress 8' secondary school accountability system in
England which has chosen to ignore pupil background. We reveal how the reported
low or high performance of many schools changes dramatically once adjustments
are made for pupil background and these changes also affect the reported
differential performances of region and of different school types. We conclude
that accountability systems which choose to ignore pupil background are likely
to reward and punish the wrong schools and this will likely have detrimental
effects on pupil learning. These findings, especially when coupled with more
general concerns surrounding high-stakes testing and school value-added models,
raise serious doubts about their use in school accountability systems.

senses or meanings of a word, has three main challenges: domain adaptability,
novel sense detection, and sense granularity flexibility. While current latent
variable models are known to solve the first two challenges, they are not
flexible to different word sense granularities, which differ very much among
words, from aardvark with one sense, to play with over 50 senses. Current
models either require hyperparameter tuning or nonparametric induction of the
number of senses, which we find both to be ineffective. Thus, we aim to
eliminate these requirements and solve the sense granularity problem by
proposing AutoSense, a latent variable model based on two observations: (1)
senses are represented as a distribution over topics, and (2) senses generate
pairings between the target word and its neighboring word. These observations
alleviate the problem by (a) throwing garbage senses and (b) additionally
inducing fine-grained word senses. Results show great improvements over the
state-of-the-art models on popular WSI datasets. We also show that AutoSense is
able to learn the appropriate sense granularity of a word. Finally, we apply
AutoSense to the unsupervised author name disambiguation task where the sense
granularity problem is more evident and show that AutoSense is evidently better
than competing models. We share our data and code here:

achieve higher registration accuracy as judged by Dice score on region labels

negative Jacobian determinants, FAIM produces deformations with many fewer
""foldings"", i.e. regions of non-invertibility where the surface folds over
itself. In our experiment, we varied the strength of this penalty and
investigated changes in registration accuracy and non-invertibility in terms of
number of ""folding"" locations. We found that FAIM is able to maintain both the
advantages of higher accuracy and fewer ""folding"" locations over VoxelMorph,
over a range of hyper-parameters (with the same values used for both networks).
Further, when trading off registration accuracy for better invertibility, FAIM
required less sacrifice of registration accuracy. Codes for this paper will be

an efficient method to automatically detect the L3 slice in 3D CT images. Our
method works with images with a variety of fields of view, occlusions, and
slice thicknesses. 3D CT images are first converted into 2D via Maximal
Intensity Projection (MIP), reducing the dimensionality of the problem. The MIP
images are then used as input to a 2D fully-convolutional network to predict
the L3 slice locations in the form of 2D confidence maps. In addition we
propose a variant architecture with less parameters allowing 1D confidence map
prediction and slightly faster prediction time without loss of accuracy.
Quantitative evaluation of our method on a dataset of 1006 3D CT images yields
a median error of 1mm, similar to the inter-rater median error of 1mm obtained
from two annotators, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
efficiently and accurately detecting the L3 slice.

hair being that of the underlying black hole space-time, we start by writing
down the most general action for the background and the fluctuation in the
effective field theory framework. Considering the asymptotically flat and de
Sitter black hole background with a spherically symmetric hair we derived the
most general equation of motion for the fluctuation. For a particular choice of
theory parameters, quasinormal modes corresponding to those fluctuations
appeared to have distinct features compared to that of the usual black hole
quasinormal modes. The background equations from the effective theory
Lagrangian, on the other hand, seemed to suggest that the underlying theory of
the hair under consideration should be higher derivative in nature. Therefore
as a concrete example we construct a class of higher derivative scalar field
theory which gives rise to spherically symmetric hair through background
cosmological constant. We also calculate the quasinormal modes whose behaviour
turned out to be similar to the one discussed from the effective theory.

medium-resolution spectroscopy of six T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga star
forming region. We have characterized the H$\alpha$ photometric system using
synthetic templates and the contemporaneous spectra of the targets. We show
that we can achieve a precision corresponding to 2$-$3 \AA\ in the H$\alpha$
equivalent width, in typical observing conditions. The spectral analysis has
allowed us to determine the basic stellar parameters and the values of
quantities related to the accretion. In particular, we have measured a
significant veiling only for the three targets with the strongest H$\alpha$
emission (T Tau, FM Tau, and DG Tau). The broad-band photometric variations are
found to be in the range 0.05$-$0.70 mag and are often paired to variations in
the H$\alpha$ intensity, which becomes stronger when the stellar continuum is
weaker. In addition, we have mostly observed a redder $V-I$ and a bluer $B-V$
color as the stars become fainter. For most of the targets, the timescales of
these variations seem to be longer than the rotation period. One exception is T
Tau, for which the broad-band photometry varies with the rotation period. The
most plausible interpretation of these photometric and H$\alpha$ variations is
that they are due to non-stationary mass accretion onto the stars, but
rotational modulation can play a major role in some cases.

be convex and polygonally or polyhedrally bounded such that an application of
point-wise error estimates results in a rate less than two in general. The main
ingredient for proving the quasi-optimal estimates is the structural and
commonly used assumption that the obstacle is inactive on the boundary of the
domain. Then localization techniques are used to estimate the global
$L^2$-error by a local error in the inner part of the domain, where higher
regularity for the solution can be assumed, and a global error for the
Ritz-projection of the solution, which can be estimated by standard techniques.
We validate our results by numerical examples.

symmetry Delta(384) and CP. The peculiar features of lepton and quark mixing
are accomplished by the stepwise breaking of the flavor and CP symmetry. The
correct description of lepton mixing angles requires two steps of symmetry
breaking, where tri-bimaximal mixing arises after the first step. In the quark
sector the Cabibbo angle theta_C equals sin pi/16 = 0.195 after the first step
of symmetry breaking and it is brought into full agreement with experimental
data after the second step. The two remaining quark mixing angles are generated
after the third step of symmetry breaking. All three leptonic CP phases are
predicted, sin delta^l = -0.936, |sin alpha|=|sin beta|=1/sqrt{2}. The amount
of CP violation in the quark sector turns out to be maximal at the lowest order
and is correctly accounted for, when higher order effects are included. Charged
fermion masses are reproduced with the help of operators with different numbers
of flavor (and CP) symmetry breaking fields. Light neutrino masses, arising
from the type-I seesaw mechanism, can accommodate both mass orderings, normal
and inverted. The vacuum alignment of the flavor (and CP) symmetry breaking

mode-dependent single-photon subtraction from multimode squeezed states. This
encoding can be seen as a generalization to the case of non-zero squeezing of
the standard single-photon multi-rail encoding. The advantage is that the
presence of squeezing enables the use of common tools in continuous-variable
quantum processing, which in turn allows to show that arbitrary $d$-level
quantum states can be generated and detected via simply tuning the classical
fields that gates the photon-subtraction scheme. Therefore, the scheme is
suitable for mapping arbitrary classical data in quantum mechanical form.
Regardless the dimension of the data set alphabet, the mapping is conditioned
on the subtraction of a single photon only, making it nearly unconditional. We
prove that this encoding can be used to calculate vector distances, a pivotal
primitive in various quantum machine learning algorithms.

absorption spectroscopy. All three polycations could be adsorbed at the
aggregates without flocculation or precipitation when added in molar amounts of
monomers sufficiently smaller than of the dye molecules. Preferably the
aggregates are either coated by the polycations in total or left completely
uncoated. For the coated aggregates, the adsorption leads to charge reversal of
the aggregate surface as supported by zeta-potential measurements. The
morphology of the coating differs significantly for the three polycations: The
branched polycation polyethlyenimine (PEI) attaches to the tubular aggregate by
hit-and-stick adsorption of the coiled state in solution forming irregular
clot-like coatings; the flexible and weakly cationic poly(allylamine
hydrochloride) (PAH) forms a more homogeneous coating but destroys the
integrity of the dye aggregate; the more hydrophobic and strong polycation
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) forms a thin and homogeneous
layer, supposedly by wrapping around the tubular aggregate. For the latter,
growth of a second dye double layer of the aggregates seems to grow. The
different morphologies of the coatings are rather due to the details of the
chemical structure of the polycations than due to physical parameters. The
possible adsorption of polyelectrolytes at these amphiphilic tubular
structures, stabilized by non-covalent bonds only, is far from obvious but
demonstrates an applicable route to the build-up of more complex nanostructures

environments for the low-magnetic-field case. Through a step-by-step
exploration of orbital and stellar wind effects on the planetary outflow, we

wind$\textrm{---}$which cannot confine the planetary outflow, leading to a

dayside arm and a slightly redward-skewed spectrum during transit. The
intermediate regime truncates the dayside outflow at large distances from the
planet and causes periodic disruptions of the outflow, producing observational
signatures that mimic a double transit. The first of these dips is blue-shifted
and precedes the optical transit. Finally, strong stellar winds completely
confine the outflow into a cometary tail and accelerate the outflow outwards,
producing large blue-shifted signals post-transit. Across all three regimes,
large signals occur far outside of transit, offering motivation to continue
ultraviolet observations outside of direct transit.

acceleration soon after ejection. We discuss the possibilities that bullet
acceleration is caused by either a non-radial magnetic field and/or by
hydrodynamic interaction with the ambient gas through which the bullet is
traveling.

combined cluster sample, we estimate systematic uncertainties of $\sim$0.11 dex
and $\sim$0.09 dex in [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe], respectively. We apply our
method to deep, low-resolution spectra of 11 red giant branch stars in the
smooth halo of M31, resulting in higher signal-to-noise per spectral resolution
element compared to DEIMOS medium-resolution spectroscopy, given the same
exposure time and conditions. We find $\langle$[$\alpha$/Fe]$\rangle$ = 0.49
$\pm$ 0.29 dex and $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ = 1.59 $\pm$ 0.56 dex for our
sample. This implies that---much like the Milky Way---the smooth halo of M31 is
likely composed of disrupted dwarf galaxies with truncated star formation
histories that were accreted early in the halo's formation.

former. Previous works have proposed that the blend of the OVI Ka line (22.032

observed in the X-ray spectra. Here we present a detailed study of the oxygen
absorption in the local ISM, implementing our new model IGMabs, which includes
photoabsorption cross-sections of highly ionized species of abundant elements
as well as turbulence broadening. By analyzing high-resolution Chandra spectra
of 13 low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and 29 extragalactic sources, we have
estimated the column densities of OI-OIII and from OVI-OVIII along multiple

30% of the total OVI Ka + OII Kb. We conclude that the amount of OII predicted

driving galaxy evolution can be directly studied with high resolution integral

important to examine in galaxy mergers, where violent interactions of gas takes
place in the interstellar medium during the course of the galactic collision.
As part of our effort to systematically study the local population of luminous
infrared galaxies within the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey, we
undertook the Keck OSIRIS AO LIRG Analysis observing campaign to study the gas
dynamics in the inner kiloparsec regions of these systems at spatial scales of
a few 10s of parsecs. With high-resolution near-infrared adaptive
optics-assisted integral-field observations taken with OSIRIS on the Keck
Telescopes, we employ near-infrared diagnostics such as Brg and the
ro-vibrationally excited H2 lines to quantify the nuclear star formation rate
and identify feedback associated with shocked molecular gas seen in 21 nearby
luminous infrared galaxies. Shocked molecular gas is preferentially found in
the ultraluminous infrared systems, but may also be triggered at a lower
luminosity, earlier merging stage. On circumnuclear scales, AGN have a strong
effect on heating the surrounding molecular gas, though their coupling is not
simply driven by AGN strength but rather is complicated by orientation, dust
shielding, density, and other factors. We find that the nuclear star formation
correlates with merger class and diminishing projected nuclear separations.
These trends are largely consistent with the picture of merger-induced
starbursts within the center of galaxy mergers.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stz3286",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Star-forming galaxies can in principle be transformed into passive systems by
a multitude of processes that quench star formation, such as the halting of gas
accretion (starvation) or the rapid removal of gas in AGN-driven outflows.
However, it remains unclear which processes are the most significant, primary
drivers of the SF-passive bimodality. We address this key issue in galaxy
evolution by studying the chemical properties of 80,000 local galaxies in SDSS
DR7. In order to distinguish between different quenching mechanisms, we analyse
the stellar metallicities of star-forming, green valley and passive galaxies.
We find that the significant difference in stellar metallicity between passive
galaxies and their star-forming progenitors implies that for galaxies at all
masses, quenching must have involved an extended phase of starvation. However,
some form of gas ejection also has to be introduced into our models to best
match the observed properties of local passive galaxies, indicating that, while
starvation is likely to be the prerequisite for quenching, it is the
combination of starvation and outflows that is responsible for quenching the
majority of galaxies. Closed-box models indicate that the duration of the
quenching phase is 2-3 Gyr, with an $e$-folding time of 2-4 Gyr, after which
further star formation is prevented by an ejective/heating mode. Alternatively,
leaky-box models find a longer duration for the quenching phase of 5-7 Gyr and
an $e$-folding time of $\sim$1 Gyr, with outflows becoming increasingly
important with decreasing stellar mass. Finally, our analysis of local green
valley galaxies indicates that quenching is slower in the local Universe than
at high-redshift.

relaxation problems. The RD is a class of schemes which is used to solve
hyperbolic system of partial differential equations. Up to our knowledge, it
was used only for systems with mild source terms, such as gravitation problems
or shallow water equations. What we propose is an IMEX (implicit--explicit)
version of the residual distribution schemes, that can resolve stiff source
terms, without refining the discretization up to the stiffness scale. This can
be particularly useful in various models, where the stiffness is given by
topological or physical quantities, e.g. multiphase flows, kinetic models,
viscoelasticity problems. Moreover, the provided scheme is able to catch
different relaxation scales automatically, without losing accuracy. The scheme
is asymptotic preserving and this guarantees that in the relaxation limit, we
recast the expected macroscopic behaviour. To get a high order accuracy, we use
an IMEX time discretization combined with a Deferred Correction (DeC)
procedure, while naturally RD provides high order space discretization.
Finally, we show some numerical tests in 1D and 2D for stiff systems of

limited by uncertainty in the selection effects and photometric calibration of
$z<0.1$ Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The Foundation Supernova Survey is
designed to lower these uncertainties by creating a new sample of $z<0.1$ SNe
Ia observed on the Pan-STARRS system. Here, we combine the Foundation sample
with SNe from the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey and measure cosmological
parameters with 1,338 SNe from a single telescope and a single, well-calibrated
photometric system. For the first time, both the low-$z$ and high-$z$ data are
predominantly discovered by surveys that do not target pre-selected galaxies,
reducing selection bias uncertainties. The $z>0.1$ data include 875 SNe without
spectroscopic classifications and we show that we can robustly marginalize over
CC SN contamination. We measure Foundation Hubble residuals to be fainter than
the pre-existing low-$z$ Hubble residuals by $0.046 \pm 0.027$ mag (stat+sys).
By combining the SN Ia data with cosmic microwave background constraints, we
find $w=-0.938 \pm 0.053$, consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. With 463
spectroscopically classified SNe Ia alone, we measure $w=-0.933\pm0.061$. Using
the more homogeneous and better-characterized Foundation sample gives a 55%
reduction in the systematic uncertainty attributed to SN Ia sample selection
biases. Although use of just a single photometric system at low and high
redshift increases the impact of photometric calibration uncertainties in this
analysis, previous low-$z$ samples may have correlated calibration
uncertainties that were neglected in past studies. The full Foundation sample
will observe up to 800 SNe to anchor the LSST and WFIRST Hubble diagrams.

effective g-factors of different energy bands and show that spin-orbit coupling
effects, responsible for the spin splittings, also have noticeable
contributions to the g-factors. Within the Landau level picture, we show that
the nonlinear Zeeman splitting recently explained in magneto photoluminescence
experiments for InP nanowires by Tedeschi et al. [Phys. Rev. B 99, 161204

nonlinear features stem from the peculiar coupling of the A and B valence
bands, as a consequence of the interplay between the wurtzite crystal symmetry
and the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by the external magnetic field.
Moreover, we develop an analytical model to describe the experimental nonlinear
Zeeman splitting and apply it to InP and GaAs data. Extrapolating our fitted
results, we found that the Zeeman splitting of InP reaches a maximum value,
which is a prediction that could be probed at higher magnetic fields.

have been conducted in the 4-8 GHz band, where traditional radio
interferometers are typically most sensitive. Hence, the nature of UCD radio
emission at low frequencies ($\lesssim 1.4\,\mathrm{GHz}$) remains relatively
unexplored, but can probe optically thick emission, and regions of lower
magnetic field strengths -- regimes not accessible to higher-frequency
observations. In this work, we present the results from Giant Metrewave Radio

observations of 1213 galaxies from the SAMI Galaxy Survey show that 11% of

degrees in both field/group and cluster environments. Using SAMI morphological
classifications and Sersic indices, the misalignment fraction is 45+/-6% in
early-type galaxies, but only 5+/-1% in late-type galaxies. The distribution of
position angle offsets is used to test the physical drivers of this difference.
Slower dynamical settling time of the gas in elliptical stellar mass
distributions accounts for a small increase in misalignment in early-type
galaxies. However, gravitational dynamical settling time is insufficient to
fully explain the observed differences between early- and late-type galaxies in
the distributions of the gas/stellar position angle offsets. LTGs have
primarily accreted gas close to aligned rather than settled from misaligned
based on analysis of the skewed distribution of PA offsets compared to a
dynamical settling model. Local environment density is less important in
setting the misalignment fractions than morphology, suggesting that mergers are
not the main source of accreted gas in these disks. Cluster environments are
found to have gas misalignment driven primarily by cluster processes not by gas
accretion.

an emergence of a region where the SC transition temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$)
decreased in samples with higher Cu concentrations and found that the region

dependence of the upper critical field ($H_\mathrm{C2}$) of Cu-doped TaSe$_3$

and the size of the anomaly was enhanced with increasing Cu concentration but
the temperature at which the anomaly appeared hardly changed. This result of
the anomaly and the local suppression of SC imply that the induced CDWs are

ensembling smaller models while adversarially training the entire ensemble as a

M_{\rm core}^{0.51 \pm 0.07}$, which supports the notion that BSS formation is
linked to a population's binary fraction. At low stellar collision rates, the
mass-normalised number of BSSs does not appear to depend on the collision rate,

the parallel object-oriented framework has the potential to drastically reduce
the cost of parallel programming. We also show that standard sequential

image classification, an adversarial example is a carefully modified image that
is visually imperceptible to the original image but can cause DNN model to
misclassify it. Training the network with Gaussian noise is an effective
technique to perform model regularization, thus improving model robustness
against input variation. Inspired by this classical method, we explore to
utilize the regularization characteristic of noise injection to improve DNN's
robustness against adversarial attack. In this work, we propose
Parametric-Noise-Injection (PNI) which involves trainable Gaussian noise
injection at each layer on either activation or weights through solving the
min-max optimization problem, embedded with adversarial training. These
parameters are trained explicitly to achieve improved robustness. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses trainable noise injection to
improve network robustness against adversarial attacks, rather than manually
configuring the injected noise level through cross-validation. The extensive
results show that our proposed PNI technique effectively improves the

of manipulators under perception uncertainty. In both these applications, the
underlying chance constraints are defined over highly non-linear and non-convex

subsequent launch of the wind and the wind's large scale evolution subject to
tidal and non-inertial forces. We run simulations for planets of 0.263 and 0.07
Jupiter masses and stellar fluxes of $2 \times 10^{13}$ and $2 \times 10^{14}$
photons/cm^2/s. Our results reveal new, potentially observable planetary wind
flow patterns, including the development, in some cases, of an extended neutral
tail lagging behind the planet in its orbit.

however is that neither the size nor the inference speed of the pruned network

traditional neural network training as it consists of a learnable masking

distillation. We also provide insights on how to prune a residual network and
how this can lead to new architectures. Experimental results reveal that CNNs
pruned with our method are more accurate and less compute-hungry than

traditional electromagnetic shower theory at the extreme conditions. It is also

big challenge to design, manage and implement effective demand response and
management strategies. Therefore, an accurate PV power output forecast is an
utmost importance to allow seamless integration and a higher level of
penetration. In this research, a neural network ensemble (NNE) scheme is
proposed, which is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) trained
feedforward neural network (FNN). Five different FFN structures with varying
network complexities are used to achieve the diverse and accurate forecast
results. These results are combined using trim aggregation after removing the
upper and lower forecast error extremes. Correlated variables namely wavelet
transformed historical power output of PV, solar irradiance, wind speed,
temperature and humidity are applied as inputs to the multivariate NNE.
Clearness index is used to classify days into clear, cloudy and partial cloudy
days. Test case studies are designed to predict the solar output for these days
selected from all seasons. The performance of the proposed framework is
analyzed by applying training data set of different resolution, length and
quality from seven solar PV sites of the University of Queensland, Australia.
The forecast results demonstrate that the proposed framework improves the
forecast accuracy significantly in comparison with individual and benchmark
models.

eigenvectors. Then we calculate the properties of these coherent states,
looking for classical or non-classical behaviour. We calculate the energy
expectation as a function of $|z|$. We plot position probability densities for
the coherent states and for the even and odd cat states formed from these

For these coherent states on one arm of a beamsplitter, we calculate the two

introduction of demand side management strategies. An incremental improvement
in grid-level demand forecast of anomalous days can potentially save millions
of dollars. However, due to an increasing penetration of renewable energy
resources and their dependency on several meteorological and exogenous
variables, accurate load forecasting of anomalous days has now become very
challenging. To improve the prediction accuracy of the load forecasting, an
ensemble forecast framework (ENFF) is proposed with a systematic combination of
three multiple predictors, namely Elman neural network (ELM), feedforward
neural network (FNN) and radial basis function (RBF) neural network. These
predictors are trained using global particle swarm optimization (GPSO) to
improve their prediction capability in the ENFF. The outputs of individual
predictors are combined using a trim aggregation technique by removing

recently. It is desirable to achieve the maximal test accuracy under given
inference budget constraints when deploying a pre-trained model. Network
pruning is a commonly used technique while it may produce irregular sparse
models that can hardly gain actual speed-up. Group convolution is a promising
pruning target due to its regular structure; however, incorporating such
structure into the pruning procedure is challenging. It is because structural
constraints are hard to describe and can make pruning intractable to solve. The
need for configuring group convolution architecture, i.e., the number of
groups, that maximises test accuracy also increases difficulty.
  This paper presents an efficient method to address this challenge. We
formulate group convolution pruning as finding the optimal channel permutation
to impose structural constraints and solve it efficiently by heuristics. We
also apply local search to exploring group configuration based on estimated
pruning cost to maximise test accuracy. Compared to prior work, results show
that our method produces competitive group convolution models for various tasks
within a shorter pruning period and enables rapid group configuration
exploration subject to inference budget constraints.

anchoring in soil. The growth and development of root systems contribute to
colonizing the surrounding soil and optimizing the access to resources. It is
usually admitted that the variability of plant root architecture results from
the combination of genetic, physiological and environmental factors, in
particular soil mechanical impedance. However this last factor has never been
investigated at the soil grain scale. In this paper, we are interested in the
effect of the disordered texture of granular soils on the evolution of external
forces experienced by root cap. We introduce a numerical model in which the
root is modeled as a flexible self-elongating tube that probes a soil composed
of solid particles. By means of extensive simulations, we show that the forces
exerted on the root cap during its growth reflect interparticle force chains.
Our extensive simulations also show that the mean force declines exponentially
with root flexibility, the highest force corresponding to the soil hardness.
Furthermore, we find that this functional dependence is characterized by a
single parameter that combines the granular structure and root bending
stiffness. This finding will be useful to further address the biological issues
of mechanosensing and thigmomorphogenesis in plant roots.

the form of collective spin excitations of magnetic materials with the readout
through a microwave cavity. Here, we present a new, general, theoretical
treatment of such experiments in a Hamiltonian formulation for strongly coupled
magnons and photons, which hybridise as cavity-magnon polaritons. Such strongly
coupled systems have an extended measurable dispersive regime. Thus, we extend
the analysis and operation of such experiments into the dispersive regime,
which allows any ferromagnetic haloscope to achieve improved bandwidth with
respect to the axion mass parameter space. This experiment was implemented in a
cryogenic setup, and initial search results are presented setting laboratory
limits on the axion-electron coupling strength of $g_{aee}>3.7\times10^{-9}$ in
the range $33.79~\mu$eV$< m_a<33.94~\mu$eV with $95\%$ confidence. The
potential bandwidth of the Ferromagnetic haloscope was calculated to be in two
bands, the first of about $1$GHz around $8.24$GHz (or $4.1~\mu$eV mass range
around $34.1~\mu$eV) and the second of about $1.6$GHz around $10$GHz
($6.6~\mu$eV mass range around $41.4~\mu$eV). Frequency tuning may also be
easily achieved via an external magnetic field which changes the ferromagnetic
resonant frequency with respect to the cavity frequency. The requirements
necessary for future improvements to reach the DFSZ axion model band are
discussed in the paper.

with each other to materialize as electron-positron pairs in the magnetosphere.
Such pairs efficiently screen the electric field along the magnetic field
lines, when the accretion rate is typically greater than 0.03-0.3% of the
Eddington rate. However, when the accretion rate becomes smaller than this

rotationally induced Goldreich-Julian density. In such a charge-starved
magnetosphere, an electric field arises along the magnetic field lines to
accelerate charged leptons into ultra-relativistic energies, leading to an

impressive, the theoretical implementation of gauge invariance is less

algorithms for training deep neural networks, which have been pointed out to be
divergent even in the convex setting via a few simple counterexamples. Many
attempts, such as decreasing an adaptive learning rate, adopting a big batch
size, incorporating a temporal decorrelation technique, seeking an analogous
surrogate, etc., have been tried to promote Adam/RMSProp-type algorithms to
converge. In contrast with existing approaches, we introduce an alternative
easy-to-check sufficient condition, which merely depends on the parameters of
the base learning rate and combinations of historical second-order moments, to
guarantee the global convergence of generic Adam/RMSProp for solving
large-scale non-convex stochastic optimization. Moreover, we show that the
convergences of several variants of Adam, such as AdamNC, AdaEMA, etc., can be
directly implied via the proposed sufficient condition in the non-convex
setting. In addition, we illustrate that Adam is essentially a specifically
weighted AdaGrad with exponential moving average momentum, which provides a
novel perspective for understanding Adam and RMSProp. This observation coupled
with this sufficient condition gives much deeper interpretations on their
divergences. At last, we validate the sufficient condition by applying Adam and
RMSProp to tackle a certain counterexample and train deep neural networks.
Numerical results are exactly in accord with our theoretical analysis.

notion of Price of Signal-Anticipation (PoSA) to characterize the impact of

PoSA scales with the size, topology, and heterogeneity of the distribution
network for a few network settings. Our results show that the PoSA is upper
bounded by a constant and the average PoSA per node will go to zero as the size
of the network increases. This is desirable as it means that the PoSA will not

challenging topic in discovering and designing drugs, agrochemicals and
nutritional supplements. The problem is challenging because the rate of P450
metabolism depends upon both the intrinsic chemical reactivity of the site and
the protein-ligand geometry that is energetically accessible in the active site
of a given P450 isozyme. We have addressed this problem using a two-level
screening system. The first level implements an empirical QSAR-based scoring
function employing the local chemical motifs to characterize the intrinsic
reactivity. The second level uses molecular docking and molecular mechanics to
account for the geometrical effects, including induced-fit effects in the
protein which can be very important in P450 interactions with ligands. This
approach has achieved high accuracy for both the P450 3A4 and 2D6 isoforms. In
identifying at least one metabolic site in the top two ranked positions, the
prediction rate can reach as high as 92.7% for the test set of isoform 3A4. For
the 2D6 isoform, 100% accuracy is achieved on this basic evaluation metric,
and, because this active site is considerably smaller and more selective than
3A4, very high precision is attained for full prediction of all metabolic
sites. The method also requires considerably less CPU time than our previous
efforts, which involved a large number of expensive simulations for each ligand
to be evaluated. After screening using the empirical score function, only a few
best candidates are left for each ligand, making the number of necessary
estimations in the second level very small, which significantly reduces the
computation time.

  In this work, we give the first nearly-linear time algorithms for
high-dimensional robust mean estimation. Specifically, we focus on
distributions with (i) known covariance and sub-gaussian tails, and (ii)
unknown bounded covariance. Given $N$ samples on $\mathbb{R}^d$, an
$\epsilon$-fraction of which may be arbitrarily corrupted, our algorithms run
in time $\tilde{O}(Nd) / \mathrm{poly}(\epsilon)$ and approximate the true mean
within the information-theoretically optimal error, up to constant factors.
Previous robust algorithms with comparable error guarantees have running times
$\tilde{\Omega}(N d^2)$, for $\epsilon = \Omega(1)$.
  Our algorithms rely on a natural family of SDPs parameterized by our current
guess $\nu$ for the unknown mean $\mu^\star$. We give a win-win analysis
establishing the following: either a near-optimal solution to the primal SDP
yields a good candidate for $\mu^\star$ -- independent of our current guess
$\nu$ -- or the dual SDP yields a new guess $\nu'$ whose distance from
$\mu^\star$ is smaller by a constant factor. We exploit the special structure
of the corresponding SDPs to show that they are approximately solvable in
nearly-linear time. Our approach is quite general, and we believe it can also

the dynamic, uncertain nature of the environment and the variability in

share control with the operator, we can achieve near-optimal performance by
augmenting the operator's input and compensate for the factors resulting in
degraded performance. What this solution does not consider though is the human
input latency and errors caused by potential hardware failures that can occur

input latency and erroneous odometry feedback. We conduct a validation study

film of FeSe epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 substrates has triggered a flurry of
activity in the field of superconductivity. It raised the hope to find more
conventional high-Tc superconductors which are purely driven by the
electron-phonon interaction at ambient pressure. Here we report the
experimental evidence from the measurement of scanning tunneling spectroscopy
for the interface enhanced high-Tc superconductivity in the Pb thin film
islands grown on SrTiO3 substrates. The superconducting energy gap of the Pb
film is found to depend on both the thickness and the volume of the islands.
The largest superconducting energy gap is found to be about 10 meV, which is 7
times larger than that in the bulk Pb. The corresponding superconducting
transition temperature, estimated by fitting the temperature dependence of the
gap values using the BCS formula, is found to be 47 K, again 7 times higher
than that of the bulk Pb.

infinite depth under the influence of a shear current varying linearly with
depth. An analytical solution is permitted via integration of the Euler
equations. Although similar problems were investigated in the 1960's and 70's
for special cases of resonance, this is to our knowledge the first general wave
interaction (mode coupling) solution derived to second order with a shear
current present. Wave interactions are integrable in a spectral convolution to
yield the second order dynamics of initial value problems.
  To second order, irrotational wave dynamics interacts with the background
vorticity field in a way that creates new vortex structures. A notable example
is the large parallel vortices which drive Langmuir circulation as oblique
plane waves interact with an ocean current. We also investigate the effect on
wave pairs which are misaligned with the shear current. In contrast to a
conjecture by Leibovich (1983) we find similar, but skewed, vortex structures
in every case except when the mean wave direction is perpendicular to the
direction of the current. Similar nonlinear wave-shear interactions are found
to also generate near-field vortex structures in the Cauchy-Poisson problem
with an initial surface elevation. These interactions create further groups of
dispersive ring waves in addition to those present in linear theory.
  The second order solution is derived in a general manner which accommodates
any initial condition through mode coupling over a continuous wave spectrum. It
is therefore applicable to a range of problems including special cases of
resonance. As a by--product of the general theory, a simple expression for the
Stokes drift due to a monochromatic wave propagating at oblique angle with a
current of uniform vorticity is derived, for the first time to our knowledge.

various space missions to comets, it has become evident that comets have a much
higher dust-to-ice ratio than previously thought and that most of the dust mass
is ejected in large particles. Here we report on new comet-simulation
experiments dedicated to the study of the ejection of dust aggregates caused by
the sublimation of solid water ice. We find that dust ejection exactly occurs
when the pressure of the water vapor above the ice surface exceeds the tensile
strength plus the gravitational load of the covering dust layer. Furthermore,
we observed the ejection of clusters of dust aggregates, whose sizes increase
with increasing thickness of the ice-covering dust-aggregate layer. In
addition, the trajectories of the ejected aggregates suggest that most of the
aggregates obtained a non-vanishing initial velocity from the ejection event.

the connectivity of the linkers to the molecular core can be controlled to

molecules has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Here we
study the connectivity dependence of the Wigner delay time of single-molecule
junctions and the connectivity dependence of superconducting proximity effects,
which occur when the external electrodes are replaced by superconductors.
Although absolute values of transport properties depend on complex and often
uncontrolled details of the coupling between the molecule and electrodes, we
demonstrate that ratios of transport properties can be predicted using tables
of 'magic numbers,' which capture the connectivity dependence of
superconducting proximity effects and Wigner delay times within molecules.
These numbers are calculated easily, without the need for large-scale
computations. For normal-molecule-superconducting junctions, we find that the
electrical conductance is proportional to the fourth power of their magic
numbers, whereas for superconducting-molecule-superconducting junctions, the
critical current is proportional to the square of their magic numbers. For more
conventional normal-molecule-normal junctions, we demonstrate that delay time
ratios can be obtained from products of magic number tables.

making the point cloud convolution-favored and ordered so as to fit into deep

exploiting connectivities of the 2D grids to form mesh-based surfaces. Second,
we propose an encoder-decoder network that generates such kind of multiple

able to interpret discrepancy over 3D surfaces as opposed to 2D projective

second sample characterization mode, a custom-built microscope was integrated
into the system and the computerized work flow. Custom software includes
automated control and measurement routines with a straightforward user
interface for selecting parameters and monitoring experimental progress. This
cost-effective modular system can be implemented on any research-grade
spectrometer with a standard sample compartment for new bioanalytical chemistry
studies. The system was validated and optimized for use with microfluidic flow
cells containing growing Pseudomonas sp. bacterial biofilms. The
complementarity among the scan positioning accuracy, measurement spatial
resolution and the microchannel dimensions paves the way for parallel
biological assays with real-time control over environmental parameters and
minimal manual labor. By rotating the channel orientation relative to the beam
path, the system could also be used for acquisition of linear biochemical maps
and stitched microscope images along the channel length.

crucial role in the recent development of circuit quantum acoustodynamics

atom and SAWs beyond the weak coupling regime, focusing on the role of the
interdigital transducer (IDT) that enables the coupling. We find a parameter
regime in which the IDT acts as a cavity for the atom, rather than an antenna.
In other words, the atom forms its own cavity. Similar to an atom coupled to an
explicit cavity, this regime is characterized by vacuum-Rabi splitting, as the
atom hybridizes with the phononic vacuum inside the IDT. This hybridization is
possible because of the interdigitated coupling, which has a large spatial
extension, and the slow propagation speed of SAWs. We work out a criterion for
entering this regime from a model based on standard circuit-quantization
techniques, taking only material parameters as inputs. Most notably, we find
this regime hard to avoid for an atom on top of a strong piezoelectric
material, such as LiNbO$_3$. The SAW-coupled atom on top of LiNbO$_3$ can thus
be regarded as an atom-cavity-bath system. On weaker piezoelectric materials,
the number of IDT electrodes need to be large in order to reach this regime.

applications. As a partner technique, model compression on neural networks has
been widely investigated to gear the needs that the deep learning algorithms

Currently, both the tasks of architecture design and model compression require
expertise tricks and tedious trials. In this paper, we integrate these two
tasks into one unified framework, which enables the joint architecture search
with quantization (compression) policies for neural networks. This method is
named JASQ. Here our goal is to automatically find a compact neural network
model with high performance that is suitable for mobile devices. Technically, a
multi-objective evolutionary search algorithm is introduced to search the
models under the balance between model size and performance accuracy. In
experiments, we find that our approach outperforms the methods that search only
for architectures or only for quantization policies. 1) Specifically, given
existing networks, our approach can provide them with learning-based
quantization policies, and outperforms their 2 bits, 4 bits, 8 bits, and 16
bits counterparts. It can yield higher accuracies than the float models, for
example, over 1.02% higher accuracy on MobileNet-v1. 2) What is more, under the
balance between model size and performance accuracy, two models are obtained
with joint search of architectures and quantization policies: a high-accuracy

safety of potentially promising drugs in humans. Conventional methods for phase
I dose-escalation trials are based on a single treatment schedule only. More
recently, however, multiple schedules are more frequently investigated in the
same trial. Here, we consider sequential phase I trials, where the trial
proceeds with a new schedule (e.g. daily or weekly dosing) once the dose
escalation with another schedule has been completed. The aim is to utilize the
information from both the completed and the ongoing dose-escalation trial to
inform decisions on the dose level for the next dose cohort. For this purpose,
we adapted the time-to-event pharmacokinetics (TITE-PK) model, which were
originally developed for simultaneous investigation of multiple schedules.
TITE-PK integrates information from multiple schedules using a pharmacokinetics
(PK) model. In a simulation study, the developed appraoch is compared to the
bridging continual reassessment method and the Bayesian logistic regression
model using a meta-analytic-prior. TITE-PK results in better performance than
comparators in terms of recommending acceptable dose and avoiding overly toxic
doses for sequential phase I trials in most of the scenarios considered.
Furthermore, better performance of TITE-PK is achieved while requiring similar
number of patients in the simulated trials. For the scenarios involving one
schedule, TITE-PK displays similar performance with alternatives in terms of
acceptable dose recommendations. The \texttt{R} and \texttt{Stan} code for the
implementation of an illustrative sequential phase I trial example is publicly

variance in Monte Carlo simulations. In many practical problems, however, the
use of IS method may result in unbounded variance, and thus fail to provide
reliable estimates. To address the issue, we propose a method which can prevent
the risk of unbounded variance; the proposed method performs the standard IS
for the integral of interest in a region only in which the IS weight is bounded
and use the result as an approximation to the original integral. It can be
verified that the resulting estimator has a finite variance. Moreover, we also
provide a normality test based method to identify the region with bounded IS
weight (termed as the safe region) from the samples drawn from the standard IS
distribution. With numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed method
can yield rather reliable estimate when the standard IS fails, and it also
outperforms the defensive IS, a popular method to prevent unbounded variance.

that straddles the corotation resonance (where the particles mean motion
matches the spin rate of the body). The disk material inside the corotation
radius migrates onto the body, while the material outside the corotation radius
is pushed outside the 1/2 resonance, where the particles complete one
revolution while the body completes two rotations. Consequently, the existence
of rings around non-axisymmetric bodies requires that the 1/2 resonance resides
inside the Roche limit of the body, favoring fast rotators for being surrounded

mass-radius and mass-compactness relations with Maxwell and Gibbs construction
for hybrid stars with transitions from nuclear matter to two or three-flavor
quark matter, including sequential transitions. Not only can stable hybrid
stars with either two or three-flavor quark matter mimic neutron stars (the
traditional masquerade), it appears as well difficult to distinguish two-flavor
from three-flavor quark matter even in cases where a phase transition can be
said to have occurred, as in the presence of a distinct kink in the mass-radius

the transition into an unstable branch can be caused by either a transition
from a nuclear to unstable quark matter or the sequential transition from
nuclear to stable but ""masquerading"" two-flavor to unstable three-flavor quark
matter. Addressing chiral restoration as well as quark deconfinement in a model
of the phase transition, as the vBag does, adds further flexibility to the

crucial if the outcomes of binary evolutionary channels are to be quantified.
The massive cluster Westerlund 1 hosts a rich population of X-ray bright stars
where the emission is thought to derive from the wind collision zones of
massive binaries. Selected on this basis, we present the results of a
multiwavelength analysis of the X-ray luminous O stars Wd1-27 and -30a. We find
both to be early/mid-O hypergiants with luminosities, temperatures and masses
significantly in excess of other early stars within Wd1, hence qualifying as
massive blue stragglers. The nature of Wd1-27 remains uncertain but the
detection of radial velocity changes and the X-ray properties of Wd1-30a
suggest that it is a binary. Analysis of Gaia proper motion and parallactic
data indicates that both are cluster members; we also provide a membership list
for Wd1 based on this analysis. The presence of hypergiants of spectral types O
to M within Wd1 cannot be understood via single-star evolution. We suppose that
the early-B and mid-O hypergiants formed via binary-induced mass-stripping of
the primary and mass-transfer to the secondary, respectively. This implies that
for a subset of objects massive star-formation may be regarded as a two-stage
process, with binary-driven mass-transfer or merger yielding stars with masses

for automated vulnerability detection. Given a seed file (as a sequence of
bits), CGF randomly flips, deletes or bits to generate new files. CGF
iteratively constructs (and fuzzes) a seed corpus by retaining those generated
files which enhance coverage. However, random bitflips are unlikely to produce
valid files (or valid chunks in files), for applications processing complex
file formats.
  In this work, we introduce smart greybox fuzzing (SGF) which leverages a
high-level structural representation of the seed file to generate new files. We
define innovative mutation operators that work on the virtual file structure
rather than on the bit level which allows SGF to explore completely new input
domains while maintaining file validity. We introduce a novel validity-based
power schedule that enables SGF to spend more time generating files that are
more likely to pass the parsing stage of the program, which can expose
vulnerabilities much deeper in the processing logic.
  Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SGF. On several libraries
that parse structurally complex files, our tool AFLSmart explores substantially
more paths (up to 200%) and exposes more vulnerabilities than baseline AFL. Our
tool AFLSmart has discovered 42 zero-day vulnerabilities in widely-used,

control has attracted much attention, because it resolved the paradox
concerning Maxwell's demon. Most studies, however, assume that their target
systems are isolated or isothermal. In this paper, by considering a
nonisothermal system, we generalize the Sagawa-Ueda-Jarzynski relation, which
involves measurement and feedback control, and apply it to a realistic model.
Furthermore, when the temperature profile is quadratic, we see that the system
is governed by Tsallis statistical mechanics. In addition, we show that our

of surprise in elections. A voter is surprised if their estimate of the winner
(assumed to be based on a combination of the preferences of their social
connections and popular media predictions) is different from the true winner. A
voter's social connections are assumed to consist of contacts on social media
and geographically proximate people. We propose a simple mathematical model for
combining the global information (traditional media) as well as the local
information (local neighbourhood) of a voter in the case of a two-candidate
election. We show that an unbiased, influential media can nullify the effect of
filter bubbles and result in a less surprised populace. Surprisingly, an
influential media source biased towards the winners of the election also
results in a less surprised populace. Our model shows that elections will be
unsurprising for all of the voters with a high probability under certain
assumptions on the social connection model in the presence of an influential,
unbiased traditional media source. Our experiments with the UK-EU referendum
(popularly known as Brexit) dataset support our theoretical predictions. Since
surprising elections can lead to significant economic movements, it is a
worthwhile endeavour to figure out the causes of surprising elections.

planetesimal disc does not reproduce the data either. Instead, we propose a
two-population model, comprising a Kuiper-Belt-like structure of a

high-eccentricity population of comets (""scattered disc""). We argue that such a

2017) revealed an elongated shape with the longest axis comparable to Pluto's
mean diameter. The chords also indicate a ring around Haumea's equatorial
plane, where its largest moon, Hi'iaka, is also located. The Haumea occultation
size estimate (equivalent diameter 1595 km) is larger than previous radiometric
solutions (in the range between 1150 and 1350 km), which lowers the object's
density to about 1.8 gcm-3, a value closer to the densities of other large
TNOs. We present unpublished and also reprocessed Herschel and Spitzer MIR and
FIR measurements. We compare 100 and 160um thermal lightcurve amplitudes -
originating from Haumea itself - with models of the total measured system
fluxes (ring, satellite, Haumea) from 24-350um. The combination with results
derived from the occultation measurements show that Haumea's crystalline water
ice surface must have a thermal inertia of ~5 SIu. We also have indications
that the satellites (at least Hi'iaka) must have high geometric albedos >=0.5,
otherwise the derived thermal amplitude would be inconsistent with the total
measured system fluxes at 24, 70, 100, 160, 250, and 350um. The high albedos
imply sizes of about 300 and 150 km for Hi'iaka and Namaka, respectively,
indicating unexpectedly high densities >1.0 gcm-3 for TNOs this small, and the
assumed collisional formation from Haumea's icy crust. We also estimated the
thermal emission of the ring for the time period 1980-2030, showing that the
contribution during the Spitzer and Herschel epochs was small, but not
negligible. Due to the progressive opening of the ring plane, the ring emission
will be increasing in the next decade when JWST is operational. In the MIRI
25.5um band it will also be possible to obtain a very high-quality thermal
lightcurve to test the derived Haumea properties.

phenomena when an electronic transition follows different trajectories. Such
interference results in asymmetric absorption lines such as Fano resonances,
and gives rise to secondary effects like electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) when multiple optical transitions are pumped. Few
solid-state systems show quantum interference and EIT, with quantum-well
intersubband transitions in the IR offering the most promising avenue to date
to devices exploiting optical gain without inversion. Quantum interference is
usually hampered by inhomogeneous broadening of electronic transitions, making
it challenging to achieve in solids at visible wavelengths and elevated
temperatures. However, disorder effects can be mitigated by raising the
oscillator strength of atom-like electronic transitions - excitons - which
arise in monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Quantum
interference, probed by second-harmonic generation (SHG), emerges in monolayer
WSe2, without a cavity, splitting the SHG spectrum. The splitting exhibits
spectral anticrossing behaviour, and is related to the number of Rabi flops the
strongly driven system undergoes. The SHG power-law exponent deviates strongly
from the canonical value of 2, showing a Fano-like wavelength dependence which
is retained at room temperature. The work opens opportunities in solid-state
quantum-nonlinear optics for optical mixing, gain without inversion and
quantum-information processing.

state lepton energy for all of available electron QE data on Lithium,
Carbon+Oxygen, Aluminum, Calcium+Argon, Iron and Lead+Gold. The first
parameter, the removal energy $\epsilon^{P,N}$ is extracted from exclusive
ee$^{\prime}$p spectral function data. The second parameter $V_{eff}$, which
accounts for the interaction of final state leptons and protons with the
Coulomb potential of the nucleus, is available from published comparisons of
inclusive QE electron and positron cross section. We extract the third

final state nucleon with the optical potential of the spectator nucleus (FSI),
by fitting all available inclusive QE cross sections on nuclear targets. Here
$q_3$ is the three momentum transfer. With these three parameters we can model
the energy of final state electrons and nucleons for all available electron QE

momentum with the environment in which dark matter (DM) haloes form. The
deviations introduced by late non-linearities are commonly thought as noise in
the model. In this work, we analyze a cosmological simulation looking for
systematics on these deviations, finding that the classification of DM haloes
according to their angular momentum growth results in samples with different
internal alignment, spin parameter distribution and assembly history. Based on
this classification, we obtain that low mass haloes are embedded in denser
environments if they have acquired angular momentum below the TTT expectations
(L haloes), whereas at high masses enhanced clustering is typically associated
with higher angular momentum growths (W haloes). Additionally, we find that the
low mass signal has a weak dependence on the direction, whereas the high mass
signal is entirely due to the structure perpendicular to the angular momentum.
Finally, we study the anisotropy of the matter distribution around haloes as a
function of their mass. We find that the angular momentum direction of W (L)
haloes remains statistically perpendicular (parallel) to the surrounding
structure across the mass range
$11<\mathrm{log}(M/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot})<14$, whereas haloes following TTT
show a ""spin flip"" mass consistent with previously reported values ($\sim 5
\times 10^{12}$ $h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot$). Hence, whether the spin flip mass of
the deviated samples is highly shifted or straightly undefined, our results
indicate that is remarkably connected to the haloes angular momentum growth.

objects to rapidly exchange energy. When the two objects are distant, the
energy transfer between the donor and acceptor species takes place via the
exchange of a virtual photon. On the contrary, recent ab initio calculations
have revealed that the presence of a third passive species can significantly
enhance the ICD rate at short distances due to the effects of electronic wave
function overlap and charge transfer states [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 083403

showing that a mediator atom can have a significant influence at much larger
distances. In this regime, this impact is due to the scattering of virtual
photons off the mediator, allowing for simple analytical results and being
manifest in a distinct geometry-dependence which includes interference effects.
As a striking example, we show that in the retarded regime ICD can be
substantially enhanced or suppressed depending on the position of the

challenging and computationally expensive task. Current satellite-based
approaches to predict thunderstorms are usually based on the analysis of the
observed brightness temperatures in different spectral channels and emit a
warning if a critical threshold is reached. Recent progress in data science
however demonstrates that machine learning can be successfully applied to many
research fields in science, especially in areas dealing with large datasets. We
therefore present a new approach to the problem of predicting thunderstorms
based on machine learning. The core idea of our work is to use the error of
two-dimensional optical flow algorithms applied to images of meteorological
satellites as a feature for machine learning models. We interpret that optical
flow error as an indication of convection potentially leading to thunderstorms
and lightning. To factor in spatial proximity we use various manual convolution
steps. We also consider effects such as the time of day or the geographic
location. We train different tree classifier models as well as a neural network
to predict lightning within the next few hours (called nowcasting in
meteorology) based on these features. In our evaluation section we compare the
predictive power of the different models and the impact of different features
on the classification result. Our results show a high accuracy of 96% for
predictions over the next 15 minutes which slightly decreases with increasing
forecast period but still remains above 83% for forecasts of up to five hours.
The high false positive rate of nearly 6% however needs further investigation
to allow for an operational use of our approach.

Readily available, accurately labeled synthetic data has the potential to
reduce the effort. However, to successfully exploit synthetic data, current
state-of-the-art methods still require a large amount of labeled real data. In
this work, we remove this requirement by learning to map from the features of
real data to the features of synthetic data mainly using a large amount of
synthetic and unlabeled real data. We exploit unlabeled data using two
auxiliary objectives, which enforce that (i) the mapped representation is pose
specific and (ii) at the same time, the distributions of real and synthetic
data are aligned. While pose specifity is enforced by a self-supervisory signal
requiring that the representation is predictive for the appearance from
different views, distributions are aligned by an adversarial term. In this way,
we can significantly improve the results of the baseline system, which does not
use unlabeled data and outperform many recent approaches already with about 1%
of the labeled real data. This presents a step towards faster deployment of
learning based hand pose estimation, making it accessible for a larger range of
applications.

yeast cell-cycle process behaves like an excitable system containing three
well-coupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis
events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be separated into G1/S
phase module, early M module and late M phase module, where the positive
feedbacks in each module and the interactions among the modules play important
role. If the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the
saddle-node bifurcations, there is a critical slowing down or ghost effect.
This can provide the cell-cycle process with a sufficient duration for each
event and an attractive manifold for the state checking of the completion of
DNA replication and mitosis; moreover, the fluctuation in the early
module/event is forbidden to transmit to the latter module/event. Our results
suggest both a fundamental structure of cell-cycle regulatory network and a

formation. Our aim is to explore the effect of the metal-line cooling on the
thermodynamics of the star-formation process. We explore the effect of changing
the metallicty of the gas from $Z/Z_{\odot}=10^{-4}$ to $Z/Z_{\odot}=10^{-2}$.
Furthermore, we explore the implications of using the observational abundance
pattern of a CEMP-no star, which have been considered to be the missing
second-generation stars, the so-called Pop. III.2 stars. In order to pursue our
aim, we modelled the microphysics by employing the public astrochemistry
package KROME, using a chemical network which includes sixteen chemical species
(H, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, He, He$^{+}$, He$^{++}$, e$^{-}$, H$_{2}$, H$_{2}^{+}$,
C, C$^{+}$, O, O$^{+}$, Si, Si$^{+}$, and Si$^{++}$). We couple KROME with the
fully three-dimensional Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GRADSPH.
With this framework we investigate the collapse of a metal-enhanced cloud,
exploring the fragmentation process and the formation of stars. We found that
the metallicity has a clear impact on the thermodynamics of the collapse,
allowing the cloud to reach the CMB temperature floor for a metallicity
$Z/Z_{\odot}=10^{-2}$, which is in agreement with previous work. Moreover, we
found that adopting the abundance pattern given by the star SMSS
J031300.36-670839.3 the thermodynamics behavior is very similar to simulations
with a metallicity of $Z/Z_{\odot}=10^{-2}$, due to the high carbon abundance.
As long as only metal line cooling is considered, our results support the
metallicity threshold proposed by previous works, which will very likely
regulate the first episode of fragmentation and potentially determine the
masses of the resulting star clusters.

emergence of an imbalance in the spin density transverse to a charge flow in a
sample under voltage bias. This study points to a novel way for an ultrafast
generation and tuning of a unidirectional nonlinear spin Hall current by means
of subpicosecond laser pulses of optical vortices. When interacting with
matter, the optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried by the vortex and
quantified by its topological charge is transferred to the charge carriers. The
residual spin-orbital coupling in the sample together with confinement effects
allow exploiting the absorbed optical OAM for spatio-temporally controlling the
spin channels. Both the non-linear spin Hall current and the dynamical spin
Hall angle increase for a higher optical topological charge. The reason is the
transfer of a higher amount of OAM and the enhancement of the effective
spin-orbit interaction strength. No bias voltage is needed. We demonstrate that
the spin Hall current can be all-optically generated in an open circuit
geometry for ring-structured samples. These results follow from a full-fledged
propagation of the spin-dependent quantum dynamics on a time-space grid coupled
to the phononic environment. The findings point to a versatile and controllable
tool for the ultrafast generation of spin accumulations with a variety of
applications such as a source for ultrafast spin transfer torque and charge and
spin current pulse emitter.

in computer vision, as it exhibits various levels of foreground/background
ambiguities. To reduce such ambiguities, we propose a novel formulation via
exploiting foreground and background context as well as their complementary
constraint. Under this formulation, a unified objective function is further
defined to encode each cue. For implementation, we design a Complementary
Segmentation Network (CSNet) with two separate branches, which can
simultaneously encode the foreground and background information along with
joint spatial constraints. The CSNet is trained on massive images with manually
annotated salient objects in an end-to-end manner. By applying CSNet on each
video frame, the spatial foreground and background maps can be initialized. To
enforce temporal consistency effectively and efficiently, we divide each frame
into superpixels and construct neighborhood reversible flow that reflects the
most reliable temporal correspondences between superpixels in far-away frames.
With such flow, the initialized foregroundness and backgroundness can be
propagated along the temporal dimension so that primary video objects gradually
pop-out and distractors are well suppressed. Extensive experimental results on
three video datasets show that the proposed approach achieves impressive
performance in comparisons with 18 state-of-the-art models.

generation of non volatile memories, but also candidates to emulate the
behavior of synapses in neuromorphic computing devices. It is nowadays well
established that the motion of oxygen vacancies (OV) at the nanoscale is the
key mechanism to reversibly switch metal/insulator/metal structures from
insulating to conducting, i.e. to accomplish the resistive switching effect.
The control of OV dynamics has a direct effect on the resistance changes, and
therefore on different figures of memristive devices, such as switching speed,
retention, endurance or energy consumption. Advances in this direction demand
not only experimental techniques that allow for measurements of OV dynamics,
but also of theoretical studies that shed light on the involved mechanisms.
Along this goal, we analize the OV dynamics in redox interfaces formed when an
oxidizable metallic electrode is in contact with the insulating oxide. We show
how the transfer of OV can be manipulated by using different electrical stimuli
protocols to optimize device figures such as the ON/OFF ratio or the energy
dissipation linked to the writing process. Analytical expressions for attained
resistance values, including the high and low resistance states are derived in
terms of total transferred OV in a nanoscale region of the interface. Our
predictions are validated with experiments performed in

analysis of nonlinear compartmental systems. The application of this theory to
the ecosystem analysis has also been introduced in a separate article. Based on
this methodology, multiple new dynamic ecological system measures and indices
of matrix, vector, and scalar types are systematically introduced in the
present paper. These mathematical system analysis tools are quantitative
ecological indicators that monitor the flow distribution and storage
organization, quantify the direct, indirect, acyclic, cycling, and transfer
(diact) effects and utilities of one compartment on another, identify the
system efficiencies and stress, measure the compartmental exposures to system
flows, determine the residence times and compartmental activity levels, and
ascertain the system resilience and resistance in the case of disturbances. The
proposed dynamic system measures and indices, thus, extract detailed
information about ecosystems' characteristics, as well as their functions,
properties, behaviors, and various other system attributes that are potentially
hidden in and even obscured by data. A dynamic technique for the quantitative
characterization and classification of main interspecific interactions and the
determination of their strength within food webs is also developed based on the
diact effect and utility indices. Moreover, major concepts and quantities in
the current static network analyses are also extended to nonlinear dynamic
settings and integrated with the proposed dynamic measures and indices in this
unifying mathematical framework. We consider that the proposed methodology
brings a novel complex system theory to the service of urgent and challenging
environmental problems of the day and has the potential to lead the way to a
more formalistic ecological science.

adaptive, open-ended cultural evolution came about through two
temporally-distinct cognitive transitions. First, the origin of Homo-specific
culture over two MYA was made possible by the onset of a finer-grained
associative memory that allowed episodes to be encoded in greater detail. This
in turn meant more overlap amongst the distributed representations of these
episodes, such that they could more readily evoke one another through
self-triggered recall (STR). STR enabled representational redescription, the
chaining of thoughts and actions, and the capacity for a stream of thought.
Second, fully cognitive modernity following the appearance of anatomical
modernity after 200,000 BP, was made possible by the onset of contextual focus
(CF): the ability to shift between an explicit convergent mode conducive to
logic and refinement of ideas, and an implicit divergent mode conducive to
free-association, viewing situations from radically new perspectives, concept
combination, analogical thinking, and insight. This paved the way for an
integrated, creative internal network of understandings, and behavioral
modernity. We discuss feasible neural mechanisms for this two-stage proposal,
and outline how STR and CF differ from other proposals. We provide
computational evidence for the proposal obtained with an agent-based model of
cultural evolution in which agents invent ideas for actions and imitate the
fittest of their neighbors' actions. Mean fitness and diversity of actions
across the artificial society increased with STR, and even more so with CF, but
CF was only effective if STR was already in place. CF was most effective
following a change in task, which supports its hypothesized role in escaping
mental fixation. The proposal is discussed in the context of transition theory
in the life sciences.

the case of univariate data analysis we discuss stochastic processes with
auto-correlated increments and univariate distributions derived from specific
stochastic processes, i.e. Levy and Tsallis distributions. Deep investigation
of multivariate non-Gaussian distributions requires the copula approach. A
copula is an component of multivariate distribution that models the mutual
interdependence between marginals. There are many copula families characterised
by various measures of the dependence between marginals. Importantly, one of
those are `tail' dependencies that model the simultaneous appearance of extreme
values in many marginals. Those extreme events may reflect a crisis given
financial data, outliers in machine learning, or a traffic congestion. Next we
discuss higher order multivariate cumulants that are non-zero if multivariate
distribution is non-Gaussian. However, the relation between cumulants and
copulas is not straight forward and rather complicated. We discuss the
application of those cumulants to extract information about non-Gaussian
multivariate distributions, such that information about non-Gaussian copulas.
The use of higher order multivariate cumulants in computer science is inspired
by financial data analysis, especially by the safe investment portfolio
evaluation. There are many other applications of higher order multivariate
cumulants in data engineering, especially in: signal processing, non-linear
system identification, blind sources separation, and direction finding
algorithms of multi-source signals.

probing single vacancies in black phosphorus, we present a theory for Fano
antiresonances induced by coupling between vacancy states and edge states of
zigzag phosphorene nanoribbons (zPNRs). To this end, in the first step, using
the tight-binding Hamiltonian, we obtain an analytic solution on the lattice
for the state associated to a single vacancy located in the bulk phosphorene
which shows a highly anisotropic localization in real space. For a finite
zigzag ribbon, in the absence of particle-hole symmetry, the localized state
induced by vacancies can couple to the wave functions of the edge states which
results in the formation of a new bound state. The energy of vacancy bound
state lies inside the quasi-flat band composed of edge states when the vacancy
locates sufficiently far away from the edge. Then, we employ the T-matrix
Lippmann-Schwinger approach to obtain an explicit analytical expression for the
scattering amplitude of the edge electrons of a zPNR by the presence of a
single vacancy which shows a Fano resonance profile with a tunable dip. We
demonstrate that varying the position of the vacancy produces substantially
different effects on the resonance width, resonance energy position, and the
asymmetry parameter of Fano line shape. Furthermore, the validity of the
theoretical descriptions is verified numerically by using the Landauer
approach.

  Illiquid Corporate Bonds","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1806.01731",,,,"q-fin.ST cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies an application of machine learning in extracting features
from the historical market implied corporate bond yields. We consider an
example of a hypothetical illiquid fixed income market. After choosing a
surrogate liquid market, we apply the Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) algorithm to
learn the features of the missing yield parameters from the historical data of
the instruments traded in the chosen liquid market. The DAE algorithm is then
challenged by two ""point-in-time"" inpainting algorithms taken from the image
processing and computer vision domain. It is observed that, when tested on
unobserved rate surfaces, the DAE algorithm exhibits superior performance
thanks to the features it has learned from the historical shapes of yield
curves.

rotational Kantowski-Sachs spacetime. We choose a suitable change of variable
so that the Field equations modified to an autonomous system. Then we finds the
critical points and inspect the stability of them. Finally, the flow on the
Poincar{\'{e}} sphere is shown and consequently the behavior at infinity is
determined. To analyze the non-hyperbolic critical points Center Manifold
Theory has been used. Possible bifurcation scenarios also have been explained.

  framework","16 pages, no figures","Physica A Vol 517 (2019) 0-7","10.1016/j.physa.2018.10.056",,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Verlinde has recently conjectured, via a Beckenstein-like thought experiment,
that gravitation, instead of being an elementary force, is an emergent entropic
one. This rather surprising conjecture was actually proved in [Physica A {\bf
505} (2018) 190], in a strictly classical statistical mechanics' environment.
In this Communication, we work in a quantum statistical context to consider the
conjecture in the case of bosons/fermions, in a Tsallis' framework. We prove
that Tsallis' entropy is the operating potential energy in this quantum
treatment, something that does not happen in the case of Boltzmann-Gibbs'
entropy. \color{red} In the classical limit, we show that the emergent force
has a Newtonian dependence with the distance.
