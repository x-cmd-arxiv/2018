where the sensing matrix is not precisely known. Such cases exist when there
are imperfections or unknown calibration parameters during the measurement
process. Particularly, the sensing matrix may have some structure, which makes
the perturbation follow a fixed pattern. While previous work has focused on
extending the approximate message passing (AMP) and LASSO algorithm to deal
with the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) perturbation, we
propose the robust variant vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm
with the perturbation being structured, based on the recent VAMP algorithm. The
performance of the robust version of VAMP is demonstrated numerically.

at $t$ different from 0. Our extended FMO approach gives an excellent
description of the 3266 experimental points considered in a wide range of
energies and momentum transferred. We show that the very interesting TOTEM
results for proton-proton differential cross-section in the range 2.76-13 TeV,
together with the Tevatron data for antiproton-proton at 1.8 and 1.96 TeV give
further experimental evidence for the existence of the Odderon. One spectacular
theoretical result is the fact that the difference in the dip-bump region
between $\bar pp$ and $pp$ differential cross-sections is diminishing with
increasing energies and for very high energies (say 100 TeV), the difference
between $\bar pp$ and $pp$ in the dip-bump region is changing its sign: $pp$
becomes bigger than $\bar pp$ at $|t|$ about 1 GeV$^2$. This is a typical
Odderon effect. Another important - phenomenological - result of our approach
is that the slope in $pp$ scattering has different behavior in $t$ than the
slope in $\bar pp$ scattering. This is also a clear Odderon effect.

The objective is to derive the optimal error estimates and to prove the
zero-level sets of the Cahn-Hilliard equation approximate the Hele-Shaw flow.
If the piecewise $L^{\infty}(H^2)$ error bound is derived by choosing test
function directly, we cannot obtain the optimal error order, and we cannot
establish the error bound which depends on $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ polynomially
either. To overcome this difficulty, this paper proves them by the following
steps, and the result in each next step cannot be established without using the
result in its previous one. First, it proves some a priori estimates of the
exact solution $u$, and these regularity results are minimal to get the main
results; Second, it establishes ${L^{\infty}(L^2)}$ and piecewise ${L^2(H^2)}$
error bounds which depend on $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ polynomially based on the
piecewise ${L^{\infty}(H^{-1})}$ and ${L^2(H^1)}$ error bounds; Third, it
establishes piecewise ${L^{\infty}(H^2)}$ optimal error bound which depends on
$\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ polynomially based on the piecewise ${L^{\infty}(L^2)}$
and ${L^2(H^2)}$ error bounds; Finally, it proves the ${L^\infty(L^\infty)}$
error bound and the approximation to the Hele-Shaw flow based on the piecewise
${L^{\infty}(H^2)}$ error bound. The nonstandard techniques are used in these
steps such as the generalized coercivity result, integration by part in space,
summation by part in time, and special properties of the Morley elements. If
one of these techniques is lacked, either we can only obtain the sub-optimal
piecewise ${L^{\infty}(H^2)}$ error order, or we can merely obtain the error
bounds which are exponentially dependent on $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$. Numerical
results are presented to validate the optimal $L^\infty(H^2)$ error order and
the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the Cahn-Hilliard equation.

by examining the relation between information flows in measurements and the
ability of observers to reverse evolutions. I show that in the Newtonian
dynamics reversibility is unaffected by the observer's retention of the
information about the measurement outcome. By contrast -- even though quantum
dynamics is unitary, hence, reversible -- reversing quantum evolution that led
to a measurement becomes in principle impossible for an observer who keeps the
record of its outcome. Thus, quantum irreversibility can result from the
information gain rather than just its loss -- rather than just an increase of
the (von Neumann) entropy. Recording of the outcome of the measurement resets,
in effect, initial conditions within the observer's (branch of) the Universe.
Nevertheless, I also show that observer's friend -- an agent who knows what
measurement was successfully carried out and can confirm that the observer
knows the outcome but resists his curiosity and does not find out the result --
can, in principle, undo the measurement. This relativity of quantum
reversibility sheds new light on the origin of the arrow of time and elucidates
the role of information in classical and quantum physics. Quantum discord
appears as a natural measure of the extent to which dissemination of
information about the outcome affects the ability to reverse the measurement.

training. Our work demonstrates the suprising effectiveness of
carefully-rendered synthetic data for the intrinsic images task.

their response to light polarized perpendicular to the nanotube axis has not
been well explored. Here, by using a macroscopic film of highly aligned
single-chirality (6,5) SWCNTs, we performed a systematic polarization-dependent
optical absorption spectroscopy study. In addition to the commonly observed
angular-momentum-conserving interband absorption of parallel-polarized light,
which generates $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ excitons, we observed a small but
unambiguous absorption peak whose intensity is maximum for
perpendicular-polarized light. We attribute this feature to the lowest-energy
cross-polarized interband absorption processes that change the angular momentum
along the nanotube axis by $\pm 1$, generating $E_{12}$ and $E_{21}$ excitons.
The energy difference between the $E_{12}$ and $E_{21}$ exciton peaks, expected
from asymmetry between the conduction and valence bands, was smaller than the
observed linewidth. Unlike previous observations of cross-polarized excitons in
polarization-dependent photoluminescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy
experiments, our direct observation using absorption spectroscopy allowed us to
quantitatively analyze this resonance. Specifically, we determined the energy
and oscillator strength of this resonance to be 1.54 and 0.05, respectively,
compared with the values for the $E_{11}$ exciton peak. These values, in
combination with comparison with theoretical calculations, in turn led to an
assessment of the environmental effect on the strength of Coulomb interactions

challenging set of scenes. They can potentially exploit an enormous amount of
training data collected from vehicles in the field, but the volumes are too
large to train offline naively. Not all training instances are equally valuable
though, and importance sampling can be used to prioritize which training images
to collect. This approach assumes that objects in images are labeled with high
accuracy. To generate accurate labels in the field, we exploit the
spatio-temporal coherence of vehicle video. We use a near-to-far labeling
strategy by first labeling large, close objects in the video, and tracking them
back in time to induce labels on small distant presentations of those objects.
In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in several steps.
First, we note that an optimal subset (relative to all the objects encountered
and labeled) of labeled objects in images can be obtained by importance
sampling using gradients of the recognition network. Next we show that these
gradients can be approximated with very low error using the loss function,
which is already available when the CNN is running inference. Then, we
generalize these results to objects in a larger scene using an object detection
system. Finally, we describe a self-labeling scheme using object tracking.
Objects are tracked back in time (near-to-far) and labels of near objects are
used to check accuracy of those objects in the far field. We then evaluate the
accuracy of models trained on importance sampled data vs models trained on
complete data.

approach for computing delay Lyapunov matrices and H2 norms for systems with
multiple discrete delays, whose applicability extends towards problems where
the matrices are large and sparse, and the associated positive semidefinite

spectral discretization of the system of delay equations, ii) a targeted
similarity transformation which induces a desired structure and sparsity
pattern and, at the same time, favors accurate low rank solutions of the
corresponding Lyapunov equation, and iii) a Krylov method for large-scale

that increasing absorption significantly suppresses the interference structure

image by using the color line model to assess the commitment of airlight in
each patch of the image and interpolate at the local neighborhood where the
estimate is unreliable. The NN based regularization of the DCP can remove the
haze, whereas, the color line based interpolation of airlight effect makes the
proposed system robust against the variation of haze within an image due to
multiple light sources. The proposed method is tested on benchmark datasets and

processing for the graphics processing units (GPUs) in the car. This directly
translates into battery drain and lower energy efficiency, crucial factors in
electric vehicles. This is due to the high bit rate of the captured video and
other sensing inputs, mainly due to Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor
at the top of the car which is an essential feature in autonomous vehicles.
LiDAR is needed to obtain a high precision map for the vehicle AI to make
relevant decisions. However, this is still a quite restricted view from the
car. This is the same even in the case of cars without a LiDAR such as Tesla.
The existing LiDARs and the cameras have limited horizontal and vertical fields
of visions. In all cases it can be argued that precision is lower, given the
smaller map generated. This also results in the accumulation of a large amount
of data in the order of several TBs in a day, the storage of which becomes
challenging. If we are to reduce the effort for the processing units inside the
car, we need to uplink the data to edge or an appropriately placed cloud.
However, the required data rates in the order of several Gbps are difficult to
be met even with the advent of 5G. Therefore, we propose to have a coordinated
set of LiDAR's outside at an elevation which can provide an integrated view
with a much larger field of vision (FoV) to a centralized decision making body

rate in the downlink and with the required latency. The calculations we have

is not just a concept but a feasible system which can be implemented.The

properties of each definition under various worldviews, which are assumptions
about how, if at all, the observed data is biased. We argue that different
worldviews call for different definitions of fairness, and we specify the
worldviews that, when combined with the desire to avoid a criterion for
discrimination that we call disparity amplification, motivate demographic
parity and equalized odds. We also argue that predictive parity and calibration
are insufficient for avoiding disparity amplification because predictive parity
allows an arbitrarily large inter-group disparity and calibration is not robust
to post-processing. Finally, we define a worldview that is more realistic than
the previously considered ones, and we introduce a new notion of fairness that
corresponds to this worldview.

copula model together with stochastic volatility margins. This model
generalizes single factor models relying on the multivariate normal

develop joint Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) within
Gibbs sampling. Thus we avoid information loss caused by the two-step approach
for margins and dependence in copula models as followed by Schamberger et
al(2017). Further, the Bayesian approach allows for high dimensional parameter
spaces as they are present here in addition to uncertainty quantification
through credible intervals. By allowing for indicators for different copula
families the copula families are selected automatically in the Bayesian
framework. In a first simulation study the performance of HMC is compared to
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach developed by Schamberger et
al(2017) for the copula part. It is shown that HMC considerably outperforms
this approach in terms of effective sample size, MSE and observed coverage
probabilities. In a second simulation study satisfactory performance is seen
for the full HMC within Gibbs procedure. The approach is illustrated for a
portfolio of financial assets with respect to one-day ahead value at risk
forecasts. We provide comparison to a two-step estimation procedure of the
proposed model and to relevant benchmark models: a model with dynamic linear
models for the margins and a single factor copula for the dependence proposed
by Schamberger et al(2017) and a multivariate factor stochastic volatility

the past decade of network embedding approaches either explicitly factorize a

the resultant single low-rank embedding matrix is insufficient to capture all
the observed connectivity patterns. In this regard, we propose a novel
multi-level network embedding framework BoostNE, which can learn multiple
network embedding representations of different granularity from coarse to fine

providing broader signal coverage and more extensive surveillance capabilities
in military and civilian applications. Due to the broadcast nature of the
wireless signal and the openness of the space, UAV eavesdroppers (UEDs) pose a
potential threat to ground communications. In this paper, we consider the
communications of a legitimate ground link in the presence of friendly jamming
and UEDs within a finite area of space. The spatial distribution of the UEDs
obeying a uniform binomial point process (BPP) is used to characterize the
randomness of the UEDs. The ground link is assumed to experience log-distance
path loss and Rayleigh fading, while free space path loss with/without the
averaged excess path loss due to the environment is used for the
air-to-ground/air-to-air links. A piecewise function is proposed to approximate
the line-of-sight (LoS) probability for the air-to-ground links, which provides
a better approximation than using the existing sigmoid-based fitting. The
analytical expression for the secure connection probability (SCP) of the
legitimate ground link in the presence of non-colluding UEDs is derived. The
analysis reveals some useful trends in the SCP as a function of the transmit
signal to jamming power ratio, the location of the UAV jammer, and the height

that lead to mass degeneracies among some of the physical scalars. In Higgs
sectors with two scalar doublets, the exact degeneracy of scalar masses,
without an artificial fine-tuning of the scalar potential parameters, is
possible only in the case of the inert doublet model (IDM), where the scalar
potential respects a global U(1) symmetry that is not broken by the vacuum. In
the case of three doublets, we introduce and analyze the replicated inert
doublet model, which possesses two inert doublets of scalars. We then
generalize this model to obtain a scalar potential, first proposed by Ivanov
and Silva, with a CP4 symmetry that guarantees the existence of pairwise
degenerate scalar states among two pairs of neutral scalars and two pairs of
charged scalars. Here, CP4 is a generalized CP symmetry with the property that
$({\rm CP}4)^n$ is the identity operator only for integer $n$ values that are
multiples of 4. The form of the CP4-symmetric scalar potential is simplest when
expressed in the Higgs basis, where the neutral scalar field vacuum expectation
value resides entirely in one of the scalar doublet fields. The symmetries of
the model permit a term in the scalar potential with a complex coefficient that
cannot be removed by any redefinition of the scalar fields within the class of
Higgs bases (in which case, we say that no real Higgs basis exists). A striking
feature of the CP4-symmetric model is that it preserves CP even in the absence
of a real Higgs basis, as illustrated by the cancellation of the contributions
to the CP violating form factors of the effective ZZZ and ZWW vertices.

for Nambu-Goto strings using a fully covariant formalism. We work with
equations of motion expressed in terms of a higher dimensional analog of the
geodesic equation subject to self-generated forcing terms. The approach allows
arbitrary spacetime and worldsheet gauge choices for the background and
perturbation.
  The perturbed spacetime metric may be expressed as an integral over a
distributional stress-energy tensor supported on the string worldsheet. By
formally integrating out the distribution, this quantity may be re-expressed in
terms of an integral over the retarded image of the string. In doing so, one
must pay particular attention to contributions that arise from the field point
and from non-smooth regions of the string. Then, the gradient of the perturbed
metric decomposes into a sum of boundary and bulk terms. The decomposition
depends upon the worldsheet coordinates used to describe the string, but the
total is independent of those considerations.
  We illustrate the method with numerical calculations of the self-force at
every point on the worldsheet for loops with kinks, cusps and
self-intersections using a variety of different coordinate choices. For field
points on smooth parts of the worldsheet the self-force is finite. As the field
point approaches a kink or cusp the self-force diverges, but is integrable in
the sense that the displacement of the worldsheet remains finite. As a
consistency check, we verify that the period-averaged flux of energy-momentum
at infinity matches the direct work the self-force performs on the string.
  The methodology can be applied to address many fundamental questions for
string loop evolution.

developed to represent exact many-body ground state wavefunctions for special
high magnetizations. Using this map we show that these exact ground state

equivalence of the ground-state wavefunction of the Ising, Heisenberg and $XY$

up to a critical interaction strength. For the case of zero magnetization,
where the ground state is not exactly known, we perform density matrix
renormalization group calculations. Based on the calculation of the ground

agents are equally able to manipulate their features in an attempt to ""trick"" a

agent's ability to adapt to an algorithm is not simply a function of her
personal interest in receiving a positive classification, but is bound up in a
complex web of social factors that affect her ability to pursue certain action
responses. In this paper, we adapt models of strategic manipulation to capture
dynamics that may arise in a setting of social inequality wherein candidate
groups face different costs to manipulation. We find that whenever one group's
costs are higher than the other's, the learner's equilibrium strategy exhibits
an inequality-reinforcing phenomenon wherein the learner erroneously admits
some members of the advantaged group, while erroneously excluding some members
of the disadvantaged group. We also consider the effects of interventions in

a paradoxical result: there exist cases in which providing a subsidy improves

  Presence of Hybridization",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Phylogenetic networks extend phylogenetic trees to allow for modeling
reticulate evolutionary processes such as hybridization. They take the shape of
a rooted, directed, acyclic graph, and when parameterized with evolutionary
parameters, such as divergence times and population sizes, they form a
generative process of molecular sequence evolution. Early work on computational
methods for phylogenetic network inference focused exclusively on reticulations
and sought networks with the fewest number of reticulations to fit the data. As
processes such as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) could be at play
concurrently with hybridization, work in the last decade has shifted to
computational approaches for phylogenetic network inference in the presence of
ILS. In such a short period, significant advances have been made on developing
and implementing such computational approaches. In particular, parsimony,
likelihood, and Bayesian methods have been devised for estimating phylogenetic
networks and associated parameters using estimated gene trees as data. Use of
those inference methods has been augmented with statistical tests for specific
hypotheses of hybridization, like the D-statistic. Most recently, Bayesian
approaches for inferring phylogenetic networks directly from sequence data were
developed and implemented. In this chapter, we survey such advances and discuss
model assumptions as well as methods' strengths and limitations. We also
discuss parallel efforts in the population genetics community aimed at
inferring similar structures. Finally, we highlight major directions for future
research in this area.

multiple access (NOMA) schemes for downlink transmissions. First, we analyze
the benefit of adding intentional timing offsets to the conventional power
domain-NOMA (P-NOMA). This method which is called Asynchronous-Power
Domain-NOMA (AP-NOMA) introduces artificial symbol-offsets between packets
destined for different users. It reduces the mutual interference which results
in enlarging the achievable rate-region of the conventional P-NOMA. Then, we
propose a precoding scheme which fully exploits the degrees of freedom provided
by the time asynchrony. We call this multiple access scheme T-NOMA which
provides higher degrees of freedom for users compared to the conventional
P-NOMA or even the modified AP-NOMA. T-NOMA adopts a precoding at the base
station and a linear preprocessing scheme at the receiving user which
decomposes the broadcast channel into parallel channels circumventing the need
for Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC). The numerical results show that
T-NOMA outperforms AP-NOMA and both outperform the conventional P-NOMA. We also
compare the maximum sum-rate and fairness provided by these methods. Moreover,
the impact of pulse shape and symbol offset on the performance of AP-NOMA and
T-NOMA schemes are investigated.

chain on a horizontal table. One end is anchored to a wall, the other (free)
end is pulled by external force. A Green's function is derived to calculate the
response to a generic pulling force. As an example, I assume that the magnitude
of the pulling force increases with time at a uniform rate $\beta$. If the
number of beads and springs used to model the chain is large, the extension of
each spring takes a simple closed form, which is a piecewise-linear function of
time. Under an additional assumption that a spring breaks when its extension
exceeds a certain threshold, results show that for large $\beta$ the spring
breaks near the pulling end, whereas the breaking point can be located close to
the wall by choosing small $\beta$. More precisely, the breaking point moves
back and forth along the chain as $\beta$ decreases, which has been called
""anomalous"" breaking in the context of the pull-or-jerk experiment. Although
the experiment has been explained in terms of inertia, its meaning can be fully
captured by discussing the competition between intrinsic and extrinsic time
scales of forced oscillation.

characters and dictionary features are first projected into dense vector
representations, then they are fed into the residual dilated convolutional
neural network to capture contextual features. Finally, a conditional random
field is employed to capture dependencies between neighboring tags.

few percents, is a necessary consequence of the polycrystalline nature of the
materials. The polycrystal undergoing plastic deformation is modeled as a
flowing continuum of random deformable polyhedra, representing the grains,
which fill the space without leaving voids. Adjacent grains slide with a
relative velocity proportional to the local shear stress resolved on the plane
of the shared grain boundary, when greater than a finite threshold. The
polyhedral grains reshape continuously to preserve matter continuity, being the
forces causing grain sliding dominant over those reshaping the grains. It has
been shown in the past that this model does not conserve volume, causing a
monotonic hydrostatic pressure variation with strain. This effect introduces a
novel concept in the theory of plasticity because determines that any fine
grained polycrystalline material will fail after a finite plastic strain. Here
the hydrostatic pressure dependence on strain is explicitly calculated and
shown that has a logarithmic divergence which determines the strain to
fracture. Comparison of theoretical results with strains to fracture given by
mechanical tests of commercial alloys show very good agreement.

Lett. 122, 061104 (2019)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.061104",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We analyze the impact of a proposed tidal instability coupling $p$-modes and
$g$-modes within neutron stars on GW170817. This non-resonant instability
transfers energy from the orbit of the binary to internal modes of the stars,
accelerating the gravitational-wave driven inspiral. We model the impact of
this instability on the phasing of the gravitational wave signal using three
parameters per star: an overall amplitude, a saturation frequency, and a
spectral index. Incorporating these additional parameters, we compute the Bayes
Factor ($\ln B^{pg}_{!pg}$) comparing our $p$-$g$ model to a standard one. We
find that the observed signal is consistent with waveform models that neglect
$p$-$g$ effects, with $\ln B^{pg}_{!pg} = 0.03^{+0.70}_{-0.58}$ (maximum a
posteriori and 90% credible region). By injecting simulated signals that do not
include $p$-$g$ effects and recovering them with the $p$-$g$ model, we show
that there is a $\simeq 50\%$ probability of obtaining similar $\ln
B^{pg}_{!pg}$ even when $p$-$g$ effects are absent. We find that the $p$-$g$
amplitude for 1.4 $M_\odot$ neutron stars is constrained to $\lesssim
\text{few}\times10^{-7}$, with maxima a posteriori near $\sim 10^{-7}$ and
$p$-$g$ saturation frequency $\sim 70\, \mathrm{Hz}$. This suggests that there
are less than a few hundred excited modes, assuming they all saturate by wave
breaking. For comparison, theoretical upper bounds suggest a $p$-$g$ amplitude
$\lesssim 10^{-6}$ and $\lesssim 10^{3}$ modes saturating by wave breaking.
Thus, the measured constraints only rule out extreme values of the $p$-$g$
parameters. They also imply that the instability dissipates $\lesssim 10^{51}\,
\mathrm{ergs}$ over the entire inspiral, i.e., less than a few percent of the
energy radiated as gravitational waves.

With fully non-perturbative renormalization (and universal normalization on
both quark and gluon), we find that the quark energy and glue field energy
contribute 33(4)(4)\% and 37(5)(4)\% respectively in the $\overline{MS}$ scheme

characteristics of a picosecond laser produced chromium plasma plume upon
double-pulse (DP) irradiation compared to its single-pulse (SP) counterpart. DP
schemes are realized by employing two geometries wherein the inter-pulse delay
($\tau_p$) in the collinear geometry and the spatial separation ($\Delta x$)
are the control parameters for schemes DP$_1$ and DP$_2$ respectively. The
aspect ratio (plume length/plume width) decreases upon increasing parameters
such as pressure, delay between pulses and the energy of the second pulse in
DP1 scheme. Interestingly, the expansion conditions of the plume which occurs
at higher pressures for SP scheme could be recreated in DP1 scheme for a lower
pressure $\sim$ 10$^{-6}$ Torr. This could be potentially applied for immediate
applications such as high harmonic generation and quality thin film production.

change chalcogenides, which can destroy resonances in photonic devices.
Interfaces between Ge2Sb2Te5 and metal layers were studied using X-ray
reflectivity (XRR) and reflectometry of metal-Ge2Sb2Te5 layered stacks. The
diffusion of metal atoms influences the crystallisation temperature and optical
properties of phase change materials. When Au, Ag, Al, W structures are
directly deposited on Ge2Sb2Te5 inter-diffusion occurs. Indeed, Au forms AuTe2
layers at the interface. Diffusion barrier layers, such as Si3N4 or stable
diffusionless plasmonic materials, such as TiN, can prevent the interfacial
damage. This work shows that the interfacial diffusion must be considered when

the presence of interference. This paper proposes regression adjustment
estimators for removing bias due to interference in Bernoulli randomized
experiments. We use a fitted model to predict the counterfactual outcomes of
global control and global treatment. Our work differs from standard regression
adjustments in that the adjustment variables are constructed from functions of
the treatment assignment vector, and that we allow the researcher to use a
collection of any functions correlated with the response, turning the problem
of detecting interference into a feature engineering problem. We characterize
the distribution of the proposed estimator in a linear model setting and
connect the results to the standard theory of regression adjustments under
SUTVA. We then propose an estimator that allows for flexible machine learning
estimators to be used for fitting a nonlinear interference functional form. We
propose conducting statistical inference via bootstrap and resampling methods,
which allow us to sidestep the complicated dependences implied by interference
and instead rely on empirical covariance structures. Such variance estimation
relies on an exogeneity assumption akin to the standard unconfoundedness
assumption invoked in observational studies. In simulation experiments, our
methods are better at debiasing estimates than existing inverse propensity
weighted estimators based on neighborhood exposure modeling. We use our method
to reanalyze an experiment concerning weather insurance adoption conducted on a

  Technology (T-CSVT) 2018",,"10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2866399",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) has been successfully applied to
depth map super-resolution and outperforms existing methods by a wide margin.
However, there still exist two major issues with these DCNN based depth map
super-resolution methods that hinder the performance: i) The low-resolution
depth maps either need to be up-sampled before feeding into the network or
substantial deconvolution has to be used; and ii) The supervision
(high-resolution depth maps) is only applied at the end of the network, thus it
is difficult to handle large up-sampling factors, such as $\times 8, \times
16$. In this paper, we propose a new framework to tackle the above problems.
First, we propose to represent the task of depth map super-resolution as a
series of novel view synthesis sub-tasks. The novel view synthesis sub-task
aims at generating (synthesizing) a depth map from different camera pose, which
could be learned in parallel. Second, to handle large up-sampling factors, we
present a deeply supervised network structure to enforce strong supervision in
each stage of the network. Third, a multi-scale fusion strategy is proposed to
effectively exploit the feature maps at different scales and handle the
blocking effect. In this way, our proposed framework could deal with
challenging depth map super-resolution efficiently under large up-sampling
factors (e.g. $\times 8, \times 16$). Our method only uses the low-resolution
depth map as input, and the support of color image is not needed, which greatly
reduces the restriction of our method. Extensive experiments on various
benchmarking datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over current
state-of-the-art depth map super-resolution methods.

asymmetry is revealed in the frequency domain of the signals under the
condition that an LO phonon mode stays almost energetically resonant with a
plasmon mode in the early time region; this lasts for approximately 100 fs
immediately after the irradiation of an ultrashort pump-laser pulse. It is
understood that based on the adiabatic picture in time, this asymmetry is
caused by the Rosen-Zener coupling between both modes. The associated
experimental results are obtained by measuring time-dependent electro-optic
reflectivity signals, and it is proved that these are in harmony with the
calculated ones. The spectra become more symmetric, as the photoexcited carrier
density further changes from that meeting the above condition to higher and
lower sides of carrier densities. Moreover, the effect of optical nutation of

exchange masses get smaller approaching their physical values. Given an
approximate generalized potential the coupled-channel reaction amplitudes are
defined in terms of non-linear systems of integral equations. For large
exchange masses, where there are no anomalous thresholds present, conventional
$N/D$ methods are applicable to derive numerical solutions to the latter. At a
formal level a generalization to the anomalous case is readily formulated by
use of suitable contour integrations with amplitudes to be evaluated at complex
energies. However, it is a considerable challenge to find numerical solutions
to anomalous systems set up on a set of complex contours. By a suitable
deformations of left-hand and right-hand cut lines we managed to establish a

will be determined largely by integrated CO2 emissions over time rather than
the precise timing of the emissions, with a relation of near-proportionality
between global warming and cumulative CO2 emissions. This paper examines
optimal abatement pathways under an exogenous constraint on cumulative
emissions. Least cost abatement pathways have carbon tax rising at the
risk-free interest rate, but if endogenous learning or climate damage costs are
included in the analysis, the carbon tax grows more slowly. The inclusion of
damage costs in the optimization leads to a higher initial carbon tax, whereas
the effect of learning depends on whether it appears as an additive or
multiplicative contribution to the marginal cost curve. Multiplicative models
are common in the literature and lead to delayed abatement and a smaller
initial tax. The required initial carbon tax increases with the cumulative
abatement goal and is higher for lower interest rates. Delaying the start of
abatement is costly owing to the increasing marginal abatement cost. Lower
interest rates lead to higher relative costs of delaying abatement because
these induce higher abatement rates early on. The fraction of business-as-usual
emissions (BAU) avoided in optimal pathways increases for low interest rates
and rapid growth of the abatement cost curve, which allows a lower threshold
global warming goal to become attainable without overshoot in temperature. Each
year of delay in starting abatement raises this threshold by an increasing
amount, because the abatement rate increases exponentially with time.

discontinuity at the transition temperature for $\mu < \mu_c$ where first-order

particular, it is shown how the quantum annealing process is able to find
global optima even in the case of problems that do not directly involve binary
variables. The problem addressed in this work is the following: taking a matrix
V, find two matrices W and H such that the norm between V and the matrix
product WH is as small as possible. The work is inspired by O'Malley's article
[1], where the author proposed an algorithm to solve a problem very similar to
ours, where however the matrix H was formed by only binary variables. In our
case neither of the two matrices W or H is a binary matrix. In particular, the
factorization foresees that the matrix W is composed of real numbers between 0

with this type of factorization generates a potential composed of many local
minima. We show that simple forward-annealing techniques are not sufficient to
solve the problem. The new D-Wave 2000Q has introduced new solution refinement
techniques, including reverse-annealing. Reverse-annealing allows to explore
the configuration space starting from a point chosen by the user, for example a
local minimum obtained with a precedent forward-annealing. In this article we
propose an algorithm based on the reverse annealing technique (that we called

positive solution in subcritical case $2<q<\frac{2n}{n+\alpha}$, and
nonexistence of energy maximizing positive solution in critical case
$q=\frac{2n}{n+\alpha}$ are proved in \cite{DZ2017}. For $\alpha>n$, the
existence of energy minimizing positive solution in subcritical case
$0<q<\frac{2n}{n+\alpha}$, and nonexistence of energy minimizing positive

maximizing positive solution as $q\to (\frac{2n}{n+\alpha})^+ $ (in the case of
$1<\alpha<n$), and the blowup behaviour of energy minimizing positive solution
as $q\to (\frac{2n}{n+\alpha})^-$ (in the case of $\alpha>n$) are analyzed. We
see that for $1<\alpha<n$ the blowup behaviour obtained is quite similar to
that of the elliptic equation involving subcritical Sobolev exponent. But for

core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are structured. Rather than being smooth and
homogeneous, the material is made of over-dense and under-dense regions of
distinct composition. Here, we explore the effect of clumping on the SN
radiation during the photospheric phase using 1-D non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium radiative transfer and an ejecta model arising from a
blue-supergiant explosion (yielding a Type II-peculiar SN). Neglecting chemical
segregation, we adopt a velocity-dependent volume-filling factor approach that
assumes that the clumps are small but does not change the column density along
any sightline. We find that clumping boosts the recombination rate in the
photospheric layers, leading to a faster recession of the photosphere, an
increase in bolometric luminosity, and a reddening of the SN colors through
enhanced blanketing. The SN bolometric light curve peaks earlier and
transitions faster to the nebular phase. On the rise to maximum, the strongest
luminosity contrast between our clumped and smooth models is obtained at the
epoch when the photosphere has receded to ejecta layers where the clumping
factor is only 0.5 -- this clumping factor may be larger in Nature. Clumping is
seen to have a similar influence in a Type II-Plateau SN model. As we neglect
both porosity and chemical segregation our models underestimate the true impact
of clumping. These results warrant further study of the influence of clumping
on the observables of other SN types during the photospheric phase.

occurrence of a type II X-ray outburst. We find significant changes in
polarization degree and polarization angle and highly distorted line profiles
during the 2017 X-ray outburst. The degree of polarization decreased by $\sim$
1%, while the polarization angle, which is supposed to be related with the disk
orientation, first increased by $\sim 10^{\circ}$ in about two months and then
decreased by a similar amount and on a similar timescale once the X-ray
activity ceased.We interpret the polarimetric and spectroscopic variability as
evidence for the presence of a warped disk.

that cannot be reproduced by current angular momentum evolution model. In this
work, we study the parameter space of star-planet system's configurations to
investigate if including the tidal star-planet interaction in angular momentum
evolution models could reproduce these rotation period distribution's
anomalies. To study this effect, we use a parametric angular momentum evolution
model that allows for core-envelope decoupling and angular momentum extraction
by magnetized stellar wind that we coupled to an orbital evolution code where
we take into account the torque due to the tides raised on the star by the
planet. We explore different stellar and planetary configurations (stellar mass
from 0.5 to 1.0 $\rm M_{\odot}$ and planetary mass from 10 $\rm M_{\oplus}$ to
13 $\rm M_{\rm jup}$) to study their effect on the planetary orbital and
stellar rotational evolution. The stellar angular momentum is the most impacted
by the star-planet interaction when the planet is engulfed during the early
main sequence phase. Thus, if a close-in Jupiter mass planet is initially
located around 50\% of the stellar corotation radius, a kink in the rotational
period distribution opens around late and early K-type stars during the early
main sequence phase. Tidal star-planet interactions can create a kink in the
rotation period distribution of low-mass stars, which could possibly account
for unexpected scatter seen in the rotational period distribution of young
stellar clusters.

magnetohydrodynamics equations into the adaptive-mesh-refinement code RAMSES to
study its impact on star formation. Recent works show that the Hall effect
heavily influences the regulation of the angular momentum in collapsing dense
cores, strengthening or weakening the magnetic braking. Our method consists of
a modification of the two-dimensional constrained transport scheme. Our scheme
shows convergence of second-order in space and the frequency of the propagation
of whistler waves is accurate. We confirm previous results, namely that during
the collapse, the Hall effect generates a rotation of the fluid with a
direction in the mid-plane that depends on the sign of the Hall resistivity,
while counter-rotating envelopes develop on each side of the mid-plane.
However, we find that the predictability of our numerical results is severely
limited. The angular momentum is not conserved in any of our dense
core-collapse simulations with the Hall effect: a large amount of angular
momentum is generated within the first Larson core, a few hundred years after
its formation, without compensation by the surrounding gas. This issue is not
mentioned in previous studies and may be correlated to the formation of the
accretion shock on the Larson core. We expect that this numerical effect could
be a serious issue in star formation simulations.

used in the calculation of the axial form factors of the nucleon are studied in
chiral perturbation theory. For physically small quark masses the nucleon-pion
states are expected to dominante the excited-state contamination at large
euclidean time separations. To leading order in chiral perturbation theory the
results depend on two experimentally well-known low-energy constants only and
the nucleon-pion-state contribution can be reliably estimated. The
nucleon-pion-state contribution to the axial form factor $G_{\rm A}(Q^2)$ is at
the 5 percent level for source-sink separations of 2 fm and shows almost no
dependence on the momentum transfer $Q^2$. In contrast, for the induced pseudo
scalar form factor $G_{\rm P}(Q^2)$ the nucleon-pion-state contribution shows a
rather strong dependence on $Q^2$ and leads to a 10 to 40 percent
underestimation of $G_{\rm P}(Q^2)$ at small momentum transfers. Applying the
ChPT results to recent lattice data generated by the PACS collaboration we find
agreement with experimental data and the predictions of the pion-pole dominance

present a possible explanation of this vanishing velocity bias. The starting
point is that, halos are peaks in the low redshift {\it non-Gaussian} density
field with smoothing scale $R_{\Delta}$ (virial radius), instead of peaks in
the high redshift initial {\it Gaussian} density field with a factor of
$\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{1/3})$ larger smoothing scale. Based on the approximation
that the density field can be Gaussianized by a local and monotonic
transformation, we extend the peak model to the non-Gaussian density field and
derive the analytical expression of velocity dispersion and velocity power

indeed much weaker than the previous prediction, and the agreement with the

difference of attractiveness among cities. This flow structure can be
approximately described by the gravity model of spatial economics. Besides, the
value of scaling exponent of distance function in the gravity model is less

for the masses. How do we make it less painful? This article addresses one of
the obstacles: the need to specify explicit ""frame clauses"", expressing what
properties are left unchanged by an operation. It is fair enough to ask the
would-be (human) prover to state what each operation changes, and how, but the
(mechanical) prover also requires knowledge of what it does not change. The
process of specifying and verifying these properties is tedious and
error-prone, and must be repeated whenever the software evolves. it is also
hard to justify, since all the information about what the code changes is in
the code itself.
  The AutoFrame tool presented here performs this analysis entirely
automatically. It applies to object-oriented programming, where the issue is
compounded by aliasing: if x is aliased to y, any update to x.a also affects
y.a, even though the updating instruction usually does not even mention y. This
aspect turns out to be the most delicate, and is addressed in AutoFrame by
taking advantage of a companion tool, AutoAlias, which performs sound and
sufficiently precise alias analysis, also in an entirely automatic way.
  Some practical results of AutoFrame so far are: (1) the automatic
reconstruction (in about 25 seconds on an ordinary laptop) of the exact frame
clauses, a total of 169 clauses, for an 8,000-line data structures and
algorithms library which was previously (with the manually written frame
clauses) verified for functional correctness using a mechanical program prover;
and (2) the automatic generation (in less than 4 minutes) of frame conditions
for a 150,000-line graphical and GUI library. The source code of AutoFrame and

Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The observations probe scales of 60 AU
where most of the organic molecules have sublimated off dust grains and are
present in the gas-phase. The complex organic molecules can be divided into two
groups with one group, the simpler species, showing a D/H ratio of
approximately 2% and the other, the more complex species, D/H ratios of 4-8%.
This division may reflect the formation time of each species in the ices before
or during warm-up/infall of material through the protostellar envelope. No
significant differences are seen in the deuteration of different functional
groups for individual species, possibly a result of the short time-scale for
infall through the innermost warm regions where exchange reactions between
different species may be taking place. The species show differences in
excitation temperatures between 125 K and 300 K. This likely reflects the
binding energies/sublimation temperatures of the individual species, in good
agreement to what has previously been found for high-mass sources. For dimethyl
ether, the 12C/13C ratio is found to be lower by up to a factor of 2 compared
to typical ISM values similar to what has previously been inferred for
glycolaldehyde. The results point to the importance of ice surface chemistry

remain elusive. In this paper, we provide an attempt to answer: ""what exactly
makes natural scene memorable"". Specifically, we first build LNSIM, a
large-scale natural scene image memorability database (containing 2,632 images
and memorability annotations). Then, we mine our database to investigate how
low-, middle- and high-level handcrafted features affect the memorability of
natural scene. In particular, we find that high-level feature of scene category
is rather correlated with natural scene memorability. Thus, we propose a deep
neural network based natural scene memorability (DeepNSM) predictor, which
takes advantage of scene category. Finally, the experimental results validate
the effectiveness of DeepNSM.

is the following problem: Given an input matrix $M$ and an integer $r$, find a
dictionary $D$ with $r$ columns and a matrix $B$ with $k$-sparse columns (that
is, each column of $B$ has at most $k$ non-zero entries) such that $M \approx
DB$. A key issue in SCA is identifiability, that is, characterizing the
conditions under which $D$ and $B$ are essentially unique (that is, they are
unique up to permutation and scaling of the columns of $D$ and rows of $B$).
Although SCA has been vastly investigated in the last two decades, only a few
works have tackled this issue in the deterministic scenario, and no work
provides reasonable bounds in the minimum number of samples (that is, columns
of $M$) that leads to identifiability. In this work, we provide new results in
the deterministic scenario when the data has a low-rank structure, that is,
when $D$ is (under)complete. While previous bounds feature a combinatorial term
$r \choose k$, we exhibit a sufficient condition involving
$\mathcal{O}(r^3/(r-k)^2)$ samples that yields an essentially unique
decomposition, as long as these data points are well spread among the subspaces
spanned by $r-1$ columns of $D$. We also exhibit a necessary lower bound on the
number of samples that contradicts previous results in the literature when $k$
equals $r-1$. Our bounds provide a drastic improvement compared to the state of
the art, and imply for example that for a fixed proportion of zeros (constant
and independent of $r$, e.g., 10\% of zero entries in $B$), one only requires
$\mathcal{O}(r)$ data points to guarantee identifiability.

placed on the top surface of a three-dimensional thin topological insulator
(TI). For such thin TIs, the top and bottom surfaces interact via a coupling
$\lambda$ which influences the transport properties of junctions constructed
out of them. We find that for junctions hosting a potential barrier, the
differential conductance oscillates with the barrier strength. The period of
these oscillations doubles as the coupling $\lambda$ changes from small values
to a value close to the energy of the incident electrons. In contrast, for
junctions with a magnetic barrier, the conductance approaches a non-zero
constant as the barrier strength is increased. This feature is in contrast to
the case of transport across a single TI surface where the conductance
approaches zero as the strength of a magnetic barrier is increased. We also
study the spin currents for these two kinds of barriers; in both cases, the
spin current is found to have opposite signs on the top and bottom surfaces.
Thus this system can be used to split applied charge currents to spin currents
with opposite spin orientations which can be collected by applying opposite
spin-polarized leads to the two surfaces. We show that several of these
features of transport across finite width barriers can be understood

community to study the dynamics of small inertial particles in fluid flow.
However, most often, the Basset history force in this equation is neglected.
Including the Basset force in numerical solutions of particulate flows involves
storage requirements which rapidly increase in time. Thus the significance of
the Basset history force in the dynamics has not been understood. In this
paper, we show that the Maxey-Riley equation in its entirety can be exactly
mapped as a forced, time-dependent Robin boundary condition of the
one-dimensional heat equation, and solved using the Unified Transform Method.
We obtain the exact solution for a general homogeneous time-dependent flow
field, and apply it to a range of physically relevant situations. In a particle
coming to a halt in a quiescent environment, the Basset history force speeds up
the decay as stretched-exponential at short time while slowing it down to a
power-law relaxation, $\sim t^{-3/2}$, at long time. A particle settling under
gravity is shown to relax even more slowly to its terminal velocity ($\sim
t^{-1/2}$), whereas this relaxation would be expected to take place
exponentially fast if the history term were to be neglected. For a general
flow, our approach makes possible a numerical scheme for arbitrary but smooth
flows without increasing memory demands and with spectral accuracy. We use our
numerical scheme to solve an example spatially varying flow of inertial
particles in the vicinity of a point vortex. We show that the critical radius
for caustics formation shrinks slightly due to history effects. Our scheme
opens up a method for future studies to include the Basset history term in
their calculations to spectral accuracy, without astronomical storage costs.
Moreover our results indicate that the Basset history can affect dynamics
significantly.

fields, which in recent years have found several unique applications. The
existing techniques for generating Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) fields are based
on introducing randomness in a spatially completely coherent field and are
limited in terms of control and precision with which GSM fields can be
generated. In contrast, we demonstrate an experimental technique that is based
on the coherent mode representation of GSM fields. By generating individual
coherent modes and mixing them in proportion fixed by their coherent mode
representation, we experimentally demonstrate generation of several GSM fields.
Since our technique involves only mixing of coherent eigenmodes and does not
involve introducing randomness from outside, it provides much better control
and precision with which GSM fields with a given set of parameter could be
generated.

particles in a DC glow discharge plasma. The characteristics of the dust
dynamics are investigated as a function of the differential gas flow rate, the
background neutral pressure, the dust particle size as well as the neutral
species of the gas. The experiments have been carried out in the table top
Dusty Plasma Experimental (DPEx) device in which a plasma is created between a
disk shaped anode and a grounded cathode in a $\Pi$-shaped pyrex glass tube.
The asymptotic steady state flow velocity of the injected micron sized dust
particles is found to increase with an increase of neutral flow velocity and
decrease with an increase in the background pressure. Furthermore, this
velocity is seen to be independent of the size of the dust particles but
decreases with an increase in the mass of the background gas. A simple
theoretical model, based on estimates of the various forces acting on the dust
particles, is used to elucidate the role of neutrals in the flow dynamics of
the dust particles. Our experiments thus provide a detailed microscopic
understanding of some of the past phenomenological observations of dust flows
in the DPEx device and can prove useful in future experimental implementations
of dust flow experiments.

where the spatial location of a query image is determined by finding out the
most similar reference images in a large database. For solving this problem, a
critical task is to learn discriminative image representation that captures
informative information relevant for localization. We propose a novel
representation learning method having higher location-discriminating power. It
provides the following contributions: 1) we represent a place (location) as a
set of exemplar images depicting the same landmarks and aim to maximize
similarities among intra-place images while minimizing similarities among
inter-place images; 2) we model a similarity measure as a probability
distribution on L_2-metric distances between intra-place and inter-place image
representations; 3) we propose a new Stochastic Attraction and Repulsion
Embedding (SARE) loss function minimizing the KL divergence between the learned
and the actual probability distributions; 4) we give theoretical comparisons
between SARE, triplet ranking and contrastive losses. It provides insights into
why SARE is better by analyzing gradients. Our SARE loss is easy to implement
and pluggable to any CNN. Experiments show that our proposed method improves
the localization performance on standard benchmarks by a large margin.

freedom which consist of dynamical u,d, and s quarks and gluons are captured by
realistic state-of-the art ($m_\pi\approx 161$MeV) lattice QCD simulations of
the HotQCD collaboration. For the heavy quarks we deploy the non-relativistic
effective field theory of QCD, NRQCD. The in-medium properties of quarkonium
are deduced from their spectral functions, which are reconstructed using
improved and novel Bayesian approaches. Through a systematic analysis we shed
light on the origin of the discrepancies in melting temperatures previously
reported in the literature, showing that they are owed to underestimated
methods uncertainties of the deployed spectral reconstructions. Our simulations
corroborate a picture of sequential in-medium modification, ordered according
to the vacuum binding energy of the states. As a central quantitative result,
our study reveals how the mass of the heavy quarkonium ground state reduces as
temperature increases. The observed spectral modifications are interpreted in
the light of, and compared to previous studies based on the complex lattice
potential for heavy quarkonium. Thus for the first time we provide a robust
picture of in-medium heavy quarkonium modification in the quark-gluon plasma
consistent among different non-relativistic methods. We also critically discuss
the perspectives for improving on these results.

melt inclusions carries information about heterogeneity in the mantle. The
difficulty is to disentangle the contributions of source heterogeneity (i.e.,
spatial variability of mantle composition before melting) and process
heterogeneity (i.e., spatial and temporal variability in melt transport). Here
we investigate the end-member hypothesis that variability arises due to source
heterogeneity alone. We model the attenuation of trace-element variability
introduced into the bottom of a one-dimensional, steady-state melting column.
Our results show that the melting column can be considered to be a filter that
attenuates variability according to the wavelength of heterogeneity, the
partition coefficient of the trace element, melt productivity and the
efficiency of melt segregation. We further show that while the model can be fit
to the observations, this requires assumptions inconsistent with constraints on
the timescales of magma assembly. Hence, we falsify the end-member hypothesis
and, instead, conclude that observed variability requires heterogeneity of melt
transport. This might take the form of channels or waves and would almost
certainly interact with source heterogeneity.

mathematics founded by Friedman and developed extensively by Simpson and

of ordinary, i.e. non-set-theoretic, mathematics. As suggested by the title,
this paper deals with the study of the topological notions of dimension and
paracompactness, inside Kohlenbach's higher-order RM. As to splittings, there
are some examples in RM of theorems $A, B, C$ such that
$A\leftrightarrow(B\wedge C)$, i.e. $A$ can be split into two independent
(fairly natural) parts $B$ and $C$, and the aforementioned topological notions
give rise to a number of splittings involving highly natural $A, B, C$.
Nonetheless, the higher-order picture is markedly different from the
second-one: in terms of comprehension axioms, the proof in higher-order RM of
e.g. the paracompactness of the unit interval requires full second-order
arithmetic, while the second-order/countable version of paracompactness of the
unit interval is provable in the base theory of second-order RM. We obtain
similarly 'exceptional' results for the Urysohn identity, the Lindel\""of lemma,

in that they do not depend on the exact definition of cover, even in the
absence of the axiom of choice.

this paper, we propose a multi-output multi-quantile deep learning approach for
jointly modeling several conditional quantiles together with the conditional
expectation as a way to provide a more complete ""picture"" of the predictive
density in spatio-temporal problems. Using two large-scale datasets from the
transportation domain, we empirically demonstrate that, by approaching the
quantile regression problem from a multi-task learning perspective, it is
possible to solve the embarrassing quantile crossings problem, while
simultaneously significantly outperforming state-of-the-art quantile regression
methods. Moreover, we show that jointly modeling the mean and several
conditional quantiles not only provides a rich description about the predictive
density that can capture heteroscedastic properties at a neglectable
computational overhead, but also leads to improved predictions of the
conditional expectation due to the extra information and a regularization
effect induced by the added quantiles.

star-formation rate surface density, stellar population age, and gas fraction,
which show that our galaxies are currently undergoing rapid mass assembly via
disk inside-out growth. More importantly, using a simple chemical evolution
model, we find that the gas fractions for different metallicity regions cannot
be explained by pure gas accretion. Our spatially resolved analysis based on a
more advanced gas regulator model results in a spatial map of net gaseous
outflows, triggered by active central starbursts, that potentially play a
significant role in shaping the spatial distribution of metallicity by
effectively transporting stellar nucleosynthesis yields outwards. The relation
between wind mass loading factors and stellar surface densities measured in
different regions of our galaxies shows that a single type of wind mechanism,
driven by either energy or momentum conservation, cannot explain the entire

nmUED is an incarnation of the Standard Model in $(4+1)$ space-time dimensions
compactified on an $\bf{S_1}/\bf{Z_2}$ orbifold supplemented with boundary
localized operators with unknown coefficients. These coefficients parametrize
the radiative corrections which are somehow arbitrary due to the lack of
knowledge of the cut-off scale of such effective theory. It is possible to tune
the masses and couplings of the Kaluza Klein (KK) excitations by tuning these
parameters. Two scenarios with different mass hierarchies among the
KK-excitations have been considered. A detailed study of production
cross-sections and different decay modes of KK-particles are also presented. We
calculate the correlated bounds on masses of KK-particles using the LHC $nl +
mj + E\!\!\!\!/_T$ data (in case of production of strongly interacting
particles) and $3l + E\!\!\!\!/_T$ data (in case of electroweak productions).
We work in a KK-parity conserving scenario where the lightest KK-particle is a
potential dark (DM) matter candidate. We use the additional constraints coming
from the observed DM relic density of the universe to identify the allowed
parameter space. The current status of a nmUED model in the light of DM direct
detection data is also examined. The present investigation reveals that
production and subsequent leptonic decays of KK-electroweak gauge bosons as

RNN parses natural language descriptions in two directions, and the attentive
model attends every meaningful word or phrase to each frame, thereby resulting
in a more detailed understanding of video content and description semantics.
Second, we design a hierarchical architecture for the network to jointly model
language descriptions and video content. Given a video-description pair, the
network generates a matrix representation, i.e., a sequence of vectors. Each
vector in the matrix represents a video frame conditioned by the description.
The 2D representation not only preserves the temporal dependencies of frames
but also provides an effective way to perform frame-level video-language
matching. The hierarchical architecture exploits video content with multiple
granularities, ranging from subtle details to global context. Integration of
the multiple granularities yields a robust representation for multi-level

operation is based on two core elements with interchangeable roles, entities

approximate such methods, termed phase space signal processing methods, using a

highly redundant continuous frames, since the number of samples required for a
certain accuracy is proportional to the dimension of the signal space, and not
to the dimension of the phase space. Moreover, even though the continuous frame
is highly redundant, the Monte Carlo samples are spread uniformly, and hence
represent the coefficient space more faithfully than standard frame

demonstrate that tuning of the insulating phase resistance in VO2 threshold

Some queries, however, only require a yes/no answer; such queries are often

queries by testing nonemptiness of query expressions. Another interesting way
for expressing boolean queries are containment statements of the form $Q_1
\subseteq Q_2$ where $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are query expressions. Here, for any input
instance $I$, the boolean query result is $\mathit{true}$ if $Q_1(I)$ is a
subset of $Q_2(I)$ and $\mathit{false}$ otherwise.
  In the present paper we will focus on nonemptiness and containment statements
about conjunctive queries. The main goal is to investigate the monotone
fragment of the containments of conjunctive queries. In particular, we show a
preservation like result for this monotone fragment. That is, we show that, in
expressive power, the monotone containments of conjunctive queries are exactly
equal to conjunctive queries under nonemptiness.

perturbed infinite plane (which is called a locally rough surface) with the
modulus of the total-field data (also called the phaseless near-field data) at
a fixed frequency in two dimensions. We consider the case where a Dirichlet
boundary condition is imposed on the locally rough surface. This problem models
inverse scattering of plane acoustic waves by a one-dimensional sound-soft,
locally rough surface; it also models inverse scattering of plane
electromagnetic waves by a locally perturbed, perfectly reflecting, infinite
plane in the TE polarization case. We prove that the locally rough surface is
uniquely determined by the phaseless near-field data generated by a countably
infinite number of plane waves and measured on an open domain above the locally
rough surface. Further, a direct imaging method is proposed to reconstruct the
locally rough surface from the phaseless near-field data generated by plane
waves and measured on the upper part of the circle with a sufficiently large
radius. Theoretical analysis of the imaging algorithm is derived by making use
of properties of the scattering solution and results from the theory of
oscillatory integrals (especially the method of stationary phase). Moreover, as
a by-product of the theoretical analysis, a similar direct imaging method with
full far-field data is also proposed to reconstruct the locally rough surface.
Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the imaging
algorithm with phaseless near-field data and full far-field data are fast,
accurate and very robust with respect to noise in the data.

Okada et al. (2015, Paper I), we investigate different phases of the ISM traced
by carbon-bearing species in four star-forming regions in the LMC, and model
the physical properties using the KOSMA-tau PDR model. We mapped 3--13
arcmin$^2$ areas in 30 Dor, N158, N160 and N159 along the molecular ridge of
the LMC in [CII]158um with GREAT on board SOFIA, and in CO(2-1) to (6-5),
$^{13}$CO(2-1) and (3-2), [CI]3P1-3P0 and 3P2-3P1 with APEX. In all four
star-forming regions, the line profiles of CO, $^{13}$CO, and [CI] emission are
similar, whereas [CII] typically shows wider line profiles or an additional
velocity component. For selected positions in N159 and 30 Dor, we observed the
velocity-resolved [OI] 145um and 63um lines for the first time with upGREAT. At
some positions, the [OI] line profiles match those of CO, at other positions
they are more similar to the [CII] profiles. We interpret the different line
profiles of CO, [CII] and [OI] as contributions from spatially separated clouds
and/or clouds in different physical phases, which give different line ratios
depending on their physical properties. We model the emission from the CO,
[CI], [CII], and [OI] lines and the far-infrared continuum emission using the
latest KOSMA-tau PDR model, which treats the dust-related physics consistently
and computes the dust continuum SED together with the line emission of the
chemical species. We find that the line and continuum emissions are not
well-reproduced by a single clump ensemble. Toward the CO peak at N159~W, we
propose a scenario that the CO, [CII], and [OI] 63um emission are weaker than
expected because of mutual shielding among clumps. (abridged for arXiv)

fast and reliable numerical models for robust control in order to carry out

known numerical model, the resistive force theory (RFT), incorporates local
viscous force coefficients with the local velocity of slender bodies in order
to find the resisting hydrodynamic forces, however, omitting the induced far

analysis via intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, i.e., the
time-dependent solution of 3-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations incorporated

results are then used to extract the correction coefficients with the help of a
cost function written based on the hydrodynamic power required to sustain the
continuous swimming of selected shape and design. The performance of the
corrections embedded in the RFT model is finally validated against the CFD

development. It regulates a wide range of processes throughout the plant.
Synthetic auxins exploit the auxin-signalling pathway and are valuable as
herbicidal agrochemicals. Currently, despite a diversity of chemical scaffolds
all synthetic auxins have a carboxylic acid as the active core group. By
applying bio-isosteric replacement we discovered that indole-3-tetrazole was
active by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrometry, showing that the
tetrazole could initiate assembly of the TIR1 auxin co-receptor complex. We
then tested the tetrazole's efficacy in a range of whole plant physiological
assays and in protoplast reporter assays which all confirmed auxin activity,
albeit rather weak. We then tested indole-3-tetrazole against the AFB5
homologue of TIR1, finding that binding was selective against TIR1, absent with
AFB5. The kinetics of binding to TIR1 are contrasted to those for the herbicide
picloram, which shows the opposite receptor preference as it binds to AFB5 with
far greater affinity than to TIR1. The basis of the preference of
indole-3-tetrazole for TIR1 was revealed to be a single residue substitution
using molecular docking, and assays using tir1 and afb5 mutant lines confirmed
selectivity in vivo. Given the potential that a TIR1-selective auxin might have
for unmasking receptor-specific actions, we followed a rational design, lead
optimisation campaign and a set of chlorinated indole-3-tetrazoles was
synthesised. Improved affinity for TIR1 and the preference for binding to TIR1
was maintained for 4- and 6-chloroindole-3-tetrazoles, coupled with improved
efficacy in vivo. This work expands the range of auxin chemistry for the design
of receptor-selective synthetic auxins.

and distance of pillars. Therefore, we design the effective impedance of the
antireflection coating to be the geometrical mean of the upper and lower
mediums impedance and we choose its height to be a quarter of operating
wavelength. Consequently, the reflection vanishes at the desired frequency and
fractional bandwidth of 56% is achieved with a criterion of 10% reflectance
(the refractive index of the substrate is assumed to be 4). The proposed
structure is symmetric in both directions. So, it is not sensitive to the
polarization of the incident wave at normal incidence. Furthermore, we show
that using the multilayer Chebyshev matching transformer of transmission line
theory increases the bandwidth of the antireflection up to 107% at the expense
of pass-band ripples. This structure can be used from very low frequencies up
to infrared regime by appropriate scaling.

problem is decomposed into two parts: the first part is to allocate RBs to OPs,
which we do so by extending the framework of many-to-one matching game with
externalities. The second part is to allocate power of small cell base stations
(SBSs) belonging to each OP, which is accomplished using reinforcement
learning. Assuming that the SBSs associated with each OPs are spatially
distributed according to Poisson point process (PPP), we show that pairwise
stable matchings achieve local maximas of the social welfare function. We
propose two algorithms to search for the stable matchings. Simulation results

by realizing the nilpotent covering graph into a nilpotent Lie group via
discrete harmonic maps. The limiting diffusion semigroup is generated by the
homogenized sub-Laplacian with a constant drift of the asymptotic direction on
the nilpotent Lie group, which is equipped with the Albanese metric associated
with the symmetrized random walk. We next prove a functional CLT (i.e.,
Donsker-type invariance principle) in a Holder space over the nilpotent Lie
group by combining the semigroup CLT, standard martingale techniques, and a
novel pathwise argument inspired by rough path theory. Applying the corrector
method, we finally extend these CLTs to the case where the realizations are not
necessarily harmonic.

the HL-LHC, and study additional physics topics that take advantage of the
forward acceptance of the LHCb spectrometer. The LHCb Upgrade I will begin
operation in 2020. Consolidation will occur, and modest enhancements of the
Upgrade I detector will be installed, in Long Shutdown 3 of the LHC (2025) and
these are discussed here. The main Upgrade II detector will be installed in
long shutdown 4 of the LHC (2030) and will build on the strengths of the
current LHCb experiment and the Upgrade I. It will operate at a luminosity up
to $ 2 \times 10^{34} \rm cm^{-2}s^{-1}$, ten times that of the Upgrade I
detector. New detector components will improve the intrinsic performance of the
experiment in certain key areas. An Expression Of Interest proposing Upgrade II
was submitted in February 2017. The physics case for the Upgrade II is
presented here in more depth. $CP$-violating phases will be measured with
precisions unattainable at any other envisaged facility. The experiment will
probe $b\to s \ell^+\ell^-$ and $b\to d \ell^+\ell^-$ transitions in both muon
and electron decays in modes not accessible at Upgrade I. Minimal flavour
violation will be tested with a precision measurement of the ratio of
$B(B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-)/B(B_s^0\to \mu^+\mu^-)$. Probing charm $CP$ violation at
the $10^{-5}$ level may result in its long sought discovery. Major advances in
hadron spectroscopy will be possible, which will be powerful probes of low
energy QCD. Upgrade II potentially will have the highest sensitivity of all the
LHC experiments on the Higgs to charm-quark couplings. Generically, the new
physics mass scale probed, for fixed couplings, will almost double compared
with the pre-HL-LHC era; this extended reach for flavour physics is similar to
that which would be achieved by the HE-LHC proposal for the energy frontier.

approach for improving the performance of neural machine translation (NMT)

challenging, especially in real-world systems where deep models and large

tasks as testbeds, we conduct a systematic study on how to train better NMT
models using reinforcement learning. We provide a comprehensive comparison of
several important factors (e.g., baseline reward, reward shaping) in RL
training. Furthermore, to fill in the gap that it remains unclear whether RL is
still beneficial when monolingual data is used, we propose a new method to
leverage RL to further boost the performance of NMT systems trained with
source/target monolingual data. By integrating all our findings, we obtain
competitive results on WMT14 English- German, WMT17 English-Chinese, and WMT17
Chinese-English translation tasks, especially setting a state-of-the-art
performance on WMT17 Chinese-English translation task.

  Adversarial Network- PART 1","16 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Over the past decades, a large number of techniques have emerged in modern
imaging systems to capture the exact information of the original scene
regardless of shake, motion, lighting conditions and etc., These developments
have progressively addressed the acquisition of images in high speed and high
resolutions. However, the various ineradicable real-time factors cause the
degradation of the information and the quality of the acquired images. The
available techniques are not intelligent enough to generalize this complex
phenomenon. Hence, it is necessary to develop an intellectual framework to
recover the possible information presented in the original scene. In this
article, we propose a kernel free framework based on conditional-GAN to recover
the information from the heavily damaged images. The degradation of images is
assumed to be occurred by the combination of a various blur. Learning parameter
of the cGAN is optimized by multi-component loss function that includes
improved wasserstein loss with regression loss function. The generator module
of this network is developed by using U-Net architecture with local Residual
connections and global skip connection. Local connections and a global skip
connection are implemented for the utilization of all stages of features.
Generated images show that the network has the potential to recover the
probable information of blurred images from the learned features. This research
work is carried out as a part of our IOP studio software 'Facial recognition
module'.

We derive the full probability distribution $P(R,n)$ of the number of records

dynamical evolution of water-rich embryos and planetesimals, located beyond the
snow line of systems around Sun-like stars, in order to determine what kind of
terrestrial-like planets could be formed in the habitable zone (hereafter HZ)
of these systems. To do this, we carry out N-body simulations of planetary
accretion, considering that the gas has been already dissipated from the disk
and a single giant planet has been formed beyond the snow line of the system,
at 3 au. We find that a giant planet with a value of mass between Saturn-mass
and Jupiter-mass, represents a limit from which the amount of water-rich
embryos that moves inward from beyond the snow line starts to decrease. From
this, our research suggests that giant planets more massive than one
Jupiter-mass become efficient dynamical barriers to inward-migrating water-rich
embryos. Moreover, we infer that the number of these embryos that survive in
the HZ significantly decreases for systems that host a giant planet more
massive than one Jupiter-mass. This result has important consequences
concerning the formation of terrestrial-like planets in the HZ with very high
water contents and could provide a selection criteria in the search of
potentially habitable exoplanets in systems that host a gaseous giant around
solar-type stars.

can spontaneously drive itself its tearing and peeling off a substrate, thus
producing long, micrometer sized, regular trapezoidal-shaped folded graphene
nanoribbons. As long as the size of the graphene flaps is above a threshold
value, the 'tug of war' between the forces of adhesion of graphene-graphene and
graphene-substrate, flexural strain of folded region and carbon-carbon (C-C)
covalent bonds favor the self-tearing and self-peeling off process. As the
detailed information regarding the atomic scale mechanism involved in the
process remains not fully understood, we carried out atomistic reactive
molecular dynamics simulations to address some features of the process. We show
that large thermal fluctuations can prevent the process by increasing the
probability of chemical reactions between carbon dangling bonds of adjacent
graphene layers. The effects of the strength of attraction between graphene and
the substrate on the ribbon growth velocities at the early stages of the
phenomenon were also investigated. Structures with initial armchair crack-edges

systematic effects: P-angle error, surface magnetic field effects, and
center-to-limb variations. An interpretation of the travel-time measurements is
obtained using a forward-modeling approach in the ray approximation. The
travel-time differences are similar in the southern hemisphere for cycles 23
and 24. However, they differ in the northern hemisphere between cycles 23 and
24. Except for cycle 24's northern hemisphere, the measurements favor a
single-cell meridional circulation model where the poleward flows persist down
to $\sim$0.8 $R_\odot$, accompanied by local inflows toward the activity belts
in the near-surface layers. Cycle 24's northern hemisphere is anomalous:
travel-time differences are significantly smaller when travel distances are
greater than 20$^\circ$. This asymmetry between northern and southern
hemispheres during cycle 24 was not present in previous measurements (e.g.,
Rajaguru & Antia 2015), which assumed a different P-angle error correction
where south-north travel-time differences are shifted to zero at the equator
for all travel distances. In our measurements, the travel-time differences at
the equator are zero for travel distances less than $\sim$30$^\circ$, but they
do not vanish for larger travel distances. This equatorial offset for large
travel distances need not be interpreted as a deep cross-equator flow; it could
be due to the presence of asymmetrical local flows at the surface near the end
points of the acoustic ray paths.

sequence of line segments while keeping the error introduced by the
approximation within some predetermined threshold. With the recent rise of edge
computing, PLA algorithms find a complete new set of applications with the
emphasis on reducing the volume of streamed data. In this study, we identify
two scenarios set in a data-stream processing context: data reduction in sensor
transmissions and datacenter storage. In connection to those scenarios, we
identify several streaming metrics and propose streaming protocols as
algorithmic implementations of several state of the art PLA techniques. In an
experimental evaluation, we measure the quality of the reviewed methods and
protocols and evaluate their performance against those streaming statistics.
All known methods have deficiencies when it comes to handling streaming-like
data, e.g. inflation of the input stream, high latency or poor average error.
Our experimental results highlight the challenges raised when transferring
those classical methods into the stream processing world and present
alternative techniques to overcome them and balance the related trade-offs.

on a variable $u$ that is able to detect inhomogeneities in the electron
density $\rho$ without using derivatives of $\rho$. Instead, $u$ depends on the
orbital energies which can also be used to measure how a system differs from
the homogeneous electron gas. Starting from the functional of Perdew, Burke,
and Ernzerhof (PBE) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 3865 (1996)], a functional depending
on $u$ is constructed. Tests on the lattice constant, bulk modulus, and
cohesive energy of solids show that this $u$-dependent PBE-like functional is
on average as accurate as the original PBE or its solid-state version PBEsol.
Since $u$ carries more nonlocality than the reduced density gradient $s$ used
in functionals of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) like PBE and
$\alpha$ used in meta-GGAs, it will be certainly useful for the future
development of more accurate exchange-correlation functionals.

the Universe evolution, the effective potential is a very good approximation of
the actual potential term. There is, however, a deviation between the two
occurring in the earliest moments of the evolution, which has an important role
on the behavior of the inflaton scalar field. In the studied cases, during this
initial time, the inflaton is increasing in absolute value, which seems
consistent with ""climbing up"" the effective potential. To investigate this
behavior, we use numerical integration to find the numerical potential and we
show that during the early stage of the evolution, the shape of the numerical
potential is very different from that of the effective one and instead of a
left plateau followed by steep slope, one observes only a slope with additional
local maximum and minimum. This result demonstrates that for complicated

(spectroscopic factor) and radius were fitted to the data. The present analysis
suggests that slightly larger spectroscopic factors are obtained when nonlocal

therefore confirmed in detail. To reach these conclusions, it is essential to

of the associated Riemannian geometry, and introducing the conformal anomaly,
we are able to determine the Hawking temperatures and entropies of the

increase detection of the absorber host galaxies. The point spread function of
the background quasar is modeled with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This

for Mg II absorbers indicates that low redshift Mg II absorber host galaxies
are likely star-forming galaxies transitioning into red quiescent galaxies,
with a low star formation rate of 2.2 $M_\odot$ $yr^{-1}$. From the stacked

5 times smaller than that of Mg II absorbers, at < 7 kpc instead of Mg II
absorbers' 48 kpc, indicating that 2DAs are likely associated with disk

have gauge-independent values, this raises the question of whether the

is physically meaningful, or merely a feature of a particular mathematical

established synchronisation patterns. It turns out that mobile ambients are not
fully distributed, because they can express enough synchronisation to express a
synchronisation pattern called M. However, they can express strictly less
synchronisation than the standard pi-calculus. For this reason, we can show
that there is no good and distributability-preserving encoding from the
standard pi-calculus into mobile ambients and also no such encoding from mobile
ambients into the join-calculus, i.e., the expressive power of mobile ambients

ability when trained on large pixel-wise annotated image datasets. It remains a
major challenge however to aggregate such datasets, as the time and monetary
cost associated with collecting extensive annotations is extremely high. This
is particularly the case for generating precise pixel-wise annotations in video
and volumetric image data. To this end, this work presents a novel framework to
produce pixel-wise segmentations using minimal supervision. Our method relies
on 2D point supervision, whereby a single 2D location within an object of
interest is provided on each image of the data. Our method then estimates the
object appearance in a semi-supervised fashion by learning
object-image-specific features and by using these in a semi-supervised learning
framework. Our object model is then used in a graph-based optimization problem
that takes into account all provided locations and the image data in order to
infer the complete pixel-wise segmentation. In practice, we solve this
optimally as a tracking problem using a K-shortest path approach. Both the
object model and segmentation are then refined iteratively to further improve
the final segmentation. We show that by collecting 2D locations using a gaze
tracker, our approach can provide state-of-the-art segmentations on a range of
objects and image modalities (video and 3D volumes), and that these can then be
used to train supervised machine learning classifiers.

  Omnidirectional Fourier Imaging System with Centimeter Field of View","4 pages, 2 columns, 4 figures, submit to Optics Letters",,,,"physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We demonstrate a Fourier Imaging system with centimeter field of view(FOV),
and 0.0042{\deg}angular resolution at C band, for the entire 180{\deg}
radiation angular range. To pursue omnidirectional Fourier imaging without
aberration, a technique called angular synthetic aperture is employed, by
multi-perspective imaging and stitching. The effect of tilting-introduced
virtual lens is pointed out and dealt with in our system. For the sake of
limited sensor size and aberration spot size, Fourier imaging at each
perspective is restricted to angle range smaller than 3{\deg}. The imaging
system with a 4f demagnification component is prudently designed to magnify
Fourier imaging, relieving the pressure of pixel size of sensor for high
sampling rate, meanwhile guarantee the 1cm object FOV within 3{\deg}range. All
the system is automatically controlled, which is crucial for applications such
as online-optimization for optical phased array(OPA). As far as we know, this
is the state-of-art omnidirectional Fourier imaging system as to field of view
and resolution.

  Technique for Nanofabrication",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a light-sheet based plane-selective fabrication technique that
enables fabrication of nano-electronic/nano-fluidic components (nano-wires,
nano-waveguides, nano-gratings and nano-channels) with specificity, selectivity
on a user-defined patterning area. The technique is termed as, interfering
coherent lightsheet assisted structure synthesis (iCLASS). iCLASS use
specialized $2\pi$-geometry (consists of two opposing cylindrical lenses) that
facilitates interference of counter-propagating light-sheets at a common
geometrical focus. This gives rise to 1D interference pattern with a feature
size of less than diffraction limit. A commercially available S1813 photoresist
coated on a cleaned glass substrate is subsequently exposed to the light-sheets
pattern (visible light). This is followed by the development of photoresist
film to imprint the 1D nano-pattern. Experimental study and analysis shows an
inter-feature spacing and feature-size of approximately, $\lambda/2$.
Investigation show that the light-dose interaction-time ($\tau_{exp}
+\tau_{dev}$) play crucial role in determining the feature-size and quality of
fabricated nano-pattern array. The proposed iCLASS technique may find
applications in nanoscience and nanotechnology.

the same organisation or collaborations involving multiple interacting
participants. It results that providing a solid foundation to enable BPMN
designers to understand their models in a consistent way is becoming more and
more important. In our investigation we define and exploit a formal
characterisation of the collaborations' semantics, specifically and directly
given for BPMN models, to provide a classification of BPMN collaborations. In
particular, we refer to collaborations involving processes with arbitrary
topology, thus overcoming the well-structuredness limitations. The proposed
classification is based on some of the most important correctness properties in
the business process domain, namely safeness and soundness. We prove, with a
uniform formal framework, some conjectured and expected results and, most of
all, we achieve novel results for BPMN collaborations concerning the
relationships between safeness and soundness, and their compositionality, that
represent major advances in the state-of-the-art.
