We develop an extended percolation method to allow the comparison of
geometrical properties of the real cosmic web with the simulated dark matter
web for an ensemble of over- and under-density systems. Methods. We scan
density fields of dark matter (DM) model and SDSS observational samples, and
find connected over- and underdensity regions in a large range of threshold
densities. Lengths, filling factors and numbers of largest clusters and voids
as functions of the threshold density are used as percolation functions.
Results. We find that percolation functions of DM models of different box sizes
are very similar to each other. This stability suggests that properties of the
cosmic web, as found in the present paper, can be applied to the cosmic web as
a whole. Percolation functions depend strongly on the smoothing length. At
smoothing length 1 $h^{-1}$ Mpc the percolation threshold density for clusters
is $\log P_C = 0.718 \pm 0.014$, and for voids is $\log P_V = -0.816 \pm
0.015$, very different from percolation thresholds for random samples, $\log
P_0 = 0.00 \pm 0.02$. Conclusions. The extended percolation analysis is a
versatile method to study various geometrical properties of the cosmic web in a
wide range of parameters. Percolation functions of the SDSS sample are very
different from percolation functions of DM model samples. The SDSS sample has
only one large percolating void which fills almost the whole volume. The SDSS
sample contains numerous small isolated clusters at low threshold densities,
instead of one single percolating DM cluster. These differences are due to the
tenuous dark matter web, present in model samples, but absent in real
observational samples.

wavelength is a central ingredient in contemporary photometric calibration
strategies. This typically entails propagating narrowband illumination through
the system pupil, and comparing the detected photon rate across the focal plane
to the amount of incident light as measured by a calibrated photodiode.
However, stray light effects and reflections/ghosting (especially on the edges
of filter passbands) in the optical train constitute a major source of
systematic uncertainty when using a flat-field screen as the illumination
source. A collimated beam projector that projects a mask onto the focal plane
of the instrument can distinguish focusing light paths from stray and scattered
light, allowing for a precise determination of instrumental throughput. This
paper describes the conceptual design of such a system, outlines its merits,
and presents results from a prototype system used with the Dark Energy Camera
wide field imager on the 4-meter Blanco telescope. A calibration scheme that
blends results from flat-field images with collimated beam projector data to
obtain the equivalent of an illumination correction at high spectral and
angular resolution is also presented. In addition to providing a precise system
throughput calibration, by monitoring the evolution of the intensity and
behaviour of the ghosts in the optical system, the collimated beam projector
can be used to track the evolution of the filter transmission properties and
various anti-reflective coatings in the optical system.

in past years, S-type planets have not yet been found in close binaries with an
orbital separation not more than 5 au. Recent studies suggest that S-type
planets in close binaries may be detected through high-accuracy observations.
However, nowadays planet formation theories imply that it is difficult for
S-type planets in close binaries systems to form in situ. In this work, we
extensively perform numerical simulations to explore scenarios of planet-planet
scattering among circumbinary planets and subsequent tidal capture in various
binary configurations, to examine whether the mechanism can play a part in
producing such kind of planets. Our results show that this mechanism is robust.
The maximum capture probability is $\sim 10\%$, which can be comparable to the
tidal capture probability of hot Jupiters in single star systems. The capture
probability is related to binary configurations, where a smaller eccentricity
or a low mass ratio of the binary will lead to a larger probability of capture,
and vice versa. Furthermore, we find that S-type planets with retrograde orbits
can be naturally produced via capture process. These planets on retrograde
orbits can help us distinguish in situ formation and post-capture origin for
S-type planet in close binaries systems. The forthcoming missions (PLATO) will
provide the opportunity and feasibility to detect such planets. Our work
provides several suggestions for selecting target binaries in search for S-type
planets in the near future.

in $(2+1)$-dimensional quantum chromodynamics based on symmetries, topology,

intermediate and high density regimes are modeled through effective
four-fermion interactions, which include attractive scalar and diquark terms,
with a term to account for vector meson repulsion at high densities. We address
beyond-mean-field phenomena by constructing the quantum field theory for
fluctuations in internal degrees of freedom of the baryon ground state using a
Madelung decomposition. A key QPT occurs at the meson-diquark transition driven
by the ratio of baryon chemical potential to quark mass, $\mu_B/m$, or to an
external applied magnetic field, $\mu_B/|eB|$. Properties of the system at
${\mu^c_B} \equiv m, |eB|$ stem from diverging quantum fluctuations of a
continuous field $\gamma$ that modulates the spin-space angular positions of
baryon potential minima, identified with discrete chiral $\mathbb{Z}_2^\sigma$,
$\mathbb{Z}_2^{LR} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{LR}$, and $\mathbb{Z}_4^\chi$

competition between $\mu_B$ and $m$ (or $B$), destroys superconductivity via a
\emph{quantum} Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition at
${\mu^c_B}$. Moreover, the large $\gamma$ fluctuations at ${\mu^c_B }$ behave
as an additional momentum scale, resulting in an effective $(3+1)$d conformal
critical theory there. We use these insights to elucidate the nature of
\emph{holographic} BKT transitions, from the field theory side, a result which

invariant. These topological properties require a nonzero Berry curvature, and
its origin is ascribed to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions or the
noncoplanar magnetic ordering generating a U(1) gauge field that couples to the
kinetic motion of magnons. Although this picture is established in ferromagnets
on the kagome and pyrochlore lattices, it does not apply to our square lattice
model since such gauge field cancels out in an edge shared geometry. Instead,
our case has an analogy with the anomalous Hall effect of Rashba electronic
system where the spin orbit coupling generates an SU(2) gauge field. The two
species of magnons defined on antiferromagnetic sublattices can be regarded as
the pseudo-spin degrees of freedom of magnons. The DM interactions that emerge
due to the SIS breaking serve as a pseudo-spin orbit coupling of magnons and
generate a Berry curvature, when the direction of the magnetic moments is
properly controlled by the magnetic field. The thermal Hall conductivity of our
antiferromagnet shows rapid growth in temperature T beyond the power-law,
reflecting the almost gapless low energy branch of the antiferromagnet, which
distinctively differs from the T^7/2 -dependence in the pyrochlore

processing. Unfortunately, it is very resource-intensive to compute an
equi-join across massive datasets. The approximate computing paradigm allows
users to trade accuracy and latency for expensive data processing operations.
The equi-join operator is thus a natural candidate for optimization using
approximation techniques. Although sampling-based approaches are widely used
for approximation, sampling over joins is a compelling but challenging task
regarding the output quality. Naive approaches, which perform joins over
dataset samples, would not preserve statistical properties of the join output.
  To realize this potential, we interweave Bloom filter sketching and
stratified sampling with the join computation in a new operator, ApproxJoin,
that preserves the statistical properties of the join output. ApproxJoin
leverages a Bloom filter to avoid shuffling non-joinable data items around the
network and then applies stratified sampling to obtain a representative sample
of the join output.
  Our analysis shows that ApproxJoin scales well and significantly reduces data
movement, without sacrificing tight error bounds on the accuracy of the final
results. We implemented ApproxJoin in Apache Spark and evaluated ApproxJoin
using microbenchmarks and real-world case studies. The evaluation shows that
ApproxJoin achieves a speedup of 6-9x over unmodified Spark-based joins with
the same sampling rate. Furthermore, the speedup is accompanied by a
significant reduction in the shuffled data volume, which is 5-82x less than
unmodified Spark-based joins.

In the first case, we fix a unit cell consisting of 8 lattice points and survey
the energy eigenvalues in the presence of up to 2 point defects. Then it turns
out that the existence of the fractal energy structure, called Hofstadter's
butterfly, depends on the choice of defect pairs. In the second case, we extend
the size of a unit cell which contains a single point defect and up to 32

exist a robust gapless point in the $E=0$ eV line without depending on both the

Consequently we predict that the presence of a butterfly in a graph is

restrictive mass, volume and power consumption requirements. The implementation
of an X-ray observatory sized instrument is unrealistic in this case. The
Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS) instrument, due to be launched on the

that may be further developed as a practical telescope for XNAV. Simulations
involving different pulsar combinations and navigation strategies are used to
estimate the navigation uncertainties that may be achievable using such an
instrument. Possible options for future developments in terms of simpler,
lower-cost Kirkpatrick-Baez optics are discussed, in addition to the principal
design and development challenges that must be addressed in order to realise an

kinematic modeling of the jaw, i.e., the Temporo-Mandibular Joint (TMJ).
Previous work often relies on simple models of jaw kinematics, even though the
actual physiological behavior of the TMJ is quite complex, allowing not only
for mouth opening, but also for some amount of sideways (lateral) and
front-to-back (protrusion) motions. Fortuitously, the TMJ is the only joint
whose kinematics can be accurately measured with optical methods, because the
bones of the lower and upper jaw are rigidly connected to the lower and upper
teeth. We construct a person-specific jaw kinematic model by asking an actor to
exercise the entire range of motion of the jaw while keeping the lips open so
that the teeth are at least partially visible. This performance is recorded
with three calibrated cameras. We obtain highly accurate 3D models of the teeth
with a standard dental scanner and use these models to reconstruct the rigid
body trajectories of the teeth from the videos (markerless tracking). The
relative rigid transformations samples between the lower and upper teeth are
mapped to the Lie algebra of rigid body motions in order to linearize the
rotational motion. Our main contribution is to fit these samples with a
three-dimensional nonlinear model parameterizing the entire range of motion of
the TMJ. We show that standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) fails to
capture the nonlinear trajectories of the moving mandible. However, we found
these nonlinearities can be captured with a special modification of autoencoder
neural networks known as Nonlinear PCA. By mapping back to the Lie group of
rigid transformations, we obtain parameterization of the jaw kinematics which
provides an intuitive interface allowing the animators to explore realistic jaw
motions in a user-friendly way.

constant force dragging the corresponding field to the non-zero value. This
force explicitly breaks quantum numbers associated with dark matter/baryon
abundance at later stages. As a particular realization of the mechanism we
introduce a super-heavy complex scalar field with the mass larger than the
Hubble rate during the last e-folds of inflation. The global U(1)-symmetry is
violated due to the linear coupling of the phase of the complex scalar to the
inflaton. The symmetry breaking leads to the generation of a non-zero Noether
charge. The latter is directly related to the dark matter abundance, or,
alternatively, can be converted into baryon asymmetry, if the complex scalar

communication for mobile edge computing (MEC) systems to improve the energy
efficiency for latency-constrained computation. We consider a basic three-node
MEC system consisting of a user node, a helper node, and an access point (AP)
node attached with an MEC server, in which the user has latency-constrained and
computation-intensive tasks to be executed. We consider two different
computation offloading models, namely the partial and binary offloading,
respectively. Under this setup, we focus on a particular finite time block and
develop an efficient four-slot transmission protocol to enable the joint
computation and communication cooperation. Besides the local task computing
over the whole block, the user can offload some computation tasks to the helper
in the first slot, and the helper cooperatively computes these tasks in the
remaining time; while in the second and third slots, the helper works as a
cooperative relay to help the user offload some other tasks to the AP for
remote execution in the fourth slot. For both cases with partial and binary
offloading, we jointly optimize the computation and communication resources
allocation at both the user and the helper (i.e., the time and transmit power
allocations for offloading, and the CPU frequencies for computing), so as to
minimize their total energy consumption while satisfying the user's computation
latency constraint. Although the two problems are non-convex in general, we
propose efficient algorithms to solve them optimally. Numerical results show
that the proposed joint computation and communication cooperation approach

correlated with SN distance measurements than global properties or properties
measured at random locations in SN hosts. At $\lesssim2\sigma$ significance,
local properties tend to correlate with distance residuals better than
properties at random locations, though despite using the largest low-$z$ sample
to date we cannot definitively prove that a local correlation is more
significant than a random correlation. Our data hint that SNe observed by
surveys that do not target a pre-selected set of galaxies may have a larger
local mass step than SNe from surveys that do, an increase of $0.071\pm0.036$
mag (2.0$\sigma$). We find a $3\sigma$ local mass step after global mass
correction, evidence that SNe Ia should be corrected for their local mass, but
we note that this effect is insignificant in the targeted low-$z$ sample. Only
the local mass step remains significant at $>2\sigma$ after global mass
correction, and we conservatively estimate a systematic shift in H$_0$

and an outer cold massive giant planet, which was detected via radial velocity.
The inner transiting planet, HATS-59b, is on an eccentric orbit with $e =
0.129\pm0.049$, orbiting a $V=13.951\pm0.030$ mag solar-like star ($M_* =
1.038\pm0.039 M_{\odot}$, and $R_* = 1.036\pm0.067 R_{\odot}$) with a period of
$5.416077\pm0.000017$ days. The outer companion, HATS-59c is on a circular
orbit with $ m \sin i = 12.8\pm1.1 M_\mathrm{J}$, and a period of $1422\pm14$
days. The inner planet has a mass of $0.806\pm0.069 M_\mathrm{J}$ and a radius
of $1.126\pm0.077 M_\mathrm{J}$, yielding a density of $0.70\pm0.16 {\rm
g\,cm^{-3}}$. Unlike most of the planetary systems that include only a single
hot Jupiter, HATS-59b,c includes, in addition to the transiting hot Jupiter, a
massive outer companion. The architecture of this system is valuable for
understanding planet migration.

  Volume 14, Number 2, ISSN 1820 - 4511",,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper summarizes the ideas and key concepts in MISE (Memory
Interference-induced Slowdown Estimation), which was published in HPCA 2013
[97], and examines the work's significance and future potential. Applications
running concurrently on a multicore system interfere with each other at the
main memory. This interference can slow down different applications
differently. Accurately estimating the slowdown of each application in such a
system can enable mechanisms that can enforce quality-of-service. While much
prior work has focused on mitigating the performance degradation due to
inter-application interference, there is little work on accurately estimating
slowdown of individual applications in a multi-programmed environment. Our goal
is to accurately estimate application slowdowns, towards providing predictable
performance.
  To this end, we first build a simple Memory Interference-induced Slowdown
Estimation (MISE) model, which accurately estimates slowdowns caused by memory
interference. We then leverage our MISE model to develop two new memory
scheduling schemes: 1) one that provides soft quality-of-service guarantees,
and 2) another that explicitly attempts to minimize maximum slowdown (i.e.,
unfairness) in the system. Evaluations show that our techniques perform
significantly better than state-of-the-art memory scheduling approaches to
address the same problems.
  Our proposed model and techniques have enabled significant research in the
development of accurate performance models [35, 59, 98, 110] and interference
management mechanisms [66, 99, 100, 108, 119, 120].

in intent. This intent can range from benign to malicious, with many tactics
being used to achieve their goals. One lesser studied tactic is content
republishing, which can be used to make specific stories seem more important,
create uncertainty around an event, or create a perception of credibility for
unreliable news sources. In this paper, we take a first step in understanding
this tactic by exploring verbatim content copying across 92 news producers of
various characteristics. We find that content copying occurs more frequently
between like-audience sources (eg. alternative news, mainstream news, etc.),
but there consistently exists sparse connections between these communities. We
also find that despite articles being verbatim, the headlines are often
changed. Specifically, we find that mainstream sources change more structural
features, while alternative sources change many more content features, often
changing the emotional tone and bias of the titles. We conclude that content
republishing networks can help identify and label the intent of brand-new news
sources using the tight-knit community they belong to. In addition, it is
possible to use the network to find important content producers in each
community, producers that are used to amplify messages of other sources, and
producers that distort the messages of other sources.

sample is made by deep large-area Subaru narrowband observations conducted by
the Cosmic HydrOgen Reionization Unveiled with Subaru (CHORUS) project. The

DECam and Subaru studies at the bright and faint ends, respectively, while our

investigate the shape of the faint to bright-end Ly$\alpha$ LF. We find that

of the UV-continuum LD estimated with dropouts. The Ly$\alpha$ LD monotonically

take into account various feedback processes. In order to reproduce the overall
redshift evolution we require the efficiency of converting gas into stars to
decrease with decreasing redshift. Even for $z\ge 6$, our models require
supernovae (SNe) feedback to reproduce the observed LF suggesting the
prevalence of galactic winds that could have polluted the inter-galactic medium
even at very high redshifts. The observed LF in the low luminosity end for
$z<2.5$ shows an upward turn. In our models we reproduce this trend using
passively evolving population of galaxies. Measuring stellar mass, age and
metallicity of these galaxies using multi-band spectral energy distribution
(SED) fitting will place strong constraints on the existence of such galaxies.
While Active galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback is essential to reproduce the LF at
high luminosity end for $z<4$, it may not needed in the case of $z\ge 6$. We
show that the expected turn around in the LF due to cooling criteria occurs at
luminosity much lower than what has been probed with present day observations.
With future deep observations, that can measure the LF more accurately, we will
be able to distinguish between different modes of SNe feedback and get insights
into the physical processes that drive the galaxy evolution.

gapless fermions coupled to a massless $U(1)$ gauge field. We discuss its

slightly with stellar mass from 0.35 dex at M$_{\rm star} \approx 10^9$

(ranging from 0.2-2 Gyr) that are presumably associated with self-regulation
from cooling, star formation and outflows, but is dominated by long time-scale
($\sim 10$ Gyr) variations related to differences in halo formation times.
Shorter time-scale fluctuations are relatively more important for lower-mass
galaxies. At high masses, differences in black hole formation efficiency cause
additional scatter, but also diminish the scatter caused by different halo
formation times. While individual galaxies cross the main sequence multiple
times during their evolution, they fluctuate around tracks associated with
their halo properties, i.e. galaxies above/below the main sequence at $z = 0.1$
tend to have been above/below the main sequence for $\gg1$ Gyr.

baryon fractions inside the host galaxies, between 7 and 100 percent.
Similarly, we find gas fractions between 3 and 56 percent. Given their star
formation rates, these objects lie on the expected main sequence of galaxies.
Emission line metallicities indicate they are consistent with the
mass-metallicity relation for DLAs. We also report an apparent anti-correlation
between the stellar masses and $N$(HI), which could be due to a dust bias

different inclination between the disk plane and the orbital plane. The

simulations show similar local and global non-axisymmetric effects such as
local instabilities in the disk and the jet, or global features such as disk
spiral arms and warps, or a global re-alignment of the inflow-outflow
structure. The disk accretion rate is higher than for axisymmetric simulations,
most probably due to the enhanced angular momentum transport by spiral waves.
The disk outflow leaves the Roche lobe of the primary and becomes disturbed by
tidal effects. While a disk-orbit inclination of $10\degr$ still allows for a
persistent outflow, an inclination of $30\degr$ does not, suggesting a critical
angle in between. For moderate inclination we find indication for jet
precession such that the jet axis starts to follow a circular pattern with an
opening cone of $\simeq 8\degr$. Simulations with different mass ratio indicate
a change of time scales for the tidal forces to affect the disk-jet system. A
large mass ratio (a massive secondary) leads to stronger spiral arms, a higher

host galaxies span the full range of stellar masses in our sample. Galaxies
which host shells are predominantly red and massive: we find that observable
shells form more frequently around ellipticals than around disc galaxies of the
same stellar mass. Although the majority of the shells in our sample are
consistent with being formed by minor mergers, $15\% \pm 4.4\%$ of shell host
galaxies have $(g-i)$ colors as red as their host galaxy, consistent with being
formed by major mergers. These ""red shells"" are additionally preferentially
aligned with the major axis of the host galaxy, as previously predicted from

population originates from fairly minor mergers, which preferentially form
shells that are not aligned with the major axis of the galaxy, major mergers
produce a significant number of observable shells.

separate our Hamiltonian into a harmonic portion and a coupling portion; the
partition function can then be calculated as the product of a Monte Carlo

normalization factor (that is evaluated analytically). A Gaussian mixture model
is used to evaluate the Monte Carlo estimator in a computationally efficient

of solutions properly satisfy the sufficient condition required for
satisfactory inflation, which is equivalent to get an inflationary phase in the
conformal Einstein frame (EF) without branch change. Concerning the
cosmological dynamics, we further show that our NC framework bears close

This, however, may render ASR tools to generate incorrect repairs that do not

typical ways separately: (1) Automated annotation, wherein patches are
automatically labeled by an independent test suite (ITS) - a patch passing the
ITS is regarded as correct or generalizable, and incorrect otherwise, (2)
Author annotation, wherein authors of ASR techniques annotate correctness
labels of patches generated by their and competing tools by themselves. While
automated annotation fails to prove that a patch is actually correct, author
annotation is prone to subjectivity. This concern has caused an on-going debate
on appropriate ways to assess the effectiveness of numerous ASR techniques
proposed recently. To address this concern, we propose to assess reliability of
author and automated annotations on patch correctness assessment. We do this by

question of how a general warm inflation dynamics can be realized in LQC with
an appropriate number of e-folds, but also how such dynamics is constrained to
be in agreement with the latest cosmic microwave background radiation from
Planck. The fraction of warm inflation trajectories in LQC that gives both the
required minimum amount e-folds of expansion and also passes through the

$T\lesssim 0.35T_{\mathrm{c}p}$, where $T_{\mathrm{c}p}$ is the critical
temperature of the proton pairing. In this case, lepton collisions with protons
can be neglected. Charged lepton collision frequencies are mainly determined by
the transverse plasmon exchange and are mediated by the character of the
transverse plasma screening. In our previous works [Shternin \& Yakovlev, Phys.

the typical transferred momentum in collisions. However, for large critical
temperatures (large $\Delta$) and relatively small densities (small $q$) the
Pippard limit may become invalid. In the present study I show that this is
indeed the case and that the older calculations severely underestimated the

Our estimate of the pseudocritical temperature compares favorably with
continuum results from staggered and domain wall fermions, confirming that a
dynamical charm does not contribute in the transition region. From the high
temperature behaviour of the disconnected chiral susceptibility we infer the
topological susceptibility, which encodes relevant properties of the QCD axion,
a plausible Dark Matter candidate. The topological susceptibility thus measured
exhibits a power-law decay for $T/T_c \gtrsim 2$, with an exponent close to the
one predicted by the Dilute Instanton Gas Approximation (DIGA). Close to $T_c$
the temperature dependent effective exponent seems to approach the DIGA result

heavy quark. When heavy quarks are involved in a jet, the quark mass can lead
to a numerically significant correction to the jet cross section and its
substructure. With this motivation, we calculated the heavy quark mass effects
to next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$ on the fragmentation functions to a jet
(FFJs) and the jet fragmentation functions (JFFs), where the former describes
fragmentation of parton into a jet and the latter describes fragmenting
processes inside a jet. The finite size of the heavy quark mass does not change
the ultraviolet behaviors, but it can give significant corrections to the
finite contributions. When we take the zero mass limit, we find that the FFJs
and the JFFs reproduce established results for massless partons. If we define
the heavy quark jet as one that include at least one heavy (anti-)quark, the
tagged heavy quark jet production is sensitive to the heavy quark mass and
produces large logarithms of the mass. Taking advantage of the FFJs and JFFs,
we formulate a factorization theorem for heavy quark jet production in order to
resum these large logarithms systematically. As an application, we study
inclusive $b$-jet production and show phenomenological implications due to
keeping a non-zero quark mass.

on a ""product-convolution"" interpolation of convolution operators. This scheme
is appropriate for operators that are locally translation-invariant, even if
these operators are high-rank or full-rank. Such operators arise in Schur
complement methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), as
Hessians in PDE-constrained optimization and inverse problems, as integral
operators, as covariance operators, and as Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps.
Constructing the approximation requires computing the impulse responses of the
operator to point sources centered on nodes in an adaptively refined grid of
sample points. A randomized a-posteriori error estimator drives the adaptivity.
Once constructed, the approximation can be efficiently applied to vectors using
the fast Fourier transform. The approximation can be efficiently converted to
hierarchical matrix ($H$-matrix) format, then inverted or factorized using
scalable $H$-matrix arithmetic. The quality of the approximation degrades
gracefully as fewer sample points are used, allowing cheap lower quality
approximations to be used as preconditioners. This yields an automated method
to construct preconditioners for locally translation-invariant Schur
complements. We directly address issues related to boundaries and prove that
our scheme eliminates boundary artifacts. We test the scheme on a spatially
varying blurring kernel, on the non-local component of an interface Schur
complement for the Poisson operator, and on the data misfit Hessian for an
advection dominated advection-diffusion inverse problem. Numerical results show
that the scheme outperforms existing methods.

intentions is thought to be essential for effective interactions with other
agents. Recently, multiagent systems trained via deep reinforcement learning
have been shown to succeed in solving different tasks, but it remains unclear
how each agent modeled or represented other agents in their environment. In
this work we test whether deep reinforcement learning agents explicitly
represent other agents' intentions (their specific aims or goals) during a task
in which the agents had to coordinate the covering of different spots in a 2D
environment. In particular, we tracked over time the performance of a linear
decoder trained to predict the final goal of all agents from the hidden state
of each agent's neural network controller. We observed that the hidden layers
of agents represented explicit information about other agents' goals, i.e. the
target landmark they ended up covering. We also performed a series of
experiments, in which some agents were replaced by others with fixed goals, to
test the level of generalization of the trained agents. We noticed that during
the training phase the agents developed a differential preference for each
goal, which hindered generalization. To alleviate the above problem, we propose
simple changes to the MADDPG training algorithm which leads to better
generalization against unseen agents. We believe that training protocols
promoting more active intention reading mechanisms, e.g. by preventing simple
symmetry-breaking solutions, is a promising direction towards achieving a more
robust generalization in different cooperative and competitive tasks.

is challenging, as such videos often contain noise, drift due to camera motion
and from cycle to cycle, and irrelevant background motion/occlusions, and these
factors can confound the relevant periodic motion we seek in the video. To
address these issues in a simple and efficient manner, we introduce a tracking
free Eulerian approach for synthesizing a single cycle of motion. Our approach
is geometric: we treat each frame as a point in high-dimensional Euclidean
space, and analyze the sliding window embedding formed by this sequence of
points, which yields samples along a topological loop regardless of the type of
periodic motion. We combine tools from topological data analysis and spectral
geometric analysis to estimate the phase of each window, and we exploit the
sliding window structure to robustly reorder frames. We show quantitative
results that highlight the robustness of our technique to camera shake, noise,

approach combined with a multiplicative decomposition-based selective
integration for volumetric and shear deformation modes. This approach is
significantly different from the co-rotational formulations typically

into translation, rotation, plastic stretches, elastic stretches, volumetric
stretches, shear stretches, etc. This approach can be implemented for a whole

FDEM based material formulation was designed in such a way that the anisotropic
properties of the solid can be specified in a cell by cell basis, therefore
enabling the user to seed these anisotropic properties following any type of
spatial variation, for example, following a curvilinear path. In addition, due
to the selective integration, there are no problems with volumetric or shear

resonances probed with Ramsey spectroscopy is investigated experimentally and
theoretically. Measurements with laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb atoms show excellent
quantitative agreement with a simple theory. The shift depends on the relative
intensity of the two CPT light fields, but depends only weakly on the total
intensity. Since the origin of the shift is through couplings of the
interrogation light to off-resonant excited state hyperfine levels, the size
and sign of the shift depend on the specific interrogation scheme. However, the
simple theory shows that for several commonly used interrogation schemes the
off-resonant shift goes to zero at specific values of this relative intensity.

ideally suited for investigating the dynamics of central nuclear reactions.
Many particles actively participate in those reactions. At the two energy
extremes for the collisions, the limiting cases of the Green's function
approach have been successful: the time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory at low
energy and Boltzmann equation at high. The strategy for computational
adaptation of the Green's function to central reactions is discussed. The
strategy involves, in particular, incremental progression from one to three
dimensions to develop and assess approximations, discarding of far-away
function elements, use of effective interactions and preparation of initial
states for the reactions through adiabatic switching. At this stage we
concentrate on inclusion of correlations in one dimension, where relatively few
approximations are needed, and we carry out reference calculations that can
benchmark approximations needed for more dimensions. We switch on short-range
interactions generating the correlations adiabatically in the Kadanoff-Baym
equations to arrive at correlated ground states for uniform matter. As the
energy of the correlated matter does not quite match the expectations for
nuclear matter we add mean field to arrive at the match in energy. From there
on, we move to finite systems. In switching on the correlations we observe
emergence of extended tails in momentum distributions and evolution of single
particle occupations away from 1 and 0.

utilize an in-house implementation of the Combined Finite-Discrete Element

pre-existing cracks within the specimens follow two geometric patterns: 1) a
single crack oriented at different angles with respect to the loading
direction, and 2) two cracks, where one crack is oriented perpendicular to the
loading direction and the other crack is oriented at different angles. The
intent of this study is to demonstrate the suitability of FDEM for modeling
fracture coalescence processes including: crack initiation and propagation,
tensile and shear fracture behavior, and patterns of fracture coalescence. The
simulations provide insight into the evolution of fracture tensile and shear
fracture behavior as a function of time. The single-crack simulations
accurately reproduce experimentally measured peak stresses as a function of
crack inclination angle. Both the single- and double-crack simulations exhibit
a linear increase in strength with increasing crack angle; the double-crack

collision and reduce the waiting time to cross the intersection. Three
different patterns of traffic flow towards the intersection have been tested.
The system requires less waiting time, compared to the other models, including
the random case where the flow is unpredictable. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

from observational data. Confounding can be defined as a statistical
association between two variables due to inputs from a common source (the
confounder). For example, if $Z\rightarrow Y$ and $Z\rightarrow X$, then $X$
and $Y$ will be statistically dependent, even if there are no causal
connections between the two. There are several approaches available to adjust
for confounding, i.e. to remove, or reduce, the association between two
variables due to the confounder. Common adjustment techniques include
stratifying the analysis on the confounder, and including confounders as
covariates in regression models. Most adjustments rely on the assumption that
the causal effects of confounders, on different variables, do not co-vary. For
example, if the causal effect of $Z$ on $X$ and the causal effect of $Z$ on $Y$
co-vary between observational units, a confounding effect remains after
adjustment for $Z$. This causal-effect covariability and its consequences is
the topic of this paper.
  Causal-effect covariability is first explicated using the framework of
structural causal models. Using this framework it is easy to show that
causal-effect covariability generally leads to confounding that cannot be
adjusted for by standard methods. Evidence from data indicates that the
confounding introduced by causal-effect covariability might be a real concern

storage costs and codes with low-density generator matrices (LDGM) are
preferred. Surprisingly, we show through both theoretical analysis and

traded off for benefits in design metrics such as design area, power
consumption or circuit complexity. In this work, we present a novel paradigm to
synthesize approximate circuits using Boolean matrix factorization (BMF). In
our methodology the truth table of a sub-circuit of the design is approximated
using BMF to a controllable approximation degree, and the results of the
factorization are used to synthesize a less complex subcircuit. To scale our
technique to large circuits, we devise a circuit decomposition method and a
subcircuit design-space exploration technique to identify the best order for
subcircuit approximations. Our method leads to a smooth trade-off between
accuracy and full circuit complexity as measured by design area and power
consumption. Using an industrial strength design flow, we extensively evaluate
our methodology on a number of testcases, where we demonstrate that the
proposed methodology can achieve up to 63% in power savings, while introducing
an average relative error of 5%. We also compare our work to previous works in
Boolean circuit synthesis and demonstrate significant improvements in design
metrics for same accuracy targets.

leads not only to the estimation of the game's value but also points to the

find the following. First, polarization is strongly path dependent and
sensitive to stochastic variation. Second, polarization depends strongly on the
initial distribution of opinions in the population. In the absence of
extremists, polarization may be mitigated. Third, noisy communication can drive
a population toward more extreme opinions and even cause acute polarization.
Finally, the apparent reduction in polarization under increased ""cultural

under which a population containing a wider diversity of extreme views is
deemed less polarized. This work has implications for understanding the
population dynamics of beliefs, opinions, and polarization, as well as broader

  28 pages, 7 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Our understanding of evolution is shaped strongly by how we conceive of its
fundamental causes. In the original Modern Synthesis, evolution was defined as
a process of shifting the frequencies of available alleles at many loci
affecting a trait under selection. Events of mutation that introduce novelty
were not considered evolutionary causes, but proximate causes acting at the
wrong level. Today it is clear that long-term evolutionary dynamics depend on
the dynamics of mutational introduction. Yet, the implications of this
dependency remain unfamiliar, and have not yet penetrated into high-level
debates over evolutionary theory. Modeling the influence of biases in the
introduction process reveals behavior previously unimagined, as well as
behavior previously considered impossible. Quantitative biases in the
introduction of variation can impose biases on the outcome of evolution without
requiring high mutation rates or neutral evolution. Mutation-biased adaptation,
a possibility not previously imagined, has been observed among diverse taxa.
Directional trends are possible under a sustained bias. Biases that are
developmental in origin may have an effect analogous to mutational biases.
Structuralist arguments invoking the relative accessibility of forms in
state-space can be understood as references to the role of biases in the
introduction of variation. That is, the characteristic concerns of molecular
evolution, evo-devo and structuralism can be interpreted to implicate a kind of
causation absent from the original Modern Synthesis.

surface dipolar magnetic fields that we believe are unphysical. Instead, we
propose quite the opposite scenario: some of these pulsars exhibit weak
magnetic fields, so much so that their magnetospheres are crushed by the weight
of inflowing matter. The enormous spinup rate is achieved before inflowing
matter reaches the pulsar's surface as the penetrating inner disk transfers its
excess angular momentum to the receding magnetosphere which, in turn, applies a
powerful spinup torque to the pulsar. This mechanism also works in reverse: it
spins a pulsar down when the magnetosphere expands beyond corotation and finds
itself rotating faster than the accretion disk which then exerts a powerful
retarding torque to the magnetic field and to the pulsar itself. The above
scenaria cannot be accommodated within the context of neutron-star accretion
processes occurring near spin equilibrium, thus they constitute a step toward a

four-momentum is better regarded as comprising momentum and \textit{inertia}

developed for the wind-fed source Cyg X-1. The hard and soft spectral states of
Cyg X-1 are interpreted in terms of co-spatial two component flows for the
innermost region of an accretion disk. The state transitions result from the
outward expansion and inward recession of this inner disk for the hard to soft
and soft to hard transition respectively. The theoretical framework for state
transitions in black hole X-ray binaries with high mass companions involving a
change in the inner disk size, thus, differs from systems with low mass
companions involving the change in the outer disk size. This fundamental
difference stems from the fact that matter captured and supplied to the black
hole in wind-fed systems has low specific angular momentum and is hot
essentially heated in the bow and spiral shocks, whereas it has high specific
angular momentum and is cool in Roche lobe overflow systems. The existence of a
weak cool disk around the ISCO region in the hard state allows for the presence
of a relativistically broadened Fe K line. The small disk fed by gas
condensation forms without an extensive outer disk, precluding thermal
instabilities and large outbursts, resulting in the lack of large amplitude
outbursts and hysteresis effects in the light curve of high mass black hole
X-ray binaries. Their relatively persistent X-ray emission is attributed to
their wind-fed nature.

determining flood risk and adequately designing infrastructure (e.g.,
stormwater pipes) to withstand such hazards. While environmental phenomena
typically exhibit weakening spatial dependence at increasingly extreme levels,
limiting max-stable process models for block maxima have a rigid dependence
structure that does not capture this type of behavior. We propose a flexible
Bayesian model from a broader family of (conditionally) max-infinitely
divisible processes that allows for weakening spatial dependence at
increasingly extreme levels, and due to a hierarchical representation of the
likelihood in terms of random effects, our inference approach scales to large
datasets. Therefore, our model not only has a flexible dependence structure,
but it also allows for fast, fully Bayesian inference, prediction and
conditional simulation in high dimensions. The proposed model is constructed
using flexible random basis functions that are estimated from the data,
allowing for straightforward inspection of the predominant spatial patterns of
extremes. In addition, the described process possesses (conditional)
max-stability as a special case, making inference on the tail dependence class
possible. We apply our model to extreme precipitation in North-Eastern America,

the data. Interestingly, we find that the principal modes of spatial variation
estimated from our model resemble observed patterns in extreme precipitation

  Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter-wave will be a key technology in next-generation wireless networks
thanks to abundant bandwidth availability. However, the use of large antenna
arrays with beamforming demands precise beam-alignment between transmitter and
receiver, and may entail huge overhead in mobile environments. This paper
investigates the design of an optimal interactive beam-alignment and data
communication protocol, with the goal of minimizing power consumption under a
minimum rate constraint. The base-station selects beam-alignment or data
communication and the beam parameters, based on feedback from the user-end.
Based on the sectored antenna model and uniform prior on the angles of
departure and arrival (AoD/AoA), the optimality of a fixed-length
beam-alignment phase followed by a data-communication phase is demonstrated.
Moreover, a decoupled fractional beam-alignment method is shown to be optimal,
which decouples over time the alignment of AoD and AoA, and iteratively scans a
fraction of their region of uncertainty. A heuristic policy is proposed for
non-uniform prior on AoD/AoA, with provable performance guarantees, and it is
shown that the uniform prior is the worst-case scenario. The performance
degradation due to detection errors is studied analytically and via simulation.
The numerical results with analog beams depict up to 4dB, 7.5dB, and 14 dB
gains over a state-of-the-art bisection method, conventional and interactive
exhaustive search policies, respectively, and demonstrate that the sectored
model provides valuable insights for beam-alignment design.

travel mode is a function of its level of service. An application of Bayesian
optimization (BO) to derive the optimal supply-side MoD parameters (e.g., fleet

the taxi demand data in Manhattan, New York. Travel demand is served by public
transit and MoD services of varying passenger capacities (1, 4 and 10), and
passengers are predicted to choose travel modes according to a mode choice
model. This choice model is estimated using stated preference data collected in
New York City. The convergence of the multimodal supply-demand system and the
superiority of the BO-based optimization method over earlier approaches are
established through numerical experiments. We finally consider a policy
intervention where the government imposes a tax on the ride-hailing service and
illustrate how the proposed framework can quantify the pros and cons of such

including sociology, biology, neuroscience and engineering. A task of major
practical importance in these application domains is inferring the network
structure from noisy observations at a subset of nodes. Available methods for
topology inference typically assume that the process over the network is
observed at all nodes. However, application-specific constraints may prevent
acquiring network-wide observations. Alleviating the limited flexibility of
existing approaches, this work advocates structural models for graph processes
and develops novel algorithms for joint inference of the network topology and
processes from partial nodal observations. Structural equation models (SEMs)
and structural vector autoregressive models (SVARMs) have well-documented
merits in identifying even directed topologies of complex graphs; while SEMs
capture contemporaneous causal dependencies among nodes, SVARMs further account
for time-lagged influences. This paper develops algorithms that iterate between
inferring directed graphs that ""best"" fit the data, and estimating the network
processes at reduced computational complexity by leveraging tools related to
Kalman smoothing. To further accommodate delay-sensitive applications, an
online joint inference approach is put forth that even tracks time-evolving
topologies. Furthermore, conditions for identifying the network topology given
partial observations are specified. It is proved that the required number of
observations for unique identification reduces significantly when the network
structure is sparse. Numerical tests with synthetic as well as real datasets
corroborate the effectiveness of the novel approach.

field of a large galaxy can torque its satellites such that the major axis of
satellite galaxies points towards their hosts. This so-called `shape alignment'
has been observed in isolated Milky Way-like galaxies but not in `Local
Group'-like pairs. In this study, we investigate the shape alignment of
satellite galaxies in galaxy pairs similar to the Local Group identified in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 13 (SDSS DR13). By stacking tens of
thousands of satellite galaxies around primary galaxy pairs, we find two
statistically strong alignment signals. (1) The major axes of satellite
galaxies located in the (projected) area between two primaries (the {\it
facing} region) tend to be perpendicular to the line connecting the satellite
to its host (tangential alignment), while (2) the major axes of satellite
galaxies located in regions away from the other host (the {\it away} region)
tend to be aligned with the line connecting the satellite to its host (radial
alignment). These alignments are confirmed at $\sim5\sigma$ levels. The
alignment signal increases with increasing primary brightness, decreasing pair
separation, and decreasing satellite distance. The alignment signal is also
found to be stronger in filamentary environments. These findings will shed
light on understanding the mechanisms of how satellite galaxies are affected by
the tidal field in galaxy pairs and will be useful for investigating galaxy
intrinsic alignment in the analyses of weak gravitational lensing.

hierarchical longitudinal and time-to-event data. Our motivating application
explores the association between tumor burden and progression-free survival in
non-small cell lung cancer patients. We define tumor burden as a function of
the sizes of target lesions clustered within a patient. Since a patient may
have more than one lesion, and each lesion is tracked over time, the data have
a three-level hierarchical structure: repeated measurements taken at time
points (level 1) clustered within lesions (level 2) within patients (level 3).
We jointly model the lesion-specific longitudinal trajectories and
patient-specific risk of death or disease progression by specifying novel
association structures that combine information across lower level clusters
(e.g. lesions) into patient-level summaries (e.g. tumor burden). We provide
user-friendly software for fitting the model under a Bayesian framework.
Lastly, we discuss alternative situations in which additional clustering
factor(s) occur at a level higher in the hierarchy than the patient-level,
since this has implications for the model formulation.

decomposes any signal into a few basic signals that possess positive

dummy-based algorithms have been developed to increase the anonymity of users,

result in huge scale changes of the object size. Earlier methods based on

challenging person re-identification task. One remarkable bottleneck is that
the existing deep models are data hungry and require large amounts of labeled
training data. Acquiring manual annotations for pedestrian identity matchings
in large-scale surveillance camera installations is a highly cumbersome task.
Here, we propose the first semi-supervised approach that performs
pseudo-labeling by considering complex relationships between unlabeled and
labeled training samples in the feature space. Our approach first approximates
the actual data manifold by learning a generative model via adversarial
training. Given the trained model, data augmentation can be performed by
generating new synthetic data samples which are unlabeled. An open research
problem is how to effectively use this additional data for improved feature
learning. To this end, this work proposes a novel Feature Affinity based
Pseudo-Labeling (FAPL) approach with two possible label encodings under a
unified setting. Our approach measures the affinity of unlabeled samples with
the underlying clusters of labeled data samples using the intermediate feature
representations from deep networks. FAPL trains with the joint supervision of
cross-entropy loss together with a center regularization term, which not only
ensures discriminative feature representation learning but also simultaneously
predicts pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. Our extensive experiments on two
standard large-scale datasets, Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID, demonstrate
significant performance boosts over closely related competitors and outperforms
state-of-the-art person re-identification techniques in most cases.

replace traditional loop filters show large gains but with problems for

different quantization parameter (QP), respectively. It is expensive for
hardware. Second, float points operation in CNN leads to inconsistency between
encoding and decoding across different platforms. Third, redundancy within CNN
model consumes precious computational resources.
  This paper proposes a CNN as the loop filter for intra frames and proposes a
scheme to solve the above problems. It aims to design a single CNN model with
low redundancy to adapt to decoded frames with different qualities and ensure
consistency. To adapt to reconstructions with different qualities, both
reconstruction and QP are taken as inputs. After training, the obtained model
is compressed to reduce redundancy. To ensure consistency, dynamic fixed points
(DFP) are adopted in testing CNN. Parameters in the compressed model are first
quantized to DFP and then used for inference of CNN. Outputs of each layer in
CNN are computed by DFP operations. Experimental results on JEM 7.0 report
3.14%, 5.21%, 6.28% BD-rate savings for luma and two chroma components with all

Unlike traditional agent-based models, our agent aggregates all traders in the

identified with a bounded-rational component of the market itself, providing a
particular implementation of an Invisible Hand market mechanism. In such

electronic and magnetic phases emerging from competing interactions involving
strong correlation, orbital hopping, tunnelling and lattice coupling phenomena.
Here, we propose a half-metal/insulator superlattice that intrinsically forms
spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) following a mechanism very
different from the widely reported 2DEG at the single perovskite polar
interfaces. From DFT$+U$ study on Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$/La$_2$CoMnO$_6$ (001)
superlattice, we find that a periodic quantum well is created along [001] which
breaks the three-fold $t_{2g}$ degeneracy to separate the doubly degenerate
$xz$ and $yz$ states from the planar $xy$ state. In the spin-down channel, the
dual effect of quantum confinement and strong correlation localizes the
degenerate states, whereas the dispersive $xy$ state forms the 2DEG which is
robust against perturbations to the superlattice symmetry. The spin-up channel
retains the bulk insulating. Both spin polarization and orbital polarization
make the superlattice ideal for spintronic and orbitronic applications. The
suggested 2DEG mechanism widens the scope of fabricating next generation of
oxide heterostructures.

disordered in sub-clump Oph-B1. The field geometry in Oph-B2 is more ordered,
with a tendency to be along the major axis of the clump, parallel to the
filamentary structure within which it lies. The degree of polarization
decreases systematically towards the dense core material in the two sub-clumps.
The field lines in the lower density material along the periphery are smoothly
joined to the large scale magnetic fields probed by NIR polarization

constitute a broad peak, including single and double escape peaks. Thus, by

expensive. We propose a fast algorithm to compute travel-time sensitivity

capabilities in close proximity within a sliced radio access network (RAN),
which supports both traditional communication and MEC services. Nevertheless,
the design of computation offloading policies for a virtual MEC system remains
challenging. Specifically, whether to execute a computation task at the mobile
device or to offload it for MEC server execution should adapt to the
time-varying network dynamics. In this paper, we consider MEC for a
representative mobile user in an ultra-dense sliced RAN, where multiple base
stations (BSs) are available to be selected for computation offloading. The
problem of solving an optimal computation offloading policy is modelled as a
Markov decision process, where our objective is to maximize the long-term
utility performance whereby an offloading decision is made based on the task
queue state, the energy queue state as well as the channel qualities between MU
and BSs. To break the curse of high dimensionality in state space, we first
propose a double deep Q-network (DQN) based strategic computation offloading
algorithm to learn the optimal policy without knowing a priori knowledge of
network dynamics. Then motivated by the additive structure of the utility
function, a Q-function decomposition technique is combined with the double DQN,
which leads to novel learning algorithm for the solving of stochastic
computation offloading. Numerical experiments show that our proposed learning
algorithms achieve a significant improvement in computation offloading
performance compared with the baseline policies.

of the Brownian particles in a viscous fluid have been reported which are
impossible for the uncoupled motions of the similar particles. However, it is
expected that those physics in a viscoelastic fluid is much more interesting
due to the presence of the additional frequency dependent elasticity of the
medium. Thus, a theory describing the equilibrium dynamics of two
hydrodynamically coupled Brownian harmonic oscillators in a viscoelastic
Maxwell fluid has been derived which appears with new and impressive aspects.
Initially, the response functions have been calculated and then the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem has been used to calculate the correlation
functions between the coloured noises present on the concerned particles placed
in a Maxwell fluid due to the thermal motions of the fluid molecules. These
correlation functions appear to be in a linear relationship with the
delta-correlated noises in a viscous fluid. Consequently, this reduces the
statistical description of a simple viscoelastic fluid to the statistical
representation for an extended dynamical system subjected to delta-correlated
random forces. Thereupon, the auto and cross-correlation functions in the time
domain and frequency domain and the mean-square displacement functions of the
particles have been calculated which are perfectly consistent with their
corresponding established forms in a viscous fluid and emerge with exceptional
characteristics.

to scientific applications given the data-driven discovery paradigm shift. As a
storage solution for large-scale HPC systems, dozens of applications share the
same storage system, and will compete and can interfere with each other.
Application interference can dramatically degrade the overall storage system
performance. Therefore, developing a flexible and effective storage solution to
assure a certain level of resources per application, i.e. the
Quality-of-Service (QoS) support, is critical. One of the common solution to
achieve QoS assurance for storage systems is using provisioning
technique~\cite{3}. Provisioning refers to the ability of providing certain
amount of resources for applications and expected workloads. However,
provisioning has limitations such as requiring the detailed knowledge of the
expected workloads. In addition, the storage workloads are transient hence
expensive to be satisfied. Due to these limitations, providing QoS storage
systems through provisioning is challenging.
  In this research, a software-defined approach~\cite{0} is proposed as a
flexible solution to achieve QoS guarantee for storage systems. The driving
force of using a software-defined approach instead of the traditional
approaches, is that it has the ability to enable a more flexible, scalable, and
efficient platform. For example, if any changes occurred in the system, it does
not necessarily need to re-configure thousands of devices; instead, with
re-configuring a logically centralized component, other devices will be
automatically notified.

(Ruuth and Merriman, J. Comput. Phys. 227(3):1943-1961, [2008]) is an embedding
method for solving PDEs on surfaces using standard finite difference schemes.
In this paper, we formulate an explicit closest point method using finite
difference schemes derived from radial basis functions (RBF- FD). Unlike the
orthogonal gradients method (Piret, J. Comput. Phys. 231(14):4662-4675,

formulation not only reduces the computational cost but also avoids the
ill-conditioning from point clustering on the surface and is more natural to
couple with a grid based manifold evolution algorithm (Leung and Zhao, J.
Comput. Phys. 228(8):2993-3024, [2009]). When compared to the standard finite
difference discretization of the closest point method, the proposed method
requires a smaller computational domain surrounding the surface, resulting in a
decrease in the number of sampling points on the surface. In addition,
higher-order schemes can easily be constructed by increasing the number of
points in the RBF-FD stencil. Applications to a variety of examples are
provided to illustrate the numerical convergence of the method.

execution) need to be transferred back and forth between compute nodes and
storage systems, which introduces a significant performance bottleneck on I/O
operations. Along with the enlarging perfor-mance gap between CPU and storage
devices, this bottleneck is expected to be worse.
  Recently, we have introduced a new concept of Compute-on-Data-Path to allow
tasks and data binding to be more efficient to reduce the data movement cost.
To workflow systems, the key is to exploit the data locality in HPC storage
hierarchy: if the datasets are stored in compute nodes, near the workflow
tasks, then the task can directly access them with better performance with less
network usage. Several recent studies have been done regarding building such a
shared storage system, utilizing compute node resources, to serve HPC workflows
with locality, such as Hercules [1] and WOSS [2] etc. In this research, we
further argue that providing a compute-node side storage system is not
sufficient to fully exploit data locality. A cross-layer solution combining
storage system, compiler, and runtime is necessary. We take Swift/T [3], a
workflow system for data-intensive applications, as a prototype platform to
demonstrate such a cross-layer solution

petabytes of information in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments. Data
management environments must meet the performance needs of such applications,
represented by various Quality-of-Service (QoS) metrics such as desired
bandwidth, response time guarantee, and resource utilization. Traditional
high-performance management platforms are facing considerable challenges
regarding flexibility, as well as the need to address a variety of QoS metrics

considered promising, and various prototypes have already been deployed in
Cloud-based data centers. In this paper, we investigate the idea of utilizing a
software-defined approach to provide I/O QoS provisioning for HPC applications.
We identify the key challenges towards the high degree of concurrency and
variation in HPC platforms, and propose a series of novel designs into the
general software-defined approach in order to deliver our goal. Specifically,
we introduced a borrowing-based strategy and a new M-LWDF algorithm based on
traditional token-bucket algorithms to assure a fair and efficient utilization
of resources for HPC applications. Due to the lack of software-defined
frameworks in current HPC platform, we evaluated our framework through
simulation. The experimental results show that our strategies make a
significant improvement upon the general HPC frameworks and lead to clear

embedded information provides proof of authorship and facilitates tracking

proposed to preserve inserted copyright information from various attacks, such
as content modification and watermark removal attack. However, since the
watermark is inserted in the form of noise, there is an inevitable effect of
reducing content visual quality. In general, more robust watermarking
techniques tend to have larger effect on the quality, and content creators and
users are often reluctant to insert watermarks. Thus, there is a demand for a
watermark that maintains maximum image quality, even if the watermark
performance is slightly inferior. Therefore, we propose a watermarking
technique that maximizes invisibility while maintaining sufficient robustness
and data capacity enough to be applied for real situations. The proposed method
minimizes watermarking energy by adopting curvelet domain multi-directional
decomposition to maximize invisibility, and maximizes robustness against signal
processing attack by watermarking pattern suitable for curvelet transformation.
The method is also robust against geometric attack by employing watermark
detection method utilizing curvelet characteristics. The proposed method showed
very good results of 57.65 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio in fidelity tests, and
mean opinion score showed that images treated with the proposed method were
hardly distinguishable from the originals. The proposed technique also showed

contrast-mechanism to (propagation-based) X-ray phase contrast imaging (XPCI),
an emerging lensless technique that enables 2D- and 3D-imaging of biological
soft tissues and other light-element samples down to nanometer-resolutions.
Mathematically, propagation is described by the Fresnel-propagator, a
convolution with an arbitrarily non-local kernel. As real-world detectors may
only capture a finite field-of-view, this non-locality implies that the
recorded diffraction-patterns are necessarily incomplete. This raises the
question of stability of image-reconstruction from the truncated data -- even
if the complex-valued wave-field, and not just its modulus, could be measured.
Contrary to the latter restriction of the acquisition, known as the
phase-problem, the finite-detector-problem has not received much attention in
literature. The present work therefore analyzes locality of Fresnel-propagation
in order to establish stability of XPCI with finite detectors.
Image-reconstruction is shown to be severely ill-posed in this setting -- even
without a phase-problem. However, quantitative estimates of the leaked
wave-field reveal that Lipschitz-stability holds down to a sharp resolution
limit that depends on the detector-size and varies within the field-of-view.
The smallest resolvable lengthscale is found to be 1/F times the detector's
aspect length, where F is the Fresnel number associated with the latter scale.
The stability results are extended to phaseless imaging in the linear
contrast-transfer-function regime.

obtained graph series. We address the fundamental question of knowing whether a
series of graphs formed using a given $\Delta$ faithfully describes the
original link stream. We answer the question by showing that such dynamic
networks exhibit a threshold for $\Delta$, which we call the \emph{saturation
scale}, beyond which the properties of propagation of the link stream are
altered, while they are mostly preserved before. We design an automatic method
to determine the saturation scale of any link stream, which we apply and
validate on several real-world datasets.

is the externality effect among agents. For a resource allocation problem,
externalities imply that a bundle allocated to an agent may affect the
utilities of other agents.
  In this paper, we conduct a study of fair allocation of indivisible goods
when the externalities are not negligible. We present a simple and natural
model, namely \emph{network externalities}, to capture the externalities. To
evaluate fairness in the network externalities model, we generalize the idea
behind the notion of maximin-share ($\MMS$) to achieve a new criterion, namely,
\emph{extended-maximin-share} ($\EMMS$). Next, we consider two problems
concerning our model.
  First, we discuss the computational aspects of finding the value of $\EMMS$
for every agent. For this, we introduce a generalized form of partitioning
problem that includes many famous partitioning problems such as maximin,
minimax, and leximin partitioning problems. We show that a $1/2$-approximation
algorithm exists for this partitioning problem.
  Next, we investigate on finding approximately optimal $\EMMS$ allocations.
That is, allocations that guarantee every agent a utility of at least a
fraction of his extended-maximin-share. We show that under a natural assumption
that the agents are $\alpha$-self-reliant, an $\alpha/2$-$\EMMS$ allocation
always exists. The combination of this with the former result yields a
polynomial-time $\alpha/4$-$\EMMS$ allocation algorithm.

provides comprehensive information about the system in question. For complex
many-body problems, such an approach usually requires the formulation of proper
classical-like approximations, which is particularly challenging if multiple
electronic states are involved. In this manuscript, we express the
imaginary-time shifted time correlation function (TCF) and, thus, the vibronic
spectrum in terms of the so-called Matsubara dynamics, which combines quantum
statistics and classical-like dynamics. In contrast to the existing literature,
we invoke a local harmonic approximation to the potential allowing an
analytical evaluation of integrals. By subsequently applying the Matsubara
approximation, we derive a generalization of the existing Matsubara method to
multiple potential energy surfaces (PESs), which, however, suffers from the
sign problem as its single-PES counterpart does. The mathematical analysis for
two shifted harmonic oscillators suggests a new modified method to simulate the
standard correlation function via classical-like dynamics. Importantly, this
modified method samples the thermal Wigner function without suffering from the
sign problem and it yields an accurate approximation to the vibronic absorption
spectrum, not only for the harmonic system, but also for an anharmonic one.

semantics is formally defined both declaratively as an acyclicity axiom, and
operationally as a concurrent algorithm with memory bearing timestamps.
  We develop two simpler equivalent operational definitions of SI as lock-based
reference implementations that do not use timestamps. Our first locking
implementation is prescient in that requires a priori knowledge of the data
accessed by a transaction and carries out transactional writes eagerly
(in-place). Our second implementation is non-prescient and performs
transactional writes lazily by recording them in a local log and propagating
them to memory at commit time. Whilst our first implementation is simpler and
may be better suited for developing a program logic for SI transactions, our
second implementation is more practical due to its non-prescience. We show that
both implementations are sound and complete against the declarative SI
specification and thus yield equivalent operational definitions for SI.
  We further consider, for the first time formally, the use of SI in a context
with racy non-transactional accesses, as can arise in STM implementations of
SI. We introduce robust snapshot isolation (RSI), an adaptation of SI with
similar semantics and guarantees in this mixed setting. We present a

network-based template architecture that compensates for the disadvantages of
existing watermarking techniques that are vulnerable to geometric distortion.
The proposed template consists of a template generation network, a template
extraction network, and a template matching network. The template generation
network generates a template in the form of noise and the template is inserted
into certain pre-defined spatial locations of the image. The extraction network
detects spatial locations where the template is inserted in the image. Finally,
the template matching network estimates the parameters of the geometric
distortion by comparing the shape of spatial locations where the template was
inserted with the locations where the template was detected. It is possible to
recover an image in its original geometrical form using the estimated
parameters, and as a result, watermarks applied using existing watermarking
techniques that are vulnerable to geometric distortion can be decoded normally.

composed of compliant and soft materials. It allows the body to bend, twist,
and deform to move or to adapt its shape to the environment for grasping, all
of which are difficult for traditional hard robots with rigid bodies. However,
the theoretical basis and design principles for soft robotics are not
well-founded despite their recognized importance. For example, the control of
soft robots is outsourced to morphological attributes and natural processes;
thus, the coupled relations between a robot and its environment are
particularly crucial. In this paper, we propose a mathematical foundation for
soft robotics based on category theory, which is a branch of abstract math
where any notions can be described by objects and arrows. It allows for a
rigorous description of the inherent characteristics of soft robots and their
relation to the environment as well as the differences compared to conventional
hard robots. We present a notion called the category of mobility that well
describes the subject matter. The theory was applied to a model system and
analysis to highlight the adaptation behavior observed in universal grippers,
which are a typical example of soft robotics. This paper paves the way to
developing a theoretical background and design principles for soft robotics.

the simple-transmission approximation to compare cellular and nuclear RI by

contagion processes, embedded both in networked and spatial contexts. Here we
investigate the pattern dynamics of a complex contagion, where two agents, say
$A$ and $B$, interact with each other and diffuse simultaneously in the
geographic space. The contagion process for each follows the classical
susceptible-infected-susceptible kinetics, and their interaction introduces a
potential change in the secondary infection propensity compared to the baseline
reproduction ratio $R_0$. We show that nontrivial spatial infection patterns
arise, when the susceptible move faster than the infected and the interaction
between the two agents is neither too competitive nor too cooperative.
Interestingly, the system exhibits pattern hysteresis phenomena that quite
different parameter regions allowing for patterns exist in the direction of
increasing $R_0$ and in the direction of eradication by its reduction. The
latter shows a remarkable enhancement in the contagion prevalence, meaning that
the infection eradication now becomes extremely difficult compared to the
single-agent scenario and to the coinfection without space. Linearization
analysis supports our observations, and we identified the required elements and
dynamical mechanism behind the emergence of a pattern. These findings call for
further investigation for their close relevance, both in biological and social

of two-coupled generalized nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equations (GNLSE),
validating the usual approximation made to compute the cross nonlinear

silicon wire waveguides and contrary to optical fibers, the dispersion of the

be used to characterize the disk-jet connection. However, evidence of such link
have been scarce and indirect. Mrk 421 is a BL Lac object which has a prominent
jet pointed towards us and a weak disk emission, and it is assumed that most of

dielectric, the other purely magnetic, has been calculated long ago by Boyer
[T. H. Boyer, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 9}, 2078 (1974)]. Its most characteristic
property is that it is repulsive. The problem is actually delicate and
counterintuitive, since it implies, for instance, that in the boundary layer of
the electric plate the square $E^2$ of the electric field becomes a negative
quantity. In the present paper we analyze the problem by first considering the

understood on a microscopic basis, due to the duality between canonical and
mechanical momenta in presence of the electromagnetic vector potential. This
duality corresponds to the TM and TE modes in electrodynamics. We analyze the
generalized Boyer case where the permittivities and permeabilities of the
parallel plates are arbitrary. In this respect we first find the induced
interaction between a pair of particles with given electric and magnetic
polarizabilities and then find it for a pair of parallel plates. The method
used for our evaluations is the statistical mechanical one that we have

$t_p$ nodes in a passive fashion and at most $t_f$ nodes in a fail-stop

transmission protocols called the quiescent protocols. Quiescent protocols
ensure that the players eventually stop sending messages but in contrast to the
usual terminating protocols, these protocols do not require the players to go
into the halt state, from which they cannot take any further action. To show
the significance of quiescent protocols, we first identify conditions in which
it is impossible for any terminating protocol to achieve PSMT. To circumvent
this impossibility, we transform the existing synchronous PSMT protocol into a
quiescent protocol which accomplishes PSMT. By focusing on designing quiescent
protocols rather than terminating protocols, we show that asynchrony in the
network does not demand any extra connectivity over its state-of-the-art
synchronous counterpart. This shows that quiescent protocols are befitted to
solve PSMT in asynchronous networks with fail-stop faults.

relativistic treatment. It will be shown that previous analyses missed an
important effect of clock synchronization. By adding this new effect, the
correct general relativistic prevision is in perfect agreement with the new
experimental results. Such an effect of clock synchronization has been missed
in various papers in the literature, with some subsequent claim of invalidity
of the relativity theory and/or some attempts to explain the experimental
results through ""exotic"" effects. The general relativistic interpretation in
this Essay shows, instead, that the new experimental results of the Mossbauer
rotor experiment are a new, strong and independent, proof of general
relativity.

directed graphs. Acting as synchronous distributed algorithms, they use their
input graph as a network in which identical processors communicate for a
possibly infinite number of synchronous rounds. For the local variant of those
automata, where the number of rounds is bounded by a constant, Hella et al.
(2012, 2015) have established a logical characterization in terms of basic
modal logic. In this thesis, we provide similar logical characterizations for
two more expressive classes of distributed automata.
  The first class extends local automata with a global acceptance condition and
the ability to alternate between nondeterministic and parallel computations. We
show that it is equivalent to monadic second-order logic on graphs. By
restricting transitions to be nondeterministic or deterministic, we also obtain
two strictly weaker variants for which the emptiness problem is decidable.
  Our second class transfers the standard notion of asynchronous algorithm to
the setting of nonlocal distributed automata. The resulting machines are shown
to be equivalent to a small fragment of least fixpoint logic, and more
specifically, to a restricted variant of the modal {\mu}-calculus that allows
least fixpoints but forbids greatest fixpoints. Exploiting the connection with
logic, we additionally prove that the expressive power of those asynchronous

The nature of the phase transition dictates the nature of the inhomogeneities
formed. Recently some scenarios of inhomogeneities have been discussed where
the strange quarks are in excess over the up and down quarks. The hadronization
of these quarks will give rise to a large density of hyperons and kaons in
addition to the protons and neutrons which are formed after the phase
transition. These unstable hyperons decay into pions, muons and their
respective neutrinos. Hence the plasma during this period consists of neutrons,
protons, electrons, muons and neutrinos. Due to the decay of the hyperons, the
muon component of the inhomogeneities will be very high. We study the diffusion
of neutrons and protons in the presence of a large number of muons immediately
after the quark hadron phase transition. We find that the presence of the muons
enhances the diffusion coefficient of the neutrons/protons. As the diffusion
coefficient is enhanced, the inhomogeneities will decay faster in the regions
where the muon density is higher. Hence smaller muon rich inhomogeneities will
be completely wiped out. The decay of the hyperons will also generate muon
neutrinos. Since the big bang nucleosynthesis provides constraints on the
neutrino degeneracies, we revisit the effect of non zero degeneracies on the
primordial elements.

scales with the bandgap and vanishes for zero bandgap, shedding new light on

probability distribution function of the number of these alternations is
derived for circular or periodic DNA. Since there are several symmetries to
account for in the periodic chain, necklace counting methods are used. In
particular, Polya's Enumeration Theorem is extended for the case of a group
action that preserves partitioned necklaces. This, along with the treatment of
generating functions as formal power series, allows for the direct calculation
of the number of possible necklaces with a given number of AT base pairs, GC
base pairs and alternations. The theoretically obtained probability
distribution functions of the number of alternations are accurately reproduced
by Monte Carlo simulations and fitted by Gaussians. The effect of the number of
base pairs on the characteristics of these distributions is also discussed, as
well as the effect of the ratios of the numbers of AT and GC base pairs.

derives adequate knowledge from previous actions improving the quality of

maximum power and for the large frequency separation have caught the attention
of various fields of astrophysics. With the exquisite photometry of
\textit{Kepler}, the uncertainties in the seismic observables are small enough
to estimate masses and radii with a precision of only a few per cent. Even
though this seems to work quite well for main-sequence stars, there is
empirical evidence, mainly from studies of eclipsing binary systems, that the
seismic scaling relations overestimate the mass and radius of red giants by
about 15 and 5\%, respectively. Model-based corrections of the $\Delta\nu
-$scaling reduce the problem but do not solve it. We re-examine the global
oscillation parameters of the giants in the binary systems in order to
determine their seismic fundamental parameters and find them to agree with the
dynamic parameters from the literature if we adopt nonlinear scalings. We note
that a curvature and glitch corrected $\Delta\nu_\mathrm{cor}$ should be
preferred over a local or average values. We then compare the observed seismic
parameters of the cluster giants to those scaled from independent measurements
and find the same nonlinear behaviour as for the eclipsing binaries. Our final
proposed scaling relations are based on both samples and cover a broad range of

population. This suggests that the Mg ii emission region in these objects is
not of a thin disk geometry, however the average equivalent width of the line
negates a spherical alternative. A positive correlation between Mg ii
equivalent width and inclination cannot be ruled out, meaning there is no
strong evidence that Mg ii emission is anisotropic. Since thin disk emission
would be highly directional, the geometric implications of these two findings
are compatible. The lack of line width correlation with inclination may also
indicate that Mg ii is useful for estimating black hole masses in
lobe-dominated quasar samples, since it is unbiased by orientation. Some
quasars in our sample have almost edge-on viewing angles and therefore cannot
have a smooth toroidal obscurer co-planar with the accretion disk. Alternatives
may be a distorted dusty disk or a clumpy obscurer. This could result from the
sample selection bias towards high inclination objects, rather than intrinsic
differences between lobe-dominated and typical quasars. Five objects have

back to an ergonomic optimum. Effectively, the new protocol optimises the
human-robot relative position and orientation as a function of human
ergonomics. An RGB-D camera is used to calculate and monitor human joint angles
in real-time and to determine the current ergonomics state. A total of 6 main
causes of low ergonomic states are identified, leading to 6 universal robot
responses to allow the human to return to an optimal ergonomics state. The
algorithmic framework identifies these 6 causes and controls the cooperating
robot to always adapt the environment (e.g. change the pose of the workpiece)
in a way that is ergonomically most comfortable for the interacting user.
Hence, human-robot interaction is continuously re-evaluated optimizing
ergonomics states. The approach is validated through an experimental study,
based on established ergonomic methods and their adaptation for real-time

finite abstractions (a.k.a. symbolic models) of interconnected discrete-time
control systems. The compositional scheme is based on small-gain type
reasoning. In particular, we use a notion of so-called alternating simulation
functions as a relation between each subsystem and its symbolic model. Assuming
some small-gain type conditions, we construct compositionally an overall
alternating simulation function as a relation between an interconnection of
symbolic models and that of original control subsystems. In such
compositionality reasoning, the gains associated with the alternating
simulation functions of the subsystems satisfy a certain ""small-gain""
condition. In addition, we introduce a technique to construct symbolic models
together with their corresponding alternating simulation functions for
discrete-time control subsystems under some stability property. Finally, we
apply our results to the temperature regulation in a circular building by
constructing compositionally a finite abstraction of a network containing $N$
rooms for any $N\geq3$. We use the constructed symbolic models as substitutes
to synthesize controllers compositionally maintaining room temperatures in a
comfort zone. We choose $N=1000$ for the sake of illustrating the results. We
also apply our proposed techniques to a nonlinear example of fully connected
network in which the compositionality condition still holds for any number of
components. In these case studies, we show the effectiveness of the proposed
results in comparison with the existing compositionality technique in the
literature using a dissipativity-type reasoning.

  Excess, and Loop I",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gamma ray observations have found evidence of an extremely energetic outflow
emanating from the Galactic Centre, and an `excess' of emission at GeV energies
towards the Galactic Centre over that expected from current models. Determining
whether the outflow is AGN- or star formation-driven, and whether the `excess'
is astrophysical in origin or requires new physics (e.g. self-annihilation of
dark matter), requires the accurate modelling of the expected energy injection
from astrophysical sources and the subsequent interaction with the surrounding
environment. We briefly summarise current constraints on the distribution of
gas and young stars in the inner few hundred parsec of the Galaxy that can be
included in future 2D and 3D modelling of the astrophysical gamma ray emission.
The key points to highlight with respect to predominantly axisymmetric models
currently in use are: (i) the distribution of dense gas, young stars and
interstellar radiation field is highly asymmetric around the Galactic Centre;
(ii) star formation is almost exclusively constrained to a Galactocentric
radius of ~100pc; (iii) the star formation rate in this region has been
constant at <0.1Msun/yr to within a factor of 2 over the last ~5 Myr.

near-field cosmology thanks to their high luminosities, pulsations, and that
they follow the Leavitt (Period-Luminosity) Law. However, there still exist a
number of questions regarding their evolution, such as the role of rotation,
convective core overshooting and winds. ln particular, how do these processes
impact Cepheid evolution and the predicted fundamental properties such as
stellar mass. In this work, we compare a sample of period change that are
real-time observations of stellar evolution with new evolution models to test
the impact of these first two processes. In our previous study we found that
enhanced mass loss is crucial for describing the sample, and here we continue
that analysis but for rotational mixing and core overshooting. We show that,
while rotation is important for stellar evolution studies, rotation, itself, is
insufficient to model the distribution of period change rates from the observed
sample. On the other hand, convective core overshooting is needed to explain
the magnitude of the rates of period change, but does not explain the number of
stars with positive and negative period change rates. In conclusion, we
determine that convective core overshooting and stellar rotation alone are not
enough to account for the observed distribution of Cepheid rates of period
change and another mechanism, such as pulsation-driven mass-loss, may be
required.

complicates learning and inference in practical applications. A common approach
is to use embedding techniques to represent graphs as points in a conventional
Euclidean space, but non-Euclidean spaces have often been shown to be better
suited for embedding graphs. Among these, constant-curvature Riemannian
manifolds (CCMs) offer embedding spaces suitable for studying the statistical
properties of a graph distribution, as they provide ways to easily compute
metric geodesic distances. In this paper, we focus on the problem of detecting
changes in stationarity in a stream of attributed graphs. To this end, we
introduce a novel change detection framework based on neural networks and CCMs,
that takes into account the non-Euclidean nature of graphs. Our contribution in
this work is twofold. First, via a novel approach based on adversarial
learning, we compute graph embeddings by training an autoencoder to represent
graphs on CCMs. Second, we introduce two novel change detection tests operating
on CCMs. We perform experiments on synthetic data, as well as two real-world
application scenarios: the detection of epileptic seizures using functional
connectivity brain networks, and the detection of hostility between two
subjects, using human skeletal graphs. Results show that the proposed methods
are able to detect even small changes in a graph-generating process,
consistently outperforming approaches based on Euclidean embeddings.

whether the spinor representation carries a quaternionic or para-quaternionic

studying the native structure and organization of macromolecules inside single
cells. For systematic recognition and recovery of macromolecular structures
captured by CECT, methods for several important tasks such as subtomogram
classification and semantic segmentation have been developed. However, the
recognition and recovery of macromolecular structures are still very difficult
due to high molecular structural diversity, crowding molecular environment, and
the imaging limitations of CECT. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task
3D convolutional neural network model for simultaneous classification,
segmentation, and coarse structural recovery of macromolecules of interest in
subtomograms. In our model, the learned image features of one task are shared
and thereby mutually reinforce the learning of other tasks. Evaluated on
realistically simulated and experimental CECT data, our multi-task learning
model outperformed all single-task learning methods for classification and
segmentation. In addition, we demonstrate that our model can generalize to
discover, segment and recover novel structures that do not exist in the

varying the speed at which the atoms are transported or adjusting the depth of
the transport potential according to the atomic position. We characterize the
transport of atoms to the fiber tip for these different parameters. In
particular, we show that by adapting the transport potential we can lower the
temperature of the transported atoms by a factor of 6, while reducing the
transport efficiency only by a factor 2. For atoms transported inside the
fiber, we can obtain a transport efficiency into the fiber of more than 40% and
we study the influence of the different transport parameters on the
time-dependent optical depth signal. When comparing our measurements to the
results of a classical transport simulation, we find a good qualitative

vision-based road scene understanding (RSU) as an exemplary application. Since
multi-task learning requires specialized datasets, particularly when using
extensive sets of tasks, we provide a multi-modal dataset for multi-task RSU,

higher quality videos has put a significant load on content delivery networks
in the recent years. Due to the relatively limited delivery infrastructure, the
video users in HTTP streaming often encounter dynamically varying quality over
time due to rate adaptation, while the delays in video packet arrivals result
in rebuffering events. The user quality-of-experience (QoE) degrades and varies
with time because of these factors. Thus, it is imperative to monitor the QoE
continuously in order to minimize these degradations and deliver an optimized
QoE to the users. Towards this end, we propose a nonlinear state space model
for efficiently and effectively predicting the user QoE on a continuous time
basis. The QoE prediction using the proposed approach relies on a state space
that is defined by a set of carefully chosen time varying QoE determining
features. An evaluation of the proposed approach conducted on two publicly
available continuous QoE databases shows a superior QoE prediction performance
over the state-of-the-art QoE modeling approaches. The evaluation results also
demonstrate the efficacy of the selected features and the model order employed
for predicting the QoE. Finally, we show that the proposed model is completely
state controllable and observable, so that the potential of state space
modeling approaches can be exploited for further improving QoE prediction.

been considerable research surrounding Moore's Law and the generalized versions
applied to the time dependence of performance for other technologies. The prior
work has culminated with methodology for quantitative estimation of
technological improvement rates for nearly any technology. This paper examines
the implications of such regular time dependence for performance upon the
timing of key events in the technological adoption process. We propose a simple
crossover point in performance which is based upon the technological
improvement rates and current level differences for target and replacement
technologies. The timing for the cross-over is hypothesized as corresponding to
the first 'knee'? in the technology adoption ""S-curve"" and signals when the
market for a given technology will start to be rewarding for innovators. This
is also when potential entrants are likely to intensely experiment with
product-market fit and when the competition to achieve a dominant design
begins. This conceptual framework is then back-tested by examining two
technological changes brought about by the internet, namely music and video
transmission. The uncertainty analysis around the cases highlight opportunities
for organizations to reduce future technological uncertainty. Overall, the
results from the case studies support the reliability and utility of the
conceptual framework in strategic business decision-making with the caveat that
while technical uncertainty is reduced, it is not eliminated.

theories, but this is not the only possibility. Here we consider relativistic
quantum theories with a fixed number of particles that interact neither through
potentials nor through exchange of bosons. Instead, the interaction can occur
directly along light cones, in a way similar to the Wheeler-Feynman formulation
of classical electrodynamics. For two particles, the wave function is here of
the form $\psi(x_1,x_2)$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are spacetime points.
Specifically, we consider a natural class of covariant equations governing the
time evolution of $\psi$ involving integration over light cones, or even more
general spacetime regions. It is not obvious, however, whether these equations
possess a unique solution for every initial datum. We prove for
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes (certain cosmological curved
spacetimes with a Big Bang singularity, i.e., with a beginning in time) that in
the case of purely retarded interactions there does, in fact, exist a unique
solution for every datum on the initial hypersurface. The proof is based on
carrying over similar results for a Minkowski half-space (i.e., the future of a
spacelike hyperplane) to curved spacetime. Furthermore, we show that also in
the case of time-symmetric interactions and for spacetimes with both a Big Bang
and a Big Crunch solutions do exist. However, initial data are then not
appropriate anymore; the solution space gets parametrized in a different way.

prognosis, and longitudinal monitoring in MS. Automating this operation
eliminates inter-rater variability and increases the efficiency of
large-throughput analysis pipelines. Robust and reliable segmentation across
multi-site spinal cord data is challenging because of the large variability
related to acquisition parameters and image artifacts. The goal of this study
was to develop a fully-automatic framework, robust to variability in both image
parameters and clinical condition, for segmentation of the spinal cord and
intramedullary MS lesions from conventional MRI data. Scans of 1,042 subjects
(459 healthy controls, 471 MS patients, and 112 with other spinal pathologies)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To deal with the very small proportion of

CNN with 2D dilated convolutions detects the spinal cord centerline, followed
by a second CNN with 3D convolutions that segments the spinal cord and/or

designing or learning new modulation schemes has focused on using highly
simplified analytic channel models such as additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN), Rayleigh fading channels or similar. Recently, we proposed the usage of
a generative adversarial networks (GANs) to jointly approximate a wireless
channel response model (e.g. from real black box measurements) and optimize for
an efficient modulation scheme over it using machine learning. This approach
worked to some degree, but was unable to produce accurate probability
distribution functions (PDFs) representing the stochastic channel response. In
this paper, we focus specifically on the problem of accurately learning a
channel PDF using a variational GAN, introducing an architecture and loss
function which can accurately capture stochastic behavior. We illustrate where
our prior method failed and share results capturing the performance of such as
system over a range of realistic channel distributions.

implemented in an ensemble of percolating center vortices in four dimensions by
proposing a measure to compute center-element averages. The introduction of
phenomenological information such as monopole tension, stiffness, and fusion
leads to an effective YMH model with adjoint Higgs fields. If monopoles also
condense, then the gauge group undergoes ${\rm SU}(N) \to {\rm Z}(N)$ SSB. This

comparison is made between a high-quality, conventionally processed (CP) cavity
with a high field Q drop for acceleration field E $>$ 20 MV/m and a nitrogen
doped (N-doped) cavity that exhibits an increasing Q up to fields approaching
15 MV/m. The CP cavity displays hot spot regions at high RF fields where Q-drop
occurs as well as unaffected regions (cold spots). PCT data on cold spots
reveals a near ideal BCS density of states (DOS) with gap parameters, $\Delta$
as high as 1.62 meV, that are among the highest values ever reported for Nb.
Hot spot regions exhibit a wide distribution of gap values down to $\Delta
\sim$ 1.0 meV and DOS broadening characterized by a relatively large value of
pair-breaking rate, $\Gamma$, indicating surface regions of significantly
reduced superconductivity. In addition, hot spots commonly exhibit Kondo
tunneling peaks indicative of surface magnetic moments attributed to a
defective oxide. N-doped cavities reveal a more homoegeneous gap distribution
centered at $\Delta \sim$ 1.5 meV and relatively small values of
$\Gamma/\Delta$. The absence of regions of significantly reduced
superconductivity indicates that the N interstitials are playing an important
role in preventing the formation of hydride phases and other macroscopic
defects which might otherwise severely affect the local, surface
superconductivity that lead to hot spot formation. The N-doped cavities also
display a significantly improved surface oxide, i.e., increased thickness and
tunnel barrier height, compared to CP cavities. These results help explain the
improved performance of N-doped cavities and give insights into the origin of
the initial increasing Q with RF amplitude.

from data streams with a massive amount of data. Many algorithms have been
proposed to handle these difficulties, among them, the Very Fast Decision Tree
(VFDT) algorithm. Although the VFDT has been widely used in data stream mining,
in the last years, several authors have suggested modifications to increase its
performance, putting aside memory concerns by proposing memory-costly
solutions. Besides, most data stream mining solutions have been centred around
ensembles, which combine the memory costs of their weak learners, usually
VFDTs. To reduce the memory cost, keeping the predictive performance, this
study proposes the Strict VFDT (SVFDT), a novel algorithm based on the VFDT.
The SVFDT algorithm minimises unnecessary tree growth, substantially reducing
memory usage and keeping competitive predictive performance. Moreover, since it
creates much more shallow trees than VFDT, SVFDT can achieve a shorter
processing time. Experiments were carried out comparing the SVFDT with the VFDT
in 11 benchmark data stream datasets. This comparison assessed the trade-off
between accuracy, memory, and processing time. Statistical analysis showed that
the proposed algorithm obtained similar predictive performance and
significantly reduced processing time and memory use. Thus, SVFDT is a suitable
option for data stream mining with memory and time limitations, recommended as
a weak learner in ensemble-based solutions.

state-of-the-art video recognition framework is based on two-stream networks.
In such framework, besides the regular ConvNets responsible for RGB frame

usually the optical flow (OF). However, OF or other task-oriented flow is
computationally costly, and is thus typically pre-computed. Critically, this
prevents the two-stream approach from being applied to reinforcement learning
(RL) applications such as video game playing, where the next state depends on
current state and action choices. Inspired by the early vision systems of
mammals and insects, we propose a fast event-driven representation (EDR) that
models several major properties of early retinal circuits: (1) logarithmic
input response, (2) multi-timescale temporal smoothing to filter noise, and (3)
bipolar (ON/OFF) pathways for primitive event detection[12]. Trading off the
directional information for fast speed (> 9000 fps), EDR en-ables fast
real-time inference/learning in video applications that require interaction
between an agent and the world such as game-playing, virtual robotics, and
domain adaptation. In this vein, we use EDR to demonstrate performance
improvements over state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms for Atari

with UCF-101 video action recognition experiments, we show that EDR performs
near state-of-the-art in accuracy while achieving a 1,500x speedup in input

Shanghai, there is also a corresponding increase in traffic demand along these
arterials. With a preference toward increased accessibility and efficiency,
these arterials have been installed with an increased number of signalized
intersections and accesses to serve local traffic needs. The absence of a
defined functional hierarchy along the road network, together with the
non-uniform installation of signals and accesses tends to deteriorate arterial
safety. Previous studies on arterial safety have generally been based on a
single type of road entity (either intersection or roadway segment). These
studies only analyzed partial safety impacts of signal spacing and access
density, as these factors would significantly influence the safety performance
of both intersections and roadway segments. Macro level safety modeling was
usually applied to investigate the relationship between the zonal crash
frequencies and demographics, road network features and traffic
characteristics. In this study, a new modeling strategy was proposed to analyze
the safety impacts of roadway network features (i.e., road network patterns,
signal spacing and access density) of arterials by applying a macro level
safety modeling technique. Bayesian Conditional Autoregressive models were
developed for arterials covering 173 Traffic Analysis Zones in the suburban
area in Shanghai. The results identified that the road network pattern with
collector roads parallel to the arterials was shown to be associated with fewer
crashes than those without parallel collectors. Higher signal density and
access density also tended to increase crash frequencies on arterials.

elapsed since the generation of the last received information update. We
consider the problem of AoI minimization for a network under general
interference constraints, and time varying channel. We study the case where the
channel statistics are known, but the current channel state is unknown. We
propose two scheduling policies, namely, the virtual queue based policy and
age-based policy. In the virtual queue based policy, the scheduler schedules
links with maximum weighted sum of the virtual queue lengths, while in the
age-based policy, the scheduler schedules links with maximum weighted sum of a
function of link AoI. We prove that the virtual queue based policy is peak age
optimal, up to an additive constant, while the age-based policy is at most
factor 4 away from the optimal age. Numerical results suggest that both the
proposed policies are, in fact, very close to the optimal.

result in additional phenomena and applications; interferometers and
diffraction gratings are two manifestations of such non-geometric, physical
optics. Incidentally, the most precise measurement ever, at one part per 10^21
in the (2017) Nobel winning discovery of gravitational waves was achieved with
an interferometer. Amendments to the properties of the medium promise negative
refractive index meta-materials, perfect imaging, light cloaking, and other
ultra-natural marvels. Attention to photon phase, correlations, statistics and
wavelength independent phase shifts result in singular optics, quantum optics
and anholonomy. Here we present another possibility, namely 'Arago-optics' to
maximize the efficacy of a device by strategically deploying the key qualities
along its perimeter. For instance, in conventional sources, waves are generated
with maximum intensity at the core; whereas in an Arago-source, intensity is
minimal or zero at the center, but highest on villus stretches at the margins.
We reason that for a given size and energy output, this radiation profile,
produces the highest concentration of energy at the focus, with the maximal
confinement of the wave packet. Likewise, the utmost detector resolution is
attained when sensitivity is highest on the perimeter and less at the center.
This concept holds beyond ultra-focus and Gaussian beams, but generally applies
to beams of 'waves' that show constructive and destructive interference. The
idea is particularly well suited for a fresh integration of geometry and
topology with electronics and materials into real-time wave engineering.

seq-shellability. In this work, we improve these results and introduce the new

the Harary-Hill Conjecture for specific classes rely on a fixed reference face.

Furthermore, we introduce the notion of $k$-deviations as the difference
between an optimal and the actual number of $k$-edges. Using $k$-deviations, we
gain interesting insights into the essence of $k$-edges, and we further relax
the necessity of fixed reference faces.
