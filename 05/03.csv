relate the dimension of an inhomogeneous attractor to the condensation set and
associated homogeneous attractor. This has been achieved only in specific
settings, with notable results by Olsen, Snigireva, Fraser and K\""aenm\""aki on
inhomogeneous self-similar sets, and by Burrell and Fraser on inhomogeneous
self-affine sets. This paper is devoted to filling a significant gap in the
dimension theory of inhomogeneous attractors, by studying those formed from
arbitrary bi-Lipschitz contractions. We show that the maximum of the dimension
of the condensation set and a quantity related to pressure, which we term upper
Lipschitz dimension, forms a natural and general upper bound on the dimension.
Additionally, we begin a new line of enquiry; the methods developed are used to
investigate the Hausdorff measure of inhomogeneous attractors. Our results have
applications for affine systems with affinity dimension less than or equal to
one and systems satisfying bounded distortion, such as conformal systems in
dimensions greater than one.

initiative focused on developing a cyber-physical system for the monitoring,
analysis and mitigation of urban noise pollution. Noise pollution is one of the
topmost quality of life issues for urban residents in the U.S. with proven
effects on health, education, the economy, and the environment. Yet, most
cities lack the resources to continuously monitor noise and understand the
contribution of individual sources, the tools to analyze patterns of noise
pollution at city-scale, and the means to empower city agencies to take
effective, data-driven action for noise mitigation. The SONYC project advances
novel technological and socio-technical solutions that help address these
needs.
  SONYC includes a distributed network of both sensors and people for
large-scale noise monitoring. The sensors use low-cost, low-power technology,
and cutting-edge machine listening techniques, to produce calibrated acoustic
measurements and recognize individual sound sources in real time. Citizen
science methods are used to help urban residents connect to city agencies and
each other, understand their noise footprint, and facilitate reporting and
self-regulation. Crucially, SONYC utilizes big data solutions to analyze,
retrieve and visualize information from sensors and citizens, creating a
comprehensive acoustic model of the city that can be used to identify
significant patterns of noise pollution. These data can be used to drive the
strategic application of noise code enforcement by city agencies to optimize
the reduction of noise pollution. The entire system, integrating cyber,
physical and social infrastructure, forms a closed loop of continuous sensing,
analysis and actuation on the environment.
  SONYC provides a blueprint for the mitigation of noise pollution that can
potentially be applied to other cities in the US and abroad.

additional relaxation that our observer makes active choices whether or not to
observe and how to observe. We mask the nodes in a directed acyclic graph of
the model that are observable, effectively optimising whether or not an
observation should be made at each time step. The reason for this is simple: it
is prudent to seek to reduce sensor costs, since resources (e.g. hardware,
personnel and time) are finite. Consequently, rather than treating our plant as
if it had infinite sensing resources, we seek to jointly maximise the utility
of each perception. This reduces resource expenditure by explicitly minimising
an observation-associated cost (e.g. battery use) while also facilitating the
potential to yield better state estimates by virtue of being able to use more
perceptions in noisy or unpredictable regions of state-space (e.g. a busy
traffic junction). We present a general formalisation and notation of this
problem, capable of encompassing much of the prior art. To illustrate our
formulation, we pose and solve two example problems in this domain. Finally we
suggest active areas of research to improve and further generalise this

arises when the photoelectrons are emitted simultaneously. Neglecting the
momentum of the incoming photon and the momentum transferred to the molecule,
it follows that the momenta of the individual photoelectrons are oppositely
directed and equal in magnitude. Under steady-state conditions, the ion
concentration is proportional to the rate at which the ions are created which,
in turn, varies as the product of the densities of states of the individual
electrons. The latter vary as the square root of the kinetic energy, leading to
overall linear behavior. The origin of the linear behavior in pyrrole and
related molecules is attributed to the presence of atoms that destroy the
periodicity of a hypothetical carbon loop. In contrast, the resonant behavior
observed in pyridine and related molecules, where a fraction of the CH pairs is
replaced by N atoms, is associated with electron transfer between the nitrogen
atoms and carbon atoms that preserves the periodicity of the closed loop.

important ramifications for Earth's biologic and geologic history. Despite this
importance, the history and cycling of nitrogen in the Earth system is poorly
constrained over time. For example, various models and proxies contrastingly
support atmospheric mass stasis, net outgassing, or net ingassing over time. In
addition, the amount available to and processing of nitrogen by organisms is
intricately linked with and provides feedbacks on oxygen and nutrient cycles.
To investigate the Earth system nitrogen cycle over geologic history, we have
constructed a new nitrogen cycle model: EarthN. This model is driven by mantle
cooling, links biologic nitrogen cycling to phosphate and oxygen, and
incorporates geologic and biologic fluxes. Model output is consistent with
large (2-4x) changes in atmospheric mass over time, typically indicating
atmospheric drawdown and nitrogen sequestration into the mantle and continental
crust. Critical controls on nitrogen distribution include mantle cooling
history, weathering, and the total Bulk Silicate Earth+atmosphere nitrogen
budget. Linking the nitrogen cycle to phosphorous and oxygen levels, instead of
carbon as has been previously done, provides new and more dynamic insight into

them to learn complex human goals and preferences. One approach to specifying

a human to directly judge. To help address this concern, we propose training
agents via self play on a zero sum debate game. Given a question or proposed
action, two agents take turns making short statements up to a limit, then a
human judges which of the agents gave the most true, useful information. In an
analogy to complexity theory, debate with optimal play can answer any question
in PSPACE given polynomial time judges (direct judging answers only NP
questions). In practice, whether debate works involves empirical questions
about humans and the tasks we want AIs to perform, plus theoretical questions
about the meaning of AI alignment. We report results on an initial MNIST

remain anonymous: Search logs can reveal sensitive details about a user,
critical articles or messages about a company or government might have severe
or fatal consequences for a critic, and negative feedback in customer surveys
might negatively impact business relations if they are identified. Simply
removing personally identifying information from a document is, however,
insufficient to protect the writer's identity: Given some reference texts of
suspect authors, so-called authorship attribution methods can reidentfy the
author from the text itself.
  One of the most prominent models to represent documents in many common text

approach that produces synthetic term frequency vectors for the input documents

kinematics of the MW dwarf galaxies. We use the Gaia DR2 for those dwarfs that
have been spectroscopically observed in the literature. We derive systemic PMs
for 39 galaxies and galaxy candidates out to 420 kpc, and generally find good
consistency for the subset with measurements available from other studies. We
derive the implied Galactocentric velocities, and calculate orbits in canonical
MW halo potentials of ""low"" ($0.8 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$) and ""high"" mass
($1.6 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$). Comparison of the distributions of orbital
apocenters and 3D velocities to the halo virial radius and escape velocity,
respectively, suggests that the satellite kinematics are best explained in the
high-mass halo. Tuc III, Crater II, and additional candidates have orbital
pericenters small enough to imply significant tidal influences. Relevant to the
missing satellite problem, the fact that fewer galaxies are observed to be near
apocenter than near pericenter implies that there must be a population of
distant dwarf galaxies yet to be discovered. Of the 39 dwarfs: 12 have orbital
poles that do not align with the MW plane of satellites (given reasonable
assumptions about its intrinsic thickness); 10 have insufficient PM accuracy to
establish whether they align; and 17 satellites align, of which 11 are
co-orbiting and (somewhat surprisingly, in view of prior knowledge) 6 are
counter-orbiting. Group infall might have contributed to this, but no
definitive association is found for the members of the Crater-Leo group.

allows us to bring to bear a wide array of approximate inference tools, extend
the model in flexible and powerful ways, and reason about compositionality and
partial observability. In this article, we will discuss how a generalization of
the reinforcement learning or optimal control problem, which is sometimes
termed maximum entropy reinforcement learning, is equivalent to exact
probabilistic inference in the case of deterministic dynamics, and variational
inference in the case of stochastic dynamics. We will present a detailed
derivation of this framework, overview prior work that has drawn on this and

its error with the size of the network. This is done by reinterpreting SGD as
the evolution of a particle system with interactions governed by a potential

that, when the number $n$ of units is large, the empirical distribution of the
particles descends on a convex landscape towards the global minimum at a rate
independent of $n$, with a resulting approximation error that universally
scales as $O(n^{-1})$. These properties are established in the form of a Law of
Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the empirical distribution. Our
analysis also quantifies the scale and nature of the noise introduced by SGD
and provides guidelines for the step size and batch size to use when training a
neural network. We illustrate our findings on examples in which we train neural

incorporating flux rope expansion. Several flux rope expansion modes are
considered, which can lead to different FD characteristics. In general, the
model is qualitatively in agreement with observations, whereas quantitative
agreement depends on the diffusion coefficient and the expansion properties
(interplay of the diffusion and the expansion). A case study was performed to
explain the FD observed 2014 May 30. The observed FD was fitted quite well by
ForbMod for all expansion modes using only the diffusion coefficient as a free

point-in-time observations. Here, a new forecast method is presented based upon
the 24-hr evolution in McIntosh classification of sunspot groups.
Evolution-dependent $\geqslant$C1.0 and $\geqslant$M1.0 flaring rates are found
from NOAA-numbered sunspot groups over December 1988 to June 1996 (Solar Cycle
22; SC22) before converting to probabilities assuming Poisson statistics. These
flaring probabilities are used to generate operational forecasts for sunspot
groups over July 1996 to December 2008 (SC23), with performance studied by
verification metrics. Major findings are: i) considering Brier skill score
(BSS) for $\geqslant$C1.0 flares, the evolution-dependent McIntosh-Poisson
method ($\text{BSS}_{\text{evolution}}=0.09$) performs better than the static
McIntosh-Poisson method ($\text{BSS}_{\text{static}} = -0.09$); ii) low BSS
values arise partly from both methods over-forecasting SC23 flares from the
SC22 rates, symptomatic of $\geqslant$C1.0 rates in SC23 being on average
$\approx$80% of those in SC22 (with $\geqslant$M1.0 being $\approx$50%); iii)
applying a bias-correction factor to reduce the SC22 rates used in forecasting
SC23 flares yields modest improvement in skill relative to climatology for both
methods ($\mathrm{BSS}^{\mathrm{corr}}_{\mathrm{static}} = 0.09$ and
$\mathrm{BSS}^{\mathrm{corr}}_{\mathrm{evolution}} = 0.20$) and improved

set of optimizations.
  This paper introduces GraphIt, a new DSL for graph computations that
generates fast implementations for algorithms with different performance
characteristics running on graphs with different sizes and structures. GraphIt
separates what is computed (algorithm) from how it is computed (schedule).
Programmers specify the algorithm using an algorithm language, and performance
optimizations are specified using a scheduling language. The algorithm language
simplifies expressing the algorithms. We formulate graph optimizations,
including edge traversal direction, data layout, parallelization, cache, NUMA,
and kernel fusion optimizations, as tradeoffs among locality, parallelism, and
work-efficiency. The scheduling language enables programmers to easily search
through this complicated tradeoff space by composing together optimizations. We
also built an autotuner to automatically find high-performance schedules. The
compiler uses a new scheduling representation, the graph iteration space, to
model, compose, and ensure the validity of the large number of optimizations.
GraphIt outperforms the next fastest of six state-of-the-art shared-memory

explicitly construct an interaction tensor for free gravity and matter, that
depicts the interplay between the energy momentum tensor of free gravity, which
is taken to be the symmetric two index square root of Bell-Robinson tensor, and
matter. This is examined both in the case of Coulomb-like Petrov type D
spacetimes and radiation like Petrov type N spacetimes, where a unique square
root exists. The first case generalises the Tweedledum and Tweedledee thought
experiment regarding gravitational induction in Newtonian gravity to general
relativistic scenarios, and the second gives a proposal for how gravitational
radiation can transfer energy and momentum between distant objects separated by
a vacuum.

analysis of $\alpha$ Cen AB based on high-quality HARPS data. Various line
lists are used and analysis strategies implemented to improve the reliability
of the results. Abundances of 21 species with a typical precision of 0.02-0.03
dex are reported. We find that the chemical composition of the two stars is not
scaled solar (e.g. Na and Ni excess, depletion of neutron-capture elements),
but that their patterns are strikingly similar, with a mean abundance
difference (A - B) with respect to hydrogen of -0.01$\pm$0.04 dex. Much of the
scatter may be ascribed to physical effects that are not fully removed through
a differential analysis because of the mismatch in parameters between the two
components. We derive an age for the system from abundance indicators (e.g.
[Y/Mg] and [Y/Al]) that is slightly larger than solar and in agreement with
most asteroseismic results. Assuming coeval formation for the three components
belonging to the system, this implies an age of about $\sim$6 Gyrs for the M
dwarf hosting the terrestrial planet Proxima Cen b. After correction for
Galactic chemical evolution effects, we find a trend between the abundance
ratios and condensation temperature in $\alpha$ Cen A akin to that of the Sun.
However, taking this finding as evidence for the sequestration of rocky
material locked up in planets may be premature given that a clear link between
the two phenomena remains to be established. The similarity between the
abundance pattern of the binary components argues against the swallowing of a
massive planet by one of the stars after the convective zones have shrunk to
their present-day sizes.

that they possess an energy spectrum with correlations universally described by

well defined classical limit as well as by systems with no classical
correspondence, such as locally interacting spins or fermions. Despite great
phenomenological success, a general mechanism explaining the emergence of RMT
without reference to semiclassical concepts is still missing. Here we provide
the example of a quantum many-body system with no semiclassical limit (no large
parameter) where the emergence of RMT spectral correlations is proven exactly.
Specifically, we consider a periodically driven Ising model and write the
Fourier transform of spectral density's two-point function, the spectral form
factor, in terms of a partition function of a two-dimensional classical Ising
model featuring a space-time duality. We show that the self-dual cases provide
a minimal model of many-body quantum chaos, where the spectral form factor is
demonstrated to match RMT for all values of the integer time variable $t$ in
the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we rigorously prove RMT form factor for
odd $t$, while we formulate a precise conjecture for even $t$. The results
imply ergodicity for any finite amount of disorder in the longitudinal field,
rigorously excluding the possibility of many-body localization. Our method
provides a novel route for obtaining exact nonperturbative results in

branches of chiral edge states. The negative energy states are related to the
ground-state angular momentum, $L_z = (N/2) \hbar$, for $N/2$ Cooper pairs. The
power law suppression of the angular momentum, $L_z(T) \simeq (N/2)\,\hbar\,[1

discuss the effects of wave function overlap, and hybridization between edge
states confined near opposing edge boundaries on the edge currents,
ground-state angular momentum and ground-state order parameter of superfluid
$^3$He thin films. Under strong lateral confinement, the chiral A phase
undergoes a sequence of phase transitions, first to a pair density wave (PDW)
phase with broken translational symmetry at $D_{c2} \sim 16 \xi_0$. The PDW
phase is described by a periodic array of chiral domains with alternating
chirality, separated by domain walls. The period of PDW phase diverges as the
confinement length $D\rightarrow D_{c_2}$. The PDW phase breaks time-reversal
symmetry, translation invariance, but is invariant under the combination of
time-reversal and translation by a one-half period of the PDW. The mass current
distribution of the PDW phase reflects this combined symmetry, and originates
from the spectra of edge Fermions and the chiral branches bound to the domain
walls. Under sufficiently strong confinement a second-order transition occurs
to the non-chiral ``polar phase'' at $D_{c1} \sim 9\xi_0$, in which a single
p-wave orbital state of Cooper pairs is aligned along the channel.

turbulent pressure $P_\mathrm{turb}\propto\Sigma\,\sigma^2$, which spans

`bubble' develops inside the planet's co-orbital region, which introduces
unsteadiness in the flow. The resulting disc-planet torques sustain large
amplitude oscillations that persists well beyond that in simulations with
perfectly coupled dust or low dust-loading, where co-rotation torques are

as much as a factor of 30 in the MrAGN runs when compared with the NoAGN runs.
The histories of NoAGN galaxies are recycling-dominated, with ~70% of material

re-accretes on 1 Gyr timescales without AGN feedback. Outflowing gas in the
MrAGN runs has higher characteristic velocity (500 - 1,000 km/s versus 100-300

with the Br $\alpha$ peak of the supernebula and its associated molecular
cloud. The spectra of the supernebula exhibit Br $\alpha$ emission with a
strong, narrow core. The linewidths are 65-76 km s$^{-1}$, FWHM, comparable to
those around individual ultra-compact HII regions within our Galaxy. A weak,
broad (FWHM$\simeq$150-175 km s$^{-1}$) component is detected on the base of
the line, which could trace a population of sources with high-velocity winds.
The core velocity of Br $\alpha$ emission shifts by +13 km s$^{-1}$ from NE to
SW across the supernebula, possibly indicating a bipolar outflow from an
embedded object, or linked to a foreground redshifted gas filament. The results
can be explained if the supernebula comprises thousands of ionized wind regions

radiative cooling and unable to merge to drive a coherent cluster wind. Based
on the absence of an outflow with large mass loss, we conclude that feedback is

worse after one pass, but that after three or more passes, the errors are very

Magellanic Cloud, and is therefore crucial for the study of binary interaction
and formation of WR stars at low metallicity. The WR component in AB 6 was
previously found to be very luminous (logL=6.3[Lsun]) compared to its reported
orbital mass (8Msun), placing it significantly above the Eddington limit.
Through spectroscopy and orbital analysis of newly acquired optical data taken
with UVES, we aim to understand the peculiar results reported for this system
and explore its evolutionary history.
  Results: We find that AB 6 contains at least four stars. The 6.5d period WR
binary comprises the WR primary (WN3:h, star A) and a rather rapidly rotating
early O-type companion (O5.5 V, star B). Static N and He lines suggest the
presence of an emission line star (O5.5 I(f), star C). Finally, narrow
absorption lines portraying a long-term radial velocity variation show the
existence of a fourth star (O7.5 V, star D). Star D appears to form a second
140d period binary together with a fifth stellar member, which is a B-type
dwarf or a black hole. It is not clear that these additional components are
bound to the WR binary. The WR star is found to be less luminous than
previously thought (logL = 5.9[Lsun]) and, adopting 41Msun for star B, more
massive (18Msun). Correspondingly, the WR star does not exceed the Eddington
limit. We derive the initial masses of 60 and 40Msun for stars A and B and an
age of 3.9 Myr for the system. The WR binary likely experienced nonconservative
mass transfer in the past supported by the relatively rapid rotation of star B.
  Conclusion: Our study shows that AB 6 is a multiple -- probably quintuple --
system. This finding resolves the previously reported puzzle of the WR primary
exceeding the Eddington limit and suggests that the WR star exchanged mass with
its companion in the past.

investigate techniques that utilize closure phase spectra for redundant triads
to estimate departures from redundancy for redundant baseline visibilities. We
find a median absolute deviation from redundancy in closure phase across the
observed frequency range of about 4.5deg. This value translates into a
non-redundancy per visibility phase of about 2.6deg, using prototype
electronics. The median absolute deviations from redundancy decrease with
longer baselines. We show that closure phase spectra can be used to identify
ill-behaved antennas in the array, independent of calibration. We investigate
the temporal behavior of closure spectra. The Allan variance increases after a
one minute stride time, due to passage of the sky through the primary beam of
the transit telescope. However, the closure spectra repeat to well within the
noise per measurement at corresponding local sidereal times (LST) from day to

promising probes of the epoch of cosmic reionization -- a major phase
transition of the Universe. However, these studies face severe challenges
imposed by the bright foreground emission from cosmic objects. Current
techniques require precise instrumental calibration to separate the weak
H\,{\sc i} line signal from the foreground continuum emission. We propose to
mitigate this calibration requirement by using measurements of the
interferometric bi-spectrum phase. Bi-spectrum phase is unaffected by
antenna-based direction-independent calibration errors and hence for a compact
array it depends on the sky brightness distribution only (subject to the usual
thermal-like noise). We show that the bi-spectrum phase of foreground
synchrotron continuum has a characteristically smooth spectrum relative to the
cosmological line signal. The two can be separated effectively by exploiting
this spectral difference using Fourier techniques, while eliminating the need
for precise antenna-based calibration of phases introduced by the instrument,
and the ionosphere, inherent in existing approaches. Using fiducial models for
continuum foregrounds, and for the cosmological H\,{\sc i} signal, we show the
latter should be detectable in bi-spectrum phase spectra, with reasonable
significance at $|k_\parallel| \gtrsim 0.5\,h$~Mpc$^{-1}$, using existing
instruments. Our approach will also benefit other H\,{\sc i} intensity mapping
experiments that face similar challenges, such as those measuring Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations (BAO).

rib roughness by attaching up to 6 axial obstacles to the surfaces of the
cylinders over an extensive range of rib heights, up to blockages of 25% of the
gap width. In the asymptotic ultimate regime, where the transport is
independent of viscosity, we emperically find that the prefactor of the
$Nu_{\omega} \propto Ta^{1/2}$ scaling (corresponding to the drag coefficient
$C_f(Re)$ being constant) scales with the number of ribs $N_r$ and by the rib
height $h^{1.71}$. The physical mechanism behind this is that the dominant
contribution to the torque originates from the pressure forces acting on the
rib which scale with rib height. The measured scaling relation of $N_r
h^{1.71}$ is slightly smaller than the expected $N_r h^2$ scaling, presumably
because the ribs cannot be regarded as completely isolated but interact. In the
counter-rotating regime with smooth walls, the momentum transport is increased
by turbulent Taylor vortices. We find that also in the presence of transverse
ribs these vortices persist. In the counter-rotating regime, even for large
roughness heights, the momentum transport is enhanced by these vortices.

The distribution of rotational temperatures shows a primary population around

CO lines decreases as the difference between $J$-level between two CO lines
increases. The multiple origins of CO emission previously revealed by
velocity-resolved profiles are consistent with this smooth distribution if each
physical component contributes to a wide range of CO lines with significant
overlap in the CO ladder. We investigate the spatial extent of CO emission and
find that the morphology is more centrally peaked and less bipolar at high-$J$

Transition disks (TDs) are circumstellar disks with inner regions
highly depleted in dust. TDs are observed in a small fraction of disk-bearing
objects at ages of 1-10 Myr. They are important laboratories to study
evolutionary effects in disks, from photoevaporation to planet-disk
interactions.
  Aims. We report the discovery of a large inner dust-empty region in the disk
around the very low mass star CIDA 1 (M$_{\star} \sim 0.1-0.2$ M$_{\odot}$).
  Methods. We used ALMA continuum observations at 887$\mu$m, which provide a
spatial resolution of $0.""21\times0.""12$ ($\sim$15$\times$8 au in radius at 140
pc).
  Results. The data show a dusty ring with a clear cavity of radius $\sim$20
au, the typical characteristic of a TD. The emission in the ring is well
described by a narrow Gaussian profile. The dust mass in the disk is $\sim$17
M$_{\oplus}$. CIDA 1 is one of the lowest mass stars with a clearly detected
millimeter cavity. When compared to objects of similar stellar mass, it has a
relatively massive dusty disk (less than $\sim5$% of Taurus Class II disks in
Taurus have a ratio of $M_{\rm{disk}}/M_{\star}$ larger than CIDA 1) and a very
high mass accretion rate (CIDA 1 is a disk with one of the lowest values of
$M_{\rm{disk}}/\dot M$ ever observed). In light of these unusual parameters, we
discuss a number of possible mechanisms that can be responsible for the
formation of the dust cavity (e.g., photoevaporation, dead zones, embedded
planets, close binary). We find that an embedded planet of a Saturn mass or a
close binary are the most likely possibilities.

star fraction (CSF) in the 10-60 au range of 21+8/-5%, consistent with that
observed in other star-forming regions (SFRs) and twice as high as among field
stars; this excess is found with a high level of confidence. Since our sample
is dominated by disk-bearing targets, this indicates that disk disruption by
close binaries is inefficient, or has not yet taken place, in the ONC. The
resulting separation distribution in the ONC drops sharply outside 60\,au.
These findings are consistent with a scenario in which the initial multiplicity
properties, set by the star formation process itself, are identical in the ONC
and in other SFRs and subsequently altered by the cluster's dynamical
evolution. This implies that the fragmentation process does not depend on the
global properties of a molecular cloud, but on the local properties of
prestellar cores, and that the latter are self-regulated to be nearly identical
in a wide range of environments. These results, however, raise anew the
question of the origin of field stars as the tight binaries we have discovered
will not be destroyed as the ONC dissolves into the galactic field. It thus
appears that most field stars formed in regions differ from well-studied SFRs
in the Solar neighborhood, possibly due to changes in core fragmentation on Gyr
timescales.

the core radius and the central luminosity density, which are expected to
change with the long-term cluster dynamical evolution. An interesting relation
is emerging between A+ and the ratio of the BSS velocity dispersion relative to
that of main sequence turn-off stars, which measures the degree of energy
equipartition experienced by BSSs in the cluster. These results provide further

Such studies neglect to address the endurance and cost of SSDs, which can
significantly affect the efficiency of I/O caching. Moreover, previous studies
only configure the cache size to provide the required performance level for
each VM, while neglecting other important parameters such as cache write policy
and request type, which can adversely affect both performance-per-cost and
endurance.
  In this paper, we present a new high-Endurance and Cost-efficient I/O Caching
(ECI-Cache) scheme for virtualized platforms, which can significantly improve
both the performance-per-cost and endurance of storage subsystems as opposed to
previously proposed I/O caching schemes. Unlike traditional I/O caching schemes
which allocate cache size only based on reuse distance of accesses, we propose
a new metric, Useful Reuse Distance (URD), which considers the request type in
reuse distance calculation, resulting in improved performance-per-cost and
endurance for the SSD cache. Via online characterization of workloads and using
URD, ECI-Cache partitions the SSD cache across VMs and is able to dynamically
adjust the cache size and write policy for each VM. To evaluate the proposed
scheme, we have implemented ECI-Cache in an open source hypervisor, QEMU
(version 2.8.0), on a server running the CentOS 7 operating system (kernel
version 3.10.0-327). Experimental results show that our proposed scheme
improves the performance, performance-per-cost, and endurance of the SSD cache
by 17%, 30% and 65%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art dynamic
cache partitioning scheme.

  Vehicle Systems","8 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.SY cs.AI math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To operate effectively in tomorrow's smart cities, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
must rely on intra-vehicle sensors such as camera and radar as well as
inter-vehicle communication. Such dependence on sensors and communication links
exposes AVs to cyber-physical (CP) attacks by adversaries that seek to take
control of the AVs by manipulating their data. Thus, to ensure safe and optimal
AV dynamics control, the data processing functions at AVs must be robust to
such CP attacks. To this end, in this paper, the state estimation process for
monitoring AV dynamics, in presence of CP attacks, is analyzed and a novel
adversarial deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to maximize
the robustness of AV dynamics control to CP attacks. The attacker's action and
the AV's reaction to CP attacks are studied in a game-theoretic framework. In
the formulated game, the attacker seeks to inject faulty data to AV sensor
readings so as to manipulate the inter-vehicle optimal safe spacing and
potentially increase the risk of AV accidents or reduce the vehicle flow on the
roads. Meanwhile, the AV, acting as a defender, seeks to minimize the
deviations of spacing so as to ensure robustness to the attacker's actions.
Since the AV has no information about the attacker's action and due to the
infinite possibilities for data value manipulations, the outcome of the
players' past interactions are fed to long-short term memory (LSTM) blocks.
Each player's LSTM block learns the expected spacing deviation resulting from
its own action and feeds it to its RL algorithm. Then, the the attacker's RL
algorithm chooses the action which maximizes the spacing deviation, while the
AV's RL algorithm tries to find the optimal action that minimizes such
deviation.

Telescope (HST), the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Euclid mission, and
the WFIRST telescope.
  METHODS: We used the SPLAT SPEX/ISPEX spectroscopic library to map out the
colors of the M-, L-, and T-type dwarfs. We have identified which color-color
combination is optimal for identifying broad type and which single color is
optimal to then identify the subtype (e.g., T0-9). We evaluated each
observatory separately as well as the narrow-field (HST and JWST) and
wide-field (Euclid and WFIRST) combinations.
  RESULTS: The Euclid filters perform poorly typing brown dwarfs and WFIRST
performs only marginally better, despite a wider selection of filters. WFIRST's
W146 and F062 combined with Euclid's Y-band discriminates somewhat better
between broad brown dwarf categories. However, subtyping with any combination
of Euclid and WFIRST observations remains uncertain due to the lack of medium
or narrow-band filters. We argue that a medium band added to the WFIRST filter
selection would greatly improve its ability to preselect brown dwarfs its
imaging surveys.
  CONCLUSIONS: The HST filters used in high-redshift searches are close to
optimal to identify broad stellar type. However, the addition of F127M to the
commonly used broad filter sets would allow for unambiguous subtyping. An
improvement over HST is one of two broad and medium filter combinations on
JWST: pairing F140M with either F150W or F162M discriminates very well between
subtypes.

open problem whether there always exist coordinate transformations which smooth
a gravitational metric to optimal regularity, two full derivatives above the
curvature tensor, or whether regularity singularities exist. We resolve this
open problem above a threshold level of smoothness by proving in this paper
that the existence of such coordinate transformations is equivalent to solving
a system of nonlinear elliptic equations in the unknown Jacobian and
transformed connection, both viewed as matrix valued differential forms. We
name these the Regularity Transformation equations, or RT-equations. In a
companion paper we prove existence of solutions to the RT-equations for
connections $\Gamma\in W^{m,p},$ curvature ${\rm Riem}(\Gamma) \in W^{m,p}$,

exist coordinate transformations which smooth arbitrary connections to optimal
regularity, (one derivative more regular than the curvature), and there are no
regularity singularities, above the threshold $m\geq1$, $p>n$. Authors are
currently working on extending these methods to the case of GR shock waves,
when gravitational metrics are only Lipschitz continuous, ($m=0$, $p=\infty$),
and optimal regularity is required to recover basic properties of spacetime.

exhibits a large change in complex refractive index on the order of unity upon
switching from its dielectric to its metallic phase. Although this property is
key for the design of ultracompact optical modulators of only a few microns in
footprint, the high absorption of ${\rm VO}_2$ leads to appreciable insertion
loss (IL) that limits the modulator performance. In this paper, through theory
and numerical modeling, we report on a new paradigm, which demonstrates how the
use of a hybrid plasmonic waveguide to construct a ${\rm VO}_2$ based modulator
can improve the performance by minimizing its IL while achieving high
extinction ratio (ER) in comparison to a purely dielectric waveguide. The
hybrid plasmonic waveguide that contains an additional metal layer with even
higher loss than ${\rm VO}_2$ enables unique approaches to engineer the
electric field (E-field) intensity distribution within the cross section of the
modulator. The resulting figure-of-merit, FoM = ER/IL, is much higher than what
is possible by simply incorporating ${\rm VO}_2$ into a silicon wire waveguide.
A practical modulator design using this new approach, which also includes input
and output couplers yields ER = 3.8 dB/{\mu}m and IL = 1.4 dB/{\mu}m (FoM =
2.7), with a 3-dB optical bandwidth >500 nm, in a device length = 2 {\mu}m, and
cross-sectional dimensions = 200 nm $\times$ 450 nm. To the best of our
knowledge, this is one of the smallest modulator designs proposed to date that
also exhibits amongst the highest ER, FoM, and optical bandwidth, in comparison
to existing designs. In addition to ${\rm VO}_2$, we investigate two other PCMs
incorporated within the waveguide structure. The improvements obtained for
${\rm VO}_2$ modulators do not extend to other PCMs.

the foundation for optical flow methods and has been generalised to said

time-varying surfaces which are embedded in Euclidean 3-space and derive a
generalised continuity equation. The main motivation for this work is efficient
cell motion estimation in time-lapse (4D) volumetric fluorescence microscopy
images of a living zebrafish embryo. Increasing spatial and temporal resolution
of modern microscopes require efficient analysis of such data. With this
application in mind we address this need and follow an emerging paradigm in
this field: dimensional reduction. In light of the ill-posedness of considered
conservation laws we employ Tikhonov regularisation and propose the use of
spatially varying regularisation functionals that recover motion only in
regions with cells. For the efficient numerical solution we devise a Galerkin
method based on compactly supported (tangent) vectorial basis functions.
Furthermore, for the fast and accurate estimation of the evolving sphere-like
surface from scattered data we utilise surface interpolation with
spatio-temporal regularisation. We present numerical results based on
aforementioned zebrafish microscopy data featuring fluorescently labelled

There is indication of two populations of young stars in the OB1b region,

overlapping on front of OB1b. The various groups and regions can be ordered in

we propose tools for understanding how data determine estimates in these
models, using a spectral basis approximation to the GP under which the
restricted likelihood is formally identical to the likelihood for a
gamma-errors GLM with identity link. Second, to examine the data's support for
a covariate and to understand how adding that covariate moves variation in the
outcome y out of the GP and error parts of the fit, we apply a linear-model
diagnostic, the added variable plot (AVP), both to the original observations
and to projections of the data onto the spectral basis functions. The spectral-
and observation-domain AVPs estimate the same coefficient for a covariate but
emphasize low- and high-frequency data features respectively and thus highlight
the covariate's effect on the GP and error parts of the fit respectively. The
spectral approximation applies to data observed on a regular grid; for data
observed at irregular locations, we propose smoothing the data to a grid before
applying our methods. The methods are illustrated using the forest-biomass data

electromagnetic problem, we find that a radiative effect is indeed observed;
from an inertial point of view, the process arises from a collision of the
negative vacuum energy of Rindler space with the mirror. There is a qualitative
symmetry under interchange of accelerated and inertial subsystems (a

basic emotion expressions, but also a full range of other emotions and subtle
emotion intensities that we both feel in ourselves and perceive in others in

dimensional measures so that we transformed facial expression analysis from a
classification problem to a regression one. We then tested our CNN-based
methods for facial expression regression and these methods demonstrated
promising performance. Moreover, we improved our method by a bilinear pooling

fixed co-ordinate frame in, SE(3), is an omnipresent problem in medical image
analysis with applications such as: image rigid registration, anatomical
standard plane detection, tracking and device/camera pose estimation. Deep
learning methods often parameterise a pose with a representation that separates
rotation and translation. As commonly available frameworks do not provide means
to calculate loss on a manifold, regression is usually performed using the
L2-norm independently on the rotation's and the translation's
parameterisations, which is a metric for linear spaces that does not take into
account the Lie group structure of SE(3). In this paper, we propose a general
Riemannian formulation of the pose estimation problem. We propose to train the
CNN directly on SE(3) equipped with a left-invariant Riemannian metric,
coupling the prediction of the translation and rotation defining the pose. At
each training step, the ground truth and predicted pose are elements of the
manifold, where the loss is calculated as the Riemannian geodesic distance. We
then compute the optimisation direction by back-propagating the gradient with
respect to the predicted pose on the tangent space of the manifold SE(3) and
update the network weights. We thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of our
loss function by comparing its performance with popular and most commonly used
existing methods, on tasks such as image-based localisation and intensity-based
2D/3D registration. We also show that hyper-parameters, used in our loss
function to weight the contribution between rotations and translations, can be
intrinsically calculated from the dataset to achieve greater performance

ratios of $L/D=6$ and $W/D=2$ at $Re_D=10^4$ using large eddy simulations
(LES). For the spanwise-periodic cavity flow, large pressure fluctuations are
present in the shear layer and on the cavity aft wall due to spanwise vortex
roll-ups and flow impingement. For the finite-span cavity with sidewalls,
pressure fluctuations are reduced due to interference to the vortex roll-ups
from the sidewalls. Flow oscillations are also reduced by increasing the Mach
number from 0.6 to 1.4. Furthermore, secondary flow inside the cavity enhances
kinetic energy transport in the spanwise direction. Moreover, 3D slotted jets
are placed along the cavity leading edge with the objective of reducing flow
oscillations. Steady blowing into the boundary layer is considered with

a spanwise wavenumber of $\beta=0$. To uncover spanwise effects on the 2D
wake-mode, 3D DNS are performed with cavity width-to-depth ratio of $W/D=1$ and
$2$. We find that the 2D wake-mode is not present in the 3D cavity flow for a
wider spanwise setting with $W/D=2$, in which spanwise structures are observed
near the rear region of the cavity. These 3D instabilities are further
investigated via bi-global stability analysis for spanwise wavelengths of

the findings of 2D and 3D global stability analysis, we conclude that the

bipartization (Odd Cycle Transversal), motivated by recent advances in
near-term quantum computing hardware and the related embedding problems. We
assemble a preprocessing suite of fast input reduction routines from the Odd
Cycle Transversal (OCT) and Vertex Cover (VC) literature, and compare algorithm
implementations using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems from
the quantum literature. We also generate a corpus of frustrated cluster loop
graphs, which have previously been used to benchmark quantum annealing
hardware. The diversity of these graphs leads to harder OCT instances than in
existing benchmarks.
  In addition to combinatorial branching algorithms for solving OCT directly,
we study various reformulations into other NP-hard problems such as VC and
Integer Linear Programming (ILP), enabling the use of solvers such as CPLEX. We
find that for heuristic solutions with time constraints under a second,
iterative compression routines jump-started with a heuristic solution perform
best, after which point using a highly tuned solver like CPLEX is worthwhile.
Results on exact solvers are split between using ILP formulations on CPLEX and
solving VC formulations with a branch-and-reduce solver. We extend our results
with a large corpus of synthetic graphs, establishing robustness and potential
to generalize to other domain data. In total, over 8000 graph instances are
evaluated, compared to the previous canonical corpus of 100 graphs.
  Finally, we provide all code and data in an open source suite, including a
Python API for accessing reduction routines and branching algorithms, along
with scripts for fully replicating our results.

EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) a dynamic system, thus improving its
performance is a challenging task. In addition, it is well-known that due to
non-stationarity based covariate shifts, the input data distributions of
EEG-based BCI systems change during inter- and intra-session transitions, which
poses great difficulty for developments of online adaptive data-driven systems.
Ensemble learning approaches have been used previously to tackle this
challenge. However, passive scheme based implementation leads to poor
efficiency while increasing high computational cost. This paper presents a
novel integration of covariate shift estimation and unsupervised adaptive
ensemble learning (CSE-UAEL) to tackle non-stationarity in motor-imagery (MI)
related EEG classification. The proposed method first employs an exponentially
weighted moving average model to detect the covariate shifts in the common
spatial pattern features extracted from MI related brain responses. Then, a
classifier ensemble was created and updated over time to account for changes in
streaming input data distribution wherein new classifiers are added to the
ensemble in accordance with estimated shifts. Furthermore, using two publicly
available BCI-related EEG datasets, the proposed method was extensively
compared with the state-of-the-art single-classifier based passive scheme,
single-classifier based active scheme and ensemble based passive schemes. The
experimental results show that the proposed active scheme based ensemble
learning algorithm significantly enhances the BCI performance in MI
classifications.

coding opportunities at the transmitter nodes. A study of these schemes reveal
that some of the overheard packets are not useful for coding operation and thus
this forced overhearing increases energy consumption dramatically. In this
paper, we formulate network coding aware sleep/wakeup scheduling as a semi

proposed solution for SMDP, the network nodes learn when to switch off their
transceiver in order to conserve energy and when to stay awake to overhear some
useful packets. One of the main challenges here is the delay in obtaining
reward signals by nodes. We employ a modified Reinforcement Learning (RL)

thin elastic capsules with spherical rest shape. Thermal fluctuations affect
the buckling instability by two mechanisms. On the one hand, thermal
fluctuations can renormalize the capsule's elastic properties and its pressure
because of anharmonic couplings between normal displacement modes of different
wavelengths. This effectively lowers its critical buckling pressure [Kosmrlj
and Nelson, Phys. Rev. X 7, 011002 (2017)]. On the other hand, buckled shapes
are energetically favorable already at pressures below the classical buckling
pressure. At these pressures, however, buckling requires to overcome an energy
barrier, which only vanishes at the critical buckling pressure. In the presence
of thermal fluctuations the capsule can spontaneously overcome an energy
barrier of the order of the thermal energy by thermal activation already at
pressures below the critical buckling pressure. We revisit parameter
renormalization by thermal fluctuations and formulate a buckling criterion
based on scale-dependent renormalized parameters to obtain a
temperature-dependent critical buckling pressure. Then we quantify the
pressure-dependent energy barrier for buckling below the critical buckling
pressure using numerical energy minimization and analytical arguments. This
allows us to obtain the temperature-dependent critical pressure for buckling by
thermal activation over this energy barrier. Finally, we study the combined
effect of parameter renormalization and thermal activation by using
renormalized parameters for the energy barrier in thermal activation to obtain
our final result for the temperature-dependent critical pressure, which is
significantly below the results if only parameter renormalization or only
thermal activation is considered.

  Problem",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Environments with fixed adjustment costs such as transaction costs or \lq
menu costs\rq$ $ are widespread within economic systems. The presence of fixed
minimal adjustment costs produces adjustment stickiness so that agents must
choose a sequence of points at which time to perform their actions. This paper
performs an analysis of the effect of transaction costs on agent behaviour
within a dynamic optimisation problem by way of introducing the theory of
incentive design to optimal stochastic impulse control. The setup consists of
an agent that maximises their utility by performing a sequence of purchases of
some consumable good over some time horizon whilst facing transaction costs and
a Principal that chooses the agent's transaction costs. This results in a
dynamic Principal-Agent model in which the agent uses impulse controls to
perform adjustments to their cash-flow process. We address the question of
which fixed value of the transaction cost the Principal must choose to induce a
desired behaviour from the agent. We study the effect of changes to the
transaction cost and show that with an appropriate choice of transaction cost,
the agent's preferences can be sufficiently distorted so that the agent finds
it optimal to maximise the Principal's objective even when the agent's
cash-flow is unobserved by the Principal.

stellar systems were formed in dwarf galaxies. To better establish the early
history of UCDs, we investigate the formation of UCD progenitor clusters from
super giant molecular clouds (SGMCs), using hydrodynamical simulations. In this
study we focus on SGMCs with masses $10^{7} - 10^{8} \rm M_{\odot}$ that can
form massive star clusters that display physical properties similar to UCDs. We
find that the clusters have extended star formation histories with two phases,
producing multiple distinct stellar populations, and that the star formation
rate is dependent on the feedback effects of SNe and AGB stars. The later
generations of stars formed in these clusters are more compact, leading to a
clearly nested structure, and these stars will be more He-rich than those of
the first generation, leading to a slight colour gradient. The simulated
clusters demonstrate scaling relations between $R_{\rm eff}$ and $M$ and
$\sigma_{v}$ and $M$ consistent with those observed in UCDs and strongly
consistent with those of the original SGMC. We discuss whether SGMCs such as
these can be formed through merging of self-gravitating molecular clouds in
galaxies at high-z.

are heavily biased in that they are completely blind to events for which no

deep learning approach toward image dehazing bypassing the step of transmission
map estimation and facilitating end-to-end perceptual optimization. Our
technical contributions are mainly three-fold. First, based on the analogy
between dehazing and denoising, we propose to directly learn a nonlinear
mapping from the space of degraded images to that of haze-free ones via
recursive deep residual learning; Second, inspired by the success of generative
adversarial networks (GAN), we propose to optimize the perceptual quality of
dehazed images by introducing a discriminator and a loss function adaptive to
hazy conditions; Third, we propose to remove notorious halo-like artifacts at
large scene depth discontinuities by a novel application of guided filtering.
Extensive experimental results have shown that the subjective qualities of
dehazed images by the proposed perceptually optimized GAN (POGAN) are often
more favorable than those by existing state-of-the-art approaches especially

(\textit{SDO}). The width and height of the cavity are 150$\arcsec$ and
240$\arcsec$, and the centroid of cavity is 128$\arcsec$ above the solar
surface. At $\sim$17:50 UT, a C3.8 two-ribbon flare took place in active region
11169 close to the solar western limb. Meanwhile, a partial halo coronal mass
ejection (CME) erupted and propagated at a linear speed of $\sim$682 km
s$^{-1}$. Associated with the eruption, a coronal extreme-ultraviolet (EUV)
wave was generated and propagated in the northeast direction at a speed of
$\sim$120 km s$^{-1}$. Once the EUV wave arrived at the cavity from the top, it
pushed the large-scale overlying magnetic field lines downward before bouncing
back. At the same time, the cavity started to oscillate coherently in the
vertical direction and lasted for $\sim$2 cycles before disappearing. The
amplitude, period, and damping time are 2.4$-$3.5 Mm, 29$-$37 minutes, and
26$-$78 minutes, respectively. The vertical oscillation of the cavity is
explained by a global standing MHD wave of fast kink mode. To estimate the
magnetic field strength of the cavity, we use two independent methods of
prominence seismology. It is found that the magnetic field strength is only a
few Gauss and less than 10 G.

on unlabeled raw pixels of image frames from an input video rather than

a water sample at six different excitation wavelengths ranging from 405 nm -
530 nm. A number of morphological and spectral fluorescence features are then
extracted from the isolated micro-organism imaging data, and used to train
neural network classification models designed for the purpose of identification
of the six algae types given an isolated micro-organism. Experimental results
using three different neural network classification models showed that the use
of either fluorescence-based spectral features or fluorescence-based
spectral-morphological features to train neural network classification models
led to statistically significant improvements in identification accuracy when
compared to the use of morphological features (with average identification
accuracies of 95.7%+/-3.5% and 96.1%+/-1.5%, respectively). These preliminary
results are quite promising, given that the identification accuracy of human
taxonomists are typically between the range of 67% and 83%, and thus

timelike separation if the strong Huygens principle holds, we then show that

simplifying the procurement of closed expressions. We demonstrate this for

gravitational phenomena. The magnitude and precise direction of this
""gravitational Magnus effect"" is still the subject of debate. Starting from the
rigorous equations of motion for spinning bodies in General Relativity
(Mathisson-Papapetrou equations), we show that indeed such an effect takes

whenever there is a current of mass/energy, non-parallel to a body's spin. We

new diagnosis based on the state-of-the-art density-matrix renormalization

for such a system at half-filling with three distinct phases. For weak
nearest-neighboring interactions, we demonstrate the instablity of the QBT
towards an interaction-driven spontaneous quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect.
For strong interactions, the system breaks the rotational symmetry realizing a
nematic charge-density-wave (CDW) phase. Interestingly, for intermediate
interactions we discover a symmetry-broken bond-ordered critical phase
sandwiched in between the QAH and CDW phases, which splits the QBT into two
Dirac points driven by interaction. Instead of the direct transition between
QAH and CDW phases, our identification of an intermediate phase shed new light
on the theoretical understanding of the interaction-driven phases in QBT

  The first results of the paper are Ramanujan-type congruences of the form
$p^{*k}(qn+r) \equiv_q 0$ and $\sigma^{*k}(qn+r) \equiv_q 0$, where $p(n)$ and
$\sigma(n)$ are the partition and divisor functions, $q > 3$ is prime, and
$^{*k}$ denotes $k^{th}$-order self-convolution. We prove all the valid
congruences of this form for $q \in \{5, 7, 11\}$, including the three
Ramanujan congruences, and a nontrivial one for $q = 17$. All such
multipartition congruences have already been settled in principle up to a
numerical verification due to D. Eichhorn and K. Ono via modular forms, but our
proofs are purely algebraic. On the other hand, the majority of the divisor
function congruences are new results.
  We then proceed to search for more general congruences modulo small primes,
concerning linear combinations of $\sigma^{*k}(pn+r)$ for different values of
$k$, as well as weighted convolutions of $p(n)$ and $\sigma(n)$ with polynomial
weights. The paper ends with a few corollaries and extensions for the divisor

generation, within which different subsets of terminals sharing secrets are

their secrecy capacity, i.e., the maximum rate of a secret key that can be
agreed upon by the entire set of terminals, is well-understood, what remains
open is the maximum rate of a secret key that can be generated when there is a
restriction on the overall rate of public discussion allowed. In this work, we
obtain a family of explicitly computable upper bounds on the number of bits of

further to the existing studies on text-to-image generation mainly focusing on
the object's appearance, the proposed method aims to generate an object image

controls both the object and background information jointly. As a core
component of MC-GAN, we propose a synthesis block which disentangles the object
and background information in the training stage. This block enables MC-GAN to
generate a realistic object image with the desired background by controlling
the amount of the background information from the given base image using the
foreground information from the text attributes. From the experiments with
Caltech-200 bird and Oxford-102 flower datasets, we show that our model is able
to generate photo-realistic images with a resolution of 128 x 128. The source

found that, due to the existence of gapless side surface states, QAHE is
protected even in the presence of magnetic disorders as long as the z-component
of magnetic moment of all magnetic dopants are positive. More importantly, such
magnetic disorders also suppress the dissipation of the chiral edge states and
enhance the quality of QAHE in MTI films. In addition, the effect of magnetic
disorders depends very much on the film thickness, and the optimal influence is
achieved at certain thickness. These findings are new features for QAHE in

luminosity function of the globular clusters at $20''<r<50''$, F606W (max)$_0=

The systematic error of this method can be as large as $\pm0.3$ mag. This value

proven itself to be difficult to parameterize in operational wave models.
Instead, we assume that there exists a self-similarity scaling law which
captures the first order properties. Using dimensional analysis, an equation
for the kinematic viscosity is derived which is proportional to the wave
frequency and the ice thickness squared. In addition, the model allows for a
two-layer structure where the oscillating pressure gradient due to wave
propagation only exists in a fraction of the total ice thickness. These two
assumptions lead to a spatial dissipation rate that is a function of ice
thickness and wavenumber. The derived dissipation rate compares favourably with

Upon observing the personalized information of each arriving customer, the firm
needs to set a price accordingly based on the covariates such as income,
education background, past purchasing history to extract more revenue. For new
entrants of the business, the lack of historical data may severely limit the
power and profitability of personalized pricing. We propose a nonparametric
pricing policy to simultaneously learn the preference of customers based on the
covariates and maximize the expected revenue over a finite horizon. The policy
does not depend on any prior assumptions on how the personalized information
affects consumers' preferences (such as linear models). It is adaptively splits
the covariate space into smaller bins (hyper-rectangles) and clusters customers
based on their covariates and preferences, offering similar prices for
customers who belong to the same cluster trading off granularity and accuracy.
We show that the algorithm achieves a regret of order $O(\log(T)^2

dimension of the covariate. It improves the current regret in the literature

context (smoothness and local concavity). We also prove that no policy can
achieve a regret less than $O(T^{(2+d)/(4+d)})$ for a particular instance and
thus demonstrate the near optimality of the proposed policy.

of using an operator that is optimal across an uncertainty class of systems as

MOCU-based experimental design selects an experiment to maximally reduce MOCU,
thereby gaining the greatest reduction of uncertainty impacting the operational
objective. The original formulation applied to finding optimal system
operators, where optimality is with respect to a cost function, such as
mean-square error; and the prior distribution governing the uncertainty class
relates directly to the underlying physical system. Here we provide a
generalized MOCU and the corresponding experimental design. We then demonstrate
how this new formulation includes as special cases MOCU-based experimental

MOSFETs with ferroelectric (FE) layers in the gate stacks or in series with the

framework of a FE polarization switching model. However, there is a large
amount of literature attributing this effect to a stabilization of quasi-static

stabilized non-switching (NS) QSNC model vs a FE switching model are vastly
different; the latter precluding applications to sub-60 mV/dec SS scaled CMOS
due to speed limitations and power dissipated in switching. In this letter, we
provide a thorough analysis assessing the foundations of models of QSNC,
identifying which specific assumptions (ansatz) may be unlikely or unphysical,
and analyzing their applicability. We show that it is not reasonable to expect
QSNC for two separate capacitors connected in series (with a metal plate
between dielectric (DE) and FE layers). We propose a model clarifying under
which conditions a QS ""apparent NC"" for a FE layer in a FE-DE bi-layer stack
may be observed, quantifying the requirements of strong interface polarization
coupling in addition to capacitance matching. In this regime, our model
suggests the FE layer does not behave as a NC layer, simply, the coupling leads
to both the DE and FE behaving as high-k DE with similar permittivities. This
may be useful for scaled EOT devices but does not lead to sub-60 mV/dec SS.

stars (NSs) using the information encoded in the X-ray pulse profiles of
accreting millisecond pulsars. We model the shape of the pulses using ""oblate
Schwarzschild"" approximation, which takes into account the deformed shape of
the star together with the special and general relativistic corrections to the
photon trajectories and angles. The spectrum of the radiation is obtained from
an empirical model of Comptonization in a hot slab in which a fraction of seed
blackbody photons is scattered into a power-law component. By using an
affine-invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo ensemble sampling method, we obtain
posterior probability distributions for the different model parameters,
especially for the mass and the radius. To test the robustness of our method,
we first analyzed self-generated synthetic data with known model parameters.
Similar analysis was then applied for the observations of SAX J1808.4-3658 by
the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The results show that our method can
reproduce the model parameters of the synthetic data, and that accurate
constraints for the radius can be obtained using the RXTE pulse profile
observations if the mass is a priori known. For a mass in the range 1.5-1.8
Msun, the radius of the NS in SAX J1808.4-3658 is constrained between 9 and 13
km. If the mass is accurately known, the radius can be determined with an
accuracy of 5% (68% credibility). For example, for the mass of 1.7 Msun the
equatorial radius is Req = 11.9+0.5 -0.4 km. Finally, we show that further
improvements can be obtained when the X-ray polarization data from the Imaging
X-ray Polarimeter Explorer will become available.

professional skills. In addition, an increasing push towards education that is
aligned with industry and incorporates industrial partners can be observed.
However, the involvement of external stakeholders in teaching moments can
create friction and could, in the worst case, lead to frustration of all
involved parties. Contribution: We developed a model that allows analysing the
involvement of external stakeholders in university courses both in a
retrospective fashion, to gain insights from past course instances, and in a
constructive fashion, to plan the involvement of external stakeholders. Key
Concepts: The conceptual model and the accompanying guideline guide the
teachers in their analysis of stakeholder involvement. The model is comprised
of several activities (define, execute, and evaluate the collaboration). The
guideline provides questions that the teachers should answer for each of these
activities. In the constructive use, the model allows teachers to define an
action plan based on an analysis of potential stakeholders and the pedagogical
objectives. In the retrospective use, the model allows teachers to identify
issues that appeared during the project and their underlying causes. Drawing
from ideas of the reflective practitioner, the model contains an emphasis on
reflection and interpretation of the observations made by the teacher and other
groups involved in the courses. Key Lessons: Applying the model retrospectively

implicit risks and assumptions and to gain a better insight into the

propose a novel superpixel-guided two-view geometric model fitting method

Specifically, SDF includes three main parts: a deterministic sampling
algorithm, a model hypothesis updating strategy and a novel model selection
algorithm. The proposed deterministic sampling algorithm generates a set of
initial model hypotheses according to the prior information of superpixels.
Then the proposed updating strategy further improves the quality of model
hypotheses. After that, by analyzing the properties of the updated model
hypotheses, the proposed model selection algorithm extends the conventional
""fit-and-remove"" framework to estimate model instances in multiple-structure
data. The three parts are tightly coupled to boost the performance of SDF in
both speed and accuracy, and SDF has the deterministic nature. Experimental
results show that the proposed SDF has significant advantages over several
state-of-the-art fitting methods when it is applied to real images with

important for estimate the uncertainties when using clusters as cosmological
probes. In this paper, we study the centre offsets $r_{\rm off}$ between the
gas and that of all the matter within halo systems in $\Lambda$CDM cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on two kinds of centre offsets: one is the
three-dimensional PB offsets between the gravitational potential minimum of the
entire halo and the barycentre of the ICM, and the other is the two-dimensional
PX offsets between the potential minimum of the halo and the iterative centroid
of the projected synthetic X-ray emission of the halo. Halos at higher
redshifts tend to have larger values of rescaled offsets $r_{\rm off}/r_{200}$
and larger gas velocity dispersion $\sigma_{v}^{\rm gas}/\sigma_{200}$. For
both types of offsets, we find that the correlation between the rescaled centre
offsets $r_{\rm off}/r_{200}$ and the rescaled 3D gas velocity dispersion,
$\sigma_v^{\rm gas}/\sigma_{200}$ can be approximately described by a quadratic
function as $r_{{\rm off}}/r_{200} \propto (\sigma_{v}^{\rm gas}/\sigma_{200} -

for a generic equisingular deformation of an isolated plane curve singularity
germ to study how the set of $b$-exponents depends on the topology of the

distributed and service-based systems whereby each microservice is highly
cohesive and implements a single business capability. A microservice system
consists of multiple, loosely coupled microservices. It provides complex
capabilities through services interacting in choreographies. A single dedicated
team, typically practicing DevOps, is responsible for each microservice, i.e.,
it ""owns"" the service. However, while systems relying on MSA have several
architectural advantages especially for cloud applications, their realization
is characterized by an increased accidental complexity due to redundant
handcrafting of implementation, e.g., to make each service standalone runnable.
A promising way to cope with such complexity is the usage of Model-driven
Development (MDD) whereby models are used as first-class entities in the
software development process. Although there are already first steps taken on
how MDD could be applied by a single team to implement its microservices, the
question of how MDD can be adapted to MSA's development distribution across
multiple teams remains an issue. In this paper we envision the application of
Collaborative Model-driven Software Engineering (CMDSE) to MDD of MSA by
surveying relevant characteristics of CMDSE and identifying challenges for its
application to MSA. The present paper takes a first step towards enabling
holistic MDD of MSA across microservice teams.

"1805.01178","Albert Visser","Albert Visser","The Small-Is-Very-Small Principle",,,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The central result of this paper is the small-is-very-small principle for
restricted sequential theories. The principle says roughly that whenever the
given theory shows that a property has a small witness, i.e. a witness in every
definable cut, then it shows that the property has a very small witness: i.e. a
witness below a given standard number.
  We draw various consequences from the central result. For example (in rough
formulations): (i) Every restricted, recursively enumerable sequential theory
has a finitely axiomatized extension that is conservative w.r.t. formulas of
complexity $\leq n$. (ii) Every sequential model has, for any $n$, an extension
that is elementary for formulas of complexity $\leq n$, in which the
intersection of all definable cuts is the natural numbers. (iii) We have
reflection for $\Sigma^0_2$-sentences with sufficiently small witness in any
consistent restricted theory $U$. (iv) Suppose $U$ is recursively enumerable
and sequential. Suppose further that every recursively enumerable and
sequential $V$ that locally inteprets $U$, globally interprets $U$. Then, $U$
is mutually globally interpretable with a finitely axiomatized sequential
theory.
  The paper contains some careful groundwork developing partial satisfaction
predicates in sequential theories for the complexity measure depth of
quantifier alternations.

picture of both the velocity field and the density field. Experimentally, this
represents a significant measurement challenge, especially when full
three-dimensional data is needed to accurately characterise the turbulent
fields. This paper presents a new approach to obtaining such data through
well-resolved, near-instantaneous volume-spanning measurements. This is
accomplished by rapidly scanning the volume with a light sheet so that, at each
scan location, planar two-dimensional measurements of three velocity components
via stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) and simultaneous density
information via planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) can be made.
Ultimately, this rapid scanning technique permits the measurement of all three
components of velocity in a volume as well as simultaneously capturing the
three-dimensional density field. The scanning of the light sheet is
accomplished by mounting the optics producing the light sheet on a linear
traverse that is capable of rapidly scanning the volume in a continuous manner.
The key and novel aspect enabling high scan rates is the addition of two
mirrors on galvanometers to make small adjustments to the position of the light
sheet and ensure a precise overlap between pairs of image frames. This new
technique means the light sheet does not have to be excessively thick, the
scanning speed too slow, or that inappropriately small interframe times have to
be used, while ensuring overlapping particle patterns between pairs of images
that are required by the PIV algorithm. The technique is illustrated with some
preliminary results from the buoyancy-driven exchange flow through an inclined
duct connecting two reservoirs containing different density fluids.

electrons flowing from the n region can be focused at the symmetric position in
the p region, acting as a perfect Veselago lens, regardless whether the
incident energy is within or beyond the bulk energy gap. In the former case,
the focusing effect occurs only in the surfaces. While in the latter case, the
focusing effect occurs beyond the surfaces. These results show that the
focusing effect of electron flow is a general phenomenon. It means the negative
refraction may arise in all materials that are described by the massive or
massless Dirac equation of 2D or beyond 2D system. Furthermore, we also find
the focusing effect is robust in resisting the moderate random disorders.
Finally, in the presence of a weak perpendicular magnetic field, the focusing
effect remains well except that the position of the focal point is deflected by
the transverse Lorentz force. Due to the finite size effect, the position of
focal point oscillates periodically with a period of Delta B.

(~0.4'') for a sample of 20 well-known high-mass star-forming regions with
distances below 5.5kpc and luminosities larger than 10^4Lsun.
  Results: We present the overall survey scope, the selected sample, the
observational setup and the main goals of CORE. Scientifically, we concentrate
on the mm continuum emission on scales on the order of 1000AU. We detect strong
mm continuum emission from all regions, mostly due to the emission from cold
dust. The fragmentation properties of the sample are diverse. We see extremes
where some regions are dominated by a single high-mass core whereas others
fragment into as many as 20 cores. A minimum-spanning-tree analysis finds
fragmentation at scales on the order of the thermal Jeans length or smaller
suggesting that turbulent fragmentation is less important than thermal
gravitational fragmentation. The diversity of highly fragmented versus singular
regions can be explained by varying initial density structures and/or different
initial magnetic field strengths.
  Conclusions: The smallest observed separations between cores are found around
the angular resolution limit which indicates that further fragmentation likely
takes place on even smaller spatial scales. The CORE project with its numerous
spectral line detections will address a diverse set of important physical and

theoretical studies of the major reactive collisions in these environments are

electrons and molecular ions result in recombination and vibrational
excitation, the rates of these processes being particularly elevated due to the
high charged particle densities in the inner region. This work addresses the
dissociative recombination, vibrational excitation, and vibrational
de-excitation of electrons with CO$^+$ molecular cations. The aim of this study
is to understand the importance of these reactive collisions in producing
carbon and oxygen atoms in cometary activity. The cross-section calculations
were based on Multichannel Quantum Defect Theory. The molecular data sets, used
here to take into account the nuclear dynamics, were based on ab initio
R-matrix approach. The cross sections for the dissociative recombination,
vibrational excitation, and vibrational de-excitation processes, for the six
lowest vibrational levels of CO$^+$ - relevant for the electronic temperatures
observed in comets - are computed, as well as their corresponding Maxwell rate
coefficients. Moreover, final state distributions for different dissociation
pathways are presented. Among all reactive collisions taking place between
low-energy electrons and CO$^+$, the dissociative recombination is the most
important process at electronic temperatures characterizing the comets. We have
shown that this process can be a major source of O($^3$P), O($^1$D), O($^1$S),
C($^3$P) and C($^1$D) produced in the cometary coma at small cometocentric

To
enhance the label relatedness captured by the embeddings, multiple contexts can

Heterogeneous Context Label Embedding (PHCLE) framework to address these

shared embedding principle across heterogeneous contexts, the label relatedness
is selectively aligned in a shared space. Due to our elegant formulation, PHCLE
overcomes the partial context problem and can nicely incorporate more contexts,
which both cannot be tackled with existing multi-context label embedding
methods. An effective alternative optimization algorithm is further derived to
solve the sparse matrix factorization problem. Experimental results demonstrate
that the label embeddings obtained with PHCLE achieve superb performance in

set out to re-analyze data acquired by the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer

new approach to SSO detection via parallactic fitting. Using the heliocentric

all data stem from an object. The fact that the orbit of a distant SSO is
approximately linear in heliocentric coordinates over long time-scales can be
utilized to produce candidates, which can then be confirmed with follow-up
observations. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by a posteriori
detecting the outer SSO Makemake within WISE data. An all-sky search for Planet
Nine yielded no detection. While the postulated Planet Nine eluded detection by
our algorithm, we tentatively predict that this new approach to moving-object
analysis will enable the discovery of new distant SSOs that cannot be
discovered by other algorithms. Especially in cases of sparse data observed

nuclei through reactions. By taking the ratio of angular distributions for two
processes, viz. breakup and elastic scattering, this new observable is nearly
independent of the reaction mechanism and hence much more sensitive to the
projectile structure than the cross sections for each single process. We study
the extension of the ratio method to proton-rich nuclei and also explore the
optimum experimental conditions for measuring this new observable. We compare
accurate dynamical calculations of reactions for proton-rich projectiles to the
prediction of the ratio method. We use the dynamical eikonal approximation that
provides good results for this kind of reactions at intermediate energy. Our
tests for 8B, an archteypical one-proton halo nucleus, on Pb, Ni, and C targets
at 44 MeV/nucleon show that, the ratio works less well than for neutron halos
due to the non-negligible Coulomb interaction between the valence proton and
the target. Nevertheless, the ratio method still provides pertinent information
about nuclear structure on the proton-rich side of the valley of stability.
Interestingly the method is not affected if energy ranges-or bins-are
considered in the projectile continuum. This makes the ratio easier to measure
experimentally by increasing the breakup cross section. We also extend our
analysis to 17F, 25Al, and 27P, whose study is of interest to both nuclear
astrophysics and nuclear structure. We show that, albeit less precise than for
one-neutron halo nuclei, nuclear-structure information can be inferred from the
ratio method applied to exotic proton-rich nuclei. In particular, when the
valence proton is loosely bound in an $s$ or $p$ orbital, viz. for proton halo
nuclei, detailed structure information can be obtained through this new
reaction observable.

we focus on the local dynamics regime. The local dynamics differ from the
well-studied case of 2D turbulence as it allows to consider the true
thermodynamic limit. This limit is not defined for 2D turbulence. We show an
analytical form of the probability density distribution of the velocity
fluctuations for different degrees of locality. The central region of the
distribution is not Gaussian, in contrast to the case of 2D turbulence, but can
be approximated with a Gaussian function in the small velocity limit. The tails
of the distribution exhibit a power law behavior and self similarity in terms
of the density variable. Due to the thermodynamic limit, both the Gaussian
approximation for the core and the steepness of the tails are independent on
the number of point vortices, but depend on the {\alpha}-model. We also show
the connection between the velocity statistics for point vortices uniformly
distributed, in the context of the {\alpha}-model in classical turbulence, with
the velocity statistics for point vortices non-uniformly distributed. Since the
exponent of the power law depends just on {\alpha}, we test the power law
approximation obtained with the point vortex approximation, by simulating full
turbulent fields for different values of {\alpha} and we compute the

from the oxygen abundance in O3N2. We also find that type II and type Ibc SNe
arise from progenitor stars of similar age, mostly from 7 to 45 Myr, which
corresponds to stars with masses < 20 solar mass . However these two types SNe
have little preference in their host environment metallicity measured by oxygen
abundance or in progenitor initial mass. We note however that at lower
metallicities supernovae are more likely to be of type II.

power optimization for a multi-hop ad-hoc network under the existence of
randomly distributed eavesdroppers following a Poisson point process (PPP).
Secrecy messages are delivered from a source to a destination through a
multi-hop route connected by multiple legitimate relays in the network. Our
goal is to minimize the end-to-end connection outage probability (COP) under
the constraint of a secrecy outage probability (SOP) threshold, by optimizing
the routing path and the transmit power of each hop jointly. We show that the
globally optimal solution could be obtained by a two-step procedure where the
optimal transmit power has a closed-form and the optimal routing path can be
found by Dijkstra's algorithm. Then a friendly jammer with multiple antennas is
applied to enhance the secrecy performance further, and the optimal transmit
power of the jammer and each hop of the selected route is investigated. This
problem can be solved optimally via an iterative outer polyblock approximation
with one-dimension search algorithm. Furthermore, suboptimal transmit powers
can be derived using the successive convex approximation (SCA) method with a
lower complexity. Simulation results show the performance improvement of the
proposed algorithms for both non-jamming and jamming scenarios, and also reveal
a non-trivial trade-off between the numbers of hops and the transmit power of
each hop for secure routing.

attraction, at present epoch, whereas standard gravity is dominant at small
scales. As a consequence, there exists a \emph{point} where the effects are
counterbalanced, dubbed \emph{turnaround radius}, $r_{\text{ta}}$. By
construction, it provides a bound on maximum structure sizes of the observed
universe. Once an upper bound on $r_{\text{ta}}$ is provided, i.e.
$R_{\text{TA,max}}$, one can check whether cosmological models guarantee
structure formation. Here, we focus on $f(R)$ gravity, without imposing \emph{a
priori} the form of $f(R)$. We thus provide an analytic expression for the
turnaround radius in the framework of $f(R)$ models. To figure this out, we
compute the turnaround radius in two distinct cases: 1) under the hypothesis of
static and spherically symmetric space-time, and 2) by using the cosmological
perturbation theory. We thus find a criterion to enable large scale structures
to be stable in $f(R)$ models, circumscribing the class of $f(R)$ theories as
suitable alternative to dark energy. In particular, we get that for constant
curvature, the viability condition becomes $R_{\text{dS}}f'(R_{\text{dS}}) \leq
5.48 \Lambda \Rightarrow f'(R_{\text{dS}}) \leq 1.37$, with $\Lambda$ and
$R_{\text{dS}}$ respectively the observed cosmological constant and the Ricci
curvature. This prescription rules out models which do not pass the
aforementioned $R_{\text{TA,max}}$ limit.

strong compared to the inter-species interaction between the impurities and the

anisotropic, with theories of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence explaining
the anisotropy through a preferred magnetic field direction throughout the
scattering regions. In particular, the line of sight to the Galactic Center
supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, exhibits strong and anisotropic scattering,
which dominates its observed size at wavelengths of a few millimeters and
longer. Therefore, inferences of the intrinsic structure of \sgra\ at these
wavelengths are sensitive to the assumed scattering model. In addition,
extrapolations of the scattering model from long wavelengths, at which its
parameters are usually estimated, to 1.3 mm, where the Event Horizon Telescope
(EHT) seeks to image Sgr A* on Schwarzschild-radius scales, are also sensitive
to the assumed scattering model. Past studies of Sgr A* have relied on simple
Gaussian models for the scattering kernel that effectively presume an inner
scale of turbulence far greater than the diffractive scale; this assumption is
likely violated for Sgr A* at 1.3 mm. We develop a physically motivated model
for anisotropic scattering, using a simplified model for MHD turbulence with a
finite inner scale and a wandering transverse magnetic field direction. We
explore several explicit analytic models for this wandering and derive the
expected observational properties --- scatter broadening and refractive
scintillation --- for each. For expected values of the inner scale, the
scattering kernel for all models is markedly non-Gaussian at 1.3 mm but is
straightforward to calculate and depends only weakly on the assumed model for
the wandering of the magnetic field direction. On the other hand, in all
models, the refractive substructure depends strongly on the wandering model and
may be an important consideration in imaging Sgr A* with the EHT.

recently emerged as novel 2D components for nanoscale electronics and
optoelectronics. The properties of such materials are intimately related to
their structure and dimensionality. For example, only the edges exposed by MoS2
nanoparticles (NPs) are catalytically active, and extended MoS2 systems show
different character (direct or indirect gap semiconducting, or metallic)
depending on their thickness and crystallographic phase. In this work, we show
how particle size and interaction with a metal surface affect the stability and
properties of different MoS2 NPs and the resulting phase diagrams. By means of
calculations based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT), we address how
support interactions affect MoS2 nanoparticles of varying size, composition,
and structure. We demonstrate that interaction with Au modifies the relative
stability of the different nanoparticle types so that edge terminations and
crystallographic phases that are metastable for free-standing nanoparticles and
monolayers are expressed in the supported system. These support-effects are
strongly size-dependent due to the mismatch between Au and MoS2 lattices, which
explains experimentally observed transitions in the structural phases for
supported MoS2 NPs. Accounting for vdW interactions and the contraction of the
Au(111) surface underneath the MoS2 is further found to be necessary for
quantitatively reproducing experimental results. This work demonstrates how the
properties of nanostructured MoS2 and similar layered systems can be modified

and dense small cell BSs are deployed. We analytically estimate BER performance
of UL decoded data, which are used to derive an approximated normalized mean
square error (NMSE) expression of the DA minimum mean square error (MMSE)
estimator. Compared with the conventional least square (LS) and MMSE, it is
shown that NMSE performances of all estimators are determined by their
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-like terms and there is an increment consisting of
UL data power, UL data length and BER values in the SNR-like term of DA method,
which suggests DA method outperforms the conventional ones in any scenarios.
Higher UL data power, longer UL data length and better BER performance lead to
more accurate estimated channels with DA method. Numerical results verify that
the analytical BER and NMSE results are close to the simulated ones and a
remarkable gain in both NMSE and DL rate can be achieved by DA method in

dynamos being excited at small and intermediate ratios of viscosity to magnetic
diffusivity (the magnetic Prandtl number) has been debated, and the possibility
of them depending on the large-scale forcing wavenumber has been raised. Here
we show, using four values of the forcing wavenumber, that the small-scale
dynamo does not depend on the scale-separation between the size of the
simulation domain and the integral scale of the turbulence, i.e., the forcing
scale. Moreover, the spectral bottleneck in turbulence, which has been implied
as being responsible for raising the excitation conditions of small-scale
dynamos, is found to be invariant under changing the forcing wavenumber.
However, when forcing at the lowest few wavenumbers, the effective forcing
wavenumber that enters in the definition of the magnetic Reynolds number is
found to be about twice the minimum wavenumber of the domain. Our work is
relevant to future studies of small-scale dynamos, of which several
applications are being discussed.

feature in the sky-averaged radio spectrum around 78 MHz, as may result from
absorption in the 21 cm line by neutral hydrogen at z~15-20. If confirmed, one
implication is that the spin temperature of the 21 cm line is coupled to the
gas temperature by z=20. The known mechanism for accomplishing this is the
Wouthuysen-Field effect, whereby Lyman-alpha photons scatter in the
intergalactic medium (IGM) and impact the hyperfine level populations. This
suggests that early star formation had already produced a copious Lyman-alpha
background by z=20, and strongly constrains models in which the linear matter
power spectrum is suppressed on small-scales, since halo and star formation are
delayed in such scenarios. Here we consider the case that the dark matter
consists of ultra-light axions with macroscopic de Broglie wavelengths (fuzzy
dark matter, FDM). We assume that star formation tracks halo formation and
adopt two simple models from the current literature for the halo mass function
in FDM. We further suppose that the fraction of halo baryons which form stars
is less than a conservative upper limit of $f_\star \leq 0.05$, and that ~10^4
Lyman-alpha to Lyman-limit photons are produced per stellar baryon. We find
that the requirement that the 21 cm spin temperature is coupled to the gas
temperature by $z=20$ places a lower-limit on the FDM particle mass of $m_a
\geq 5 \times 10^{-21} {\rm eV}$. The constraint is insensitive to the precise
minimum mass of halos where stars form. As the global 21 cm measurements are
refined, the coupling redshift could change and we quantify how the FDM
constraint would be modified. A rough translation of the FDM mass bound to a
thermal relic warm dark matter (WDM) mass bound is also provided.

applied to other similar tasks.

neurological disease. However, opportunities to optimize such therapies are
challenged by the fact that the beneficial impact of focal stimulation on both
neighboring and distant regions is not well understood. Here, we use network
control theory to build a model of brain network function that makes
predictions about how stimulation spreads through the brain's white matter
network and influences large-scale dynamics. We test these predictions using
combined electrocorticography (ECoG) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data
who volunteered to participate in an extensive stimulation regimen. We posit a
specific model-based manner in which white matter tracts constrain stimulation,
defining its capacity to drive the brain to new states, including states
associated with successful memory encoding. In a first validation of our model,
we find that the true pattern of white matter tracts can be used to more
accurately predict the state transitions induced by direct electrical
stimulation than the artificial patterns of null models. We then use a targeted
optimal control framework to solve for the optimal energy required to drive the
brain to a given state. We show that, intuitively, our model predicts larger
energy requirements when starting from states that are farther away from a
target memory state. We then suggest testable hypotheses about which structural
properties will lead to efficient stimulation for improving memory based on
energy requirements. Our work demonstrates that individual white matter
architecture plays a vital role in guiding the dynamics of direct electrical
stimulation, more generally offering empirical support for the utility of
network control theoretic models of brain response to stimulation.

magnetically confined plasmas has been constructed based on a super-position of
uncorrelated pulses arriving according to a Poisson process. In the most common
applications of the model, the pulse amplitudes are assumed exponentially
distributed, supported by conditional averaging of large-amplitude fluctuations
in experimental measurement data. This basic assumption has two potential
limitations. First, statistical analysis of measurement data using conditional
averaging only reveals the tail of the amplitude distribution to be
exponentially distributed. Second, exponentially distributed amplitudes leads
to a positive definite signal which cannot capture fluctuations in for example
electric potential and radial velocity. Assuming pulse amplitudes which are not
positive definite often make finding a closed form for the probability density
function difficult, even if the characteristic function remains relatively
simple. Thus estimating model parameters requires an approach based on the
characteristic function, not the probability density function. In this
contribution, the effect of changing the amplitude distribution on the moments,
probability density function and characteristic function of the process is
investigated and a parameter estimation method using the empirical distribution
function is presented and tested on synthetically generated data. This proves
valuable for describing intermittent fluctuations in the boundary region of
magnetized plasmas.

systematically varying the explosion energy and the binary properties, we are
able to explore the effects that the companion has on redistributing the
angular momentum of the system. We find that, unlike the mass, the spin of the
newly formed BH varies only slightly with the currently theoretically
unconstrained energy of the SN and is primarily determined by the initial
binary separation. In contrast, variations in the initial binary separation
yield sizable changes on the resultant effective spin of the system. This
implies that the formation pathways of LIGO sources leading to a particular

study population was player-seasons from 2007-2016. We included regular season,
non-illness, non-head, game-loss injuries. Injuries were identified using a
database from Football Outsiders. The primary outcomes were overall,
conditioning-dependent and non-conditioning-dependent injury counts by season.
We examined time trends in injury counts before (2007-2010) and after
(2011-2016) the CBA using a Poisson interrupted time series model. The number
of game-loss regular season, non-head, non-illness injuries grew from 701 in
2007 to 804 in 2016 (15% increase). The number of regular season weeks missed
exhibited a similar increase. Conditioning-dependent injuries increased from
197 in 2007 to 271 in 2011 (38% rise), but were lower and remained relatively
unchanged at 220-240 injuries per season thereafter. Non-conditioning injuries
decreased by 37% in the first three years of the new CBA before returning to
historic levels in 2014-2016. Poisson models for all, conditioning-dependent,
and non-conditioning-dependent game-loss injury counts did not show
statistically significant or meaningful detrimental changes associated with the

then calculated to high orders ($n \leq 10$) in a systematic series of

al. 2014), and relative frequencies of the various neuronal responses are best
modeled by the sparse coding approach. We conclude that the optic flow neurons
in the zebrafish pretectum do reflect the optic flow statistics. The predicted
vectorial receptive fields show typical optic flow fields but also ""Gabor"" and
dipole-shaped patterns that likely reflect difference fields needed for
reconstruction by linear superposition.

the pretopology theoretical formalism. Our proposal is first to define the
pseudo-closure operator (modeling the propagation concept) as a logical
combination of neighborhoods. We show that learning such an operator lapses
into the Multiple Instance (MI) framework, where the learning process is
performed on bags of instances instead of individual instances. Though this
framework is well suited for this task, its use for learning a pretopological
space leads to a set of bags exponential in size. To overcome this issue we
thus propose a learning method based on a low estimation of the bags covered by
a concept under construction. As an experiment, percolation processes (forest
fires typically) are simulated and the corresponding propagation models are
learned based on a subset of observations. It reveals that the proposed MI
approach is significantly more efficient on the task of propagation model
recognition than existing methods.

planets via the radial velocity (RV) technique. Aims. We attempt to
definitively discriminate the nature of the RV variations for the young active
K5 star BD+20 1790, for which visible (VIS) RV measurements show divergent
results on the existence of a substellar companion. Methods. We compare VIS
data with high precision RVs in the near infrared (NIR) range by using the
GIANO - B and IGRINS spectrographs. In addition, we present for the first time
simultaneous VIS-NIR observations obtained with GIARPS (GIANO - B and HARPS -
N) at Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). Orbital RVs are achromatic, so the RV
amplitude does not change at different wavelengths, while stellar activity
induces wavelength-dependent RV variations, which are significantly reduced in
the NIR range with respect to the VIS. Results. The NIR radial velocity
measurements from GIANO - B and IGRINS show an average amplitude of about one
quarter with respect to previously published VIS data, as expected when the RV
jitter is due to stellar activity. Coeval multi-band photometry surprisingly
shows larger amplitudes in the NIR range, explainable with a mixture of cool
and hot spots in the same active region. Conclusions. In this work, the claimed
massive planet around BD+20 1790 is ruled out by our data. We exploited the
crucial role of multi- wavelength spectroscopy when observing young active
stars: thanks to facilities like GIARPS that provide simultaneous observations,
this method can reach its maximum potential.

variety of computer vision tasks, including facial attribute classification.
The great success of classifying facial attributes with DNN often relies on a
massive amount of labelled data. However, in real-world applications, labelled
data are only provided for some commonly used attributes (such as age, gender);
whereas, unlabelled data are available for other attributes (such as
attraction, hairline). To address the above problem, we propose a novel deep
transfer neural network method based on multi-label learning for facial
attribute classification, termed FMTNet, which consists of three sub-networks:
the Face detection Network (FNet), the Multi-label learning Network (MNet) and
the Transfer learning Network (TNet). Firstly, based on the Faster Region-based
Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), FNet is fine-tuned for face
detection. Then, MNet is fine-tuned by FNet to predict multiple attributes with
labelled data, where an effective loss weight scheme is developed to explicitly
exploit the correlation between facial attributes based on attribute grouping.
Finally, based on MNet, TNet is trained by taking advantage of unsupervised
domain adaptation for unlabelled facial attribute classification. The three
sub-networks are tightly coupled to perform effective facial attribute
classification. A distinguishing characteristic of the proposed FMTNet method
is that the three sub-networks (FNet, MNet and TNet) are constructed in a
similar network structure. Extensive experimental results on challenging face
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with
several state-of-the-art methods.

in high-dimensional linear regression models when the complete data are not
accessible, but only certain marginal information or summary statistics are
available. This problem is motivated from the Genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) that have been widely used to identify risk variants underlying complex
human traits/diseases. With a large number of completed GWAS, statistical
methods using summary statistics become more and more important because of
restricted accessibility to individual-level data sets. Theoretically
guaranteed methods are highly demanding to advance the statistical inference
with a large amount of available marginal information. Here we propose an
$\ell_1$ penalized approach, REMI, to estimate high dimensional regression
coefficients with marginal information and external reference samples. We
establish an upper bound on the error of the REMI estimator, which has the same
order as that of the minimax error bound of Lasso with complete
individual-level data. In particular, when marginal information is obtained
from a large number of samples together with a small number of reference
samples, REMI yields good estimation and prediction results, and outperforms
the Lasso because the sample size of accessible individual-level data can be
limited. Through simulation studies and real data analysis of the NFBC1966 GWAS
data set, we demonstrate that REMI can be widely applicable. The developed R

attention in the computer vision community. Great progress has been made along
with the availability of challenging FAC datasets. However, conventional FAC
methods usually firstly pre-process the input images (i.e., perform face
detection and alignment) and then predict facial attributes. These methods
ignore the inherent dependencies among these tasks (i.e., face detection,
facial landmark localization and FAC). Moreover, some methods using
convolutional neural network are trained based on the fixed loss weights
without considering the differences between facial attributes. In order to
address the above problems, we propose a novel multi-task learning of cas-
caded convolutional neural network method, termed MCFA, for predicting multiple
facial attributes simultaneously. Specifically, the proposed method takes
advantage of three cascaded sub-networks (i.e., S_Net, M_Net and L_Net

multiple tasks in a coarse-to-fine manner, which can achieve end-to-end

algorithm is proposed. From the articles available, most papers discuss convex
combinations of adaptive-filter algorithms focusing on the time domain. Those
algorithms show better performances in convergence speed and steady-state
error. The major defect of those algorithms, however, is the computational
complexity. To deal with this problem and motivated by frequency-domain
adaptive filters (FDAF) and convex optimization, this paper gives an adaptive
filter algorithm, that consists of combining the two FDAFs using the convex
combination principles and derives a formula to update the mixing parameter.
The computational complexity of the COSFDAF is analyzed theoretically. The
simulation results show that no matter what kinds of signal to be processed,
whether correlated (i.e. colored noise) or uncorrelated (i.e. white noise), the
proposed algorithm has better performance in identify the unknown coefficients
when compared to a single overlap-save FDAF or the convex combination of two
time-domain adaptive filters.

hitting sets of a hypergraph. It is a long-standing open question whether this
can be done in output-polynomial time. For hypergraphs whose solutions have
bounded size, Eiter and Gottlob [SICOMP 1995] gave an algorithm that runs in
output-polynomial time, but whose space requirement also scales with the output
size. We improve this to polynomial delay and polynomial space. More generally,
we present an algorithm that on $n$-vertex, $m$-edge hypergraphs has delay
$O(m^{k^*+1} n^2)$ and uses $O(mn)$ space, where $k^*$ is the maximum size of
any minimal hitting set. Our algorithm is oblivious to $k^*$, a quantity that
is hard to compute or even approximate.
  Central to our approach is the extension problem for minimal hitting sets,
deciding for a set $X$ of vertices whether it is contained in any solution.
With $|X|$ as parameter, we show that this is one of the first natural problems
to be complete for the complexity class $W[3]$. We give an algorithm for the
extension problem running in time $O(m^{|X|+1} n)$. We also prove a conditional
lower bound under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, showing that this is
close to optimal.
  We apply our enumeration method to the discovery problem of minimal unique
column combinations from data profiling. Our empirical evaluation suggests that
the algorithm outperforms its worst-case guarantees on hypergraphs stemming

over resources of varying quality. The motivating example is a group of animals
that disperse over patches of food of different abundances. In such scenarios,
individuals are biased towards selecting the higher quality patches, while, at
the same time, aiming to avoid costly collisions or overlaps. Our goal is to
investigate the impact of collision costs on the parallel coverage of resources
by the whole group. Consider M sites, where a site x has value f(x). We think
of f(x) as the reward associated with site x, and assume that if a single
individual visits x exclusively, it receives this exact reward. Typically, we
assume that if > 1 individuals visit x then each receives at most f(x). In
particular, when competition costs are high, each individual might receive an
amount strictly less than f(x), which could even be negative. Conversely,
modeling cooperation at a site, we also consider cases where each one gets more
than f(x). There are k identical players that compete over the rewards. They
independently act in parallel, in a one-shot scenario, each specifying a single
site to visit, without knowing which sites are explored by others. The group
performance is evaluated by the expected coverage, defined as the sum of f(x)
over all sites that are explored by at least one player. Since we assume that
players cannot coordinate before choosing their site we focus on symmetric
strategies. The main takeaway message of this paper is that the optimal
symmetric coverage is expected to emerge when collision costs are relatively
high, so that the following ""Judgment of Solomon"" type of rule holds: If a
single player explores a site x then it gains its full reward f(x), but if
several players explore it, then neither one receives any reward. Under this
policy, it turns out that there exists a unique symmetric Nash Equilibrium
strategy, which is, in fact, evolutionary stable. Moreover, this strategy
yields the best possible coverage among all symmetric strategies. Viewing the
coverage measure as the social welfare, this policy thus enjoys a (Symmetric)
Price of Anarchy of precisely 1, whereas, in fact, any other congestion policy
has a price strictly greater than 1. Our model falls within the scope of
mechanism design, and more precisely in the area of incentivizing exploration.
It finds relevance in evolutionary ecology, and further connects to studies on
Bayesian parallel search algorithms.

  ALE method for large structural displacements",,,,,"math.NA physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Venous valves are bicuspidal valves that ensure that blood in veins only
flows back to the heart. To prevent retrograde blood flow, the two intraluminal
leaflets meet in the center of the vein and occlude the vessel. In
fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations of venous valves, the large
structural displacements may lead to mesh deteriorations and entanglements,
causing instabilities of the solver and, consequently, the numerical solution
to diverge. In this paper, we propose an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)
scheme for FSI simulations designed to solve these instabilities. A monolithic
formulation for the FSI problem is considered and, due to the complexity of the
operators, the exact Jacobian matrix is evaluated using automatic
differentiation. The method relies on the introduction of a staggered in time
velocity %in the discretization scheme to improve stability, and on fictitious
springs to model the contact force of the valve leaflets. Since the large
structural displacements may compromise the quality of the fluid mesh as well,
a smoother fluid displacement, obtained with the introduction of a scaling
factor that measures the distance of a fluid element from the valve leaflet
tip, guarantees that there are no mesh entanglements in the fluid domain. To
further improve stability, a Streamline Upwind Petrov Galerkin (SUPG) method is
employed. The proposed ALE scheme is applied to a 2D model of a venous valve.
The presented simulations show that the proposed method deals well with the
large structural displacements of the problem, allowing a reconstruction of the
valve behavior in both the opening and closing phase.

sake of convenience, the three direction choices are respectively called
destination direction, following direction and detour direction in this paper.
Here, it is found that the featured direction choices could be inspired by the
shape characteristics of Voronoi diagram. To be specific, in the Voronoi cell
of a pedestrian, the direction to a Voronoi node is regarded as a potential
""detour"" direction, and the direction perpendicular to a Voronoi link is
regarded as a potential ""following"" direction. A pedestrian generally owns
several alternative Voronoi nodes and Voronoi links in a Voronoi cell, and the
optimal detour and following direction are determined by considering related
factors such as deviation. Plus the destination direction which is directly
pointing to the destination, the three basic direction choices are defined in a
Voronoi cell. In order to evaluate the Voronoi diagram based basic directions,
the empirical trajectory data in both uni- and bi-directional flow experiments
are extracted. A time series method considering the step frequency is used to
reduce the original trajectories' swaying phenomena which might disturb the
recognition of actual forward direction. The deviations between the empirical
velocity direction and the basic directions are investigated, and each velocity
direction is classified into a basic direction or regarded as an inexplicable
direction according to the deviations. The analysis results show that each
basic direction could be a potential direction choice for a pedestrian. The
combination of the three basic directions could cover most empirical velocity
direction choices in both uni- and bi-directional flow experiments.

$U_\chi(\mathfrak g)$-modules of dimension $p^{d_\chi}$. As a consequence, we
deduce that they are all parabolically induced from a 1-dimensional module for
$U_0(\mathfrak h)$ for a certain Levi subalgebra $\mathfrak h$ of $\mathfrak

primitive ideals in $U(\mathfrak{gl}_N(\mathbb C))$. To obtain these results,
we reduce to the case $\chi$ is nilpotent, and then classify the 1-dimensional
modules for the corresponding restricted $W$-algebra.

to print samples with known defects, in order to characterise the relative
effects of different variables on the Lock-In phase data. Samples were printed
using ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) and PLA (Polylactic Acid) for
comparisons, and variables such as print direction, cameras, heating power,
Lock-In frequency, as well as thickness, width and depth of defects were
explored. It was found that different materials resulted in different
baselines, but had similar phase contrast. A novel asynchronous technique was
derived to enable Lock-In measurements with 5 different infrared cameras, and
similar results were found. Even cheap cameras like the Seek Thermal CompactXR
were proven capable of detecting the same defects as other cameras such as the
FLIR SC7500. Heating power did not affect phase contrast, except for shallower
defects up to 1.0 mm deep, where higher power resulted in better contrast. As
expected, deeper defects could only be detected using lower Lock-In
frequencies, and there was better phase contrast with wider, thicker and
shallower defects. It was shown that defects 4 mm in width could be detected
automatically up to a depth of around 1.5 mm, based on the phase signal trends.
Sub-sampling of frame data showed that at least 10 frames were required per

shown that phase contrast was similar for shallower defects up to 1.5 mm deep,

reconnection rate. This can lead to an unstable feedback loop as reconnection
drives turbulence and turbulence drives reconnection. Stochastic reconnection
was proposed, and subsequently tested by numerical simulations, for high
$\beta$ plasmas with a magnetic Prandtl number of order unity, $Pr_m\sim 1$.
This model predicts reconnection speeds comparable to the large scale turbulent
eddy velocity. A recent study of stochastic reconnection for $Pr_m>1$ has shown
that the width of the outflow layer and the ejection velocity of matter from
the reconnection region seem to be unaffected by viscosity in typical
astrophysical systems. However if $Pr_m>1$ viscosity can suppress small scale
reconnection events near and below the Kolmogorov or viscous damping scale.
This will produce a threshold for the suppression of large scale reconnection
by viscosity when $Pr_m$ is larger than the root of the Reynolds number,
$Pr_m>\sqrt{Re}$. For $Pr_m>1$ this leads to the spectral index $\sim-4/3$ for
length scales between the viscous dissipation scale and eddies larger by
roughly $Pr_m^{3/2}$.

$R^N$, generated by second order differential operators of (possibly)
degenerate type. The operators that we consider {\em need not} satisfy the
H\""ormander condition. Instead, they satisfy the so-called UFG condition,
introduced by Herman, Lobry and Sussman in the context of geometric control
theory and later by Kusuoka and Stroock, this time with probabilistic
motivations. In this paper we study UFG diffusions and demonstrate the
importance of such a class of processes in several respects: roughly speaking
i) we show that UFG processes constitute a family of SDEs which exhibit
multiple invariant measures and for which one is able to describe a systematic
procedure to determine the basin of attraction of each invariant measure
(equilibrium state). ii) We use an explicit change of coordinates to prove that
every UFG diffusion can be, at least locally, represented as a system
consisting of an SDE coupled with an ODE, where the ODE evolves independently
of the SDE part of the dynamics. iii) As a result, UFG diffusions are
inherently ""less smooth"" than hypoelliptic SDEs; more precisely, we prove that
UFG processes do not admit a density with respect to Lebesgue measure on the
entire space, but only on suitable time-evolving submanifolds, which we
describe. iv) We show that our results and techniques, which we devised for UFG
processes, can be applied to the study of the long-time behaviour of
non-autonomous hypoelliptic SDEs and therefore produce several results on this
latter class of processes as well. v) Because processes that satisfy the
(uniform) parabolic H\""ormander condition are UFG processes, our paper contains
a wealth of results about the long time behaviour of (uniformly) hypoelliptic
processes which are non-ergodic, in the sense that they exhibit multiple
invariant measures.

Saturation is traced to be caused by the transfer of ions from the drop to the

common procedure in machine learning. This step is beneficial mainly for two
reasons: (1) it reduces the data dimensionality and (2) it provides a new data
representation possibly characterised by convenient geometric properties.
Euclidean spaces are by far the most widely used embedding spaces, thanks to
their well-understood structure and large availability of consolidated
inference methods. However, recent research demonstrated that many types of
complex data (e.g., those represented as graphs) are actually better described
by non-Euclidean geometries. Here, we investigate how embedding graphs on
constant-curvature manifolds (hyper-spherical and hyperbolic manifolds) impacts
on the ability to detect changes in sequences of attributed graphs. The
proposed methodology consists in embedding graphs into a geometric space and
perform change detection there by means of conventional methods for numerical
streams. The curvature of the space is a parameter that we learn to reproduce
the geometry of the original application-dependent graph space. Preliminary
experimental results show the potential capability of representing graphs by
means of curved manifold, in particular for change and anomaly detection

devices (BDs) to transmit information over ambient radio-frequency (RF)
carriers without using an RF transmitter, and thus has emerged as a promising
technology for green Internet-of-Things. This paper considers an AmBC network
in which a full-duplex access point (FAP) simultaneously transmits downlink
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals to its legacy user
(LU) and receives uplink signals backscattered from multiple BDs in a
time-division-multiple-access manner. To enhance the system performance from
multiple design dimensions and ensure fairness, we maximize the minimum
throughput among all BDs by jointly optimizing the BDs' backscatter time
portions, the BDs' power reflection coefficients, and the FAP's subcarrier
power allocation, subject to the LU's throughput constraint, the BDs'
harvested-energy constraints, and other practical constraints. As such, we
propose an efficient iterative algorithm for solving the formulated non-convex
problem by leveraging the block coordinated decent and successive convex
optimization techniques. We further show the convergence of the proposed
algorithm, and analyze its complexity. Finally, extensive simulation results
show that the proposed joint design achieves significant throughput gains as

Authentication (OAuth 2.0) protocols that are vulnerable to cross-site-recovery
forgery (CSRF), which shows that these techniques may not prevent an adversary
from copying or modeling the secret IDs or encryption keys using invasive, side
channel, learning or software attacks. Physical unclonable functions (PUF), on
the other hand, can exploit manufacturing process variations to uniquely
identify silicon chips which makes a PUF-based system extremely robust and
secure at low cost, as it is practically impossible to replicate the same
silicon characteristics across dies. Taking inspiration from human
communication, which utilizes inherent variations in the voice signatures to
identify a certain speaker, we present RF- PUF: a deep neural network-based

'hatching' is applied to the line patterns naturally occuring in FDM prints,
which are built up in a layer-by-layer fashion. The proposed halftoning
technique isn't limited by the challenges existing techniques face; existing
FDM coloring techniques greatly influence the surface geometry and deteriorate
with surface slopes deviating from vertical or greatly influence the basic

  technique for advection dominated advection-diffusion-reaction problems",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a filter stabilization technique with a deconvolution-based
indicator function for the simulation of advection dominated
advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) problems with under-refined meshes. The
proposed technique has been previously applied to the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations and has been successfully validated against
experimental data. However, it was found that some key parameters in this
approach have a strong impact on the solution. To better understand the role of
these parameters, we consider ADR problems, which are simpler than
incompressible flow problems. For the implementation of the filter
stabilization technique to ADR problems we adopt a three-step algorithm that
requires (i) the solution of the given problem on an under-refined mesh, (ii)
the application of a filter to the computed solution, and (iii) a relaxation
step. We compare our deconvolution-based approach to classical stabilization
methods and test its sensitivity to model parameters on a 2D benchmark problem.

transfer rate from the irradiating ion to the target material's electrons. Due
to the scarcity and significant uncertainties in experimental electronic
stopping power data for materials beyond simple solids, there has been growing
interest in the use of first-principles theory for calculating electronic
stopping power. In recent years, advances in high-performance computing have
opened the door to fully first-principles nonequilibrium simulations based on
real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT). While it has
been demonstrated that the RT-TDDFT approach is capable of predicting
electronic stopping power for a wide range of condensed matter systems, there
has yet to be an exhaustive examination of the physical and numerical
approximations involved and their effects on the calculated stopping power. We
discuss the results of such a study for crystalline silicon with protons as
irradiating ions. We examine the influences of key approximations in RT-TDDFT
nonequilibrium simulations on the calculated electronic stopping power,
including approximations related to basis sets, finite size effects,
exchange-correlation approximation, pseudopotentials, and more. Finally, we
propose a simple and efficient correction scheme to account for the
contribution from core-electron excitations to the stopping power, as it was
found to be significant for large proton velocities.

primary star of an unresolved binary system. We develop a joint analysis of
multi-colour photometry, centroids, radial velocity (RV) cross-correlation
function (CCF) profiles and their bisector inverse slopes (BIS) to disentangle
this three-body system. Data from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS),
SPECULOOS and HARPS are analysed and modelled with our new blendfitter
software. We find that the binary consists of NGTS-3A (G6V-dwarf) and NGTS-3B
(K1V-dwarf) at <1 arcsec separation. NGTS-3Ab orbits every P = 1.675 days. The
planet radius and mass are R_planet = 1.48+-0.37 R_J and M_planet = 2.38+-0.26
M_J, suggesting it is potentially inflated. We emphasise that only combining
all the information from multi-colour photometry, centroids and RV CCF profiles
can resolve systems like NGTS-3. Such systems cannot be disentangled from
single-colour photometry and RV measurements alone. Importantly, the presence
of a BIS correlation indicates a blend scenario, but is not sufficient to
determine which star is orbited by the third body. Moreover, even if no BIS
correlation is detected, a blend scenario cannot be ruled out without further
information. The choice of methodology for calculating the BIS can influence
the measured significance of its correlation. The presented findings are
crucial to consider for wide-field transit surveys, which require wide CCD
pixels (>5 arcsec) and are prone to contamination by blended objects. With TESS
on the horizon, it is pivotal for the candidate vetting to incorporate all
available follow-up information from multi-colour photometry and RV CCF
profiles.

Furthermore, the paramagnetic and magnetic phases coexisting with Kondo
couplings are systematically investigated through the slave-boson theory, for

macroscopic bodies have sharply peaked energy distributions, with their width
relative to the average scaling between $\sim N^{-1}$ and $\sim N^{-1/2}$, with
$N \gg 1$, the number of atoms conforming the body. Those states are dense
superpositions of energy eigenstates within arbitrary finite or infinite energy
intervals that decay sufficiently fast. The sharpness of the energy
distribution implies that closed systems in those states are {\it
microcanonical} in the sense that only energy eigenstates very near to the mean
energy contribute to their thermodynamic evolution. Since thermodynamics
accurately describes processes of macroscopic bodies and requires that closed
systems have constant energy, our claim is that these pure states are typical
of macroscopic systems. The main assumption beneath the energy sharpness is
that the isolated body can reach thermal equilibrium if left unaltered. We
argue that such a self-sharpness of the energy in macroscopic bodies indicates
that the First Law of Thermodynamics is statistical in character.

exploiting single-source DA methods for learning target classifiers may lead to

novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which (i) automatically
discovers latent domains in visual datasets and (ii) exploits this information

magnetopause of the Earth's magnetosphere during mainly northward
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) periods. Two-fluid simulations show that
the initial magnetic shear at the magnetopause and the field line bending
caused by the dynamics itself (in a configuration taken as representative of
the properties of the flank magnetopause) influence both the location where the
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability and the induced magnetic reconnection take
place and their nonlinear development. The KH vortices develop asymmetrically
with respect to the Earth's equatorial plane where the local KH linear growth
rate is maximal. Vortex driven reconnection processes take place at different
latitudes, ranging from the equatorial plane to mid-latitude regions, but only
in the hemisphere that turns out to be the less KH unstable. These results
suggest that KH-induced reconnection is not limited to specific regions around
the vortices (inside, below or above), but may be triggered over a broad and
continuous range of locations in the vicinity of the vortices.

injections to increase the liquidity of a firm for it to maximise profit from

incurs a fixed transaction cost. In addition to maximising their terminal
reward, the investor seeks to minimise the risk of loss of their investment
(from a possible firm ruin) by exiting the market at some point in time. We
show that the problem can be reformulated in terms of a new stochastic
differential game of control and stopping in which one of the players modifies
a (jump-)diffusion process using impulse controls and an adversary chooses a
stopping time to end the game. We show that the value of this game can be
computed by solving a double obstacle problem described by a quasi-variational

parameters such as the number of threads and the scratchpad memory usage per
thread block--forms a critical component of modern GPU programming models. This
specification determines the parallelism, and hence performance, of the
application during execution because the corresponding on-chip hardware
resources are allocated and managed based on this specification. This
tight-coupling between the software-provided resource specification and
resource management in hardware leads to significant challenges in programming
ease, portability, and performance. Zorua is a new resource virtualization
framework, that decouples the programmer-specified resource usage of a GPU
application from the actual allocation in the on-chip hardware resources. Zorua
enables this decoupling by virtualizing each resource transparently to the
programmer.
  We demonstrate that by providing the illusion of more resources than
physically available via controlled and coordinated virtualization, Zorua
offers several important benefits: (i) Programming Ease. Zorua eases the burden
on the programmer to provide code that is tuned to efficiently utilize the
physically available on-chip resources. (ii) Portability. Zorua alleviates the
necessity of re-tuning an application's resource usage when porting the
application across GPU generations. (iii) Performance. By dynamically
allocating resources and carefully oversubscribing them when necessary, Zorua
improves or retains the performance of applications that are already highly
tuned to best utilize the resources.

paper, we develop Dicke's formalism. The metric expansion in standard cosmology
(the time-dependent scale factor of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre curved spacetime
metric) is replaced by a flat and static Euclidean metric with a change with
time of the vacuum index. We show that a vacuum index increasing with time
produces both the cosmological redshift and time dilation, and that the
predicted evolution of the energy density of the cosmological microwave
background is consistent with the standard cosmology. We then show that the

well modeled by a vacuum index varying exponentially as n(t)=exp(t/tau0), where
tau0=8.0+0.2-0.8 Gyr. The main consequence of this formalism is that the
cosmological redshift should affect any atom, with a relative decrease of the
energy levels of about -2 10^{-18} per second. Possibilities for an

  Price Prediction",,,,,"cs.CY cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electricity is bought and sold in wholesale markets at prices that fluctuate
significantly. Short-term forecasting of electricity prices is an important
endeavor because it helps electric utilities control risk and because it
influences competitive strategy for generators. As the ""smart grid"" grows,
short-term price forecasts are becoming an important input to bidding and
control algorithms for battery operators and demand response aggregators. While
the statistics and machine learning literature offers many proposed methods for
electricity price prediction, there is no consensus supporting a single best
approach. We test two contrasting machine learning approaches for predicting
electricity prices, regression decision trees and recurrent neural networks
(RNNs), and compare them to a more traditional ARIMA implementation. We conduct
the analysis on a challenging dataset of electricity prices from ERCOT, in
Texas, where price fluctuation is especially high. We find that regression
decision trees in particular achieves high performance compared to the other
methods, suggesting that regression trees should be more carefully considered
for electricity price forecasting.

comparison of three classification models is conducted using features extracted
using local binary patterns, the histogram of gradients, and a pre-trained deep
network. Three common image classification methods, including support vector
machines, decision trees, and artificial neural networks are used to classify
feature vectors obtained by different feature extractors. We use KIMIA Path960,
a publicly available dataset of $960$ histopathology images extracted from $20$
different tissue scans to test the accuracy of classification and feature
extractions models used in the study, specifically for the histopathology
images. SVM achieves the highest accuracy of $90.52\%$ using local binary
patterns as features which surpasses the accuracy obtained by deep features,
namely $81.14\%$.

integrates water dynamics, hysteresis and the effect of bulk density on
conductivity to extract soil parameters required from most simulation models.
The method is applied to sub-sets of data collection, allowing to understand
that not every data-sets contains the information required for method
convergence. A comparison with experimental bulk-density values show that
inversion could give information even with a better adherence to model, as it
considers the effect of roots and skeleton. The method may be applied to any
type of multi-layer water content probes giving the opportunity to enrich soil
parameter availability and reliability.

currents, a phenomena called the gating of a single channel. Channels switch
between an 'open' state with a well defined single amplitude of current and
'closed' states with nearly zero current. The existing mean-field theory of ion
channels focuses almost solely on the open state. The physical modeling of the
dynamical features of ion channels is still in its infancy, and does not
describe the transitions between open and closed states, nor the distribution
of the duration times of open states. One hypothesis is that gating corresponds
to noise-induced fast transitions between multiple steady (equilibrium) states
of the underlying system. In this work, we aim to test this hypothesis.
Particularly, our study focuses on the (high order) steric
Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Cahn-Hilliard model since it has been successful in
predicting permeability and selectivity of ionic channels in their open state,
and since it gives rise to multiple steady states. We show that this system
gives rise to a gating-like behavior, but that important features of this
switching behavior are different from the defining features of gating in
biological systems. Furthermore, we show that noise prohibits switching in the
system of study. The above phenomena are expected to occur in other PNP-type
models, strongly suggesting that one has to go beyond over-damped (gradient
flow) Nernst-Planck type dynamics to explain the spontaneous gating of single
channels.
