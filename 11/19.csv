weights are used for image-based gender recognition and age estimation.
Transfer learning is explored using both VGG19 and VGGFace pretrained models by
testing the effects of changes in various design schemes and training
parameters in order to improve prediction accuracy. Training techniques such as
input standardization, data augmentation, and label distribution age encoding
are compared. Finally, a hierarchy of deep CNNs is tested that first classifies
subjects by gender, and then uses separate male and female age models to
predict age. A gender recognition accuracy of 98.7% and an MAE of 4.1 years is
achieved. This paper shows that, with proper training techniques, good results
can be obtained by retasking existing convolutional filters towards a new
purpose.

during northeast monsoon season are presented. It was observed that the
propagation of vortices over the peninsular orography was controlled by the
vortex Froude number, Frv = Vmax/(NH), where, Vmax is the maximum tangential
velocity of winds in the vortex, H is the height of the orography, and N is the
Brunt-Vaisala frequency of atmosphere along the orography. Strong vortices with
Frv > 1 overcame the orographic barrier and crossed the peninsula. While, those
with Frv < 1 were blocked by the orography. The blocked vortices remained
stationary along the east coast for two to three days. In these cases, clouds
formed continuously along the coast for three consecutive days. Therefore,
there was intense rainfall over the coast and little rainfall over orography
during this time. In unblocked vortices, the rainfall intensity showed a
systematic shift from coastal to the higher orographic region within a day or
two. However, significant weakening of the vortices, as well as convection, was
seen as the vortex arrived over the higher plateau. These case studies will be
helpful for forecasting heavy rainfall events over the Indian peninsula during
northeast monsoon season.

Optimization algorithm (PPO) have successfully applied in complex

from high variances and high sample complexity. On the other hand, model-based
reinforcement learning methods that learn the transition dynamics are more
sample efficient, but they often suffer from the bias of the transition
estimation. How to make use of both model-based and model-free learning is a
central problem in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we present a new
technique to address the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, which
regards the difference between model-free and model-based estimations as a
measure of exploration value. We apply this new technique to the PPO algorithm
and arrive at a new policy optimization method, named Policy Optimization with
Model-based Explorations (POME). POME uses two components to predict the
actions' target values: a model-free one estimated by Monte-Carlo sampling and
a model-based one which learns a transition model and predicts the value of the
next state. POME adds the error of these two target estimations as the
additional exploration value for each state-action pair, i.e, encourages the
algorithm to explore the states with larger target errors which are hard to
estimate. We compare POME with PPO on Atari 2600 games, and it shows that POME
outperforms PPO on 33 games out of 49 games.

complication in estimating the temperature of the atomic gas is that the line
width may have significant contribution from non-thermal broadening. We propose
a formalism here to separate the thermal and non-thermal broadening using a
self-consistent model of turbulence broadening of the HI 21 cm absorption
components. Applying this novel method, we have estimated the spin and the
kinetic temperature of diffuse Galactic neutral hydrogen, and found that a
large fraction of gas has temperature in the unstable range. The turbulence is
found to be subsonic or transonic in nature, and the clouds seem to have a
bimodal size distribution. Assuming that the turbulence is magnetohydrodynamic
in nature, the estimated magnetic field strength is of {\mu}G order, and is
found to be uncorrelated with the HI number density.

brain imaging have led to an abundance of high-dimensional and correlated data
being routinely collected. Classical multivariate approaches like Multivariate
Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) can be
used to study relationships between such multivariate datasets. Yet, special
care is required with high-dimensional data, as the test statistics may be
ill-defined and classical inference procedures break down.
  In this work, we explain how valid p-values can be derived for these
multivariate methods even in high dimensional datasets. Our main contribution
is an empirical estimator for the largest root distribution of a singular
double Wishart problem; this general framework underlies many common
multivariate analysis approaches. From a small number of permutations of the
data, we estimate the location and scale parameters of a parametric Tracy-Widom
family that provides a good approximation of this distribution. Through
simulations, we show that this estimated distribution also leads to valid
p-values that can be used for high-dimensional inference. We then apply our
approach to a pathway-based analysis of the association between DNA methylation
and disease type in patients with systemic auto-immune rheumatic diseases.

is controlled by an adversarial jammer by viewing it as a zero-sum game between
a finite blocklength encoder-decoder team, and the jammer. The encoder-decoder
team choose stochastic encoding and decoding strategies to minimize the average
probability of error in transmission, while the jammer chooses a distribution
on the state-space to maximize this probability. The min-max value of this game
is equivalent to channel coding for a compound channel -- we call this the
Shannon solution of the problem. The max-min value corresponds to finding a
mixed channel with the largest value of the minimum achievable probability of
error. When the min-max and max-min values are equal, the problem is said to
admit a saddle-point or von Neumann solution. While a Shannon solution always
exists, a von Neumann solution need not, owing to inherent nonconvexity in the
communicating team's problem. Despite this, we show that the min-max and
max-min values become equal asymptotically in the large blocklength limit, for
all but finitely many rates. We explicitly characterize this limiting value as
a function of the rate and obtain tight finite blocklength bounds on the
min-max and max-min value. As a corollary we get an explicit expression for the
$\epsilon$-capacity of a compound channel under stochastic codes -- the first
such result, to the best of our knowledge. Our results demonstrate a deeper
relation between the compound channel and mixed channel than was previously
known. They also show that the conventional information-theoretic viewpoint,
articulated via the Shannon solution, coincides asymptotically with the
game-theoretic one articulated via the von Neumann solution.

quasi-particles, their zero point energies contain the quadratic and
logarithmic UV divergences even after the vacuum subtraction. The coefficients
of these divergences come from the difference between the vacuum and in-medium

by consistently using fermion propagators to compute the quasi-particle
contributions as well as their interplay, provided that the self-energies of
the constituents at large momenta approach to the vacuum ones sufficiently
fast. In the case of quantum chromodynamics, mesons and baryons, which may be
induced or destroyed by medium effects, yield the in-medium divergences in the
zero point energies, but the divergences are assembled to cancel with those
from the quark zero-point energy. This is particularly important for unified
descriptions of hadronic and quark matter which may be smoothly connected by
the quark-hadron continuity.

surface by connecting more and more attractive attack targets, i.e. embedded
devices, to the Internet. One key component in securing these devices is
software integrity checking, which typically attained with Remote Attestation
(RA). RA is realized as an interactive protocol, whereby a trusted party,
verifier, verifies the software integrity of a potentially compromised remote
device, prover. In the vast majority of IoT applications, smart devices operate
in swarms, thus triggering the need for efficient swarm attestation schemes. In
this paper, we present WISE, the first intelligent swarm attestation protocol
that aims to minimize the communication overhead while preserving an adequate
level of security. WISE depends on a resource-efficient smart broadcast
authentication scheme where devices are organized in fine-grained
multi-clusters, and whenever needed, the most likely compromised devices are
attested. The candidate devices are selected intelligently taking into account
the attestation history and the diverse characteristics (and constraints) of
each device in the swarm. We show that WISE is very suitable for
resource-constrained embedded devices, highly efficient and scalable in
heterogenous IoT networks, and offers an adjustable level of security.

attestation has received little attention although current single-device
approaches show limited scalability in IoT applications. Though recent work has
yielded some proposals for scalable attestation, several aspects remain
unexplored, and thus more research is required. This paper presents slimIoT, a
scalable lightweight attestation protocol that is suitable for all IoT devices.
slimIoT depends on an efficient broadcast authentication scheme along with
symmetric key cryptography. It is resilient against a strong adversary with
physical access to the IoT device. Our protocol is informative in the sense
that it identifies the precise status of every device in the network. We
implement and evaluate slimIoT considering many factors. On the one hand, our
evaluation results show a low overhead in terms of memory footprint and
runtime. On the other hand, simulations demonstrate that slimIoT is scalable,
robust and highly efficient to be used in static and dynamic networks
consisting of thousands of heterogenous IoT devices.

which the pairing responsible for superconductivity still exists, but
superconductivity itself does not. An analogy, drawn from particle physics, may
be the Higgs to confinement phase transition in an SU(N) gauge theory, where
the confined phase is a vortex liquid, and the Higgs phase is a phase of a
broken global $Z_N$ symmetry. We illustrate this idea with numerical
simulations of a spatially asymmetric U(1) gauge-Higgs model, with lattice
artifact monopoles suppressed. We show the existence of a Higgs
(superconductor) to confinement (vortex liquid) phase, explicitly identifying
vortices in lattice configurations generated in the confined phase, and showing
that they produce an area-law falloff in planar Wilson loops, which may be
measurable experimentally. The superconducting phase is a phase of broken

information during training significantly improves performance of pose
estimation from RGB images during testing. We explore different ways of using
this privileged information: (1) using depth data to initially train a
depth-based network, (2) using the features from the depth-based network of the
paired depth images to constrain mid-level RGB network weights, and (3) using
the foreground mask, obtained from the depth data, to suppress the responses
from the background area. By using paired RGB and depth images, we are able to
supervise the RGB-based network to learn middle layer features that mimic that
of the corresponding depth-based network, which is trained on large-scale,
accurately annotated depth data. During testing, when only an RGB image is
available, our method produces accurate 3D hand pose predictions. Our method is

of including this runaway direction as a model of quintessence that satisfies

maximum provides a runaway direction that is unstable in the axion directions,
sensitive to initial conditions and too steep to allow for a Hubble time of
expansion without violating the field excursion criterion. Adding a second
non-perturbative effect generates a saddle point in the potential, which solves
the steepness problem and improves the initial conditions problem although some
fine-tuning remains required.

modeled as perfectly periodic, and therefore infinite. Here, we investigate the
legitimacy of this approximation by studying the evolution of the optical
response of finite arrays of nanostructures as their number of elements is
increased. We find that the number of elements necessary to reach the infinite
array limit is determined by the strength of the coupling between them, and
that, even when that limit is reached, the individual responses of the elements
may still display significant variations. In addition, we show that, when
retardation is negligible, the resonance frequency for the infinite array is
always redshifted compared to the single particle. However, in the opposite
situation, there could be either a blue- or a redshift. We also study the
effects of inhomogeneity in size and position of the elements on the optical
response of the array. This work advances the understanding of the behavior of
finite and infinite arrays of nanostructures, and therefore provides guidance
to design applications that utilize these systems.

super-dipolar glass state in Gd3+-ion substituted PMN, when the charge
imbalance is compensated by creating B-site vacancy or changing B-site cations

substituted PMN when the charge imbalance is compensated by creating A-site
vacancies, which causes reduction in interaction among the PNRs and
circumventing the super-dipolar glass state.

The simulation of quantum transport in realistic materials calls for the

become enabling tools for guiding experimental research and for supporting the
interpretation of measurements. In this review, we describe and compare
different order-$N$ computational methods that have been developed during the
past twenty years, and which have been used extensively to explore quantum

zero-frequency electrical conductivities derived within the Kubo-Greenwood and
Kubo-Streda formalisms, and illustrate the capabilities of these methods to
tackle the quasi-ballistic, diffusive, and localization regimes of quantum
transport in the noninteracting limit. The fundamental issue of computational
cost versus accuracy of various proposed numerical schemes is addressed in
depth. We then illustrate the usefulness of these methods with various examples
of transport in disordered materials, such as polycrystalline and defected
graphene models, 3D metals and Dirac semimetals, carbon nanotubes, and organic
semiconductors. Finally, we extend the review to the study of spin dynamics and
topological transport, for which efficient approaches for calculating charge,

low-latency for smooth operation. Hence in this paper, aiming to improve VR
experience in multi-user VR wireless video streaming, a deep-learning aided
scheme for maximizing the quality of the delivered video chunks with
low-latency is proposed. Therein the correlations in the predicted field of
view (FoV) and locations of viewers watching 360$^\circ$ HD VR videos are
capitalized on to realize a proactive FoV-centric millimeter wave (mmWave)
physical-layer multicast transmission. The problem is cast as a frame quality
maximization problem subject to tight latency constraints and network
stability. The problem is then decoupled into an HD frame request admission and
scheduling subproblems and a matching theory game is formulated to solve the
scheduling subproblem by associating requests from clusters of users to mmWave
small cell base stations (SBSs) for their unicast/multicast transmission.
Furthermore, for realistic modeling and simulation purposes, a real VR
head-tracking dataset and a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) based on gated
recurrent units (GRUs) are leveraged. Extensive simulation results show how the
content-reuse for clusters of users with highly overlapping FoVs brought in by
multicasting reduces the VR frame delay in 12\%. This reduction is further
boosted by proactiveness that cuts by half the average delays of both reactive
unicast and multicast baselines while preserving HD delivery rates above 98\%.
Finally, enforcing tight latency bounds shortens the delay-tail as evinced by
13\% lower delays in the 99th percentile.

capacity constrained vehicles. The aim is to plan tours for vehicles to supply
a given number of customers as efficiently as possible. The problem is the
combinatorial explosion of possible solutions, which increases
superexponentially with the number of customers. Classical solutions provide
good approximations to the globally optimal solution. D-Wave's quantum annealer
is a machine designed to solve optimization problems. This machine uses quantum
effects to speed up computation time compared to classic computers. The problem
on solving the CVRP on the quantum annealer is the particular formulation of
the optimization problem. For this, it has to be mapped onto a quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. Complex optimization problems
such as the CVRP can be translated to smaller subproblems and thus enable a
sequential solution of the partitioned problem. This work presents a

$\mathscr{S}(\mathcal{H})$ of a finite-level quantum system with Hilbert space
$\mathcal{H}$ from a group-theoretical point of view. This space carries two
stratifications generated by the action of two different Lie groups: the
special unitary group $\mathcal{SU}(\mathcal{H})$ and its complexification
$\mathcal{SL}(\mathcal{H})$, the complex special linear group. A stratum of the
stratification generated by $\mathcal{SU}(\mathcal{H})$ is composed of
isospectral states, that is, density operators with the same spectrum, A
stratum of the stratification generated by $\mathcal{SL}(\mathcal{H})$ is
composed of quantum states with the same rank.
  We prove that on every submanifold of isospectral quantum states there is
also a canonical left action of $\mathcal{SL}(\mathcal{H})$ which is related
with the canonical K\""{a}hler structure on isospectral quantum states. The
fundamental vector fields of this $\mathcal{SL}(\mathcal{H})$-action are
divided into Hamiltonian and gradient vector fields. The former give rise to
invertible maps on $\mathscr{S}(\mathcal{H})$ that preserve the von Neumann
entropy and the convex structure of $\mathscr{S}(\mathcal{H})$, while the
latter give rise to invertible maps on $\mathscr{S}(\mathcal{H})$ that preserve
the von Neumann entropy but not the convex structure of
$\mathscr{S}(\mathcal{H})$.
  A similar decomposition is given for the $\mathcal{SL}(\mathcal{H})$-action
generating the stratification of $\mathscr{S}(\mathcal{H})$ into manifolds of
quantum states with the same rank, where gradient vector fields preserve the
rank but do not preserve entropy.
  Some comments on multipartite quantum systems are made. It is proved that the
sets of product states of a multipartite quantum system are homogeneous
manifolds for the action of the complex special linear group associated with
the partition.

methods to fuse information from multiple medical imaging modalities are

challenges, as current deep learning architectures lack the ability to extract
useful representations from multimodal information, and often simple
concatenation is used to fuse such information. In this work, we propose
Multimodal DenseNet, a novel architecture for fusing multimodal data. Instead
of focusing on concatenation or early and late fusion, our proposed
architectures fuses information over several layers and gives the model
flexibility in how it combines information from multiple sources. We apply this
architecture to the challenge of polyp characterization and landmark
identification in endoscopy. Features from white light images are fused with
features from narrow band imaging or depth maps. This study demonstrates that
Multimodal DenseNet outperforms monomodal classification as well as other
multimodal fusion techniques by a significant margin on two different datasets.

global melting events due to accretionary collisions with other protoplanets.
The detection and characterization of their post-collision afterglows (magma

observational prospects to detect the radiative signature of forming planets
covered by such collision-induced magma oceans in nearby young stellar
associations with future direct imaging facilities. We have compared
performance estimates for near- and mid-infrared instruments to be installed at
ESO's Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), and a potential space-based mission
called Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE). We modelled the frequency
and timing of energetic collisions using \textit{N}-body models of planet
formation for different stellar types, and determine the cooling of the
resulting magma oceans with an insulating atmosphere. We find that the
probability of detecting at least one magma ocean planet depends on the
observing duration and the distribution of atmospheric properties among rocky
protoplanets. However, the prospects for detection significantly increase for
young and close stellar targets, which show the highest frequencies of giant
impacts. For intensive reconnaissance with a K band (2.2 $\mu m$) ELT filter or

center networks and cloud services. Addressing some key challenges in the
allocation of shared resources to user requests (jobs) in such settings, we
consider the following variants of the classic {\em resource allocation
problem} (\textsf{RAP}). The input to our problems is a set $J$ of jobs and a
set $M$ of homogeneous hosts, each has an available amount of some resource. A
job is associated with a release time, a due date, a weight, and a given
length, as well as its resource requirement. A \emph{feasible} schedule is an
allocation of the resource to a subset of the jobs, satisfying the job release
times/due dates as well as the resource constraints. A crucial distinction
between classic {\textsf{RAP}} and our problems is that we allow preemption and
migration of jobs, motivated by virtualization techniques.
  We consider two natural objectives: {\em throughput maximization}
(\textsf{MaxT}), which seeks a maximum weight subset of the jobs that can be
feasibly scheduled on the hosts in $M$, and {\em resource minimization}
(\textsf{MinR}), that is finding the minimum number of (homogeneous) hosts
needed to feasibly schedule all jobs. Both problems are known to be NP-hard.
  We first present a $\Omega(1)$-approximation algorithm for \textsf{MaxT}
instances where time-windows form a laminar family of intervals. We then extend
the algorithm to handle instances with arbitrary time-windows, assuming there
is sufficient slack for each job to be completed.
  For \textsf{MinR} we study a more general setting with $d$ resources and
derive an $O(\log d)$-approximation for any fixed $d \geq 1$, under the
assumption that time-windows are not too small. This assumption can be removed
leading to a slightly worse ratio of $O(\log d\log^* T)$, where $T$ is the
maximum due date of any job.

it happens very rarely that scientists examine numerous large graphs on the

method for detecting unknown systematic effects, we find that the ""Pantheon""
sample has been well calibrated and the bias caused by unknown systematic
errors has been minimized. We present the estimate of distances measured from
SNe Ia and reconstruct the expansion history of the Universe. The results are
in agreement with a simple cosmological constant model and reveals the possible
improvements that future SN Ia observations from WFIRST and LSST can target. We
have derived distance priors using the CMB data from the Planck 2018 final data
release, and combine them with SNe Ia and BAO data, to explore the impact from
the systematic errors of SNe Ia on the combined cosmological parameter
constraints. Using the combined data set of SNe Ia, BAO, and CMB distance
priors, we measure the dark energy density function $X(z)=\rho_X(z)/\rho_X(0)$
as a free function (defined as a cubic spline of its values at $z=0.33, 0.67,
1.0$), along with the cosmological parameters ($\Omega_k$, $\Omega_m$,
$\Omega_b$, $H_0$). We find no deviation from a flat Universe dominated by a
cosmological constant ($X(z)=1$), and $H_0=68.4\pm 0.9\text{km
s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, straddling the Planck team's measurement of
$H_0=67.4\pm 0.5\text{km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, and Riess et al. (2018)
measurement of $H_0=73.52\pm 1.62\text{km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. Adding
$H_0=73.52\pm 1.62\text{km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ as a prior to the combined
data set leads to the time dependence of the dark energy density at $z\sim
0.33$ at 68\% confidence level. Not including the systematic errors on SNe Ia
has a similar but larger effect on the dark energy density measurement.

underlying causes and correlates of chronic physical illnesses and mental
health conditions. In this paper, we explore the language of psychological
stress with a dataset of 601 social media users, who answered the Perceived
Stress Scale questionnaire and also consented to share their Facebook and
Twitter data. Firstly, we find that stressed users post about exhaustion,
losing control, increased self-focus and physical pain as compared to posts
about breakfast, family-time, and travel by users who are not stressed.
Secondly, we find that Facebook language is more predictive of stress than
Twitter language. Thirdly, we demonstrate how the language based models thus
developed can be adapted and be scaled to measure county-level trends. Since
county-level language is easily available on Twitter using the Streaming API,
we explore multiple domain adaptation algorithms to adapt user-level Facebook

macrostructures has remained the main obstacle. A promising approach to tackle
this issue is employing CNTs as nanofillers in copper matrixes. Subramaniam et

vol%)-Cu composite films with specific conductivity 26% greater than copper.
These results show that by improving the interfacial interactions between the
CNTs and the copper matrix strong and highly conductive nanocomposites can be
made. In this research continuous CNT-Cu nanocomposite is produced using

over $10^{4}$ years. The VLA 5 GHz, 8 GHz, and the ALMA 133 GHz images reveal
bimodal jet lobes with $\sim$5 kpc size and the absence of the central

region with the estimated size of $\sim$1 kpc, and the line strengths give the
AGN luminosity of $L_{\rm bol}=1.5 \times 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. On the other
hand, the current AGN activity estimated from the AGN torus emission gives the
upper bound of $L_{\rm bol} < 2.2 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The absence of
the radio-core gives the more strict upper bound of the current AGN luminosity
of $L_{\rm bol} < 8.0 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, suggesting that the central
engine is already quenched. These multi-wavelength signatures indicate that Arp
187 hosts a ""dying"" AGN: the central engine is already dead, but the large
scale AGN indicators are still observable as the remnant of the past AGN
activity. The central engine has experienced the drastic luminosity decline by
a factor of $\sim10^{3-5}$ fainter within $\sim10^{4}$ years, which is roughly
consistent with the viscous timescale of the inner part of the accretion disk

For example, monotonicity, Lipschitz continuity and submodularity are
$2$-local; convexity is (usually) $3$-local; and many typical problems in
computational biology and computer vision involve $o(n)$-local properties.
  In this work, we present a generic approach to test all local properties of
arrays over any finite (and not necessarily bounded size) alphabet. We show
that any $k$-local property of $d$-dimensional arrays is testable by a simple
canonical one-sided error non-adaptive $\varepsilon$-test, whose query
complexity is $O(\epsilon^{-1}k \log{\frac{\epsilon n}{k}})$ for $d = 1$ and
$O(c_d \epsilon^{-1/d} k \cdot n^{d-1})$ for $d > 1$. The queries made by the
canonical test constitute sphere-like structures of varying sizes, and are
completely independent of the property and the alphabet $\Sigma$. The query
complexity is optimal for a wide range of parameters: For $d=1$, this matches
the query complexity of many previously investigated local properties, while
for $d > 1$ we design and analyze new constructions of $k$-local properties

geometric patterns. Previously, a great amount of research focus on the
alignment of 2D or 3D patterns, especially in the field of computer vision.
Recently, the alignment of geometric patterns in high dimension finds several
novel applications, and has attracted more and more attentions. However, the
research is still rather limited in terms of algorithms. To the best of our
knowledge, most existing approaches for high dimensional alignment are just
simple extensions of their counterparts for 2D and 3D cases, and often suffer
from the issues such as high complexities. In this paper, we propose an
effective framework to compress the high dimensional geometric patterns and
approximately preserve the alignment quality. As a consequence, existing
alignment approach can be applied to the compressed geometric patterns and thus
the time complexity is significantly reduced. Our idea is inspired by the
observation that high dimensional data often has a low intrinsic dimension. We
adopt the widely used notion ""doubling dimension"" to measure the extents of our
compression and the resulting approximation. Finally, we test our method on
both random and real datasets, the experimental results reveal that running the
alignment algorithm on compressed patterns can achieve similar qualities,
comparing with the results on the original patterns, but the running times
(including the times cost for compression) are substantially lower.

its much smaller feature norms with respect to that of the source domain. To

demonstrate that progressively adapting the feature norms of the two domains to
a large range of values can result in significant transfer gains, implying that
those task-specific features with larger norms are more transferable. Our

adaptation with more robustness against the negative transfer issue. Without

  Marginalizing Latent Sampling","Accepted by IEEE TNNLS",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent techniques built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), such as
Cycle-Consistent GANs, are able to learn mappings among different domains built
from unpaired datasets, through min-max optimization games between generators
and discriminators. However, it remains challenging to stabilize the training
process and thus cyclic models fall into mode collapse accompanied by the
success of discriminator. To address this problem, we propose an novel Bayesian
cyclic model and an integrated cyclic framework for inter-domain mappings. The
proposed method motivated by Bayesian GAN explores the full posteriors of
cyclic model via sampling latent variables and optimizes the model with maximum
a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Hence, we name it Bayesian CycleGAN. In
addition, original CycleGAN cannot generate diversified results. But it is
feasible for Bayesian framework to diversify generated images by replacing
restricted latent variables in inference process. We evaluate the proposed
Bayesian CycleGAN on multiple benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes, Maps,
and Monet2photo. The proposed method improve the per-pixel accuracy by 15% for
the Cityscapes semantic segmentation task within origin framework and improve
20% within the proposed integrated framework, showing better resilience to
imbalance confrontation. The diversified results of Monet2Photo style transfer
also demonstrate its superiority over original cyclic model. We provide codes
for all of our experiments in https://github.com/ranery/Bayesian-CycleGAN.

spatial-temporal attention masks in a residual manner, RAL identifies the
discriminative spatial regions and temporal cues. The other stream in our

with an elite-clique at its center in which elites are also the centers of many
small groups. These leaders also act as bridges between different small groups.
Network dynamics are an important research topic due to their ability to
explain the evolution of network structures. In this paper, a Chinese Venture
Capital (VC) network was coded from joint investments between VC firms and then
analyzed to uncover its network properties and factors that influence its
evolution. We first built a random graph model to control for factors such as
network scale, network growth, investment frequency and syndication tendency.
Then we added a partner-selection mechanism and used two theories to analyze
the formation of network structure: relational embeddedness and structural
embeddedness. After that, we ran simulations and compared the three models with
the actual Chinese VC network. To do this we computed the elite-clique's EI
index, degree distribution, clustering coefficient distribution and motifs.
Results show that adding embeddedness theories significantly improved the
network dynamic model's predictive power, and help us uncover the mechanisms
that affect the formation of a small-world industrial network with an

emotional status of viewers from the multimedia content embedded in the online
video stream. Existing works fall in two categories: 1) visual-based methods,
which focus on visual content and extract a specific set of features of videos.
However, it is generally hard to learn a mapping function from low-level video
pixels to high-level emotion space due to great intra-class variance. 2)
textual-based methods, which focus on the investigation of user-generated
comments associated with videos. The learned word representations by
traditional linguistic approaches typically lack emotion information and the
global comments usually reflect viewers' high-level understandings rather than
instantaneous emotions. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose
to jointly utilize video content and user-generated texts simultaneously for
emotion analysis. In particular, we introduce exploiting a new type of
user-generated texts, i.e., ""danmu"", which are real-time comments floating on
the video and contain rich information to convey viewers' emotional opinions.
To enhance the emotion discriminativeness of words in textual feature
extraction, we propose Emotional Word Embedding (EWE) to learn text
representations by jointly considering their semantics and emotions.
Afterwards, we propose a novel visual-textual emotion analysis model with Deep
Coupled Video and Danmu Neural networks (DCVDN), in which visual and textual
features are synchronously extracted and fused to form a comprehensive
representation by deep-canonically-correlated-autoencoder-based multi-view
learning. Through extensive experiments on a self-crawled real-world

an expert neuropsychologist observes a person's accuracy and completion time as

machine learning can produce a frame-level description of the state of the
block task and the person's actions over the course of each test problem. We

e.g. the low-level non-stationarity such as spatial correlations or temporal

accumulation, deformation or dissipation of radar echoes in precipitation
forecasting. From Cramer's Decomposition, any non-stationary process can be
decomposed into deterministic, time-variant polynomials, plus a zero-mean
stochastic term. By applying differencing operations appropriately, we may turn
time-variant polynomials into a constant, making the deterministic component
predictable. However, most previous recurrent neural networks for
spatiotemporal prediction do not use the differential signals effectively, and
their relatively simple state transition functions prevent them from learning
too complicated variations in spacetime. We propose the Memory In Memory (MIM)
networks and corresponding recurrent blocks for this purpose. The MIM blocks
exploit the differential signals between adjacent recurrent states to model the
non-stationary and approximately stationary properties in spatiotemporal
dynamics with two cascaded, self-renewed memory modules. By stacking multiple
MIM blocks, we could potentially handle higher-order non-stationarity. The MIM
networks achieve the state-of-the-art results on four spatiotemporal prediction
tasks across both synthetic and real-world datasets. We believe that the
general idea of this work can be potentially applied to other time-series

when imaging protocols are different in deployment. In this paper, we propose a
DNN-based MS lesion segmentation framework with a novel technique called
sequence dropout which can adapt to various combinations of input MRI sequences
during deployment and achieve the maximal possible performance from the given

each MRI sequence on the MS lesion segmentation task without training separate

the maximal possible performance when one sequence is unavailable during

0-5) using bilateral CFP. DeepSeeNet was trained on 58,402 and tested on 900
images from the longitudinal follow-up of 4549 participants from AREDS. Gold
standard labels were obtained using reading center grades. DeepSeeNet simulates
the human grading process by first detecting individual AMD risk factors
(drusen size, pigmentary abnormalities) for each eye and then calculating a
patient-based AMD severity score using the AREDS Simplified Severity Scale.
DeepSeeNet performed better on patient-based classification (accuracy = 0.671;

obtain a new second-order infill approximation of the optimal threshold in

the origin. Estimation methods for these quantities are then developed, where
the spot volatility is estimated by a kernel estimator with thresholding and
the value of the jump density at the origin is estimated by a density kernel
estimator applied to those increments deemed to contain jumps by the chosen
thresholding criterion. Due to the interdependency between the model parameters

studies for a prototypical stochastic volatility model show that it is not only

exhibit extremely complex and striking dynamics, and are more universal in the
far-from-equilibrium natural system. Taking advantage of dispersive Fourier
transform and time lens, the spatio-temporal transient dynamics of dissipative
solitons have been characterized with both amplitude and phase. Yet, a full
avenue of the buildup process of dissipative soliton is full of debris for the
lack of the polarization evolution information. Here, we characterize the
probabilistic polarization distributions in the buildup of dissipative soliton
in a net-normal dispersion fiber laser system mode-locked by single-wall carbon
nanotubes. The lasing system operates from random amplified spontaneous
emission to stable dissipative soliton when the cavity gain is increasing, and
state of polarization of each wavelength convergence exponentially towards a
fixed point. To reveal the invariant polarization relationship among various
wavelengths, the phase diagram of the ellipticity angle and spherical

wavelength in the central region of the dissipative soliton is linearly spaced,
while those in the two fronts are spatially varying. Increasing cavity gain
leads to spectrum broadening, meanwhile, the polarizations of the new generated

into dissipative soliton explosion, during which a kind of polarization optical
rogue waves is identified. Those experimental results provide more information

moving cases). The bound states can exist up to arbitrary order in the
stationary case, however, only two-soliton bound state exists in the moving
case. Besides, the oblique stationary bound state can be generated for all
possible combinations of nonlinearity coefficients consisted of positive,
negative and mixed cases. Nevertheless, the parallel stationary and the moving
bound states are only possible when nonlinearity coefficients take opposite
signs.

(SISO) detection algorithm in a large-scale distributed multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system. The uplink interference suppression matrix is
designed to decompose the received multi-user signal into independent
single-user receptions. An improved minimum-mean-square-error iterative soft
decision interference cancellation (MMSE-ISDIC) based on eigenvalue
decomposition (EVD-MMSE-ISDIC) is proposed to perform low-complexity detection
of the decomposed signals. Furthermore, two iteration schemes are given to
improve receiving performance, which are iterative detection and decoding (IDD)
scheme and iterative detection (ID) scheme. While IDD utilizes the external
information generated by the decoder for iterative detection, the output
information of the detector is directly exploited with ID. In particular, a
large-scale distributed MIMO prototyping system is introduced and a 32$ \times
$32 (4 user equipments (UEs) and 4 remote antenna units (RAUs), each equipped
with 8 antennas) experimental tests at 3.5 GHz was performed. The experimental
results show that the proposed iterative receiver greatly outperforms the
linear MMSE receiver, since it reduces the average number of error blocks of
the system significantly.

fundamental problems and obtains the state-of-the-art running times. As
observed in [Alman and Williams, STOC 2017], almost all applications of the
polynomial method in algorithm design ultimately rely on certain low-rank
decompositions of the computation matrices corresponding to key subroutines.
They suggest that making use of low-rank decompositions directly could lead to
more powerful algorithms, as the polynomial method is just one way to derive
such a decomposition. Inspired by their observation, in this paper, we study
another way of systematically constructing low-rank decompositions of matrices
which could be used by algorithms. It is known that various types of
communication protocols lead to certain low-rank decompositions (e.g.,
$\mathsf{P}$ protocols/rank, $\mathsf{BQP}$ protocols/approximate rank). These
are usually interpreted as approaches for proving communication lower bounds,
while in this work we explore the other direction.
  We have the two generic algorithmic applications of communication protocols.
The first connection is that a fast $\mathsf{BQP}$ communication protocol for a
function $f$ implies a fast deterministic additive approximate counting
algorithm for a related pair counting problem. The second connection is that a
fast $\mathsf{AM}^{\mathsf{cc}}$ protocol for a function $f$ implies a
faster-than-bruteforce algorithm for $f\textsf{-Satisfying-Pair}$.
  We also apply our second connection to shed some light on long-standing open
problems in communication complexity. We show that if the Longest Common

then polynomial-size Formula-$\textsf{SAT}$ admits a $2^{n - n^{1-\delta}}$

computational capabilities of mobile devices and reducing their energy
consumption via offloading complex computation tasks to the nearby servers.
Multiuser MEC at servers is widely realized via parallel computing based on
virtualization. Due to finite shared I/O resources, interference between
virtual machines (VMs), called I/O interference, degrades the computation
performance. In this paper, we study the problem of joint radio-and-computation
resource allocation (RCRA) in multiuser MEC systems in the presence of I/O
interference. Specifically, offloading scheduling algorithms are designed
targeting two system performance metrics: sum offloading throughput
maximization and sum mobile energy consumption minimization. Their designs are
formulated as non-convex mixed-integer programming problems, which account for
latency due to offloading, result downloading and parallel computing. A set of
low-complexity algorithms are designed based on a decomposition approach and
leveraging classic techniques from combinatorial optimization. The resultant
algorithms jointly schedule offloading users, control their offloading sizes,
and divide time for communication (offloading and downloading) and computation.
They are either optimal or can achieve close-to-optimality as shown by
simulation. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate considering of I/O
interference can endow on an offloading controller robustness against the

in the location of individuals within such environments arises as a combination
of the mechanisms governing individual behavior and the heterogeneous structure

successfully implemented to elucidate the roles of the mechanisms underpinning
the behavior of individuals. In particular, the pair correlation function has
been used across biology, ecology and physics to obtain quantitative insight
into a variety of processes. However, naively applying standard pair
correlation functions in the presence of obstacles may fail to detect
correlation, or suggest false correlations, due to a reliance on a distance
metric that does not account for obstacles. To overcome this problem, here we
present an analytic expression for calculating a corrected pair correlation
function for lattice-based domains containing obstacles. We demonstrate that
this corrected pair correlation function is necessary for isolating the
correlation associated with the behavior of individuals, rather than the
structure of the environment. Using simulations that mimic cell migration and
proliferation we demonstrate that the corrected pair correlation function
recovers the short-range correlation known to be present in this process,
independent of the heterogeneous structure of the environment. Further, we show
that the analytic calculation of the corrected pair correlation derived here is
significantly faster to implement than the corresponding numerical approach.

an oscillating in time electric field are calculated in the framework of
quantum field theory. A pronounced enhancement of those distributions is
observed as the frequency of the electric field passes across the one-photon
threshold. Below that threshold the pairs preferentially carry a longitudinal
momentum, while above the threshold they tend to carry a transverse momentum.
Such momentum sharing has an impact on the number of produced pairs: It grows
fast with increasing the field frequency below the threshold but it saturates
at a roughly constant value above it. On the other hand, at the fixed frequency
above the one-photon threshold, the number of pairs scales quadratically with
the field strength. This typically perturbative scaling holds even for large
electric fields. Thus, the validity of the perturbation theory is extended here
to processes which result in creation of particles with substantial transverse
momenta.

at inferring the posterior of network weights based on a log-uniform prior on
them to learn these weights as well as dropout rate simultaneously. The
log-uniform prior not only interprets the regularization capacity of Gaussian
dropout in network training, but also underpins the inference of such
posterior. However, the log-uniform prior is an improper prior (i.e., its
integral is infinite) which causes the inference of posterior to be ill-posed,
thus restricting the regularization performance of VD. To address this problem,
we present a new generalization of Gaussian dropout, termed variational
Bayesian dropout (VBD), which turns to exploit a hierarchical prior on the
network weights and infer a new joint posterior. Specifically, we implement the
hierarchical prior as a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with variance sampled
from a uniform hyper-prior. Then, we incorporate such a prior into inferring
the joint posterior over network weights and the variance in the hierarchical
prior, with which both the network training and the dropout rate estimation can
be cast into a joint optimization problem. More importantly, the hierarchical
prior is a proper prior which enables the inference of posterior to be
well-posed. In addition, we further show that the proposed VBD can be
seamlessly applied to network compression. Experiments on both classification
and network compression tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed VBD in terms of regularizing network training.

  via higher-order asymptotic homogenisation",,,,,"physics.class-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Asymptotic multiple scale homogenisation allows to determine the effective
behaviour of a porous medium by starting from the pore-scale description, when
there is a large separation between the pore-scale and the macroscopic scale.
When the scale ratio is ""small but not too small,"" the standard approach based
on first-order homogenisation may break down since additional terms need to be
taken into account in order to obtain an accurate picture of the overall
response of the medium. The effect of low scale separation can be obtained by
exploiting higher order equations in the asymptotic homogenisation procedure.
The aim of the present study is to investigate higher-order terms up to the
third order of the advective-diffusive model to describe advection-diffusion in
a macroscopically homogeneous porous medium at low scale separation. The main
result of the study is that the low separation of scales induces dispersion
effects. In particular, the second-order model is similar to the most currently
used phenomenological model of dispersion: it is characacterized by a
dispersion tensor which can be decomposed into a purely diffusive component and
a mechanical dispersion part, whilst this property is not verifed in the
homogenised dispersion model (obtained at higher P\'eclet number). The
third-order description contains second and third concentration gradient terms,
with a fourth order tensor of diffusion and with a third-order and an
additional second-order tensors of dispersion. The analysis of the macroscopic
fluxes shows that the second and the third order macroscopic fluxes are
distinct from the volume means of the corresponding local fluxes and allows to
determine expressions of the non-local effects.

linear, are rare. Usually, structures are made of components assembled together
by means of joints whose behavior maybe highly nonlinear. Depending on the
amount of excitation, joints can dramatically change the dynamic behavior of
the whole system, and the modelling of this type of constraint is therefore
crucial for a correct prediction of the amount of vibration.
  The solution of the nonlinear equilibrium equations by means of the Harmonic
Balance Method (HBM) is widely accepted as an effective approach to calculate
the steady state forced response in the frequency domain, in spite of Direct
Time Integration (DTI). The state of the art contact element used to model the
friction forces at the joint interfaces is a nodal contact element, where the
local contact compliance is modelled by means of linear springs and Coulomb law
is used to govern the friction phenomena.
  In the literature, when the HBM is applied to vibrating systems with joint
interfaces and the state-of-the-art contact model is used, an uncoupled
approach is mostly employed: the static governing equations are solved in
advance to compute the pre-stress effects and then the dynamic governing
equations are solved to predict the vibration amplitude of the system. As a
result, the HBM steady-state solution may lead to a poor correlation with the
DTI solution, where static and dynamic loads are accounted for simultaneously.
  In this paper, the HBM performances are investigated by comparing the
uncoupled approach to a fully coupled static/dynamic approach. In order to
highlight the main differences between the two approaches, a lumped parameter
system, characterized by a single friction contact, is considered in order to
show the different levels of accuracy that the proposed approaches can provide
for different configurations.

However, previous Meta learning approaches expose problems:
  1) they ignored the importance of attention mechanism for the Meta learner;
  2) they didn't give the Meta learner the ability of well using the past
knowledge which can help to express images into high representations, resulting
in that the Meta learner has to solve few shot learning task directly from the
original high dimensional RGB images.
  In this paper, we argue that the attention mechanism and the past knowledge
are crucial for the Meta learner, and the Meta learner should be trained on
high representations of the RGB images instead of directly on the original
ones. Based on these arguments, we propose two methods: Attention augmented
Meta Learning (AML) and Representation based and Attention augmented Meta

ability by explicitly embedding an attention model into its network. The method
RAML aims to give the Meta learner the ability of leveraging the past learned

into high representations, and help the Meta learner to perform well. Extensive

considered computationally challenging since it is defined as a nested

expectation with respect to $\theta$. In fact, the standard, nested Monte Carlo
method requires a total computational cost of $O(\varepsilon^{-3})$ to achieve
a root-mean-square accuracy of $\varepsilon$. In this paper we develop an
efficient algorithm to estimate the expected information gain by applying a
multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method. To be precise, we introduce an antithetic

years. While these developments have improved experiences for individual users,
design of multi-user interfaces still remains a challenge. A relatively
unexplored area in this context, is enabling multiple users to enjoy shared
viewing (e.g. deciding on movies to watch together). In particular, the
challenge is to design an intelligent system which would enable viewers to
explore together shows or movies they like, seamlessly. This is a complex
design problem, as it requires the system to (i) assess affinities of
individual users (movies or genres), (ii) combine individual preferences taking
into account user-user interactions, and (iii) be non-intrusive simultaneously.
The proposed system VoCoG, is an end-to-end intelligent system for
collaborative viewing. VoCoG incorporates an online recommendation algorithm,
efficient methods for analyzing natural conversation and a graph-based method
to fuse preferences of multiple users. It takes user conversation as input,
making it non-intrusive. A usability survey of the system indicates that the
system provides a good experience to the users as well as relevant
recommendations. Further analysis of the usage data reveals insights about the
nature of conversation during the interaction sessions, final consensus among
the users as well as ratings of varied user groups.

way that we can jointly utilize face, head, body, audio features, and so on. In
this paper, we introduce iQIYI-VID, the largest video dataset for multi-modal

These video clips are extracted from 400K hours of online videos of various
types, ranging from movies, variety shows, TV series, to news broadcasting. All
video clips pass through a careful human annotation process, and the error rate
of labels is lower than 0.2\%. We evaluated the state-of-art models of face
recognition, person re-identification, and speaker recognition on the iQIYI-VID
dataset. Experimental results show that these models are still far from being
perfect for the task of person identification in the wild. We proposed a
Multi-modal Attention module to fuse multi-modal features that can improve
person identification considerably. We have released the dataset online to
promote multi-modal person identification research.

unaccessible ground-state-coupling is not needed. Only the shapes and phases of
the initial adiabatic classical-field pulse are modified with the aid of
effective two-level systems based on the counterdiabatic driving. The speed and
robustness against decay of these schemes are discussed and compared. In
addition, our work enriches the study of the speeded-up geometric computation
in $\Lambda$-type three-level system and can be applied to various experimental

  Categories",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fine-grained classification remains a very challenging problem, because of
the absence of well-labeled training data caused by the high cost of annotating
a large number of fine-grained categories. In the extreme case, given a set of
test categories without any well-labeled training data, the majority of
existing works can be grouped into the following two research directions: 1)
crawl noisy labeled web data for the test categories as training data, which is
dubbed as webly supervised learning; 2) transfer the knowledge from auxiliary
categories with well-labeled training data to the test categories, which
corresponds to zero-shot learning setting. Nevertheless, the above two research
directions still have critical issues to be addressed. For the first direction,
web data have noisy labels and considerably different data distribution from
test data. For the second direction, zero-shot learning is struggling to
achieve compelling results compared with conventional supervised learning. The
issues of the above two directions motivate us to develop a novel approach
which can jointly exploit both noisy web training data from test categories and
well-labeled training data from auxiliary categories. In particular, on one
hand, we crawl web data for test categories as noisy training data. On the
other hand, we transfer the knowledge from auxiliary categories with
well-labeled training data to test categories by virtue of free semantic
information (e.g., word vector) of all categories. Moreover, given the fact
that web data are generally associated with additional textual information
(e.g., title and tag), we extend our method by using the surrounding textual
information of web data as privileged information. Extensive experiments show
the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

inverse that loses derivatives and may blow up when the perturbation parameter
$\epsilon$ goes to zero. These equations are of the form $F_\epsilon(u)=v$ with
$F_\epsilon(0)=0$, $v$ small and given, $u$ small and unknown. The main
difference with the by now classical Nash-Moser algorithm is that, instead of
using a regularized Newton scheme, we solve a sequence of Galerkin problems
thanks to a topological argument. As a consequence, in our estimates there are
no quadratic terms. For problems without perturbation parameter, our results
require weaker regularity assumptions on $F$ and $v$ than earlier ones, such as
those of Hormander. For singularly perturbed functionals, we allow $v$ to be
larger than in previous works. To illustrate this, we apply our method to a
nonlinear Schrodinger Cauchy problem with concentrated initial data studied by
Texier-Zumbrun, and we show that our result improves significantly on theirs.

characterize the points belonging to such set as Nash equilibria of the

discussed so far as potential candidates for physics beyond the Standard Model.
In this work, we study the minimal versions of these gauge theories, where
three right-handed neutrinos as well as a single U(1)$_{L_\alpha - L_\beta}$
symmetry breaking Higgs field---an SU(2)$_L$ singlet or doublet---are
introduced. In these minimal models, the neutrino mass terms are constrained by
the gauge symmetry, which result in the two-zero texture or two-zero minor
structure of neutrino mass matrices. Such restrictive forms of neutrino mass
matrices lead to non-trivial predictions for the neutrino oscillation
parameters as well as the size of the mass eigenvalues. We find that due to
this restriction the minimal gauged U(1)$_{L_\alpha - L_\beta}$ models are
either incompatible with the observed values of the neutrino parameters or in
strong tension with the Planck 2018 limit on the sum of the neutrino masses.
Only the U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model with an SU(2)$_L$ singlet
U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$-breaking field barely evades the limit, which can be
tested in the future neutrino experiments.

complex dielectric function (CDF). However, spurious contributions
traditionally not considered in this framework typically impact low-loss EELS
modifying the spectral shapes and precluding the correct measurement and
retrieval of the dielectric information. A relativistic KKA algorithm is able
to account for the bulk and surface radiative-loss contributions to low-loss
EELS, revealing the correct dielectric properties. Using a synthetic low-loss
EELS model, we propose some modifications on the naive implementation of this

shape and smoothness of the correction term. Additionally, our efficient
numerical integration methodology allows processing hyperspectral datasets in a
reasonable amount of time. Harnessing these abilities, we show how simultaneous
relativistic KKA processing of several spectra can share information to produce

(CSE) of TX Psc in CO(2-1) emission and investigate the counterpart to the

irregular, and elliptical detached molecular shell around TX Psc, which
coincides with the dust emission. This is the first discovery of a
non-spherically symmetric detached shell, raising questions about the shaping
of detached shells. Conclusions. We investigate possible shaping mechanisms for
elliptical detached shells and find that in the case of TX Psc, stellar
rotation of 2 km/s can lead to a non-uniform mass-loss rate and velocity
distribution from stellar pole to equator, recreating the elliptical CSE. We
discuss the possible scenarios for increased stellar momentum, enabling the

problem with a large number of terms. The current practice in neural network
optimization is to rely on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm or
its adaptive variants. However, SGD requires a hand-designed schedule for the
learning rate. In addition, its adaptive variants tend to produce solutions
that generalize less well on unseen data than SGD with a hand-designed
schedule. We present an optimization method that offers empirically the best of
both worlds: our algorithm yields good generalization performance while
requiring only one hyper-parameter. Our approach is based on a composite
proximal framework, which exploits the compositional nature of deep neural
networks and can leverage powerful convex optimization algorithms by design.
Specifically, we employ the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for SVM, which computes
an optimal step-size in closed-form at each time-step. We further show that the
descent direction is given by a simple backward pass in the network, yielding
the same computational cost per iteration as SGD. We present experiments on the
CIFAR and SNLI data sets, where we demonstrate the significant superiority of
our method over Adam, Adagrad, as well as the recently proposed BPGrad and
AMSGrad. Furthermore, we compare our algorithm to SGD with a hand-designed

and across neurons before settling to a steady-state. While classical
population coding theory disregards the temporal dimension, recent works have
argued that trajectories of transient activity can be particularly informative
about stimulus identity and may form the basis of computations through
dynamics. Yet the dynamical mechanisms needed to generate a population code
based on transient trajectories have not been fully elucidated. Here we examine
transient coding in a broad class of high-dimensional linear networks of
recurrently connected units. We start by reviewing a well-known result that
leads to a distinction between two classes of networks: networks in which all
inputs lead to weak, decaying transients, and networks in which specific inputs
elicit strongly amplified transient responses and are mapped onto orthogonal
output states during the dynamics. Theses two classes are simply distinguished
based on the spectrum of the symmetric part of the connectivity matrix. For the
second class of networks, which is a sub-class of non-normal networks, we
provide a procedure to identify transiently amplified inputs and the
corresponding readouts. We first apply these results to standard
randomly-connected and two-population networks. We then build minimal, low-rank
networks that robustly implement trajectories mapping a specific input onto a
specific output state. Finally, we demonstrate that the capacity of the
obtained networks increases proportionally with their size.

phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems. The discovery of CMR in
manganese oxide compounds has developed the science of strong coupling among
charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom. CMR is also attracting scientists
from the viewpoint of possible applications to sensors, memories, and so on.
However, no application using CMR effect has been achieved so far, partly
because the CMR materials which satisfy all of the required conditions for the
application, namely, high operating temperature, low operating magnetic field,
and sharp resistive change, have not been discovered. Here we report a
resistance change of more than two-orders of magnitude at a magnetic field
lower than 2 T near 300 K in an A-site ordered NdBaMn_2_O_6_ crystal. When
temperature and a magnetic field sweep from insulating (metallic) phase to
metallic (insulating) phase, the insulating (metallic) conduction changes to
the metallic (insulating) conduction within 1 K and 0.5 T, respectively. The
CMR is ascribed to the melting of the charge ordering. The entropy change which
is estimated from the B-T phase diagram is smaller than what is expected for
the charge and orbital ordering. The suppression of the entropy change is
attributable to the loss of the short range ferromagnetic fluctuation of Mn
spin moments, which an important key of the high temperature and low magnetic

used in a wide temperature range applicable to heavy quark systems in heavy ion

parton scattering as expected in the quasifree approximation, while it is the
gluo-dissociation at low temperature. By comparing with the momentum diffusion
coefficient of a heavy quark, we discuss possible O(g) corrections to the

can induce the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI). This process could be
important in coronal heating because it leads to dissipation of energy at small
spatial-scale plasma interactions. Meanwhile, small amplitude decayless
oscillations in coronal loops have been discovered recently in observations of
SDO/AIA. We model such oscillations in coronal loops and study wave heating
effects, considering a kink and Alfv{\'e}n driver separately and a mixed driver
at the bottom of flux tubes. Both the transverse and Alfv{\'e}n oscillations
can lead to the KHI. Meanwhile, the Alfv{\'e}n oscillations established in
loops will experience phase mixing. Both processes will generate small
spatial-scale structures, which can help the dissipation of wave energy.
Indeed, we observe the increase of internal energy and temperature in loop
regions. The heating is more pronounced for the simulation containing the mixed
kink and Alfv{\'e}n driver. This means that the mixed wave modes can lead to a
more efficient energy dissipation in the turbulent state of the plasma and that
the KHI eddies act as an agent to dissipate energy in other wave modes.
Furthermore, we also obtained forward modelling results using the FoMo code. We
obtained forward models which are very similar to the observations of decayless
oscillations. Due to the limited resolution of instruments, neither Alfv{\'e}n
modes nor the fine structures are observable. Therefore, this numerical study
shows that Alfv{\'e}n modes probably can co-exist with kink modes, leading to
enhanced heating.

  Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-19)",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Attributed network embedding has received much interest from the research
community as most of the networks come with some content in each node, which is
also known as node attributes. Existing attributed network approaches work well
when the network is consistent in structure and attributes, and nodes behave as
expected. But real world networks often have anomalous nodes. Typically these
outliers, being relatively unexplainable, affect the embeddings of other nodes
in the network. Thus all the downstream network mining tasks fail miserably in
the presence of such outliers. Hence an integrated approach to detect anomalies
and reduce their overall effect on the network embedding is required.
  Towards this end, we propose an unsupervised outlier aware network embedding
algorithm (ONE) for attributed networks, which minimizes the effect of the
outlier nodes, and hence generates robust network embeddings. We align and
jointly optimize the loss functions coming from structure and attributes of the
network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generic network
embedding approach which incorporates the effect of outliers for an attributed
network without any supervision. We experimented on publicly available real
networks and manually planted different types of outliers to check the
performance of the proposed algorithm. Results demonstrate the superiority of
our approach to detect the network outliers compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches. We also consider different downstream machine learning applications
on networks to show the efficiency of ONE as a generic network embedding
technique. The source code is made available at

algorithm to estimate densities taking more than a single entity into account,
and to recover clusters that are not well-separated or have different
densities. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets show our
proposed algorithm outperforms DBSCAN and its recent variant ISDBSCAN.

models of sympatric speciation leading to the formation of new species without
geographical isolation, are based on the niche hypothesis: the diversification
of the population is induced by the competition for a limited set of the
available resources. On the other hand, neutral models of evolution have shown
that stochastic forces are sufficient to generate coexistence of different
species. In this work, we bring this dichotomy to the context of species
formation, and we study how neutral and niche forces contribute to sympatric

population of individuals with asexual reproduction whose inherited characters

high-order attributes (AEEN-HOA) is proposed for going further to solve the
challenging ZSL/GZSL task. AEEN-HOA consists of two branches, i.e., the upper
stream is capable of erasing some initially discovered regions, then the
high-order attribute supervision is incorporated to characterize the
relationship between the class attributes. Meanwhile, the bottom stream is
trained by taking the current background regions to train the same attribute.
As far as we know, it is the first time of introducing the erasing operations
into the ZSL task. In addition, we first propose a class attribute activation
map for the visualization of ZSL output, which shows the relationship between
class attribute feature and attention map. Experiments on four standard
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of AEEN-HOA framework.

robustness, the advancements in tracking accuracy have been limited. As the
focus has been directed towards the development of powerful classifiers, the
problem of accurate target state estimation has been largely overlooked. In
fact, most trackers resort to a simple multi-scale search in order to estimate
the target bounding box. We argue that this approach is fundamentally limited
since target estimation is a complex task, requiring high-level knowledge about
the object.
  We address this problem by proposing a novel tracking architecture,
consisting of dedicated target estimation and classification components. High
level knowledge is incorporated into the target estimation through extensive
offline learning. Our target estimation component is trained to predict the
overlap between the target object and an estimated bounding box. By carefully
integrating target-specific information, our approach achieves previously
unseen bounding box accuracy. We further introduce a classification component
that is trained online to guarantee high discriminative power in the presence
of distractors. Our final tracking framework sets a new state-of-the-art on
five challenging benchmarks. On the new large-scale TrackingNet dataset, our
tracker ATOM achieves a relative gain of 15% over the previous best approach,
while running at over 30 FPS. Code and models are available at

several well-known databases used in SV with artificially noised and

Carrying out visual place recognition across these local maps the system can
identify when two maps overlap in space, providing an inter-map constraint from

resulting pose constraints, our system performs map merging, allowing multiple
cameras to fuse their measurements into a single shared reconstruction. The
advantage of this approach is that it avoids replication of structures
subsequent to loop closures, where multiple cameras traverse the same regions

molecular level understanding of such interfaces water monomer adsorption on
graphene is a fundamental and representative system. This system is
particularly interesting as it calls for an accurate treatment of electron
correlation effects, as well as posing a practical challenge to experiments.
Here, we employ many-body electronic structure methodologies that can be
rigorously converged and thus provide faithful references for the
molecule-surface interaction. In particular, we use diffusion Monte-Carlo
(DMC), coupled cluster (CCSD(T)), as well as the random phase approximation
(RPA) to calculate the strength of the interaction between water and an
extended graphene surface. We establish excellent, sub-chemical, agreement
between the complementary high-level methodologies, and an adsorption energy
estimate in the most stable configuration of approximately -100\,meV is
obtained. We also find that the adsorption energy is rather insensitive to the
orientation of the water molecule on the surface, despite different binding
motifs involving qualitatively different interfacial charge reorganisation. In
producing the first demonstrably accurate adsorption energies for water on
graphene this work also resolves discrepancies amongst previously reported
values for this widely studied system. It also paves the way for more accurate

engineering. We systematically analyze the important figures of merit such as
modal purity and heralding efficiency to investigate the feasibility of this

phase engineering to optimize the figures of merit and apply numerical
simulations to a fiber system. Both modal purity and efficiency are improved
simultaneously. Furthermore, a novel multi-stage nonlinear interferometer is
proposed and shown to achieve more precise state engineering for near-ideal
single-mode operation and near-unity efficiency. We also extend the study to
the case of high gain in the four-wave mixing process for the spectral
engineering of quantum entanglement in continuous variables. Our investigation
provides a new approach for precisely tailoring the spectral property of
quantum light sources, especially, photon pairs can be engineered to
simultaneously possess the features of high purity, high collection efficiency,
high brightness, and high flexibility in wavelength and bandwidth selection.

the broad assumption that the coalescent has no dust component, and maximal
external branches under further regularity assumptions. As it transpires, the
crucial characteristic is the coalescent's rate of decrease $\mu(b)$, $b\geq

$n/\mu(n)$, where $n$ denotes the sample size. This result, in addition to the
asymptotic independence of several typical external lengths hold in full

function. Both entropy and fractal dimension can be employed to characterize
complex spatial systems such as cities and regions. Despite the inherent
connect between entropy and fractal dimension, they have different application
scopes and directions in urban studies. This paper focuses on exploring how to
convert entropy measurement into fractal dimension for the spatial analysis of
scale-free urban phenomena using ideas from scaling. Urban systems proved to be
random prefractal and multifractals systems. The entropy of fractal cities
bears two typical properties. One is the scale dependence. Entropy values of
urban systems always depend on the scales of spatial measurement. The other is
entropy conservation. Different fractal parts bear the same entropy value. Thus
entropy cannot reflect the spatial heterogeneity of fractal cities in theory.
If we convert the generalized entropy into multifractal spectrums, the problems
of scale dependence and entropy homogeneity can be solved to a degree for urban
spatial analysis. The essence of scale dependence is the scaling in cities, and
the spatial heterogeneity of cities can be characterized by multifractal
scaling. This study may be helpful for the students to describe and understand
spatial complexity of cities.

RFMIOs as a fundamental tool for modeling, analyzing and re-engineering the
complex mechanisms of protein production. In these networks, the output of each
RFMIO may be divided, using connection weights, between several inputs of other
RFMIOs. We show that under quite general feedback connections the network has
two important properties: (1) it admits a unique steady-state and every
trajectory converges to this steady-state, and (2) the problem of how to
determine the connection weights so that the network steady-state output is
maximized is a convex optimization problem. These mathematical properties make
these networks highly suitable as models of various phenomena: property (1)
means that the behavior is predictable and ordered, and property (2) means that
determining the optimal weights is numerically tractable even for large-scale

additional useful property, namely, that there exists a spectral representation

one hand, the calculation step size can be greatly increased by utilizing a new
XT's coupling matrix. On the other hand, the calculation of XT can be further
accelerated by down-sampling XT's coupling matrix in frequency domain. The XT
power and average occurrence distance should be set manually based on the
existing XT model to describe the frequency-dependent XT the same as a real
WC-MCF. We numerically and experimentally observed that XT's de-correlation
bandwidth decreases with relative time delay (RTD) by fractional linear
function. The range of validity of the proposed channel model is also discussed
with different walk-off and coupling strength. We believe the proposed
efficient channel model can provide great help for analysis and optimization of
homogeneous WC-MCF based optical communication systems.

  Circulation Model","Updated references",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The atmosphere of Venus is characterized by strong superrotation, in which
the wind velocities at cloud heights are around 60 times faster than the
surface rotation rate. The reasons for this strong superrotation are still not
well understood. Motions in the atmosphere below the thick cloud deck are hard
to determine remotely and in-situ measurements of the circulation below 40 km
altitude are scarce. No model to date has been able to simulate superrotating
winds with magnitudes comparable with those measured by entry probes, in the
dense atmosphere between the surface and the clouds. However, important
information on the dynamics and circulation of Venus' atmosphere can be
determined by studying the atmosphere at cloud levels, where there are
significantly more measurements than in the sub-cloud region, including the
many recent observations made during the Venus Express and Akatsuki missions.
In this work we describe a new Venus Middle atmosphere general circulation
Model (VMM) to study the dynamics of the atmosphere at cloud altitudes. The
model simulates the atmosphere from just below cloud deck to around 95 km
altitude. We present simulations using the VMM with a simplified Newtonian
cooling radiation scheme. Sensitivity studies have been performed to determine
the most appropriate values for model parameters and the model has been
validated by comparison with observations, including those from Venus Express
and Akatsuki. The validated model provides some constraints on parameters which
are poorly measured close to the boundary such as the mean winds and
temperatures, and provides a basis for further investigations of the dynamics
of Venus' cloud-level atmosphere. In future studies we will also investigate
the influence of atmospheric waves, such as Kelvin and Rossby waves, to
determine the role they play in generating the poorly-understood cloud-level
structure at all latitudes.

tackle these problems by generating the minority class samples to balance the
distributions between majority and minority classes. However, many of
oversampling methods are inappropriate that they cannot generate effective and
useful minority class samples according to different distributions of data,
which further complicate the process of learning samples. Thus, this paper
proposes a novel adaptive oversampling technique: EM-based Weighted Minority

identify hard-to-learn informative minority fault samples and Expectation

produces a polarization signal which is strongly sensitive to the geometry of
the scattering medium (i.e. the hot corona) and of the radiation field. MoCA
(Monte Carlo code for Comptonisation in Astrophysics) is a versatile code which
allows for different geometries and configurations to be tested for Compton
scattering in compact objects. A single photon approach is considered as well
as polarisation and Klein-Nishina effects. In this work, we selected four
different geometries for the scattering electrons cloud above the accretion
disc, namely an extended slab, an extended spheroid and two compact spheroids.
We discuss the first application of the MoCA model to reproduce the hard X-ray
primary continuum of the bare Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 120, using different
geometries for the hot corona above the accretion disc. We report on the
spectral analysis of the simultaneous 2013 and 2014 XMM-Newton and NuSTAR
observations of the source. A general agreement is found between the best fit
values of the hot coronal parameters obtained with MoCA and the ones inferred
using other Comptonisation codes from the literature. The expected polarization
signal from the best fits with MoCA is then presented and discussed, in view of
the launch in 2021 of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We find
that none of the tested geometries for the hot corona (extended slab and
extended/compact spheroids) can be statistically preferred, based on
spectroscopy solely. In the future, an IXPE observation less than 1 Ms long
will clearly distinguish between an extended slab or a spherical hot corona.

mediated by their common linear environment. If the environment is out of
equilibrium the resulting interaction violates Onsager relations and cannot be
described by a Hamiltonian. In simple terms the action of system A on system B
does not necessarily produce a back-action. We derive general quantum equations
describing the situation and analyze in details their classical correspondence.
Changing the properties of the environment one can easily change and engineer
the resulting interaction. It is tempting to use this for quantum manipulation
of the systems. However the resulting quantum gate is not always unitary and
may induce a loss of quantum coherence. For a relevant example we consider
systems A and B to be spins of arbitrary values and arrange the interaction to
realize an analogue of the two-qubit CNOT gate. The direction of spin A
controls the rotation of spin B while spin A is not rotated experiencing no
back-action from spin B. We solve the quantum dynamics equations and analyze
the purity of the resulting density matrix. The resulting purity essentially
depends on the initial states of the systems. We attempt to find a universal
characteristics of the purity optimizing it for the worst choice of initial
states. For both spins $s_A=s_B=1/2$, the optimized purity is bounded by 1/2
irrespective of the details of the gate. We also study in detail the
semiclassical limit of large spins. In this case the optimized purity is
bounded by $(1+\pi/2)^{-1}\approx0.39$. This is much better than the typical
purity of a large spin state $\sim s^{-1}$. We conclude that although the
quantum manipulation without back-action inevitably causes decoherence of the
quantum states the actual purity of the resulting state can be optimized and

influence on the two-level system dynamics, which is not anticipated by simpler
models. The characterization of photon indistinguishability in the pulsed
excitation regime is usually done by measuring the value of the zero-delay
intensity correlation obtained with a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer. We show
that this figure is irrelevant in the cw excitation regime and we introduce the

yields the solution of the computational problem. However, equivalence with the

involving more than two subsystems. Natural interactions are only two-local,
hence the construction or simulation of higher order couplers is indispensable
for a universal quantum annealer. Also, four-local couplers allow compact
implementation of error correction with the Bacon-Shor code. Four-local

even without assuming the presence of extreme magnetic fields. Effects of small
pressure anisotropy on the Hydrogen burning limit in low mass stars are also
briefly commented upon. It is shown that here the isotropic case can predict a
theoretical lower bound on the scalar tensor parameter, in addition to a known
upper bound.

of a few tens of percent over expectations computed using extrapolation of
hadronic interaction models tuned to accommodate LHC data. Very recently, we
proposed an explanation for the muon excess assuming the formation of a
deconfined quark matter (fireball) state in central collisions of
ultrarelativistic cosmic rays with air nuclei. At the first stage of its
evolution the fireball contains gluons as well as $u$ and $d$ quarks. The very
high baryochemical potential inhibits gluons from fragmenting into $u \bar u$
and $d \bar d$, and so they fragment predominantly into $s \bar s$ pairs. In
the hadronization which follows this leads to the strong suppression of pions
and hence photons, but allows heavy hadrons to be emitted carrying away

particles in active matter, membranes in biological systems, and the
aggregation of soot particles in process engineering. ESPResSo also includes
solvers for hydrodynamic and electrokinetic problems, both on the continuum and
on the explicit particle level. Since our last description of version 3.1

propose a descriptor - entropy forming ability - for addressing
synthesizability from first principles. The formalism, based on the energy
distribution spectrum of randomized calculations, captures the accessibility of
equally-sampled states near the ground state and quantifies configurational
disorder capable of stabilizing high-entropy homogeneous phases. The
methodology is applied to disordered refractory 5-metal carbides - promising
candidates for high-hardness applications. The descriptor correctly predicts
the ease with which compositions can be experimentally synthesized as rock-salt
high-entropy homogeneous phases, validating the ansatz, and in some cases,
going beyond intuition. Several of these materials exhibit hardness up to 50%
higher than rule of mixtures estimations. The entropy descriptor method has the
potential to accelerate the search for high-entropy systems by rationally
combining first principles with experimental synthesis and characterization.

lives. A lack of interactions can explain how individuals develop depressive
symptoms, but depressive symptoms can also explain how individuals engage in
social interactions. Understanding in detail how depression affects
individuals' social interaction networks is important to break this vicious
cycle of social isolation and depression. This article tackles two central
methodological challenges in understanding the micro-level mechanisms between
depressive symptoms and social interactions. The first contribution is the
application of novel data collection strategies that employ RFID sensors to
record behavioral data on interpersonal interaction, which we combine with
self-reported depressive symptoms and sociometric data on friendship relations.
The second contribution is the analysis of these data with statistical social
network methodology that allows testing hypotheses on the duration of
interactions between pairs of individuals. With this unique approach, we test
four social network hypotheses in an empirical setting of two first-year
undergraduate student cohorts (N(pairs) = 2,454, N(individuals) = 123) spending
a weekend together in a remote camp house. We conclude that depressive symptoms
are associated with (1) spending less time in social interaction, (2) spending
time with similarly depressed others, (3) spending time in pair-wise
interactions rather than group interactions, and with (4) spending more time
with reciprocal friends (but not with unilaterally perceived friends). Our
findings offer new insights into social consequences of depressive symptoms and
call for the development of social network-oriented intervention strategies to
prevent depressed individuals from being socially isolated.

only contributions coming from dark matter were considered, which is assumed to

Nevertheless, going to smaller scales, also baryonic contributions have to be

obtained from Eulerian perturbation theory. A subsequent paper will resolve the
problem of coupling both theories describing dark and baryonic matter,
respectively, to gain a full model of cosmic matter. Even though our focus is

phases, phase transition in MoTe$_2$ can occur with an unprecedented small
amount of external perturbations. In this work, we used density functional
theory to predict critical strain and electrostatic voltage required to control
the phase transition of 3d and 4d metal doped MoTe$_2$. We found that small
doping contents dramatically affect the relative energies of MoTe$_2$ crystal
phases and can largely reduced the energy input to trigger the transition,
compared to pristine case. Moreover, the kinetics corresponding to the phase
transition in the proposed doped materials are several order of magnitude
faster than in MoTe$_2$. For example, we predict 6.3 \% Mn doped MoTe$_2$ to
switch phase under 1.19 V gate voltage in less than 1 $\mu$s with an input
energy of 0.048 aJ/nm$^3$. Due to the presence of dopant, the controlled change
of phase is often complemented with a change in magnetic moment leading to

stronger-than-linear increase of the self-normalized J/$\psi$ yield with
multiplicity; several models, based on initial or final state effects, have
been able to describe the observed behaviour. In this paper, the microscopic
reasons for this behaviour, like the role of multiple parton interactions,
colour reconnections and auto-correlations are investigated. It is observed
that the stronger-than-linear increase and the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm

can be attributed to auto-correlation effects only. In absence of
auto-correlation effects, the increase of the yield of J/$\psi$ with
multiplicity -- and in general for all hard processes -- is weaker than linear
for multiplicities exceeding about three times the mean multiplicity. The
possibility of disentangling auto-correlation effects from other physical
phenomena by measuring the charged-particle multiplicity in different
pseudo-rapidity and azimuthal regions relative to the J/$\psi$ direction is
investigated. In this regard, it is suggested to extend the experimental
measurements of J/$\psi$ production as a function of the charged-particle

Klein group and CP, while a Z_3 and a Z_{16} symmetry are preserved among
charged leptons and down quarks, respectively. If the Klein group in the
neutrino sector is further broken down to a single Z_2 symmetry, we obtain
predictions for all lepton mixing parameters in terms of one real quantity,
whose size is determined by the value of the reactor mixing angle. The Dirac
and Majorana phases are fixed, in particular sin (delta) = -0.936. A sum rule,
relating these CP phases and the reactor and atmospheric mixing angles,
theta_{13} and theta_{23}, is given. In the quark sector, we have for the
Cabibbo angle theta_C= sin (pi/16) = 0.195 after the first step of symmetry
breaking. This is brought into full accordance with experimental data with the
second step of symmetry breaking, where either the Z_{16} group is broken to a
Z_8 symmetry in the down quark sector or the Klein group to one Z_2 symmetry
only among up quarks. The other two quark mixing angles are generated in the
third and last symmetry breaking step, when the residual symmetries in the up

and down quarks, the amount of CP violation in the quark sector is determined
by the lepton sector and explaining the current neutrino oscillation data
entails that the Jarlskog invariant J_{CP}^q is in very good agreement with
experimental findings. Lastly, a sum rule is derived that contains the CP phase
delta^q and theta_C of the quark sector and the lepton mixing parameters

system. The triplet consists of an inner white dwarf binary and a wider
companion. Using Gaia DR2 photometry and astrometry combined with our follow-up
spectroscopy, we derive effective temperatures, surface gravities, masses and
cooling ages of the three components. All three white dwarfs have pure-hydrogen
(DA) atmospheres, masses of 0.60-0.63 Msun and cooling ages of 40-290 Myr. We
adopt eight initial-to-final mass relations to estimate the main sequence
progenitor masses (which we find to be similar for the three components,
1.6-2.6 Msun) and lifetimes. The differences between the derived cooling times
and main sequence lifetimes agree for most of the adopted initial-to-final mass
relations, hence the three white dwarfs in J1953-1019 are consistent with
coeval evolution. Furthermore, we calculate the projected orbital separations
of the inner white dwarf binary (303.25 +- 0.01 au) and of the centre of mass
of the inner binary and the outer companion (6398.97 +- 0.09 au). From these
values, and taking into account a wide range of possible configurations for the
triplet to be currently dynamically stable, we analyse the future evolution of
the system. We find that a collision between the two inner white dwarfs due to
Lidov-Kozai oscillations is unlikely, though if it occurs it could result in a
sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernova explosion.

broad classes of functions can be solved privately and efficiently, assuming
the existence of a non-private oracle for solving the same problem. Our first
algorithm yields a privacy guarantee that is contingent on the correctness of
the oracle. We then give a reduction which applies to a class of heuristics
which we call certifiable, which allows us to convert oracle-dependent privacy
guarantees to worst-case privacy guarantee that hold even when the heuristic
standing in for the oracle might fail in adversarial ways. Finally, we consider
a broad class of functions that includes most classes of simple boolean
functions studied in the PAC learning literature, including conjunctions,
disjunctions, parities, and discrete halfspaces. We show that there is an
efficient algorithm for privately constructing synthetic data for any such

oracle-efficient algorithm for privately generating synthetic data for
contingency tables. The most intriguing question left open by our work is
whether or not every problem that can be solved differentially privately can be
privately solved with an oracle-efficient algorithm. While we do not resolve

governing equations for incompressible two-phase flows with different densities
and dynamic viscosities for the two fluids. The proposed scheme employs a
scalar-valued auxiliary energy variable in its formulation, and it satisfies a
discrete energy stability property. More importantly, the scheme is
computationally efficient. Within each time step, it computes two copies of the
flow variables (velocity, pressure, phase field function) by solving
individually a linear algebraic system involving a constant and
time-independent coefficient matrix for each of these field variables. The
coefficient matrices involved in these linear systems only need to be computed
once and can be pre-computed. Additionally, within each time step the scheme
requires the solution of a nonlinear algebraic equation about a {\em
scalar-valued number} using the Newton's method. The cost for this nonlinear
solver is very low, accounting for only a few percent of the total computation
time per time step, because this nonlinear equation is about a scalar number,
not a field function. Extensive numerical experiments have been presented for
several two-phase flow problems involving large density ratios and large
viscosity ratios. Comparisons with theory show that the proposed method
produces physically accurate results. Simulations with large time step sizes
demonstrate the stability of computations and verify the robustness of the
proposed method. An implication of this work is that energy-stable schemes for
two-phase problems can also become computationally efficient and competitive,
eliminating the need for expensive re-computations of coefficient matrices,

Several different approaches to automatic 3D annotation have been proposed to
overcome the limitations of traditional cephalometry. The purpose of this study
was to evaluate the accuracy of our newly-developed system using a deep
learning algorithm for automatic 3D cephalometric annotation. Methods: To
overcome current technical limitations, some measures were developed to
directly annotate 3D human skull data. Our deep learning-based model system
mainly consisted of a 3D convolutional neural network and image data
resampling. Results: The discrepancies between the referenced and predicted
coordinate values in three axes and in 3D distance were calculated to evaluate
system accuracy. Our new model system yielded prediction errors of 3.26, 3.18,

optimisation of individual utility functions are solitons that are therefore
endogenously generated. Hence for the classes of models here proposed, an
explicit correspondence between exogenous and endogenous interaction rules
ultimately producing similar collective effects can be explicitly constructed.
For both Gaussian and non-Gaussian environments our exact results unveil new
classes of exactly solvable mean-field games dynamics.

  Challenge. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1810.07003",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate localization and segmentation of intervertebral disc (IVD) is
crucial for the assessment of spine disease diagnosis. Despite the
technological advances in medical imaging, IVD localization and segmentation
are still manually performed, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. If,
in addition, multi-modal imaging is considered, the burden imposed on disease
assessments increases substantially. In this paper, we propose an architecture
for IVD localization and segmentation in multi-modal MRI, which extends the
well-known UNet. Compared to single images, multi-modal data brings
complementary information, contributing to better data representation and
discriminative power. Our contributions are three-fold. First, how to
effectively integrate and fully leverage multi-modal data remains almost
unexplored. In this work, each MRI modality is processed in a different path to
better exploit their unique information. Second, inspired by HyperDenseNet, the
network is densely-connected both within each path and across different paths,
granting the model the freedom to learn where and how the different modalities
should be processed and combined. Third, we improved standard U-Net modules by
extending inception modules with two dilated convolutions blocks of different
scale, which helps handling multi-scale context. We report experiments over the
data set of the public MICCAI 2018 Challenge on Automatic Intervertebral Disc
Localization and Segmentation, with 13 multi-modal MRI images used for training
and 3 for validation. We trained IVD-Net on an NVidia TITAN XP GPU with 16 GBs
RAM, using ADAM as optimizer and a learning rate of 10e-5 during 200 epochs.
Training took about 5 hours, and segmentation of a whole volume about 2-3
seconds, on average. Several baselines, with different multi-modal fusion
strategies, were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
architecture.

We obtained our photometric data with the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and

the first large, homogeneous sample of SNe Ic-BL from an untargeted survey.
Furthermore, given the high cadence of (i)PTF, most of these SNe were
discovered soon after explosion. We present K-corrected $Bgriz$ light curves of
these SNe, obtained through photometry on template-subtracted images. We
analyzed the shape of the $r$-band light curves, finding a correlation between
the decline parameter $\Delta m_{15}$ and the rise parameter $\Delta m_{-10}$.
We studied the SN colors and, based on $g-r$, we estimated the host-galaxy
extinction. Peak $r$-band absolute magnitudes have an average of $-18.6\pm0.5$
mag. We fit each $r$-band light curve with that of SN 1998bw (scaled and
stretched) to derive the explosion epochs. We computed the bolometric light
curves using bolometric corrections, $r$-band data, and $g-r$ colors. Expansion
velocities from Fe II were obtained by fitting spectral templates of SNe Ic.
Bolometric light curves and velocities at peak were fitted using the
semianalytic Arnett model to estimate ejecta mass $M_{\rm ej}$, explosion
energy $E_{K}$ and $^{56}$Ni mass $M(^{56}$Ni). We find average values of
$M_{\rm ej} = 4\pm3~{\rm M}_{\odot}$, $E_{K} = (7\pm6) \times 10^{51}~$erg, and
$M(^{56}$Ni) $= 0.31\pm0.16~{\rm M}_{\odot}$. We also estimated the degree of
$^{56}$Ni mixing using scaling relations derived from hydrodynamical models and
we find that all the SNe are strongly mixed. The derived explosion parameters
imply that at least 21% of the progenitors of SNe Ic-BL are compatible with
massive ($>28~{\rm M}_{\odot}$), possibly single stars, whereas at least 64%
might come from less massive stars in close binary systems.

can considerably improve the EE of the network. Also, the proposed low
complexity approach presents a performance close to the optimal solution but
with a significant reduced complexity.

cells of the root lattice A_n in n-dimensional space are the identical
rhombuses and equilateral triangles respectively.The prototiles obtained from
orthogonal projections of the Voronoi and Delaunay (Delone) cells of the root
lattice of the Coxeter-Weyl group W(a)_n are classified. Orthogonal projections
lead to various rhombuses and several triangles respectively some of which have
been extensively discussed in the literature in different contexts. For
example, rhombuses of the Voronoi cell of the root lattice A_4 projects onto
only two prototiles: thick and thin rhombuses of the Penrose tilings. Similarly
the Delone cells tiling the same root lattice projects onto two isosceles
Robinson triangles which also lead to Penrose tilings with kites and darts. We
point out that the Coxeter element of order h=n+1 and the dihedral subgroup of
order 2n plays a crucial role for h-fold symmetric aperiodic tilings of the
Coxeter plane. After setting the general scheme we give examples leading to
tilings with 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold,7-fold, 8-fold and 12-fold symmetries with
rhombic and triangular tilings of the plane which are useful in modelling the
quasicrystallography with 5-fold, 8-fold and 12-fold symmetries. The face
centered cubic (f.c.c.) lattice described by the root lattice A_(3)whose
Wigner-Seitz cell is the rhombic dodecahedron projects, as expected, onto a
square lattice with an h=4 fold symmetry.

  https://saiconference.com/IntelliSys",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been promising for many computer
vision problems due to their powerful capabilities to enhance the data for
training and test. In this paper, we leveraged GANs and proposed a new
architecture with a cascaded Single Shot Detector (SSD) for pedestrian
detection at distance, which is yet a challenge due to the varied sizes of
pedestrians in videos at distance. To overcome the low-resolution issues in
pedestrian detection at distance, DCGAN is employed to improve the resolution
first to reconstruct more discriminative features for a SSD to detect objects
in images or videos. A crucial advantage of our method is that it learns a
multi-scale metric to distinguish multiple objects at different distances under
one image, while DCGAN serves as an encoder-decoder platform to generate parts
of an image that contain better discriminative information. To measure the
effectiveness of our proposed method, experiments were carried out on the
Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) dataset, and it was
demonstrated that the proposed new architecture achieved a much better
detection rate, particularly on vehicles and pedestrians at distance, making it
highly suitable for smart cities applications that need to discover key objects
or pedestrians at distance.

need to control their usage and consumption of energy. This paper presents a
method which leverages the algorithm's performance and energy consumption. By
utilising Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, we provide an adaptive
framework, which continuously performs weak training in an energy-aware system.
We motivate this using a realistic example of residential localisation based on
Received Signal Strength (RSS). The method is cheap in terms of work-hours,
calibration and energy usage. It achieves this by utilising other sensors
available in the environment. These other sensors provide weak labels, which
are then used to employ the State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) algorithm
and train the model over time. Our approach is evaluated on a simulated
localisation environment and validated on a widely available pervasive health
dataset which facilitates realistic residential localisation using RSS. We show
that our method is cheaper to implement and requires less effort, whilst at the
same time providing a performance enhancement and energy savings over time.

Second, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). Experiments are performed by
complementing one of the HEF methods with one ALF method on 150000 pairs of
samples of the word ""AND"" cropped from handwritten notes written by 1500

CNLS equations are chaotified and a chaotic system is proposed. Numerical and
analytical methods are conducted on such system: (I) Phase projections are

variety of applications such as molecular property predictions, novel molecule
designs, and planning chemical reactions. Despite the rapid increase in the use
of state-of-the-art models and algorithms, deep neural network models often
produce poor predictions in real applications because model performance is
highly dependent on the quality of training data. In the field of molecular
analysis, data are mostly obtained from either complicated chemical experiments
or approximate mathematical equations, and then quality of data may be
questioned.In this paper, we quantify uncertainties of prediction using
Bayesian neural networks in molecular property predictions. We estimate both
model-driven and data-driven uncertainties, demonstrating the usefulness of
uncertainty quantification as both a quality checker and a confidence indicator
with the three experiments. Our results manifest that uncertainty
quantification is necessary for more reliable molecular applications and
Bayesian neural network models can be a practical approach.
