static anisotropic spherical stellar charged structures in the regime of
$f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity, where $\mathcal{G}$ is the Gauss Bonnet invariant.
The structure of particular charged stars is analyzed with the help of solution
obtained by Krori and Barua under different viable models in $f(\mathcal{G})$
gravity theory. The behavior of some physical aspects is investigated with the
help of plots and the viability of our modeling is analyzed through different
energy conditions. We have also studied some behavior of these realistic
charged compact stars and discuss some aspects like density variation,
evolution of stresses, different forces, stability of these stars, measure of
anisotropy, equation of state parameters and the distribution of charges.

in $\mathbf{R}^d$ is $d(d+1)/2$. Examples of sets of lines that saturate this
bound are only known to exist in dimensions $d=2,3,7$ or $23$. By considering
the additional property of incoherence, we prove that there exists a set of
equiangular lines that saturates the absolute bound and the incoherence bound
if and only if $d=2,3,7$ or $23$. This allows us classify all tight spherical
$5$-designs $X$ in $\mathbf{S}^{d-1}$, the unit sphere, with the property that
there exists a set of $d$ points in $X$ whose pairwise inner products are
positive.
  For a given angle $\kappa$, there exists a relative upper bound on the number
of equiangular lines in $\mathbf{R}^d$ with common angle $\kappa$. We prove
that classifying sets of lines that saturate this bound along with the
incoherence bound is equivalent to classifying certain quasi-symmetric designs,
which are combinatorial designs with two block intersection numbers. Given a
further natural assumption, we classify the known sets of lines that saturate
these two bounds. This family comprises of the lines mentioned above and the
maximal set of $16$ equiangular lines found in $\mathbf{R}^6$. There are
infinitely many known sets of lines that saturate the relative bound, so this
result is surprising. To shed some light on this, we identify the $E_8$ lattice
with the projection onto an $8$-dimensional subspace of a sublattice of the
Leech lattice defined by $276$ equiangular lines in $\mathbf{R}^{23}$. This
identification leads us to observe a correspondence between sets of equiangular
lines in small dimensions and the exceptional curves of del Pezzo surfaces.

mainly by the white dwarf (WD) compactness (mass-radius ratio, M/R) and, thus,
hard X-ray spectra can be used to constrain the WD mass. An accurate mass
estimate requires the finite size of the WD magnetosphere R_m to be taken into
the account. We suggested to derive it either directly from the observed break
frequency in power spectrum of X-ray or optical lightcurves of a polar, or
assuming the corotation. Here we apply this method to all IPs observed by
NuSTAR (10 objects) and Swift/BAT (35 objects). For the dwarf nova GK Per we
also observe a change of the break frequency with flux, which allows to
constrain the dependence of the magnetosphere radius on the mass-accretion
rate. For our analysis we calculated an additional grid of two-parameter (M and
R_m/R) model spectra assuming a fixed, tall height of the accretion column
H_sh/R=0.25, which is appropriate to determine WD masses in low mass-accretion
IPs like EX\,Hya. Using the Gaia Data Release 2 we obtain for the first time
reliable estimates of the mass-accretion rate and the magnetic field strength
at the WD surface for a large fraction of objects in our sample. We find that
most IPs accrete at rate of ~10^{-9} M_Sun/yr, and have magnetic fields in the
range 1--10 MG. The resulting WD mass average of our sample is 0.79 +/- 0.16
M_Sun, which is consistent with earlier estimates.

have established a procedure to extract pure AMPE and AEE contributions,
separated from other thermoelectric effects, for ferromagnetic thin films. The
measurements of the magnetic-field-angle $\theta_{\rm H}$ dependence of the LIT
images clearly show that the temperature modulation induced by the AMPE (AEE)
in the Ni films varies with the $\cos 2\theta_{\rm H}$ ($\cos \theta_{\rm H}$)
pattern, confirming the symmetry of the AMPE (AEE). The systematic LIT
measurements using various substrates show that the AMPE-induced temperature
modulation decreases with the increase in thermal conductivity of the
substrates, whereas the AEE-induced temperature modulation is almost
independent of the thermal conductivity, indicating that the heat loss into the
substrates plays an important role in determining the magnitude of the
AMPE-induced temperature modulation in thin films. Our experimental results
were reproduced by numerical calculations based on a two-dimensional finite

repertoire. In the sensory organs, where the anatomy of neural circuits is
highly structured, lateral inhibition sharpens contrast among stimulus
properties. The impact of inhibition on stimulus processing and the involvement
of lateral inhibition is less clear when activity propagates to the
less-structured relay stations. Here we take a synthetic approach to
disentangle the impacts of inhibition from that of specialized anatomy on the
repertoire of evoked activity patterns, and as a result, the network capacity
to uniquely represent different stimuli. To this aim, we blocked inhibition in
randomly rewired networks of cortical neurons in-vitro, and quantified response
variability and stimulus discrimination among stimuli provided at different
spatial loci, before and after the blockade. We show that blocking inhibition
quenches variability of responses evoked by repeated stimuli through any
spatial source; for all tested response features. Despite the sharpening role
of inhibition in the highly structured sensory organs, in these random networks
we find that blocking inhibition enhances stimulus discrimination between
spatial sources of stimulation, when based on response features that emphasize
the relation among spike times recorded through different electrodes. We
further show that under intact inhibition, responses to a given stimulus are a
noisy version of those revealed by blocking inhibition; such that intact
inhibition disrupts an otherwise coherent, wave propagation of activity.

numbers of \v{C}ech complexes treated as stochastic processes and formed from
random points in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. We
consider the case where the points of the \v{C}ech complex are generated by a
Poisson process with intensity $nf$ for a probability density $f$. We look at
the cases where the behavior of the connectivity radius of \v{C}ech complex
causes simplices of dimension greater than $k+1$ to vanish in probability, the
so-called sparse and Poisson regimes, as well when the connectivity radius is
on the order of $n^{-1/d}$, the critical regime. We establish limit theorems in
all of the aforementioned regimes, a central limit theorem for the sparse and
critical regimes, and a Poisson limit theorem for the Poisson regime. When the
connectivity radius of the \v{C}ech complex is $o(n^{-1/d})$, i.e., the sparse
and Poisson regimes, we can decompose the limiting processes into a
time-changed Brownian motion and a time-changed homogeneous Poisson process
respectively. In the critical regime, the limiting process is a centered
Gaussian process but has much more complicated representation, because the
\v{C}ech complex becomes highly connected with many topological holes of any
dimension.

these measures reveals a clear temporal evolution of art, marked by transitions
that agree with the main historical periods of art. Our research shows that
different artistic styles have a distinct average degree of entropy and
complexity, thus allowing a hierarchical organization and clustering of styles
according to these metrics. We have further verified that the identified groups
correspond well with the textual content used to qualitatively describe the
styles, and that the employed complexity-entropy measures can be used for an

providing best advice; asking all and only the relevant questions; monitoring

new regulations concerning recognising and reporting breaches of security. It
concludes that AI technology can support each of these four areas. The
requirements that GDPR (or organisations that need to comply with GDPR) state

heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) results in large power consumption which
can be reduced by utilizing harvested energy from scavenge sources. Recently, a
new layout for HCN with energy harvesting-SBSs (EH-SBSs) has been proposed to
reduce inter-cell interference and power consumption; and increase system
energy efficiency. In this paper, an energy efficient joint user association
and BS on-off scheme for an HCN having diverse energy source(s) is proposed,
which aims at utilizing the harvested energy efficiently in order to reduce the
on-grid power consumption. The scheme operates in two phases. First, it decides
which BS should be in off, sleep or active mode and iteratively updates its
transmit power based on energy arrival and consumption, to minimize
interference and on-grid power consumption. Secondly, for further reduction in
on-grid power consumption, the user discovers and associates itself with the
nearest available EH-SBS. The system energy consumption for the proposed scheme
is numerically evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results
reveal that the proposed scheme shows significantly better results as compared
to other schemes in the literature in terms of grid power consumption and
energy efficiency.

reflects itself in the boundary theory as the positivity and monotonicity of

than 35 years to determine precisely when $\mathcal{A} \otimes_\gamma

$\mathcal{A}$, in particular the case $\mathcal{A} = \ell_\infty$, has remained
unsolved. We solve this classical question for arbitrary $C^*$-algebras by
using von Neumann algebra and operator space methods, mainly relying on
versions of the (commutative and non-commutative) Grothendieck Theorem, and the
structure of completely bounded module maps. Establishing these links allows us
to show that $\mathcal{A} \otimes_\gamma \mathcal{A}$ is Arens regular if and
only if $\mathcal{A}$ has the Phillips property; equivalently, $\mathcal{A}$ is
scattered and has the Dunford--Pettis Property. A further equivalent condition
is that $\mathcal{A}^*$ has the Schur property, or, again equivalently, the
enveloping von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{A}^{**}$ is finite atomic, i.e., a
direct sum of matrix algebras. Hence, Arens regularity of $\mathcal{A}
\otimes_\gamma \mathcal{A}$ is encoded in the geometry of the $C^*$-algebra

we largely confined our studies to high pressure). We find that for our model

constants, in general they are themselves uncertain. A type of model is
presented where the uncertainty in the assigned systematic errors is taken into
account. Estimates of the systematic variances are modeled as gamma distributed
random variables. The resulting confidence intervals show interesting and
useful properties. For example, when averaging measurements to estimate their
mean, the size of the confidence interval increases for decreasing
goodness-of-fit, and averages have reduced sensitivity to outliers. The basic
properties of the model are presented and several examples relevant for
Particle Physics are explored.

is obtained by running a state-of-the-art VIO algorithm based on non-linear
factor graph optimization, which requires large irregularly structured memories
and heterogeneous computation flow. To reduce the energy consumption and
footprint, the entire VIO system is fully integrated on chip to eliminate
costly off-chip processing and storage. This work uses compression and exploits
both structured and unstructured sparsity to reduce on-chip memory size by
4.1$\times$. Parallelism is used under tight area constraints to increase
throughput by 43%. The chip is fabricated in 65nm CMOS, and can process
752$\times$480 stereo images from EuRoC dataset in real-time at 20 frames per
second (fps) consuming only an average power of 2mW. At its peak performance,
Navion can process stereo images at up to 171 fps and inertial measurements at
up to 52 kHz, while consuming an average of 24mW. The chip is configurable to
maximize accuracy, throughput and energy-efficiency trade-offs and to adapt to

schemes for shock-capturing in compressible turbulent flows. The proposed
scheme has better resolution property than previous WCNS's. This is achieved by
using a compact (or spatially implicit) form instead of the traditional fully
explicit form for the nonlinear interpolation. Since compact interpolation
schemes tend to have lower dispersion errors compared to explicit interpolation
schemes, the proposed scheme has the ability to resolve more fine-scale
features while still having the ability to provide sufficiently localized
dissipation to capture shocks and discontinuities robustly. Approximate
dispersion relation characteristics of this scheme are analyzed to show the
superior resolution properties of the scheme compared to other WCNS's of
similar orders of accuracy. Conservative and high-order accurate boundary
schemes are also proposed for non-periodic problems. Further, a new
conservative flux-difference form for compact finite difference schemes is
derived and allows for the use of positivity-preserving limiters for improved
robustness. Different test cases demonstrate the ability of this scheme to
capture discontinuities in a robust and stable manner while also localizing the
required numerical dissipation only to regions containing discontinuities and
very high wavenumber features and hence preserving smooth flow features better

the completeness without increasing the computational load. We propose a new
method to sample the Line Of Variations (LOV) with respect to the previously
one used in NEODyS. The step-size of the sampling is not uniform in the LOV
parameter, since the probability of each LOV segment between consecutive points
is kept constant. Moreover, the sampling interval has been extended to the
larger interval [-5,5] in the LOV parameter and a new decomposition scheme in
sub-returns is provided to deal with the problem of duplicated points in the
same return. The impact monitoring system CLOMON-2 has been upgraded with all
these features, resulting in a decrease of the generic completeness limit IP*
by a factor $\simeq 4$ and in an increase of the computational load by a factor
$\simeq 2$. Moreover, we statistically investigate the completeness actually
reached by the system with two different methods: a direct comparison with the
results of the independent system Sentry at JPL and an empirical power-law to
model the number of virtual impactors as a function of the impact probability.
We found empirically that the number of detected virtual impactors with
$IP>IP^*$ appears to grow according to a power-law, proportional to
$IP^{-2/3}$. An analytical model explaining this power-law is currently an open
problem, but we think it is related to the way the number of virtual impactors
within a time $t_{rel}$ from the first observed close approach accumulates, for
which we prove the existence of a power-law proportional to $t_{rel}^3$. The
power-law allows us to detect a loss of efficiency in the virtual impactors
search for impact probabilities near the generic completeness limit.

This is an important question due to the intense research activity for the past
decade on cuts from multiple rows of simplex tableau as well as on
lift-and-project cuts from non-split disjunctions. While it is known since
Balas and Perregaard (2003) that lift-and-project cuts from split disjunctions
are always equivalent to intersection cuts and consequently to such multi-row
cuts, Balas and Kis (2016) have recently shown that there is a necessary and
sufficient condition in the case of arbitrary disjunctions: a lift-and-project
cut is regular if, and only if, it corresponds to a regular basic solution of
the Cut Generating Linear Program (CGLP). This paper has four contributions.
First, we state a result that simplifies the verification of regularity for
basic CGLP solutions from Balas and Kis (2016). Second, we provide a
mixed-integer formulation that checks whether there is a regular CGLP solution
for a given cut that is regular in a broader sense, which also encompasses
irregular cuts that are implied by the regular cut closure. Third, we describe
a numerical procedure based on such formulation that identifies irregular
lift-and-project cuts. Finally, we use this method to evaluate how often
lift-and-project cuts from simple $t$-branch split disjunctions are irregular,

performing approximate Bayesian parameter estimation for simulation-based

intractable likelihood function of a carefully chosen summary statistic at a
parameter value with a multivariate normal distribution. The mean and
covariance matrix of this normal distribution are estimated from independent
simulations of the model. Due to the parametric assumption implicit in BSL, it
can be preferred to its non-parametric competitor, approximate Bayesian

is of interest. However, despite several successful applications of BSL, its
widespread use in scientific fields may be hindered by the strong normality
assumption. In this paper, we develop a semi-parametric approach to relax this
assumption to an extent and maintain the computational advantages of BSL
without any additional tuning. We test our new method, semiBSL, on several
challenging examples involving simulated and real data and demonstrate that
semiBSL can be significantly more robust than BSL and another approach in the

issue of local minima through global mixed-integer optimization and the issue
of non-uniqueness through learning the optimal value function (or cost-to-go)
rather than the optimal policy. To avoid the expense of solving the
mixed-integer programs to full global optimality, we instead solve them only
partially, extracting intervals containing the true cost-to-go from early
termination of the branch-and-bound algorithm. These interval samples are used
to weakly supervise the training of a neural net which approximates the true
cost-to-go. Online, we use that learned cost-to-go as the terminal cost of a
one-step model-predictive controller, which we solve via a small mixed-integer
optimization. We demonstrate the LVIS approach on a cart-pole system with walls
and a planar humanoid robot model and show that it can be applied to a
fundamentally hard problem in feedback control--control through contact.

while urban form has no characteristic length in many aspects. Urban area is a
measure of scale dependence, which indicates the scale-free distribution of
urban patterns. Thus, the urban description based on characteristic lengths
should be replaced by urban characterization based on scaling. Fractal geometry
is one powerful tool for scaling analysis of cities. Fractal parameters can be
defined by entropy and correlation functions. However, how to understand city
fractals is still a pending question. By means of logic deduction and ideas
from fractal theory, this paper is devoted to discussing fractals and fractal
dimensions of urban landscape. The main points of this work are as follows.
First, urban form can be treated as pre-fractals rather than real fractals, and
fractal properties of cities are only valid within certain scaling ranges.
Second, the topological dimension of city fractals based on urban area is 0,
thus the minimum fractal dimension value of fractal cities is equal to or
greater than 0. Third, fractal dimension of urban form is used to substitute
urban area, and it is better to define city fractals in a 2-dimensional
embedding space, thus the maximum fractal dimension value of urban form is 2. A
conclusion can be reached that urban form can be explored as fractals within
certain ranges of scales and fractal geometry can be applied to the spatial
analysis of the scale-free aspects of urban morphology.

inherent bias, most notably position bias, has prevented it from being used in
training of a ranker for search, i.e., learning-to-rank. Recently, a number of
authors have proposed new techniques referred to as 'unbiased
learning-to-rank', which can reduce position bias and train a relatively
high-performance ranker using click data. Most of the algorithms, based on the
inverse propensity weighting (IPW) principle, first estimate the click bias at
each position, and then train an unbiased ranker with the estimated biases
using a learning-to-rank algorithm. However, there has not been a method for
pairwise learning-to-rank that can jointly conduct debiasing of click data and
training of a ranker using a pairwise loss function. In this paper, we propose
a novel algorithm, which can jointly estimate the biases at click positions and
the biases at unclick positions, and learn an unbiased ranker. Experiments on
benchmark data show that our algorithm can significantly outperform existing
algorithms. In addition, an online A/B Testing at a commercial search engine
shows that our algorithm can effectively conduct debiasing of click data and
enhance relevance ranking.

has surpassed human ability in some visual recognition tasks such as detection
of traffic signs, faces and handwritten numbers. On the other hand, even
state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods have difficulties in
environments with sparse and binary rewards. They requires manually shaping
reward functions, which might be challenging to come up with. These tasks,
however, are trivial to human. One of the reasons that human are better
learners in these tasks is that we are embedded with much prior knowledge of
the world. These knowledge might be either embedded in our genes or learned
from imitation - a type of supervised learning. For that reason, the best way
to narrow the gap between machine and human learning ability should be to mimic
how we learn so well in various tasks by a combination of RL and supervised
learning. Our method, which integrates Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients and
Hindsight Experience Replay (RL method specifically dealing with sparse
rewards) with an experience ranking CNN, provides a significant speedup over
the learning curve on simulated robotics tasks. Experience ranking allows
high-reward transitions to be replayed more frequently, and therefore help
learn more efficiently. Our proposed approach can also speed up learning in any
other tasks that provide additional information for experience ranking.

domain which leverages data from both source and target domain. One promising
idea is to minimize the feature distribution differences of the two domains.
Most existing studies explicitly minimize such differences by an exact
alignment mechanism (aligning features by one-to-one feature alignment,
projection matrix etc.). Such exact alignment, however, will restrict models'
learning ability and will further impair models' performance on classification
tasks when the semantic distributions of different domains are very different.
To address this problem, we propose a novel group alignment which aligns the
semantics at group level. In addition, to help the model learn better semantic
groups and semantics within these groups, we also propose a partial supervision
for model's learning in source domain. To this end, we embed the group
alignment and a partial supervision into a cross-domain topic model, and
propose a Cross-Domain Labeled LDA (CDL-LDA). On the standard 20Newsgroup and

qualitative (topic detection) experiments are conducted to show the

recommendation since the visual appearance of clothing products has a
significant impact on consumers' decision. Most existing methods rely on
conventional features to represent an image, such as the visual features
extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNN features) and the
scale-invariant feature transform algorithm (SIFT features), color histograms,
and so on. Nevertheless, one important type of features, the \emph{aesthetic
features}, is seldom considered. It plays a vital role in clothing
recommendation since a users' decision depends largely on whether the clothing
is in line with her aesthetics, however the conventional image features cannot
portray this directly. To bridge this gap, we propose to introduce the
aesthetic information, which is highly relevant with user preference, into
clothing recommender systems. To achieve this, we first present the aesthetic
features extracted by a pre-trained neural network, which is a brain-inspired
deep structure trained for the aesthetic assessment task. Considering that the
aesthetic preference varies significantly from user to user and by time, we
then propose a new tensor factorization model to incorporate the aesthetic

reconstruction to sense multiple non-contiguous frequency bands. Since the
throughput (i.e. the number of vacant bands) increases while the probability of
successful reconstruction decreases with increase in the number of sensed
bands, we develop an online learning algorithm to characterize and select
frequency bands based on their spectrum statistics. We guarantee that the
proposed algorithm allows sensing of maximum possible number of frequency bands
and hence, it is referred to as throughput optimized WSS. We also provide a
lower bound on the number of time slots required to characterize spectrum

Later, these shared features are used in different settings (directions) to
segment and classify the abnormal region of the image. Finally, results of the
classification and segmentation directions are fused to obtain the classified
segmentation map. Proposed framework is simulated using four frequent
gastrointestinal abnormalities as well as three dermoscopic lesions and for
evaluation of the proposed framework the results are compared with the

evolution theory. Here we analyze Western classical music data and find
statistical evolutionary laws. For example, distributions of the frequencies of
some rare musical events (e.g. dissonant intervals) exhibit steady increase in
the mean and standard deviation as well as constancy of their ratio. We then
study an evolutionary model where creators learn their data-generation models
from past data and generate new data that will be socially selected by
evaluators according to the content dissimilarity (novelty) and style
conformity (typicality) with respect to the past data. The model reproduces the
observed statistical laws and can make non-trivial predictions for the

different parameterization can predict the evolution of Japanese enka music,

bidisperse dissipative particles under gravity. The cruiser has a circular
shape with a square indentation on its edge. By shifting and then ejecting
granular particles entering its indent-region facing a given direction, the
cruiser gains thrust to push itself forward in the same direction, which can be
either perpendicular or parallel to gravity. Using molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations, we identify three universal phases during one particle-ejection
process: 1) acceleration by the ejection thrust, 2) deceleration by the
compressed particles ahead and 3) relaxation with the decompressed particles.
We also confirm that the cruising capability improves with increasing the
particle-ejection strength and with decreasing the interference from gravity.

it may reduce users' awareness of physical surroundings and cause safety

information design to increase users' situational awareness (SA) of physical

there is a tradeoff between the awareness in reality and the interference with
users' experience in virtuality. In this paper, we design five representations
(indexical, symbolic, and iconic with three emotions) based on two dimensions
(vividness and emotion) to address the problem. We conduct an empirical study
to evaluate participants' SA, perceived breaks in presence (BIPs), and
perceived engagement through VR tasks that require movement in space. Results
show that designs with higher vividness evoke more SA, designs that are more
consistent with the virtual environment can mitigate the BIP issue, and
emotion-evoking designs are more engaging.

influence of these inclusions in the ground can be characterized in different
ways: redistribution of energy within the network with focusing effects for
seismic metamaterials, wave reflection, frequency filtering, reduction of the
amplitude of seismic signal energy, etc. Here we first provide some time-domain
analysis of the flat lens effect in conjunction with some form of external
cloaking of Rayleigh waves and then we experimentally show the effect of a
finite mesh of cylindrical holes on the ellipticity of the surface Rayleigh
waves at the level of the Earth's surface. Orbital diagrams in time domain are
drawn for the surface particle's velocity in vertical (x,z) and horizontal
(x,y) planes. These results enable us to observe that the mesh of holes locally
creates a tilt of the axes of the ellipse and changes the direction of particle
movement. Interestingly, changes of Rayleigh waves ellipticity can be
interpreted as changes of an effective Poisson ratio. However, the proximity of
the source is also important to explain the shape of the ellipses. We analyze
these observations in terms of wave mode conversions inside the mesh and we
propose to broaden the discussion on the complexity of seismic wave phenomena
in structured soils such as soils foundations and on the coupling effects
specific to the soil-structure interaction.

is cycle consistency, which enforces the translated image by GXY to be
translated back to the input image by an inverse mapping GYX. While cycle
consistency requires the simultaneous training of GXY and GY X, recent studies

successfully constrain the solution space, they overlook the special properties

(oscillator potentials) and atoms with Coulomb potentials in one spatial
dimension. Our findings indicate that the dynamic entanglement of atoms exposed
to powerful ultrashort laser pulse can be easily manipulated by introducing an
appropriate phase modulation where the negative chirp enhances the entanglement
while the positive one suppresses it. These findings can be used to explore the
correlation properties of different constituents of complex quantum systems
subjected to appropriately shaped laser radiation.

functional in powers of the external sources. We derive the response functions
parallel to two well-established approximations for the equilibrium
thermodynamics: the mean-field theory and a beyond-mean-field theory taking
into account the mesonic contributions. The response functions based on the
mean-field theory recover the so-called quasiparticle random phase

responses in various channels within the random phase approximation. We show
that the dynamical structure factors in the baryon axial vector and isospin

dissociation of mesons, respectively. Noting that the mesonic contributions are
not taken into account in the random phase approximation, we also derive the

squeezed states that can be used to implement quantum teleportation and quantum
communication. In the optical domain, EPR states are typically generated using
nondegenerate optical amplifiers and at microwave frequencies Josephson
circuits can serve as a nonlinear medium. It is an outstanding goal to
deterministically generate and distribute entangled states with a mechanical

radiation from a parametrically driven 30 micrometer long silicon nanostring

3.40(37) dB below the vacuum level. This mechanical system correlates up to 50
photons/s/Hz giving rise to a quantum discord that is robust with respect to
microwave noise. Such generalized quantum correlations of separable states are
important for quantum enhanced detection and provide direct evidence for the
non-classical nature of the mechanical oscillator without directly measuring
its state. This noninvasive measurement scheme allows to infer information
about otherwise inaccessible objects with potential implications in sensing,
open system dynamics and fundamental tests of quantum gravity. In the near

torque amounts (TOR) x 3 deviations to start control (DEV)) were designed as a
prototype. Eighteen participants participated in evaluating each strategy in a
highway environment provided by a driving simulator. Two-way repeated measure
ANOVA was used to assess the effects of the system. Both the objective measures
(standard deviation of lane position, steering reversal rate, and root mean
square of lateral speed) and subjective measures (pleasure and arousal of
emotion, trust, disturbance, and satisfaction) are analyzed. The experimental
results demonstrate that all dependent measures are significant. As the TOR
increased, SDLP decreased. However, no difference is observed between the 2-Nm
and 3-Nm TOR in terms of trust and satisfaction. The high disturbance and
negative emotion in 3 Nm appear to be the cause. In terms of the DEV, the high
level of the root mean square of the lateral speed is observed at 0.8 m.
Further, negative effects are found in pleasure, trust, and satisfaction. There
is little difference at all dependent measures between 0.0-m and 0.4-m DEV. In

constraint on color-singletness for the finite quark-gluon phase contribution
leads to a change of the temperature dependence of the susceptibilities in
finite volumes. According to the model, the finite-volume effect depends
qualitatively on the value of $\mu_B$.

is unavailable. For example, medical studies sometimes report only aggregate

a time it is desirable, and in fact could be necessary to infer individual
level characteristics from aggregate data. For instance, other researchers who
want to perform more detailed analysis of disease characteristics would require
individual level data. Similar challenges arise in other fields too including
politics, and marketing.
  In this paper, we present an end-to-end pipeline for processing of aggregate
data to derive individual level statistics, and then using the inferred data to
train machine learning models to answer questions of interest. We describe a
novel algorithm for reconstructing fine-grained data from summary statistics.
This step will create multiple candidate datasets which will form the input to
the machine learning models. The advantage of the highly parallel architecture
we propose is that uncertainty in the generated fine-grained data will be
compensated by the use of multiple candidate fine-grained datasets.
Consequently, the answers derived from the machine learning models will be more
valid and usable. We validate our approach using data from a challenging

essential factor that assists autonomous robots achieved perfect navigation.
Various techniques using camera sensors have been proposed by numerous scholars

the effect of shadow and guidance and re-guidance image filtering algorithms
are used to address the effect of rain and/or snow, while dark channel image

effects. The experimental performance of the road detection system with
filtering algorithms was tested qualitatively and quantitatively using the
following evaluation schemes: False Negative Rate (FNR) and False Positive Rate
(FPR). Comparison results of the road detection system with and without
filtering algorithm shows the filtering algorithm's capability to suppress the
effect of environmental noises because better road/non-road classification is
achieved by the road detection system. with filtering algorithm. This

topological principles are computed from the entire brain, however there is a
need to separate and understand the underlying subnetworks which contribute
towards these observed holistic connectomic alterations. One organizational
principle is the rich-club - a core subnetwork of brain regions that are
strongly connected, forming a high-cost, high-capacity backbone that is
critical for effective communication in the network. Investigations primarily
focus on its alterations with disease and age. Here, we present a systematic
analysis of not only the rich-club, but also other subnetworks derived from
this backbone - namely feeder and seeder subnetworks. Our analysis is applied
to structural connectomes in a normal cohort from a large, publicly available
lifespan study. We demonstrate changes in rich-club membership with age
alongside a shift in importance from 'peripheral' seeder to feeder subnetworks.
Our results show a refinement within the rich-club structure (increase in
transitivity and betweenness centrality), as well as increased efficiency in
the feeder subnetwork and decreased measures of network integration and
segregation in the seeder subnetwork. These results demonstrate the different
developmental patterns when analyzing the connectome stratified according to
its rich-club and the potential of utilizing this subnetwork analysis to reveal

towards general visual understanding. Existing methods found the region-level

Nevertheless, such methods usually require laborious object-level annotations
(i.e., object labels and bounding boxes) for effective learning of the
object-level visual features. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient
deep framework to boost multi-label classification by distilling knowledge from
weakly-supervised detection task without bounding box annotations.
Specifically, given the image-level annotations, (1) we first develop a
weakly-supervised detection (WSD) model, and then (2) construct an end-to-end
multi-label image classification framework augmented by a knowledge
distillation module that guides the classification model by the WSD model
according to the class-level predictions for the whole image and the
object-level visual features for object RoIs. The WSD model is the teacher
model and the classification model is the student model. After this cross-task
knowledge distillation, the performance of the classification model is
significantly improved and the efficiency is maintained since the WSD model can
be safely discarded in the test phase. Extensive experiments on two large-scale
datasets (MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE) show that our framework achieves superior
performances over the state-of-the-art methods on both performance and
efficiency.

efficient collaboration in economical, artificial, and biological systems.
Here, we investigate the hypothesis that both features can be explained by the

an information-theoretic approach based on a Free Energy principle, in order to
computationally analyze systems of bounded rational agents that deal with such
limitations optimally. We find that specialization allows to focus on fewer
tasks, thus leading to a more efficient execution, but in turn requires
coordination in hierarchical structures of specialized experts and coordinating

at lower levels that are coordinated by units at higher levels are optimal,
given that each unit's information-processing capability is limited and
conforms to constraints on complexity costs.

times are presented for a continuous-time stochastic process defined as the
mixture of Markov jump processes moving at different speeds on the same finite
state space, while the mixture occurs at a random time. Such mixture was first
proposed by Frydman \cite{Frydman2005} and Frydman and Schuermann
\cite{Frydman2008} as a generalization of the mover-stayer model of Blumen et
at. \cite{Blumen}, and was recently extended by Surya \cite{Surya2018}, in
which explicit distributional identities of the process are given, in
particular in the presence of an absorbing state. We revisit \cite{Surya2018}
for a finite mixture with overlapping absorbing sets. The contribution of this
paper is two fold. First, we generalize distributional properties of the
mixture discussed in \cite{Frydman2008} and \cite{Surya2018}. Secondly, we give
distributional identities of the first exit times explicitly in terms of
intensity matrices of the underlying Markov processes and the Bayesian updates
of switching probability and of the probability distribution of states, despite
the fact that the mixture itself is non-Markov. They form non-stationary
functions of time and have the ability to capture heterogeneity and path
dependence when conditioning on the available information (either full or
partial) of the process. In particular, initial profile of the distributions
forms of a generalized mixture of multivariate phase-type distributions of
Assaf et al. \cite{Assaf1984}. When the underlying processes move at the same
speed, in which case the mixture becomes a simple Markov process, these
features are removed, and the initial distributions reduce to \cite{Assaf1984}.
Some explicit and numerical examples are discussed to illustrate the main
results.

the assessors follow their own criteria to place samples on a tablecloth,
according to the similarity between samples. In order to analyse the data
collected, first a geometric clustering is performed to each tablecloth,
extracting connections between the samples. Then, these connections are used to
construct a global similarity matrix. Finally, a graph drawing algorithm is
used to obtain a 2D consensus graphic, which reflects the global opinion of the
panel by (1) positioning closer those samples that have been globally perceived
as similar and (2) showing the strength of the connections between samples. The
proposal is validated by performing four tasting sessions, with three types of
panels tasting different wines, and by developing a new software to implement
the proposed techniques. The results obtained show that the graphics provide
similar positionings of the samples as the consensus maps obtained by multiple
factor analysis (MFA), further providing extra information about connections
between samples, not present in any previous method. The main conclusion is
that the use of geometric techniques provides information complementary to MFA,
and of a different type. Finally, the method proposed is computationally able
to manage a significantly larger number of assessors than MFA, which can be
useful for the comparison of pictures by a huge number of consumers, via the

networks. In this direction, we have recently introduced Forman's
discretization of Ricci curvature to the realm of undirected networks.
Investigation of this edge-centric network measure, Forman-Ricci curvature, in
diverse model and real-world undirected networks revealed that the curvature
measure captures several aspects of the organization of undirected complex
networks. However, many important real-world networks are inherently directed
in nature, and the definition of the Forman-Ricci curvature for undirected
networks is unsuitable for the analysis of such directed networks. Hence, we
here extend the Forman-Ricci curvature for undirected networks to the case of
directed networks. The simple mathematical formula for the Forman-Ricci
curvature of a directed edge elegantly incorporates vertex weights, edge
weights and edge direction. Furthermore we have compared the Forman-Ricci
curvature with the adaptation to directed networks of another discrete notion
of Ricci curvature, namely, the well established Ollivier-Ricci curvature.
However, the two above-mentioned curvature measures do not account for
higher-order correlations between vertices. To this end, we adjusted Forman's
original definition of Ricci curvature to account for directed simplicial
complexes and also explored the potential of this new, augmented type of
Forman-Ricci curvature, in directed complex networks.

  and Backhaul Issues","2018 IEEE Global Communications Conference: Workshops: 9th
  International Workshop on Wireless Networking and Control for Unmanned
  Autonomous Vehicles",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Drone-based communications is a novel and attractive area of research in
cellular networks. It provides several degrees of freedom in time (available on
demand), space (mobile) and it can be used for multiple purposes (self-healing,
offloading, coverage extension or disaster recovery). This is why the wide
deployment of drone-based communications has the potential to be integrated in
the 5G standard. In this paper, we utilize a grid of drones to provide cellular
coverage to disaster-struck regions where the terrestrial infrastructure is
totally damaged due to earthquake, flood, etc. We propose solutions for the
most challenging issues facing drone networks which are limited battery energy
and limited backhauling. Our proposed solution based mainly on using three
types of drones; tethered backhaul drone (provides high capacity backhauling),
untethered powering drone (provides on the fly battery charging) and untethered
communication drone (provides cellular connectivity). Hence, an optimization
problem is formulated to minimize the energy consumption of drones in addition
to determining the placement of these drones and guaranteeing a minimum rate
for the users. The simulation results show that we can provide unlimited
cellular service to the disaster-affected region under certain conditions with
a guaranteed minimum rate for each user.

attractive not only for basic applications but also for more elaborate
projects, amongst which physics teaching or research. In this article, we show
how temperature-dependent transport measurements can be performed using an
Arduino microcontroller, from cryogenic temperatures up to room temperature or
above. We focus on two of the main issues for this type of experiments: the
determination of the sample temperature and the measurement of its resistance.
We also detail two student-led experiments: evidencing the magnetocaloric
effect in Gadolinium and measuring the resistive transition of a high critical
temperature superconductor.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While the machine learning literature dedicated to fully automated reasoning
algorithms is abundant, the number of methods enabling the inference process on
the basis of previously defined knowledge structures is scanter. Fuzzy
Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are neural networks that can be exploited towards this
goal because of their flexibility to handle external knowledge. However, FCMs
suffer from a number of issues that range from the limited prediction horizon
to the absence of theoretically sound learning algorithms able to produce
accurate predictions. In this paper, we propose a neural network system named
Short-term Cognitive Networks that tackle some of these limitations. In our
model weights are not constricted and may have a causal nature or not. As a
second contribution, we present a nonsynaptic learning algorithm to improve the
network performance without modifying the previously defined weights. Moreover,
we derive a stop condition to prevent the learning algorithm from iterating
without decreasing the simulation error.
