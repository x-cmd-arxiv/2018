lensing power spectrum from CMB power spectra to the Planck satellite data.
This method allows us to analyze the tension between the temperature power
spectrum and lens reconstruction in a model independent way. Even when allowing
for arbitrary variations in the lensing power spectrum, the tension remains at
the 2.4$\sigma$ level. By separating the lensing and unlensed high redshift
information in the CMB power spectra, we also show that under $\Lambda$CDM the
two are in tension at a similar level whereas the unlensed information is
consistent with lensing reconstruction. These anomalies are driven by the
smoother acoustic peaks relative to $\Lambda$CDM at $\ell \sim 1250 - 1500$.
Both tensions relax slightly when polarization data are considered. This
technique also isolates the one aspect of the lensing power spectrum that the
Planck CMB power spectra currently constrain and can be straightforwardly
generalized to future data when CMB power spectra constrain multiple aspects of
lensing which are themselves correlated with lensing reconstruction.

SpiderConv, which extend convolutional operations from regular grids to
irregular point sets that can be embedded in R^n, by parametrizing a family of
convolutional filters. We design the filter as a product of a simple step
function that captures local geodesic information and a Taylor polynomial that
ensures the expressiveness. SpiderCNN inherits the multi-scale hierarchical
architecture from classical CNNs, which allows it to extract semantic deep
features. Experiments on ModelNet40 demonstrate that SpiderCNN achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy 92.4% on standard benchmarks, and shows competitive
performance on segmentation task.

key step toward a better understanding of stellar evolution. Zahn (1974) argued
that thermally diffusive shear-induced turbulence might be responsible for some
of this mixing. In Part I and Part II of this series of papers we showed that
Zahn's (1974, 1992) mixing model applies when the properties of the turbulence
are local. But we also discovered limitations of the model when this locality
condition fails, in particular near the edge of a turbulent region. In this
paper, we propose a second-order closure model for the transport of momentum
and chemical species by shear-induced turbulence in strongly stratified,
thermally diffusive environments (the so-called low P\'eclet number limit),
which builds upon the work of Garaud \& Ogilvie (2005). Comparison against
direct numerical simulations (DNSs) shows that the model is able to predict the
vertical profiles of the mean flow and of the stress tensor (including the
momentum transport) in diffusive shear flows, often with a reasonably good
precision, and at least within a factor of order unity in the worst case
scenario. The model is sufficiently simple to be implemented in stellar
evolution codes, and all the model constants have been calibrated against DNSs.
While significant limitations to its use remain (e.g. it can only be used in
the low P\'eclet number, slowly rotating limit), we argue that it is more
reliable than most of the astrophysical prescriptions that are used in stellar

non-BPS multi-instanton configurations, such as instanton-anti-instanton

show that in this case the semi-classical contribution of the critical point at

associated non-Gaussian QZM-thimble. This approach resolves several puzzles in
the literature concerning the semi-classical contribution of correlated
$[{I}\bar{I}]$ pairs. It has the surprising consequence that the configurations
that dominate the expansion of observables, and the critical points that define
the Lefschetz thimble decomposition need not be the same, a feature not present

Bloch-Messiah theorem, any Gaussian unitary can be decomposed into a passive

interferometer. Here, it is shown how to circumvent the need for active
transformations. Namely, we provide a technique to simulate sampling from the
joint input and output distributions of any Gaussian circuit with passive
interferometry only, provided two-mode squeezed vacuum states are available as
a prior resource. At the heart of the procedure, we exploit the fact that a
beam splitter under partial time reversal simulates a two-mode squeezer, which
gives access to an arbitrary Gaussian circuit without any nonlinear optical

reduction in both laminar and turbulent flows by introducing an apparent slip
velocity along an air-water interface trapped within the surface roughness. In
the experiments presented within this study, we demonstrate the existence of a
surface tension gradient associated with the resultant Marangoni flow along an
air-water interface that causes the slip velocity and slip length to be
significantly reduced. In this study, the slip velocity along a
millimeter-sized air-water interface was investigated experimentally. This
large-scale air-water interface facilitated a detailed investigation of the
interfacial velocity profiles as the flow rate, interfacial curvature and
interface geometry were varied. For the air-water interfaces supported above
continuous grooves (concentric rings within a torsional shear flow) where no
surface tension gradient exists, a slip velocity as high as 30% of the bulk
velocity was observed. However, for the air-water interfaces supported above
discontinuous grooves (rectangular channels in a Poiseuille flow), the presence
of a surface tension gradient reduced the slip velocity and in some cases
resulted in an interfacial velocity that was opposite to the main flow
direction. The curvature of the air-water interface in the spanwise direction
was found to dictate the details of the interfacial flow profile with reverse
flow in the center of the interface for concave surfaces and along the outside
of the interface for convex surfaces. The deflection of the air-water interface
was also found to greatly affect the magnitude of the slip. Numerical
simulations imposed with a relatively small surface tension gradient along the
air-water interface were able to predict both the reduced slip velocity and
back flow along the air-water interface.

capability does not suffer time-binning related issues. The method can be

activations, either directly via an energy minimization scheme or indirectly
through a recurrent model that translates human language queries to interaction
weights. Learning the verbal interaction is fully automatic and does not
require manual text annotations. We evaluate the method on two datasets,
showing that guiding a pre-trained network can improve performance, and provide
extensive insights into the interaction between the guide and the CNN.

suitable catalysts for catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) as they are effective for
deoxygenation and can catalyze certain reactions that typically occur on noble
metals. Oxygen deposited during deoxygenation reactions may alter the carbide
structure leading to the formation of oxycarbides, which can determine changes
in catalytic activity or selectivity. Despite emerging spectroscopic evidence
of bulk oxycarbides, so far there have been no reports of their precise atomic
structure or their relative stability with respect to orthorhombic Mo2C. This
knowledge is essential for assessing the catalytic properties of molybdenum
(oxy)carbides for CFP. In this article, we use density functional theory (DFT)
calculations to (a) describe the thermodynamic stability of surface and
subsurface configurations of oxygen and carbon atoms for a commonly studied
Mo-terminated surface of orthorhombic Mo2C, and (b) determine atomic structures
for oxycarbides with a Mo:C ratio of 2:1. The surface calculations suggest that
oxygen atoms are not stable under the top Mo layer of the Mo2C(100) surface.
Coupling DFT calculations with a polymorph sampling method, we determine
(Mo2C)xOy oxycarbide structures for a wide range of oxygen compositions.
Oxycarbides with lower oxygen content (y/x <=2) adopt layered structures
reminiscent of the parent carbide phase, with flat Mo layers separated by
layers of oxygen and carbon; for higher oxygen content, our results suggest the
formation of amorphous phases, as the atomic layers lose their planarity with
increasing oxygen content.

prevails over a large range of disorder strengths, which is in contrast to spin
transport that is subdiffusive in the same regime for weak disorder strengths.

decay as a function of system size with the same exponent. Based on this, we
conclude that diffusion of energy is much more pervasive than that of
magnetization in these disordered spin-1/2 systems, and occurs across a
significant range of the interaction-disorder parameter phase-space; we suggest
this is due to conservation laws present in the clean XXZ limit.

$\sqrt{1/y_\mu}$, with $y_\mu$ the muon Yukawa coupling, resulting in masses

reservoirs at different temperatures or chemical potentials, it cannot achieve
a global thermal equilibrium and is instead driven to a set of current-carrying
nonequilibrium states. Despite the broad relevance of such a scenario to
metallic systems, there have been limited investigations of the entanglement
structure of the resulting long-time states, in part, due to the fundamental
difficulty in solving realistic models for disordered, interacting electrons.
We investigate this problem by carefully analyzing two ""toy"" models for
coherent quantum transport of diffusive fermions: the celebrated
three-dimensional, noninteracting Anderson model and a class of random quantum
circuits acting on a chain of qubits, which exactly maps to a diffusive,
interacting fermion problem. Crucially, the random circuit model can also be
tuned to have no interactions between the fermions, similar to the Anderson
model. We show that the long-time states of driven noninteracting fermions
exhibit volume-law mutual information and entanglement, both for our random
circuit model and for the nonequilibrium steady-state of the Anderson model.
With interactions, the random circuit model is quantum chaotic and approaches
local equilibrium, with only short-range entanglement. These results provide a
generic picture for the emergence of local equilibrium in current-driven
quantum-chaotic systems, and also provide examples of stable, highly-entangled
many-body states out of equilibrium. We discuss experimental techniques to
probe these effects in low-temperature mesoscopic wires or ultracold atomic
gases.

density. Therefore the evolution of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) hosted by such
stars are subject to the influence of other members of the cluster. Physically,
PPDs might be truncated either by photoevaporation due to ultraviolet flux from
massive stars, or tidal truncation due to close stellar encounters. Here we aim
to compare the two effects in real cluster environments. In this vein we first
review the properties of well studied stellar clusters with a focus on stellar
number density, which largely dictates the degree of tidal truncation, and far
ultraviolet (FUV) flux, which is indicative of the rate of external
photoevaporation. We then review the theoretical PPD truncation radius due to
an arbitrary encounter, additionally taking into account the role of eccentric
encounters that play a role in hot clusters with a 1D velocity dispersion
$\sigma_v > 2$ km/s. Our treatment is then applied statistically to varying
local environments to establish a canonical threshold for the local stellar
density ($n_{c} > 10^4$ pc$^{-3}$) for which encounters can play a significant
role in shaping the distribution of PPD radii over a timescale $\sim 3$ Myr. By
combining theoretical mass loss rates due to FUV flux with viscous spreading in
a PPD we establish a similar threshold for which a massive disc is completely
destroyed by external photoevaporation. Comparing these thresholds in local
clusters we find that if either mechanism has a significant impact on the PPD
population then photoevaporation is always the dominating influence.

modulated by the ionic and water content, which change in presence of

biomarker in oncology. MR-Electrical Properties Tomography (MR-EPT) aims to
reconstruct tissue EPs by solving an electromagnetic inverse problem relating
MR measurements of the transmit radiofrequency RF field to the EPs. However,
MR-EPT reconstructions highly suffer from noise in the RF field maps, which
limits the clinical applicability. Instead of employing electromagnetic models
posing strict requirements on the measured quantities, we propose a data driven
approach where the inverse transformation is learned by means of a neural
network. Supervised training of a conditional generative adversarial neural
network was performed using simulated realistic RF field maps and realistic
human head dielectric models. Deep learning EPT (DL-EPT) reconstructions are
presented for in-silica MR data and MR measurements at 3 Tesla on phantoms and
human brains. DL-EPT shows high quality EP maps, demonstrating good accuracy
and greatly improved precision compared to conventional MR-EPT. Moreover,
DL-EPT allows permittivity reconstructions at 3 Tesla, which is not possible
with state-of-art MR-EPT techniques. The supervised learning-based approach
leverages the strength of tailored electromagnetic simulations, allowing
inclusion of a priori information (e.g. coil setup) and circumvention of
inaccessible MR electromagnetic quantities. Since DL-EPT is highly
noise-robust, the requirements for MRI data acquisitions can be relaxed,
allowing faster acquisitions and higher resolutions. We believe that DL-EPT
greatly improves the quality and applicability of EPT opening a new window for
an endogenous biomarker in MRI diagnostics that reflects differences in ionic
tissue content.

linear decline with a steep slope of 2.5 mag/100 days (i.e., an exponential
decline in flux), through the end of observations at phase ~260 days. In
contrast, the light curves of hydrogen rich supernovae (SNe II-P/L) always show
breaks in their light curves at phase ~100 days, before settling onto Co56
radioactive decay tails with a decline rate of about 1 mag/100 days. The
spectra of ASASSN-15nx do not exhibit the narrow emission-line features
characteristic of Type IIn SNe, which can have a wide variety of light-curve
shapes usually attributed to strong interactions with a dense circumstellar
medium (CSM). ASASSN-15nx has a number of spectroscopic peculiarities,
including a relatively weak and triangularly-shaped H-alpha emission profile
with no absorption component. The physical origin of these peculiarities is
unclear, but the long and linear post-peak light curve without a break suggests
a single dominant powering mechanism. Decay of a large amount of Ni56 (M_Ni56 =
1.6 +/- 0.2 M_sun) can power the light curve of ASASSN-15nx, and the steep
light-curve slope requires substantial gamma-ray escape from the ejecta, which
is possible given a low-mass hydrogen envelope for the progenitor. Another
possibility is strong CSM interactions powering the light curve, but the CSM
needs to be sculpted to produce the unique light-curve shape and to avoid
producing SN IIn-like narrow emission lines.

properties of neutrinos. With current and upcoming precision experiments, it is
essential more than ever to understand the reactor neutrino flux and spectrum.
However, two discrepancies between prediction and measurement are observed. On
the one hand, there is a $\sim6\%$ total measured flux deficit, known as the
reactor antineutrino anomaly, consistently seen by several experiments at short
baselines. On the other hand, there is an observed excess over prediction for
$\bar\nu_e$ energies between 5-7 MeV. We discuss current status of the
experimental measurements and provide an outlook.

estimate line of sight dust extinction to each star, and a five-parameter dust
extinction model was fit, or a one-parameter fit in the case of low extinction.
These spectra dovetail with the similar Next Generation Stellar Library (NGSL)

high signal-to-noise ratio echelle spectra, obtained with the MIKE, FEROS,
SOFIN, UVES, and FIES spectrographs. The presented Li abundances are corrected
for non-LTE effects. Out of the sample of 714 stars we are able to determine Li
abundances for 420 stars and upper limits on the Li abundance for another 121
stars. 18 of the stars with well-determined Li abundances are listed as
exoplanet host stars. Our main finding is that there are no signatures of Li
production in the thick disk, but the Li abundance for stars of the same
effective temperature is independent of metallicity for stars that can be
associated with the Galactic thick disk. Significant Li production is however
seen in the thin disk, with a steady increase towards super-solar
metallicities. At the highest metallicities, however, around [Fe/H]~ +0.3, we
tentatively confirm the recent discovery that the Li abundances level out. We
hence contradict the recent finding in other studies that found that Li is also
produced in the thick disk. This is likely due to the chemically defined
selection criteria those studies used to define their thick disk samples. Age
criteria that we use here, produce a thick disk stellar sample that is much
less contaminated by thin disk stars, and hence more reliable abundance trends.
[ABRIDGED] A conclusion that can be drawn is that no significant Li production,
relative to the primordial abundance, took place during the first few billion
years of the Milky Way, an era coinciding with the formation and evolution of
the thick disk. [ABRIDGED]

allow corrective control policies for HVDC converters and generators to be

many practical engineering systems nowadays since they are open systems and
their operation heavily depends on nontrivial interactions between the systems

control theory to open discrete event systems in a reactive manner. Starting
from a novel input-output automaton model of an open system, we consider
control objectives that characterize the desired input-output behaviors of the
system, based on which a game-theoretic approach is carried out to compute a
reactive supervisor that steers the system to fulfill the specifications

scales with $K$. The median value of $K$ for the ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ galaxies is

approximation, a multiple scale expansion is made. Due to the rapid spatial
variation of the temperature, the ""ensemble"" averaged/ slowly varying part of
the solution is not described by the arithmetic average of the oscillatory
evolution equation. The standard Markovian and continuum approximations are
shown to be invalid. For times of order $N$, where there are $O(N^2)$ excited

reaches a new saturated state with small time oscillations about the
temperature. This saturated state has smaller resonance layers, (corresponding
to magnetic islands) than those that occur in the isolated resonant
perturbation case. Thus the quasilinear response to the resonant interactions
reduces the effective size of the perturbations. The temperature gradient of
the saturated state vanishes at all the excited resonance surfaces but has a
nonzero average. Thus either the quasi-linear approximation ceases to be valid
on long time scales, or the fluid remains essentially in this modified
equilibrium and does not evolve diffusively. Thus collisionless, driftless fast
particles will not be lost rapidly in equilibria with many small islands.

linear time-varying input-output (IO) system model that represents the relation
between the DER active power injections (inputs), and the total active power
exchanged between the distribution and bulk power systems (output); (ii) an
estimator that aims to estimate the IO model parameters, and (iii) a controller

resolve the potential issue of collinearity in the measurements used by the
estimator, we introduce random perturbations in the DER active power injections

experimental constraints is extended by including the Fermi-LAT likelihood for
gamma-ray constraints from dwarf spheroidal galaxies and by providing an
interface with the nested sampling algorithm PyMultinNest to perform high
dimensional parameter scans efficiently. We validate the code for a wide set of

classical pricing rules for day-ahead electricity markets, namely Convex Hull

with non-convex demand bids. These demand bids can, for example, be useful to
large industrial consumers, and extend demand block orders in use by European
Power Exchanges. For this purpose, we show that Convex Hull Prices can be
efficiently computed using continuous relaxations for bidding products
involving start-up costs, minimum power output levels and ramp constraints, or
analogous versions on the demand side. Relying on existing efficient
algorithmic approaches to handle European-like market rules for such bidding
products, we provide comparative numerical experiments using realistic data,
which, together with stylized examples, elucidates the relative merits of each
pricing rule from economic and computational perspectives. The motivation for
this work is the prospective need for mid-term evolution of day-ahead markets
in Europe and in the US, as well as the importance of day-ahead price signals,
since these (spot) prices are used as reference prices for many power

changes, which are commonly assessed in vivo using MRI and PET. Currently, the
most approaches to analyze statistical associations between brain regions rely
on Pearson correlation. However, these are prone to spurious correlations
arising from uninformative shared variance. Notably, there are no appropriate
multivariate statistical models available that can easily integrate dozens of
variables derived from such data, being able to use the additional information
provided from the combination of data sources. Gaussian graphical models (GGMs)
can estimate the conditional dependency from given data, which is expected to
reflect the underlying causal relationships. We applied GGMs to assess
multimodal regional brain alterations in AD. We obtained data from N=972
subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The mean amyloid
load (AV45-PET), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), and gray matter volume (MRI)
were calculated. GGMs were estimated using a Bayesian framework for the
combined multimodal data to obtain conditional dependency networks. Conditional
dependency matrices were much sparser (10% density) than Pearson correlation
matrices (50% density). Within modalities, conditional dependency networks
yielded clusters connecting anatomically adjacent regions. For associations
between different modalities, only few region-specific connections remained.
Graph-theoretical network statistics were significantly altered between groups,
with a biphasic u-shape trajectory. GGMs removed shared variance among
multimodal measures of regional brain alterations in MCI and AD, and yielded
sparser matrices compared to Pearson correlation networks. Therefore, GGMs may
be used as alternative to thresholding-approaches typically applied to
correlation networks to obtain the most informative relations between
variables.

the joint-contact coupling, surface nonlinearities and high dimensionality,

planning methods by optimization, sampling or learning work well in planning
for parallel grippers but remain challenging for multi-fingered hands. This
paper proposes a strategy called finger splitting, to plan precision grasps for
multi-fingered hands starting from optimal parallel grasps. The finger
splitting is optimized by a dual-stage iterative optimization including a
contact point optimization (CPO) and a palm pose optimization (PPO), to
gradually split fingers and adjust both the contact points and the palm pose.
The dual-stage optimization is able to consider both the object grasp quality
and hand manipulability, address the nonlinearities and coupling, and achieve
efficient convergence within one second. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. The simulation video is available at:

interaction when a wavepacket of size (duration) is short relative to the
radiation wavelength, are close to the predictions of the classical
point-particle modeling. On the other hand, in the long-sized wavepacket limit,
the interaction is quantum-mechanical, and it diminishes exponentially at high
frequency. We exemplify these effects through the scheme of Smith-Purcell
radiation, and demonstrate that if the wavepacket is optically-modulated and
periodically-bunched, it exhibits finite radiative emission at harmonics of the
modulation frequency beyond the limit of high-frequency cutoff. Besides, the
radiation analysis is further extended to the cases of superradiant emission
from a beam of phase-correlated modulated electron wavepackets. This
wavepacket-dependent emission process shows the radiative features of
classical-to-quantum transition, indicates a way for measuring the quantum
electron wavepacket size and suggests a new direction for exploring

learning is not yet well understood, and raises a number of questions. For
example, in the context of transfer learning, what is the role of a specific

affected when they are trained using various subsets of the set of all classes

an optimal subset of the set of classes, subject to a budget constraint, that
will more likely generate good features for other tasks. To accomplish this, we
use a submodular set function to model the accuracy achievable on a new task
when the features have been learned on a given subset of classes of the source

submodular function. The maximization can be accomplished using an efficient
greedy algorithm that comes with guarantees on the optimality of the solution.

sneutrino as the lightest supersymmetric particle with a mass in the range
$45$-$100$ GeV. The sneutrinos are pair produced via a virtual $W$, $Z$ or
$\gamma$ in the $s$ channel and, given the large value of the tau Yukawa
coupling, their decays into two dileptons or a dilepton plus missing transverse
energy from neutrinos can be significant. The discussion is carried out in the
$\mu \nu$SSM, where the presence of $R$-parity violating couplings involving
right-handed neutrinos solves the $\mu$ problem and can reproduce the neutrino
data. To probe the tau left sneutrinos we compare the predictions of the $\mu
\nu$SSM with the ATLAS search for long-lived particles using displaced lepton
pairs in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt s= 8$ TeV, allowing us to constrain the
parameter space of the model. We also consider an optimization of the trigger
requirements used in existing displaced-vertex searches by means of a High
Level Trigger that exploits tracker information. This optimization is
generically useful for a light metastable particle decaying into soft charged
leptons. The constraints on the sneutrino turn out to be more stringent. We
finally discuss the prospects for the $13$ TeV LHC searches as well as further
potential optimizations.

all possess equilibrium temperature within 300-500K, have similar size (1-3
R_e), and orbit early M dwarfs and late K dwarfs with effective temperatures
within a few hundred Kelvin of one another. In addition, NASA's Kepler/K2 and
Spitzer missions gathered transit observations of each planet, producing an
uniform transit data set both in wavelength and coarse planetary type. With the
transits measured in Kepler's broad optical bandpass and Spitzer's 4.5 micron
wavelength bandpass, we measure the transmission spectral slope, alpha, for the
entire sample. While this measurement is too uncertain in nearly all cases to
infer the properties of any individual planet, the distribution of alpha among
several dozen similar planets encodes a key trend. We find that the
distribution of alpha is not well-described by a single Gaussian distribution.
Rather, a ratio of the Bayesian evidences between the likeliest 1-component and
2-component Gaussian models favors the latter by a ratio of 100:1. One Gaussian
is centered around an average alpha=-1.3, indicating hazy/cloudy atmospheres or
bare cores with atmosphere evaporated. A smaller but significant second
population (20+\-10% of all) is necessary to model significantly higher alpha
values, which indicate atmospheres with potentially detectable molecular
features. We conclude that the atmospheres of small and temperate planets are
far from uniformly flat, and that a subset are particularly favorable for
follow-up observation from space-based platforms like HST and JWST.

a pair-dense relation algebra and proved that every pair-dense relation algebra
is representable. The notion of a pair below the identity element is readily
definable within the equational framework of relation algebras. The notion of a
triple, a quadruple, or more generally, an element of size (or measure) n>2 is
not definable within this framework, and therefore it seems at first glance
that Maddux's theorem cannot be generalized. It turns out, however, that a very
far-reaching generalization of Maddux's result is possible if one is willing to
go outside of the equational framework of relation algebras, and work instead
within the framework of the first-order theory.
  In the present paper, we define the notion of an atom below the identity
element in a relation algebra having measure n for an arbitrary cardinal number
n>0, and we define a relation algebra to be measurable if it's identity element
is the sum of atoms each of which has some (finite or infinite) measure. The
main purpose of the present paper is to construct a large class of new examples
of group relation algebras using systems of groups and corresponding systems of
quotient isomorphisms (instead of the classic example of using a single group
and forming its complex algebra), and to prove that each of these algebras is
an example of a measurable set relation algebra. In a subsequent paper, the
class of examples will be greatly expanded by adding a third ingredient to the
mix, namely systems of ""shifting"" cosets. The expanded class of
examples---called coset relation algebras---will be large enough to prove a
representation theorem saying that every atomic, measurable relation algebra is
essentially isomorphic to a coset relation algebra.

the automatic fitting of synthetic stellar spectra. The program uses a database
of 27\,000 {\sc cmfgen} models of stellar atmospheres arranged in a
six-dimensional (6D) space, where each dimension corresponds to one model
parameter. From these models a library of 2\,835\,000 synthetic spectra were
generated covering the ultraviolet, optical, and infrared region of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Using FIT\textit{spec} we adjust the effective
temperature and the surface gravity. From the 6D array we also get the
luminosity, the metallicity, and three parameters for the stellar wind: the
terminal velocity ($v_\infty$), the $\beta$ exponent of the velocity law, and
the clumping filling factor ($F_{\rm cl}$). Finally, the projected rotational
velocity ($v\cdot\sin i$) can be obtained from the library of stellar spectra.
Validation of the algorithm was performed by analyzing the spectra of a sample
of eight O-type stars taken from the {\sc iacob} spectroscopic survey of
Northern Galactic OB stars. The spectral lines used for the adjustment of the
analyzed stars are reproduced with good accuracy. In particular, the effective
temperatures calculated with the FIT\textit{spec} are in good agreement with
those derived from spectral type and other calibrations for the same stars. The
stellar luminosities and projected rotational velocities are also in good
agreement with previous quantitative spectroscopic analyses in the literature.
An important advantage of FIT\textit{spec} over traditional codes is that the
time required for spectral analyses is reduced from months to a few hours.

three neural network branches: 1) PointNet with 3D points, exploiting the 3D

the local spatial reasoning; and 3) CNN with RGB images, utilizing the full

to exploit the best of all the architectures. We have created a benchmark for
floorplan reconstruction by acquiring RGBD video streams for 155 residential

that exceed the electron thermal velocities. Bulk Comptonization by the
turbulence may therefore dominate over thermal Comptonization in determining
the emergent spectrum. We discuss how to self-consistently resolve and
interpret this effect in calculations of spectra of radiation MHD simulations.
In particular, we show that this effect is dominated by radiation viscous
dissipation and can be treated as thermal Comptonization with an equivalent
temperature. We investigate whether bulk Comptonization may provide a physical
basis for warm Comptonization models of the soft X-ray excess in AGN. We
characterize our results with temperatures and optical depths to make contact
with other models of this component. We show that bulk Comptonization shifts
the Wien tail to higher energy and lowers the gas temperature, broadening the
spectrum. More generally, we model the dependence of this effect on a wide
range of fundamental accretion disc parameters, such as mass, luminosity,
radius, spin, inner boundary condition, and alpha. Because our model connects
bulk Comptonization to one dimensional vertical structure temperature profiles
in a physically intuitive way, it will be useful for understanding this effect
in future simulations run in new regimes. We also develop a global Monte Carlo
code to study this effect in global radiation MHD simulations. This code can be
used more broadly to compare global simulations with observed systems, and in
particular to investigate whether magnetically dominated discs can explain why
observed high Eddington accretion discs appear to be thermally stable.

training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, labeling large-scale
data can be very costly and error-prone, and even high-quality datasets are
likely to contain noisy (incorrect) labels. Existing works usually employ a
closed-set assumption, whereby the samples associated with noisy labels possess
a true class contained within the set of known classes in the training data.
However, such an assumption is too restrictive for many applications, since
samples associated with noisy labels might in fact possess a true class that is
not present in the training data. We refer to this more complex scenario as the
\textbf{open-set noisy label} problem and show that it is nontrivial in order
to make accurate predictions. To address this problem, we propose a novel
iterative learning framework for training CNNs on datasets with open-set noisy
labels. Our approach detects noisy labels and learns deep discriminative
features in an iterative fashion. To benefit from the noisy label detection, we
design a Siamese network to encourage clean labels and noisy labels to be
dissimilar. A reweighting module is also applied to simultaneously emphasize
the learning from clean labels and reduce the effect caused by noisy labels.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet and real-world noisy (web-search) datasets
demonstrate that our proposed model can robustly train CNNs in the presence of
a high proportion of open-set as well as closed-set noisy labels.

150 GPa based on first-principles swarm structure searches. The phase diagrams
of the experimentally known stoichiometries like U2N3 and UN2 are refined. At
zero temperature and pressure, the experimentally observed CaF2-type UN2 is

of interest is not directly observed but is known relative to periodic
examination times; i.e., practitioners observe either current status or
interval-censored data. The analysis of data of this structure is often fraught
with many difficulties. Further exacerbating this issue, in some such studies
the observed data also consists of instantaneous failures; i.e., the event

mixture model, under the PH assumptions, which can be used to analyze
interval-censored data subject to instantaneous failures. To allow for modeling
flexibility, two methods of estimating the unknown cumulative baseline hazard

are considered. Through a novel data augmentation procedure involving latent

this task, namely, (1) how to utilize both past and future contexts for
accurate event proposal predictions, and (2) how to construct informative input
to the decoder for generating natural event descriptions. First, previous works
predominantly generate temporal event proposals in the forward direction, which
neglects future video context. We propose a bidirectional proposal method that
effectively exploits both past and future contexts to make proposal
predictions. Second, different events ending at (nearly) the same time are
indistinguishable in the previous works, resulting in the same captions. We
solve this problem by representing each event with an attentive fusion of
hidden states from the proposal module and video contents (e.g., C3D features).
We further propose a novel context gating mechanism to balance the
contributions from the current event and its surrounding contexts dynamically.
We empirically show that our attentively fused event representation is superior
to the proposal hidden states or video contents alone. By coupling proposal and
captioning modules into one unified framework, our model outperforms the

adversarial attention module progressively discovers salient regions of one
word by densely combining regions of child word nodes in an adversarial manner.
Then residual composition module merges the hidden representations of an
arbitrary number of children through sum pooling and residual connection. Our
ACMN is thus capable of building an interpretable VQA system that gradually
dives the image cues following a question-driven reasoning route and makes
global reasoning by incorporating the learned knowledge of all attention

are nearly identical for tops and stops, while the rate for stop pair

from this stealth region have left behind a ""splinter"" of open parameter space
when $m(\tilde{t}) \simeq m_t$. Removing this splinter requires surgical
precision: the ATLAS constraint on stop pair production reinterpreted here
treats the signal as a contaminant to the measurement of the top pair
production cross section using data from $\sqrt{s} = 7 \text{ TeV}$ and $8
\text{ TeV}$ in a correlated way to control for some systematic errors. ATLAS
fixed $m(\tilde{t}) \simeq m_t$ and $m(\tilde{\chi})= 1 \text{ GeV}$, implying
that a careful recasting of these results into the full $m(\tilde{t}) -
m(\tilde{\chi})$ plane is warranted. We find that the parameter space with

(MLML), which aims to label each test instance with multiple class labels given
training instances that have an incomplete/partial set of these labels. The key
point to handle missing labels is propagating the label information from
provided labels to missing labels, through a dependency graph that each label
of each instance is treated as a node. We build this graph by utilizing
different types of label dependencies. Specifically, the instance-level
similarity is served as undirected edges to connect the label nodes across
different instances and the semantic label hierarchy is used as directed edges
to connect different classes. This base graph is referred to as the mixed
dependency graph, as it includes both undirected and directed edges.
Furthermore, we present another two types of label dependencies to connect the
label nodes across different classes. One is the class co-occurrence, which is
also encoded as undirected edges. Combining with the base graph, we obtain a
new mixed graph, called MG-CO (mixed graph with co-occurrence). The other is
the sparse and low rank decomposition of the whole label matrix, to embed
high-order dependencies over all labels. Combining with the base graph, the new
mixed graph is called as MG-SL (mixed graph with sparse and low rank
decomposition). Based on MG-CO and MG-SL, we propose two convex transductive
formulations of the MLML problem, denoted as MLMG-CO and MLMG-SL, respectively.
Two important applications, including image annotation and tag based image
retrieval, can be jointly handled using our proposed methods. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show that our methods give significant improvements in
performance and robustness to missing labels over the state-of-the-art methods.

One plots effectiveness (a measure of the extent to which the style was
transferred) against coherence (a measure of the extent to which the
transferred image decomposes into objects in the same way that the content

  We construct EC plots comparing a number of recent style transfer methods.
Most methods control within-layer gram matrices, but we also investigate a
method that controls cross-layer gram matrices. These EC plots reveal a number
of intriguing properties of recent style transfer methods. The style used has a
strong effect on the outcome, for all methods. Using large style weights does
not necessarily improve effectiveness, and can produce worse results.
Cross-layer gram matrices easily beat all other methods, but some styles remain
difficult for all methods. Ensemble methods show real promise. It is likely
that, for current methods, each style requires a different choice of weights to
obtain the best results, so that automated weight setting methods are
desirable. Finally, we show evidence comparing our EC evaluations to human

injected, the number of stored particles does not follow a single exponential
decay law as would be expected for stored particles lost solely due to electron
detachment in collision with the residual-gas. Instead, we observe a faster
initial decay rate, which we ascribe to the effect of the space charge of the
ion beam on the storage capacity. %The latter effect becomes insignificant
after longer storage times of typically 100-150 seconds and we then observe a
constant decay rate due to residual-gas collisions.

However, the non-locality of the transformation implies that a periodic chain

fermions. Since only the $N-1$ bond is different, the effect is negligible for
large systems, while it is significant for small systems. In this paper, it is
interesting to find that a class of periodic spin chains can be exactly mapped
to a periodic chain and an anti-periodic chain of lattice fermions without

systems, possible high degeneracy is found to appear in not only the ground

in diffusive wurtzite semiconductor nanowires and their impact on the quantum
correction to the conductivity. Although the lifetime of the long-lived spin
states is limited by the dominant $k$-linear spin-orbit contributions in the
bulk, these terms show almost no effect in the finite-size nanowires. Here, the
spin lifetime is essentially determined by the small $k$-cubic spin-orbit terms
and nearly independent of the wire radius. At the same time, these states
possess in general a complex helical structure in real space that is modulated
by the spin precession length induced by the $k$-linear terms. For this reason,
the experimentally detected spin relaxation largely depends on the ratio
between the nanowire radius and the spin precession length as well as the type
of measurement. In particular, it is shown that while a variation of the radius
hardly affects the magnetoconductance correction, which is governed by the
long-lived spin states, the change in the spin lifetime observed in optical

  complex temporal dynamics of spiking data",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The combination of new recording techniques in neuroscience and powerful
inference methods recently held the promise to recover useful effective models,
at the single neuron or network level, directly from observed data. The value
of a model of course should critically depend on its ability to reproduce the
dynamical behavior of the modeled system; however, few attempts have been made
to inquire into the dynamics of inferred models in neuroscience, and none, to
our knowledge, at the network level. Here we introduce a principled
modification of a widely used generalized linear model (GLM), and learn its
structural and dynamic parameters from ex-vivo spiking data. We show that the
new model is able to capture the most prominent features of the highly
non-stationary and non-linear dynamics displayed by the biological network,
where the reference GLM largely fails. Two ingredients turn out to be key for
success. The first one is a bounded transfer function that makes the single
neuron able to respond to its input in a saturating fashion; beyond its
biological plausibility such property, by limiting the capacity of the neuron
to transfer information, makes the coding more robust in the face of the highly
variable network activity, and noise. The second ingredient is a super-Poisson
spikes generative probabilistic mechanism; this feature, that accounts for the
fact that observations largely undersample the network, allows the model neuron
to more flexibly incorporate the observed activity fluctuations. Taken
together, the two ingredients, without increasing complexity, allow the model
to capture the key dynamic elements. When left free to generate its spontaneous
activity, the inferred model proved able to reproduce not only the
non-stationary population dynamics of the network, but also part of the
fine-grained structure of the dynamics at the single neuron level.

allowing sample averaging, the construction of regression-based models, and
multiple restart strategies together with an auto-detection mechanism. Our

eigenstate distributions along with their inverse participation ratios (IPRs)
for finite chains, where topologically protected edge states are unambiguously

symmetry-breaking disorders. For transverse eigenstates, we further discover
the increase of localization length of topological edge states with the
increase of lattice period due to the presence of strong far-field
dipole-dipole interactions. Moreover, the ultra-strong scattering cross section
and ultra-narrow linewidth of a single cold atom allow us to observe in more
detail about topological states than in conventional systems, such as the

tunable bandgap. We envisage these topological photonic states can provide an

researchers to minimize the side-effects of network reconfiguration. In this
way, the most challenging issue is the number of rerouted flows that affect the
network stability and QoS parameters. As a result, dynamic reconfiguration of
the network with minimum overhead (i.e. minimum flow rerouting) is an
interesting problem in SDN-based resource reallocation. In this paper, we
mathematically formulated the resource reallocation problem as an optimization
problem with minimum network reconfiguration overhead subject to QoS

of solving the optimization problem, a forwarding table compression technique
is devised making the proposed scheme an efficient resource reallocation method

the reconfiguration overhead of the proposed scheme is low, the controller can
reallocate the resources more frequently based on the network condition. We

efficient quantum technique to deal with many matrix operations (such as matrix
multiplication, powers and inversion). It inspires many applications in quantum
machine learning \cite{biamonte, dunjko}. However, due to the restrictions of
HHL algorithm itself, many quantum machine learning algorithms also share one
or two restrictions. The most common restrictions include quantum state
preparation, condition number and Hamiltonian simulation. In this work, we
first give an efficient quantum algorithm to achieve quantum state preparation,
which actually achieves an exponential speedup than the algorithms given in
\cite{clader,lloyd13}. Then we provide an application of HHL algorithm in cubic
spline interpolation problem. We will show that in this problem, the condition
number is small, the preparation of quantum state is efficient based on the new
algorithm we proposed and the Hamiltonian simulation is efficiently
implemented. So the quantum algorithm obtained by HHL algorithm towards this
problem actually achieves an exponential speedup than any classical algorithm
with no restrictions. This can be viewed as another application of HHL
algorithm with no restrictions after the work of Clader et al \cite{clader} in
studying electromagnetic scattering cross-section.

distribution (SED) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This includes an outer
standard disc, an inner warm Comptonising region to produce the soft X-ray
excess and a hot corona. We tie these together energetically by assuming
Novikov-Thorne emissivity, and use this to define a size scale for the hard
X-ray corona as equal to the radius where the remaining accretion energy down
to the black hole can power the observed X-ray emission. We test this on three
AGN with well defined SEDs as well as on larger samples to show that the
average hard X-ray luminosity is always approximately a few percent of the
Eddington luminosity across a large range of Eddington ratio. As a consequence,
the radial size scale required for gravity to power the X-ray corona has to
decrease with increasing Eddington fraction. For the first time we hardwire
this into the spectral models, and set the hard X-ray spectral index self
consistently from the ratio of the hard X-ray luminosity to intercepted seed
photon luminosity from the disc. This matches the observed correlation of
steeper spectral index with increasing Eddington ratio, as well as reproducing
the observed tight UV/X relation of quasars. We also include the reprocessed
emission produced by the hot inner flow illuminating the warm Comptonisation
and standard disc regions and show that this predicts a decreasing amount of
optical variability with increasing Eddington ratio as observed, though
additional processes may also be required to explain the observed optical
variability.

tools for SHM normally require a limited number of physically attached
transducers (e.g. accelerometers) in order to record the response of the
structure for further analysis. Signal conditioners, wires, wireless receivers
and a data acquisition system (DAQ) are also typical components of traditional
sensing systems used in vibration-based SHM. However, instrumentation of
lightweight structures with contact sensors such as accelerometers may induce
mass-loading effects, and for large-scale structures, the instrumentation is
labor intensive and time consuming. Achieving high spatial measurement
resolution for a large-scale structure is not always feasible while working
with traditional contact sensors, and there is also the potential for a lack of
reliability associated with fixed contact sensors in outliving the life-span of
the host structure. Among the state-of-the-art non-contact measurements,
digital video cameras are able to rapidly collect high-density spatial
information from structures remotely. In this paper, the subtle motions from
recorded video (i.e. a sequence of images) are extracted by means of
Phase-based Motion Estimation (PME) and the extracted information is used to
conduct damage identification on a 2.3-meter long Skystream wind turbine blade
(WTB). The PME and phased-based motion magnification approach estimates the
structural motion from the captured sequence of images for both a baseline and
damaged test cases on a wind turbine blade.

\begin{eqnarray*} \partial_t u = \Delta u + u^p, u \in \mathbb{C}
\end{eqnarray*} in $\mathbb{R}^n,$ with an arbitrary power $p,$ $ p > 1$. In
particular, $p$ can be non integer and even irrational. We construct for this
equation a complex solution $u = u_1 + i u_2$, which blows up in finite time
$T$ and only at one blowup point $a.$ Moreover, we also describe the
asymptotics of the solution by the following final profiles: \begin{eqnarray*}
u(x,T) &\sim & \left[ \frac{(p-1)^2 |x-a|^2}{ 8 p
|\ln|x-a||}\right]^{-\frac{1}{p-1}},\\ u_2(x,T) &\sim & \frac{2 p}{(p-1)^2}

  In addition to that, since we also have $u_1 (0,t) \to + \infty$ and
$u_2(0,t) \to - \infty$ as $t \to T,$ the blowup in the imaginary part shows a
new phenomenon unkown for the standard heat equation in the real case: a non
constant sign near the singularity, with the existence of a vanishing surface
for the imaginary part, shrinking to the origin. In our work, we have succeeded
to extend for any power $p$ where the non linear term $u^p$ is not continuous
if $ p$ is not integer. In particular, the solution which we have constructed
has a positive real part. We study our equation as a system of the real part
and the imaginary part $u_1$ and $u_2$. Our work relies on two main arguments:
the reduction of the problem to a finite dimensional one and a topological
argument based on the index theory to get the conclusion.

the kinetic and potential energies, the kurtosis, the wave-action spectrum and
the probability density function (PDF) of wave intensity.
  We show that in the case of small soliton density the kinetic and potential
energies, as well as the kurtosis, are very well described by the analytical
relations derived without taking into account soliton interactions. With
increasing soliton density and velocities, soliton interactions enhance, and we
observe increasing deviations from these relations leading to increased
absolute values for all of these three characteristics. The wave-action
spectrum is smooth, decays close to exponentially at large wavenumbers and
widens with increasing soliton density and velocities. The PDF of wave
intensity deviates from the exponential (Rayleigh) PDF drastically for rarefied
soliton gas, transforming much closer to it at densities corresponding to
essential interaction between the solitons. Rogue waves emerging in soliton gas
are multi-soliton collisions, and yet some of them have spatial profiles very
similar to those of the Peregrine solutions of different orders. We present

next-generation extreme-ultraviolet- (EUV) lithography instruments with a
wavelength of \SI{13.5}{\nano\meter} is currently under development. In
principle, this should allow patterning down to a resolution of a few
nanometers in a single exposure. However, there are many technical challenges,
including those due to the very high energy of the photons. Lithography with
metastable atoms has been suggested as a cost-effective, less-complex
alternative to EUV lithography. The great advantage of atom lithography is that
the kinetic energy of an atom is much smaller than that of a photon for a given
wavelength. However, up till now no method has been available for making masks
for atom lithography that can produce arbitrary, high resolution patterns. Here
we present a solution to this problem. First, traditional binary holography is
extended to near-field binary holography, based on Fresnel diffraction. By this
technique, we demonstrate that it is possible to make masks that can generate
arbitrary patterns in a plane in the near field (from the mask) with a
resolution down to the nanometer range using a state of the art metastable
helium source. We compare the flux of this source to that of an established EUV
