systems that identifies, on the level of individual system outputs over time,
which parts of the implementation are determined by the specification, and
which parts are still open. This information is represented in the form of a
labeled transition system, which we call skeleton. Each state of the skeleton
is labeled with a three-valued assignment to the output variables: each output
can be true, false, or open, where true or false means that the value must be
true or false, respectively, and open means that either value is still
possible. We present algorithms for the verification of skeletons and for the
learning-based synthesis of skeletons from specifications in linear-time
temporal logic (LTL). The algorithm returns a skeleton that satisfies the given
LTL specification in time polynomial in the size of the minimal skeleton. Our
new analysis technique can be used to recognize and repair specifications that
underspecify critical situations. The technique thus complements existing
methods for the recognition and repair of overspecifications via the
identification of unrealizable cores.

physics, such as integrable systems, the classical Yang-Baxter equation,
pre-Lie algebras and splitting of operads. In this paper, a deformation theory
of $\mathcal{O}$-operators is established in consistence with the general
principles of deformation theories. On the one hand, $\mathcal{O}$-operators
are shown to be characterized as the Maurer-Cartan elements in a suitable
graded Lie algebra. A given $\mathcal{O}$-operator gives rise to a differential
graded Lie algebra whose Maurer-Cartan elements characterize deformations of
the given $\mathcal{O}$-operator. On the other hand, a Lie algebra with a
representation is identified from an $\mathcal{O}$-operator $T$ such that the
corresponding Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology controls deformations of $T$, thus
can be regarded as an analogue of the Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology for the
$\mathcal{O}$-operator. Thereafter, infinitesimal and formal deformations of
$\mathcal{O}$-operators are studied. In particular, the notion of Nijenhuis
elements is introduced to characterize trivial infinitesimal deformations.
Formal deformations and extendibility of order $n$ deformations of an
$\mathcal{O}$-operator are also characterized in terms of the new cohomology
theory. Applications are given to deformations of Rota-Baxter operators of
weight 0 and skew-symmetric $r$-matrices for the classical Yang-Baxter
equation. For skew-symmetric $r$-matrices, there is an independent
Maurer-Cartan characterization of the deformations as well as an analogue of
the Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology controlling the deformations, which turn out to
be equivalent to the ones obtained as $\mathcal{O}$-operators associated to the
coadjoint representations. Finally, infinitesimal deformations of
skew-symmetric $r$-matrices and their corresponding triangular Lie bialgebras

  The problem motivating this work was the sink-evacuation problem on trees,
i.e., finding a collection of $k$-sinks that minimize the time required by a
confluent dynamic network flow to evacuate all supplies to sinks.
  This paper provides the first polynomial-time algorithm for solving this

function and its traces are approximated in the piecewise polynomial space (of

By employing a numerical flux that is derived from the first-order upwind

fast convergence to the steady-state solution, a diffusion-type equation for

solved by the HDG simultaneously, on the same meshes. The proposed
HDG-synthetic iterative scheme is proved to be accurate and efficient.
Specifically, for flows in the near-continuum regime, numerical simulations
have shown that, to achieve the same level of accuracy, our scheme could be

approach. Groups of particles are represented by the Fourier Lagrangian basis
and evolve, for a single timestep, along an high-order accurate representation
of the local characteristic lines. The time-advancing technique is based on
Taylor developments that can be, in principle, of any order of accuracy, or by
coupling the phase space discretiza- tion with high-order accurate Backward
Differentiation Formulas (BDF) as in the method-of-lines framework. At each
timestep, particle displacements are reinterpolated and expressed in the
original basis to guarantee the order of accuracy in all the variables at
relatively low costs. Thus, these techniques combine excellent features of
spectral approximations with high-order time integration. Series of numerical
experiments are performed in order to assess the real performance. In
particular, comparisons with standard benchmarks are examined.

using a single RF chain. The degrees of freedom provided by the reconfigurable

Further, to suppress high path loss and shadowing at mmWave frequencies, we use
a rate-one space-time block code. Our analysis and simulations show that the

Experimental ME coefficients and voltages were compared to analytical

two magnetic discs that interact together in parallel magnetic structures were
derived from an analytical calculation based on a superposition method. These
factors were introduced in ME voltage calculations which take account of the
demagnetizing effect. To fit the experimental results, a mechanical coupling
factor was also introduced in the theoretical formula. This reflects the
differential strain that exists in the ferrite and PZT layers due to shear
effects near the edge of the ME samples and within the bonding epoxy layers.
From this study, an optimization in magnitude of the ME voltage is obtained.
Lastly, an analytical calculation of demagnetizing effect was conducted for

yields a far simpler optimisation problem than the complete measure change,

some symmetry arguments. We implement both algorithms for two examples coming
from the Kuramoto model from statistical physics and show that the variance of
the importance sampling schemes is up to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than
that of the standard Monte Carlo. The computational cost is approximately the

  Parameterization","main text 13 pages, 22 pages including reference and appendix",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vanishing and exploding gradients are two of the main obstacles in training
deep neural networks, especially in capturing long range dependencies in
recurrent neural networks~(RNNs). In this paper, we present an efficient
parametrization of the transition matrix of an RNN that allows us to stabilize
the gradients that arise in its training. Specifically, we parameterize the
transition matrix by its singular value decomposition(SVD), which allows us to
explicitly track and control its singular values. We attain efficiency by using
tools that are common in numerical linear algebra, namely Householder
reflectors for representing the orthogonal matrices that arise in the SVD. By
explicitly controlling the singular values, our proposed Spectral-RNN method
allows us to easily solve the exploding gradient problem and we observe that it
empirically solves the vanishing gradient issue to a large extent. We note that
the SVD parameterization can be used for any rectangular weight matrix, hence
it can be easily extended to any deep neural network, such as a multi-layer
perceptron. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our parameterization does not
lose any expressive power, and show how it controls generalization of RNN for
the classification task. %, and show how it potentially makes the optimization
process easier. Our extensive experimental results also demonstrate that the
proposed framework converges faster, and has good generalization, especially in
capturing long range dependencies, as shown on the synthetic addition and copy
tasks, as well as on MNIST and Penn Tree Bank data sets.

a set of linear constraints on the unknown inner mass-points of the toric

and transition to turbulence are still poorly understood. Even in the simple
case of pipe flow subject to harmonic pulsation, there is no consensus among
experimental studies on whether pulsation delays or enhances transition. We
here report direct numerical simulations of pulsatile pipe flow at low
pulsation amplitude A<0.4. We use a spatially localized impulsive disturbance
to generate a single turbulent puff and track its dynamics as it travels
downstream. The computed relaminarization statistics are in quantitative
agreement with the experiments of Xu et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 831, 2017,

and lowering the frequency enhance the stability of the flow. In the
high-frequency regime, the behaviour of steady pipe flow is recovered. In
addition, we show that when the pipe length does not permit the observation of
a full cycle, a reduction of the transition threshold is observed. We obtain an
equation quantifying this effect and compare it favourably with the
measurements of Stettler & Hussain (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 170, 1986, pp.

new results were combined with available data at longer wavelengths and the
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were reconstructed for 177 UCHIIs. The

the radio flux densities to previous observational epochs, we find about 5% of

those used for the law of large number analysis, namely in the proof of
convergence to the hydrodynamic limit (cf. Guo, Papanicolaou and Varadhan
(1988)). Specifically, the key step in the proof is establishing suitable
bounds on relative entropies and Dirichlet forms associated with certain
controlled laws. This general approach has the promise to be applicable to
other interacting particle systems as well and to the case of non-equilibrium
starting configurations, and to infinite volume systems.

developed and implemented KiNetX to possess three features. First, KiNetX
evaluates the kinetic relevance of every species in a (yet incomplete) reaction
network to confine the search for new elementary reaction steps only to those
species that are considered possibly relevant. Second, KiNetX identifies and
eliminates all kinetically irrelevant species and elementary reactions to
reduce a complex network graph to a comprehensible mechanism. Third, KiNetX
estimates the sensitivity of species concentrations toward changes in
individual rate constants (derived from relative free energies), which allows
us to systematically select the most efficient electronic structure model for
each elementary reaction given a predefined accuracy. The novelty of KiNetX
consists in the rigorous propagation of correlated free-energy uncertainty
through all steps of our kinetic analyis. To examine the performance of KiNetX,
we developed AutoNetGen. It semirandomly generates chemistry-mimicking reaction
networks by encoding chemical logic into their underlying graph structure.
AutoNetGen allows us to consider a vast number of distinct chemistry-like
scenarios and, hence, to discuss assess the importance of rigorous uncertainty
propagation in a statistical context. Our results reveal that KiNetX reliably
supports the deduction of product ratios, dominant reaction pathways, and
possibly other network properties from semi-accurate electronic structure data.

secondary CR particles (protons and heavier nuclei, electrons, positrons, and

the nature of the dominant loss process, modelled as continuous or

secondary electrons below $\approx 130$ g cm$^{-2}$ and by electron/positron
pairs created by photon decay above $\approx600$ g cm$^{-2}$. We show that a
proper description of the particle transport is essential to compute the

online settings---is a fundamental task in machine learning and statistics,
with direct connections to classification and boosting. Existing ""fast rates""
for this setting exhibit exponential dependence on the predictor norm, and
Hazan et al. (2014) showed that this is unfortunately unimprovable. Starting
with the simple observation that the logistic loss is $1$-mixable, we design a
new efficient improper learning algorithm for online logistic regression that
circumvents the aforementioned lower bound with a regret bound exhibiting a
doubly-exponential improvement in dependence on the predictor norm. This
provides a positive resolution to a variant of the COLT 2012 open problem of
McMahan and Streeter (2012) when improper learning is allowed. This improvement
is obtained both in the online setting and, with some extra work, in the batch
statistical setting with high probability. We also show that the improved
dependence on predictor norm is near-optimal.
  Leveraging this improved dependency on the predictor norm yields the
following applications: (a) we give algorithms for online bandit multiclass
learning with the logistic loss with an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ relative mistake
bound across essentially all parameter ranges, thus providing a solution to the

deteriorates gracefully as we move from fully stochastic to fully adversarial

  In our model, the rewards for all arms are initially drawn from a

algorithm whose performance gracefully degrades with the total corruption the
adversary injected in the data, measured by the sum across rounds of the
biggest alteration the adversary made in the data in that round; this total
corruption is denoted by $C$. Our algorithm provides a guarantee that retains
the optimal guarantee (up to a logarithmic term) if the input is stochastic and
whose performance degrades linearly to the amount of corruption $C$, while
crucially being agnostic to it. We also provide a lower bound showing that this
linear degradation is necessary if the algorithm achieves optimal performance

near-field plasmonic mode to nanoscale distances, potentially enabling strong

the emitters to the plasmonic mode of the structures, which is particularly
difficult to achieve in a site-controlled structure. We present a technique to
generate quantum emitters in 2D tungsten diselenide (WSe2) coupled to
site-controlled plasmonic nano-pillars. The plasmonic nano-pillars induce
strain in the two dimensional material which generates quantum emitters near

Interactions between the emitter and plasmonic mode result in an enhanced
spontaneous emission and increased brightness. This approach may enable bright

the introduction of a novel variable transformation called PI consensus error
transformation. %that allows for decoupled consensus control design of
multi-agent systems. The new variables include the position error of each agent
from some arbitrary fixed point along with an integral term of the weighted
total displacement of the agent's position from all neighbor positions. It is
proven that if these new variables are bounded and regulated to zero, then
asymptotic consensus among all agents is ensured. The important feature of this
transformation is that it provides input decoupling in the dynamics of the new
error variables making the consensus control design a simple and direct task.
Using classical Nussbaum gain based techniques, distributed controllers are
designed to regulate the PI consensus error variables to zero and ultimately
solve the agreement problem. The proposed approach also allows for a specific
calculation of the final consensus point based on the controller parameter
selection and the associated graph topology. Simulation results verify our

positive or a negative opinion orientation, and can have two levels of
intensity --moderate and extremist. When two interacting agents have the same
orientation become extremists with persuasion probability $p$, while if they
have opposite orientations become moderate with compromise probability $q$.
These updating rules lead to the formation of same-opinion domains with a
coarsening dynamics that depends on the ratio $r=p/q$. The population initially
evolves to a centralized state for small $r$, where domains are composed by
moderate agents and coarsening is without surface tension, and to a
bi-polarized state for large $r$, where domains are formed by extremist agents
and coarsening is driven by curvature. Consensus in an extreme opinion is
finally reached in a time that scales with the population size $N$ and $r$ as
$\tau \simeq r^{-1} \ln N$ for small $r$ and as $\tau \sim r^2 N^{1.64}$ for
large $r$. Bi-polarization could be quite stable when the system falls into a
striped state where agents organize into single-opinion horizontal, vertical or

obtain an approximate expression for $\tau$ which shows that the exponent

wide range of neurological disorders, but data acquisition can be expensive,
time-consuming, and inconvenient. Multi-site studies present a valuable
opportunity to advance research by pooling data in order to increase
sensitivity and statistical power. However images derived from MRI are
susceptible to both obvious and non-obvious differences between sites which can
introduce bias and subject variance, and so reduce statistical power. To
rectify these differences, we propose a data driven approach using a deep
learning architecture known as generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs
learn to estimate two distributions, and can then be used to transform examples
from one distribution into the other distribution. Here we transform
T1-weighted brain images collected from two different sites into MR images from
the same site. We evaluate whether our model can reduce site-specific
differences without loss of information related to gender (male, female) or
clinical diagnosis (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, healthy). When trained
appropriately, our model is able to normalise imaging sets to a common scanner
set with less information loss compared to current approaches. An important
advantage is our method can be treated as a black box that does not require any
knowledge of the sources of bias but only needs at least two distinct imaging
sets.

analyzer developed on the KSTAR tokamak, it is found that several distinct
stages of RF emission appear at the pedestal collapse in high confinement
discharges. Comparison with 2-D electron cyclotron emission (ECE) images has
revealed that each stage is related to the instantaneous condition at the
outboard mid-plane edge. First, high-harmonic ion cyclotron emissions (ICE) are
intensified with the appearance of a non-modal filamentary perturbation in the
edge within several tens of microseconds before the collapse. Then, the RF
emission becomes broad toward high-frequency range (< 500 MHz) at the burst
onset of the non-modal filament. During the pedestal collapse initiated by the
filament burst, rapid chirping (1-3 {\mu}s) appear with additional filament
bursts. The strong correlation between the RF spectra and the perturbation
structure provides important clues on the stability of edge-localized modes and
on the ion dynamics in the plasma boundary.

in the simulation of fluid-solid interaction and particulate flow problems,
since proposed in 2004. However, it is usually a non-trivial task to retain the
flexibility and the accuracy simultaneously in the implementation of this
approach. Based on the intrinsic nature of the LBM, we propose a simple and
second-order accurate IB-LBM in this paper, where the no-slip boundary
condition on the fluid-solid interface is directly imposed by iteratively
correcting the distribution function near the boundary, markedly similar to the
treatment of boundary condition in the original LBM. Therefore, there are no
additional efforts needed to construct an interfacial force model (such as the
spring, feedback and direct force models) and absorb this force into the
framework of LBM. It is worth mentioning that we retain the discrete delta
function for the connection between the Lagrangian and Eulerian meshes, thus
preserving the flexibility of the conventional IB-LBM. Second-order accuracy of
the present IB-LBM is reasonably confirmed in the simulation of cylindrical
Couette flow, while the conventional approach is generally a first-order
scheme. The present method is first validated in the flow past a fixed
cylinder. No streamline penetration is found, indicating the exactly
enforcement of the no-slip boundary condition. Furthermore, in the simulations
of one and two particles settling under gravity, good agreements can be
observed comparing with the data available in the literature.

driving conditions, across seven architectures including a fully-connected
network, a simple 2 layer CNN, AlexNet, VGG-16, Inception-V3, ResNet, and an
LSTM by assessing the number of laps each model was able to successfully
complete without crashing while traversing an indoor racetrack. We compared
performance across models when the conditions exactly matched those in training
as well as when the local environment and track were configured differently and
objects that were not included in the training dataset were placed on the track
in various positions. In addition, we considered performance using several
different data types for training and testing including single grayscale and
color frames, and multiple grayscale frames stacked together in sequence. With
the exception of a fully-connected network, all models performed reasonably
well (around or above 80\%) and most very well (~95\%) on at least one input
type but with considerable variation across models and inputs. Overall,
AlexNet, operating on single color frames as input, achieved the best level of
performance (100\% success rate in phase one and 55\% in phase two) while
VGG-16 performed well most consistently across image types.

Galactic disk stars near the anticenter direction (in the range of
Galactocentric distance between $R=8$ and $13$ kpc and vertical position
between $Z=-2$ and $2$ kpc) exhibit asymmetrical motions in the Galactocentric
radial, azimuthal, and vertical components. Radial motions are not zero, thus
departing from circularity in the orbits; they increase outwards within
$R\lesssim 12$ kpc, show some oscillation in the northern ($0 < Z < 2$ kpc)
stars, and have north-south asymmetry in the region corresponding to a
well-known nearby northern structure in the velocity field. There is a clear
vertical gradient in azimuthal velocity, and also an asymmetry that shifts from
a larger azimuthal velocity above the plane near the solar radius to faster
rotation below the plane at radii of 11-12 kpc. Stars both above and below the
plane at $R\gtrsim 9$ kpc exhibit net upward vertical motions. We discuss some
possible mechanisms that might create the asymmetrical motions, such as
external perturbations due to dwarf galaxy minor mergers or dark matter
sub-halos, warp dynamics, internal processes due to spiral arms or the Galactic
bar, and (most likely) a combination of some or all of these components.

fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk around a protostar early in
the star formation process. As the disk grows in mass, it eventually becomes
gravitationally unstable and fragments, forming one or more new protostars in
orbit with the first at mean separations of 100 astronomical units (AU) or even
less. Here we report direct numerical calculations down to scales as small as
$\sim 0.1$ AU, using a consistent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code,
that show the large-scale fragmentation of a cloud core into two protostars
accompanied by small-scale fragmentation of their circumstellar disks. Our
results demonstrate the two dominant mechanisms of star formation, where the
disk forming around a protostar, which in turn results from the large-scale
fragmentation of the cloud core, undergoes eccentric ($m=1$) fragmentation to
produce a close binary. We generate two-dimensional emission maps and simulated
ALMA 1.3 mm continuum images of the structure and fragmentation of the disks
that can help explain the dynamical processes occurring within collapsing cloud

the direction of the incident field. The modal matching method is used to
determine the scattering coefficients by matrix inversion. Standard cylindrical

exact series expansions for the optical/EM radiation forces assuming either

particularly relevant in optical tweezers and other related applications in

The~rapid development of computer graphics technologies has made it easier to
generate photorealistic computer graphics, and these graphics are quite
difficult to distinguish from natural images (NIs) with the naked eye. In this
paper, we propose a method based on sensor pattern noise (SPN) and deep
learning to distinguish CGs from NIs. Before being fed into our convolutional
neural network (CNN)-based model, these images---CGs and NIs---are clipped into
image patches. Furthermore, three high-pass filters (HPFs) are used to remove
low-frequency signals, which represent the image content. These filters are
also used to reveal the residual signal as well as SPN introduced by the
digital camera device. Different from the traditional methods of distinguishing
CGs from NIs, the proposed method utilizes a five-layer CNN to classify the
input image patches. Based on the classification results of the image patches,
we deploy a majority vote scheme to obtain the classification results for the
full-size images. The~experiments have demonstrated that (1) the proposed
method with three HPFs can achieve better results than that with only one HPF
or no HPF and that (2) the proposed method with three HPFs achieves 100\%
accuracy, although the NIs undergo a JPEG compression with a quality factor of
75.

confinement expressions to plasma profiles and local transport coefficients.
The temperature or diffusivity is parameterized as a function of the normalized
flux radius, $\bar{\psi}$, and the engineering variables, ${\bf u} =
(I_p,B_t,\bar{n},q_{95})^\dagger$. The log-additive temperature model assumes
that $\ln [T(\bar{\psi}, {\bf u})] =$ $f_0 (\bar{\psi}) + f_I
(\bar{\psi})\ln[I_p]$ $+ f_B (\bar{\psi}) \ln [B_t]$ $+ f_n (\bar{\psi}) \ln [
\bar{n}] + f_{q}\ln[q_{95}]$. The unknown $f_i (\bar{\psi})$ are estimated
using smoothing splines. A 43 profile Ohmic data set from the Joint European
Torus is analyzed and its shape dependencies are described. The best fit has an
average error of 152 eV which is 10.5 \% percent of the typical line average
temperature. The average error is less than the estimated measurement error
bars. The second class of models is log-additive diffusivity models where $\ln
[ \chi (\bar{\psi}, {\bf u})] $ $=\ g_0 (\bar{\psi}) + g_I (\bar{\psi})
\ln[I_p]$ $+ g_B (\bar{\psi}) \ln [B_t ]$ $+ g_n (\bar{\psi}) \ln [ \bar{n} ]$.
These log-additive diffusivity models are useful when the diffusivity is varied
smoothly with the plasma parameters. A penalized nonlinear regression technique
is recommended to estimate the $g_i (\bar{\psi})$. The physics implications of
the two classes of models, additive log-temperature models and additive
log-diffusivity models, are different. The additive log-diffusivity models
adjust the temperature profile shape as the radial distribution of sinks and
sources. In contrast, the additive log-temperature model predicts that the
temperature profile depends only on the global parameters and not on the radial
heat deposition.

employed where each file is broken into multiple fragments and each cache
stores multiple coded packets each formed by XORing fragments from different

explicit constructions by the server to meet the arbitrary multi-requests of
all user-groups. Specifically, the stored coded packets of each cache are
classified into four types based on the composition of the file fragments
encoded. A delivery strategy is developed, which separately delivers part of

different packet types in the last stage. The rate as well as the worst rate of

along lines of sight also contribute to the peak signals. In this paper, with
ray tracing simulations, we investigate the LSS projection effects. We show
that for current surveys with a large shape noise, the stochastic LSS effects

redshift $z_{\mathrm{med}}\sim1$ or higher, however, they are significant. For
the cosmological constraints derived from observed WL high peak counts, severe

The first
example is the detection of faint edges in noisy images, a challenging problem
studied in the last decades. A recent study introduced a fast method to detect
faint edges in the highest accuracy among all the existing approaches. Their
complexity is nearly linear in the image's pixels and their runtime is seconds
for a noisy image. Their approach utilizes a multi-scale binary partitioning of
the image. By utilizing the multi-scale U-net architecture, we show in this
paper that their method can be dramatically improved in both aspects of run
time and accuracy. By training the network on a dataset of binary images, we
developed an approach for faint edge detection that works in a linear
complexity. Our runtime of a noisy image is milliseconds on a GPU. Even though
our method is orders of magnitude faster, we still achieve higher accuracy of
detection under many challenging scenarios. In addition, we show that our
approach to performing multi-scale preprocessing of noisy images using U-net
improves the ability to perform other vision tasks under the presence of noise.
We prove it on the problems of noisy objects classification and classical image
denoising. We show that multi-scale denoising can be carried out by a novel

trading period from the opening phase prior to the moment that the stock price
hits its limits. A comparison is made of the properties between up-limit hits
and down-limit hits, and the possible difference will also be compared between
bullish and bearish market state by dividing the whole period into three
alternating bullish periods and three bearish periods. We find that the
cooling-off effect emerges for both up-limit hits and down-limit hits, and the
cooling-off effect of the down-limit hits is stronger than that of the up-limit
hits. The difference of the cooling-off effect between bullish period and
bearish period is quite modest. Moreover, we examine the sub-optimal orders
effect, and infer that the professional individual investors and institutional
investors play a positive role in the cooling-off effects. All these findings
indicate that the price limit trading rule exerts a positive effect on
maintaining the stability of the Chinese stock markets.

tens of nm) to the NV sensing layer. Using magnetic nanoparticles as a test

model in XSPEC. During the entire period of the outburst, a non-thermal
power-law component and the TCAF model fitted sub-Keplerian halo rate were
found to be highly dominant. We suggest that this so-called outburst is due to
enhanced jet activity. Indeed, the `outburst' subsides when this activity
disappears. We estimated X-ray fluxes coming from the base of the jet and found
that the radio flux is correlated with this X-ray flux. Though the object was

In particular, as is the aim of this chapter to show, it may happen that the
relations of fundamentality and emergence between dual theories are inverted.
In other words, the direction of emergence typically found in these cases is
opposite to the direction of emergence followed in the standard accounts: that
is, while the standard emergence direction is that of decreasing
fundamentality---in that there is emergence of less fundamental, high-level
entities, out of more fundamental, low-level entities---in these cases of
duality, on the contrary, a more fundamental entity can emerge out of a less
fundamental one. In fact, this possibility can be traced back to the existence
of different classical limits in quantum field theories and string theories.

the total entropy production in the system and its environment. For overdamped
dynamics, any generalized current is bounded by the total rate of entropy
production. We show that this entropic bound on the magnitude of generalized
currents imposes power-efficiency tradeoff relations for ratchets in contact
with a heat bath: Maximum efficiency---Carnot efficiency for a
Smoluchowski-Feynman ratchet and unity for a flashing or rocking ratchet---can
only be reached at vanishing power output. For underdamped dynamics, while
there may be reversible currents that are not bounded by the entropy production
rate, we show that the output power and heat absorption rate are irreversible
currents and thus obey the same bound. As a consequence, a power-efficiency
tradeoff relation holds not only for underdamped ratchets but also for
periodically driven heat engines. For weak driving, the bound results in
additional constraints on the Onsager matrix beyond those imposed by the Second
Law. Finally, we discuss the connection between heat and entropy in a

magneto-structural ground state can be tuned from ""pure"" nematic - paramagnetic

magnetically ordered and orthorhombic state to a magnetically ordered state
without an orthorhombic lattice distortion. The magnetic hyperfine field
increases monotonically over a wide pressure range. However, the orthorhombic
distortion initially decreases under increasing pressure, but is stabilized by
cooperative coupling to the pressure-induced magnetic order. Close to the
reported maximum of the superconducting critical temperature Tc (occuring at p

tetragonal down to the lowest temperature measured. Analysis of the structural

stars point to a chemical differentiation between both types of disks, with a
lower detection rate of molecules in disks around hotter stars. To investigate
the potential underlying causes we perform a comparative study of the chemistry
of T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be disks, using a model that pays special attention to
photochemistry. The warmer disk temperatures and higher ultraviolet flux of
Herbig stars compared to T Tauri stars induce some differences in the disk
chemistry. In the hot inner regions, H2O, and simple organic molecules like
C2H2, HCN, and CH4 are predicted to be very abundant in T Tauri disks and even
more in Herbig Ae/Be disks, in contrast with infrared observations that find a
much lower detection rate of water and simple organics toward disks around
hotter stars. In the outer regions, the model indicates that the molecules
typically observed in disks, like HCN, CN, C2H, H2CO, CS, SO, and HCO+, do not
have drastic abundance differences between T Tauri and Herbig Ae disks. Some
species produced under the action of photochemistry, like C2H and CN, are
predicted to have slightly lower abundances around Herbig Ae stars due to a
narrowing of the photochemically active layer. Observations indeed suggest that
these radicals are somewhat less abundant in Herbig Ae disks, although in any
case the inferred abundance differences are small, of a factor of a few at
most. A clear chemical differentiation between both types of disks concerns
ices, which are expected to be more abundant in Herbig Ae disks. The global
chemical behavior of T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be disks is quite similar. The main
differences are driven by the warmer temperatures of the latter, which result
in a larger reservoir or water and simple organics in the inner regions and a
lower mass of ices in the outer disk.

initial object mask is given in the first frame of an input video. We propose a
novel spatio-temporal Markov Random Field (MRF) model defined over pixels to
handle this problem. Unlike conventional MRF models, the spatial dependencies
among pixels in our model are encoded by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Specifically, for a given object, the probability of a labeling to a set of
spatially neighboring pixels can be predicted by a CNN trained for this
specific object. As a result, higher-order, richer dependencies among pixels in
the set can be implicitly modeled by the CNN. With temporal dependencies
established by optical flow, the resulting MRF model combines both spatial and
temporal cues for tackling video object segmentation. However, performing
inference in the MRF model is very difficult due to the very high-order
dependencies. To this end, we propose a novel CNN-embedded algorithm to perform
approximate inference in the MRF. This algorithm proceeds by alternating
between a temporal fusion step and a feed-forward CNN step. When initialized
with an appearance-based one-shot segmentation CNN, our model outperforms the
winning entries of the DAVIS 2017 Challenge, without resorting to model
ensembling or any dedicated detectors.

three parts, which are feature extraction block, stacked information

proposed enhancement unit mixes together two different types of features and
the compression unit distills more useful information for the sequential

observations. We study the magnetic field in the massive infrared dark cloud
G035.39-00.33 from dust continuum polarization observations at 850 $\micron$
with SCUBA-2/POL-2 at JCMT. The magnetic field tends to be perpendicular to the
densest part of the main filament (F$_{M}$), whereas it has a less defined
relative orientation in the rest of the structure, where it tends to be
parallel to some diffuse regions. A mean plane-of-the-sky magnetic field
strength of $\sim$50 $\mu$G for F$_{M}$ is obtained using
Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. Based on $^{13}$CO (1-0) line observations,
we suggest a formation scenario of F$_{M}$ due to large-scale ($\sim$10 pc)
cloud-cloud collision. Using additional NH$_3$ line data, we estimate that
F$_{M}$ will be gravitationally unstable if it is only supported by thermal
pressure and turbulence. The northern part of F$_{M}$, however, can be
stabilized by a modest additional support from the local magnetic field. The
middle and southern parts of F$_{M}$ are likely unstable even if the magnetic
field support is taken into account. We claim that the clumps in F$_{M}$ may be
supported by turbulence and magnetic fields against gravitational collapse.
Finally, we identified for the first time a massive ($\sim$200 M$_{\sun}$),
collapsing starless clump candidate, ""c8"", in G035.39-00.33. The magnetic field

including those of comparable mass. It has long been established that the
effect of such interactions on galaxy morphology depends strongly on the
orbital configuration, in particular the orientation of the intrinsic spin of
the galactic disk with respect to its orbital angular momentum. Prograde
encounters modify the morphology strongly, including the formation of tidally
induced bars, while retrograde flybys should have little effect on morphology.
Recent works on the subject reached conflicting conclusions, one using the
impulse approximation and claiming no dependence on this angle in the
properties of tidal bars. To resolve the controversy, we performed
self-consistent N-body simulations of hyperbolic encounters between two
identical Milky Way-like galaxies assuming different velocities and impact
parameters, with one of the galaxies on a prograde and the other on a
retrograde orbit. The galaxies were initially composed of an exponential
stellar disk and an NFW dark halo, and were stable against bar formation in
isolation for 3 Gyr. We find that strong tidally induced bars form only in
galaxies on prograde orbits. For smaller impact parameters and lower relative
velocities the bars are stronger and have lower pattern speeds. Stronger bars
undergo extended periods of buckling instability that thicken their vertical
structure. The encounters also lead to the formation of two-armed spirals with
strength inversely proportional to the strength of the bars. We conclude that
proper modeling of prograde and retrograde encounters cannot rely on the
simplest impulse approximation.

approach for large-scale image retrieval. It aims to learn a compact bitwise
representation for images via deep networks, so that similar images are mapped
to nearby hash codes. Since a deep network model usually has a large number of
parameters, it may probably be too complicated for the training data we have,
leading to model over-fitting. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose
a simple two-stage pipeline to learn deep hashing models, by regularizing the
deep hashing networks using fake images. The first stage is to generate fake
images from the original training set without extra data, via a generative
adversarial network (GAN). In the second stage, we propose a deep architec-
ture to learn hash functions, in which we use a maximum-entropy based loss to
incorporate the newly created fake images by the GAN. We show that this loss
acts as a strong regularizer of the deep architecture, by penalizing
low-entropy output hash codes. This loss can also be interpreted as a model
ensemble by simultaneously training many network models with massive weight
sharing but over different training sets. Empirical evaluation results on
several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method has superior
performance gains over state-of-the-art hashing methods.

thanks to artificial deep neural networks that achieved a great success in many

to easily crafted adversarial examples. Many investigations have pointed out
this fact and different approaches have been proposed to generate attacks while
adding a limited perturbation to the original data. The most robust known
method so far is the so called C&W attack [1]. Nonetheless, a countermeasure
known as feature squeezing coupled with ensemble defense showed that most of
these attacks can be destroyed [6]. In this paper, we present a new method we
call Centered Initial Attack (CIA) whose advantage is twofold : first, it
insures by construction the maximum perturbation to be smaller than a threshold
fixed beforehand, without the clipping process that degrades the quality of
attacks. Second, it is robust against recently introduced defenses such as
feature squeezing, JPEG encoding and even against a voting ensemble of
defenses. While its application is not limited to images, we illustrate this
using five of the current best classifiers on ImageNet dataset among which two
are adversarialy retrained on purpose to be robust against attacks. With a
fixed maximum perturbation of only 1.5% on any pixel, around 80% of attacks
(targeted) fool the voting ensemble defense and nearly 100% when the
perturbation is only 6%. While this shows how it is difficult to defend against
CIA attacks, the last section of the paper gives some guidelines to limit their

star formation histories. Some of them formed the majority of their stars very
late compared to the others. Extreme examples are Leo A and Aquarius which
reached the peak of star formation at $z<1$ ( > 6 Gyr after BB). This fact
seemingly challenges the LCDM cosmology because the dark matter halos of these
galaxies on average should assemble the majority of their masses before z~2 (<3
Gyr after BB). In this work we investigate whether the delayed star formation
histories of some irregular dwarf galaxies could be explained purely by the
stochasticity of their mass assembly histories coupled with the effect of
cosmic reionization. We develop a semi-analytic model to follow the accretion
of baryonic matter, star formation and stellar feedback in dark matter halos
with present day virial masses 10^9 M_Sun < M < 10^11 M_Sun and with different
stochastic growth histories obtained using the PINOCCHIO code based on
Lagrangian perturbation theory. We obtain the distributions of observable
parameters and the evolution histories for these galaxies. Accretion of
baryonic matter is strongly suppressed after the epoch of reionization in some
models but they continue to accrete dark matter and eventually reach enough
mass for accretion of baryonic matter to begin again. These ""reborn"" model
galaxies show very similar delayed star formation histories to those of Leo A
and Aquarius. We find that the stochasticity caused by mass assembly histories
is enhanced in systems with virial masses ~10^10 M_Sun because of their
sensitivity to the photoionizing intergalactic radiation field after the epoch
of reionization. This results in qualitatively different star formation
histories in late- and early-forming galaxies and it might explain the peculiar
star formation histories of irregular dwarf galaxies such as Leo A and
Aquarius.

quantum key distribution (QKD), the security of most existing QKD
implementations is not rigorously established yet. A critical obstacle is that
almost all existing security proofs make ideal assumptions on the QKD devices.
Problematically, such assumptions are hard to satisfy in the experiments, and
therefore it is not obvious how to apply such security proofs to practical QKD
systems. Fortunately, any imperfections and security-loopholes in the
measurement devices can be perfectly closed by measurement-device-independent
QKD (MDI-QKD), and thus we only need to consider how to secure the source
devices. Among imperfections in the source devices, correlations between the
sending pulses are one of the principal problems. In this paper, we consider a
setting-choice-independent correlation (SCIC) framework in which the sending
pulses can present arbitrary correlations but they are independent of the
previous setting choices such as the bit, the basis and the intensity settings.
Within the framework of SCIC, we consider the dominant fluctuations of the
sending states, such as the relative phases and the intensities, and provide a
self-contained information theoretic security proof for the loss-tolerant QKD
protocol in the finite-key regime. We demonstrate the feasibility of secure
quantum communication within a reasonable number of pulses sent, and thus we
are convinced that our work constitutes a crucial step toward guaranteeing
implementation security of QKD.

This necessarily requires one to evaluate the Bayesian evidence many thousands
of times over, which is numerically challenging. We show how this can be done
using a number of simplifying assumptions and discuss their validity. We also
modify the form of the expected utility, as previously introduced in the
literature in different contexts, in order to partition each possible future
into either the rejection of models at the level of the maximum likelihood or
the decision between models using Bayesian model comparison. We then quantify
the ability of future experiments to constrain the reheating temperature and
the scalar running. Our approach allows us to discuss possible strategies for
maximising information from future cosmological surveys. In particular, our
conclusions suggest that, in the context of inflationary model selection, a
decrease in the measurement uncertainty of the scalar spectral index would be
more decisive than a decrease in the uncertainty in the tensor-to-scalar ratio.

statistical tests to identify whether a particular experimental treatment has
caused a significant change in a rhythmic signal. When these signals display
nonstationary behaviour, as is common in many biological systems, the
established methodologies may be misleading. Therefore, there is a real need
for new methodology that enables the formal comparison of nonstationary
processes. As circadian behaviour is best understood in the spectral domain,
here we develop novel hypothesis testing procedures in the (wavelet) spectral
domain, embedding replicate information when available. The data are modelled
as realisations of locally stationary wavelet processes, allowing us to define
and rigorously estimate their evolutionary wavelet spectra. Motivated by three
complementary applications in circadian biology, our new methodology allows the
identification of three specific types of spectral difference. We demonstrate
the advantages of our methodology over alternative approaches, by means of a
comprehensive simulation study and real data applications, using both published
and newly generated circadian datasets. In contrast to the current standard
methodologies, our method successfully identifies differences within the
motivating circadian datasets, and facilitates wider ranging analyses of
rhythmic biological data in general.

genomic DNA through computer simulations performed with a coarse-grained model.
The model was developed specifically to study the switch of H-NS proteins from
the DNA-stiffening to the DNA-bridging mode, which has been observed repeatedly
upon addition of multivalent cations to the buffer, but is still not
understood. Unravelling the corresponding mechanism is all the more crucial, as
the regulation properties of H-NS proteins, as well as other nucleoid proteins,
are linked to their DNA-binding properties. The simulations reported here
support a mechanism, according to which the primary role of multivalent cations
consists in decreasing the strength of H-NS/DNA interactions compared to
H-NS/H-NS interactions, with the latter ones becoming energetically favored
with respect to the former ones above a certain threshold of the effective
valency of the cations of the buffer. Below the threshold, H-NS dimers form
filaments, which stretch along the DNA molecule but are quite inefficient in
bridging genomically distant DNA sites (DNA-stiffening mode). In contrast, just
above the threshold, H-NS dimers form 3-dimensional clusters, which are able to
connect DNA sites that are distant from the genomic point of view (DNA-bridging
mode). The model provides clear rationales for the experimental observations
that the switch between the two modes is a threshold effect and that the
ability of H-NS dimers to form higher order oligomers is crucial for their
bridging capabilities.

situation is not so well understood for dictionary-based compression. A
plausible lower bound is $b$, the least number of phrases of a general
bidirectional parse of a text, where phrases can be copied from anywhere else
in the text. Since computing $b$ is NP-complete, a popular gold standard is
$z$, the number of phrases in the Lempel-Ziv parse of the text, which is the
optimal one when phrases can be copied only from the left. While $z$ can be
computed in linear time with a greedy algorithm, almost nothing has been known
for decades about its approximation ratio with respect to $b$. In this paper we
prove that $z=O(b\log(n/b))$, where $n$ is the text length. We also show that
the bound is tight as a function of $n$, by exhibiting a text family where $z =
\Omega(b\log n)$. Our upper bound is obtained by building a run-length
context-free grammar based on a locally consistent parsing of the text. Our
lower bound is obtained by relating $b$ with $r$, the number of equal-letter
runs in the Burrows-Wheeler transform of the text. We proceed by observing that
Lempel-Ziv is just one particular case of greedy parses, meaning that the
optimal value of $z$ is obtained by scanning the text and maximizing the phrase
length at each step, and of ordered parses, meaning that there is an increasing
order between phrases and their sources. As a new example of ordered greedy
parses, we introduce {\em lexicographical} parses, where phrases can only be
copied from lexicographically smaller text locations. We prove that the size
$v$ of the optimal lexicographical parse is also obtained greedily in $O(n)$
time, that $v=O(b\log(n/b))$, and that there exists a text family where $v =
\Omega(b\log n)$.

increased the interest in deep learning driven de novo drug design. However,
assessing the performance of such generative models is notoriously difficult.
Metrics that are typically used to assess the performance of such generative
models are the percentage of chemically valid molecules or the similarity to
real molecules in terms of particular descriptors, such as the partition
coefficient (logP) or druglikeness. However, method comparison is difficult
because of the inconsistent use of evaluation metrics, the necessity for
multiple metrics, and the fact that some of these measures can easily be
tricked by simple rule-based systems. We propose a novel distance measure
between two sets of molecules, called Fr\'echet ChemNet distance (FCD), that
can be used as an evaluation metric for generative models. The FCD is similar
to a recently established performance metric for comparing image generation
methods, the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). Whereas the FID uses one of
the hidden layers of InceptionNet, the FCD utilizes the penultimate layer of a
deep neural network called ChemNet, which was trained to predict drug
activities. Thus, the FCD metric takes into account chemically and biologically
relevant information about molecules, and also measures the diversity of the
set via the distribution of generated molecules. The FCD's advantage over
previous metrics is that it can detect if generated molecules are a) diverse
and have similar b) chemical and c) biological properties as real molecules. We
further provide an easy-to-use implementation that only requires the SMILES
representation of the generated molecules as input to calculate the FCD.

several improvements to mitigate these issues: First, self-attention memory
grows quadratically in the sequence length, which we address through a
downsampling technique. Second, we find that previous approaches to incorporate

representations and hybrid models to this end. Third, to stress the importance
of local context in the acoustic signal, we propose a Gaussian biasing approach

compressed self-indexes based on dictionary compression, a rich and
heterogeneous family that exploits text repetitions in different ways. For each
such compression scheme, several different indexing solutions have been
proposed in the last two decades. To date, the fastest indexes for repetitive
texts are based on the run-length compressed Burrows-Wheeler transform and on
the Compact Directed Acyclic Word Graph. The most space-efficient indexes, on
the other hand, are based on the Lempel-Ziv parsing and on grammar compression.
Indexes for more universal schemes such as collage systems and macro schemes
have not yet been proposed. Very recently, Kempa and Prezza [STOC 2018] showed
that all dictionary compressors can be interpreted as approximation algorithms
for the smallest string attractor, that is, a set of text positions capturing
all distinct substrings. Starting from this observation, in this paper we
develop the first universal compressed self-index, that is, the first indexing
data structure based on string attractors, which can therefore be built on top
of any dictionary-compressed text representation. Let $\gamma$ be the size of a
string attractor for a text of length $n$. Our index takes
$O(\gamma\log(n/\gamma))$ words of space and supports locating the $occ$
occurrences of any pattern of length $m$ in $O(m\log n + occ\log^{\epsilon}n)$
time, for any constant $\epsilon>0$. This is, in particular, the first index
for general macro schemes and collage systems. Our result shows that the
relation between indexing and compression is much deeper than what was
previously thought: the simple property standing at the core of all dictionary
compressors is sufficient to support fast indexed queries.

(WDMS) binaries from the Large Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope
(LAMOST). The catalogue contains 876 WDMS binaries, of which 757 are additions
to our previous LAMOST DR1 sample and 357 are systems that have not been
published before. We also describe a LAMOST-dedicated survey that aims at
obtaining spectra of photometrically-selected WDMS binaries from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that are expected to contain cool white dwarfs and/or
early type M dwarf companions. This is a population under-represented in
previous SDSS WDMS binary catalogues. We determine the stellar parameters
(white dwarf effective temperatures, surface gravities and masses, and M dwarf
spectral types) of the LAMOST DR5 WDMS binaries and make use of the parameter
distributions to analyse the properties of the sample. We find that, despite
our efforts, systems containing cool white dwarfs remain under-represented.
Moreover, we make use of LAMOST DR5 and SDSS DR14 (when available) spectra to
measure the Na I {\lambda}{\lambda} 8183.27, 8194.81 absorption doublet and/or
H{\alpha} emission radial velocities of our systems. This allows identifying
128 binaries displaying significant radial velocity variations, 76 of which are
new. Finally, we cross-match our catalogue with the Catalina Surveys and
identify 57 systems displaying light curve variations. These include 16
eclipsing systems, two of which are new, and nine binaries that are new
eclipsing candidates. We calculate periodograms from the photometric data and
measure (estimate) the orbital periods of 30 (15) WDMS binaries.

any probability distribution $\pi$. There has been recently much work devoted
to the development of variants of the MH update which can handle scenarios
where such an evaluation is impossible, and yet are guaranteed to sample from
$\pi$ asymptotically. The most popular approach to have emerged is arguably the
pseudo-marginal MH algorithm which substitutes an unbiased estimate of an
unnormalised version of $\pi$ for $\pi$. Alternative pseudo-marginal algorithms
relying instead on unbiased estimates of the MH acceptance ratio have also been
proposed. These algorithms can have better properties than standard PM
algorithms. Convergence properties of both classes of algorithms are known to
depend on the variability of the estimators involved and reduced variability is
guaranteed to decrease the asymptotic variance of ergodic averages and will
shorten the burn-in period, or convergence to equilibrium, in most scenarios of
interest. A simple approach to reduce variability, amenable to parallel
computations, consists of averaging independent estimators. However, while
averaging estimators of $\pi$ in a pseudo-marginal algorithm retains the
guarantee of sampling from $\pi$ asymptotically, naive averaging of acceptance
ratio estimates breaks detailed balance, leading to incorrect results. We
propose an original methodology which allows for a correct implementation of
this idea. We establish theoretical properties which parallel those available
for standard PM algorithms and discussed above. We demonstrate the interest of
the approach on various inference problems. In particular we show that
convergence to equilibrium can be significantly shortened, therefore offering
the possibility to reduce a user's waiting time in a generic fashion when a
parallel computing architecture is available.

holonomy reductions of the canonical projective tractor/Cartan connection. This
leads to a characterisation of Sasaki-Einstein structures as projective

application, this is used to describe the projective compactification of
indefinite (suitably) complete non-compact Sasaki-Einstein structures and to
prove that the boundary at infinity is a Fefferman conformal manifold that thus
fibres over a nondegenerate CR manifold (of hypersurface type). We prove that
this CR manifold coincides with the boundary at infinity for the c-projective
compactification of the K\""ahler-Einstein manifold that arises, in the usual
way, as a leaf space for the defining Killing field of the given

significant step towards constraining the nuclear matter equation of state by
using the tidal Love numbers (TLNs) of the merging neutron stars. Measuring or
constraining the neutron star TLNs allows us in principle to exclude or
constraint many equations of state. This approach, however, has the drawback
that many modified theories of gravity could produce deviations from General
Relativity similar to the deviations coming from the uncertainties in the
equation of state. The first and the most natural step in resolving the
mentioned problem is to quantify the effects on the TLNs from the modifications
of General Relativity. With this motivation in mind, in the present paper we
calculate the TLNs of (non-rotating) neutron stars in $f(R)$ gravity. For this
purpose, we first derived the equations describing both the polar and the axial
stationary perturbations of neutron stars in a particular class of $f(R)$
gravity, the so-called $R^2$-gravity. Then, by solving numerically the
perturbation equations, we calculate explicitly the polar and the axial $l=2$
TLNs of the neutron stars in $R^2$-gravity for three characteristic realistic
equations of state. Our results show that while the polar TLNs are slightly
influenced by the $R^2$ modification of General Relativity, the axial TLNs can
be several times larger (in terms of the absolute value) compared to the
general relativistic case.

major constituent techniques from different areas of computer science and
engineering that have been employed by such ASE tools. To develop the
characterization we carried out an extensive systematic literature review over
about 1175 ASE research articles. One of our key goal was to identify useful
relationships among ASE tools, their constituent techniques and the software
development life cycle activities that these tools targeted. In terms of
changes in popularity of constituent techniques with time we did not observe
any clear trend. We organized the results of our characterization as a taxonomy
called SEAT (Software Engineering Automation Taxonomy). A salient feature of
SEAT is that it focuses on automation of activities from all phases of SDLC.
Such a taxonomy, among other applications, shall enable synthesizing new
automation tools for different SDLC activities. Recomposing existing systems to
achieve better features will also be possible. Further, the taxonomy has been
realized as a graph database using neo4j(an open source graph database), which
can be queried using an SQL like language. The graph database allowed us to
uncover hidden relationships by way of exhaustive search for connections and
paths between different nodes (i.e. concepts). We demonstrate the efficacy of

and discriminative models), and (iii) work across different programming
languages.
  We evaluate our approach on the tasks of predicting variable names, method
names, and full types. We use our representation to drive both CRF-based and
word2vec-based learning, for programs of four languages: JavaScript, Java,
Python and C\#. Our evaluation shows that our approach obtains better results
than task-specific handcrafted representations across different tasks and

infinitesimal weak rigidity for planar frameworks. The weak rigidity matrix is
used to directly check if a framework is infinitesimally weakly rigid while
previous work can check a weak rigidity of a framework indirectly. An
infinitesimal weak rigidity framework can be uniquely determined up to a
translation and a rotation (and a scaling also when the framework does not
include any edge) by its inter-neighbor distances and angles. We apply the new
concepts to a three-agent formation control problem with a gradient control
law, and prove instability of the control system at any incorrect equilibrium
point and convergence to a desired target formation. Also, we propose a
modified Henneberg construction, which is a technique to generate minimally
rigid (or weakly rigid) graphs. Finally, we extend the concept of the weak
rigidity in R^2 to the concept in R^3.

state of the art in terms of system accuracy. However, the predicted labels
should not be regarded as the only core output; also important is a
well-calibrated estimate of the prediction uncertainty. Such estimates and
their calibration are critical in many practical applications. Despite their
obvious aforementioned advantage in relation to accuracy, contemporary neural
networks can, generally, be regarded as poorly calibrated and as such do not
produce reliable output probability estimates. Further, while post-processing
calibration solutions can be found in the relevant literature, these tend to be
for systems performing classification. In this regard, we herein present two
novel methods for acquiring calibrated predictions intervals for neural network
regressors: empirical calibration and temperature scaling. In experiments using
different regression tasks from the audio and computer vision domains, we find
that both our proposed methods are indeed capable of producing calibrated
prediction intervals for neural network regressors with any desired confidence
level, a finding that is consistent across all datasets and neural network
architectures we experimented with. In addition, we derive an additional
practical recommendation for producing more accurate calibrated prediction
intervals. We release the source code implementing our proposed methods for
computing calibrated predicted intervals. The code for computing calibrated
predicted intervals is publicly available.

and the nodes need to verify this proof by looking at only their local
neighborhood in the system.
  Previous works have studied the model where each node is given its own,

there exists properties that exhibit these relative proof sizes, and also
properties that are somewhere in between. In addition, we introduce a new lower

combining fast and highly scalable methods such as an FFT-based pressure
solver, with the evolution equation for non-Newtonian (including
elastoviscoplastic) stresses. In this flexible computational framework, the
fluid can be modelled by either Oldroyd-B, neo-Hookean, FENE-P, and Saramito
EVP models, and the additional equations for the non-Newtonian stresses are
fully coupled with the flow. The rigid particles are discretized on a moving

The solid particles are represented by an Immersed Boundary method (IBM) with a
computationally efficient direct forcing method allowing simulations of a large

surface and then included in the momentum equations as a body force. The

this paper we provide an upper bound on the charge stiffness and show that
(similarly as at zero temperature), for T >0 and U/t>0 it vanishes in the limit
of zero hole concentration within the canonical ensemble in the thermodynamic

as well within the grand-canonical ensemble in the infinite lattice length

charge ballistic transport indicates that charge transport at finite
temperatures is dominated by a diffusive contribution. Our scheme uses a
suitable exact representation of the electrons in terms of rotated electrons
for which the numbers of singly occupied and doubly occupied lattice sites are
good quantum numbers for U/t>0. In contrast to often less controllable
numerical studies, the use of such a representation reveals the carriers that
couple to the charge probes and provides useful physical information on the

laboratory for the study of star formation in extreme environments and the
physics of very massive stars. In order to determine the fundamental physical
properties of both cluster and constituent stars, we provide and analyse new
HST+VLT near-IR datasets. Stacking multiple epochs of spectroscopy results in
the deepest view of the cluster ever obtained, allowing us to to identify
candidate giant and main sequence stars for the first time. All cluster members
are found to be WNLh or O stars, with the smooth and continuous progression in
spectral morphologies from O super-/hypergiants through to the WNLh cohort
implying a direct evolutionary connection. Importantly no H-free Wolf-Rayets
are found, while no products of binary interaction/mass-transfer may be
unambiguously identified, despite the presence of massive binaries within the
Arches. We infer a main sequence turn-off around O4-5V, corresponding to
~30-38Msun, while the eclipsing binary F2 implies current masses of ~80Msun and
~60Msun for the WNLh and O hypergiant cohorts, respectively. A cluster age of
~2-3Myr is suggested by the location of the main-sequence turn-off. While the
absence of H-free Wolf-Rayets argues against the prior occurrence of SNe, such
an age does accommodate such events for exceptionally massive stars. Future
progress requires quantitative analysis of cluster members combined with
additional spectroscopic observations to better constrain the binary
population; nevertheless it is already abundantly clear that the Arches offers
an unprecedented insight into the formation, evolution and death of the most
massive stars Nature allows to form in the local universe (Abridged).

where classic synthesis fails, such as in the synthesis of distributed systems.
In this paper, we study the constraint solving problem behind bounded
synthesis. We consider different reductions of the bounded synthesis problem of
linear-time temporal logic (LTL) to constraint systems given as boolean
formulas (SAT), quantified boolean formulas (QBF), and dependency quantified
boolean formulas (DQBF). The reductions represent different trade-offs between
conciseness and algorithmic efficiency. In the SAT encoding, both inputs and
states of the system are represented explicitly; in QBF, inputs are symbolic
and states are explicit; in DQBF, both inputs and states are symbolic. We
evaluate the encodings systematically using benchmarks from the reactive

perhaps surprising, empirical finding is that QBF clearly dominates both SAT

computing and learning capabilities of the brain. But computing and learning
capabilities of RSNN models have remained poor, at least in comparison with
artificial neural networks (ANNs). We address two possible reasons for that.
One is that RSNNs in the brain are not randomly connected or designed according
to simple rules, and they do not start learning as a tabula rasa network.
Rather, RSNNs in the brain were optimized for their tasks through evolution,
development, and prior experience. Details of these optimization processes are
largely unknown. But their functional contribution can be approximated through
powerful optimization methods, such as backpropagation through time (BPTT).
  A second major mismatch between RSNNs in the brain and models is that the
latter only show a small fraction of the dynamics of neurons and synapses in
the brain. We include neurons in our RSNN model that reproduce one prominent
dynamical process of biological neurons that takes place at the behaviourally
relevant time scale of seconds: neuronal adaptation. We denote these networks
as LSNNs because of their Long short-term memory. The inclusion of adapting
neurons drastically increases the computing and learning capability of RSNNs if
they are trained and configured by deep learning (BPTT combined with a rewiring
algorithm that optimizes the network architecture). In fact, the computational
performance of these RSNNs approaches for the first time that of LSTM networks.
In addition RSNNs with adapting neurons can acquire abstract knowledge from
prior learning in a Learning-to-Learn (L2L) scheme, and transfer that knowledge
in order to learn new but related tasks from very few examples. We demonstrate
this for supervised learning and reinforcement learning.

publishing it can come along with a lot of visibility. The question arises how
reliable are our evaluation methodologies to compare approaches?
  One common methodology to identify the state-of-the-art is to partition data
into a train, a development and a test set. Researchers can train and tune
their approach on some part of the dataset and then select the model that
worked best on the development set for a final evaluation on unseen test data.
Test scores from different approaches are compared, and performance differences
are tested for statistical significance.
  In this publication, we show that there is a high risk that a statistical
significance in this type of evaluation is not due to a superior learning
approach. Instead, there is a high risk that the difference is due to chance.
For example for the CoNLL 2003 NER dataset we observed in up to 26% of the
cases type I errors (false positives) with a threshold of p < 0.05, i.e.,
falsely concluding a statistically significant difference between two identical

displacement field and is therefore well suited for studying defect
propagation. Here, bond-based peridynamic theory is used to study the
equilibrium and steady propagation of a lattice defect -- a kink -- in one
dimension. The material transforms locally, from one state to another, as the
kink passes through. The kink is in equilibrium if the applied force is less
than a certain critical value that is calculated, and propagates if it exceeds
that value. The kinetic relation giving the propagation speed as a function of
the applied force is also derived.
  In addition, it is shown that the dynamical solutions of certain
differential-equation-based models of a continuum are the same as those of the
peridynamic model provided the micromodulus function is chosen suitably. A
formula for calculating the micromodulus function of the equivalent peridynamic
model is derived and illustrated. This ability to replace a
differential-equation-based model with a peridynamic one may prove useful when
numerically studying more complicated problems such as those involving multiple

models using a rule-based methodology. The intraday, intraweek, and intrayear
seasonality in load are accommodated using a rule-based triple seasonal
adaptation of a seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARMA) model. We find
that, for application to French load, the method requires an important

special day effects on an hourly basis using indicator variables. Using a rule
formulated specifically for the French load, we compare the SARMA models with a
range of different benchmark methods based on an evaluation of their point and
density forecast accuracy. As sophisticated benchmarks, we employ the
rule-based triple seasonal adaptations of Holt-Winters-Taylor (HWT) exponential

half-hourly French load data, and consider lead times ranging from one
half-hour up to a day ahead. The rule-based SARMA approach generated the most

realization of a stationary and finite-range (say, range unity) ensemble of

of size $\ell\gg 1$ and of vanishing average, we are interested in an algorithm
to compute the (gradient of the) solution near the origin, just using the
knowledge of the (given realization of the) coefficient field in some large box
of size $L\gg\ell$. More precisely, we are interested in the most seamless
(artificial) boundary condition on the boundary of the computational domain of
size $L$.
  Motivated by the recently introduced multipole expansion in random media, we
propose an algorithm. We rigorously establish an error estimate (on the level
of the gradient) in terms of $L\gg\ell\gg 1$, using recent results in
quantitative stochastic homogenization. More precisely, our error estimate has
an a priori and an a posteriori aspect: With a priori overwhelming probability,
the (random) prefactor can be bounded by a constant that is computable without
much further effort, on the basis of the given realization in the box of size
$L$.
  We also rigorously establish that the order of the error estimate in both $L$
and $\ell$ is optimal, where in this paper we focus on the case of $d=2$. This
amounts to a lower bound on the variance of the quantity of interest when
conditioned on the coefficients inside the computational domain, and relies on
the deterministic insight that a sensitivity analysis wrt a defect commutes
with (stochastic) homogenization. Finally, we carry out numerical experiments
that show that this optimal convergence rate already sets in at only moderately
large $L$, and that more naive boundary conditions perform worse both in terms

unanswered questions remain concerning remodeling of autophagic membranes.
Here, we focus on the advantages of theoretical modelling to study the
formation of autophagosomes and to understand the origin of autophagosomal
membranes. Starting from the well-defined geometry of final autophagosomes we
ask the question of how these organelles can be formed by combining various
preautophagosomal membranes such as vesicles, membrane tubules or sheets. We
analyse the geometric constraints of autophagosome formation by taking the area
of the precursor membranes and their internal volume into account. Our results
suggest that vesicle fusion contributes little to the formation of
autophagosomes. In the second part we quantify the curvature of the precursors
and report that the formation of autophagosomes is associated with a strong
relaxation of membrane curvature energy. This effect we find for a wide range
of membrane asymmetries. It is especially strong for small distances between
both autophagosomal membranes, as observed in vivo. We quantify the membrane
bending energies of all precursors by considering membrane asymmetries. We
propose that the generation and supply of pre-autophagosomal membranes is one
limiting step for autophagosome formation.

all number fields with Galois group $G$. We do this by studying a group
theoretic condition called generalized $G$-type, which is a necessary condition
for a number field with Galois group $H$ to be contained in that compositum. In
general, group theory allows one to reduce the original problem to the question
of finding rational points on finitely many modular curves. To illustrate this
method we completely determine which torsion structures occur for elliptic
curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ and base-changed to the compositum of all
fields whose Galois group is $A_4$.

exceptionally low latency, especially for workloads with a high volume of very

integrated with a receiver-driven flow control mechanism. Homa also uses
controlled overcommitment of receiver downlinks to ensure efficient bandwidth
utilization at high load. Our implementation of Homa delivers 99th percentile
round-trip times less than 15{\mu}s for short messages on a 10 Gbps network
running at 80% load. These latencies are almost 100x lower than the best
published measurements of an implementation. In simulations, Homa's latency is

formed via secular evolution of the thin disc, the origin of their metal-poor
counterparts is still under debate. Two different origins have been invoked for
metal-poor stars: they might be classical bulge stars or stars formed via
internal evolution of a massive thick disc. We use N-body simulations to
calculate the kinematic signature given by the difference in the mean
Galactocentric radial velocity ($\Delta\rm V_{\rm GC}$) between metal-rich
stars ([Fe/H] $\ge$ 0) and moderately metal-poor stars (-1.0 $\le$ [Fe/H] $<$
0) in two models, one containing a thin disc and a small classical bulge
(B/D=0.1), and the other containing a thin disc and a massive centrally
concentrated thick disc. We reasonably assume that thin-disk stars in each
model may be considered as a proxy of metal-rich stars. Similarly, bulge stars
and thick-disc stars may be considered as a proxy of metal-poor stars. We
calculate $\Delta\rm V_{\rm GC}$ at different latitudes ($b=0^\circ$,
$-2^\circ$, $-4^\circ$,$-6^\circ$, $-8^\circ$ and $-10^\circ$) and longitudes
($l=0^\circ$, $\pm5^\circ$, $\pm10^\circ$ and $\pm15^\circ$) and show that the
$\Delta\rm V_{\rm GC}$ trends predicted by the two models are different. We
compare the predicted results with ARGOS data and APOGEE DR13 data and show
that moderately metal-poor stars are well reproduced with the co-spatial
stellar discs model, which has a massive thick disc. Our results give more
evidence against the scenario that most of the metal-poor stars are classical
bulge stars. If classical bulge stars exists, most of them probably have
metallicities [Fe/H] $<$ -1 dex, and their contribution to the mass of the
bulge should be a small percentage of the total bulge mass.

to the limited carrying capacity of the individual channels. If the channels
are coupled, blockage of one causes an increase in the flux entering the
remaining open channels leading to a cascade of failures. Once all channels are
blocked no additional particle can enter the system. If the blockages are of
finite duration, however, the system reaches a steady state with an exiting
flux that is reduced compared to the incoming one. We propose a stochastic
model consisting of $N_c$ channels each with a blocking threshold of $N$
particles. Particles enter the system according to a Poisson process with the
entering flux of intensity $\Lambda$ equally distributed over the open
channels. Any particle in an open channel exits at a rate $\mu$ and a blocked
channel unblocks at a rate $\mu^*$. We present a method to obtain the exiting
flux in the steady state, and other properties, for arbitrary $N_c$ and $N$ and
we present explicit solutions for $N_c=2,3$. We apply these results to compare
the efficiency of conveying a particulate stream of intensity $\Lambda$ using
different channel configurations. We compare a single ""robust"" channel with a
large capacity with multiple ""fragile"" channels with a proportionately reduced
capacity. The ""robust"" channel is more efficient at low intensity, while
multiple, ""fragile"" channels have a higher throughput at large intensity. We
also compare $N_c$ coupled channels with $N_c$ independent channels, both with
threshold $N=2$. For $N_c=2$ if $\mu^*/\mu>1/4$, the coupled channels are
always more efficient. Otherwise the independent channels are more efficient

studying the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial
perturbations. Very recently, Ma et al. (ICLR 2018) proposed to use local
intrinsic dimensionality (LID) in layer-wise hidden representations of DNNs to
study adversarial subspaces. It was demonstrated that LID can be used to
characterize the adversarial subspaces associated with different attack
methods, e.g., the Carlini and Wagner's (C&W) attack and the fast gradient sign
attack.
  In this paper, we use MNIST and CIFAR-10 to conduct two new sets of
experiments that are absent in existing LID analysis and report the limitation
of LID in characterizing the corresponding adversarial subspaces, which are (i)
oblivious attacks and LID analysis using adversarial examples with different
confidence levels; and (ii) black-box transfer attacks. For (i), we find that
the performance of LID is very sensitive to the confidence parameter deployed
by an attack, and the LID learned from ensembles of adversarial examples with
varying confidence levels surprisingly gives poor performance. For (ii), we
find that when adversarial examples are crafted from another DNN model, LID is
ineffective in characterizing their adversarial subspaces. These two findings
together suggest the limited capability of LID in characterizing the subspaces
of adversarial examples.

which mechanisms are responsible for their migration. One of the observable
tests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the
stellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the
main migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep
on evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The
observed correlation between effective temperature and measured projected
obliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such
mechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal
evolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide
for circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong
variations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their
consequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical
formulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for
each mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For
typical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped
on a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of
tidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with
Jupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant
orbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar
spin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the
evolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is
not slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,
we find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their
main-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation.

  The SIR inversion code is employed to retrieve the physical parameters of the
lower solar photosphere from the observed polarization signals. We follow two
different approaches. On the one hand, we consider that the multi-lobe circular
polarization signals are only produced by the line-of-sight variation of the
physical parameters. We therefore invert the data assuming a single atmospheric
component that occupies the entire resolution element in the horizontal plane
and where the physical parameters vary with optical depth (i.e.,
line-of-sight). On the other hand, we consider that the multi-lobe circular
polarization signals are produced not by the optical depth variations of the
physical parameters but instead by their horizontal variations. Here we invert
the data assuming that the resolution element is occupied by two different
atmospheric components where the kinematic and magnetic properties are constant
along the line-of-sight.
  Both approaches reveal some common features about the topology responsible
for the observed three-lobed Stokes V signals: both a strong (>1000 Gauss) and
a very weak (< 10 Gauss) magnetic field with opposite polarities and harboring
flows directed in opposite directions must co-exist (either vertically or
horizontally interlaced) within the resolution element.

perspectives of software as well as integrating and analyzing such data is
crucial for getting reliable and timely actionable insights aimed at
continuously managing software quality in Rapid Software Development (RSD). In
this context, several software analytics tools have been developed in recent
years. However, there is a lack of explainable software analytics that software
practitioners trust. Aims: We aimed at creating a quality model (called
Q-Rapids quality model) for actionable analytics in RSD, implementing it, and
evaluating its understandability and relevance. Method: We performed workshops
at four companies in order to determine relevant metrics as well as product and
process factors. We also elicited how these metrics and factors are used and
interpreted by practitioners when making decisions in RSD. We specified the
Q-Rapids quality model by comparing and integrating the results of the four
workshops. Then we implemented the Q-Rapids tool to support the usage of the
Q-Rapids quality model as well as the gathering, integration, and analysis of
the required data. Afterwards we installed the Q-Rapids tool in the four
companies and performed semi-structured interviews with eight product owners to
evaluate the understandability and relevance of the Q-Rapids quality model.
Results: The participants of the evaluation perceived the metrics as well as
the product and process factors of the Q-Rapids quality model as
understandable. Also, they considered the Q-Rapids quality model relevant for
identifying product and process deficiencies (e.g., blocking code situations).
Conclusions: By means of heterogeneous data sources, the Q-Rapids quality model
enables detecting problems that take more time to find manually and adds
transparency among the perspectives of system, process, and usage.

This technique permits to induce a magnetic anisotropy in cobalt ferrite in the

anisotropy revealed a higher longitudinal magnetostriction and piezomagnetism
compared to the isotropic sample, but the transversal magnetostriction and
piezomagnetism were dramatically reduced. In the case of magnetoelectric
layered composite, the magnetoelectric coefficient is directly related to the
sum of the longitudinal and transversal piezomagnetic coefficients. These two
coefficients being opposite in sign, the use of material exhibiting high
longitudinal and low transversal piezomagnetic coefficient (or vice versa) in
ME devices is expected to improve the ME effect. Hence, ME bilayer devices were
made using isotropic and anisotropic cobalt ferrite stuck with a PZT layer. ME

hadronically decaying top quarks and Higgs bosons reconstructed as large-radius

Model expectation is observed, and 95% CL upper limits are set on the
production cross sections for the different signal processes considered. These
cross-section limits are used to derive lower limits on the mass of a
vector-like $T$ quark under several branching ratio hypotheses assuming
contributions from $T \rightarrow Wb$, $Zt$, $Ht$ decays. The 95% CL observed
lower limits on the $T$ quark mass range between 0.99 TeV and 1.43 TeV for all
possible values of the branching ratios into the three decay modes considered,
significantly extending the reach beyond that of previous searches.
Additionally, upper limits on anomalous four-top-quark production are set in
the context of an effective field theory model, as well as in an universal

the sky localization uncertainty for gravitational waves from binary neutron
stars at 40, 200, 400, 800 and 1600Mpc, for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic

network consisting of the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer can enhance
the sky localization performance significantly - with the 90% credible region
of $\mathcal{O}(1) \text{deg}^2$ for most sources at $\leq200$Mpc and
$\leq100\text{deg}^2$ for most sources at $\leq1600$Mpc. We also investigate
the prospects for third generation detectors identifying the presence of a

signal-to-noise ratio of $\geq12$ and $\geq5.5$ for at least two
interferometers, and to have a 90% credible region for the sky localization
that is no larger than $100 \text{deg}^2$. We find that the Einstein Telescope
can send out such ""early-warning"" detection alerts 1 - 20 hours before merger

radiation reaction in flat spacetime is described by Lorenz-Dirac (LD)
equation, while in curved spacetime -- by DeWitt-Brehme (DWB) equation
containing the Ricci term and the tail term. We show that for the motion of
elementary particles in vacuum metrics the DWB equation can be reduced to the
covariant form of the LD equation which we use here. Generically, the LD
equation is plagued by runaway solutions, so we discuss computational ways to
avoid this problem in constructing numerical solutions. We also use the first
iteration of the covariant LD equation which is the covariant Landau-Lifshitz
equation, comparing results of these two approaches and showing smallness of
the third-order Schott term in the ultrarelativistic case. We calculate the
corresponding energy and angular momentum loss of a particle and study the
damping of charged particle oscillations around an equilibrium radius. We find
that depending on the orientation of the Lorentz force, the oscillating charged
particle either spirals down to the black hole, or stabilizes the circular
orbit by decaying its oscillations. The later case leads to an interesting new
result of shifting of the particle orbit outwards from the black hole. We also
discuss the astrophysical relevance of the presented approach and provide

be extended from $\Re(s) > 1$ down to $\Re(s) > \half$, without encountering
any zeros before reaching this critical line. The possibility of doing so can
be traced back to a universal diffusive random walk behavior $C_N = {\cal

$p_n$ where $\chi$ is a Dirichlet character, which underlies the convergence of
the infinite product of the Dirichlet functions. The series $C_N$ presents
several aspects in common with stochastic time series and its control requires
to address a problem similar to the Single Brownian Trajectory Problem in
statistical mechanics. In the case of the Dirichlet functions of non principal
characters, we show that this problem can be solved in terms of a
self-averaging procedure based on an ensemble $\CE$ of block variables computed
on extended intervals of primes. Those intervals, called {\em inertial

algorithm is proven to converge to a utility point arbitrarily close to the
maximum achievable utility within the stability region. Finally, more practical
implementation issues such as distributed scheduling are examined by designing
efficient scheduling algorithms taking advantage of communications diversity.
The proposed distributed solutions utilize mini slots for contention resolution
and achieve a certain fraction of the utility optimal point. The performance
lower bounds for distributed algorithms are determined analytically. The
detailed simulation study is performed to pinpoint the cost of distributed
control for mobile edge networks with respect to centralized control.

energy distribution of a pulsar wind nebula by solving a Fokker-Planck-type

investigate changes in the particle spectrum as they traverse the pulsar wind
nebula, by considering a time and spatially-dependent B-field,
spatially-dependent bulk particle speed implying convection and adiabatic
losses, diffusion, as well as radiative losses. Our code predicts the radiation
spectrum at different positions in the nebula, yielding the surface brightness
versus radius and the nebular size as function of energy. We compare our new
model against more basic models using the observed spectrum of pulsar wind
nebula G0.9+0.1, incorporating data from H.E.S.S. as well as radio and X-ray

change that result in the changing patterns in cropping season, especially for
paddy and coarse grains, pulses roots and Tuber (CGPRT/Palawija) crops. The
cropping patterns of rice and CGPRT crops highly depend on the availability of
rainfall throughout the year. The changing and shifting of the rainy season
result in the changing cropping seasons. It is important to find out the
cropping patterns of paddy and CGPRT crops based on monthly rainfall pattern in
every area. The Oldeman's method which is usually used in the classification of
of cropping patterns of paddy and CGPRT crops is considered less able to
determine the cropping patterns because it requires to see the rainfall data
throughout the year. This research proposes an alternative solution to
determine the cropping pattern of paddy and CGPRT crops based on the pattern of
rainfall in the area using decision tree approach. There were three algorithms,
namely, J48, RandomTree and REPTree, tested to determine the best algorithm
used in the process of the classification of the cropping pattern in the area.
The results showed that J48 algorithm has a higher classification accuracy than
RandomTree and REPTree for 48%, 42.67% and 38.67%, respectively. Meanwhile, the
results of data testing into the decision tree rule indicate that most of the
areas in DKI Jakarta are suggested to apply the cropping pattern of 1 paddy
cropping and 1 CGRPT cropping (1 PS + 1 PL). While in Banten, there are three
cropping patterns that can be applied, they are, 1 paddy cropping and 1 CGPRT
cropping (1 PS + 1 PL), 3 short-period paddy croppings or 2 paddy croppings and
1 CGPRT cropping (3 short-period PS or 2 PS + 1 PL) and 2 paddy croppings and 1

to fuel numerous important applications in computer vision, delivering more
efficiency and convenience than surveillance cameras with fixed camera angle,
scale and view. However, very limited UAV datasets are proposed, and they focus
only on a specific task such as visual tracking or object detection in
relatively constrained scenarios. Consequently, it is of great importance to
develop an unconstrained UAV benchmark to boost related researches. In this
paper, we construct a new UAV benchmark focusing on complex scenarios with new
level challenges. Selected from 10 hours raw videos, about 80,000
representative frames are fully annotated with bounding boxes as well as up to
14 kinds of attributes (e.g., weather condition, flying altitude, camera view,
vehicle category, and occlusion) for three fundamental computer vision tasks:
object detection, single object tracking, and multiple object tracking. Then, a
detailed quantitative study is performed using most recent state-of-the-art
algorithms for each task. Experimental results show that the current
state-of-the-art methods perform relative worse on our dataset, due to the new
challenges appeared in UAV based real scenes, e.g., high density, small object,
and camera motion. To our knowledge, our work is the first time to explore such
issues in unconstrained scenes comprehensively.

amount of energy consumed by main memory of server machines is ever increasing.
Energy consumption of main memory can be greatly reduced by applying
approximate computing in exchange for increased bit error rates. AI and HPC
applications are to some extent robust to bit errors because small numerical
errors are amortized by their iterative nature. However, a single occurrence of
a NaN due to bit-flips corrupts the whole calculation result. The issue is that
fixing every bit-flip using ECC incurs too much overhead because the bit error
rate is much higher than in normal environments. We propose a low-overhead
method to fix NaNs when approximate computing is applied to main memory. The
main idea is to reactively repair NaNs while leaving other non-fatal numerical
errors as-is to reduce the overhead. We implemented a prototype by leveraging
floating-point exceptions of x86 CPUs, and the preliminary evaluations showed
that our method incurs negligible overhead.

features is extracted from two groups of patients with the same type of cancer
but with two medical outcome: 1) survived and 2) passed away. The goal is to
build different models for the two groups, where in each group,
patient-specified behavior of individuals can be characterized. These models
are then used as predictors to forecast future state of patients with a given
history or initial state. To this end, a leave-on-out cross validation method
is used to measure the prediction accuracy of each patient-specified model.
Experiments show that compared to fixed-effect modeling (regression),
mixed-effect modeling has a superior performance on some of the extracted
features and similar or worse performance on the others.

that people have goods and services due to division of labor; the other is the
final state that people have different goods and services with the initial
state due to exchange of goods and services between them. The process is that
the initial state is changed to the final state with the help of money. Because
the direct exchanges of goods and services are difficult to achieve the double
coincidence of wants in time and space, it can be achieved with the help of
money which is as a medium and bridge. In this paper the changing process of

Shajn is the nature of diffuse
matter, its distribu-tion in the Galaxy and extragalactic systems, interaction
with the interstellar medium and hot stars, the formation of emission and
reflection nebulae and stars have become the main theme of researches by Shajn
during some years. Based on the analysis of experimental data, mainly
pho-tographic observations of nebulae in the Milky Way and extragalactic
systems, he made conclu-sions and suggested well-founded hypotheses on a wide
range of the considered problems, in-cluding those related to cosmogony. The
structure of nebulae, their masses and sizes give a reason to the conclusion
that most of them are formed not in the process of ejection of matter from the
stars, but this is the objects, which are born and evolved, and quite often
comprised in giant conglomerates of gas, dust and stars. The distribution of
O-stars and nebulae in spiral branches points to their genetic relation and the
fundamental role of the interstellar medium as a source of their formation. The
structural features of nebulae are determined by the action of
magnetohydrodynamic forces. Magnetic fields in a galaxy control the motion of
diffuse gas-dust matter and ensure the maintenance of its spiral structure.
These ideas continue being developed in modern directions of astrophysics.
