crystal and its polymorphs without any prior experimental information would be
an invaluable tool for a number of fields, with specific and immediate
applications in the design and formulation of pharmaceuticals. In this case,
detailed knowledge of the polymorphic energy landscape for an active
pharmaceutical ingredient yields profound insight regarding the existence and
likelihood of late-appearing polymorphs. However, the computational prediction
of the structures and stabilities of molecular crystal polymorphs is
particularly challenging due to the high dimensionality of conformational and
crystallographic space accompanied by the need for relative (free) energies to
within $\approx$ 1 kJ/mol per molecule. In this work, we combine the most
successful crystal structure sampling strategy with the most accurate energy
ranking strategy of the latest blind test of organic crystal structure
prediction (CSP), organized by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre
(CCDC). Our final energy ranking is based on first-principles density
functional theory (DFT) calculations that include three key physical
contributions: (i) a sophisticated treatment of Pauli exchange-repulsion and
electron correlation effects with hybrid functionals, (ii) inclusion of
many-body van der Waals dispersion interactions, and (iii) account of
vibrational free energies. In doing so, this combined approach has an optimal
success rate in producing the crystal structures corresponding to the five
blind-test molecules. With this practical approach, we demonstrate the
feasibility of obtaining reliable structures and stabilities for molecular
crystals of pharmaceutical importance, paving the way towards an enhanced
fundamental understanding of polymorphic energy landscapes and routine
industrial application of molecular CSP methods.

information (also known as the classical-quantum Slepian-Wolf protocol) in the

the protocol involves compressing classical sequences of finite length $n$ and
decoding them with the assistance of quantum side information. In the large
deviation regime, the compression rate is fixed, and we obtain bounds on the
error exponent function, which characterizes the minimal probability of error
as a function of the rate. Devetak and Winter showed that the asymptotic data
compression limit for this protocol is given by a conditional entropy. For any
protocol with a rate below this quantity, the probability of error converges to
one asymptotically and its speed of convergence is given by the strong converse
exponent function. We obtain finite blocklength bounds on this function, and
determine exactly its asymptotic value. In the moderate deviation regime for
the compression rate, the latter is no longer considered to be fixed. It is
allowed to depend on the blocklength $n$, but assumed to decay slowly to the
asymptotic data compression limit. Starting from a rate above this limit, we
determine the speed of convergence of the error probability to zero and show
that it is given in terms of the conditional information variance. Our results
complement earlier results obtained by Tomamichel and Hayashi, in which they

modern societies. Its migration, especially for developing economies such as
China, plays a strong role in the reallocation of productive resources and
offers a promising proxy for understanding socio-economic issues. Nevertheless,
due to long cycle, expensive cost and coarse granularity, conventional surveys
face challenges in comprehensively profiling it. With the permeation of smart
and mobile devices in recent decades, booming social media has essentially
broken spatio-temporal constraints and enabled the continuous sensing of the
real-time mobility of massive numbers of individuals. In this study, we
demonstrate that similar to a natural shock, the Spring Festival culturally
drives workforce travel between workplaces and hometowns, and the trajectory
footprints from social media therefore open a window with unparalleled richness
and fine granularity to explore laws in national-level workforce migration. To
understand the core driving forces of workforce migration flux between cities
in China, various indicators reflecting the benefits and costs of migration are
introduced into our prediction model. We find that urban GDP (gross domestic
product) and travel time are two excellent indicators to help make predictions.
Diverse migration patterns are then revealed by clustering the trajectories,
which give important clues to help understand the different roles of Chinese
cities in their own development and in regional economic development. These
patterns are further explained as a joint effect of the subjective will to seek
personal benefits and the capacity requirements of local labour markets. Our
study implies that the non-negligible entanglement between social media and
macroeconomic behaviours can be insightful for policymaking in social-economic
issues.

number contrast $c$ from 1 (a knee) to 10 (a divot) provides an acceptable
match to our data. We find that break magnitudes $H_b$ of 7.7 and 8.3, values
both previously suggested for dynamically hot Kuiper belt populations, are
equally non-rejectable for a range of $\alpha_f$ and $c$ in our statistical
analysis. Our preferred divot $H$-distribution transitions to $\alpha_f=0.5$
with a divot of contrast $c=3$ at $H_b=8.3$, while our preferred knee
$H$-distribution transitions to $\alpha_f=0.4$ at $H_b=7.7$. The intrinsic
population of scattering TNOs required to match the OSSOS detections is
$3\times10^6$ for $H_r<12$, and $9\times10^4$ for $H_r<8.66$
($D\gtrsim100$~km), with Centaurs having an intrinsic population two orders of
magnitude smaller.

on trees. Consider an infinite directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a unique
source node $X$. Let the collection of nodes at distance $k$ from $X$ be called
the $k$th layer. At time zero, the source node is given a bit. At time $k\geq
1$, each node in the $(k-1)$th layer inspects its inputs and sends a bit to its
descendants in the $k$th layer. Each bit is flipped with a probability of error
$\delta \in \left(0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$ in the process of transmission. The
goal is to be able to recover the original bit with probability of error better
than $\frac{1}{2}$ from the values of all nodes at an arbitrarily deep layer
$k$.
  Besides its natural broadcast interpretation, the DAG broadcast is a natural
model of noisy computation. Some special cases of the model represent
information flow in biological networks, and other cases represent noisy finite
automata models.
  We show that there exist DAGs with bounded degree and layers of size
$\omega(\log(k))$ that permit recovery provided $\delta$ is sufficiently small
and find the critical $\delta$ for the DAGs constructed. Our result
demonstrates a doubly-exponential advantage for storing a bit in bounded degree
DAGs compared to trees. On the negative side, we show that if the DAG is a
two-dimensional regular grid, then recovery is impossible for any $\delta \in
\left(0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$ provided all nodes use either AND or XOR for their
processing functions.

state estimation where states are represented as nodes, and measurements are
modeled as factors. When designing a sensor fusion framework for legged robots,
one often has access to visual, inertial, joint encoder, and contact sensors.
While visual-inertial odometry has been studied extensively in this framework,
the addition of a preintegrated contact factor for legged robots has been only
recently proposed. This allowed for integration of encoder and contact
measurements into existing factor graphs, however, new nodes had to be added to
the graph every time contact was made or broken. In this work, to cope with the
problem of switching contact frames, we propose a hybrid contact preintegration
theory that allows contact information to be integrated through an arbitrary
number of contact switches. The proposed hybrid modeling approach reduces the
number of required variables in the nonlinear optimization problem by only
requiring new states to be added alongside camera or selected keyframes. This
method is evaluated using real experimental data collected from a Cassie-series
robot where the trajectory of the robot produced by a motion capture system is
used as a proxy for ground truth. The evaluation shows that inclusion of the
proposed preintegrated hybrid contact factor alongside visual-inertial
navigation systems improves estimation accuracy as well as robustness to vision
failure, while its generalization makes it more accessible for legged
platforms.

confirmed this and was able to reproduce the observed spatial distribution of

of vital importance to enable 3D printers to identify the objects to be

performance in the object recognition tasks. However, the lack of large-scale

  This paper presents a new 3D printing image database, namely C3PO, which
compromises two subsets for the different system working scenarios. We extract
images from the numerical control programming code files of 22 3D models, and
then categorize the images into 10 distinct labels. The first set consists of
62,200 images which represent the object projections on the three planes in a
Cartesian coordinate system. And the second sets consists of sequences of total
671,677 images to simulate the cameras' captures of the printed objects.
Importantly, we demonstrate that the weapons can be recognized in either
scenario using deep learning based approaches using our proposed database. % We
also use the trained deep models to build a prototype of object-aware 3D
printer. The quantitative results are promising, and the future exploration of
the database and the crime prevention in 3D printing are demanding tasks.

other penalized maximization problems that require an ""optimal"" penalty tuning

penalty parameters. The proposed heuristic is compared to a large number of
alternative criteria in simulations and an application to gene expression data.
Extensive simulation studies reveal that none of the methods uniformly dominate
the other and highlight the importance of subject-specific knowledge in
choosing statistical methods for dimension learning. Our application results
also suggest that gene expression data have a higher intrinsic dimension than
previously thought. Overall, our proposed heuristic strikes a good balance and
is the method of choice when model assumptions deviated moderately.

systems have become important tools for studying a variety of mesoscopic
physical systems and realizing hybrid quantum systems. While nanomechanics has
been widely applied in solid-state systems, its use in liquid is scantily

fluids offers new opportunities in studying fluids at low excitation levels all
the way down to the quantum limit and in nano-metric scales reaching the fluid
coherence length. Transduction and control of the low-loss excitations also
facilitate long-life quantum information storage. In this work we demonstrate
efficient coupling of a nanomechanical resonator to phonons in a bosonic

that the resonator dynamics is predominately determined by phonon-coupling to

excitation rate of 0.25 phonons per oscillations period are achieved. We
further show that the nanomechanical resonator can strongly couple to
superfluid cavity phonons with cooperativity up to 880. Our study opens up new

collaboration has reported the detection of an absorption feature in the
sky-averaged spectrum at $\approx 78$ MHz. This signal has been interpreted as
the absorption of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons at redshifts $15
\lesssim z \lesssim 20$ by the 21cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen,
whose temperature is expected to be coupled to the gas temperature by the
Wouthuysen-Field effect during this epoch. Because the gas is colder than the
CMB, the 21cm signal is seen in absorption. However, the absorption depth
reported by EDGES is more than twice the maximal value expected in the standard
cosmological model, at $\approx 3.8\sigma$ significance. Here, we propose an
explanation for this depth based on ""early dark energy"" (EDE), a scenario in
which an additional component with equation of state $w=-1$ contributes to the
cosmological energy density at early times, before decaying rapidly at a
critical redshift, $z_c$. For $20 \lesssim z_c \lesssim 1000$, the accelerated
expansion due to the EDE can produce an earlier decoupling of the gas
temperature from the radiation temperature than that in the standard model,
giving the gas additional time to cool adiabatically before the first luminous
sources form. We show that the EDE scenario can successfully explain the large
amplitude of the EDGES signal. However, such models are strongly ruled out by
observations of the CMB temperature power spectrum. Moreover, the EDE models
needed to explain the EDGES signal exacerbate the current tension in low- and
high-redshift measurements of the Hubble constant. We conclude that
non-finely-tuned modifications of the background cosmology are unlikely to
explain the EDGES signal while remaining consistent with other cosmological
observations.

offset goes in the opposite direction to that expected in a scenario where the
hydrostatic method yields a biased, underestimated, mass. We investigated halo
shape parameters such as sparsity and concentration, and compared to local
X-ray selected clusters, finding hints for evolution in the central regions (or
for selection effects). The total baryonic content is in agreement with the
cosmic value at $R_{500}$. Comparison with numerical simulations shows that the
mass distribution and concentration are in line with expectations. These

companion, then the companion will remain in some form after the SN explosion.
Tycho-B is an unusual, relatively hot star along the line of sight to Tycho's
SNR -- conclusively shown to be a Type Ia -- and has been suggested as such a
companion. If the interior of Tycho's SNR contains unshocked Fe, and if Tycho-B
is either within the SNR shell or in the background, then one might hope to see
evidence of this in the UV spectrum. Such is the case for SN\,1006, where
spectra of the background Schweizer-Middleditch star, as well as two AGNs, show
broad absorption lines of Fe II. To test this idea, we have used STIS on HST to
obtain a UV spectrum of Tycho-B. The observed spectrum, however, shows no
evidence of Fe II absorption. Furthermore, a luminosity distance estimate using
UV and optical spectra of Tycho-B suggests that the star is consistent with a
foreground interloper. We conclude either that Tycho B is nearer than Tycho's
SNR, or that all of the Fe in the interior of Tycho's SNR is more highly
ionized.

strong interactions between atoms to be controlled and measured by pulses of
light. Consequently, Rydberg dark polaritons are a promising platform for
quantum simulations. Of particular interest are simulations of one-dimensional
systems, known to exhibit unique properties compared to their
higher-dimensional counterparts. One limitation of standard EIT is that
reducing the polariton group velocity to bring the dark polaritons to rest also
implies activating strong Rydberg interactions. To achieve independent control
of polariton speed and interaction strength, we propose a stationary
light-scheme to bring Rydberg polaritons to a stand-still. This allows them to
remain primarily photonic and, therefore, non-interacting, before Rydberg
interactions are turned on. Once activated, in the dilute regime and in the
presence of strong transverse confinement, the strong polarizabilities of
Rydberg atoms give rise to an effective contact interaction between polaritons.
By tuning the various parameters of the stationary-light scheme, the effective
one-dimensional scattering length may be adjusted to yield various kinds of
physics, including the regime of a Tonks-Girardeau gas, when polaritons exhibit
fermionic behavior. We outline a protocol to observe the resulting spatial

co-exist. We find that the type of solution obtained in this co-existence

severely under-estimate the RP force in the immediate vicinity around
un-resolved (point/discrete) sources (and subsequently under-estimate its
effects on bulk gas properties), unless photon mean-free-paths are
highly-resolved in the fluid grid. The existence of this error is independent
of the numerical radiation transfer (RT) method (even in exact
ray-tracing/Monte-Carlo methods), because it depends on how the RT solution is
interpolated back onto fluid elements. Brute-force convergence (resolving
mean-free paths) is impossible in many cases (especially where UV/ionizing

integrating and applying the momentum fluxes at interfaces between fluid

continuous-variable quantum information processing tasks. To quantitatively
understand non-Gaussianity beyond states, we establish a resource theory for
non-Gaussian operations. In our framework, we consider Gaussian operations as
free operations, and non-Gaussian operations as resources. We define
entanglement-assisted non-Gaussianity generating power and show that it is a
monotone that is non-increasing under the set of free super-operations, i.e.,
concatenation and tensoring with Gaussian channels. For conditional unitary
maps, this monotone can be analytically calculated. As examples, we show that
the non-Gaussianity of ideal photon-number subtraction and photon-number
addition equal the non-Gaussianity of the single-photon Fock state. Based on
our non-Gaussianity monotone, we divide non-Gaussian operations into two
classes: (1) the finite non-Gaussianity class, e.g., photon-number subtraction,
photon-number addition and all Gaussian-dilatable non-Gaussian channels; and
(2) the diverging non-Gaussianity class, e.g., the binary phase-shift channel
and the Kerr nonlinearity. This classification also implies that not all
non-Gaussian channels are exactly Gaussian-dilatable. Our resource theory
enables a quantitative characterization and a first classification of
non-Gaussian operations, paving the way towards the full understanding of
non-Gaussianity.

near-optimal low-complexity distributed RAN slicing algorithms. First, we model

a unique Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, we evaluate the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of

introduce an adaptive pricing mechanism of the wireless resources to improve
the network owner's profit. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms
through simulations and an experimental testbed deployed on the Amazon EC2

the DR1 catalog, BASS provides the largest, least biased sample of local AGN to
date due to its hard X-ray selection (14-195 keV) and rich
multiwavelength/ancillary data. By measuring the projected cross-correlation
function between the AGN and 2MASS galaxies, and interpreting it via halo
occupation distribution (HOD) and subhalo-based models, we constrain the
occupation statistics of the full sample, as well as in bins of absorbing
column density and black hole mass. We find that AGN tend to reside in galaxy
group environments, in agreement with previous studies of AGN throughout a
large range of luminosity and redshift, and that on average they occupy their
dark matter halos similar to inactive galaxies of comparable stellar mass. We
also find evidence that obscured AGN tend to reside in denser environments than
unobscured AGN, even when samples were matched in luminosity, redshift, stellar
mass, and Eddington ratio. We show that this can be explained either by
significantly different halo occupation distributions or statistically
different host halo assembly histories. Lastly, we see that massive black holes
are slightly more likely to reside in central galaxies than black holes of
smaller mass.

However, a closer examination of the sub-luminous $\gamma$-rays and the

Here we present results of 3D and 2D numerical simulations that follow the
hydrodynamics and emission of the outflow from a neutron star merger form its
ejection and up to its deceleration by the circum-merger medium. Our results
show that the entire set of $\gamma$-rays, X-rays and radio observations can be
explained by the emission from a mildly relativistic cocoon material (Lorentz
factor $\sim$2-5) that was formed while a jet propagated through the material
ejected during the merger. The $\gamma$-rays are generated when the cocoon
breaks out from the engulfing ejecta while the afterglow is produced by
interaction of the cocoon matter with the interstellar medium. The strong early
uv/optical signal may be a Lorentz boosted macronova/kilonova. The fate of the
jet itself is currently unknown, but our full-EM models define a path to
resolving between successful and choked jet scenarios, outputting coupled

fluids confined in the gap between a pair of flat plates; whenever the fluid
with lower viscosity displaces the one of higher viscosity the interface is
unstable. For miscible fluids the situation is more complicated due to the
formation of interfacial structure in the thin dimension spanning the gap. Here
we study the effect of the inherent diffusion between the two miscible fluids
on this structure and on the viscous fingering patterns that emerge. We
discover an unexpected transition separating two distinct regimes where the
pattern morphologies and mode of onset are different. This transition is marked
by a regime of transient stability as the structure of the fingers evolves from
having three-dimensional structure to being quasi-two dimensional. The presence
of diffusion allows an instability to form where it was otherwise forbidden.

promising approach for heterogeneous face recognition; enabling existing face
recognition software trained on visible imagery to be leveraged, and allowing
human analysts to verify cross-spectrum matches more effectively. We propose a
new synthesis method to enhance the discriminative quality of synthesized
visible face imagery by leveraging both global (e.g., entire face) and local
regions (e.g., eyes, nose, and mouth). Here, each region provides (1) an
independent representation for the corresponding area, and (2) additional
regularization terms, which impact the overall quality of synthesized images.
We analyze the effects of using multiple regions to synthesize a visible face
image from a thermal face. We demonstrate that our approach improves
cross-spectrum verification rates over recently published synthesis approaches.
Moreover, using our synthesized imagery, we report the results on facial
landmark detection-commonly used for image registration-which is a critical
part of the face recognition process.

of droplets is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. For
experimental analysis, sunflower oil is used as the carrier phase and DI water
as the dispersed phase which is intermixed with Triton X-100 that acts as the
surfactant. A T-junction is used in the microchannel for the purpose of droplet
generation. Presence of an imposed pressure driven flow induces droplet
deformation and disturbs the equilibrium that results in subsequent
surfactant-redistribution along the interface. This further induces a gradient
in the surface tension, thus generating a Marangoni stress that significantly
alters the droplet dynamics. On subsequent experimental investigation, it is
found that presence of surfactants reduces the cross-stream migration velocity
of the droplet. Further, it is shown that the effect of surfactants in reducing
the cross-stream migration is significantly enhanced for a larger droplet as
compared to a smaller one within the same time span, provided the channel
height is kept constant. In addition, a larger surfactant concentration is
found to induce a greater retardation in cross-stream migration of the droplet,
the effect of which is reduced when the initial transverse position of the
droplet is shifted closer to the channel centerline. The present analysis can
be applied to various droplet based microfluidic as well as medical diagnostic
devices where manipulation of droplet trajectory is a major issue. For the
theoretical counterpart, an asymptotic approach is adopted in the presence of
bulk-insoluble surfactants and under the assumption of negligible fluid
inertia. A good match between our theoretical prediction and the experimental
results is obtained.

establish high-throughput low-latency data links in a seamless and
opportunistic manner, as they travel through a dense fog of high-capacity
wireless infrastructure nodes, referred to as remote radio heads (RRHs).
Traditional handover mechanisms in dense multicell networks inherently give
rise to frequent handovers and pilot sequence re-assignments, incurring, as a
result, excessive protocol overhead and significant latency. In the proposed
fog massive MIMO architecture, UEs seamlessly and implicitly associate
themselves to the most convenient RRHs in a completely autonomous manner. Each
UE makes use of a unique uplink pilot sequence, and pilot contamination is
mitigated by a novel coded ""on-the-fly"" pilot contamination control mechanism.
We analyze the spectral efficiency and the outage probability of the proposed
architecture via stochastic geometry, using some recent results on unique
coverage in Boolean models, and provide a detailed comparison with respect to
an idealized baseline massive MIMO cellular system, that neglects protocol
overhead and latency due to explicit user-cell association. Our analysis,
supported by extensive system simulation, reveals that there exists a ""sweet

dynamics in turbulent viscoelastic flows that uses a new geometric
decomposition of the conformation tensor, along with associated scalar measures
of the polymer fluctuations. The approach circumvents an inherent difficulty in
traditional Reynolds decompositions of the conformation tensor: the fluctuating
tensor fields are not positive-definite and so do not retain the physical
meaning of the tensor. The geometric decomposition of the conformation tensor
yields both mean and fluctuating tensor fields that are positive-definite. The
fluctuating tensor in the present decomposition has a clear physical
interpretation as a polymer deformation relative to the mean configuration.
Scalar measures of this fluctuating conformation tensor are developed based on
the non-Euclidean geometry of the set of positive-definite tensors.
Drag-reduced viscoelastic turbulent channel flow is then used an example case
study. The conformation tensor field, obtained using direct numerical
simulations, is analysed using the proposed framework.

studying Majorana zero-modes and demonstrating non-Abelian particle exchange
relevant for topological quantum computing. While evidence for Majorana bound
states in nanowires has been shown, the majority of these experiments are
marked by significant disorder. In particular, the interfacial inhomogeneity
between the superconductor and nanowire is strongly believed to be the main
culprit for disorder and the resulting soft superconducting gap ubiquitous in
tunneling studies of hybrid semiconductor-superconductor systems. Additionally,
a lack of ballistic transport in nanowire systems can create bound states that
mimic Majorana signatures. We resolve these problems through the development of
selective-area epitaxy of Al to InSb nanowires, a technique applicable to other
nanowires and superconductors. Epitaxial InSb-Al devices generically possess a
hard superconducting gap and demonstrate ballistic 1D superconductivity and
near perfect transmission of supercurrents in the single mode regime,
requisites for engineering and controlling 1D topological superconductivity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that epitaxial InSb-Al superconducting island
devices, the building blocks for Majorana based quantum computing applications,
prepared using selective area epitaxy can achieve micron scale ballistic 1D
transport. Our results pave the way for the development of networks of
ballistic superconducting electronics for quantum device applications.

to us is the stability of the M_{tt} and top-quark p_T distributions in the

the choice of dynamic scales. With the help of numeric and analytic arguments
we confirm that the choice for the factorization and renormalization scales

a set of optimized kinematics-dependent scales for the matching functions which
appear in the resummed calculations. Our NNLO+NNLL' prediction for the top-pair
invariant mass is significantly less sensitive to the choice of factorization
scale than the fixed order prediction, even at NNLO. Notably, the resummed and
fixed order calculations are in nearly perfect agreement with each other in the
full M_{tt} range when the optimal dynamic scale is used. For the top-quark p_T
distribution the resummation performed here has less of an impact and instead
we find that upgrading the matching with fixed-order from NLO+NNLL' to
NNLO+NNLL' to be an important effect, a point to be kept in mind when using
NLO-based Monte Carlo event generators to calculate this distribution.

black holes (PBHs) within string inspired single field models of inflation. The
production of PBHs requires a large amplification in the power spectrum of
curvature perturbations between scales associated with CMB and PBH formation.
In principle, this can be achieved by temporarily breaking the slow-roll
conditions during inflation. In this work, we identify two string setups that
can realise this process. In string axion models of inflation, subleading
non-perturbative effects can superimpose steep cliffs and gentle plateaus onto
the leading axion potential. The cliffs can momentarily violate the slow-roll
conditions, and the plateaus can lead to phases of ultra slow-roll inflation.
We thus achieve a string motivated model which both matches the Planck
observations at CMB scales and produces a population of light PBHs, which can
account for an order one fraction of dark matter. In DBI models of inflation, a
sharp increase in the speed of sound sourced by a steep downward step in the
warp factor can drive the amplification. In this scenario, discovery of PBHs
could indicate non-trivial dynamics in the bulk, such as flux-antibrane
annihilation at the tip of a warped throat.

ratios of nuclei to $^3$He in the 3N-SRC region to the same ratio measured in

of instruments used to study the Cosmic Microwave Background are important
factors in the data-to-map analysis pipeline. If not properly characterized,
they could limit the ability of next-generation experiments to remove
astrophysical foreground contamination. Uncertainties include the instrument
detector band, which could systematically change across the focal plane, as
well as the calibration of the instrument used to measure the bands. A
potentially major effect is time-dependent gain and band uncertainties caused
by atmospheric fluctuations. More specifically, changes in atmospheric
conditions lead to frequency-dependent changes in the atmospheric transmission
which, in turn, leads to variations in the effective gain and central frequency
of the instrument's bandpass. Using atmospheric modeling software and ACTPol
bandpasses, we simulate the expected variations in band gain and central
frequency for 20, 40, 90, 150, and 240 GHz bands as a function of precipitable
water vapor, observing angle, and ground temperature. Combining these effects
enables us to set maximum and minimum limits on the expected uncertainties in
band gain and central frequency over the course of a full observing season. We
then introduce the uncertainties to parametric maximum-likelihood component
separation methods on simulated CMB maps to forecast foreground removal
performance and likelihoods on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. We conclude that
to measure a $\sigma(r=0)$ ~ $10^{-3}$ with a bias on the recovered $r$ under
control, the limit on the uncertainty in the relative gain and central
frequency of the bandpass must be <2% and <1%, respectively. We also comment on

domains are presently engineered to solve a particular task, and cannot easily
handle variations in the product or environment. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
a promising approach for autonomously acquiring robot skills that involve
contact-rich dynamics. However, RL relies on random exploration for learning a
control policy, which requires many robot executions, and often gets trapped in
locally suboptimal solutions. Instead, we posit that prior knowledge, when
available, can improve RL performance. We exploit the fact that in modern
assembly domains, geometric information about the task is readily available via
the CAD design files. We propose to leverage this prior knowledge by guiding RL
along a geometric motion plan, calculated using the CAD data. We show that our
approach effectively improves over traditional control approaches for tracking
the motion plan, and can solve assembly tasks that require high precision, even
without accurate state estimation. In addition, we propose a neural network
architecture that can learn to track the motion plan, and generalize the

In particular, for several post-common-envelope binaries (PCEBs) that consist
of a white dwarf and a main sequence star, the O-C diagram suggests that real
or apparent orbital period variations are driven by Jupiter-mass planets or as
a result of magnetic activity, the so-called Applegate mechanism. The latter
explains orbital period variations as a result of changes in the stellar
quadrupole moment due to magnetic activity. We explore the feasibility of
driving ETVs via the Applegate mechanism for a sample of PCEB systems,
including a range of different rotations. Using the MESA code we evolve 12
stars with different masses and rotation rates. We apply a simple dynamo model
to their radial profiles to investigate on which scale the predicted activity
cycle matches the observed modulation period, and quantify the uncertainty, and
further calculate the required energies to drive que Applegate mechanism. We
show that the Applegate mechanism is energetically feasible in 5 PCEB systems,
and note that these are the systems with the highest rotation rate compared to
the critical rotation rate of the main-sequence star. The results suggest that
the ratio of physical to critical rotation in the main sequence star is an
important indicator for the feasibility of Applegate's mechanism, but exploring
larger samples will be necessary to probe this hypothesis.

study of exoplanets during the last two decades, from the early discovery of

by transit surveys. While optical radial-velocity is now a mature field, there
is currently a strong effort to push the technique into the near-infrared (nIR)
domain (chiefly $Y$, $J$, $H$ and $K$ band passes) to probe planetary systems
around late-type stars. The combined lower mass and luminosity of M dwarfs
leads to an increased reflex RV signal for planets in the habitable zone
compared to Sun-like stars. The estimates on the detectability of planets rely
on various instrumental characteristics, but also on a prior knowledge of the
stellar spectrum. While the overall properties of M dwarf spectra have been
extensively tested against observations, the same is not true for their
detailed line profiles, which leads to significant uncertainties when
converting a given signal-to-noise ratio to a corresponding RV precision as
attainable on a given spectrograph. By combining archival CRIRES and HARPS data

information from several data sources and produces a `severity' score for the
vulnerability. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (\CVSS) is the reference
standard for this assessment. Yet, no guidance currently exists on \emph{which

  In this paper we address this problem by evaluating which information cues
increase (or decrease) assessment accuracy.
  We devise a block design experiment with 67 software engineering students
with varying vulnerability information and measure scoring accuracy under
different information sets.
  We find that baseline vulnerability descriptions provided by standard
vulnerability sources provide only part of the information needed to achieve an
accurate vulnerability assessment. Further, we find that additional information
on \texttt{assets}, \texttt{attacks}, and \texttt{vulnerability type}
contributes in increasing the accuracy of the assessment; conversely,
information on \texttt{known threats} misleads the assessor and decreases
assessment accuracy and should be avoided when assessing vulnerabilities. These
results go in the direction of formalizing the vulnerability communication to,
for example, fully automate security assessments.

resilience to isolated shocks, gradual parameter changes, and continuous noise,
quantifying resilience to repeated, discrete disturbances requires novel
analytical tools. Here we introduce a flow-kick framework that quantifies
resilience to disturbances explicitly in terms of their magnitude and
frequency. We present a resilience boundary between disturbances that cause
either escape from a basin of attraction or stabilization within it, and use
the resilience boundary to build resilience metrics tailored to repeated,
discrete disturbances. The flow-kick model suggests that the
distance-to-threshold resilience metric overestimates resilience in the context
of repeated disturbances. It also reveals counterintuitive triggers for regime
shifts, such as increasing recovery times between disturbances, or increasing
disturbance magnitude and recovery times proportionately.

scheme for linear time-invariant constrained systems which admit a separable
structure. To exploit the merits of distributed computation algorithms, the
stabilizing terminal controller, value function and invariant terminal set of
the DMPC optimization problem need to respect the loosely coupled structure of
the system. Although existing methods in the literature address this task, they
typically decouple the synthesis of terminal controllers and value functions
from the one of terminal sets. In addition, these approaches do not explicitly
consider the effect of the current state of the system in the synthesis
process. These limitations can lead the resulting DMPC scheme to poor
performance since it may admit small or even empty terminal sets. Unlike other
approaches, this paper presents a unified framework to encapsulate the
synthesis of both the stabilizing terminal controller and invariant terminal
set into the DMPC formulation. Conditions for Lyapunov stability and invariance
are imposed in the synthesis problem in a way that allows the value function
and invariant terminal set to admit the desired distributed structure. We
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several examples

  highly-correlated designs",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sparse models for high-dimensional linear regression and machine learning
have received substantial attention over the past two decades. Model selection,
or determining which features or covariates are the best explanatory variables,
is critical to the interpretability of a learned model. Much of the current
literature assumes that covariates are only mildly correlated. However, in many
modern applications covariates are highly correlated and do not exhibit key
properties (such as the restricted eigenvalue condition, restricted isometry
property, or other related assumptions). This work considers a high-dimensional
regression setting in which a graph governs both correlations among the
covariates and the similarity among regression coefficients -- meaning there is
\emph{alignment} between the covariates and regression coefficients. Using side
information about the strength of correlations among features, we form a graph
with edge weights corresponding to pairwise covariances. This graph is used to
define a graph total variation regularizer that promotes similar weights for
correlated features.
  This work shows how the proposed graph-based regularization yields
mean-squared error guarantees for a broad range of covariance graph structures.
These guarantees are optimal for many specific covariance graphs, including
block and lattice graphs. Our proposed approach outperforms other methods for
highly-correlated design in a variety of experiments on synthetic data and real
biochemistry data.

method in regulating the operation of large-scale networks of constrained
dynamical systems. This paper is concerned with cooperative distributed MPC in
which the decision actions of the systems are usually derived by the solution
of a system-wide optimization problem. However, formulating and solving such
large-scale optimization problems is often a hard task which requires extensive
information communication among the individual systems and fails to address
privacy concerns in the network. Hence, the main challenge is to design
decision policies with a prescribed structure so that the resulting system-wide
optimization problem to admit a loosely coupled structure and be amendable to
distributed computation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a decentralized
problem synthesis scheme which only requires each system to communicate sets
which bound its states evolution to neighboring systems. The proposed method
alleviates concerns on privacy since this limited communication scheme does not
reveal the exact characteristics of the dynamics within each system. In
addition, it enables a distributed computation of the solution, making our
method highly scalable. We demonstrate in a number of numerical studies,
inspired by engineering and finance, the efficacy of the proposed approach
which leads to solutions that closely approximate those obtained by the
centralized formulation only at a fraction of the computational effort.

spectrum shows a power law decay extending up to the gravity capillary
crossover (14 Hz) with a spectral exponent that is increasing with the forcing
strength and decaying with surface contamination. Although slightly higher than
reported previously in the literature, the exponent for the cleanest water
remains significantly below the prediction from the Weak Turbulence Theory. By
discussing length and time scales, we show that weak turbulence cannot be
expected at frequencies above 3 Hz. We observe with a stereoscopic
reconstruction technique that the increase with the forcing strength of energy
spectrum beyond 3~Hz is mostly due to the formation and strenghtening of bound
waves.

strongly bound excitons that are interesting for applications in the

efficient generation and detection schemes in this spectral range. Here, we
perform ultrafast broadband deep-ultraviolet spectroscopy on anatase TiO$_2$
single crystals at room temperature, and reveal a dramatic modulation of the
exciton peak amplitude due to coherent acoustic phonons. This modulation is
comparable to those of nanostructures where exciton-phonon coupling is enhanced
by quantum confinement, and is accompanied by a giant exciton shift of 30-50
meV. We model these results by many-body perturbation theory and show that the
deformation potential coupling within the nonlinear regime is the main
mechanism for the generation and detection of the coherent acoustic phonons.
Our findings pave the way to the design of exciton control schemes in the

the evaluation of a collection of spatial boundary integral operators with

asymptotic approximation with the evaluation of a few boundary integral
operators involving only Gaussian kernels, which are easily accelerated by a
new version of the fast Gauss transform. This new scheme is robust, avoids
geometrically-induced stiffness, and is easy to use in the presence of moving

insulator (TI) harbor Majorana bound states (MBS's) among a continuum of
conventional Andreev bound states. The distinct feature of these MBS's lies in
the $4\pi$-periodicity of their energy-phase relation that yields a fractional
ac Josephson effect and a suppression of odd Shapiro steps under $r\!f$
irradiation. Yet, recent experiments showed that a few, or only the first, odd
Shapiro steps are missing, casting doubts on the interpretation. Here, we show
that Josephson junctions tailored on the large bandgap 3D TI Bi$_2$Se$_3$
exhibit a fractional ac Josephson effect acting on the first Shapiro step only.
With a modified resistively shunted junction model, we demonstrate that the
resilience of higher order odd Shapiro steps can be accounted for by thermal
poisoning driven by Joule overheating. Furthermore, we uncover a residual
supercurrent at the nodes between Shapiro lobes, which provides a direct and
novel signature of the current carried by the MBS. Our findings showcase the
crucial role of thermal effects in topological Josephson junctions and lend
support to the Majorana origin of the partial suppression of odd Shapiro steps.

landmarks and their displacement are first estimated from a pair of US images
using corresponding local image features. Subsequently, a Gaussian Process (GP)

on the image context and visualization of the uncertainty measure provided by
the GP to further improve the result. We retrospectively demonstrate our

conditions for attainment of the optimal value, such as coercivity of the
objective function and closedness and boundedness of the feasible set, is
strongly NP-hard. As a byproduct, our proofs imply that testing the Archimedean

detected for the first time by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, in event GW170817.
This detection placed an upper limit on the effective tidal deformability of
the two neutron stars and tightly constrained the chirp mass of the system. We
report here on a new simplification that arises in the effective tidal
deformability of the binary, when the chirp mass is specified. We find that, in
this case, the effective tidal deformability of the binary is surprisingly
independent of the component masses of the individual neutron stars, and
instead depends primarily on the ratio of the chirp mass to the neutron star
radius. Thus, a measurement of the effective tidal deformability can be used to
directly measure the neutron star radius. We find that the upper limit on the
effective tidal deformability from GW170817 implies that the radius cannot be
larger than ~13km, at the 90% level, independent of the assumed masses for the
component stars. The result can be applied generally, to probe the stellar
radii in any neutron star-neutron star merger with a measured chirp mass. The
approximate mass-independence disappears for neutron star-black hole mergers.
Finally, we discuss a Bayesian inference of the equation of state that uses the
measured chirp mass and tidal deformability from GW170817 combined with nuclear
and astrophysical priors and discuss possible statistical biases in this
inference.

ubiquitous at persistently active andesitic and dacitic subduction zone
volcanoes. They provide critical information regarding the state of volcanic
unrest, and their occurrence rates are key data for eruption forecasting. LPs
are commonly quasi-periodic or 'anti-clustered', unlike volcano-tectonic (VT)
earthquakes, so the existing Poisson point process methods used to model
occurrence rates of VT earthquakes are unlikely to be optimal for LP data. We
evaluate the performance of candidate formulations for LP data, based on
inhomogeneous point process models with four different inter-event time
distributions: exponential (IP), Gamma (IG), inverse Gaussian (IIG), and
Weibull (IW). We examine how well these models explain the observed data, and
the quality of retrospective forecasts of eruption time. We use a Bayesian MCMC
approach to fit the models. Goodness-of-fit is assessed using Quantile-Quantile
and Kolmogorov-Smirnov methods, and benchmarking against results obtained from
synthetic datasets. IG and IIG models were both found to fit the data well,
with the IIG model slightly outperforming the IG model. Retrospective
forecasting analysis shows that the IG model performs best, with the initial
preference for the IIG model controlled by catalogue incompleteness late in the
sequence. The IG model fits the data significantly better than the IP model,
and simulations show it produces better forecasts for highly periodic data.
Simulations also show that forecast precision increases with the degree of
periodicity of the earthquake process using the IG model, and so should be
better for LP earthquakes than VTs. These results provide a new framework for
point process modelling of volcanic earthquake time series, and verification of
alternative models.

Leeuwaarden (SIGMETRICS '17, arXiv:1703.08373), which offers an efficient
scalable implementation and yet achieves asymptotically optimal steady-state
delay performance and energy consumption as the number of servers $N\to\infty$.
In the above work, the asymptotic results are obtained under the assumption
that the queues have fixed-size finite buffers, and therefore the fundamental
question of stability of the proposed scheme with infinite buffers was left
open. In this paper, we address this fundamental stability question. The system
stability under the usual subcritical load assumption is not automatic.
Moreover, the stability may not even hold for all $N$. The key challenge stems
from the fact that the process lacks monotonicity, which has been the powerful
primary tool for establishing stability in load balancing models. We develop a
novel method to prove that the subcritically loaded system is stable for large
enough $N$, and establish convergence of steady-state distributions to the
optimal one, as $N \to \infty$. The method goes beyond the state of the art
techniques -- it uses an induction-based idea and a ""weak monotonicity""
property of the model; this technique is of independent interest and may have
broader applicability.

IMRPhenomD and SEOBNRv4 recover only $\sim70\%$ of injections with fitting
factor (FF) higher than 0.97 (or 90\% of injections with ${\rm FF}
>0.9$).However, using the sky-maxed statistic, IMRPhenomPv2 performs
magnificently better than their non-precessing counterparts with recovering
$99\%$ of the injections with FFs higher than 0.97. Interestingly, injections
with $\Delta \phi = 180^{\circ}$ have higher FFs ($\Delta \phi$ is the angle
between the components of the black hole spins in the plane orthogonal to the
orbital angular momentum) as compared to their $\Delta \phi =0^{\circ}$ and
generic counterparts. This implies that we will have a slight observation bias
towards $\Delta \phi=180^{\circ}$ SORs while using non-precessing templates for
searches. All template approximants are able to recover most of the injected NR
waveforms with FFs $>0.95$. For all the injections including NR, the error in
estimating chirp mass remains below $<10\%$ with minimum error for $\Delta \phi
= 180^{\circ}$ resonant binaries. The symmetric mass ratio can be estimated
with errors below $15\%$. The effective spin parameter $\chi_{\rm eff}$ is
measured with maximum absolute error of 0.13. The in-plane spin parameter
$\chi_p$ is mostly underestimated indicating that a precessing signal will be
recovered as a relatively less precessing signal. Based on our findings, we
conclude that we not only need improvements in waveform models towards

The objective function is assumed to be a weighted sum of features (or basis

trajectory of system states and inputs. The proposed technique introduces the
concept of the recovery matrix to establish the relationship between any
available segment of the trajectory and the weights of given candidate
features. The rank of the recovery matrix indicates whether a subset of
relevant features can be found among the candidate features and the
corresponding weights can be learned from the segment data. The recovery matrix
can be obtained iteratively and its rank non-decreasing property shows that
additional observations may contribute to the objective learning. Based on the
recovery matrix, a method for using incomplete trajectory observations to learn
the weights of selected features is established, and an incremental inverse
optimal control algorithm is developed by automatically finding the minimal
required observation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated
on a linear quadratic regulator system and a simulated robot manipulator.

analyze the role of secondary motions on the mean flow structure. For that

Kasagi (FIK), which allows to quantify the effect of cross-stream convection on
the mean streamwise velocity, wall shear stress and bulk friction coefficient.
Secondary motions are found to contribute for about $6\%$ of total friction,
and to act as a self-regulating mechanism of turbulence whereby wall shear
stress nonuniformities induced by corners are equalized, and universality of
the wall-normal velocity profiles is established. We also carry out numerical
experiments whereby the secondary motions are artificially suppressed, in which
case their equalizing role is partially taken by the turbulent stresses.

problem of maximizing the return time entropy of a Markov chain, subject to a
graph topology with travel times and stationary distribution. The return time
entropy is the weighted average, over all graph nodes, of the entropy of the
first return times of the Markov chain; this objective function is a function
series that does not admit in general a closed form.
  The paper features theoretical and computational contributions. First, we
obtain a discrete-time delayed linear system for the return time probability
distribution and establish its convergence properties. We show that the
objective function is continuous over a compact set and therefore admits a
global maximum; a unique globally-optimal solution is known only for complete
graphs with unitary travel times. We then establish upper and lower bounds
between the return time entropy and the well-known entropy rate of the Markov
chain. To compute the optimal Markov chain numerically, we establish the
asymptotic equality between entropy, conditional entropy and truncated entropy,
and propose an iteration to compute the gradient of the truncated entropy.
Finally, we apply these results to the robotic surveillance problem. Our
numerical results show that, for a model of rational intruder over prototypical
graph topologies and test cases, the maximum return time entropy chain performs
better than several existing Markov chains.

it is computationally convenient to represent the stretched exponential
function as a Prony series of simple exponentials. Here, we perform a
comprehensive mathematical analysis of the Prony series approximation of the
stretched exponential relaxation, including optimized coefficients for certain

However, it is unable to capture the divergence of the first-derivative of the

approximately related to the survival probability at rest $\mathcal{P}_0(t)$ by

surface, and the interior. Such theories have been used to cast doubt on the
habitability of ocean worlds. However, Levi et al (2017) have recently proposed
a mechanism by which CO2 is mobilized between the atmosphere and the interior
of an ocean world. At high enough CO2 pressures, sea ice can become enriched in
CO2 clathrates and sink after a threshold density is achieved. The presence of
subpolar sea ice is of great importance for habitability in ocean worlds. It
may moderate the climate and is fundamental in current theories of life
formation in diluted environments. Here, we model the Levi et al. mechanism and
use latitudinally-dependent non-grey energy balance and single-column
radiative-convective climate models and find that this mechanism may be
sustained on ocean worlds that rotate at least 3 times faster than the Earth.
We calculate the circumstellar region in which this cycle may operate for
G-M-stars (Teff = 2,600 to 5,800 K), extending from about 1.23 to 1.65, 0.69 to
0.954, 0.38 to 0.528 AU, 0.219 to 0.308 AU, 0.146 to 0.206 AU, and 0.0428 to
0.0617 AU for G2, K2, M0, M3, M5, and M8 stars, respectively. However, unless
planets are very young and not tidally locked, our mechanism would be unlikely
to apply to stars cooler than a ~M3. We predict C/O ratios for our atmospheres
(about 0.5) that can be verified by the JWST mission.

valuable informations about the macroscopical features of compact astrophysical
objects as neutron stars. They are sensitive to both the equation of state
considered for nuclear matter and the background gravitational theory. In this
work we construct the TOV equation for a conservative version of the $f(R,T)$
gravity. While the non-vanishing of the covariant derivative of the $f(R,T)$
energy-momentum tensor yields, in a cosmological perspective, the prediction of
creation of matter throughout the universe evolution as shown by T. Harko, in
the analysis of the hydrostatic equilibrium of compact astrophysical objects,
this property still lacks a convincing physical explanation. The imposition of
$\nabla^{\mu}T_{\mu\nu}=0$ demands a particular form for the function $h(T)$ in
$f(R,T)=R+h(T)$, which is here derived. Therefore, the choice of a specific
equation of state for the star matter demands a unique form of $h(T)$,
manifesting a strong connection between conserved $f(R,T)$ gravity and the star
matter constitution. We construct and solve the TOV equation for the general
equation of state for $p=k\rho^{\Gamma}$, with $k$ being the EoS parameter,
$\rho$ {\it the energy density} and $\Gamma$ is the adiabatic index. We also

improve space efficiency. Traditional deduplication research ignores the design
specifications of shared-nothing distributed storage systems such as no central

deduplication introduces transactional changes, which are prone to errors in
the event of a system failure, resulting in inconsistencies in data and
deduplication metadata. In this paper, we propose a robust, fault-tolerant and
scalable cluster-wide deduplication that can eliminate duplicate copies across
the cluster. We design a distributed deduplication metadata shard which
guarantees performance scalability while preserving the design constraints of
shared- nothing storage systems. The placement of chunks and deduplication
metadata is made cluster-wide based on the content fingerprint of chunks. To
ensure transactional consistency and garbage identification, we employ a
flag-based asynchronous consistency mechanism. We implement the proposed
deduplication on Ceph. The evaluation shows high disk-space savings with
minimal performance degradation as well as high robustness in the event of
sudden server failure.

semantic feature learning, i.e., learning without requiring manual annotation
effort, is of crucial importance in order to successfully harvest the vast

image features by training ConvNets to recognize the 2d rotation that is
applied to the image that it gets as input. We demonstrate both qualitatively
and quantitatively that this apparently simple task actually provides a very
powerful supervisory signal for semantic feature learning. We exhaustively
evaluate our method in various unsupervised feature learning benchmarks and we
exhibit in all of them state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, our results

0.254 $\pm$ 0.008). Their current metallicity ([Fe/H]=$-0.275 \pm 0.04$ and
$-0.285 \pm 0.04$) is also the same within errors. Fits to the signature of the
He{\sc ii} acoustic glitch yields current helium abundances of $Y_{\rm A} =
0.224 \pm 0.006$ and $Y_{\rm B} = 0.233 \pm 0.008$ for the two components.
Analyzing the complete ensemble of models generated for this investigation we
find that both the amplitude and acoustic depth of the glitch signature arising
from the second helium ionization zone and the base of the convection zone (CZ)
are functions of mass. We show that the acoustic depths of these glitches are
positively correlated with each other. The analysis can help us to detect the
internal structure and constrain the chemical compositions.

challenges is to detect small, blurred and partially occluded faces in
uncontrolled environment. This paper proposes a novel context-assisted single
shot face detector, named \emph{PyramidBox} to handle the hard face detection
problem. Observing the importance of the context, we improve the utilization of
contextual information in the following three aspects. First, we design a novel
context anchor to supervise high-level contextual feature learning by a
semi-supervised method, which we call it PyramidAnchors. Second, we propose the
Low-level Feature Pyramid Network to combine adequate high-level context
semantic feature and Low-level facial feature together, which also allows the
PyramidBox to predict faces of all scales in a single shot. Third, we introduce
a context-sensitive structure to increase the capacity of prediction network to
improve the final accuracy of output. In addition, we use the method of
Data-anchor-sampling to augment the training samples across different scales,
which increases the diversity of training data for smaller faces. By exploiting
the value of context, PyramidBox achieves superior performance among the
state-of-the-art over the two common face detection benchmarks, FDDB and WIDER
FACE. Our code is available in PaddlePaddle:

emotion recognition, in which global acoustic features of an utterance are
mostly used to eliminate the content differences. However, the expression of
speech emotion is a dynamic process, which is reflected through dynamic
durations, energies, and some other prosodic information when one speaks. In
this paper, a novel local dynamic pitch probability distribution feature, which
is obtained by drawing the histogram, is proposed to improve the accuracy of
speech emotion recognition. Compared with most of the previous works using
global features, the proposed method takes advantage of the local dynamic
information conveyed by the emotional speech. Several experiments on Berlin
Database of Emotional Speech are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the local dynamic

emotion recognition than the traditional global features.

i.e., they prefer to categorize objects based on their shape rather than color.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are also designed to take into account the
spatial structure of image data. In fact, experiments on image datasets,
consisting of triples of a probe image, a shape-match and a color-match, have
shown that one-shot learning models display shape bias as well.
  In this paper, we examine the shape bias property of CNNs. In order to
conduct large scale experiments, we propose using the model accuracy on images
with reversed brightness as a metric to evaluate the shape bias property. Such
images, called negative images, contain objects that have the same shape as
original images, but with different colors. Through extensive systematic
experiments, we investigate the role of different factors, such as training
data, model architecture, initialization and regularization techniques, on the
shape bias property of CNNs. We show that it is possible to design different
CNNs that achieve similar accuracy on original images, but perform
significantly different on negative images, suggesting that CNNs do not
intrinsically display shape bias. We then show that CNNs are able to learn and
generalize the structures, when the model is properly initialized or data is
properly augmented, and if batch normalization is used.

substantially accelerate segmentation on video, achieving near real-time frame

compact galaxy which could be observed as a 'red nugget' in the high-z
universe. This scenario contrasts with existing S0 formation scenarios in the
literature in two important ways. First, the progenitor is an elliptical galaxy
whereas scenarios in the literature typically assume a spiral progenitor.
Second, the physical conditions underlying our proposed scenario can exist in
low-density environments such as the field, in contrast to scenarios in the
literature which typically address dense environments like clusters and groups.
As a consequence, S0s in the field may be the most likely candidates to have
evolved from elliptical progenitors. Our scenario also naturally explains
recent observations which indicate that field S0s may have older bulges than
discs, contrary to cluster S0s which seem to have older discs than bulges.

approaches $50\%$ from above. %This provides another scenario in which weakly

estimator to identify the dynamics of the system with only a limited number of
input-state data samples. We characterize the properties of this estimator
under high-dimensional scaling, where the growth rate of the system dimension
is comparable to or even faster than that of the number of available sample
trajectories. In particular, using contemporary results on high-dimensional
statistics, we show that the proposed estimator results in a small element-wise
error, provided that the number of sample trajectories is above a threshold.
This threshold depends polynomially on the size of each block and the number of
nonzero elements at different rows of input and state matrices, but only
logarithmically on the system dimension. A by-product of this result is that
the number of sample trajectories required for sparse system identification is
significantly smaller than the dimension of the system. Furthermore, we show
that, unlike the recently celebrated least-squares estimators for system
identification problems, the method developed in this work is capable of
\textit{exact recovery} of the underlying sparsity structure of the system with

V4: Updated figures/text/appendices",,,,"physics.ins-det gr-qc hep-ex hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The mass of axion dark matter is only weakly bounded by cosmological
observations, necessitating a variety of detection techniques over several
orders of magnitude of mass ranges. Axions haloscopes based on resonant
cavities have become the current standard to search for dark matter axions.
Such structures are inherently narrowband and for low masses the volume of the
required cavity becomes prohibitively large. Broadband low-mass detectors have
already been proposed using inductive magnetometer sensors and a gapped
toroidal solenoid magnet. In this work we propose an alternative, which uses
electric sensors in a conventional solenoidal magnet aligned in the laboratory
z-axis, as implemented in standard haloscope experiments. In the presence of
the DC magnetic field, the inverse Primakoff effect causes a time varying
permanent electric vacuum polarization in the z-direction to oscillate at the
axion Compton frequency, which induces an oscillating electromotive force. We
propose non-resonant techniques to detect this oscillating elctromotive force
by implementing a capacitive sensor or an electric dipole antenna coupled to a
low noise amplifier. We present the first experimental results and discuss the
foundations and potential of this proposal. Preliminary results constrain
$g_{a\gamma\gamma} >\sim2.35\times10^{-12}$ $\text{GeV}^{-1}$ in the mass range
of $2.08\times10^{-11}$ to $2.2\times10^{-11}$ eV, and demonstrate potential
sensitivity to axion-like dark matter with masses in the range of $10^{-12}$ to
$10^{-8}$ eV.

$n$ dimensional $C^{\infty}$ Riemannian manifold $M$, that is, $u$ satisfies
the equation $\triangle_M^2u=0$ on $M$, where $\triangle_M$ is the Laplacian
operator on $M$. We first define the frequency function and the doubling index
for the bi-harmonic function $u$, and then establish their monotonicity
formulae and doubling conditions. With the help of the smallness propagation

small enough, an upper bound for the measure of nodal set of the bi-harmonic

\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\left(\left\{x\in B_{r/2}(x_0)|u(x)=0\right\}\right)\leq

about 11 years have been observed over the last four decades. The period of
these torsional oscillations and their latitudinal propagation roughly
coincides with the period and equatorward propagation of sunspots which
originate from a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo mechanism operating in the Suns
interior. While the solar differential rotation plays an important role in this
dynamo mechanism by inducting the toroidal component of magnetic field, the
impact of torsional oscillations on the dynamo mechanism and hence the solar
cycle is not well understood. Here, we include the observed torsional
oscillations into a flux transport dynamo model of the solar cycle to
investigate their effect. We find that the overall amplitude of the solar cycle
does not change significantly on inclusion of torsional oscillations. However,
all the characteristics of the Waldmeier effect in the sunspot cycle are
qualitatively reproduced by varying only the amplitude of torsional
oscillations. The Waldmeier effect, first noted in 1935, includes the important
characteristic that the amplitude of sunspot cycles is anti-correlated to their
rise time; cycles with high initial rise rate tend to be stronger. This has
implications for solar cycle predictions. Our results suggest that the
Waldmeier effect could be a plausible outcome of cycle to cycle modulation of
torsional oscillations and provides a physical basis for sunspot cycle
forecasts based on torsional oscillation observations. We also provide a
theoretical explanation based on the magnetic induction equation thereby
connecting two apparently disparate phenomena.

useful for building tools and techniques pertaining to several automated

  In order to achieve our goal, we first extract coding style information (e.g.
related to programming language constructs used in the source code) for source
code files present on GitHub. Then the information available in bug reports (if
any) associated with these source code files are extracted. Thus fetched un(/

languages (viz., C, C++, Java, and Python) and belong to different types of
applications.
  A machine learning (ML) model for estimating the defectiveness of a given

the best ML model, we evaluated 8 different ML algorithms such as Random
Forest, K Nearest Neighbour and SVM with around 50 parameter configurations to
compare their performance on our tasks. One of our findings shows that best

the mechanisms and functional significance of these spatial representations

Naturally, they can fulfill such promises only if they have been recorded
accurately. That is why we start this study by listing a number of pitfalls
that may occur in the process of taking censuses. In this paper our main goal
is to show how it is possible to ""read"" population pyramids. Sudden changes in
birth rate give rise to the clearest signatures. This indicator reveals that
major tragedies like famines, wars, or epidemics are generally accompanied by a
fall in birth rates. Thanks to this observation, population pyramids can be
used to identify and gauge the blows suffered by populations and nations. As an
illustration of how this works, we compare the population pyramids of North and
South Korea. This allows us, among other things, to gauge the scale of the food

gaze-assisted user authentication system as a potential solution to counter
shoulder-surfing attacks. The system comprises of an eye tracker and an
authentication interface with 12 pre-defined shapes (e.g., triangle, circle,
etc.) that move simultaneously on the screen. A user chooses a set of three
shapes as a password. To authenticate, the user follows the paths of three
shapes as they move, one on each frame, over three consecutive frames.
  The system uses either the template matching or decision tree algorithms to
match the scan-path of the user's gaze with the path traversed by the shape.
The system was evaluated with seven users to test the accuracy of both the
algorithms. We found that with the template matching algorithm the system
achieves an accuracy of 95%, and with the decision tree algorithm an accuracy
of 90.2%. We also present the advantages and disadvantages of using both the

overestimated and their energy dependence was not described well in the
measured energy range, this is not the case for the reactions studied here. The
result is consistent with the proposal that additional reaction channels, such
as Coulomb excitation, may have led to the discrepancies found in other
reactions.

generalize symplectic model reduction to allow for the norms and inner products

accelerate the evaluation of nonlinear terms, a greedy generation of a

used and the domain adaptation is applied, an absolute increase of around 10\%

covert communications aided by a full-duplex receiver. Specifically, the
transmitter varies the power and phase of transmitted signals as per the
channel to the receiver, such that the receiver can decode these signals
without knowing the channel state information. This eliminates the required
feedback from the transmitter to the receiver, which aids hiding the
transmitter from a warden. The truncated CIPC and conventional CIPC schemes are
proposed and examined, where for truncated CIPC covert transmission ceases when
the channel quality from the transmitter to the receiver is low, while for
conventional CIPC covert transmission always occurs regardless of this channel
quality. We examine their performance in terms of the achieved effective covert
throughput (ECT), which quantifies the amount of information that the
transmitter can reliably convey to the receiver, subject to the constraint that
the warden's detection error probability is no less than some specific value.
Our examination shows that the truncated CIPC scheme can outperform the
conventional CIPC scheme due to this constraint.

overcome energy barriers leading to adsorption and desorption with each other

leads to a transition from the secondary to the primary minimum of the DLVO

architectures. We use the freedom of design by 3D-printing spinnerets, having
multiple bore channels of any geometry. First, such spinnerets are stationary
to fabricate straight bore channels inside a monolithic membrane. Second, in an
even more complex design, a new mechanical system enables rotating the
spinneret. Such rotating multibore spinnerets enable (A) the preparation of
twisted channels inside a porous monolithic membrane as well as (B) a helical
twist of the outside geometry. The spun material systems comprise classical
polymer solutions as well as metal-polymer slurries resulting in solid porous
metallic monolithic membrane after thermal post-processing. It is known that
twisted spiral-type bore channel geometries are potentially superior over
straight channels with respect to mass and heat polarization phenomena, however
their fabrication was cumber- some in the past. Now, the described methodology
enables membrane fabrication to tailor the membrane geometry to the needs of
the membrane process.

mechanism of the conversion of the initial energy of projectiles into a number
of secondaries by measuring their multiplicity distributions and their
distributions in phase space. They therefore serve as a reference point for
more involved measurements. Distributions in phase space are usually
investigated using the statistical approach, very successful in general but
failing in cases of small colliding systems, small multiplicities, and at the
edges of the allowed phase space, in which cases the underlying dynamical
effects competing with the statistical distributions take over. We discuss an
alternative approach, which applies to the whole phase space without detailed
knowledge of dynamics. It is based on a modification of the usual statistics by
generalizing it to a superstatistical form. We stress particularly the scaling
and self-similar properties of such an approach manifesting themselves as the
phenomena of the log-periodic oscillations and oscillations of temperature
caused by sound waves in hadronic matter. Concerning the multiplicity
distributions we discuss in detail the phenomenon of the oscillatory behaviour
of the modified combinants apparently observed in experimental data.

applications. A newly proposed approach takes advantage of the local
characteristics of the most probable particle motion instead of the divergent
averages. We experimentally verify its theoretical predictions for a Brownian
particle moving near an inflection in a highly unstable cubic optical
potential. The most-likely position of the particle atypically shifts against
the force despite the trajectories diverge in the opposite direction. The local
uncertainty around the most-likely position saturates even for strong diffusion
and enables well-resolved position detection. Remarkably, the measured particle
distribution quickly converges to the quasi-stationary one with the same
atypical shift for different initial particle positions. The demonstrated
experimental confirmation of the theoretical predictions approves the utility
of local characteristics for highly unstable systems which can be exploited in
thermodynamic processes to uncover energetics of unstable systems.

consists of a stable and robust integration of three blocks of differential
equations, viz., incompressible viscous fluid, a rigid or flexible structure
and two-phase indicator field. The fluid-fluid interface between the two
phases, which may have high density and viscosity ratios, is evolved by solving
the conservative phase-field Allen-Cahn equation in the arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian coordinates. While the Navier-Stokes equations are solved
by a stabilized Petrov-Galerkin method, the conservative Allen-Chan phase-field
equation is discretized by the positivity preserving variational scheme. Fully
decoupled implicit solvers for the two-phase fluid and the structure are
integrated by the nonlinear iterative force correction in a staggered
partitioned manner. We assess the accuracy and stability of the new
phase-field/ALE variational formulation for two- and three-dimensional problems
involving the dynamical interaction of rigid bodies with free-surface. We
consider the decay test problems of increasing complexity, namely free
translational heave decay of a circular cylinder and free rotation of a
rectangular barge. Through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed
formulation is stable and robust for high density ratios across fluid-fluid
interface and for low structure-to-fluid mass ratio with strong added-mass

require dense ${\it k}$-point sampling of the Brillouin zone and are therefore
typically limited to the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), whereas more
accurate methods such as hybrid functionals would have been preferable. GGA
variants, however, generally underestimate the band gap. While premature onset
of minority carriers can be avoided with scissor corrections, the band gap also
affects the band curvature. In this study, we resolved the ${\it k}$-point
sampling issue in hybrid-functional based calculations by extending our
recently developed ${\it k}\cdot\tilde{{\it p}}$ interpolation scheme [Comput.

coupling. The Seebeck coefficient generated based on hybrid functionals were
found to agree better than GGA with experimental data for GaAs, InP, and PbTe.
For PbTe, even the choice of hybrid functional has bearing on the
interpretation of experimental data, which we attribute to the description of
valley convergence of the valence band.

revisit a mechanism first investigated in the context of neuroscience by which
relatively small demographic (intrinsic) fluctuations can lead to the emergence
of avalanching behavior in systems that are deterministically characterized by
a single stable fixed point (up state). The anomalously large response of such

large variety of methodologies and applied to a wide range of scenarios.
Reservoir Computing (RC) provides efficient tools to generate a vectorial,
fixed-size representation of the MTS that can be further processed by standard
classifiers. Despite their unrivaled training speed, MTS classifiers based on a
standard RC architecture fail to achieve the same accuracy of fully trainable
neural networks. In this paper we introduce the reservoir model space, an
unsupervised approach based on RC to learn vectorial representations of MTS.
Each MTS is encoded within the parameters of a linear model trained to predict
a low-dimensional embedding of the reservoir dynamics. Compared to other RC
methods, our model space yields better representations and attains comparable
computational performance, thanks to an intermediate dimensionality reduction
procedure. As a second contribution we propose a modular RC framework for MTS
classification, with an associated open-source Python library. The framework
provides different modules to seamlessly implement advanced RC architectures.
The architectures are compared to other MTS classifiers, including deep
learning models and time series kernels. Results obtained on benchmark and
real-world MTS datasets show that RC classifiers are dramatically faster and,
when implemented using our proposed representation, also achieve superior
classification accuracy.

stellar objects provide an important source of ionization, and as such, play an
important role in disk evolution and planet formation. However, these incoming
cosmic rays are affected by a variety of physical processes internal to
stellar/disk systems, including modulation by turbulent magnetic fields.
Globally, these fields naturally provide both a funneling effect, where cosmic
rays from larger volumes are focused into the disk region, and a magnetic
mirroring effect, where cosmic rays are repelled due to the increasing field
strength. This paper considers cosmic ray propagation in the presence of a
turbulent spiral magnetic field, analogous to that produced by the Solar wind.
The interaction of this wind with the interstellar medium defines a transition
radius, analogous to the Heliopause, which provides the outer boundary to this
problem. We construct a new coordinate system where one coordinate follows the
spiral magnetic field lines and consider magnetic perturbations to the field in
the perpendicular directions. The presence of magnetic turbulence replaces the
mirroring points with a distribution of values and moves the mean location
outward. Our results thus help quantify the degree to which cosmic ray fluxes
are reduced in circumstellar disks by the presence of magnetic field structures
that are shaped by stellar winds. The new coordinate system constructed herein
should also be useful in other astronomical applications.

bursts (GRBs), while the short GRBs are associated with the mergers of compact
objects. In the first case, mainly the energetics of the events is consistent
with the proposed progenitor models, while the duration, time variability, as
well as the afterglow emission may shed some light on the detailed properties
of the collapsing massive stars. In the latter case, the recent discovery of
the binary neutron star (NS-NS) merger in the gravitational wave observation
made by LIGO (GW170817), and the detection of associated electromagnetic
counterparts, for the first time gave a direct proof of the NS-NS merger being
a progenitor of a short GRB.
  In general, all GRBs are believed to be powered by accretion through a
rotationally supported torus, or by fast rotation of a compact object. For long
ones, the rotation of the progenitor star is a key property in order to support
accretion over relatively long activity periods, and also to sustain the
rotation of the black hole itself. The latter is responsible for ejection of
the relativistic jets, which are powered due to the extraction of the BH
rotational energy, mitigated by the accretion torus and magnetic fields. The
jets must break through the stellar envelope though, which poses a question on
the efficiency of this process. Similar mechanisms of powering the jet ejection
may act in short GRBs, which in this case may freely propagate through the
interstellar medium. The power of the jets launched from the rotating black
hole is at first associated mostly with the magnetic Poynting flux, and then at
large distances it is transferred to the kinetic and finally radiative energy
of the expanding shells.

maximizing the secrecy rate via jointly optimizing the relay trajectory and the

trajectory designing and the power allocating, the secrecy rate maximization
(SRM) problem is intractable to solve. Accordingly, we propose an alternating
optimization (AO) approach, wherein the trajectory designing and the power
allocating are tackled in an alternating manner. Unfortunately, the trajectory
designing is a nonconvex problem, and thus is still hard to solve. To
circumvent the nonconvexity, we exploit sequential convex programming (SCP) to
derive an iterative algorithm, which is proven to converge to a
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the trajectory design problem. The simulation
results demonstrate the efficacy of the joint power and trajectory design in
improving the secrecy throughput.

Earth is not alone in possessing natural, inter-annual atmospheric cycles. The
equatorial middle atmospheres of the Earth, Jupiter and Saturn all exhibit a
remarkably similar phenomenon - a vertical, cyclic pattern of alternating
temperatures and zonal (east-west) wind regimes that propagate slowly downwards
with a well-defined multi-Earth-year period. Earth's Quasi-Biennial Oscillation
(QBO, observed in the lower stratospheres with an average period of 28 months)
is one of the most regular, repeatable cycles exhibited by our climate system,
and yet recent work has shown that this regularity can be disrupted by events
occurring far away from the equatorial region, an example of a phenomenon known
as atmospheric teleconnection. Here we reveal that Saturn's equatorial
Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO, with a ~15-year period) can also be
dramatically perturbed. An intense springtime storm erupted at Saturn's
northern mid-latitudes in December 2010, spawning a gigantic hot vortex in the
stratosphere at $40^\circ$N that persisted for 3 years. Far from the storm, the
Cassini temperature measurements showed a dramatic $\sim10$-K cooling in the
0.5-5 mbar range across the entire equatorial region, disrupting the regular
QPO pattern and significantly altering the middle-atmospheric wind structure,
suggesting an injection of westward momentum into the equatorial wind system
from waves generated by the northern storm. Hence, as on Earth, meteorological
activity at mid-latitudes can have a profound effect on the regular atmospheric
cycles in the tropics, demonstrating that waves can provide horizontal
teleconnections between the phenomena shaping the middle atmospheres of giant
planets.

designed Turing systems for implementation in cell colonies, but none have yet
led to visible patterns in the laboratory. In both cases, the relationship
between underlying chemistry and emergent biology remains mysterious. To help
resolve the mystery, this article asks the question: what kinds of biochemical
systems can generate Turing patterns? We find general conditions for Turing
pattern inception -- the ability to generate unstable patterns from random
noise -- which may lead to the ultimate formation of stable patterns, depending
on biochemical non-linearities. We find that a wide variety of systems can
generate stable Turing patterns, including several which are currently unknown,
such as two-species systems composed of two self-activators, and systems
composed of a short-range inhibitor and a long-range activator. We furthermore
find that systems which are widely believed to generate stable patterns may in
fact only generate unstable patterns, which ultimately converge to
spatially-homogeneous concentrations. Our results suggest that a much wider
variety of systems than is commonly believed could be responsible for observed
patterns in development, or could be good candidates for synthetic patterning

prototype to describe people interactions in different kinds of social
organizations and, here, it is considered by means of three features of human
interactions: the mobility, the duration of the interaction among people, and
the dependence of the number of interactions of each person on the time
evolution of the system. For this purpose, the initial configuration of the
system is set as a regular square lattice where the nodes are the individuals
which, in turn, are able to move in a random walk along the network. So, the
connectivity among the individuals evolve with time and is defined by the
positions of the individuals at each iteration. In a time unit, each individual
is able move up to a distance $v$ creating different networks along the time
evolution of the system. In addition, the individuals are interacting with each
other only if they are within the interaction distance $\delta$ and, in this
case, they are considered as neighbors. If a given individual is interacting
with other ones, he performs the random walk with a diffusion probability
$\omega$. Otherwise, the diffusion occurs with probability 1. The study was
carried out through non-equilibrium Monte Carlo Simulations and we take into
account the asynchronous updating scheme. The results show that, for a given
$v>0$, there exist a critical line in the $(c, \delta)$ space, where $c$ is the
immunization rate. We also obtain the dynamic critical exponent $\theta$ for
some points belonging to this line and show that this model does not belong to

salience is often accumulated over a long time period and does not account for

short-, mid, and longer-term periodicities are represented and decomposed by
the SST with hardly any mode mixing. This demonstrates that the SST is a useful
time--frequency analysis technique to characterize the periodic modes of
helioseismic data. Apart from the fundamental modes of the annual periodicity,
$\sim$27 day rotational cycle and $\sim$11 year solar cycle, the SST reveals
several midterm periodicities in the two magnetic activity indices,
specifically, $\sim$157 day (i.e., Rieger-type periodicity), and $\sim$1.3 and
1.7 years. The periodic modes, with 116.4 and 276.2 day periodicity in the
MPSI, with 108.5 and 251.6 day periodicity in the MWSI, and the 157.7 day
periodicity in the two indices, are in better accord with those significant
periodicities derived from the Rossby waves theoretical model. This study
suggests that the modes are caused by the Rossby waves. For the 1.30 and 1.71
year periodicity of the MPSI, and the 1.33 and 1.67 year periodicity of the
MWSI, our analysis infers that they are related to those periodicity with the
same timescale in the interior of the Sun and in the high atmospheric layers.

which are tracers of high-redshift galaxies intervening background quasars, is
a powerful tool for probing magnetic fields in distant galaxies. Statistically
comparing the RM distributions of two quasar samples, with and without
absorption line systems, allows one to infer magnetic field properties of the
intervening galaxy population. Here, we have derived the analytical form of the
probability distribution function (PDF) of RM produced by a single galaxy with
an axisymmetric large-scale magnetic field. We then further determine the PDF
of RM for one random sight line traversing each galaxy in a population with a
large-scale magnetic field prescription. We find that the resulting PDF of RM
is dominated by a Lorentzian with a width that is directly related to the mean
axisymmetric large-scale field strength $\langle B_0 \rangle$ of the galaxy
population if the dispersion of $B_0$ within the population is smaller than
$\langle B_0 \rangle$. Provided that RMs produced by the intervening galaxies
have been successfully isolated from other RM contributions along the line of
sight, our simple model suggests that $\langle B_0 \rangle$ in galaxies probed
by quasar absorption line systems can be measured within $\approx50$ per cent
accuracy without additional constraints on the magneto-ionic medium properties
of the galaxies. Finally, we discuss quasar sample selection criteria that are
crucial to reliably interpret observations, and argue that within the
limitations of the current database of absorption line systems,
high-metallicity damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers are best suited to study
galactic dynamo action in distant disc galaxies.

have provided a powerful complement to international ground-based microlensing
surveys, with major breakthroughs in parallax measurements and probing new
regions of the Galaxy. The scientific vitality of these projects has also
promoted the development of the U.S. microlensing community.
  In the 2020s, the U.S. can continue to play a major role in ground-based
microlensing by leveraging U.S. assets to complement ongoing ground-based
international surveys. LSST and UKIRT microlensing surveys would probe vast
regions of the Galaxy, where planets form under drastically different
conditions. Moreover, while ground-based surveys will measure the planet
mass-ratio function beyond the snow line, adaptive optics (AO) observations
with ELTs would turn all of these mass ratios into masses and also distinguish
between very wide-orbit planets and genuine FFPs. To the extent possible,

that entropic nonlocal correlations are monogamous, entropic contextuality

many of the objects in regions near of the MW bulge where no GC had been

in events with large missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at
the LHC at CERN. In searches in all-hadronic final states in the CMS and ATLAS
experiments, the angle $\Delta\varphi_i$, the azimuthal angle between a jet and
the missing transverse momentum, is widely used to reduce QCD multijet
background events with large missing transverse momentum, which is primarily
caused by a jet momentum mismeasurement or neutrinos in hadron decays-the
missing transverse momentum is aligned with a jet. A related angular
variable-denoted by $\Delta\varphi^*_\text{min}$, the minimum of the azimuthal
angles between a jet and the transverse momentum imbalance of the other jets in
the event-is used instead in a series of searches in all-hadronic final states
in CMS to suppress QCD multijet background events to a negligible level. In
this paper, before introducing the alternative variables, we review the
variable $\Delta\varphi^*_\text{min}$ in detail and identify room for
improvement, in particular, to maintain good acceptances for signal models with
high jet multiplicity final states. Furthermore, we demonstrate with simulated

outperform $\Delta\varphi^*_\text{min}$ and $\Delta\varphi_i$ in rejecting QCD

Standard Model (SM) and possible new-physics contributions there. To test any
new-physics hypothesis, sound knowledge of the SM contributions is necessary,
with a precision which at least matches the experimental uncertainties of
existing and forthcoming measurements. In this article we present a detailed
study of the vector-boson scattering process with two positively-charged
leptons and missing transverse momentum in the final state. In particular, we
first carry out a systematic comparison of the various approximations that are
usually performed for this kind of process against the complete calculation, at
LO and NLO QCD accuracy. Such a study is performed both in the usual fiducial
region used by experimental collaborations and in a more inclusive phase space,
where the differences among the various approximations lead to more sizeable
effects. Afterwards, we turn to predictions matched to parton showers, at LO
and NLO: we show that on the one hand, the inclusion of NLO QCD corrections
leads to more stable predictions, but on the other hand the details of the
matching and of the parton-shower programs cause differences which are
considerably larger than those observed at fixed order, even in the
experimental fiducial region. We conclude with recommendations for experimental
studies of vector-boson scattering processes.

properties of thermally activated magnons in the presence of an external spin

generation of a heat flux by spin accumulation -- in an antiferromagnetic
insulator with cubic or uniaxial magnetic symmetry. This effect is related with
spin-current induced splitting of the relaxation times of the magnons with
opposite spin direction. We show that the Peltier effect can trigger
antiferromagnetic domain wall motion with a force whose value grows with the
temperature of a sample. At a temperature, larger than the energy of the
low-frequency magnons, this force is much larger than the force caused by
direct spin transfer between the spin current and the domain wall. We also
demonstrate that the external spin current can induce the magnon spin Seebeck
effect. The corresponding Seebeck coefficient is controlled by the current
density. These spin-current assisted caloric effects open new ways for the
manipulation of the magnetic states in antiferromagnets.

variety of visual understanding tasks, it is often impeded by hardware
constraints (e.g., GPU memory) and is prone to overfitting. When it comes to
video captioning, one of the most challenging benchmark tasks in computer
vision, those limitations of E2E learning are especially amplified by the fact
that both the input videos and output captions are lengthy sequences. Indeed,
state-of-the-art methods for video captioning process video frames by
convolutional neural networks and generate captions by unrolling recurrent
neural networks. If we connect them in an E2E manner, the resulting model is
both memory-consuming and data-hungry, making it extremely hard to train. In
this paper, we propose a multitask reinforcement learning approach to training
an E2E video captioning model. The main idea is to mine and construct as many
effective tasks (e.g., attributes, rewards, and the captions) as possible from
the human captioned videos such that they can jointly regulate the search space
of the E2E neural network, from which an E2E video captioning model can be
found and generalized to the testing phase. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first video captioning model that is trained end-to-end from the raw
video input to the caption output. Experimental results show that such a model
outperforms existing ones to a large margin on two benchmark video captioning
datasets.

the credibility of the design by testing the continuity of the density of the
running variable at the cut-off, e.g., McCrary (2008). In this paper we propose
an approximate sign test for continuity of a density at a point based on the
so-called g-order statistics, and study its properties under two complementary
asymptotic frameworks. In the first asymptotic framework, the number q of
observations local to the cut-off is fixed as the sample size n diverges to
infinity, while in the second framework q diverges to infinity slowly as n
diverges to infinity. Under both of these frameworks, we show that the test we
propose is asymptotically valid in the sense that it has limiting rejection
probability under the null hypothesis not exceeding the nominal level. More
importantly, the test is easy to implement, asymptotically valid under weaker
conditions than those used by competing methods, and exhibits finite sample
validity under stronger conditions than those needed for its asymptotic
validity. In a simulation study, we find that the approximate sign test
provides good control of the rejection probability under the null hypothesis
while remaining competitive under the alternative hypothesis. We finally apply
our test to the design in Lee (2008), a well-known application of the RDD to
study incumbency advantage.

sequential selection of a few system elements, such as sensors, data, or

However, in failure-prone and adversarial environments, sensors get attacked,

paradigms become insufficient and, in contrast, resilient sequential designs
that adapt against system-wide attacks, deletions, or failures become
important. In general, resilient sequential design problems are computationally
hard. Also, even though they often involve objective functions that are
monotone and (possibly) submodular, no scalable approximation algorithms are
known for their solution. In this paper, we provide the first scalable
algorithm, that achieves the following characteristics: system-wide resiliency,
i.e., the algorithm is valid for any number of denial-of-service attacks,
deletions, or failures; adaptiveness, i.e., at each time step, the algorithm
selects system elements based on the history of inflicted attacks, deletions,

guarantees for monotone objective functions a solution close to the optimal. We
quantify the algorithm's approximation performance using a notion of curvature

affects the quality of photos. Despite numerous image dehazing methods have
been proposed, effective hazy image restoration remains a challenging problem.
Existing learning-based methods usually predict the medium transmission by
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but ignore the key global atmospheric
light. Different from previous learning-based methods, we propose a flexible
cascaded CNN for single hazy image restoration, which considers the medium
transmission and global atmospheric light jointly by two task-driven
subnetworks. Specifically, the medium transmission estimation subnetwork is
inspired by the densely connected CNN while the global atmospheric light
estimation subnetwork is a light-weight CNN. Besides, these two subnetworks are
cascaded by sharing the common features. Finally, with the estimated model
parameters, the haze-free image is obtained by the atmospheric scattering model
inversion, which achieves more accurate and effective restoration performance.
Qualitatively and quantitatively experimental results on the synthetic and
real-world hazy images demonstrate that the proposed method effectively removes
haze from such images, and outperforms several state-of-the-art dehazing
methods.

Centaurs and KBOs, the color V-I is in nice agreement with both populations.
The large error-bars prevents from assigning Neso to any of the reference

can rule out its membership in classes of resonant objects or Plutinos.

diffusion model called same place different time (SPDT) transmission to capture
the indirect transmissions that happen when an infected individual leaves
before a susceptible individual's arrival along with direct transmissions. In
this paper, we demonstrate how these indirect transmission links significantly
enhance the emergence of infectious diseases simulating airborne disease
spreading on a synthetic social contact network. We denote individuals having
indirect links but no direct links during their infectious periods as hidden
spreaders. Our simulation shows that indirect links play similar roles of
direct links and a single hidden spreader can cause large outbreak in the SPDT
model which causes no infection in the current model based on direct link. Our
work opens new direction in modeling infectious diseases.

widely heterogeneous data. This information can be retrieved from network
traffic traces, network alarms, signal quality indicators, users' behavioral
data, etc. Advanced mathematical tools are required to extract meaningful
information from these data and take decisions pertaining to the proper
functioning of the networks from the network-generated data. Among these
mathematical tools, Machine Learning (ML) is regarded as one of the most
promising methodological approaches to perform network-data analysis and enable
automated network self-configuration and fault management. The adoption of ML
techniques in the field of optical communication networks is motivated by the
unprecedented growth of network complexity faced by optical networks in the
last few years. Such complexity increase is due to the introduction of a huge
number of adjustable and interdependent system parameters (e.g., routing
configurations, modulation format, symbol rate, coding schemes, etc.) that are
enabled by the usage of coherent transmission/reception technologies, advanced
digital signal processing and compensation of nonlinear effects in optical
fiber propagation. In this paper we provide an overview of the application of
ML to optical communications and networking. We classify and survey relevant
literature dealing with the topic, and we also provide an introductory tutorial
on ML for researchers and practitioners interested in this field. Although a
good number of research papers have recently appeared, the application of ML to
optical networks is still in its infancy: to stimulate further work in this
area, we conclude the paper proposing new possible research directions.

negative sign which could express friendly or unfriendly relationship between
individuals. When diseases spreading over the signed network, some unfriendly
edges may refuse to spread. Moreover, the signed network is dynamic, according
to the structure balance theory which is the most important theory in the study
of signed network, edges in the signed network will flip their signs over time.
How does disease spreading interact with signed network evolving becomes a
challenging issue. In this paper, we propose an energy function to describe the
disease spreading and network evolving together, and we introduce the notion of
Structure and Spreading Balanced. We extend the structure balance theory of
Cartwright and propose a Structure and Spreading theorem. Finally, we carry out
Monte-Carlo simulations on complete signed network to validate our theorem. In
the experiment, we find that the signed network has self-immunity during
disease spreading, which can be used explain the phenomenon of isolating the

present a new spacetime model containing closed timelike curves (CTCs). This
model is obtained postulating an ad hoc Lorentzian metric on $\mathbb{R}^4$,
which differs from the Minkowski metric only inside a spacetime region bounded
by two concentric tori. The resulting spacetime is topologically trivial, free
of curvature singularities and is both time and space orientable; besides, the
inner region enclosed by the smaller torus is flat and displays geodesic CTCs.
Our model shares some similarities with the time machine of Ori and Soen but it
has the advantage of a higher symmetry in the metric, allowing for the explicit
computation of a class of geodesics. The most remarkable feature emerging from
this computation is the presence of future-oriented timelike geodesics starting
from a point in the outer Minkowskian region, moving to the inner spacetime
region with CTCs, and then returning to the initial spatial position at an
earlier time; this means that time travel to the past can be performed by free
fall across our time machine. The amount of time travelled into the past is
determined quantitatively; this amount can be made arbitrarily large keeping
non-large the proper duration of the travel. An important drawback of the model
is the violation of the classical energy conditions, a common feature of many
time machines. Other problems emerge from our computations of the required
(negative) energy densities and of the tidal accelerations; these are small
only if the time machine is gigantic.

involving compliant materials, such as polymers and gels, show a hysteresis
loop whose size depends on the maximum indentation depth. This depth-dependent
hysteresis (DDH) is not explained by classical contact mechanics theories and
was believed to be due to effects such as material viscoelasticity, plasticity,
surface polymer interdigitation, and moisture, etc. It has been observed that
the DDH energy loss initially increases and then decreases with roughness. A
mechanics model based on the occurrence of adhesion and roughness related
small-scale instabilities was presented by one of the authors for explaining
DDH. However, that model only applies in the regime of infinitesimally small
surface roughness, and consequently it does not capture the decrease in energy
loss with surface roughness at the large roughness regime. We present a new
mechanics model that applies in the regime of large surface roughness based on
the Maugis--Dugdale theory of adhesive elastic contacts and Nayak's theory of
rough surfaces. The model captures the trend of decreasing energy loss with
increasing roughness. It also captures the experimentally observed dependencies
of energy loss on the maximum indentation depth, and material and surface
properties.

Performance Computing (HPC) system architects make use of simulation models for
design space exploration and hardware-software co-design. However, as HPC
systems reach exascale proportions, the cost of simulation increases, since
simulators themselves are largely single-threaded. Tools for selecting
representative parts of parallel applications to reduce running costs are
widespread, e.g., BarrierPoint achieves this by analysing, in simulation,
abstract characteristics such as basic blocks and reuse distances. However,
architectures new to HPC have a limited set of tools available.
  In this work, we provide an independent cross-architectural evaluation on
real hardware - across Intel and ARM - of the BarrierPoint methodology, when
applied to parallel HPC proxy applications. We present both cases: when the
methodology can be applied and when it cannot. In the former case, results show
that we can predict the performance of full application execution by running
shorter representative sections. In the latter case, we dive into the
underlying issues and suggest improvements. We demonstrate a total simulation
time reduction of up to 178x, whilst keeping the error below 2.3% for both

Performing an accurate, complete and unbiased SLR is however a difficult and
expensive endeavor. This is true in general for all phases of a literature
review, and in particular for the paper screening phase, where authors lter a
set of potentially in-scope papers based on a number of exclusion criteria. To
address the problem, in recent years the research community has began to
explore the use of the crowd to allow for a faster, accurate, cheaper and
unbiased screening of papers. Initial results show that crowdsourcing can be
effective, even for relatively complex reviews. In this paper we derive and
analyze a set of strategies for crowd-based screening, and show that an
adaptive strategy, that continuously re-assesses the statistical properties of
the problem to minimize the number of votes needed to take decisions for each
paper, significantly outperforms a number of non-adaptive approaches in terms
of cost and accuracy. We validate both applicability and results of the
approach through a set of crowdsourcing experiments, and discuss properties of
the problem and algorithms that we believe to be generally of interest for
classification problems where items are classified via a series of successive

altitudes. We also explore the effect of wetting liquid on the conformation
developed. When released from an altitude, the thread conformation changes when
free falling and reaches the stable conformation (identified by a constant
end-to-end distance) after fall over a period of time. We identified that the
conformation of the threads replicated the conformation of long polymer chains.
Therefore, we applied a two-dimensional random walk model to explain the stable
conformation where the thread length is treated as the random walk time (number
of polymer segment). A two-dimensional random walk model was used since during
free fall, the conformation is assumed to develop on the horizontal plane.
Surprisingly, we get the scaling power that is exactly similar to the scale
power of two dimensional random (walk). By fitting how end-to-end distance
changes with time, we obtain an equation that is exactly similar to modified
Avrami equation for process of phase transformation in one-dimension space (D =
1), where the exponential power is n = D+1 = 2. Therefore, we can state that
the time evolution of thread conformation process is identical to
crystallization process in one dimensional space. This is very interesting
finding, showing that the microscopic process (crystallization) can be
replicated in macroscopic scale.

are successfully introduced to an all-vanadium redox flow battery. Activated
carbon and graphite powder particles are dispersed up to 20 wt% in the vanadium

3D-printed conductive static mixers introduced to the slurry channel improve
the charge transfer via intensified slurry mixing and increased surface area.
Consequently, a significant increase in the coulombic efficiency up to 95% and
