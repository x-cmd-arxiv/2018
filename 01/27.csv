MAVEN was crossing the dayside magnetosphere at SZA ~ 70{\deg}. Magnetosphere
as the region with prevailing energetic planetary ions is always found between
the magnetosheath and the ionosphere. 3 angular sectors of dayside interaction
region in MSE coordinate system with different orientation of the solar wind
electric field vector E = -1/c V x B showed that for each sector one can find
specific profiles of the magnetosheath, the magnetic barrier and the
magnetosphere. Plume ions originate in the northern MSE sector where motion
electric field is directed from the planet. This electric field ejects
magnetospheric ions leading to dilution of magnetospheric heavy ions
population, and this effect is seen in some magnetospheric profiles. Magnetic
barrier forms in front of the magnetosphere, and relative magnetic field
magnitudes in these two domains vary. The average height of the boundary with
ionosphere is ~530 km and the average height of the magnetopause is ~730 km. We
discuss the implications of the observed magnetosphere structure to the

metal, metallo-dielectric or photonic crystal nanocavities. While the
technology of nanolasers is steadily being deployed, their expected performance
for on-chip optical interconnects is still largely unknown due to a limited
understanding of some of their key features. Specifically, as the cavity size
is reduced with respect to the emission wavelength, the stimulated and the
spontaneous emission rates are modified, which is known as the Purcell effect
in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics. This effect is expected to
have a major impact in the 'threshold-less' behavior of nanolasers and in their
modulation speed, but its role is poorly understood in practical laser
structures, characterized by significant homogeneous and inhomogeneous
broadening and by a complex spatial distribution of the active material and
cavity field. In this work, we investigate the role of Purcell effect in the
stimulated and spontaneous emission rates of semiconductor lasers taking into
account the carriers' spatial distribution in the volume of the active region
over a wide range of cavity dimensions and emitter/cavity linewidths, enabling
the detailed modeling of the static and dynamic characteristics of either
micro- or nano-scale lasers using single-mode rate-equations analysis. The
ultimate limits of scaling down these nanoscale light sources in terms of
Purcell enhancement and modulation speed are also discussed showing that the
ultrafast modulation properties predicted in nanolasers are a direct
consequence of the enhancement of the stimulated emission rate via reduction of
the mode volume.

one may want to identify an aggregate score that is reliably reproduced across

identifying components that are maximally correlated between repetitions (e.g.
trials, subjects, raters). Here we formalize this as the maximization of the
ratio of between-repetition to within-repetition covariance. We show that this
criterion maximizes repeat-reliability, defined as mean over variance across
repeats, and that it leads to CorrCA or to multi-set Canonical Correlation
Analysis, depending on the constraints. Surprisingly, we also find that CorrCA
is equivalent to Linear Discriminant Analysis for zero-mean signals, which
provides an unexpected link between classic concepts of multivariate analysis.

thus become obsolete. The main difficulty with bounds computation is to
correctly take into account the high uncertainty about the inflows to the

while providing formal guarantees about the quality of the obtained solutions.
The uncertainty is embedded using either stochastic or robust programming in a

K. More than 95 % of NH2CHO diffuses through the water ice surface towards the
graphitic substrate and is released into the gas phase with a desorption energy
distribution (7460-9380 K), which is measured with the best-fit pre-exponential
factor A=10^18 s-1. However, the desorption energy distribution of methylamine
from the np-ASW ice surface (3850-8420 K) is measured with the best-fit
pre-exponential factor A=10^12 s-1. A fraction of solid methylamine monolayer
of roughly 0.15 diffuses through the water ice surface towards the HOPG
substrate. This small amount desorbs later with higher binding energies
(5050-8420 K).

outflow velocity of $\sim-0.25c$. Here we unveil a new, relativistic component
of the wind through hard X-ray observations with NuSTAR and XMM-Newton,
obtained in March 2017 when the quasar was in a low flux state. This very fast
wind component, with an outflow velocity of $-0.46\pm0.02c$, is detected in the
iron K band, in addition to the $-0.25c$ wind zone. The relativistic component
may arise from the innermost disk wind, launched from close to the black hole
at radius of $\sim10$ gravitational radii. The opacity of the fast wind also
increases during a possible obscuration event lasting for 50 ks. We suggest
that the very fast wind may only be apparent during the lowest X-ray flux
states of PDS 456, becoming overly ionized as the luminosity increases.
Overall, the total wind power may even approach the Eddington value.

task. The scaled complex Wishart distribution is a widely used model for PolSAR

the complex covariance matrix. The last parameter contains all the necessary

whether the complex covariance matrices differ at two or more takes. This paper
proposes a comparison between a classical change detection method based on the

dominant component of SEI layers. Here, we adopt a parameterized,
non-polarizable MD force field for Li2EDC to study transport characteristics of
Li+ in this model SEI layer at moderate temperatures. The observed correlations
are consistent with recent MD results using a polarizable force field,
suggesting that this non-polarizable model is effective for our purposes of
investigating Li+ dynamics over long time scales. Mean-squared displacements
distinguish three distinct Li+ transport regimes in EDC ballistic, trapping,
and diffusive. Compared to liquid ethylene carbonate (EC), the nanosecond
trapping times in EDC are significantly longer and naturally decrease at higher
temperatures. New materials developed for fast-charging Li-ion batteries should
have smaller trapping regions. The analyses implemented in this paper can be
used for testing transport of Li+ ion in novel battery materials. Non-Gaussian
features of van Hove self -correlation functions for Li+ in EDC, along with the
mean-squared displacements, are consistent in describing EDC as a glassy
material compared with liquid EC. Vibrational modes of Li+ ion, identified by
MD, characterize the trapping and are further validated by electronic structure

microseconds, to infer the surface power reflection coefficient $\cal{R}$. The
first HiCal mission (HiCal-1, Jan. 2015) yielded a sample of 100 such pairs,
resulting in estimates of $\cal{R}$ at highly-glancing angles (i.e., zenith
angles approaching $90^\circ$), with measured reflectivity for those events
which exceeded extant calculations. The HiCal-2 experiment, flying from Dec.,
2016-Jan., 2017, provided an improvement by nearly two orders of magnitude in
our event statistics, allowing a considerably more precise mapping of the
reflectivity over a wider range of incidence angles. We find general agreement
between the HiCal-2 reflectivity results and those obtained with the earlier

have matured; herein, we use a plane-wave expansion to estimate the

perform on the PE file. Through a series of games played against the
anti-malware engine, it learns which sequences of operations are likely to
result in evading the detector for any given malware sample. This enables
completely black-box attacks against static PE anti-malware, and produces
functional evasive malware samples as a direct result. We show in experiments
that our method can attack a gradient-boosted machine learning model with
evasion rates that are substantial and appear to be strongly dependent on the
dataset. We demonstrate that attacks against this model appear to also evade
components of publicly hosted antivirus engines. Adversarial training results
are also presented: by retraining the model on evasive ransomware samples, a
subsequent attack is 33% less effective. However, there are overfitting dangers
when adversarial training, which we note. We release code to allow researchers
to reproduce and improve this approach.

important in predicting the period and also the vastness of the upcoming large

report some exponential anti-correlation behaviors for $s(T)$ and $\tau(n)$

hybrid junction devices are studied. The energy spectra and the wave functions
of the subgap states are calculated as a function of the superconducting phase
differences between TSNWs and as a function of the QD level energy based on the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes tight-binding Hamiltonians. It is shown that when the QD
level is located near or inside the superconducting gap, there can exist eight
subgap states. Among them, four low energy (two positive and two negative)
subgap states are essentially formed by linear combinations of the six Majorana
bound states (MBSs) located at the ends of the three TSNWs. The remaining four
high energy subgap states are mainly built from linear combinations of the QD
state and the three MBSs of the TSNWs adjacent to the QD. When there is no QD
level near or inside the superconducting gap, only six subgap states built from
linear combinations of the six MBSs of the three TSNWs can be present in the
system. It is also shown that there exists a unique point in the parameter
space of the superconducting phase differences between TSNWs, at which the
energies of the six low energy subgap states move close to each other towards
nearly zero energies. Simple but general effective model Hamiltonians for the
three-terminal TSNW-QD hybrid devices have also been developed. Based on the

a Theorem in the spirit of a famous result from Kahn, Kalai and Linial (cf.

quartic scaling of the CMB anisotropy spectra with the PMF strength, this bound
will not change by much even with the significantly better measurements of the
B-mode spectrum by the Stage III and Stage IV CMB experiments. On the other
hand, tightening the bound well below the $1$ nG threshold would rule out the
purely primordial origin (requiring no dynamo action) of galactic fields.
Considering Faraday rotation, which converts some of the E-modes into B-modes
and scales linearly with the field strength, will help to achieve this goal. As
we demonstrate, the upcoming experiments, such as SPT-3G and the Simons
Observatory, will be sensitive to fields of $\sim 0.5$ nG strength thanks to
the mode-coupling signature induced by Faraday rotation. A future Stage IV
ground based experiment or a Space Probe will be capable of probing fields
below $0.1$ nG, and would detect a scale-invariant PMF of $0.2$ nG strength
without de-lensing or subtracting the galactic rotation measure.

acquired by Cosmic Microwave Background (\cmb) experiments is one of the most
important steps in the context of \cmb data analysis referred to as the
map-making problem. The continuously growing \cmb data sets render the \cmb
map-making problem more challenging in terms of computational cost and memory
in particular in the context of ground based experiments. In this context, we
study a novel class of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) solvers
which invoke two-level preconditioners. We compare them against PCG solvers
commonly used in the map-making context considering their precision and
time-to-solution. We compare these new methods on realistic, simulated data
sets reflecting the characteristics of current and forthcoming \cmb
ground-based experiment. We develop an embarrassingly parallel implementation
of the approach where each processor performs a sequential map-making for a
subset of the TOD. We find that considering the map level residuals the new
class of solvers permits achieving tolerance of up to 3 orders of magnitude
better than the standard approach, where the residual level often saturates
before convergence is reached. This corresponds to an important improvement in
the precision of recovered power spectra in particular on the largest angular
scales. The new method also typically requires fewer iterations to reach a
required precision and thus shorter runtimes for a single map-making solution.
However, the construction of an appropriate two-level preconditioner can be as
costly as a single standard map-making run. Nevertheless, if the same problem
needs to be solved multiple times, e.g., as in Monte Carlo simulations, this
cost has to be incurred only once, and the method should be competitive not
only as far as its precision but also its performance is concerned.

presence of bound states at their physical edges. These topological edge modes
can be distinguished from usual Shockley waves energetically, as their energies
remain finite and in-gap. On a clean 1D or reducible 2D model, in either the
commensurate or semi-infinite case, the edge modes can be obtained
analytically, as shown in [PRL 71, 3697 (1993)] and [PRA 89, 023619 (2014)]. We
put forward a method for obtaining the spectrum and wave functions of
topological edge modes for arbitrary finite lattices, including the
incommensurate case. A small number of parameters are easily determined
numerically, with the form of the eigenstates remaining fully analytical. We
also obtain the bulk modes in the finite system analytically and their
eigenenergies, which lie within the infinite-size limit continuum. Our method
is general and can be easily applied to obtain the properties of
non-topological models and/or extended to include impurities. As an example, we
consider the case of an impurity located next to one edge of a 1D system,
equivalent to a softened boundary in a separable 2D model. We show that a
localised impurity can have a drastic effect on the edge modes of the system.
Using the periodic Harper and Hofstadter models to illustrate our method, we
find that, on increasing the impurity strength, edge states can enter or exit
the continuum, and a trivial Shockley state bound to the impurity may appear.
The fate of the topological edge modes in the presence of impurities can be
addressed by quenching the impurity strength. We find that at certain critical
impurity strengths, the transition probability for a particle initially
prepared in an edge mode to decay into the bulk exhibits discontinuities that
mark the entry and exit points of edge modes from and into the bulk spectrum.

of misaligning the pre-collapse magnetic field with respect to the rotation
axis by performing four simulations: one aligned model and models with 15, 30,
and 45 degree misalignments. The simulations we present employ a microphysical
finite-temperature equation of state and a leakage scheme that captures the
overall energetics and lepton number exchange due to post-bounce neutrino
emission and absorption. We track the thermodynamic properties of the ejected
material with Lagrangian tracer particles and analyse its composition with the
nuclear reaction network SkyNet. By using different neutrino luminosities in
post-processing the tracer data with SkyNet, we constrain the impact of
uncertainties in neutrino luminosities. We find that, for the aligned model
considered here, the use of an approximate leakage scheme results in neutrino
luminosity uncertainties corresponding to a factor of 100-1000 uncertainty in
the abundance of third peak $r$-process elements. Our results show that for
misalignments of 30 degrees or less, $r$-process elements are robustly produced
as long as neutrino luminosities are reasonably low ($\lesssim 5 \times
10^{52}$ erg s$^{-1}$). For a more extreme misalignment of 45 degrees, we find
the production of $r$-process elements beyond the second peak significantly
reduced. We conclude that robust $r$-process nucleosynthesis in
magnetorotational supernovae requires a progenitor stellar core with a large
poloidal magnetic field component that is at least moderately (within $\sim 30$
degrees) aligned with the rotation axis.

interest owing to immense experimental progress in artifcial quantum systems.
Dynamical quantum measures such as the growth of entanglement entropy (EE) and
out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOCs) have been shown, theoretically, to
provide great insight by exposing subtle quantum features invisible to
traditional measures such as mass transport. However, measuring them in
experiments requires either identical copies of the system, an ancilla qubit
coupled to the whole system, or many measurements on a single copy, thereby
making scalability extremely complex and hence, severely limiting their
potential. Here, we introduce an alternate quantity $-$ the out-of-time-ordered
measurement (OTOM) $-$ which involves measuring a single observable on a single
copy of the system, while retaining the distinctive features of the OTOCs. We
show, theoretically, that OTOMs are closely related to OTOCs in a doubled
system with the same quantum statistical properties as the original system.
Using exact diagonalization, we numerically simulate classical mass transport,
as well as quantum dynamics through computations of the OTOC, the OTOM, and the
EE in quantum spin chain models in various interesting regimes (including
chaotic and many-body localized systems). Our results demonstrate that an OTOM
can successfully reveal subtle aspects of quantum dynamics hidden to classical
measures, and crucially, provide experimental access to them.

of altered consciousness during and after termination of mesial temporal lobe

(MI) measure with amplitude correlation (AC), phase synchronization (PS),
nonlinear correlation and coherence, and established MI as a robust measure of
synchronization. Next, we have extended MI to more than two signals by
principal component method. The extended MI was applied on intracranial

higher in the beginning or in the middle of the seizure than towards the offset
across the least involved channels in the same bands. Synchronization seems
built up outside the SOZ, gradually spread and culminated in SOZ and remained
high beyond offset leading to impaired consciousness in 82% of the complex

  Injection Attacks in the Smart Grid",,,,,"cs.SY cs.IT math.IT math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a novel graph-theoretic framework is proposed to generalize
the analysis of a broad set of security attacks, including observability and
data injection attacks, that target the state estimator of a smart grid. First,
the notion of observability attacks is defined based on a proposed
graph-theoretic construct. In this respect, a structured approach is proposed
to characterize critical sets, whose removal renders the system unobservable.
It is then shown that, for the system to be observable, these critical sets
must be part of a maximum matching over a proposed bipartite graph. In
addition, it is shown that stealthy data injection attacks (SDIAs) constitute a
special case of these observability attacks. Then, various attack strategies
and defense policies, for observability and data injection attacks, are shown
to be amenable to analysis using the introduced graph-theoretic framework. The
proposed framework is then shown to provide a unified basis for analysis of
four key security problems (among others), pertaining to the characterization
of: 1) The sparsest SDIA; 2) the sparsest SDIA including a certain measurement;
3) a set of measurements which must be defended to thwart all potential SDIAs;
and 4) the set of measurements, which when protected, can thwart any SDIA whose
cardinality is below a certain threshold. A case study using the IEEE 14-bus
system with a set of 17 measurements is used to support the theoretical
findings.

modelled at infrared, submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths, and it is one
of the nearest examples of the late stages of massive star formation in which
the newly formed star that ionizes it is still surrounded by vast amounts of
gas and dust. However, little is known about its heavily obscured central
source, S106IR. The possible binarity of the central source is investigated,
which is considered to be likely given the high binarity fraction among massive
stars. We have carried out visible and near-infrared photometric monitoring
looking for short-term variability, with special interest in that related to
the presence of a close binary companion to S106IR that may produce periodic
eclipses or tidal distortion of the shape of the members of the system. A
periodic variability of S106IR in the J band is found with a period of 5.0 days
and an amplitude of about 0.1 mag. The light curve displays a slow rise from
minimum to maximum followed by a steep decrease, and can be well reproduced by
a close binary system composed of two stars with different luminosity orbiting
each other in an elliptical orbit of moderate eccentricity. S106IR also shows
hints of short-term variability possibly related to accretion. We also report
variability of four other stars previously classified as members of the S106
cluster, all of which are strong X-ray emitters. The newly discovered close
binarity of S106IR adds a new element to the modeling of the nebula and to the
understanding of the dynamics of the gas around the ionizing source, which
suggests that the components of the binary are accreting via a circumbinary
disk. Binarity also helps to explain the apparent mismatch between the spectral
type of the ionizing source inferred from the nebular spectrum and its high

unprecedented contrast levels in the optical will provide astronomers with
their first direct look at mature, Jupiter sized planets at moderate

engineering developments, is used to compute maximum achievable signal-to-noise
ratios and scientifically viable integration times for hypothetical star planet
systems, as well as to investigate the constraining power of various
combinations of WFIRST-CGI photometric and spectral observations. This work
introduces two simple models for planetary geometric albedos, which are
inspired largely by the solar system's gas giants. The first planet model is a
hybrid Jupiter-Neptune model, which separately treats the short and long
wavelengths where chromophores and methane dominate absorption, respectively.
The second planet model fixes cloud and haze properties in CoolTLusty to match
Jupiter's albedo spectrum, it then perturbs only the metallicity. MCMC
retrievals performed on simulated observations are used to assess the precision
with which planet model parameters can be measured subject to different
exposure times and observing cases. Fit results for both models'
parameterizations of geometric albedo spectra demonstrate that a rough
indication of the metallicity or methane content should be possible for some
WFIRST-CGI targets. We conclude that real observations will likely be able to
differentiate between extreme cases using these models, but will lack the
precision necessary to uncover subtle trends.

development of QCD, the discovery of the J/$\Psi$ at BNL and SLAC and the clear
observation of high transverse momentum jets at the CERN SPS $\bar{p}+p$

superdense nuclear matter in the laboratory. This article discusses how
experimental methods and results which confirmed QCD at the first hadron

The resonant state of the proton-proton collision is successfully computed from
the extrapolation of $\Delta_\ell$ instead of the standard function. It is
shown that interpolating $\Delta_\ell$ can lead to useful extrapolation to
negative energies, provided scattering data are known below one nuclear Rydberg
energy (12.5 keV for the proton-proton system). This property is due to the
connection between $\Delta_\ell$ and the effective-range function by Hamilton
et al. that is discussed in detail. Nevertheless, such extrapolations to
negative energies should be used with caution because $\Delta_\ell$ is not
analytic at zero energy. The expected analytic properties of the main functions
are verified in the complex energy plane by graphical color-based
representations.

magnetic nature has been known for more than a century. Despite this, the

hitherto been solely defined by an intensity threshold. Here, we aim at
studying the magnetic nature of umbra-penumbra boundaries in sunspots of
different sizes, morphologies, evolutionary stages, and phases of the solar
cycle. We used a sample of 88 scans of the Hinode/SOT spectropolarimeter to
infer the magnetic field properties in at the umbral boundaries. We defined
these umbra-penumbra boundaries by an intensity threshold and performed a
statistical analysis of the magnetic field properties on these boundaries. We
statistically prove that the umbra-penumbra boundary in stable sunspots is
characterised by an invariant value of the vertical magnetic field component:
the vertical component of the magnetic field strength does not depend on the
umbra size, its morphology, and phase of the solar cycle. With the statistical
Bayesian inference, we find that the strength of the vertical magnetic field
component is, with a likelihood of 99\%, in the range of 1849-1885 G with the
most probable value of 1867 G. In contrast, the magnetic field strength and
inclination averaged along individual boundaries are found to be dependent on
the umbral size: the larger the umbra, the stronger and more horizontal the
magnetic field at its boundary. The umbra and penumbra of sunspots are
separated by a boundary that has hitherto been defined by an intensity
threshold. We now unveil the empirical law of the magnetic nature of the
umbra-penumbra boundary in stable sunspots: it is an invariant vertical
component of the magnetic field.

coupled with web-based authoring tools for creating annotatable videos and

the regulator permits a capital reduction due to diversification effect,
according to the typical subadditivity property of risk measures. However, once
the overall capital has been assessed no specific allocation formula is
provided or required in order to evaluate the contribution of each risk source

information about a target variable? When does a variable provide unique
information, when do variables share redundant information, and when do
variables combine synergistically to provide complementary information? The
redundancy lattice from the partial information decomposition of Williams and
Beer provided a promising glimpse at the answer to these questions. However,
this structure was constructed using a much criticised measure of redundant
information, and despite sustained research, no completely satisfactory
replacement measure has been proposed. In this paper, we take a different
approach, applying the axiomatic derivation of the redundancy lattice to a
single realisation from a set of discrete variables. To overcome the difficulty
associated with signed pointwise mutual information, we apply this
decomposition separately to the unsigned entropic components of pointwise
mutual information which we refer to as the specificity and ambiguity. This
yields a separate redundancy lattice for each component. Then based upon an
operational interpretation of redundancy, we define measures of redundant
specificity and ambiguity enabling us to evaluate the partial information atoms
in each lattice. These atoms can be recombined to yield the sought-after
multivariate information decomposition. We apply this framework to canonical
examples from the literature and discuss the results and the various properties
of the decomposition. In particular, the pointwise decomposition using
specificity and ambiguity satisfies a chain rule over target variables, which
provides new insights into the so-called two-bit-copy example.

lacks the basic security features such as massage authentication, which makes
it vulnerable to the spoofing attacks. In a CAN network, linking CAN packet to
the sender node is a challenging task. This paper aims to address this issue by
developing a framework to link each CAN packet to its source. Physical signal
attributes of the received packet consisting of channel and node (or device)
which contains specific unique artifacts are considered to achieve this goal.
Material and design imperfections in the physical channel and digital device,
which are the main contributing factors behind the device-channel specific
unique artifacts, are leveraged to link the received electrical signal to the
transmitter. Generally, the inimitable patterns of signals from each ECUs exist
over the course of time that can manifest the stability of the proposed method.
Uniqueness of the channel-device specific attributes are also investigated for
time- and frequency-domain. Feature vector is made up of both time and
frequency domain physical attributes and then employed to train a neural
network-based classifier. Performance of the proposed fingerprinting method is
evaluated by using a dataset collected from 16 different channels and four
identical ECUs transmitting same message. Experimental results indicate that
the proposed method achieves correct detection rates of 95.2% and 98.3% for

strongly affected by the strength of the quasi-disorder and the amplitude of
the $p$-wave pairing. We analyze the phase diagram of the polaron ground state
and find four phases: two extended phases, a weakly-localized phase and a
strongly-localized phase. It is remarkable that these polaron phases are
directly corresponding to the four distinct phases experienced by the
underlying background Fermi system. In particular, the weakly-localized polaron
phase corresponds to an intriguing critical phase of the Fermi system.
Therefore, the different phases of the background system can be unambiguously
probed by measuring the polaron properties via radio-frequency spectroscopy. We
also investigate the high-lying excited polaron states at an infinite

operation is defined for any number of possible transmitters. As in the model
recently introduced by Polyanskiy for the Multiple Access Channel (MAC) with a
fixed, known number of transmitters, the channel is assumed to be invariant to
permutations on its inputs, and all active transmitters employ identical
encoders. Unlike the Polyanskiy model, in the proposed scenario, neither the
transmitters nor the receiver knows which transmitters are active. We refer to
this agnostic communication setup as the Random Access Channel (RAC). Scheduled
feedback of a finite number of bits is used to synchronize the transmitters.
The decoder is tasked with determining from the channel output the number of
active transmitters, $k$, and their messages but not which transmitter sent
which message. The decoding procedure occurs at a time $n_t$ depending on the
decoder's estimate, $t$, of the number of active transmitters, $k$, thereby
achieving a rate that varies with the number of active transmitters. Single-bit
feedback at each time $n_i, i \leq t$, enables all transmitters to determine
the end of one coding epoch and the start of the next. The central result of
this work demonstrates the achievability on a RAC of performance that is
first-order optimal for the MAC in operation during each coding epoch. While
prior multiple access schemes for a fixed number of transmitters require $2^k -
1$ simultaneous threshold rules, the proposed scheme uses a single threshold
rule and achieves the same dispersion.

occurrence, the guesswork of each of them is their position in a list ordered
from most likely to least likely, breaking ties arbitrarily. Guesswork is
central to several applications in information theory: Average guesswork
provides a lower bound on the expected computational cost of a sequential
decoder to decode successfully the transmitted message; the complementary
cumulative distribution function of guesswork gives the error probability in
list decoding; the logarithm of guesswork is the number of bits needed in
optimal lossless one-to-one source coding; and guesswork is the number of
trials required of an adversary to breach a password protected system in a
brute-force attack. In this paper, we consider memoryless string-sources that
generate strings consisting of i.i.d. characters drawn from a finite alphabet,
and characterize their corresponding guesswork. Our main tool is the tilt
operation. We show that the tilt operation on a memoryless string-source
parametrizes an exponential family of memoryless string-sources, which we refer
to as the tilted family. We provide an operational meaning to the tilted
families by proving that two memoryless string-sources result in the same
guesswork on all strings of all lengths if and only if their respective
categorical distributions belong to the same tilted family. Establishing some
general properties of the tilt operation, we generalize the notions of weakly
typical set and asymptotic equipartition property to tilted weakly typical sets
of different orders. We use this new definition to characterize the large
deviations for all atypical strings and characterize the volume of weakly
typical sets of different orders. We subsequently build on this
characterization to prove large deviation bounds on guesswork and provide an
accurate approximation of its PMF.

e.g. suggest ways to reconcile inconsistent advice. This model naturally
represents the distinction between contradictions and disagreements. It is
based on the idea of representing natural language sentences as formulas with
parameters sitting on lattices, creating partial orders based on predicates
shared by theories, and building sheaves on these partial orders with products
of lattices as stalks. Degrees of disagreement are measured by the existence of
global and local sections.
  Limitations of the sheaf approach and connections to recent work in natural
language processing, as well as the topics of contextuality in physics, data

provides accurate estimates for aggregate queries using a small size sample,
and has been used widely for approximate query processing. A key question in
SRS is how to partition a target sample size among different strata. While
Neyman allocation provides a solution that minimizes the variance of an
estimate using this sample, it works under the assumption that each stratum is
abundant, i.e., has a large number of data points to choose from. This
assumption may not hold in general: one or more strata may be bounded, and may
not contain a large number of data points, even though the total data size may
be large.
  We first present VOILA, an offline method for allocating sample sizes to
strata in a variance-optimal manner, even for the case when one or more strata
may be bounded. We next consider SRS on streaming data that are continuously
arriving. We show a lower bound, that any streaming algorithm for SRS must have
(in the worst case) a variance that is {\Omega}(r) factor away from the
optimal, where r is the number of strata. We present S-VOILA, a practical
streaming algorithm for SRS that is locally variance-optimal in its allocation
of sample sizes to different strata. Our result from experiments on real and
synthetic data show that VOILA can have significantly (1.4 to 50.0 times)
smaller variance than Neyman allocation. The streaming algorithm S-VOILA
results in a variance that is typically close to VOILA, which was given the
entire input beforehand.

vision and natural language processing communities. Most existing approaches
adopt the pipeline of representing an image via pre-trained CNNs, and then
using the uninterpretable CNN features in conjunction with the question to
predict the answer. Although such end-to-end models might report promising
performance, they rarely provide any insight, apart from the answer, into the
VQA process. In this work, we propose to break up the end-to-end VQA into two
steps: explaining and reasoning, in an attempt towards a more explainable VQA
by shedding light on the intermediate results between these two steps. To that
end, we first extract attributes and generate descriptions as explanations for
an image using pre-trained attribute detectors and image captioning models,
respectively. Next, a reasoning module utilizes these explanations in place of
the image to infer an answer to the question. The advantages of such a
breakdown include: (1) the attributes and captions can reflect what the system
extracts from the image, thus can provide some explanations for the predicted
answer; (2) these intermediate results can help us identify the inabilities of
both the image understanding part and the answer inference part when the
predicted answer is wrong. We conduct extensive experiments on a popular VQA
dataset and dissect all results according to several measurements of the
explanation quality. Our system achieves comparable performance with the
state-of-the-art, yet with added benefits of explainability and the inherent
ability to further improve with higher quality explanations.

However, the 1D treatment is not enough to characterize quantum mechanical
correlations in the time-frequency behavior of multiple photons, such as the
biphotons from parametric down conversion. The two-dimensional treatment is
essentially required, but has not been fully demonstrated yet due to the
technical problem. Here, we study the two-dimensional (2D) time-frequency
duality duality of biphotons, by measuring two-photon distributions in both
frequency and time domains. It was found that generated biphotons satisfy the
Fourier limited condition quantum mechanically, but not classically, by
analyzing the time-bandwidth products in the 2D Fourier transform. Our study
provides an essential and deeper understanding of light beyond classical wave
optics, and opens up new possibilities for optical synthesis in a

  First, we show that a simple, greedy algorithm provides a 1.061-approximation

show that when agents have binary valuations over the goods, an exact solution

algorithm. Our results in the binary setting extend to provide novel, exact
algorithms for optimizing Nash social welfare under concave valuations.

probabilities for objects with only sky coordinates and proper motion, but can
also include parallax and radial velocity measurements, as well as
spectrophotometric distance constraints from sequences in color-magnitude or
spectral type-magnitude diagrams. BANYAN $\Sigma$ benefits from an analytical
solution to the Bayesian marginalization integrals that makes it more accurate

proposed to use different algorithms to reveal the distinctive features. Then,
we have reduced the number of dimensions using subspace methods. Finally, the
dimension of data is reduced in accordance with the classifier methods. After
this, the decision is determined by the best sores or combining some of the
best scores with matching fusion. The results have showed that the fusion
technique was successful. We have reached 97.71% for rank-1 with 567 test
probes. Furthermore, we have defined the perfect rank which is rank number when

error correcting code (ECC). ECCs may be optimized in a number of ways, for
instance by making them orthogonal. Here we test two types of orthogonal ECCs
on seven different datasets using three types of binary classifier and compare
them with three other multi-class methods: 1 vs. 1, one-versus-the-rest and
random ECCs. The first type of orthogonal ECC, in which the codes contain no
zeros, admits a fast and simple method of solving for the probabilities.
Orthogonal ECCs are always more accurate than random ECCs as predicted by
recent literature. Improvments in uncertainty coefficient (U.C.) range between
0.4--17.5% (0.004--0.139, absolute), while improvements in Brier score between
0.7--10.7%. Unfortunately, orthogonal ECCs are rarely more accurate than 1 vs.
1. Disparities are worst when the methods are paired with logistic regression,
with orthogonal ECCs never beating 1 vs. 1. When the methods are paired with
SVM, the losses are less significant, peaking at 1.5%, relative, 0.011 absolute
in uncertainty coefficient and 6.5% in Brier scores. Orthogonal ECCs are always
the fastest of the five multi-class methods when paired with linear
classifiers. When paired with a piecewise linear classifier, whose
classification speed does not depend on the number of training samples,
classifications using orthogonal ECCs were always more accurate than the other
methods and also faster than 1 vs. 1. Losses against 1 vs. 1 here were higher,
peaking at 1.9% (0.017, absolute), in U.C. and 39% in Brier score. Gains in
speed ranged between 1.1% and over 100%. Whether the speed increase is worth
the penalty in accuracy will depend on the application.

human characteristic biometric systems are used but because of inability of
traditional biometric systems to recognize twins, multimodal biometric systems
are developed. In this study a multimodal biometric recognition system is
proposed to recognize twins from each other and from the other people by using
image and speech data. The speech or image data can be enough to recognize
people from each other but twins cannot be distinguished with one of these
data. Therefore a robust recognition system with the combine of speech and ear
images is needed. As database, the photos and speech data of 39 twins are used.
For speech recognition MFCC and DTW algorithms are used. Also, Gabor filter and
DCVA algorithms are used for ear identification. Multi-biometrics success rate
is increased by making matching score level fusion. Especially, rank-5 is
reached 100%. We think that speech and ear can be complementary. Therefore, it
is result that multi-biometrics based speech and ear is effective for human

fine-grained recognition, one which recent methods using attention mechanisms
or second-order statistics fail to adequately address. Modern CNNs typically
lack an explicit understanding of object pose and are instead confused by
entangled pose and appearance. In this paper, we propose a unified object
representation built from a hierarchy of pose-aligned regions. Rather than
representing an object by regions aligned to image axes, the proposed
representation characterizes appearance relative to the object's pose using
pose-aligned patches whose features are robust to variations in pose, scale and
rotation. We propose an algorithm that performs pose estimation and forms the
unified object representation as the concatenation of hierarchical pose-aligned
regions features, which is then fed into a classification network. The proposed
algorithm surpasses the performance of other approaches, increasing the
state-of-the-art by nearly 2% on the widely-used CUB-200 dataset and by more
than 8% on the much larger NABirds dataset. The effectiveness of this paradigm
relative to competing methods suggests the critical importance of disentangling
pose and appearance for continued progress in fine-grained recognition.

receivers, each with some side information that can be utilized to reduce the
amount of communication from the server. Distributed index coding is an
extension of index coding in which the messages are broadcast from multiple
servers, each storing different subsets of the messages. In this paper, the
optimal tradeoff among the message rates and the server broadcast rates, which
is defined formally as the capacity region, is studied for a general
distributed index coding problem. Inner and outer bounds on the capacity region
are established that have matching sum-rates for all 218 non-isomorphic
four-message problems with equal link capacities for all the links from servers
to receivers. The proposed inner bound is built on a distributed composite
coding scheme that outperforms the existing schemes by incorporating more
flexible decoding configurations and enhanced fractional rate allocations into
two-stage composite coding, a scheme that was originally introduced for
centralized index coding. The proposed outer bound is built on the
polymatroidal axioms of entropy, as well as functional dependences such as the
$\rm{fd}$-separation introduced by the multi-server nature of the problem. This
outer bound utilizes general groupings of servers with different levels of
granularity, which allows a natural tradeoff between computational complexity
and tightness of the bound, and includes and improves upon all existing outer
bounds for distributed index coding. Specific features of the proposed inner

Computational models of the underlying physical processes, such as classical
N-body simulations, are extremely resource intensive, as they track the action
of gravity in an expanding universe using billions of particles as tracers of
the cosmic matter distribution. Therefore, upcoming cosmology experiments will
face a computational bottleneck that may limit the exploitation of their full
scientific potential. To address this challenge, we demonstrate the application
of a machine learning technique called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to
learn models that can efficiently generate new, physically realistic
realizations of the cosmic web. Our training set is a small, representative
sample of 2D image snapshots from N-body simulations of size 500 and 100 Mpc.
We show that the GAN-generated samples are qualitatively and quantitatively
very similar to the originals. For the larger boxes of size 500 Mpc, it is very
difficult to distinguish them visually. The agreement of the power spectrum
$P_k$ is 1-2\% for most of the range, between $k=0.06$ and $k=0.4$. An
important advantage of generating cosmic web realizations with a GAN is the
considerable gains in terms of computation time. Each new sample generated by a
GAN takes a fraction of a second, compared to the many hours needed by
traditional N-body techniques. We anticipate that the use of generative models
such as GANs will therefore play an important role in providing extremely fast
and precise simulations of cosmic web in the era of large cosmological surveys,

of the possible action classes do not occur in the training data. Our approach
is based on modeling each action class using a probability distribution whose
parameters are functions of the attribute vector representing that action
class. In particular, we assume that the distribution parameters for any action
class in the visual space can be expressed as a linear combination of a set of
basis vectors where the combination weights are given by the attributes of the
action class. These basis vectors can be learned solely using labeled data from
the known (i.e., previously seen) action classes, and can then be used to
predict the parameters of the probability distributions of unseen action
classes. We consider two settings: (1) Inductive setting, where we use only the
labeled examples of the seen action classes to predict the unseen action class
parameters; and (2) Transductive setting which further leverages unlabeled data
from the unseen action classes. Our framework also naturally extends to
few-shot action recognition where a few labeled examples from unseen classes
are available. Our experiments on benchmark datasets (UCF101, HMDB51 and
Olympic) show significant performance improvements as compared to various
baselines, in both standard zero-shot (disjoint seen and unseen classes) and

training samples that are consistently misclassified. Our overall contribution
is therefore twofold. First, while most existing algorithms treat data equally
and have a strong appetite for more data, we demonstrate in contrast that an
individual datum can sometimes have disproportionate and counterproductive
influence and that it is not always better to train neural networks with more
data. Next, we consider more thoughtful strategies by taking into account the
geometric and topological properties of natural-image spaces to which deep
networks are applied.

accuracy ever achieved. Using their range measurements many geophysical
parameters were calculated and some General Relativity effects were directly
observed. To obtain precise and refined measurements of the effects due to the
predictions of General Relativity on the orbit of these satellites, it is
mandatory to model with high precision and accuracy all other forces, reducing
the free parameters introduced in the orbit determination. A main category of
non-gravitational forces to be considered are those of thermal origin, whose
fine modeling strongly depends on the knowledge of the evolution of the spin
vector. We present a complete model, named LASSOS, to describe the evolution of
the spin of the LAGEOS and LARES satellites. In particular, we solved Euler
equations of motion considering not-averaged torques. This is the most general
case, and the predictions of the model well fit the available observations of
the satellites spin. We also present the predictions of our model in the
fast-spin limit, based on the application of averaged equations. The results
are in good agreement with those already published, but with our approach we
have been able to highlight small errors within these previous works. LASSOS
was developed within the LARASE research program. LARASE aims to improve the
dynamical model of the two LAGEOS and LARES satellites to provide very precise
and accurate measurements of relativistic effects on their orbit, and also to
bring benefits to geophysics and space geodesy.

$\alpha$-entropy is a generalization of the usual relative entropy (or the

research is an urgent need. In this paper we present an efficient mechanism to
solve the problem of web service composition. For the given request, a service
dependency graph is firstly generated with the relevant services picked from an
external repository. Then, each search step on the graph is transformed into a
dynamic knapsack problem by mapping services to items whose volume and cost is
changeable, after which a knapsack-variant algorithm is applied to solve each
problem after transformation. Once the last search step is completed, the
minimal composition that satisfies the request can be obtained. Experiments on

exploited by deep networks for image classification, focusing on single images;
no effort has been spent in investigating whether these patterns are

the image class the network has realized. This paper goes in this direction,
presenting a visualization framework which produces a group of clusters or
summaries, each one formed by crisp salient image regions focusing on a
particular part that the network has exploited with high regularity to decide
for a given class. The approach is based on a sparse optimization step
providing sharp image saliency masks that are clustered together by means of a
semantic flow similarity measure. The summaries communicate clearly what a
network has exploited of a particular image class, and this is proved through
automatic image tagging and with a user study. Beyond the deep network
understanding, summaries are also useful for many quantitative reasons: their
number is correlated with ability of a network to classify (more summaries,
better performances), and they can be used to improve the classification
accuracy of a network through summary-driven specializations.

study the brain's modular structure. Recent studies indicated that certain
brain regions are known to interact with multiple subnetworks. However, most
existing methods are mainly for non-overlapping subnetwork extraction. In this
paper, we present an approach for overlapping brain subnetwork extraction using
cliques, which we defined as co-activated node groups performing multiple
tasks. We proposed a multisource subnetwork extraction approach based on the
co-activated clique, which (1) uses task co-activation and task connectivity
strength information for clique identification, (2) automatically detects
cliques of different sizes having more neuroscientific justifications, and (3)
shares the subnetwork membership, derived from a fusion of rest and task data,
among the nodes within a clique for overlapping subnetwork extraction. On real
data, compared to the commonly used overlapping community detection techniques,
we showed that our approach improved subnetwork extraction in terms of
group-level and subject-wise reproducibility. We also showed that our
multisource approach identified subnetwork overlaps within brain regions that
matched well with hubs defined using functional and anatomical information,
which enables us to study the interactions between the subnetworks and how hubs
play their role in information flow across different subnetworks. We further
demonstrated that the assignments of interacting/individual nodes using our
approach correspond with the posterior probability derived independently from
our multimodal random walker based approach.

agreed best with the LES model results. Although RANS Reynolds stress transport

unable to capture velocity fluctuations. RANS shear stress transport (SST)
k-{\omega} model and DES models were unable to predict the location of high

in tidally deformed neutron stars in coalescing binaries has been studied in
some detail. The result is significant because it could influence the inspiral
and leave an imprint on the gravitational wave signal that depends on the
neutron star equation of state (EOS). Because of its potential importance, the
details of the instability should be further elucidated and its sensitivity to
the EOS should be investigated. To this end, we carry out a numerical analysis
with six representative EOSs for both static and non-static tides. We confirm
that the absence of the p-g instability under static tides, as well as its
return under non-static tides, is generic across EOSs, and further reveal a new
contribution to it that becomes important for moderately high-order p-g pairs
(previous studies concentrated on very high order modes), whose associated
coupling strength can vary by factors of ~10-100 depending on the EOS. We find
that, for stars with stiffer EOSs and smaller buoyancy frequencies, the
instability onsets earlier in the inspiral and the unstable modes grow faster.
These results suggest that the instability's impact on the gravitational wave
signal might be sensitive to the neutron star EOS. To fully assess this
prospect, future studies will need to investigate its saturation as a function
of the EOS and the binary parameters.

$\Lambda$ of a finite-dimensional $1$-based Banach space $A$ extends to a base
preserving $\varepsilon$-isometry $\bar f:A\to\mathbb U_K$ of the based Banach

$\mathfrak{FI}_K$-universal based Banach space exists for $K>1$.
  The Banach space $\mathbb U_K$ is isomorphic to the complementably universal
Banach space for the class of Banach spaces with an unconditional Schauder
basis, constructed by Pe\l czy\'nski in 1969.

ground state and inter-layer coupling and observe a field-induced metamagnetic
transition. The metamagnetic transition results in magnetoresistances of 95%,

the spectral tau approach which is valid for large Reynolds and Peclet numbers,

to participate in it? In this paper, we investigate how social image concerns
affect women's decision to compete. We first construct a theoretical model and
show that participating in a competition, even under affirmative action
policies favoring women, is costly for women under public observability since
it deviates from traditional female gender norms, resulting in women's low
appearance in competitive environments. We propose and theoretically show that
introducing prosocial incentives in the competitive environment is effective
and robust to public observability since (i) it induces women who are
intrinsically motivated by prosocial incentives to the competitive environment
and (ii) it makes participating in a competition not costly for women from
social image point of view. We conduct a laboratory experiment where we
randomly manipulate the public observability of decisions to compete and test
our theoretical predictions. The results of the experiment are fairly
consistent with our theoretical predictions. We suggest that when designing
policies to promote gender equality in competitive environments, using
prosocial incentives through company philanthropy or other social
responsibility policies, either as substitutes or as complements to traditional
affirmative action policies, could be promising.

  addendum with material written subsequent to submission is included in v2",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The mainstream view of meaning is that it is emergent, not fundamental, but
some have disputed this, asserting that there is a more fundamental level of
reality than that addressed by current physical theories, and that matter and
meaning are in some way entangled. In this regard there are intriguing
parallels between the quantum and biological domains, suggesting that there may
be a more fundamental level underlying both. I argue that the organisation of
this fundamental level is already to a considerable extent understood by
biosemioticians, who have fruitfully integrated Peirce's sign theory into
biology; things will happen there resembling what happens with familiar life,
but the agencies involved will differ in ways reflecting their fundamentality,
in other words they will be less complex, but still have structures complex
enough for what they have to do. According to one approach involving a
collaboration with which I have been involved, a part of what they have to do,
along with the need to survive and reproduce, is to stop situations becoming
too chaotic, a concept that accords with familiar 'edge of chaos' ideas. Such
an extension of sign theory (semiophysics?) needs to be explored by physicists,
possible tools being computational models, existing insights into complexity,
and dynamical systems theory. Such a theory will not be mathematical in the
same way that conventional physics theories are mathematical: rather than being
foundational, mathematics will be 'something that life does', something that
sufficiently evolved life does because in the appropriate context so doing is
of value to life.

Improving it in higher education is extremely important not only for the
scientific production generated by university but also for the adequacy of the
training that future graduates will be offered; professionals facing an
increasingly demanding labour market with new needs. University teachers
training, thus, should be a priority in academic policies due to their
influence and the role played in the evolution of society, as well as being the
basis of the quality of Higher Education. This research, a case study in the
State of Goias (Brazil), is focused on a sample of practicing university
teachers from different fields of knowledge, and has as main objective to know
the characteristics of the training received for their professional practice,
both in the field of scientific education and their educational role and
ability to transfer knowledge. The methodology used has been mixed, not
experimental and descriptive, with the help of instruments for data collection
and analysis of quantitative and qualitative nature (questionnaires,
interviews, monitoring, checklists, documentary analysis, etc.). The results
confirmed the initial hypothesis, which stated that university teachers current
training is primarily scientific and technical, and has gaps in the teacher
training required today for a more effective work in the classroom. In this
area teachers often use teaching methodologies supported by previous
experiences with traditional features. Finally, to optimize this situation,
different strategies for university teachers training are proposed seeking to
improve both their reflection and teaching practice.

  paper in arXiv",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dopability in semiconductors plays a crucial role in device performance.
Using the first-principles density-functional theory calculations, we
investigate systematically the doping properties of layered MX2 (M= Mo, W; X=S,
Te) by replacing M or X with the groups III, V and VII elements. It is found
that the defect BM is hard to form in MX2 due to the large formation energy
originating from the crystal distortion, while AlM is easy to realize compared
to the former. In MoS2, WS2 and MoTe2, Al is the most desirable p-type dopant
under anion-rich conditions among the group III components, since AlM has
relatively low transition and formation energies. With respect to the doping of
the group V elements, it is found that the substitutions on the cation sites
have deeper defect levels than those on the anion sites due to the strong
electronegativity. AsTe and SbTe in MoTe2 and WTe2 are trend to form shallow
acceptors under cation-rich conditions, indicating high hole-concentrations for
p-type doping, whereas SbS in MoS2 and PTe in WTe2 are shown to be good p-type
candidates under cation-rich conditions. In despite of that the substitutions
of group VII on X site have low formation energies, the transition energies are
too high to achieve n-type MoS2 and WS2. Nevertheless, for MoTe2, the
substitutions with the group VII elements on the anion sites are suitable for
n-type doping on account of the shallow donor levels and low formation energies
under Mo-rich condition. As to WTe2, F is the only potential donor due to the
shallow transition energy of FTe. Our findings of filtering out unfavorable and
identifying favorable dopants in MX2 are very valuable for experimental
implementations.
