of a polar material resulting from the coupling of light with optic phonons -
offer immense technological opportunities for nanophotonics in the infrared
(IR) spectral region. Here, we present a novel approach to overcome the major
limitation of SPhPs, namely the narrow, material-specific spectral range where
SPhPs can be supported, called the Reststrahlen band. We use an atomic-scale
superlattice (SL) of two polar semiconductors, GaN and AlN, to create a hybrid
material featuring layer thickness-tunable optic phonon modes. As the IR
dielectric function is governed by the optic phonon behavior, such control
provides a means to create a new dielectric function distinct from either
constituent material and to tune the range over which SPhPs can be supported.
This work offers the first glimpse of the guiding principles governing the
degree to which the dielectric function can be designed using this approach.

scale can be found in the average internal dynamics of galaxies. The existence
of such a scale is not obvious as far as the standard cosmological model is
concerned, and it has been interpreted as a possible sign of modified gravity.
The implications could be profound: it could in principle explain galactic
dynamics without large amounts of yet-undetected dark matter and address issues
that the standard cosmological model faces at galactic scales. Here, we
consider 193 disk galaxies from the SPARC and THINGS databases and, using
Bayesian inference, we show that the probability of existence of a fundamental
acceleration that is common to all the galaxies is essentially zero: the
$p$-value is smaller than $10^{-20}$ or, equivalently, the null hypothesis is
rejected at more than 10$\sigma$. We conclude that the acceleration scale
unveiled by the Radial Acceleration Relation is of emergent nature, possibly
caused by a complex interplay between baryons and dark matter. In particular,
the MOND theory, or any other theory that behaves like it at galactic scales,
is ruled out as a fundamental theory for galaxies at more than 10$\sigma$.

biomolecules where atoms interact via short-range harmonic potentials, provide
great insight into a molecule's internal dynamics and mechanical properties at
extremely low computational cost. Their efficiency and effectiveness have made
them a pivotal instrument in the computer-aided study of proteins and, since a
few years, also of nucleic acids. In general, the coarse-grained sites, i.e.
those effective force centres onto which the all-atom structure is mapped, are
constructed based on intuitive rules: a typical choice for proteins is to
retain only the C$_\alpha$ atoms of each amino acid. However, a mapping
strategy relying only on the atom type and not the local properties of its
embedding can be suboptimal compared to a more careful selection. Here we
present a strategy in which the subset of atoms, each of which is mapped onto a
unique coarse-grained site of the model, is selected in a stochastic search
aimed at optimising a cost function. The latter is taken to be a simple measure
of the consistency between the harmonic approximation of an elastic network
model and the harmonic model obtained through exact integration of the
discarded degrees of freedom. The method is applied to two representatives of
structurally very different types of biomolecules: the protein Adenylate kinase
and the RNA molecule adenine riboswitch. Our analysis quantifies the
substantial impact that an algorithm-driven selection of coarse-grained sites

  Gravitationally Lensed Sources and Characterization of their Structure,
  Stellar Populations, and Line Emission","Accepted to ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aacd4d",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quiescent galaxies at $z \gtrsim 2$ are compact and have weak or absent
emission lines, making it difficult to spatially resolve their kinematics and
stellar populations using ground-based spectroscopy. Gravitationally lensed
examples provide a promising route forward, but such objects are very rare. We
describe a search in the fields of 232 galaxy clusters that has uncovered five
bright ($H_{\rm AB} < 20$) lensed galaxies with red near-infrared colors. These
include MRG-M0138, the brightest lensed galaxy known in the near-infrared.
Analysis of near-infrared spectra and multiband photometry confirms that all
are quiescent galaxies at z=1.95-2.64 with stellar ages of 0.5-1.4 Gyr
(corresponding to formation epochs $z_{\rm form} \simeq 3-4$) and stellar
masses of $10^{11.6-12.8} \mu^{-1} M_{\odot}$, where $\mu$ is the
magnification. In three cases we derive lens models and reconstruct the source
structure; these galaxies are massive ($M_* \gtrsim 10^{11.0} M_{\odot}$) and
follow the mass--size relation defined by unlensed samples. In two of these
three galaxies, the main structural component is an inclined disk. Weak
emission lines are detected in four of five galaxies with high ratios
[NII]/H$\alpha$~2-6 that are inconsistent with a star formation origin. Based
on the line ratios, the H$\alpha$ equivalent widths, and the distribution and
kinematics of the gas, we infer that shocks are likely present in at least two
galaxies and could be present in all of the line emitters. We speculate that
these could be analogs of local galaxies in which AGN jet-driven outflows are
thought to heat the interstellar medium and suppress star formation. In further
papers we will present spatially resolved measurements of the stellar
populations and kinematics of this unique sample.

of galaxies. At high redshifts, spatially resolving the stellar kinematics of
quiescent galaxies is challenging due to their compact sizes. Using deep
near-infrared spectroscopy, we have measured the resolved stellar kinematics of
four quiescent galaxies at z=1.95-2.64, introduced in Paper I, that are
gravitationally lensed by galaxy clusters. Analyses of two of these have
previously been reported individually by Newman et al. and Toft et al., and for
the latter we present new observations. All four galaxies show significant
rotation and can be classified as ""fast rotators."" In the three systems for
which the lensing constraints permit a reconstruction of the source, we find
that all are likely to be highly flattened (intrinsic ellipticities of
$\approx0.75-0.85$) disk-dominated galaxies with rapid rotation speeds of
$V_{\rm max}=290-352$ km/s and predominantly rotational support, as indicated
by the ratio $(V/\sigma)_{R_e}=1.7-2.3$. Compared to coeval star-forming
galaxies of similar mass, the quiescent galaxies have smaller $V/\sigma$. Given
their high masses $M_{\rm dyn} \gtrsim 2\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$, we argue that
these galaxies are likely to evolve into ""slow rotator"" elliptical galaxies
whose specific angular momentum is reduced by a factor of 5-10. This provides
strong evidence for merger-driven evolution of massive galaxies after
quenching. Consistent with indirect evidence from earlier morphological
studies, our small but unique sample suggests that the kinematic
transformations that produced round, dispersion-supported elliptical galaxies
were not generally coincident with quenching. Such galaxies probably emerged
later via mergers that increased their masses and sizes while also eroding
their rotational support.

around super-Jovian extrasolar planets. These planets are abundant at about 1
AU from Sun-like stars, which makes their putative moons interesting for
studies of habitability. Technological advances could soon make an exomoon
discovery with Kepler or the upcoming CHEOPS and PLATO space missions possible.
Exomoon climates might be substantially different from exoplanet climates
because the day-night cycles on moons are determined by the moon's synchronous
rotation with its host planet. Moreover, planetary illumination at the top of
the moon's atmosphere and tidal heating at the moon's surface can be
substantial, which can affect the redistribution of energy on exomoons. Using
an idealized general circulation model with simplified hydrologic, radiative,
and convective processes, we calculate surface temperature, wind speed, mean
meridional circulation, and energy transport on a 2.5 Mars-mass moon orbiting a
10-Jupiter-mass at 1 AU from a Sun-like star. The strong thermal irradiation
from a young giant planet causes the satellite's polar regions to warm, which
remains consistent with the dynamically-driven polar amplification seen in
Earth models that lack ice-albedo feedback. Thermal irradiation from young,
luminous giant planets onto water-rich exomoons can be strong enough to induce
water loss on a planet, which could lead to a runaway greenhouse. Moons that
are in synchronous rotation with their host planet and do not experience a
runaway greenhouse could experience substantial polar melting induced by the
polar amplification of planetary illumination and geothermal heating from tidal
effects.

others. The new schema is based on Linked Data, and it reuses other schemata
obtaining a better and more complete definition of the services. In order to
validate the completeness of the scheme, a series of data mining services have
been created where a set of algorithms such as Random Forest or K-Means are
modeled as services. In addition, a dataset has been generated including the
definition of the services of several actual Cloud Computing data mining
providers, confirming the effectiveness of the schema.

Pre-recombination PMFs are dissipated during recombination and reionization via
decaying MHD turbulence and ambipolar diffusion. This modifies the local matter
and electron temperatures and thus affects the ionization history and Thomson
visibility function. We use this effect to constrain PMFs described by a
spectrum of power-law type, extending our previous study (based on a
scale-invariant spectrum) to arbitrary spectral index. We derive upper bounds
on the integrated amplitude of PMFs due to the separate effect of ambipolar
diffusion and MHD decaying turbulence and their combination. We show that
ambipolar diffusion is relevant for $n_{\rm B}>0$ whereas for $n_{\rm B}<0$ MHD
turbulence is more important. The bound marginalized over the spectral index on
the integrated amplitude of PMFs with a sharp cut-off is $\sqrt{\langle B^2

chirality. Using a scattering theory approach, we study the skew scattering
induced by the scattering processes that involve two magnetic moments and a
non-magnetic impurity, which is proportional to the vector spin chirality of
the spins in the vicinity of the non-magnetic impurity. Furthermore, we show
that a finite vector spin chirality naturally exists around an impurity in the
usual ferromagnetic metals at finite temperature due to the local
inversion-symmetry breaking by the impurity. The result is potentially relevant
to magnetic oxides which the anomalous Hall effect is enhanced at finite

  We have first derived the absorption affecting the different regions of the
galaxy. Then, we applied an automatic and objective searching method over the

result with the construction of the stellar density map for the blue young
population. A statistical procedure to decontaminate the photometric diagrams

main characteristics, including coordinates, sizes, estimated number of

distances. We observed these groups delineate different structures of the
galaxy, and they are the last step in the hierarchical way in which the young
population is organized. From their size distribution, we found they have
typical radius of $\sim 40 - 50$ pc. These values are consistent with those

exponentially (power-law) in the product of the spin-orbit interaction (SOI)
wavevector and the QD length. If the barrier between the two sections is
removed, the $g$-factor of the emerging Andreev bound states is suppressed less
strongly. In the strong SOI regime and if the chemical potential is tuned to
the SOI energy in both sections, the $g$-factor saturates to a universal
constant. Remarkably, the effective $g$-factor shows a pronounced peak at the
SOI energy as function of the chemical potentials. In addition, if the SOI is
uniform, the $g$-factor renormalization as a function of the chemical potential
is given by a universal dependence which is independent of the QD size. This
prediction provides a powerful tool to determine experimentally whether the SOI
in the whole NW is uniform and, moreover, gives direct access to the SOI
strengths of the NW via $g$-factor measurements. In addition, it allows one to
find the optimum position of the chemical potential for bringing the NW into

of variability are likely caused by a two-armed spiral density perturbation in
the Be disk. The intensity ratios of the double emission peaks are also
phase-locked, possibly indicating heating by the sdOB star of the side of the

qubit is treated independently, we identify signatures of influence of common
part of the bath on the two qubits. At large interqubit distances, this common

caused by it can be modeled by considering multiple uncorrelated sources of

Consequently, the resulting genuinely two-qubit contribution to decoherence can
be described as being caused by classical Gaussian noise. On the other hand,
for small interqubit distances the common part of the environment contains
clusters of spins that are strongly coupled to both qubits, and their
contribution to two-qubit dephasing has visibly non-Gaussian character. We show
that one van easily obtain information about non-Gaussianity of environmental

observation with $AstroSat$/CZT Imager (CZTI) also provides the polarisation
which helps in constraining different prompt emission models using the novel
joint spectra-polarimetric data. We analyze the $Fermi$/GBM data, and find two
main bursting episodes that are clearly separated in time, one particularly
faint in higher energies and having certain differences in their spectra. The
spectrum in general shows a hard-to-soft evolution in both the episodes. Only
the later part of the first episode shows intensity tracking behaviour
corresponding to multiple pulses. The photon index of the spectrum is hard, and
in over 90 per cent cases, cross even the slow cooling limit ($\alpha=-2/3$) of
an optically thin synchrotron shock model (SSM). Though such hard values are
generally associated with a sub-dominant thermal emission, such a component is
not statistically required in our analysis. In addition, the measured
polarisation in 100--300\,keV is too high, $\pi=85\pm29\%$, to be accommodated
in such a scenario. Jitter radiation, which allows a much harder index up to
$\alpha=+0.5$, in principle can produce high polarisation but only beyond the
spectral peak, which in our case lies close to $200~-~300$ keV during the time

Having expanded for nearly a year, the merger remnant is expected to subtend
roughly 5 milli-arcseconds (mas) on the sky, potentially resolvable by very
long baseline radio imaging techniques. Any observations revealing the radio
centroid to be offset from the line-of-site to the merger would be the smoking
gun of a jetted outflow. However, our results indicate that a measurement of
the centroid position alone cannot independently determine whether that jet
escaped successfully from the merger debris cloud, or was ""choked,"" yielding a
quasi-spherical explosion. We find that in both scenarios, the centroid
exhibits superluminal proper motion away from the merger site at roughly 4 - 10
mas per day for at least the first 300 days. We argue that a successful
strategy for differentiating among the explosion models will need to include
multiple observations over the coming months - years. In particular, we find
the time at which the centroid attains its maximum offset, and begins heading
back toward the merger site, is considerably later if the jet was choked.
Detecting a reversal of the centroid trajectory earlier than 600 days would
uniquely identify a successful jet. Our results indicate the source might be
resolved using VLBI radio observing techniques with roughly 1 mas resolution
starting at roughly 400 days post-merger, and that the the angular extent of a
successful jet is significantly smaller than that of a choked jet (4.5 versus 7
mas respectively).

X-ray detected system in the mass range of typical progenitors of today's
massive clusters. The 870$\mu$m map reveals six F$_{870\mu m}$ > 0.5 mJy
sources spread over an area of 0.07 arcmin$^2$, giving an overdensity of a
factor ~10 (6) with respect to blank field counts down to F$_{870\mu m}$ > 1
(0.5) mJy. On the other hand, deep CO(4-3) follow-up confirms membership of
three of these sources, but suggests that the remaining three, including the
brightest 870$\mu$m sources in the field (F$_{870\mu m}\gtrsim$2 mJy), are
likely interlopers. The measurement of 870$\mu$m continuum and CO(4-3) line
fluxes at the positions of previously-known cluster members provides a deep
probe of dusty star formation occurring in the core of this high-redshift
structure, adding up to a total SFR~700$\pm$100 M$_{\odot}$/yr and yielding an
integrated star formation rate density of ~10$^4$ M$_{\odot}$/yr/Mpc$^3$, five
orders of magnitude larger than in the field at the same epoch, due to the
concentration of star-forming galaxies in the small volume of the dense cluster
core. The combination of these observations with previously available HST
imaging highlights the presence in this same volume of a population of galaxies
with already suppressed star formation. This diverse composition of galaxy
populations in ClJ1449+0856 is especially highlighted at the very cluster
center, where a complex assembly of quiescent and star-forming sources is
likely forming the future Brightest Cluster Galaxy.

applying our method to an independent sample of $\sim$100 ALMA-identified SMGs

the distribution of mass in our Universe. As they arise from the highest peaks
in the matter density field, the spatial distribution of luminous objects is
biased towards those peaks. On large scales, where density fluctuations are
mild, this bias simply amounts to a constant offset in the clustering amplitude
of the tracer, known as linear bias. In this work we focus on the relative bias
between galaxies and galaxy clusters that are located inside and in the
vicinity of cosmic voids, extended regions of relatively low density in the
large-scale structure of the Universe. With the help of hydro-dynamical
simulations we verify that the relation between galaxy and cluster overdensity
around voids remains linear. Hence, the void-centric density profiles of
different tracers can be linked by a single multiplicative constant. This
amounts to the same value as the relative linear bias between tracers for the
largest voids in the sample. For voids of small sizes, which typically arise in
higher density regions, this constant has a higher value, possibly showing an
environmental dependence similar to that observed for the linear bias itself.
We confirm our findings by analysing mocks and data obtained during the first
year of observations by the Dark Energy Survey. As a side product, we present
the first catalogue of three-dimensional voids extracted from a photometric
survey with a controlled photo-z uncertainty. Our results will be relevant in
forthcoming analyses that attempt to use voids as cosmological probes.

introduced fields share an odd charge under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ parity symmetry.
This model, commonly known as ""Scotogenic"", was designed to provide a mechanism
for active neutrino mass generation as well as a viable dark matter candidate.
In this paper we consider a scenario in which the dark matter particle is at
the keV-scale. Such particle is free from X-ray limits due to the unbroken
parity symmetry that forbids the mixing between active and right-handed
neutrinos. The active neutrino masses are radiatively generated from the new
scalars and the two heavier right-handed states with $\sim \mathcal{O}(100)$
GeV masses. These heavy fermions can produce the observed baryon asymmetry of
the Universe through the combination of Akhmedov-Rubakov-Smirnov mechanism and
recently proposed scalar decays. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first time that these two mechanisms are shown to be successful in any
radiative model. We identify the parameter space where the successful
leptogenesis is compatible with the observed abundance of dark matter as well
as the measurements from the neutrino oscillation experiments. Interestingly,
combining dark matter production and successful leptogenesis gives rise to
strict limits from big bang nucleosynthesis which do not allow the mass of dark
matter to lie above $\sim 10$ keV, providing a phenomenological hint for
considered low-scale dark matter. By featuring the keV-scale dark matter free
from stringent X-ray limits, successful baryon asymmetry generation and
non-zero active neutrino masses, the model is a direct analogue to the $\nu$MSM
model proposed by Asaka, Blanchet and Shaposhnikov. Therefore we dub the
presented framework as ""The new $\nu$MSM"" abbreviated as $\nu\nu$MSM.

the interstellar medium of galaxies reaches energetic equipartition despite the

to thread the inter-galactic medium. Previous numerical studies of isolated
galaxies suggest that a fast dynamo amplification might suffice to bridge the
gap spanning many orders of magnitude in strength between the weak early
Universe magnetic fields and the ones observed in high redshift galaxies. To
better understand their evolution in the cosmological context of hierarchical
galaxy growth, we probe the amplification process undergone by the cosmic
magnetic field within a spiral galaxy to unprecedented accuracy by means of a
suite of constrained transport magnetohydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement
cosmological zoom simulations with different stellar feedback prescriptions. A
galactic turbulent dynamo is found to be naturally excited in this cosmological
environment, being responsible for most of the amplification of the magnetic
energy. Indeed, we find that the magnetic energy spectra of simulated galaxies
display telltale inverse cascades. Overall, the amplification process can be
divided in three main phases, which are related to different physical
mechanisms driving galaxy evolution: an initial collapse phase, an
accretion-driven phase, and a feedback-driven phase. While different feedback
models affect the magnetic field amplification differently, all tested models
prove to be subdominant at early epochs, before the feedback-driven phase is
reached. Thus the three-phase evolution paradigm is found to be quite robust
vis-a-vis feedback prescriptions.

outside of mean motion resonances at 4Gyr, which differs from previous results
obtained in the exact coplanar case with Neptune being treated as a quadrupole

in N-body simulations. We find that a near coplanar Planet Nine can flip TNO
orbital planes, and when this happens, the geometrical longitudes of pericenter
of the TNOs librate around $180^\circ$ during the flip. Orbital precession
caused by the inner giant planets can suppress the flips while keeping the
longitude of pericenter librating when $30\lesssim r_p \lesssim 80$ AU $\&$
$a\gtrsim 250$ AU. This results in the alignment of the pericenter of the low

modeling of stars with a convective core, based on gravity-mode oscillations.
These probe the near-core region in the deep stellar interior. The modeling
relies on a set of observed high-precision oscillation frequencies of
low-degree coherent gravity modes with long lifetimes and their observational
uncertainties. Identification of the mode degree and azimuthal order is assumed
to be achieved from rotational splitting and/or from period spacing patterns.
This paper has two major outcomes. The first is a comprehensive list and
discussion of the major uncertainties of theoretically predicted gravity-mode
oscillation frequencies based on linear pulsation theory, caused by fixing
choices of the input physics for evolutionary models. Guided by a hierarchy
among these uncertainties of theoretical frequencies, we subsequently provide a
global methodological scheme to achieve forward asteroseismic modeling. We
properly take into account correlations amongst the free parameters included in
stellar models. Aside from the stellar mass, metalicity and age, the major
parameters to be estimated are the near-core rotation rate, the amount of
convective core overshooting, and the level of chemical mixing in the radiative
zones. This modeling scheme allows for maximum likelihood estimation of the
stellar parameters for fixed input physics of the equilibrium models, followed
by stellar model selection considering various choices of the input physics.
Our approach uses the Mahalanobis distance instead of the often used $\chi^2$
statistic and includes heteroscedasticity. It provides estimation of the

curator selects seeds, or original resources, which are then captured by an
archiving system and stored as archived web pages, or mementos. The systems
that build web archive collections are often configured to revisit the same
original resource multiple times. This is incredibly useful for understanding
an unfolding news story or the evolution of an organization. Unfortunately,
over time, some of these original resources can go off-topic and no longer suit
the purpose for which the collection was originally created. They can go
off-topic due to web site redesigns, changes in domain ownership, financial
issues, hacking, technical problems, or because their content has moved on from
the original topic. Even though they are off-topic, the archiving system will
still capture them, thus it becomes imperative to anyone performing research on
these collections to identify these off-topic mementos. Hence, we present the
Off-Topic Memento Toolkit, which allows users to detect off-topic mementos
within web archive collections. The mementos identified by this toolkit can
then be separately removed from a collection or merely excluded from downstream
analysis. The following similarity measures are available: byte count, word
count, cosine similarity, Jaccard distance, S{\o}rensen-Dice distance, Simhash
using raw text content, Simhash using term frequency, and Latent Semantic
Indexing via the gensim library. We document the implementation of each of
these similarity measures. We possess a gold standard dataset generated by
manual analysis, which contains both off-topic and on-topic mementos. Using
this gold standard dataset, we establish a default threshold corresponding to
the best F1 score for each measure. We also provide an overview of potential
future directions that the toolkit may take.

computers. The quantum neural network is a variational quantum circuit built in
the continuous-variable (CV) architecture, which encodes quantum information in
continuous degrees of freedom such as the amplitudes of the electromagnetic
field. This circuit contains a layered structure of continuously parameterized
gates which is universal for CV quantum computation. Affine transformations and
nonlinear activation functions, two key elements in neural networks, are
enacted in the quantum network using Gaussian and non-Gaussian gates,
respectively. The non-Gaussian gates provide both the nonlinearity and the
universality of the model. Due to the structure of the CV model, the CV quantum
neural network can encode highly nonlinear transformations while remaining
completely unitary. We show how a classical network can be embedded into the
quantum formalism and propose quantum versions of various specialized model
such as convolutional, recurrent, and residual networks. Finally, we present
numerous modeling experiments built with the Strawberry Fields software
library. These experiments, including a classifier for fraud detection, a
network which generates Tetris images, and a hybrid classical-quantum
autoencoder, demonstrate the capability and adaptability of CV quantum neural
networks.

dark matter (DM) velocity distribution function (VDF) of the Milky Way (MW) on
DM direct detection rates. We go beyond local kinematic tracers and use
rotation curve data up to 200 kpc to construct a MW mass model and
self-consistently determine the local phase-space distribution of DM. This
approach mitigates any incomplete understanding of local dark matter-visible
matter degeneracies that can affect the determination of the VDF. Comparing
with the oft used Standard Halo Model (SHM), which assumes an isothermal VDF,
we look at how the tail of the empirically determined VDF alters our
interpretation of the present direct detection WIMP DM cross section exclusion
limits. While previous studies have suggested a very large difference (of more
than an order of magnitude) in the bounds at low DM masses, we show that
accounting for the detector response at low threshold energies, the difference
is still significant although less extreme. The change in the number of signal
events, when using the empirically determined DM VDF in contrast to the SHM
VDF, is most prominent for low DM masses for which the shape of the recoil
energy spectrum depends sensitively on the detector threshold energy as well as
detector response near the threshold. We demonstrate that these trends carry
over to the respective DM exclusion limits, modulo detailed understanding of
the experimental backgrounds. With the unprecedented precision of astrometric
data in the GAIA era, use of observationally determined DM phase-space will
become a critical and necessary ingredient for DM searches. We provide an
accurate fit to the current best observationally determined DM VDF (and
self-consistent local DM density) for use in analyzing current DM direct
detection data by the experimental community.

Archive-It, a subscription service started by the Internet Archive in 2005 for
the purpose of allowing organizations to create their own collections of
archived web pages, or mementos. Understanding these collections could be done
via their user-supplied metadata or via text analysis, but the metadata is
applied inconsistently between collections and some Archive-It collections
consist of hundreds of thousands of seeds, making it costly in terms of time to
download each memento. Our work proposes using structural metadata as an
additional way to understand these collections. We explore structural features
currently existing in these collections that can unveil curation and crawling
behaviors. We adapt the concept of the collection growth curve for
understanding Archive-It collection curation and crawling behavior. We also
introduce several seed features and come to an understanding of the diversity
of resources that make up a collection. Finally, we use the descriptions of
each collection to identify four semantic categories of Archive-It collections.
Using the identified structural features, we reviewed the results of runs with
20 classifiers and are able to predict the semantic category of a collection
using a Random Forest classifier with a weighted average F1 score of 0.720,
thus bridging the structural to the descriptive. Our method is useful because
it saves the researcher time and bandwidth. Identifying collections by their

in a flat fluid membrane composed of a binary fluid mixture lying in the
homogeneous phase near the demixing critical point. Assuming a sufficiently
small correlation length, we regard the domain dynamics as independent of the
critical fluctuation and use the Gaussian free-energy functional for the
mixture. Because of the near-criticality, the preferential attraction between
the domain component and one of the mixture components generates the
composition gradient outside the domain significantly and can affect the drag
coefficient. We first consider a domain having the same membrane viscosity as
the domain exterior. The drag coefficient is expanded with respect to a
dimensionless strength of the preferential attraction. It is numerically shown
that the magnitude of the expansion coefficient decreases much as the order of
the strength increases and that the first-order term of the series usually
gives a good approximation for practical material constants. The effect of the
preferential attraction is shown to be able to become significantly large in
practice. We second consider cases where the membrane viscosities of the domain
interior and exterior are different. The first-order term of the expansion
series decreases to approach zero as the domain viscosity increases to
infinity. This agrees with previous numerical results showing that the
hydrodynamics makes the effect of the preferential attraction negligibly small
for a rigid disk.

substantial part of flare energy is deposited in the chromosphere. However,
high-resolution spectro-polarimetric chromospheric observations of flares are
very rare. The most used observables are Ca II 8542 {\AA} and He I 10830 {\AA}.
Aims. We aim to study the chromosphere during a C3.6 class flare via
spectro-polarimetric observations of the He I D3 line. Methods. We present the
first SST/CRISP spectro-polarimetric observations of He I D3. We analyze the
data using the inversion code HAZEL, and estimate the LOS velocity and the
magnetic field vector. Results. Strong He I D3 emission at the flare
footpoints, as well as strong He I D3 absorption profiles tracing the flaring
loops are observed during the flare. The He I D3 traveling emission kernels at
the flare footpoints exhibit strong chromospheric condensations of up to $\sim$
60 km/s at their leading edge. Our observations suggest that such condensations
result in shocking the deep chromosphere, causing broad and modestly
blueshifted He I D3 profiles indicating subsequent upflows. A strong and rather
vertical magnetic field of up to $\sim$ 2500 G is measured in the flare
footpoints, confirming that the He I D3 line is likely formed in the deep
chromosphere at those locations. We provide chromospheric line-of-sight
velocity and magnetic field maps obtained via He I D3 inversions. We propose a
fan-spine configuration as the flare magnetic field topology. Conclusions. The
He I D3 line is an excellent diagnostic to study the chromosphere during
flares. The impact of strong condensations on the deep chromosphere has been
observed. Detailed maps of the flare dynamics and the magnetic field are
obtained.

minimize the human labor required for annotation, the proposed object detector
is first trained in simulation by using automatically annotated synthetic
images. We then show that the performance of the detector can be substantially
improved by using a small set of weakly annotated real images, where a human
provides only a list of objects present in each image without indicating the
location of the objects. To close the gap between real and synthetic images, we
adopt a domain adaptation approach through adversarial training. The detector
resulting from this training process can be used to localize objects by using
its per-object activation maps. In this work, we use the activation maps to
guide the search of 6D poses of objects. Our proposed approach is evaluated on
several publicly available datasets for pose estimation. We also evaluated our
model on classification and localization in unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings. The results clearly indicate that this approach could provide an
efficient way toward fully automating the training process of computer vision
models used in robotics.

or ultra-faint dwarf galaxies --- that are located at Galactocentric distances
of R$_{\rm GC}$ > 25 kpc (outer halo) and out to ~400 kpc. This includes 44
objects for which we have acquired deep, wide-field, $g-$ and $r-$band imaging
with the MegaCam mosaic cameras on the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and
the 6.5m Magellan-Clay telescope. These data are supplemented by archival
imaging, or published $gr$ photometry, for an additional 14 objects, most of
which were discovered recently in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We describe the
scientific motivation for our survey, including sample selection, observing
strategy, data reduction pipeline, calibration procedures, and the depth and
precision of the photometry. The typical 5$\sigma$ point-source limiting
magnitudes for our MegaCam imaging --- which collectively covers an area of ~52
deg$^{2}$ --- are $g_{\rm lim}$ ~25.6 and $r_{\rm lim}$ ~25.3 AB mag. These
limits are comparable to those from the coadded DES images and are roughly a
half-magnitude deeper than will be reached in a single visit with LSST. Our
photometric catalog thus provides the deepest and most uniform photometric
database of Milky Way satellites available for the foreseeable future. In other
papers in this series, we have used these data to explore the blue straggler
populations in these objects, their density distributions, star formation
histories, scaling relations and possible foreground structures.

volume expansion of the host-electrode, which is stored as elastic energy in
the system. This stored energy is hypothesized as an additional driving force
for grain boundaries and edge dislocations. Here, we apply the 2D
Cahn-Hilliard$-$phase-field-crystal (CH-PFC) model to investigate the coupled
interactions between highly mobile Li-ions and host-electrode lattice
structure, during an electrochemical cycle. We use a polycrystalline
FePO$_{4}$/ LiFePO$_{4}$ electrode particle as a model system. We compute grain
growth in the FePO$_{4}$ electrode in two parallel studies: In the first study,
we electrochemically cycle the electrode and calculate Li-diffusion assisted
grain growth. In the second study, we do not cycle the electrode and calculate
the curvature-driven grain growth. External loads, such as temperature and
stress, did not differ across studies. We find the mean grain-size increases by
$\sim11\%$ in the electrochemically cycled electrode particle. By contrast, in
the absence of electrochemical cycling, we find the mean grain-size increases
by $\sim2\%$ in the electrode particle. These CH-PFC computations suggest that
Li-intercalation accelerates grain-boundary migration in the host-electrode
particle. The CH-PFC simulations provide atomistic insights on
diffusion-induced grain-boundary migration, edge dislocation movement and
triple-junction drag-effect in the host-electrode microstructure.

of the algorithm and the circuit depth. The shortest possible circuit depth -
growing polynomially in the number of qubits representing the uncertainty -
leads to a convergence rate of $O(M^{-2/3})$. This is already faster than
classical Monte Carlo simulations which converge at a rate of $O(M^{-1/2})$. If
we allow the circuit depth to grow faster, but still polynomially, the
convergence rate quickly approaches the optimum of $O(M^{-1})$. Thus, for
slowly increasing circuit depths our algorithm provides a near quadratic
speed-up compared to Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate our algorithm using
two toy models. In the first model we use real hardware, such as the IBM Q
Experience, to measure the financial risk in a Treasury-bill (T-bill) faced by
a possible interest rate increase. In the second model, we simulate our

  free-energy landscape",,,,,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A central goal of protein-folding theory is to predict the stochastic
dynamics of transition paths --- the rare trajectories that transit between the
folded and unfolded ensembles --- using only thermodynamic information, such as
a low-dimensional equilibrium free-energy landscape. However, commonly used
one-dimensional landscapes typically fall short of this aim, because an
empirical coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficient has to be fit to
transition-path trajectory data in order to reproduce the transition-path
dynamics. We show that an alternative, first-principles free-energy landscape
predicts transition-path statistics that agree well with simulations and
single-molecule experiments without requiring dynamical data as an input. This
'topological configuration' model assumes that distinct, native-like
substructures assemble on a timescale that is slower than native-contact
formation but faster than the folding of the entire protein. Using only
equilibrium simulation data to determine the free energies of these
coarse-grained intermediate states, we predict a broad distribution of
transition-path transit times that agrees well with the transition-path
durations observed in simulations. We further show that both the distribution
of finite-time displacements on a one-dimensional order parameter and the
ensemble of transition-path trajectories generated by the model are consistent
with the simulated transition paths. These results indicate that a landscape
based on transient folding intermediates, which are often hidden by
one-dimensional projections, can form the basis of a predictive model of
protein-folding transition-path dynamics.

planets crucially influence losses to space and must be understood to constrain
the effects of losses on atmospheric evolution.
  Aims: We develop a 1D first-principles hydrodynamic atmosphere model that
calculates atmospheric thermal and chemical structures for arbitrary planetary
parameters, chemical compositions, and stellar inputs. We apply the model to
study the reaction of the Earth's upper atmosphere to large changes in the
CO$_2$ abundance and to changes in the input solar XUV field due to the Sun's
activity evolution from 3~Gyr in the past to 2.5~Gyr in the future.
  Methods: For the thermal atmosphere structure, we consider heating from the
absorption of stellar X-ray, UV, and IR radiation, heating from exothermic
chemical reactions, electron heating from collisions with non-thermal
photoelectrons, Joule heating, cooling from IR emission by several species,
thermal conduction, and energy exchanges between the neutral, ion, and electron
gases. For the chemical structure, we consider $\sim$500 chemical reactions,
including 56 photoreactions, eddy and molecular diffusion, and advection. In
addition, we calculate the atmospheric structure by solving the hydrodynamic
equations. To solve the equations in our model, we develop the Kompot code and
provide detailed descriptions of the numerical methods used in the appendices.
  Results: We verify our model by calculating the structures of the upper
atmospheres of the modern Earth and Venus. By varying the CO$_2$ abundances at
the lower boundary (65~km) of our Earth model, we show that the atmospheric
thermal structure is significantly altered. [Abstract Truncated]

its gain is severely bounded especially when started from a thermal sample.
More precisely, the maximum phase space density, can only be improved by a
factor M for M-level atoms. This bound comes from a transfer between the

Due to the nonlinearity of the space of persistence diagrams equipped with
their {\em diagram distances}, most of the recent attempts at using persistence
diagrams in machine learning have been done through kernel methods, i.e.,
embeddings of persistence diagrams into Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, in
which all computations can be performed easily. Since persistence diagrams
enjoy theoretical stability guarantees for the diagram distances, the {\em
metric properties} of the feature map, i.e., the relationship between the
Hilbert distance and the diagram distances, are of central interest for
understanding if the persistence diagram guarantees carry over to the
embedding. In this article, we study the possibility of embedding persistence
diagrams into separable Hilbert spaces, with bi-Lipschitz maps. In particular,
we show that for several stable embeddings into infinite-dimensional Hilbert
spaces defined in the literature, any lower bound must depend on the
cardinalities of the persistence diagrams, and that when the Hilbert space is
finite dimensional, finding a bi-Lipschitz embedding is impossible, even when
restricting the persistence diagrams to have bounded cardinalities.

  19th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC), 2018",,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are many settings in which a principal performs a task by delegating it
to an agent, who searches over possible solutions and proposes one to the
principal. This describes many aspects of the workflow within organizations, as
well as many of the activities undertaken by regulatory bodies, who often
obtain relevant information from the parties being regulated through a process
of delegation. A fundamental tension underlying delegation is the fact that the
agent's interests will typically differ -- potentially significantly -- from
the interests of the principal, and as a result the agent may propose solutions
based on their own incentives that are inefficient for the principal. A basic
problem, therefore, is to design mechanisms by which the principal can
constrain the set of proposals they are willing to accept from the agent, to
ensure a certain level of quality for the principal from the proposed solution.
  In this work, we investigate how much the principal loses -- quantitatively,
in terms of the objective they are trying to optimize -- when they delegate to
an agent. We develop a methodology for bounding this loss of efficiency, and
show that in a very general model of delegation, there is a family of
mechanisms achieving a universal bound on the ratio between the quality of the
solution obtained through delegation and the quality the principal could obtain
in an idealized benchmark where they searched for a solution themself.
Moreover, it is possible to achieve such bounds through mechanisms with a
natural threshold structure, which are thus structurally simpler than the
optimal mechanisms typically considered in the literature on delegation. At the
heart of our framework is an unexpected connection between delegation and the
analysis of prophet inequalities, which we leverage to provide bounds on the
behavior of our delegation mechanisms.

the strength of the SCM, and a zero-energy mode occurs together with metallic
DC conductivity. Further increase of the La substitution doesn't change the

the SCM spectral weight to the zero-energy mode, with a corresponding reduction
of the DC resistivity for all temperatures from 4 to 300 K. The presence of a

Modeling errors are due to the choice of the mathematical model whilst
discretization errors measure the impact of the choice of the numerical method
on the accuracy of the approximated solution to this specific mathematical
model. A major source of discretization errors is mesh generation from medical
images, that remains one of the major bottlenecks in the development of
reliable, accurate, automatic and efficient personalized, clinically-relevant
Finite Element (FE) models in biomechanics. The impact of mesh quality and
density on the accuracy of the FE solution can be quantified with \emph{a
posteriori} error estimates. Yet, to our knowledge, the relevance of such error
estimates for practical biomechanics problems has seldom been addressed, see
[25]. In this contribution, we propose an implementation of some a posteriori
error estimates to quantify the discretization errors and to optimize the mesh.
More precisely, we focus on error estimation for a user-defined quantity of
interest with the Dual Weighted Residual (DWR) technique. We test its
applicability and relevance in two situations, corresponding to computations
for a tongue and an artery, using a simplified setting, i.e., plane linearized
elasticity with contractility of the soft-tissue modeled as a pre-stress. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of such methodology to estimate the actual
solution errors and to reduce them economically through mesh refinement.

gaseous outbursts. However, the Rosetta Plasma Consortium instruments showed a
coronal mass ejection (CME) impact at the comet coincident with the emission
increases, suggesting that the CME impact may have been the cause of the
increased emission. The presence of the semi-forbidden O I 1356 $\AA$ emission
multiplet is indicative of a substantial increase in dissociative electron
impact emission from the coma, suggesting a change in the electron population
during the CME impact. The increase in dissociative electron impact could be a
result of the interaction between the CME and the coma of 67P or an outburst
coincident with the arrival of the CME. The observed dissociative electron
impact emission during this period is used to characterize the O2 content of
the coma at two peaks during the CME arrival. The mechanism that could cause
the relationship between the CME and UV emission brightness is not well
constrained, but we present several hypotheses to explain the correlation.

with limited resources or applications that require real-time responses. As a
case study, a state-of-the-art neural language model usually consists of one or
more recurrent layers sandwiched between an embedding layer used for
representing input tokens and a softmax layer for generating output tokens. For
problems with a very large vocabulary size, the embedding and the softmax
matrices can account for more than half of the model size. For instance, the
bigLSTM model achieves state-of- the-art performance on the One-Billion-Word
(OBW) dataset with around 800k vocabulary, and its word embedding and softmax
matrices use more than 6GBytes space, and are responsible for over 90% of the
model parameters. In this paper, we propose GroupReduce, a novel compression
method for neural language models, based on vocabulary-partition (block) based
low-rank matrix approximation and the inherent frequency distribution of tokens
(the power-law distribution of words). The experimental results show our method
can significantly outperform traditional compression methods such as low-rank
approximation and pruning. On the OBW dataset, our method achieved 6.6 times
compression rate for the embedding and softmax matrices, and when combined with
quantization, our method can achieve 26 times compression rate, which
translates to a factor of 12.8 times compression for the entire model with very
little degradation in perplexity.

extended about a QCD action only including the Yukawa interaction of a single
quark with a scalar field. We repeat the calculation of the two loop effective
action of the model for the scalar field. A correction of the evaluation
allowed choosing a strong coupling $\alpha $($\mu,\Lambda_{QCD})=0.2254$ GeV at
an intermediate scale $\mu=11.63$ GeV, in order to fix the minimum of the
potential at a scalar field determining $175$ GeV for the quark mass. A scalar
field mass $m=44$ GeV is following, which is of the order than the experimental
Higgs mass. The effects of considering a running with momenta coupling are
studied. For this, the finite part of the two loop potential contribution
determined by the strong coupling, was represented as a momentum integral.
Next, substituting in this integral the experimental values of the running
coupling, the potential curve became very similar to the one for constant
coupling. This happened after simply assuming that the low momentum dependence
of the coupling is ""saturated"" to a constant value being close to its lowest
experimental value.

orbit-coupling or a topologically non-trivial spin texture. The topological
Hall effect (THE) - caused by the latter - is commonly observed in magnetic
skyrmion crystals. Here, we show analogies of the THE to the conventional Hall
effect (HE), the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and the spin Hall effect (SHE).
In the limit of strong coupling between conduction electron spins and the local
magnetic texture the THE can be described by means of a fictitious, 'emergent'
magnetic field. In this sense the THE can be mapped onto the HE caused by an
external magnetic field. Due to complete alignment of electron spin and
magnetic texture, the transverse charge conductivity is linked to a transverse
spin conductivity. They are disconnected for weak coupling of electron spin and
magnetic texture; the THE is then related to the AHE. The topological
equivalent to the SHE can be found in antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals. We
substantiate our claims by calculations of the edge states for a finite sample.
These states reveal in which situation the topological analogue to a quantized
HE, quantized AHE, and quantized SHE can be found.

assay is commonly used, it is important that the two assays give similar
results. Calibration of the DIA assay to the MIC assay is typically done using
the error-rate bounded method, which selects DIA breakpoints that minimize the
observed discrepancies between the two assays. In 2000, Craig proposed a
model-based approach that specifically models the measurement error and
rounding processes of each assay, the underlying pathogen distribution, and the
true monotonic relationship between the two assays. The two assays are then
calibrated by focusing on matching the probabilities of correct classification
(susceptible, indeterminant, and resistant). This approach results in greater
precision and accuracy for estimating DIA breakpoints. In this paper, we expand
the flexibility of the model-based method by introducing a Bayesian
four-parameter logistic model (extending Craig's original three-parameter

(sports, cooking), animal behavior (a bee's waggle dance), natural phenomena
(leaves in the wind) and in urban environments (flashing lights). Estimating
visual repetition from realistic video is challenging as periodic motion is
rarely perfectly static and stationary. To better deal with realistic video, we
elevate the static and stationary assumptions often made by existing work. Our
spatiotemporal filtering approach, established on the theory of periodic
motion, effectively handles a wide variety of appearances and requires no
learning. Starting from motion in 3D we derive three periodic motion types by
decomposition of the motion field into its fundamental components. In addition,
three temporal motion continuities emerge from the field's temporal dynamics.
For the 2D perception of 3D motion we consider the viewpoint relative to the
motion; what follows are 18 cases of recurrent motion perception. To estimate
repetition under all circumstances, our theory implies constructing a mixture
of differential motion maps: gradient, divergence and curl. We temporally
convolve the motion maps with wavelet filters to estimate repetitive dynamics.
Our method is able to spatially segment repetitive motion directly from the
temporal filter responses densely computed over the motion maps. For
experimental verification of our claims, we use our novel dataset for
repetition estimation, better-reflecting reality with non-static and
non-stationary repetitive motion. On the task of repetition counting, we obtain
favorable results compared to a deep learning alternative.

popular. A nice property of tree-based models is their natural
interpretability. In this work, we present Deep Neural Decision Trees (DNDT) --
tree models realised by neural networks. A DNDT is intrinsically interpretable,
as it is a tree. Yet as it is also a neural network (NN), it can be easily
implemented in NN toolkits, and trained with gradient descent rather than
greedy splitting. We evaluate DNDT on several tabular datasets, verify its
efficacy, and investigate similarities and differences between DNDT and vanilla
decision trees. Interestingly, DNDT self-prunes at both split and
feature-level.

that particle size is mainly controlled by the reaction rate. Thus, the changes
observed on the particle sizes as reaction conditions, such as concentrations,
temperature, type of surfactant used, etc., are varied should not be correlated
directly to the modification of those conditions but indirectly to the changes
they produce on the reaction rates. By means of time resolved UV-vis
spectroscopy, we measured the reaction rates in the production of Pd
nanoparticles inside microemulsions at different reactant concentrations,
keeping all the other parameters constant. The measured reaction rates were
then correlated with the particle sizes measured by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). We found that nanoparticle size increases linearly as the
reaction rates increases, independently of the actual reactant concentrations.
We proposed that the kinetics is controlled mainly by the diffusion of the
reducing agent through the surfactant monolayer covering the microemulsion
membrane. With this model, we predicted that particle size should depend
indirectly, via the reaction kinetics, on the micelle radius (v0 ~ r^-3), the
water volume (v0~vw^3) and the total microemulsion volume (v0~vT^-3), and
temperature (Arrhenius). Some of these predictions were explored in this
article.

is that, the beamformers may experience significant changes between adjacent
subchannels, therefore destroy the orthogonality among FBMC/OQAM real-valued
symbols, even under channels with moderate frequency selectivity. In this
paper, we address this problem from two aspects: i) an SVD-FS-FBMC architecture
is adopted to support beamforming with finer granularity in frequency domain,
based on the frequency spreading FBMC (FS-FBMC) structure, i.e., beamforming on
FS-FBMC tones rather than on subchannels; ii) criterion and methods are
proposed to smooth the beamformers from tone to tone. The proposed finer
beamforming and smoothing greatly improve the smoothness of beamformers,
therefore effectively suppress the leaked ICI/ISI. Simulations are conducted
under the scenario of IEEE 802.11n wireless LAN. Results show that the proposed

fundamental problem in computational mathematics, with applications to
polynomial optimization, control, machine learning, game theory, and
combinatorics, among others. A number of breakthrough papers in the early 2000s
showed that this problem, long thought to be out of reach, could be tackled by
using sum of squares programming. This technique however has proved to be
expensive for large-scale problems, as it involves solving large semidefinite
programs (SDPs).
  In the first part of this thesis, we present two methods for approximately
solving large-scale sum of squares programs that dispense altogether with
semidefinite programming and only involve solving a sequence of linear or
second order cone programs generated in an adaptive fashion. We then focus on
the problem of finding tight lower bounds on polynomial optimization problems
(POPs), a fundamental task in this area that is most commonly handled through
the use of SDP-based sum of squares hierarchies (e.g., due to Lasserre and
Parrilo). In contrast to previous approaches, we provide the first theoretical
framework for constructing converging hierarchies of lower bounds on POPs whose
computation simply requires the ability to multiply certain fixed polynomials
together and to check nonnegativity of the coefficients of their product.
  In the second part of this thesis, we focus on the theory and applications of
the problem of optimizing over convex polynomials, a subcase of the problem of
optimizing over nonnegative polynomials. (See manuscript for the rest of the

principled approach to statistical modeling combining Occam's razor with
Information Theory for the selection of models providing the most concise
descriptions. In this work, we introduce the Boltzmannian MDL (BMDL), a
formalization of the principle of MDL with a parametric complexity conveniently
formulated as the free-energy of an artificial thermodynamic system. In this
way, we leverage on the rich theoretical and technical background of
statistical mechanics, to show the crucial importance that phase transitions
and other thermodynamic concepts have on the problem of statistical modeling
from an information theoretic point of view. For example, we provide
information theoretic justifications of why a high-temperature series expansion
can be used to compute systematic approximations of the BMDL when the formalism
is used to model data, and why statistically significant model selections can
be identified with ordered phases when the BMDL is used to model models. To
test the introduced formalism, we compute approximations of BMDL for the
problem of community detection in complex networks, where we obtain a
principled MDL derivation of the Girvan-Newman (GN) modularity and the
Zhang-Moore (ZM) community detection method. Here, by means of analytical
estimations and numerical experiments on synthetic and empirical networks, we
find that BMDL-based correction terms of the GN modularity improve the quality
of the detected communities and we also find an information theoretic
justification of why the ZM criterion for estimation of the number of network
communities is better than alternative approaches such as the bare minimization
of a free energy.

first extracts a shared feature map from the integer-position sample to infer
various sub-pixel position samples. Then a group variational transformation
technique is used to transform a group of copied shared feature maps to samples
at different sub-pixel positions. Experimental results have identified the
interpolation efficiency of our GVTCNN. Compared with the interpolation method

crowd-source programs for a variety of activities that happen in people's

into an orientable closed surface. A dessin is regular if its group of
orientation- and colour-preserving automorphisms acts regularly on the edges.
In this paper we study regular dessins whose underlying graph is a complete
bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$, called $(m,n)$-complete regular dessins. The purpose
is to establish a rather surprising correspondence between $(m,n)$-complete
regular dessins and pairs of skew-morphisms of cyclic groups. A skew-morphism
of a finite group $A$ is a bijection $\varphi\colon A\to A$ that satisfies the
identity $\varphi(xy)=\varphi(x)\varphi^{\pi(x)}(y)$ for some function
$\pi\colon A\to\mathbb{Z}$ and fixes the neutral element of~$A$. We show that
every $(m,n)$-complete regular dessin $\mathcal{D}$ determines a pair of
reciprocal skew-morphisms of the cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and
$\mathbb{Z}_m$.
  Conversely, $\mathcal{D}$ can be reconstructed from such a reciprocal pair.
  As a consequence, we prove that complete regular dessins, exact bicyclic
groups with a distinguished pair of generators, and pairs of reciprocal
skew-morphisms of cyclic groups are all in one-to-one correspondence. Finally,
we apply the main result to determining all pairs of integers $m$ and $n$ for
which there exists, up to interchange of colours, exactly one $(m,n)$-complete
regular dessin. We show that the latter occurs precisely when every group
expressible as a product of cyclic groups of order $m$ and $n$ is abelian,
which eventually comes down to the condition
$\gcd(m,\phi(n))=\gcd(\phi(m),n)=1$, where $\phi$ is Euler's totient function.

structure of smooth error down to the coarse levels, we approximate the level
sets of the smooth error by first forming vertex-disjoint path cover with paths
following the level sets. The aggregations are then formed by matching along
the paths in the path cover. In such manner, we are able to build a multilevel

every graph with maximum average degree less than $\frac{2d+2}{d+2} k$ is

Sereni [J. Graph Theory, 2006]. For clustered choosability of graphs with

implies that every graph with maximum average degree $m$ is
$\lfloor{\frac{3}{4}m+1}\rfloor$-choosable with clustering 2. This extends a
result of Kopreski and Yu [Discrete Math., 2017] to the setting of
choosability. We then prove two results about clustered choosability that
explore the trade-off between the number of colours and the clustering. In
particular, we prove that every graph with maximum average degree $m$ is
$\lfloor{\frac{7}{10}m+1}\rfloor$-choosable with clustering $9$, and is
$\lfloor{\frac{2}{3}m+1}\rfloor$-choosable with clustering $O(m)$. As an
example, the later result implies that every biplanar graph is 8-choosable with
bounded clustering. This is the best known result for the clustered version of

hybrid contract checking. In this article, we study techniques to reasoning
about a polymorphic manifest contract calculus, including a few program
transformations related to static contract verification. We first define a
polymorphic manifest contract calculus $\mathrm{F}_{H}$, which is much simpler
than a previously studied one with delayed substitution, and a logical relation
for it and prove that the logical relation is sound with respect to contextual
equivalence. Next, we show that the upcast elimination property, which has been
studied as correctness of subtyping-based static cast verification, holds for
$\mathrm{F}_{H}$. More specifically, we give a subtyping relation (which is not
part of the calculus) for $\mathrm{F}_{H}$ types and prove that a term obtained
by eliminating upcasts---casts from one type to a supertype of it---is
logically related and so contextually equivalent to the original one. We also
justify two other program transformations for casts: selfification and static
cast decomposition, which help upcast elimination. A challenge is that, due to
the subsumption-free approach to manifest contracts, these program
transformations do not always preserve well-typedness of terms. To address it,
the logical relation and contextual equivalence in this work are defined as
semityped relations: only one side of the relations is required to be well
typed and the other side may be ill typed.

stars. In order to explore the overshooting mixing beyond the convective core,
we incorporated the $k$-$\omega$ proposed by Li (2012, 2017) into MESA, and
investigated the overshooting mixing in evolution of sdB models. We found that
the development of the convective core can be divided into three stages. When
the radiative temperature gradient $\nabla_{\rm rad}$ monotonically decreases
from the stellar center, the overshooting mixing presents a behaviour of
exponential decay similar with Herwig (2000), and the overshooting distance is
to make $\nabla_{\rm rad} \simeq \nabla_{\rm ad}$ at the boundary of the
convective core, in agreement with the prediction of the self-driving mechanism
Castellani, Giannone \& Renzini (1971a). When the radiative temperature
gradient $\nabla_{\rm rad}$ shows a minimum value in the convective core, the
convective core may be divided into two convection zones if the minimum value
of $\nabla_{\rm rad}$ is smaller than the adiabatic temperature gradient
$\nabla_{\rm ad}$. For the single-zone case, the overshooting mixing still
shows an exponential decay behaviour, but the overshooting distance is much
smaller than in the initial stage. For the double-zone case, the overshooting
mixing is similar to that of the single-case beyond the convective core, while
it almost stops on both sides of the above convective shell. Our overshooting
mixing scheme is similar to the maximal overshoot scheme of Constantino et al.
(2015). In the final stage, continuous injection of fresh helium into the
convective core by the overshooting mixing happens, which is similar to the
""core breathing pulses"" (Sweigart \& Demarque 1973; Castellani et al. 1985).

practical consequences to iterative methods for solving the inverse problem

within a scene. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted local features and
probabilistic graphical models to incorporate local and global cues. Recently,
methods based on fully convolutional neural networks have achieved new records
on scene parsing. An important strategy common to these methods is the
aggregation of hierarchical features yielded by a deep convolutional neural
network. However, typical algorithms usually aggregate hierarchical
convolutional features via concatenation or linear combination, which cannot
sufficiently exploit the diversities of contextual information in multi-scale
features and the spatial inhomogeneity of a scene. In this paper, we propose a
mixture-of-experts scene parsing network (MoE-SPNet) that incorporates a
convolutional mixture-of-experts layer to assess the importance of features
from different levels and at different spatial locations. In addition, we
propose a variant of mixture-of-experts called the adaptive hierarchical
feature aggregation (AHFA) mechanism which can be incorporated into existing
scene parsing networks that use skip-connections to fuse features layer-wisely.
In the proposed networks, different levels of features at each spatial location
are adaptively re-weighted according to the local structure and surrounding
contextual information before aggregation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods on two scene parsing datasets including PASCAL VOC 2012

capacitor, in kinetic-powered wearable IoTs as a sensor to detect human
activities. Since different activities accumulate energies in the capacitor at
different rates, these activities can be detected directly by observing the
charging rate of the capacitor. The key advantage of the proposed capacitor
based activity sensing mechanism, called CapSense, is that it obviates the need
for sampling the motion signal during the activity detection period thus
significantly saving power consumption of the wearable device. A challenge we
face is that capacitors are inherently non-linear energy accumulators, which,
even for the same activity, leads to significant variations in charging rates
at different times depending on the current charge level of the capacitor. We
solve this problem by jointly configuring the parameters of the capacitor and
the associated energy harvesting circuits, which allows us to operate on
charging cycles that are approximately linear. We design and implement a
kinetic-powered shoe sole and conduct experiments with 10 subjects. Our results
show that CapSense can classify five different daily activities with 95%
accuracy while consuming 73% less system power compared to conventional motion

lymph nodes through Whole-slide Images (WSIs). Recent advances in deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown significant successes in
medical image analysis and particularly in computational histopathology.
Because of the outrageous large size of WSIs, most of the methods divide one
slide into lots of small image patches and perform classification on each patch
independently. However, neighboring patches often share spatial correlations,
and ignoring these spatial correlations may result in inconsistent predictions.
In this paper, we propose a neural conditional random field (NCRF) deep
learning framework to detect cancer metastasis in WSIs. NCRF considers the
spatial correlations between neighboring patches through a fully connected CRF
which is directly incorporated on top of a CNN feature extractor. The whole
deep network can be trained end-to-end with standard back-propagation algorithm
with minor computational overhead from the CRF component. The CNN feature
extractor can also benefit from considering spatial correlations via the CRF
component. Compared to the baseline method without considering spatial
correlations, we show that the proposed NCRF framework obtains probability maps
of patch predictions with better visual quality. We also demonstrate that our
method outperforms the baseline in cancer metastasis detection on the
Camelyon16 dataset and achieves an average FROC score of 0.8096 on the test
set. NCRF is open sourced at https://github.com/baidu-research/NCRF.

(COLD) features of handwriting components. The proposed method, at first,
explores tangent angle for the contour pixels in each row and the mean of
intensity values of each row in an image for segmenting text lines. For
segmented text lines, we use tangent angle and direction of base lines to
remove rule lines in the image. We use polygonal approximation for finding
dominant points for contours of edge components. Then the proposed method
connects the nearest dominant points of every dominant point, which results in
line segments of dominant point pairs. For each line segment, the proposed
method estimates angle and length, which gives a point in polar domain. For all
the line segments, the proposed method generates dense points in polar domain,
which results in COLD distribution. As character component shapes change,
according to nationals, the shape of the distribution changes. This observation
is extracted based on distance from pixels of distribution to Principal Axis of
the distribution. Then the features are subjected to an SVM classifier for
identifying nationals. Experiments are conducted on a complex dataset, which
show the proposed method is effective and outperforms the existing method

the cost function is the sum of the individual objectives of the agents and the
constraint set is the intersection of local constraints. Most existing methods
employing subgradient and consensus steps for solving this problem require the
weight matrix associated with the network to be column stochastic or even
doubly stochastic, conditions that can be hard to arrange in directed networks.
Moreover, known convergence analyses for distributed subgradient methods vary
depending on whether the problem is unconstrained or constrained, and whether
the local constraint sets are identical or nonidentical and compact. The main
goals of this paper are: (i) removing the common column stochasticity
requirement; (ii) relaxing the compactness assumption, and (iii) providing a
unified convergence analysis. Specifically, assuming the communication graph to
be fixed and strongly connected and the weight matrix to (only) be row
stochastic, a distributed projected subgradient algorithm and its variation are
presented to solve the problem for cost functions that are convex and Lipschitz
continuous. Based on a regularity assumption on the local constraint sets, a
unified convergence analysis is given that can be applied to both unconstrained
and constrained problems and without assuming compactness of the constraint
sets or an interior point in their intersection. Further, we also establish an
upper bound on the absolute objective error evaluated at each agent's available
local estimate under a nonincreasing step size sequence. This bound allows us
to analyze the convergence rate of both algorithms.

between the BALQ and non-BALQ populations given the observed spectral
properties of a quasar, we employ two approaches: one based on statistical
methods and the other supervised machine learning classification, applied to
quasar samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The features explored include
continuum and emission line properties, in particular the absolute magnitude,
redshift, spectral index, line width, asymmetry, strength, and relative
velocity offsets of high-ionisation CIV $\lambda 1549$ and low-ionisation MgII
$\lambda 2798$ lines.
  We consider a complete population of quasars, and assume that the statistical
distributions of properties represent all angles where the quasar is viewed
without obscuration. The distributions of the BALQ and non-BALQ sample
properties show few significant differences. None of the observed continuum and
emission line features are capable of differentiating between the two samples.
Most published narrow disk-wind models are inconsistent with these

in the Meissner state to create low-loss mechanical oscillators with long
coherence times. In these proposals the derivation of the force on the
superconducting sphere and the coupling to the sphere typically relies on a
vanishing penetration depth $\lambda$ as well as a specific symmetry (i.e.
restricting the position of the sphere to one axis) or heuristic methods (e.g.
assigning an equivalent point magnetic dipole moment to the sphere). In this
paper we analytically solve the Maxwell-London equations with appropriate
boundary conditions for a superconducting sphere in a quadrupole field. The
analytic solutions provide the full field distribution for arbitrary $\lambda$
and for an arbitrary sphere position as well as the distribution of shielding
currents within the sphere. We furthermore calculate the force acting on the
sphere and the maximum field over the volume of the sphere. We show that for a
certain range of $\lambda$ the maximum field experienced by the superconducting
sphere is actually lower than it is for a non-magnetic sphere.

mel-filterbanks that use a convolutional architecture. The first one is
inspired by gammatone filterbanks (Hoshen et al., 2015; Sainath et al, 2015),

propose two modifications to these architectures and systematically compare
them to mel-filterbanks, on the Wall Street Journal dataset. The first
modification is the addition of an instance normalization layer, which greatly
improves on the gammatone-based trainable filterbanks and speeds up the
training of the scattering-based filterbanks. The second one relates to the
low-pass filter used in these approaches. These modifications consistently
improve performances for both approaches, and remove the need for a careful
initialization in scattering-based trainable filterbanks. In particular, we
show a consistent improvement in word error rate of the trainable filterbanks
relatively to comparable mel-filterbanks. It is the first time end-to-end

produced due to dark matter annihilation. We consider the effect of adiabatic
contraction of dark matter density due to the supermassive black hole at the
Milky Way center and perform a detailed calculation to constrain the possible
annihilation channel and dark matter mass range. We find that only three
annihilation channels ($\mu^+\mu^-$, $4e$ and $4 \mu$) can provide the required
positron production rate and satisfy the stringent constraint of gamma-ray
observations. In particular, the constrained mass range for the $\mu^+\mu^-$
channel is $m \approx 80-100$ GeV, which is close to the mass range obtained
for the dark matter interpretation of the GeV gamma-ray and positron excess. In
other words, the proposed scenario can simultaneously provide the required
positron production rate to explain the 511 keV emission, the positron excess
and the GeV gamma-ray excess in our Milky Way, and it is compatible with the
density spike due to adiabatic growth model of the supermassive black hole.

theoretical studies to determine large-amplitude (fully) nonlinear solutions in
a variety of multi-species plasmas. Although these solutions are repeatedly
considered as solitary waves (and even solitons), their temporal stability has
never been proven. In this paper, a numerical study of the Vlasov-Poisson
system is made to follow their temporal evolution in the presence of numerical
noise and thereby test their long-time propagation stability. Considering the
ion-acoustic regime, both constituents of the plasma, i.e. electrons and ions
are treated following their distribution functions in these set of fully
kinetic simulations. The findings reveal that the stability of Sagdeev solution
depends on a combination of two parameters, i.e. velocity and trapping
parameter. It is shown that there exists a critical value of trapping parameter
for both fast and slow solutions which separates the stable from unstable
solutions. In case of stable solutions, it is shown that these nonlinear
structures can propagate for long periods, which confirms their status as
solitary waves. Stable solutions are reported for both Maxwellian and Kappa
distribution functions. For unstable solutions, it is demonstrated that the
instability causes the Sagdeev solution to decay by emitting ion-acoustic
wave-packets on its propagation trail. The instability is shown to take place
in a large range of velocity and even for Sagdeev solutions with velocity much
higher than ion sound speed. Besides, in order to validate our simulation code
two precautionary measures are taken. Firstly, the well-known effect of the ion
dynamics on a stationary electron hole solution is presented as a benchmarking
test of the approach. Secondly, In order to verify the numerical accuracy of
the simulations, the conservation of energy and entropy are presented.

Defender can control a mobile resource, the targets are alarmed by an alarm

Defender and perform different attacks exploiting multiple resources. This
scenario can be modeled as a zero-sum extensive-form game in which each player
can play multiple times. The game tree is exponentially large both in the size
of the graph and in the number of attacking resources. We show that when the
number of the Attacker's resources is free, the problem of computing the
equilibrium path is NP-hard, while when the number of resources is fixed, the
equilibrium path can be computed in poly-time. We provide a dynamic-programming
algorithm that, given the number of the Attacker's resources, computes the
equilibrium path requiring poly-time in the size of the graph and exponential
time in the number of the resources. Furthermore, since in real-world scenarios
it is implausible that the Defender knows the number of attacking resources, we
study the robustness of the Defender's strategy when she makes a wrong guess
about that number. We show that even the error of just a single resource can
lead to an arbitrary inefficiency, when the inefficiency is defined as the
ratio of the Defender's utilities obtained with a wrong guess and a correct
guess. However, a more suitable definition of inefficiency is given by the
difference of the Defender's utilities: this way, we observe that the higher
the error in the estimation, the higher the loss for the Defender. Then, we
investigate the performance of online algorithms when no information about the
Attacker's resources is available. Finally, we resort to randomized online
algorithms showing that we can obtain a competitive factor that is twice better

further investigations. We study this model by computing its equilibrium
properties through MC simulations, based on the determination of the density of

disordered phase deviates from its initial progression towards the topological
transition, crossing over to a new fixed point, condensing into a nematic phase
with exponential correlations of its director fluctuations. The thermally
induced topological kinetic processes continue, however limited to the length
scales set by the nematic director fluctuations, and lead to a second
topological transition at a lower temperature. We argue that in the (\textit{d}

early Universe to the interior of neutron stars. While dynamo action in a
turbulent plasma is often invoked, in the last years a novel mechanism of
quantum origin has gained increasingly more attention, namely the Chiral
Magnetic Effect (CME). This has been recognized in semi-metals and it is most
likely at work in the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collision
experiments, where the highest magnetic fields in nature, up to B~10^18 G, are
produced. This effect is expected to survive even at large hydrodynamical/MHD
scales and it is based on the chiral anomaly due to an imbalance between left-
and right-handed relativistic fermions in the constituent plasma. Such
imbalance leads to an electric current parallel to an external magnetic field,
which is precisely the same mechanism of an alpha-dynamo action in classical
MHD. Here we extend the close parallelism between the chiral and the dynamo
effects to relativistic plasmas and we propose a unified, fully covariant
formulation of the generalized Ohm's law. Moreover, we derive for the first
time the 3+1 general relativistic MHD equations for a chiral plasma both in
flat and curved spacetimes, in view of numerical investigation of the CME in
compact objects, especially magnetars, or of the interplay among the non-ideal
magnetic effects of dynamo, the CME and reconnection.

technology threatening ones are flares with associated coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) and solar energetic particles (SEPs). Flares with associated CMEs and
SEPs are produced by magnetohydrodynamical processes in magnetically active
regions (ARs) on the Sun. However, these ARs do not only produce flares with
associated CMEs and SEPs, they also lead to flares and CMEs, which are not
associated with any other event. In an attempt to distinguish flares with
associated CMEs and SEPs from flares and CMEs, which are unassociated with any
other event, we investigate the performances of two machine learning
algorithms. To achieve this objective, we employ support vector machines (SVMs)
and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) using data from the Space Weather Database of
Notification, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) of NASA Space Weather Center, {\it
the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite} ({\it GOES}), and the
Space-Weather Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patches (SHARPs).
We show that True Skill Statistics (TSS) and Heidke Skill Scores (HSS)
calculated for SVMs are slightly better than those from the MLPs. We also show
that the forecasting time frame of 96 hours provides the best results in
predicting if a flare will be associated with CMEs and SEPs (TSS=0.92$\pm$0.09
and HSS=0.92$\pm$0.08). Additionally, we obtain the maximum TSS and HSS values
of 0.91$\pm$0.06 for predicting that a flare will not be associated with CMEs
and SEPs for the 36 hour forecast window, while the 108 hour forecast window
give the maximum TSS and HSS values for predicting CMEs will not be
accompanying any events (TSS=HSS=0.98$\pm$0.02).

citations per publication respectively. The study focuses on scientific outputs
(in the form of papers published in peer-reviewed journals) and their impact
(measured by the citations they have received) to bring into a light a

wherein optimization permeates all aspects of production, from concept
generation to sales. To fully pursue this paradigm, flexibility in the
production means as well as in their timely organization is of paramount
importance. AI is planning a major role in this transition, but the scenarios
encountered in practice might be challenging for current tools. Task planning
is one example where AI enables more efficient and flexible operation through
an online automated adaptation and rescheduling of the activities to cope with
new operational constraints and demands.
  In this paper we present SMarTplan, a task planner specifically conceived to
deal with real-world scenarios in the emerging smart factory paradigm.
Including both special-purpose and general-purpose algorithms, SMarTplan is
based on current automated reasoning technology and it is designed to tackle
complex application domains. In particular, we show its effectiveness on a
logistic scenario, by comparing its specialized version with the general
purpose one, and extending the comparison to other state-of-the-art task
planners.

condensation of CO$_{2}$ ice during winter, up to a meter thick at the pole and
thousands of kilometers in extension. Water and dust may be trapped during the
condensation and freed during the sublimation. In addition, ice may be
translucent or granular depending on the deposition process (snow vs direct
condensation), annealing efficiency, and dust sinking process. The
determination of ice translucency is of particular interest to confirm or
reject the cold jet model (also known as Kieffer model).
  This work is focused on the dune field of Richardson Crater in which strong
interactions between the water, dust and CO$_{2}$ cycles are observed. We
analyzed CRISM hyperspectral images in the near IR using radiative transfer
model inversion. We demonstrate that among the states of CO$_{2}$ ice, the
translucent state is observed most frequently. The monitoring of surface
characteristics shows a decrease in the thickness of the ice during the spring
consistently with climate models simulations. We estimate a very low dust
content of a few ppmv into the CO$_{2}$ ice, consistent with the formation
scenario of cold jets. The water impurities is around 0.1\%v, almost stable
during the spring, suggesting a water escape from the surface of subliming
CO$_{2}$ ice layer. The water ice grain size varies in a range 1 to 50 microns.
From these results, we propose the following new mechanism of small water ice
grain suspension: as a cold jet occurs, water ice grains of various sizes are
lifted from the surface. These jets happen during daytime, when the general
upward gas flux from the subliming CO$_{2}$ ice layer is strong enough to carry
the smaller grains, while the bigger fall back on the CO$_{2}$ ice layer. The
smaller water grains are carried away and integrated to the general atmospheric
circulation.

method for scalable Bayesian inference. These methods are based on sampling a
discrete-time approximation to a continuous time process, such as the Langevin
diffusion. When applied to distributions defined on a constrained space the
time-discretization error can dominate when we are near the boundary of the
space. We demonstrate that because of this, current SGMCMC methods for the
simplex struggle with sparse simplex spaces; when many of the components are
close to zero. Unfortunately, many popular large-scale Bayesian models, such as
network or topic models, require inference on sparse simplex spaces. To avoid
the biases caused by this discretization error, we propose the stochastic
Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process (SCIR), which removes all discretization error and
we prove that samples from the SCIR process are asymptotically unbiased. We
discuss how this idea can be extended to target other constrained spaces. Use
of the SCIR process within a SGMCMC algorithm is shown to give substantially
better performance for a topic model and a Dirichlet process mixture model than
existing SGMCMC approaches.

performance of machine learning models, allowing model selection and parameter
tuning. However, the very process of CV requires random partitioning of the
data and so our performance estimates are in fact stochastic, with variability
that can be substantial for natural language processing tasks. We demonstrate
that these unstable estimates cannot be relied upon for effective parameter
tuning. The resulting tuned parameters are highly sensitive to how our data is
partitioned, meaning that we often select sub-optimal parameter choices and
have serious reproducibility issues.
  Instead, we propose to use the less variable J-K-fold CV, in which J
independent K-fold cross validations are used to assess performance. Our main
contributions are extending J-K-fold CV from performance estimation to
parameter tuning and investigating how to choose J and K. We argue that
variability is more important than bias for effective tuning and so advocate
lower choices of K than are typically seen in the NLP literature, instead use
the saved computation to increase J. To demonstrate the generality of our
recommendations we investigate a wide range of case-studies: sentiment
classification (both general and target-specific), part-of-speech tagging and
document classification.

the case when the type of coexistence decides on the appearance of

available to study the structure and organization principles of fibrous tissue
samples, but they usually provide only 2D information. To access the third
(out-of-plane) dimension, more advanced techniques are employed. An example is
3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI), which measures the birefringence of
histological brain sections to derive the spatial nerve fiber orientations.
Here, we show how light scattering in transmission microscopy measurements can
be leveraged to gain 3D structural information about fibrous tissue samples
like brain tissue. For this purpose, we developed a simulation framework using
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and high performance
computing, which can easily be adapted to other microscopy techniques and
tissue types with comparable fibrous structures (e.g., muscle fibers, collagen,
or artificial fibers). As conventional bright-field transmission microscopy
provides usually only 2D information about tissue structures, a
three-dimensional reconstruction of fibers across several sections is
difficult. By combining our simulations with experimental studies, we show that
the polarization-independent transmitted light intensity (transmittance)
contains 3D information: We demonstrate in several experimental studies on
brain sections from different species (rodent, monkey, human) that the
transmittance decreases significantly (by more than 50%) with the increasing
out-of-plane angle of the nerve fibers. Our FDTD simulations show that this
decrease is mainly caused by polarization-independent light scattering in
combination with the finite numerical aperture of the imaging system. This
allows to use standard transmission microscopy techniques to obtain 3D
information about the fiber inclination and to detect steep fibers, without
need for additional measurements.

the system of such discrete volume-localized levels depends on the charge and
increases with charge increasing. For C60+1, the energy width is 0.32 a.u. and
increases up to 1.9 a.u. for fullerene C60+10. Thus, the electrons captured on
these discrete levels of fullerene form a sort of a short-lived ""nano-atom"" or
""nano-ion"", in which the electrons are localized inside a positively charged

those electron levels appear exclusively after the ionization of neutral

existence of those levels is argued, and their basic parameters (the energy
levels, the wave eigenfunctions) are approximately calculated. The wave
functions of VLELs are basically localized inside fullerene ion sphere (with a
maximum amplitude in the centre) in contrast to ordinary surface-localized
electron levels (SLELs) having a wave functions in the vicinity of fullerene
sphere formed by the cluster composed of carbon ions. Contrary to VLELs, the
wave functions of SLELs are present both in charged and neutral fullerene. The
analysis of electron beam interaction with the medium consistent of fullerenes
ions is conducted as the application of the methods developed. The analytical
dependencies of free electron recombination cross-sections for the capture to

calculated dipole moments depend on fullerene ionization extent, initial and
final electron states, and are varied from about 0.2 to 5 in atomic system of
units. Finally, the principal possibility of coherent radiation generation on

such corrections to all orders into a renormalized jet quenching parameter. The

to produce BZ liquid marbles (LMs). The BZ LMs have solid--liquid interfaces in
contrast to the previously reported BZ encapsulation systems used to study
pattern formations and wave transfers, such as BZ emulsions and BZ vesicles.
All these systems are important to study as they can be seen as analogues for
information transfer in excitable systems in nature. Due to the powder coating
of the LMs, LMs do not wet the underlying substrate, making the LMs mobile,
enabling them to be easily arranged in arrays. The preparation of complex LMs,
containing an acidic oscillating solution, proves the resilience of LMs and
their application in transporting a wide range of chemical cargoes and in
playing a mediating role in chemical reactions. PTFE-coated LMs were harder to
prepare and not as robust as PE-coated LMs, therefore oscillation studies of BZ
LMs positioned in arrays only focused on PE-coated LMs. Sporadic transfer of
excitation waves was observed between LMs placed in close proximity to each
other in ordered and disordered arrays, suggesting the transfer of liquid
species possibly arises from contact between imperfectly coated areas at the
LM--LM interface or capillary action, where solution is actively transported to
the marble surface through the coating. Propagation pathways of the excitation
waves in both the disordered and ordered arrays of BZ LMs are reported. These
results lay the foundations for future studies on information transmission and
processing arrays of BZ LMs, in addition to observing BZ wave propagation in a
LM and the effect of other physical stimuli such as heat, light and chemical
environments on the dynamics of excitation in arrays of BZ Lms.

time of the photon count exhibits Gaussian shape at small times and exponential
tail at large times. The characteristic exponential time is larger for photons
with smaller energy and increases with external magnetic field while variations
in the Gaussian part of the distribution are less pronounced. Increasing photon
flux drives the nanowire from quantum detection mode to the bolometric mode
that averages out fluctuations of the total number of nonequilibrium electrons
created by the photon and drastically reduces jitter. The difference between
Gaussian parts of distributions for these two modes provides the measure for
the electron-number fluctuations. Corresponding standard deviation increases

However, the discriminator usually as- sesses individual samples. This prevents
the dis- criminator from accessing global distributional statistics of
generated samples, and often leads to mode dropping: the generator models only
part of the target distribution. We propose to feed the discriminator with
mixed batches of true and fake samples, and train it to predict the ratio of
true samples in the batch. The latter score does not depend on the order of
samples in a batch. Rather than learning this invariance, we introduce a
generic permutation-invariant discriminator ar- chitecture. This architecture
is provably a uni- versal approximator of all symmetric functions.

astrophysics, but due to their complex physical nature, theoretical models are
essential to understand better these exploding stars, as well as the properties
of the variation of the emitted radiation. One possibility for modeling SNe
light curves is the construction of a simplified semi-analytic model, which can
be used for getting order-of magnitude estimates of the SN properties. One of
the strongest simplification in most of these light curve models is the
assumption of the constant Thomson-scattering opacity that can be determined as
the average opacity of the ejecta. Here we present a systematic analysis for
estimating the average opacity in different types of core-collapse supernovae
(CCSNe) that can be used as the constant opacity of the ejecta in simplified
semi-analytic models. To use these average opacities self-consistently during
light curve (LC) fit we estimate their values from hydrodynamic simulations. In
this analysis we first generate MESA (Paxton et al. 2011, 2013, 2015, 2018)
stellar models with different physical parameters (initial mass, metallicity,
rotation), which determine the mass-loss history of the model star. Then we
synthesize SN LCs from these models with the SNEC hydrodynamic code (Morozova
et al. 2015) and calculate the Rosseland mean opacity in every mass element.
Finally, we compute the average opacities by integrating these Rosseland mean
opacities. As a result we find that the average opacities from our calculations
show adequate agreement with the opacities generally used in previous studies.

blockchain can adversely affect user experience and security. Because different
PoW blockchains often share hashing algorithms, miners face a complex choice in
deciding how to allocate their hash power among chains. We present an economic
model that leverages Modern Portfolio Theory to predict a miner's allocation
over time using price data and inferred risk tolerance. The model matches
actual allocations with mean absolute error within 20% for four out of the top
five miners active on both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchains. A
model of aggregate allocation across those four miners shows excellent
agreement in magnitude with the actual aggregate as well a correlation
coefficient of 0.649. The accuracy of the aggregate allocation model is also
sufficient to explain major historical changes in inter-block time (IBT) for
BCH. Because estimates of miner risk are not time-dependent and our model is
otherwise price-driven, we are able to use it to anticipate the effect of a
major price shock on hash allocation and IBT in the BCH blockchain. Using a
Monte Carlo simulation, we show that, despite mitigation by the new difficulty
adjustment algorithm, a price drop of 50% could increase the IBT by 50% for at

preferable as it allows to maintain good tracking performance at low feedback

we address the problem of stable high-performance tracking control for unknown

that allows distrusting parties to compute a function of their individual
inputs, while only revealing the output of the function. It has found
applications in areas such as auctioning, email filtering, and secure
teleconference. Given its importance, it is crucial that the protocols are
specified and implemented correctly. In the programming language community it
has become good practice to use computer proof assistants to verify correctness
proofs. In the field of cryptography, EasyCrypt is the state of the art proof
assistant. It provides an embedded language for probabilistic programming,
together with a specialized logic, embedded into an ambient general purpose
higher-order logic. It allows us to conveniently express cryptographic
properties. EasyCrypt has been used successfully on many applications,
including public-key encryption, signatures, garbled circuits and differential
privacy. Here we show for the first time that it can also be used to prove
security of MPC against a malicious adversary. We formalize additive and
replicated secret sharing schemes and apply them to Maurer's MPC protocol for
secure addition and multiplication. Our method extends to general polynomial
functions. We follow the insights from EasyCrypt that security proofs can be
often be reduced to proofs about program equivalence, a topic that is well
understood in the verification of programming languages. In particular, we show
that in the passive case the non-interference-based definition is equivalent to
a standard game-based security definition. For the active case we provide a new
NI definition, which we call input independence.

binary stars and planetary systems and determines the systems evolution towards
the possible equilibrium state. Turbulent friction acting on the equilibrium
tide in the convective envelope of low-mass stars is known to have a strong
impact on this exchange of angular momentum in binaries. Moreover, theoretical
modelling in recent literature as well as presented in this paper suggests that
the dissipation of the dynamical tide, constituted of tidal inertial waves
propagating in the convective envelope, is weak compared to the dissipation of
the equilibrium tide during the red-giant phase. This prediction is confirmed
when we apply the equilibrium-tide formalism developed by Zahn (1977), Verbunt
& Phinney (1995), and Remus, Mathis & Zahn (2012) onto the sample of all known
red-giant binaries observed by the NASA Kepler mission. Moreover, the
observations are adequately explained by only invoking the equilibrium tide
dissipation. Such ensemble analysis also benefits from the seismic
characterisation of the oscillating components and surface rotation rates.
Through asteroseismology, previous claims of the eccentricity as an
evolutionary state diagnostic are discarded. This result is important for our
understanding of the evolution of multiple star and planetary systems during
advanced stages of stellar evolution.

$^{174}$Yb atoms coherently driven on a narrow optical transition. The
excitation transfers the BEC to a superposition of states with different
internal and momentum quantum numbers. We observe a crossover with decreasing
driving strength between a regime of damped oscillations, where coherent
driving prevails, and an incoherent regime, where relaxation takes over.
Several relaxation mechanisms are involved: inelastic losses involving two
excited atoms, leading to a non-exponential decay of populations; Doppler
broadening due to the finite momentum width of the BEC and inhomogeneous
elastic interactions, both leading to dephasing and to damping of the
oscillations. We compare our observations to a two-component Gross-Pitaevskii
(GP) model that fully includes these effects. For small or moderate densities,
the damping of the oscillations is mostly due to Doppler broadening. In this
regime, we find excellent agreement between the model and the experimental
results. For higher densities, the role of interactions increases and so does
the damping rate of the oscillations. The damping in the GP model is less
pronounced than in the experiment, possibly a hint for many-body effects not
captured by the mean-field description.

spaces for solutions of a class of quasilinear degenerate equations with

derivatives of order greater than one of the solutions of the $(p,q)$-Laplacian
operator, under Dirichlet's boundary conditions. As it turns out, even in the
absence of the so-called Lavrentiev phenomenon and without variations on the
order of ellipticity of the equations, the fractional regularity of these
solutions ramifies depending on the interplay between the growth parameters
$p$, $q$ and the data. Indeed, we are going to exploit the absence of this
phenomenon in order to prove the validity up to the boundary of some regularity
results, which are known to hold locally, and as well provide new fractional
regularity for the associated solutions. In turn, there are obtained certain
global regularity results by means of the combination between new a priori
estimates and approximations of the differential operators, whereas the
nonstandard boundary terms are handled by means of a careful choice for the
local frame.

presence of the macromolecule signal or high correlation between metabolite
spectral patterns can cause high uncertainties for most of the metabolites,

In this paper, quantification of metabolites in MR Spectroscopic imaging using

parameters. The proposed model learns the spectral features from a large-scale
simulated data set with different variations of human brain spectra and SNRs.

show informally that the two operations form a discrete ring. The search
landscape of QCC is a two dimensional discrete torus where vertices represent
configurations of how circuit qubits are allocated to NISQ registers. Torus
edges are weighted by the cost of scheduling circuit gates. The novelty of our

scenarios, and the problem presented herein was neglected until now. For
achieving fault-tolerance and implementing surface code based computations, a
significant amount of computing resources (hardware and time) are necessary for
preparing special quantum states in a procedure called distillation. This work
introduces the problem of how distilleries (circuit portions responsible for
state distillation) influence the layout of surface code protected quantum
circuits, and analyses the trade-offs for reducing the resources necessary for
executing the circuits. A first algorithmic solution is presented, implemented
and evaluated for addition quantum circuits.

destination is considered. The sensor is equipped with a battery of finite size
to save its incoming energy, and consumes one unit of energy per status update
transmission, which is delivered to the destination instantly over an
error-free channel. The setting is online in which the harvested energy is
revealed to the sensor causally over time, and the goal is to design status
update transmission policy such that the long term average age of information
(AoI) is minimized. AoI is defined as the time elapsed since the latest update
has reached at the destination. Two energy arrival models are considered: a
random battery recharge (RBR) model, and an incremental battery recharge (IBR)
model. In both models, energy arrives according to a Poisson process with unit
rate, with values that completely fill up the battery in the RBR model, and
with values that fill up the battery incrementally, unit-by-unit, in the IBR
model. The key approach to characterizing the optimal status update policy for
both models is showing the optimality of renewal policies, in which the
inter-update times follow a specific renewal process that depends on the energy
arrival model and the battery size. It is then shown that the optimal renewal
policy has an energy-dependent threshold structure, in which the sensor sends a
status update only if the AoI grows above a certain threshold that depends on
the energy available. For both the RBR and the IBR models, the optimal
energy-dependent thresholds are characterized explicitly, i.e., in closed-form,
in terms of the optimal long term average AoI. It is also shown that the
optimal thresholds are monotonically decreasing in the energy available in the
battery, and that the smallest threshold, which comes in effect when the
battery is full, is equal to the optimal long term average AoI.

fusion. However, due to the lack of labeled data for supervised training of

focused images to simulate defocus and generate synthetic training data with
ground-truth for supervised learning. Moreover, they classify pixels as focused
or defocused and leverage the results to construct the fusion weight maps which
then necessitates a series of post-processing steps. In this paper, we present
unsupervised end-to-end learning for directly predicting the fully focused
output image from multi-focus input image pairs. The proposed approach uses a
novel CNN architecture trained to perform fusion without the need for ground

calculate the loss; a metric that is widely accepted for fused image quality
evaluation. Consequently, we are able to utilize {\em real} benchmark datasets,
instead of simulated ones, to train our network. The model is a feed-forward,
fully convolutional neural network that can process images of variable sizes
during test time. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our

to derive explicit solutions for the linear 3D Euler equations, to build up
different phase spaces by using explicit solutions and analyze the

present significant differences and some of them are surprising. For instance,
in one phase space the stability of the null solution coexists with solutions

theory is the so-called conditional joint typicality lemma. In addition to the
lemma, one often uses unions and intersections of typical sets in the inner
bound arguments without so much as giving them a second thought. These
arguments do not work in the quantum setting. This bottleneck shows up in the
fact that so-called simultaneous decoders, as opposed to successive
cancellation decoders, are known for very few channels in quantum network
information theory. Another manifestation of this bottleneck is the lack of
so-called simultaneous smoothing theorems for quantum states.
  In this paper, we overcome the bottleneck by proving for the first time a
one-shot quantum joint typicality lemma with robust union and intersection
properties. To do so, we develop two novel tools in quantum information theory
which may be of independent interest. The first tool is a simple geometric idea
called tilting, which increases the angles between a family of subspaces in
orthogonal directions. The second tool, called smoothing and augmentation, is a
way of perturbing a multipartite quantum state such that the partial trace over
any subset of registers does not increase the operator norm by much.
  Our joint typicality lemma allows us to construct simultaneous quantum
decoders for many multiterminal quantum channels. It provides a powerful tool
to extend many results in classical network information theory to the one-shot
quantum setting.

carry out a comprehensive study of the chemistry of phosphorus-bearing
molecules across different astrophysical environments which cover a range of
physical conditions (cold molecular dark clouds, warm clouds, hot cores/hot

phenomena (proto-stellar heating, shock waves, intense UV radiation and cosmic

authentication scheme. We propose a solution based on the well-known (k,n)
threshold scheme of Shamir for sharing a secret, where in our case the secret
is the password itself and (k,n) threshold scheme means that n password-derived
secrets (shares) are created and k less than n shares are necessary and
sufficient for reconstructing the password, while k-1 are not sufficient. The
scheme is information-theoretic secure. Since each of the n shares is stored on
a different host (shareholder), an attacker will need to compromise k different
shareholders for obtaining an amount of data sufficient for reconstructing the
secret. Furthermore, in order to be resistant to the compromising of the server
(dealer) coordinating the shareholders we define a variant of the classic
Shamir, where the Shamir's abscissae are unknown to dealer and shareholders,
making the reconstruction impossible even in the case of dealer and
shareholders compromised. In addition we use the Pedersen technique for
allowing the verification of shares. For the described scenario we have
designed two protocols: the registration (user's sign-up, to be carried out
once), and authentication (user's login). We analyse several scenarios where
dealer and/or shareholders are partially/totally compromised and confirm that
none of them is enabling the attacker to break the authentication. Furthermore
we focus on cases where one or more byzantine servers are presented, analysing
the impact on the framework and show the adopted mechanisms to be safe against
these kinds of attacks. We have developed a prototype demonstrating that our
framework works correctly, effectively and efficiently. It provides a first
feasibility study that will provide a base for structured and engineered
cloud-based implementations aiming at providing an authentication-as-a-service.

class (traffic class, application class, user class or other grouping criteria)
and allocate on demand this resource. There is a BAM allocation policy inherent
for each existing model which behaves differently under distinct network state,
such as heavy traffic loads and dynamic traffic and/or application scenarios. A
generalized Bandwidth Allocation Model (G-BAM) is proposed in this paper.
G-BAM, firstly, incorporates the inherent behavior of currently used BAMs such

secondly, proposes a new policy/ behavior allocation in addition to existing

allows a smoother BAM policy transition among existing policy alternatives

focuses on the first characteristics of G-BAM which is to reproduce MAM, RDM

small-scale magnetic activity of the quiet solar atmosphere. Recent
magneto-convection simulations that account for small-scale dynamo action have
provided three-dimensional (3D) models of the solar photosphere characterized
by a high degree of small-scale magnetic activity, similar to that found
through theoretical interpretation of the scattering polarization observed in
the Sr I 4607 \AA\ line. Here we present the results of a novel investigation
of the Hanle effect in this resonance line, based on 3D radiative transfer
calculations in a high-resolution magneto-convection model having most of the
convection zone magnetized close to the equipartition and a surface mean field
strength ${\langle B \rangle}{\approx}170$ G. The Hanle effect produced by the
model's magnetic field depolarizes the zero-field scattering polarization
signals significantly, to the extent that the center-to-limb variation of the
calculated spatially-averaged polarization amplitudes is compatible with the
observations. The standard deviation of the horizontal fluctuations of the
calculated scattering polarization signals is very sensitive to the model's
magnetic field and we find that the predicted spatial variations are
sufficiently sizable so as to be able to detect them, especially with the next
generation of solar telescopes. We find that at all on-disk positions the
theoretical scattering polarization signals are anti-correlated with the
continuum intensity. To facilitate reaching new observational breakthroughs, we
show how the theoretically predicted polarization signals and spatial
variations are modified when deteriorating the signal-to-noise ratio and the
spectral and spatial resolutions of the simulated observations.

differences between the product-search problem and the IR problem of web search
necessitate a different approach in terms of both models and datasets. We first
review the recent state-of-the-art models for web search IR, distinguishing
between two distinct types of model which we call the distributed type and the
local-interaction type. The different types of relevance models developed for
IR have complementary advantages and disadvantages when applied to eCommerce
product search. Further, we explain why the conventional methods for dataset
construction employed in the IR literature fail to produce data which suffices
for training or evaluation of models for eCommerce product search. We explain
how our own approach, applying task modeling techniques to the click-through

consist of applying several of the models from the IR literature to our own
dataset. Empirically, we have established that, when applied to our dataset,
certain models of local-interaction type reduce ranking errors by one-third
compared to the baseline tf-idf. Applied to our dataset, the distributed models
fail to outperform the baseline. As a basis for a deployed system, the

reorganize learned forests to minimize cache misses during classification. The
resulting layout is hierarchical. At low levels, we pack the nodes of multiple
trees into contiguous memory blocks so that each memory access fetches data for
multiple trees. At higher levels, we use leaf cardinality to identify the most
popular paths through a tree and collocate those paths in cache lines. We
extend this layout with out-of-order execution and cache-line prefetching to
increase memory throughput. Together, these optimizations increase the
performance of classification in ensembles by a factor of four over an
optimized C++ implementation and a actor of 50 over a popular R language

numerical solver. Unlike for the Newtonian Riemann problem, where only the
velocity perpendicular to the interface is relevant, in the relativistic case
the tangential velocity becomes coupled through the Lorentz factor and can
alter the waves present in the solution. We investigated whether a fast
tangential velocity may be able to cause a deflagration wave to transition to a

tangential velocities that are a significant fraction of the speed of light or
for systems already on the verge of transitioning. Consequently, it is highly
unlikely that this transition would occur for a burning front in a neutron star

of operational weather forecasting. In this study, we use a simple solar-wind
propagation model to develop the first solar-wind variational DA scheme. This
scheme enables solar-wind observations far from the Sun, such as at 1 AU, to
update and improve the inner boundary conditions of the solar wind model (at
$30$ solar radii). In this way, observational information can be used to
improve estimates of the near-Earth solar wind, even when the observations are
not directly downstream of the Earth. Using controlled experiments with
synthetic observations we demonstrate this method's potential to improve solar
wind forecasts, though the best results are achieved in conjunction with
accurate initial estimates of the solar wind. The variational DA scheme is also
applied to STEREO in-situ observations using initial solar wind conditions
supplied by a coronal model of the observed photospheric magnetic field. We
consider the period Oct 2010-Oct 2011, when the STEREO spacecraft were
approximately $80^{\circ}$ ahead/behind Earth in its orbit. For 12 of 13
Carrington Rotations, assimilation of STEREO data improves the near-Earth solar
wind estimate over the non-assimilated state, with a $18.4\%$ reduction in the
root-mean-squared-error. The largest gains are made by the DA during times when
the steady-state assumption of the coronal models breaks down. While applying
this pure variational approach to complex solar-wind models is technically
challenging, we discuss hybrid DA approaches which are simpler to implement and
may retain many of the advantages demonstrated here.

model, each type of consumers are assigned with a specific period-price
combination. In the latter model, the consumers are first categorized into a
finite number of groups, and each group of consumers (possibly with different
types) are assigned with a specific period-price combination. We systematically
analyze the incentive compatibility (IC) constraint and individual rationality
(IR) constraint, which ensure each consumer to choose the data plan with the
period-price combination intended for his type. We further derive the optimal
contract that maximizes the SP's expected profit, meanwhile satisfying the IC
and IR constraints of consumers. Our numerical results show that the proposed
optimal contract can increase the SP's profit by 35%, comparing with the
conventional fixed monthly-period data plan.

broader range of synchrotron peak frequencies. Each AGN has been observed for
at least five epochs between 1996 and 2017. We find that BL Lac objects have
core electric vector position angles (EVPAs) which tend towards alignment with
the local jet direction; compared to flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), their
EVPAs are also less variable over time. The AGN cores which are most
fractionally polarized and least variable in polarization have EVPAs that are
closely aligned with the local jet direction; they also have low variability in
EVPA. These results support the popular model of a standing transverse shock at
the base of the jet which collimates the jet magnetic field perpendicular to
the jet direction, increasing the fractional polarization and leading to
greater polarization stability over time. High-synchrotron-peaked (HSP) BL Lac
objects form a low luminosity, low fractional polarization population. The five
narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies in our sample have low fractional polarization
and large EVPA-jet misalignments. Although AGN detected at gamma-rays are
thought to be more Doppler boosted than non-detected AGN, we find no
significant differences in fractional polarization based on detection by
Fermi-LAT; the gamma-loud AGN are, however, more variable in core EVPAs.

errors when using the linear regression model to estimate some

The principle focus is on the influence of the neutrals on the filament through

Both direct and indirect interactions influence the motion of filaments. A
monotonic increase of filament peak velocity with upstream electron temperature
is observed, while a decrease with increasing electron density is observed. If
ordered by the target temperature, the density dependence disappears and the
filament velocity is only a function of the target temperature. Smaller
filaments keep a density dependence, as a result of the density dependence of
the plasma viscosity. The critical size $\delta^*$, where filaments are
fastest, is shifted to larger sizes for higher densities, due to the plasma
viscosity. If the density dependence of the plasma viscosity is removed,
$\delta^*$ has no temperature dependence, but rather a density dependence.

Moreover, by exploiting information from multiple neuroimaging modalities or

embedding learned from an individual view. Therefore, multi-view multi-graph
embedding becomes a crucial task. Currently, only a few studies have been

relevant task in computer vision using a non-invasive approach. Standard and
current approaches typically derive gait signatures from sequences of binary

large amount of non-stationary noise, thus, conditioning their efficacy. In
contrast, in this paper we focus on the raw pixels, or simple functions derived
from them, letting advanced learning techniques to extract relevant features.
Therefore, we present a comparative study of different Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) architectures by using three different modalities (i.e. gray
pixels, optical flow channels and depth maps) on two widely-adopted and
challenging datasets: TUM-GAID and CASIA-B. In addition, we perform a
comparative study between different early and late fusion methods used to
combine the information obtained from each kind of modalities. Our experimental
results suggest that (i) the raw pixel values represent a competitive input
modality, compared to the traditional state-of-the-art silhouette-based
features (e.g. GEI), since equivalent or better results are obtained; (ii) the
fusion of the raw pixel information with information from optical flow and
depth maps allows to obtain state-of-the-art results on the gait recognition
task with an image resolution several times smaller than the previously
reported results; and, (iii) the selection and the design of the CNN
architecture are critical points that can make a difference between
state-of-the-art results or poor ones.

block that models correlations between channels of a 3D CNN with respect to
temporal and spatial features. This new block can be added as a residual unit
to different parts of 3D CNNs. We name our novel block 'Spatio-Temporal Channel

about training them from scratch with a huge labeled dataset to get a
reasonable performance. So the knowledge learned in 2D CNNs is completely
ignored. Another contribution in this work is a simple and effective technique
to transfer knowledge from a pre-trained 2D CNN to a randomly initialized 3D
CNN for a stable weight initialization. This allows us to significantly reduce
the number of training samples for 3D CNNs. Thus, by fine-tuning this network,
we beat the performance of generic and recent methods in 3D CNNs, which were
trained on large video datasets, e.g. Sports-1M, and fine-tuned on the target

correspond to the so-called ""static gauges"". Using this language I find that
the so-called ""generator criterion"" does not generally hold even for the

the standard GIE construction to include the matter field degrees of freedom so
that the usual separation pattern of momentum and angular momentum in the
unitarity gauge can be incorporated into the same universal framework. When the
static gauge condition could not uniquely fix the gauge, I show that this GIE
construction should be expanded to take into account the residual gauge
symmetry. In some cases I reveal that the usual momentum or angular momentum
separation pattern in terms of the physical dressed field variables needs some
type of modification due to the nontrivial commutator structure of the
underlying quantum gauge choice. Finally, I give some remarks on the general

by phase errors arising from fabrication imperfections. Due to coherent
interactions, unwanted phase-shifts result in detrimental destructive
interferences that distort the filter response, whatever the chosen strategy
(resonators, interferometers, Bragg filters, etc.). Here we propose and
experimentally demonstrate a radically different approach to overcome this

non-coherent interaction among modal-engineered waveguide Bragg gratings
separated by single-mode waveguides to yield effective cascading, even in the

analogous to Cooper pairs are considered. As in the BCS theory, the description
of a TI-bipolaron gas is based on the electron-phonon interaction and Froehlich
Hamiltonian. As distinct from the BCS theory, when the correlation length
greatly exceeds the mean distance between the pairs, here we deal with the
opposite case when the correlation length is much less than the distance
between the pairs. We calculate the critical temperature of the transition of a
TI-bipolaron Bose-gas into the superconducting state, its energy, heat capacity
and heat of the transition. The results obtained are used to explain the
experiments on high-temperature superconductors. Possible ways of raising the
critical temperature of high-temperature superconductors are discussed.

variation regularization in order to recover discontinuities in the data while
also removing noise and other artifacts. Total variation regularization has
been successful in recovering images for (noisy) Abel transformed data, where
object boundaries and data support will lead to sharp edges in the
reconstructed image. In this work, we analyze the behavior of BV solutions to
the Abel inverse problem, deriving a priori estimates on the recovery. In
particular, we provide L2-stability bounds on BV solutions to the Abel inverse
problem. These bounds yield error estimates on images reconstructed from a
proposed total variation regularized minimization problem.

wide slits which allow light to pass through them. A continuous light beam,
after passing through the rotating disc, is switched-on and switched-off
periodically, and a series of optical pulses are produced. The intensity of
each pulse is expected to rise and fall smoothly with time. However, a careful
study has revealed that the edges of mechanically chopped laser light pulses
consist of periodic intensity undulations which can be detected with a photo
detector. It has been shown in this paper that the intensity undulations in
mechanically chopped laser pulses are produced by diffraction of light from the
rotating disc and a detailed explanation of the intensity undulations is given.
The experiment provides an efficient method to capture a one dimensional
diffraction profile of light from a straight sharp-edge in the time domain. In

of Mercury,energetic electrons are often found near current sheets (CSs), which
hints at electron acceleration by magnetic reconnection. Unfortunately,
electron acceleration by reconnection is not well understood, yet. In
particular, acceleration by turbulent plasmoid reconnection. We have
investigated electron acceleration by turbulent plasmoid reconnection,
described by MHD simulations, via test particle calculations. In order to avoid
resolving all relevant turbulence scales down to the dissipation scales, a
mean-field turbulence model is used to describe the turbulence of sub-grid
scales (SGS) and their effects via a turbulent electromotive force (EMF). The
mean-field model describes the turbulent EMF as a function of the mean values
of current density, vorticity, magnetic field as well as of the energy,
cross-helicity and residual helicity of the turbulence. We found that, mainly
around X-points of turbulent reconnection, strongly enhanced localized EMFs
most efficiently accelerated electrons and caused the formation of power-law
spectra. Magnetic-field-aligned EMFs, caused by the turbulence, dominate the
electron acceleration process. Scaling the acceleration processes to parameters
of the Hermean magnetotail, electron energies up to 60 keV can be reached by
turbulent plasmoid reconnection through the thermal plasma.

propagating in grease-pancake ice covered ocean is investigated. In particular,
the Keller's model Keller [1998], the two-layer viscous model [De Carolis and
Desiderio 2002] and the close-packing model [De Santi and Olla 2017] are
extensively validated by using wave attenuation data collected during two
different field campaigns (Weddell Sea, Antarctica, April 2000; western Arctic
Ocean, autumn 2015).
  We use these data to validate the three models by minimizing the differences
between the measured and model wave attenuation; the retrieved ice thickness is
then compared with measured data.
  The three models allow to fit the observation data, but with important
differences in the three cases. The close-packing model shows good agreement
with the data for values of the ice viscosity comparable to those of grease ice
in laboratory experiments. For thin ice, the Keller's model performance is
similar to that of the close-packing model, while for thick ice much larger
values of the ice viscosity are required, which reflects the different ability
of the two models to take into account the effect of pancakes. The improvement
of performance over the Keller's model achieved by the two-layer viscous model
is minimal, which reflects the marginal role in the dynamics of a finite eddy
viscosity in the ice-free layer. A good ice thickness retrieval can be obtained
by considering the ice layer as the only source in the wave dynamics, so that
the wind input can be disregarded.

electrolytes are formed by dispersing imidazolium ionic liquid functionalized
TiO2 nanoparticles in low conducting, 0.6 M lithium salt doped
N-alkyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Pyr14TFSI)
ionic liquid (IL) hosted electrolyte. Viscosity, ionic conductivity and thermal
properties of these electrolytes are compared with well studied 0.2 M salt
doped Pyr14TFSI IL-based electrolyte. The highly crystalline 0.6 M lithium salt
dissolved IL-based electrolytes gradually become amorphous with the increasing
dispersion of surface functionalized nanoparticles within it. The ionic
conductivity of the electrolytes shows unusual viscosity decoupled
characteristics and at the 5.0 wt% nanoparticle dispersion it attains a maximum
value, higher than that of pure IL host. As compared to pure IL-based
electrolytes, the ionanofluid electrolyte also possesses a significantly higher
value of lithium ion transference number. The Li/LiMn2O4 cell with the best
conducting ionanofluid electrolyte delivers a discharge capacity of about 131
mAh g-1 at 25 degree C at a current density of 24 mA g-1, much higher than that
obtained in 0.2 M Li salt dissociated Pyr14TFSI electrolyte (87 mAh g-1).
Superior interfacial compatibility between ionanofluid electrolyte and
electrodes as indicated by the excellent rate performance with outstanding
capacity retention of the cell as compared to pure IL-based analogue, further
establish great application potentiality of this optimized newly developed
electrolyte for safer LMBs.
