  Life-Span",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Principles of network topology have been widely studied in the human
connectome. Of particular interest is the modularity of the human brain, where
the connectome is divided into subnetworks and subsequently changes with
development, aging or disease are investigated. We present a weighted network
measure, the Network Dependency Index (NDI), to identify an individual region's
importance to the global functioning of the network. Importantly, we utilize
NDI to differentiate four subnetworks (Tiers) in the human connectome following
Gaussian Mixture Model fitting. We analyze the topological aspects of each
subnetwork with respect to age and compare it to rich-club based subnetworks
(rich-club, feeder and seeder). Our results first demonstrate the efficacy of
NDI to identify more consistent, central nodes of the connectome across
age-groups, when compared to the rich-club framework. Stratifying the
connectome by NDI led to consistent subnetworks across the life-span revealing
distinct patterns associated with age where, e.g., the key relay nuclei and
cortical regions are contained in a subnetwork with highest NDI. The divisions
of the human connectome derived from our data-driven NDI framework have the
potential to reveal topological alterations described by network measures
through the life-span.

In particular, the activation strength and extent of neurons are studied to

method identifies where a brand stands in the spectrum of branding strategy,
i.e., from trademark-emblazoned goods with bold logos to implicit no logo
marketing. By quantifying attention maps, we are able to interpret the visual
characteristics of a brand present in a single image and model the general
design direction of a brand as a whole. We further investigate versatility of
neurons and discover ""specialists"" that are highly brand-specific and
""generalists"" that detect diverse visual features. A human experiment based on
three main visual scenarios of fashion brands is conducted to verify the
alignment of our quantitative measures with the human perception of brands.

several challenges, due to the high dimensionality, low sample size and complex

act as as black-box models, impeding insight into the association of cognitive
state and brain activity. To approach these challenges, we introduce the
DeepLight framework, which utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) based DL
models to analyze whole-brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
data. To decode a cognitive state (e.g., seeing the image of a house),
DeepLight separates the fMRI volume into a sequence of axial brain slices,
which is then sequentially processed by an LSTM. To maintain interpretability,
DeepLight adapts the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique. Thereby,
decomposing its decoding decision into the contributions of the single input
voxels to this decision. Importantly, the decomposition is performed on the
level of single fMRI volumes, enabling DeepLight to study the associations
between cognitive state and brain activity on several levels of data
granularity, from the level of the group down to the level of single time
points. To demonstrate the versatility of DeepLight, we apply it to a large
fMRI dataset of the Human Connectome Project. We show that DeepLight
outperforms conventional approaches of uni- and multivariate fMRI analysis in
decoding the cognitive states and in identifying the physiologically
appropriate brain regions associated with these states. We further demonstrate
DeepLight's ability to study the fine-grained temporo-spatial variability of

verify that scaffolding takes place when a human teaches a robot, and to let a

the robot to detect changes in utterance and rewards given by the partner and
continue learning accordingly. Experimental results demonstrated that
participants who continued interaction for a sufficiently long time often gave
scaffolding for the robot. Although the number of experiments is still
insufficient to obtain a definite conclusion, we observed that 1) the robot
quickly learned to respond to DAs in most cases if the participants only spoke
utterances that match the situation, 2) in the case of participants who builds
scaffolding differently from what we assumed, learning did not proceed quickly,
and 3) the robot could learn to estimate DAs almost exactly if the participants
kept interaction for a sufficiently long time even if the scaffolding was
unexpected.

different human drivers on a driving simulator. The benefits of introducing the
proposed protocol are evaluated in terms of travel time, energy consumption,

reduce energy consumption and pollutant emissions by 8% and 58%, respectively,

crossing can be detected through the transconductance quantization, in units of

another example of topology in multi-terminal Josephson junctions. We discuss
possible realizations of such junctions with semiconducting crossed nanowires

M87 jet is likely powered by the spinning BH. Our GRMHD simulations also
indicate a lateral stratification of the bulk acceleration (i.e., the

transition from source to sink. Because transient non-equilibrium behavior is
quantified in some modern path sampling approaches, such as the ""weighted

$J_{ss}$ is bounded from above and below by the maximum and minimum,
respectively, of the current as a function of the spatial coordinate at any
time $t$ for one-dimensional systems undergoing over-damped Langevin (i.e.,
Smoluchowski) dynamics and for higher-dimensional Smoluchowski systems
satisfying certain assumptions when projected onto a single dimension. These
bounds become tighter with time, making them of potential practical utility in
a scheme for estimating $J_{ss}$ and the long-timescale kinetics of complex
systems. Conceptually, the bounds result from the fact that extrema of the
transient currents relax toward the steady-state current.

  https://github.com/brett-daley/dqn-lambda",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern deep reinforcement learning methods have departed from the incremental
learning required for eligibility traces, rendering the implementation of the
$\lambda$-return difficult in this context. In particular, off-policy methods
that utilize experience replay remain problematic because their random sampling
of minibatches is not conducive to the efficient calculation of
$\lambda$-returns. Yet replay-based methods are often the most sample
efficient, and incorporating $\lambda$-returns into them is a viable way to
achieve new state-of-the-art performance. Towards this, we propose the first
method to enable practical use of $\lambda$-returns in arbitrary replay-based
methods without relying on other forms of decorrelation such as asynchronous
gradient updates. By promoting short sequences of past transitions into a small
cache within the replay memory, adjacent $\lambda$-returns can be efficiently
precomputed by sharing Q-values. Computation is not wasted on experiences that
are never sampled, and stored $\lambda$-returns behave as stable
temporal-difference (TD) targets that replace the target network. Additionally,
our method grants the unique ability to observe TD errors prior to sampling;
for the first time, transitions can be prioritized by their true significance
rather than by a proxy to it. Furthermore, we propose the novel use of the TD
error to dynamically select $\lambda$-values that facilitate faster learning.
We show that these innovations can enhance the performance of DQN when playing
Atari 2600 games, even under partial observability. While our work specifically
focuses on $\lambda$-returns, these ideas are applicable to any multi-step

strontium or ytterbium) also inherit the peculiar properties of these atomic
species, above all the possibility to access metastable electronic states via
direct excitation on optical clock transitions with ultimate sensitivity and
accuracy. In this paper we report on the production and coherent manipulation
of molecular bound states of two fermionic $^{173}$Yb atoms in different
electronic (orbital) states $^1$S$_0$ and $^3$P$_0$ in proximity of a
scattering resonance involving atoms in different spin and electronic states,

coherently photoassociated starting from a gas of ground-state atoms in a
three-dimensional optical lattices by observing several photoassociation and
photodissociation cycles. We also show the possibility to coherently control
the molecular internal state by using Raman-assisted transfer to swap the
nuclear spin of one of the atoms forming the molecule, thus demonstrating a
powerful manipulation and detection tool of these molecular bound states.
Finally, by exploiting this peculiar detection technique we provide first

centrality that conforms with its corresponding graph-theoretical centrality
formulation. Moreover, the uniqueness is fully determined by the centrality
formulation on the class of layered graphs, which is derived from a beautiful
algebraic structure of influence instances modeled by cascading sequences. Our
main mathematical result that layered graphs in fact form a basis for the space
of influence-cascading-sequence profiles could also be useful in other studies
of network influences. We further provide an algorithmic framework for
efficient approximation of these influence-based centrality measures.
  Our study provides a systematic road map for comparative analyses of
different influence-based centrality formulations, as well as for transferring
graph-theoretical concepts to influence models.

is the absence of flavor-exotic states of the type $\bar a b\bar c d$, with
four different quark flavors. This phenomenon may be understood from the
properties of large-$N_c$ QCD: On the one hand, consistency conditions for
flavor-exotic Green functions, potentially containing these tetraquark poles,
require the existence of two tetraquarks $T_A$ and $T_B$: each of them should
decay dominantly via a single two-meson channel, $T_A\to M_{\bar a b}M_{\bar c
d}$ and $T_B\to M_{\bar a d}M_{\bar c b}$, with suppressed rates $T_A\to
M_{\bar a d}M_{\bar c b}$ and $T_B\to M_{\bar a b}M_{\bar c d}$. On the other
hand, we have at hand only one diquark-antidiquark flavor structure $(\bar a
\bar c)(b d)$ that might produce a compact tetraquark bound state. Taking into
account that the diquark-antidiquark structure is the only viable candidate for
a compact tetraquark state, one concludes that it is impossible to have two
different narrow tetraquarks decaying dominantly into different two-meson
channels. This contradiction suggests that large-$N_c$ QCD does not support the
existence of narrow flavor-exotic tetraquarks. This argument does not rule out
the possible existence of broad molecular-type flavor-exotic states, or of
molecular-type bound states lying very close to the two-meson thresholds.

assigned to workers in order to tolerate stragglers. We consider sequential
computation of tasks assigned to a worker, while the result of each computation
is sent to the master right after its completion. Each computation round, which
can model an iteration of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, is
completed once the master receives k distinct computations, referred to as the
computation target. Our goal is to characterize the average completion time as
a function of the computation load, which denotes the portion of the dataset
available at each worker, and the computation target. We propose two
computation scheduling schemes that specify the tasks assigned to each worker,
as well as their computation schedule, i.e., the order of execution. Assuming a
general statistical model for computation and communication delays, we derive
the average completion time of the proposed schemes. We also establish a lower
bound on the minimum average completion time by assuming prior knowledge of the
random delays. Experimental results carried out on Amazon EC2 cluster show a
significant reduction in the average completion time over existing coded and

unknown domains. Several examples can easily be found in the dynamics of free
interfaces in fluid dynamics, solid mechanics or in fluid-solid interactions.
To solve these equations in an arbitrary domain with nonlinear deformations, we
propose a mathematical approach allowing to track the boundary of the domain,
analogue of, and complementary to, the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)
method for the interior of the domain. We name this method as the Boundary
Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (BALE) method. Additionally, in many situations
nonlinear deformations can be avoided with the help of some analyses which rely
on small deformations of the boundary, such as stability analysis, asymptotic
expansion and gradient-based shape optimisation. For these cases, we propose an
approach to perturb the domain and its boundaries and write the partial
differential equations at the unperturbed domain together with the boundary
conditions at the unperturbed boundary, instead of at the perturbed ones, which
are a priori unknown. We name this method as the Deformable Boundary
Perturbation (DBP) method. These two proposed methods rely on the boundary
exterior differential operator, whose relevant properties for the present work

  Results: We provide quantitative predictions of how the line ratios from HII

line ratios reinforces the hypothesis that the DIG is ionized by (filtered)
radiation from hot stars; however, comparison of observed and predicted line
ratios indicates that the DIG is typically ionized with a softer SED than
predicted by the chosen stellar population synthesis model. Even small changes
in simulation parameters like the clumping factor can lead to considerable
variation in the ionized volume. Both for a more homogeneous gas and a very
inhomogeneous gas containing both dense clumps and channels with low gas
density, the ionized region in the dilute gas above the galactic plane can
cease to be radiation-bounded, allowing the ionizing radiation to leak into the

gas, is critical for the thermodynamic evolution and star-formation histories
in early protogalaxies. Determining the photodissociation rate of H2 by an
incident Lyman-Werner (LW) flux is thus crucial, but prohibitively expensive to
calculate on the fly in simulations. The rate is sensitive to the H2
rovibrational distribution, which in turn depends on the gas density,
temperature, and incident LW radiation field. We use the publicly available
cloudy package to model primordial gas clouds and compare exact
photodissociation rate calculations to commonly-used fitting formulae. We find
the fit from Wolcott-Green et al. (2011) is most accurate for moderate
densities n~10^3 cm^{-3} and temperatures, T~10^3K, and we provide a new fit,
which captures the increase in the rate at higher densities and temperatures,
owing to the increased excited rovibrational populations in this regime. Our
new fit has typical errors of a few percent percent up to n =<10^7 cm^{-3}, T
=< 8000K, and H2 column density NH2 =<10^{17} cm^{-2}, and can be easily
utilized in simulations. We also show that pumping of the excited rovibrational
states of H2 by a strong LW flux further modifies the level populations when
the gas density is low, and noticeably decreases self-shielding for J_21 > 10^3

high-mass ultra compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) suggests that at least some UCDs
are the stripped nuclear star clusters of lower mass galaxies. Tracing these
former nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track the assembly
history of a galaxy or galaxy cluster. In this paper we present a new method to
estimate how many UCDs host an SMBH in their center and thus are stripped
galaxy nuclei. We revisit the dynamical mass measurements that suggest many
UCDs have more mass than expected from stellar population estimates, which
recent observations have shown is due to the presence of an SMBH. We revise the
stellar population mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the
mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity, and use this to predict which UCDs
are most likely to host an SMBH. This enables us to calculate the fraction of
UCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time.
We then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function
of UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be
$69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs. This analysis shows that stripped
nuclei with SMBHs are almost as common in clusters as present-day galaxy
nuclei. We estimate the local SMBH number density in stripped nuclei to
$3-8\times10^{-3}Mpc^{-3}$, which represents a significant fraction (10-40\%)
of the SMBH density in the local Universe. These SMBHs hidden in stripped
nuclei will increase expected event rates for tidal disruption events and
SMBH-SMBH and SMBH-BH mergers. The existence of numerous stripped nuclei with
SMBHs are a direct consequence of hierarchical galaxy formation, but until now
their impact on the SMBH density had not been quantified.

investigated using different methods. Our goal is to explicitly compare two of
them: the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) and the gradient technique. Methods. We
have applied the RHT method and the gradient technique to two regions,
identified in surface brightness maps at 353 GHz generated via MHD simulations
post-processed using radiative transfer modelling. For both methods we have
derived the relative orientation between the magnetic field and the density
structures, to which we have applied two different statistics, the histogram of
relative orientation (HRO) statistic and the projected Rayleigh statistic
(PRS). Results. The samples of pixels selected by each method are substantially
different. When the methods are applied to the same pixel selection, the
results in terms of relative orientation as a function of column density are
consistent between each other. When each method is applied to its own pixel
selection, the differences are apparent. In Region 1, the RHT method roughly
reproduces the observed trend of the relative orientation becoming more
perpendicular for increasing column density, while the gradient method, applied
at the same resolution as RHT, gives the opposite trend, with the relative
orientation moving towards a more parallel alignment. In Region 2, the
situation is reversed. The inconsistent results, which are due to the different
pixel selections operated by the methods and to the intrinsic differences
between them, provide complementary valuable information. Abridged.

useful to consider such approximately conserved operators and corresponding new
massive modes within the low-energy effective theory, which we refer to as
quasihydrodynamics. Examples of quasihydrodynamics are numerous, with the most

gradient on planetesimal properties has not been examined in detail. Here, we
use streaming instability simulations that include particle self-gravity to
study how the planetesimal initial mass function depends on the radial pressure
gradient. Fitting our results to a power-law, ${\rm d}N / {\rm d}M_p \propto
M_p^{-p}$, we find a single value $p \approx 1.6$ describes simulations in
which the pressure gradient varies by $\gtrsim 2$. An exponentially truncated
power-law provides a significantly better fit, with a low mass slope of
$p^\prime \approx 1.3$ that weakly depends on the pressure gradient. The
characteristic truncation mass is found to be $\sim M_G = 4 \pi^5 G^2

a linear scaling. These results strengthen the case for a streaming-derived

inclusive cross-sections, according to the famous Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg
theorem which mandates an initial and final state sum. While well-motivated,
this theorem is much weaker than necessary: for finiteness, one need only sum
over initial $\textit{or}$ final states. Moreover, the cancellation generically
requires the inclusion of the forward scattering process. We provide a number
of examples showing the importance of this revised understanding: in $e^+e^-
\to Z$ at next-to-leading order, one can sum over certain initial and final
states with an arbitrary number of extra photons, or only over final states
with a finite number of photons, if forward scattering is included. For Compton
scattering, infrared finiteness requires the indistinguishability of hard
forward-scattered electrons and photons. This implies that in addition to
experimental limits on the energy and angular resolution, there must also be an
experimental limit on the momentum at which electric charge can be observed.
Similar considerations are required to explain why the rate for $\gamma \gamma$
to scatter into photons alone is infrared divergent but the rate for $\gamma
\gamma$ to scatter into photons or charged particles is finite. This new
understanding sheds light on the importance of including degenerate initial
states in physical predictions, the relevance of disconnected Feynman diagrams,
the importance of dressing initial or final-state charged particles, and the
quest to properly define the $S$ matrix.

(SSFR) in cluster and field environments in the redshift range $0.5<z<1.0$.
Recent studies have shown that these galaxies are strongly depleted in dense
environments due to rapid environmental quenching, giving rise to
post-starburst galaxies (PSBs). We use effective radii and S\'ersic indices as
tracers of galaxy structure, determined using imaging from the UKIDSS Ultra
Deep Survey (UDS). We find that the high-SSFR galaxies that survive into the
cluster environment have, on average, larger effective radii than those in the
field. We suggest that this trend is likely to be driven by the most compact
star-forming galaxies being preferentially quenched in dense environments. We
also show that the PSBs in clusters have stellar masses and effective radii
that are similar to the missing compact star-forming population, suggesting
that these PSBs are the result of size-dependent quenching. We propose that
both strong stellar feedback and the stripping of the extended halo act
together to preferentially and rapidly quench the compact and low-mass
star-forming systems in clusters to produce PSBs. We test this scenario using
the stacked spectra of 124 high-SSFR galaxies, showing that more compact
galaxies are more likely to host outflows. We conclude that a combination of
environmental and secular processes is the most likely explanation for the
appearance of PSBs in galaxy clusters.

based on an effective energy deposition into the central halo with an origin
that is either based on baryonic physics (e.g. supernova-driven gas blowouts;
SNF) or on new DM physics (e.g. self-interacting DM, SIDM). We argue that the
fundamental difference between the two is whether the process is impulsive or
adiabatic, and explore novel ways to distinguishing them by looking at the
response of stellar orbits. We perform idealised simulations of tracers
embedded in a $1.48\times 10^{10}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ spherical halo, and model the
creation of a $\sim1$kpc DM matter core in SIDM with $\sigma_T/m_{\chi} =
2\,{\rm cm}^2{\rm g}^{-1}$ and through SNF by impulsively removing a mass
equivalent to $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ of the halo's potential energy. Choosing
idealised initial orbital configurations for the tracers, we find that radial
actions are conserved (changed) in the SIDM (impulsive) case. The adiabaticity
of the SIDM case prevents tracers from changing their orbital family during
core formation whereas SNF separates tracers of initially the same family to a
variety of orbits. We show that these key features remain in a cosmological
halo, albeit for a few dynamical timescales. The number density and velocity
dispersion profile of a Plummer sphere with $r_{1/2} = 500$ pc change only
marginally under adiabatic core formation, whereas SNF causes a substantial
expansion of the sphere driving it out of Jeans equilibrium. Our results point
towards promising ways of differentiating adiabatic from impulsive core
formation.

have been demonstrated in microwave cavities. Nevertheless, architectures based
on quantum memories need a qubit element for addressing these harmonic modules
at the cost of introducing additional loss channels and limiting process
fidelities. This work focuses on tailoring the oscillator Hilbert space to
enable a direct Rabi drive on individual energy levels. For this purpose we
implement a flux-tunable inductive coupling between two linear resonators using
a superconducting quantum interference device. We dynamically activate a
three-wave mixing process through parametric flux modulation in order to
selectively address the lowest eigenstates as an isolated two-level system.
Measuring the Wigner function confirms we can prepare arbitrary states confined
in the single photon manifold, with measured coherence times limited by the
oscillator intrinsic quality factor. This architectural shift in engineering
oscillators with stimulated nonlinearity can be exploited for designing
long-lived quantum modules and offers flexibility in studying non-equilibrium

direct numerical simulations. The balance of Reynolds to viscous stresses
within the canopy is observed to be similar to that over a smooth wall. From
this, a scaling based on their local sum is proposed. Using the conventional
scaling based on the total stress, the velocity fluctuations are typically
reported to be reduced within the canopy compared to smooth walls. When the
proposed height-dependent scaling is used, however, the fluctuations are closer
to those over smooth walls. This suggests that, in a large part, the effect of
the canopy can be reduced to the modification of the local scaling, rather than
to the direct interaction of the canopy elements with the turbulence. Based on
this, a model is proposed that consists of a drag that acts on the mean flow
alone, aiming to produce the correct scaling without modifying the fluctuations
directly. This model is shown to estimate the fluctuations within the canopy
better than the conventional, homogeneous-drag model. Nevertheless, homogenised
methods are not able to reproduce the local effects of the canopy elements. In
order to capture these, another model is proposed that applies the mean-only
drag on a truncated representation of the canopy geometry.

introducing a separate detector to attempt to detect adversarial examples. This

that have tried to make models more robust, with our technique, an adversary
can craft adversarial examples with no knowledge of the defense. For defenses
that attempt to detect the adversarial examples, with our technique, an
adversary only needs very limited information about the defense to craft
adversarial examples. We demonstrate our technique by applying it against two
defenses which make models more robust and two defenses which detect

edges to outbound edges becomes invalid when each vertex participates in
multiple communities. Such a behavior is commonplace in social networks. The
significant overlaps among communities make most existing community detection
algorithms ineffective. The lack of effective and efficient tools resulted in
very few empirical studies on large-scale detection and analyses of overlapping
community structure in real social networks. We developed recently a scalable
and accurate method called the Partial Community Merger Algorithm (PCMA) with
linear complexity and demonstrated its effectiveness by analyzing two online
social networks, Sina Weibo and Friendster, with 79.4 and 65.6 million
vertices, respectively. Here, we report in-depth analyses of the 2.9 million
communities detected by PCMA to uncover their complex overlapping structure.
Each community usually overlaps with a significant number of other communities
and has far more outbound edges than internal edges. Yet, the communities
remain well separated from each other. Most vertices in a community are
multi-membership vertices, and they can be at the core or the peripheral.
Almost half of the entire network can be accounted for by an extremely dense
network of communities, with the communities being the vertices and the
overlaps being the edges. The empirical findings ask for rethinking the notion
of community, especially the boundary of a community. Realizing that it is how
the edges are organized that matters, the f-core is suggested as a suitable
concept for overlapping community in social networks. The results shed new
light on the understanding of overlapping community.

the most dense regions of the intergalactic medium, so their number density and
evolution at high redshift, just after reionisation, are important to
constrain. We present a survey for LLSs at high redshifts, $z_{\rm LLS}
=3.5$--5.4, in the homogeneous dataset of 153 optical quasar spectra at $z \sim
5$ from the Giant Gemini GMOS survey. Our analysis includes detailed
investigation of survey biases using mock spectra which provide important
corrections to the raw measurements. We estimate the incidence of LLSs per unit
redshift at $z \approx 4.4$ to be $\ell(z) = 2.6 \pm 0.4$. Combining our
results with previous surveys at $z_{\rm LLS} <4$, the best-fit power-law
evolution is $\ell(z) = \ell_* [(1+z)/4]^\alpha$ with $\ell_* = 1.46 \pm 0.11$
and $\alpha = 1.70 \pm 0.22$ (68\% confidence intervals). Despite hints in
previous $z_{\rm LLS} <4$ results, there is no indication for a deviation from
this single power-law soon after reionization. Finally, we integrate our new
results with previous surveys of the intergalactic and circumgalactic media to
constrain the hydrogen column density distribution function, $f(N_{\rm HI},X)$,
over 10 orders of magnitude. The data at $z \sim 5$ are not well described by
the $f(N_{\rm HI},X)$ model previously reported for $z \sim 2$--3 (after
re-scaling) and a 7-pivot model fitting the full $z \sim 2$--5 dataset is
statistically unacceptable. We conclude that there is significant evolution in
the shape of $f(N_{\rm HI},X)$ over this $\sim$2 billion year period.

frequently incompletely observed. To address this, several methods have been
proposed for the semiparametric proportional cause-specific hazards model under
a missing at random assumption. However, these proposals provide inference for
the regression coefficients only, and do not consider the infinite dimensional
parameters, such as the covariate-specific cumulative incidence function.
Nevertheless, the latter quantity is essential for risk prediction in modern
medicine. In this paper we propose a unified framework for inference about both
the regression coefficients of the proportional cause-specific hazards model
and the covariate-specific cumulative incidence functions under missing at
random cause of failure. Our approach is based on a novel computationally
efficient maximum pseudo-partial-likelihood estimation method for the
semiparametric proportional cause-specific hazards model. Using modern
empirical process theory we derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed
estimators for the regression coefficients and the covariate-specific
cumulative incidence functions, and provide methodology for constructing
simultaneous confidence bands for the latter. Simulation studies show that our
estimators perform well even in the presence of a large fraction of missing
cause of failures, and that the regression coefficient estimator can be
substantially more efficient compared to the previously proposed augmented
inverse probability weighting estimator. The method is applied using data from
an HIV cohort study and a bladder cancer clinical trial.

advantage of more training data and more GPUs. LM plays a key role in many
important natural language applications such as speech recognition and machine
translation. Scaling up LM is important since it is widely accepted by the
community that there is no data like more data. Eventually, we would like to
train on terabytes (TBs) of text (trillions of words). Modern training methods
are far from this goal, because of various bottlenecks, especially memory
(within GPUs) and communication (across GPUs). This paper shows how Zipf's Law
can address these bottlenecks by grouping parameters for common words and
character sequences, because $U \ll N$, where $U$ is the number of unique words
(types) and $N$ is the size of the training set (tokens). For a local batch
size $K$ with $G$ GPUs and a $D$-dimension embedding matrix, we reduce the
original per-GPU memory and communication asymptotic complexity from
$\Theta(GKD)$ to $\Theta(GK + UD)$. Empirically, we find $U \propto

6.7$\times$ (for character LMs) and 6.3$\times$ (for word LMs) with negligible

if $G$ admits a $1$-rotational $2$-factorization, then the involutions of $G$
are pairwise conjugate. We extend their result by showing that if a finite
group $G$ admits a $1$-rotational $k=2^nm$-factorization where $n\geq 1$, and
$m$ is odd, then $G$ has at most $m(2^n-1)$ conjugacy classes containing
involutions. Also, we show that if $G$ has exactly $m(2^n-1)$ conjugacy classes
containing involutions, then the product of a central involution with an
involution in one conjugacy class yields an involution in a different conjugacy
class. We then demonstrate a method of constructing a $1$-rotational

technological infrastructures. For flow networks in many scenarios, such as
rivers or blood vessels, acyclic networks (i.e., trees) are optimal structures
when assuming time-independent in- and outflow. Dropping this assumption,
fluctuations of net flow at source and/or sink nodes may render the pure tree
solutions unstable even under a simple local adaptation rule for conductances.
Here, we consider tree-like networks under the influence of spatially
heterogeneous distribution of fluctuations, where the root of the tree is
supplied by a constant source and the leaves at the bottom are equipped with
sinks with fluctuating loads. We find that the network divides into two regions
characterized by tree-like motifs and stable cycles. The cycles emerge through
transcritical bifurcations at a critical amplitude of fluctuation. For a simple
network structure, depending on parameters defining the local adaptation,
cycles first appear close to the leaves (or root) and then appear closer
towards the root (or the leaves). The interaction between topology and dynamics
gives rise to complex feedback mechanisms with many open questions in the
theory of network dynamics. A general understanding of the dynamics in adaptive
transport networks is essential in the study of mammalian vasculature, and
adaptive transport networks may find technological applications in
self-organizing piping systems.

We consider the iteration scheme of an algorithm to construct a perturbed
stationary point set-valued map, and define the perturbing parameter by the
difference of two consecutive iterates. Then, we show that the calmness
condition of the induced set-valued map, together with a local version of the
proper separation of stationary value condition, is a sufficient condition to
ensure the linear convergence of the algorithm. The equivalence of the calmness
condition to the one for the canonically perturbed stationary point set-valued
map is proved, and this equivalence allows us to derive some sufficient
conditions for calmness by using some recent developments in variational
analysis. These sufficient conditions are different from existing results
(especially, those error-bound-based ones) in that they can be easily verified
for many concrete application models. Our analysis is focused on the
fundamental proximal gradient (PG) method, and it enables us to show that any
accumulation of the sequence generated by the PG method must be a stationary
point in terms of the proximal subdifferential, instead of the limiting
subdifferential. This result finds the surprising fact that the solution
quality found by the PG method is in general superior. Our analysis also leads
to some improvement for the linear convergence results of the PG method in the
convex case. The new perturbation technique can be conveniently used to derive
linear rate convergence of a number of other first-order methods including the
well-known alternating direction method of multipliers and primal-dual hybrid
gradient method, under mild assumptions.

by constructing an \et ale hypercover for any smooth scheme $X$, refined at
each level to be a disjoint union of open standard smooth subschemes of $X$. We
then find, for large $N$, an $N$-truncated closed embedding into a simplicial
smooth scheme over $W(k)$, which allows us to use the results of \textit{loc.

which can be interpreted in terms of its overall composition. Any measure of
the radial mass distribution provides a first step in constraining the interior
structure. The fluid Love number $k_2$ provides such a measure, and estimates
of $k_2$ for extrasolar planets are expected to be available in the coming
years thanks to improved observational facilities and the ever-extending
temporal baseline of extrasolar planet observations.
  Aims. We derive a method for calculating the Love numbers $k_n$ of any object
given its density profile, which is routinely calculated from interior
structure codes.
  Methods. We used the matrix-propagator technique, a method frequently used in
the geophysical community.
  Results. We detail the calculation and apply it to the case of GJ 436b, a
classical example of the degeneracy of mass-radius relationships, to illustrate
how measurements of $k_2$ can improve our understanding of the interior
structure of extrasolar planets. We implemented the method in a code that is
fast, freely available, and easy to combine with preexisting interior structure
codes. While the linear approach presented here for the calculation of the Love
numbers cannot treat the presence of nonlinear effects that may arise under
certain dynamical conditions, it is applicable to close-in gaseous extrasolar
planets like hot Jupiters, likely the first targets for which $k_2$ will be
measured.

active engagement. However, many times there is not sufficient evidence to
conclude that the intervention had the intended effect, and these null results

contribute significantly to physics education research, even if the results are
not statistically significant. First, we review social sciences and biomedical
research that has found widespread publication bias against null results,
exploring why it occurs and how it can hurt the field. We then present three
cases from physics education research to highlight how studies that yield null
results can contribute to our understanding of teaching and learning. Finally,
we distill from these studies some general principles for learning from null
results, proposing that we should evaluate them not on whether they reject the
null hypothesis, but according to their potential for generating new
understanding.

learning and signal processing because of its non-subtractive, part-based
property which enhances interpretability. It is often assumed that the latent
dimensionality (or the number of components) is given. Despite the large amount
of algorithms designed for NMF, there is little literature about automatic
model selection for NMF with theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose
an algorithm that first calculates an empirical second-order moment from the
empirical fourth-order cumulant tensor, and then estimates the latent
dimensionality by recovering the support union (the index set of non-zero rows)
of a matrix related to the empirical second-order moment. By assuming a
generative model of the data with additional mild conditions, our algorithm
provably detects the true latent dimensionality. We show on synthetic examples
that our proposed algorithm is able to find an approximately correct number of

they are microscopically reinforced with chemical species that form transient
crosslinks between the polymer chains. Besides the potential for self-healing,
recent experimental work suggests that freely diffusing reversible crosslinks
in polymer networks, such as gels, can enhance the toughness of the material
without substantial change in elasticity. This presents the opportunity for
making highly elastic materials that can be strained to a large extent before
rupturing. Here, we employ Gaussian chain theory, molecular simulation, and
polymer self-consistent field theory for networks to construct an equilibrium
picture for how reversible crosslinks can toughen a polymer network without
affecting its linear elasticity. Maximisation of polymer entropy drives the
reversible crosslinks to bind preferentially near the permanent crosslinks in
the network, leading to local molecular reinforcement without significant
alteration of the network topology. In equilibrium conditions, permanent
crosslinks share effectively the load with neighbouring reversible crosslinks,
forming multi-functional crosslink points. The network is thereby globally
toughened, while the linear elasticity is left largely unaltered. Practical
guidelines are proposed to optimise this design in experiment, along with a
discussion of key kinetic and timescale considerations.

observational strategies that are defined specifically to overcome the
challenges associated with mapping a small irregular body. We present these
strategies in the context of assessing candidate sample-sites at Bennu
according to a framework of decisions regarding the relative safety,
sampleability, and scientific value across the asteroid's surface. To create
data products that aid these assessments, we describe the best practices
developed by the OSIRIS-REx team for image-based mapping of irregular small
bodies. We emphasize the importance of using 3D shape models and the ability to
work in body-fixed rectangular coordinates when dealing with planetary surfaces
that cannot be uniquely addressed by body-fixed latitude and longitude.

even when the catalyst and its reactant are spatially separated across several
optical wavelengths. We demonstrate how photoexcitation of a `remote catalyst'
in an optical microcavity can control photochemistry of a reactant in another
microcavity. Harnessing delocalization across the spatially separated compounds
that arises from strong cavity-molecule coupling, this intriguing phenomenon is
shown for the infrared-induced \textit{cis} $\rightarrow$ \textit{trans}

trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs), 2016 QV$_{89}$ and 2016 QU$_{89}$, which have
orbits that appear similar to that of a previously known object, 2013
UH$_{15}$. All three ETNOs have semi-major axes $a\approx 172$ AU and
eccentricities $e\approx0.77$. The angular elements $(i,\omega,\Omega)$ vary by
6, 15, and 49 deg, respectively between the three objects. The two new objects
add to the small number of TNOs currently known to have semi-major axes between
150 and 250 AU, and serve as an interesting dynamical laboratory to study the
outer realm of our Solar System. Using a large ensemble of numerical
integrations, we find that the orbits are expected to reside in close proximity
in the $(a,e)$ phase plane for roughly 100 Myr before diffusing to more
separated values. We then explore other scenarios that could influence their
orbits. With aphelion distances over 300 AU, the orbits of these ETNOs extend
far beyond the classical Kuiper Belt, and an order of magnitude beyond Neptune.
As a result, their orbital dynamics can be affected by the proposed new Solar
System member, referred to as Planet Nine in this work. With perihelion
distances of 35-40 AU, these orbits are also influenced by resonant
interactions with Neptune. A full assessment of any possible, new Solar System
planets must thus take into account this emerging class of TNOs.

that these $\beta$ elements are detected in iterated algebraic K-theory of the

their magnetic ratio, the introduction of impurities quenches the order by
disorder selection mechanism associated with an Ising-like phase transition at
low temperatures and gives way to a $90^\circ$ (anticollinear) order . The
presence of dopants triggers a non trivial competition between entropically
selected states (collinear) and energetically favoured ones (anticollinear) in
dependence of both dilution and temperature. While in case of magnetic
impurity, the interesting magnetic phases are observed for full range of
temperature and doping, in case of nonmagnetic impurities every magnetic order
is destroyed at all temperatures above $12\%$ dilution. At fixed low
temperature and tuning the doping we show a first order phase transition
leading to the re-entrance of the Ising-like order with percolation of islands
of $90^\circ$ order. At fixed doping and varying the temperature we observe a
transition from the anticollinear to the collinear phase assisted by a new
emerging magnetic phase in the presence of magnetic impurities, whilst in case
of vacancies this transition is characterised by a coexistent region of both.
Furthermore, tuning the magnetic moment of the impurities, a complete collapse
of the Ising-like order is attained. This is in agreement with observations of
Ir dopant atoms in superconducting Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ir$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ with

defines the sample space of the source vertices of the sampled paths,
$\mathcal{D}(r)$ defines the sample space of the other vertices of the paths.

Moreover, it processes each sample faster and with less memory. Finally, we

large-scale applications involving huge state spaces and sparse delayed reward

this scalability issue by learning action selection policies at multiple levels
of temporal abstraction. Abstraction can be had by identifying a relatively
small set of states that are likely to be useful as subgoals, in concert with
the learning of corresponding skill policies to achieve those subgoals. Many
approaches to subgoal discovery in HRL depend on the analysis of a model of the
environment, but the need to learn such a model introduces its own problems of
scale. Once subgoals are identified, skills may be learned through intrinsic
motivation, introducing an internal reward signal marking subgoal attainment.
In this paper, we present a novel model-free method for subgoal discovery using
incremental unsupervised learning over a small memory of the most recent
experiences (trajectories) of the agent. When combined with an intrinsic
motivation learning mechanism, this method learns both subgoals and skills,
based on experiences in the environment. Thus, we offer an original approach to
HRL that does not require the acquisition of a model of the environment,
suitable for large-scale applications. We demonstrate the efficiency of our
method on two RL problems with sparse delayed feedback: a variant of the rooms

of the gap closing feature and establish that the degree of convexity (or
concavity) of the gap closing as a function of Zeeman field can provide
critical constraints on the underlying microscopic parameters of the
semiconductor-superconductor hybrid system model. Specifically, we show that
the gap closing feature is entirely concave only for strong spin-orbit coupling
strength relative to the chemical potential. Additionally, the non-linearity
(i.e. concavity or convexity) of the gap closing as a function of magnetic
field complicates the simple assignment of a constant effective $ g $-factor to
the states in the Majorana nanowire. We develop a procedure to estimate the
effective $ g $-factor from recent experimental data that accounts for the
non-linear gap closing resulting from the interplay between chemical potential
and spin-orbit coupling. Thus, measurements of the magnetic field dependence of
the gap closure on the trivial side of the topological quantum phase transition

theoretical modeling of Majorana nanowires.

travel times in the freeway network at five-minute intervals using Basic Safety
Messages (BSM); (2) develop an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model for
short-term travel time prediction on freeways. The XGB tree-based ensemble
prediction model is evaluated against common tree-based ensemble algorithms and
the evaluations are performed at five-minute intervals over a 30-minute
horizon. BSMs generated by the Safety Pilot Model Deployment conducted in Ann
Arbor, Michigan, were used. Nearly two billion messages were processed for
providing travel time estimates for the entire freeway network. A Combination
of grid search and five-fold cross-validation techniques using the travel time
estimates were used for developing the prediction models and tuning their
parameters. About 9.6 km freeway stretch was used for evaluating the XGB
together with the most common tree-based ensemble algorithms. The results show
that XGB is superior to all other algorithms, followed by the Gradient
Boosting. XGB travel time predictions were accurate and consistent with
variations during peak periods, with mean absolute percentage error in
prediction about 5.9% and 7.8% for 5-minute and 30-minute horizons,
respectively. Additionally, through applying the developed models to another
4.7 km stretch along the eastbound segment of M-14, the XGB demonstrated its
considerable advantages in travel time prediction during congested and
uncongested conditions.

the porous flow of melt through a viscously deforming solid rock matrix.
However, the system of equations describing this process becomes mathematically
degenerate in the limit of vanishing melt fraction. Numerical methods that do
not consider this degeneracy or avoid it solely by regularising specific
material properties generally become computationally expensive as soon as the
melt fraction approaches zero in some part of the domain.
  Here, we present a new formulation of the equations for coupled magma/mantle
dynamics that addresses this problem, and allows it to accurately compute
large-scale 3-D magma/mantle dynamics simulations with extensive regions of
zero melt fraction. We achieve this by rescaling one of the solution variables,
the compaction pressure, which ensures that for vanishing melt fraction, the
equation causing the degeneracy becomes an identity and the other two equations
revert to the Stokes system. This allows us to split the domain into two parts,
and to solve the coupled magma/mantle dynamics system only in cells where melt
is present.
  We have implemented this formulation in the open source geodynamic modelling
code ASPECT and illustrate the improved performance compared to the previous
three-field formulation, showing numerically that the new formulation is
optimal in terms of problem size and only minimally sensitive to model
parameters. Beyond that, we demonstrate the applicability to realistic problems
by showing large-scale 2-D and 3-D models of mid-ocean ridges with complex
rheology. Hence, we believe that our new formulation and its implementation in
ASPECT will prove a valuable tool for studying the interaction of melt
segregating through and interacting with a solid host rock in the Earth and
other planetary bodies using high-resolution, three-dimensional simulations.

important problem in domains as diverse as medicine, astronomy, finance, and

because of the complex nature of noise in the trajectories (e.g. different
sampling rates or outliers). Domain experts typically hand-craft or manually
select a specific metric, such as dynamic time warping (DTW), to apply on their
data. In this paper, we propose Autowarp, an end-to-end algorithm that
optimizes and learns a good metric given unlabeled trajectories. We define a
flexible and differentiable family of warping metrics, which encompasses common
metrics such as DTW, Euclidean, and edit distance. Autowarp then leverages the
representation power of sequence autoencoders to optimize for a member of this
warping distance family. The output is a metric which is easy to interpret and
can be robustly learned from relatively few trajectories. In systematic
experiments across different domains, we show that Autowarp often outperforms
hand-crafted trajectory similarity metrics.

distinguishes a generated image from a real image, in AmbientGAN model the
discriminator has to separate a real measurement from a simulated measurement

approaches; the proposed reconstruction uses a variety of training data sets to
generate a low dimensional manifold of approximate solutions, which allows to
convert the ill-posed problem to a well-posed one. Variational autoencoder was
used to produce a compact and dense representation for lung EIT images with a
low dimensional latent space. Then, we learn a robust connection between the
EIT data and the low-dimensional latent data. Numerical simulations validate

Theory. This consists of $N$-point models on a manifold $M$, for which some
geometrical automorphism group $G$ is regarded as meaningless and is thus
quotiented out from the $N$-point model's product space $\times_{I = 1}^N M$.
Each such model has an associated function space of preserved quantities,
solving the PDE system for zero brackets with the sums over $N$ of each of
$G$'s generators. These are smooth functions of the $N$-point geometrical
invariants. Each $(M, G)$ pair has moreover a `minimal nontrivially relational
unit' value of $N$; we now show that relationally-invariant derivatives can be
defined on these, yielding the titular notions of shape(-and-scale)
derivatives. We obtain each by Taylor-expanding a functional version of the
underlying geometrical invariant, and isolating a shape-independent derivative
factor in the nontrivial leading-order term. We do this for translational,
dilational, dilatational and projective geometries in 1-$d$, the last of which
gives a shape-theoretic rederivation of the Schwarzian derivative. We next
phrase and solve the ODEs for zero and constant values of each derivative. We
then consider translational, dilational, rotational, rotational-and-dilational,
Euclidean and equi-top-form (alias unimodular affine) cases in $\geq 2$-$d$. We
finally pose the PDEs for zero and constant values of each of our $\geq 2$-$d$
derivatives, and solve a subset of these geometrically-motivated PDEs. This
work is significant for Relational Motion and Background Independence in
Theoretical Physics, and foundational for both Flat and Differential Geometry.

only if other victims of the same perpetrator also step forward. Common
examples include 1) identifying oneself as the victim of sexual harassment,
especially by a person in a position of authority or 2) accusing an influential
politician, an authoritarian government, or ones own employer of corruption. To
handle such situations, legal literature has proposed the concept of an
allegation escrow: a neutral third-party that collects allegations anonymously,
matches them against each other, and de-anonymizes allegers only after
de-anonymity thresholds (in terms of number of co-allegers), pre-specified by
the allegers, are reached.
  An allegation escrow can be realized as a single trusted third party;
however, this party must be trusted to keep the identity of the alleger and
content of the allegation private. To address this problem, this paper
introduces Secure Allegation Escrows (SAE, pronounced ""say""). A SAE is a group
of parties with independent interests and motives, acting jointly as an escrow
for collecting allegations from individuals, matching the allegations, and
de-anonymizing the allegations when designated thresholds are reached. By
design, SAEs provide a very strong property: No less than a majority of parties
constituting a SAE can de-anonymize or disclose the content of an allegation
without a sufficient number of matching allegations (even in collusion with any
number of other allegers). Once a sufficient number of matching allegations
exist, the join escrow discloses the allegation with the allegers' identities.
We describe how SAEs can be constructed using a novel authentication protocol
and a novel allegation matching and bucketing algorithm, provide formal proofs
of the security of our constructions, and evaluate a prototype implementation,
demonstrating feasibility in practice.

find a progression with redshift in observed galaxy SEDs, from those resembling

occurs when the power demand exceeds the maximum power that can be transferred
through the network. The traditional (preventive) approach to avoid voltage
collapse is based on ensuring that the network never reaches its maximum
capacity. However, such an approach leads to inefficiencies as it prevents
operators to fully utilize the network resources and does not account for
unprescribed events. To overcome this limitation, this paper seeks to initiate
the study of voltage collapse stabilization.
  More precisely, for a DC network, we formulate the problem of voltage
stability as a dynamic problem where each load seeks to achieve a constant
power consumption by updating its conductance as the voltage changes. We show
that such a system can be interpreted as a dynamic game, where each player
(load) seeks to myopically maximize their utility, and where every stable power
flow solution amounts to a Local Nash Equilibrium.
  Using this framework, we show that voltage collapse is equivalent to the
non-existence of a Local Nash Equilibrium in the game and, as a result, it is
caused by the lack of cooperation between loads. Finally, we propose a Voltage
Collapse Stabilizer (VCS) controller that uses (flexible) loads that are
willing to cooperate and provides a fair allocation of the curtailed demand.
Our solution stabilizes voltage collapse even in the presence of
non-cooperative loads. Numerical simulations validate several features of our
controllers.

become significantly important in many fields including health, finance,
social, etc. Although linear Poisson regression has been widely used to model
count and rate data, it might not be always suitable as it cannot capture some
inherent variability within complex data. In this study, we introduce a
probabilistically driven nonlinear Poisson regression model with Bayesian
artificial neural networks (ANN) to model count or rate data. This new
nonlinear Poisson regression model developed with Bayesian ANN provides higher
prediction accuracies over traditional Poisson or negative binomial regression
models as revealed in our simulation and real data studies.

all performed in a decentralized but trusted manner, we propose to use the
blockchain with the mining pool to support IoT services based on cognitive
radio networks. As such, the secondary user can send its sensing data, i.e.,
transactions, to the mining pools. After being verified by miners, the
transactions are added to the blocks. However, under the dynamics of the
primary channel and the uncertainty of the mempool state of the mining pool, it
is challenging for the secondary user to determine an optimal transaction
transmission policy. In this paper, we propose to use the deep reinforcement
learning algorithm to derive an optimal transaction transmission policy for the
secondary user. Specifically, we adopt a Double Deep-Q Network (DDQN) that
allows the secondary user to learn the optimal policy. The simulation results
clearly show that the proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm
outperforms the conventional Q-learning scheme in terms of reward and learning
speed.

form through merging processes within the highest density peaks known as
protoclusters. While high-redshift radio galaxies usually pinpoint the location
of these environments, we have recently discovered at z~2-3 three Enormous
(>200 kpc) Lyman-Alpha Nebulae (ELANe) that host multiple AGN and that are
surrounded by overdensities of Lyman-alpha Emitters (LAE). These regions are
prime candidates of massive protoclusters in the early stages of assembly. To
characterize the star-forming activity within these rare structures - both on
ELAN and protocluster scales - we have initiated an observational campaign with
the JCMT and the APEX telescopes. In this paper we report on sensitive
SCUBA-2/JCMT 850 and 450 $\mu$m observations of a 128 arcmin$^2$ field
comprising the ELAN MAMMOTH-1, together with the peak of the hosting BOSS1441
LAE overdensity at z=2.32. These observations unveil $4.0\pm1.3$ times higher
source counts at 850 $\mu$m with respect to blank fields, likely confirming the
presence of an overdensity also in obscured tracers. We find a strong detection
at 850 $\mu$m associated with the continuum source embedded within the ELAN
MAMMOTH-1, which - together with the available data from the literature - allow
us to constrain the spectral energy distribution of this source to be of an
ULIRG with a far-infrared luminosity of $L_{\rm FIR}^{\rm
SF}=2.4^{+7.4}_{-2.1}\times10^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$, and hosting an obscured AGN.
Such a source is thus able to power the hard photoionization plus outflow
scenario depicted in Cai et al. (2017b) to explain the extended Lyman-alpha,
HeII$\lambda1640$ and CIV$\lambda1549$ emission, and their kinematics. In
addition, the two brightest detections at 850 $\mu$m ($f_{850}>18$ mJy) sit at
the density peak of the LAEs overdensity, likely pinpointing the core of the
protocluster.

  Periodically Arranged Solid Obstacles","Version 3 includes new information that shows that the conservation
  of momentum is satisfied during symmetry-breaking",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Microscale turbulence in porous media is a new physical phenomenon that
exhibits unique properties unlike those in classical turbulence flows. At low
values of porosity, the surface forces on the solid obstacles compete with the
inertial force of the fluid flow to result in the formation of flow
instabilities. In this paper, we report the origin and mechanism of a
symmetry-breaking phenomenon in periodic porous media that causes a deviation
in the direction of the mean flow from that of the applied pressure gradient.
Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to simulate turbulent flow in a homogeneous
porous medium consisting of a periodic, square lattice arrangement of
cylindrical solid obstacles. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is used to
simulate the transient stages during symmetry breakdown and also to validate
the LES method. Quantitative and qualitative observations are made from the
following approaches: (1) macroscale momentum budget, (2) 2D & 3D flow
visualization. The phenomenon draws its roots from the amplification of a flow
instability that emerges from the vortex shedding process. The
symmetry-breaking phenomenon is a pitchfork bifurcation that can exhibit
multiple modes depending on the local vortex shedding process. The phenomenon
is observed to be sensitive to the porosity, solid obstacle shape, and the
Reynolds number. It is a source of macroscale turbulence anisotropy in porous
media for symmetric solid obstacle geometries. The resulting macroscale flow
field is oriented such that it does not align with the plane of symmetry of the
porous matrix geometry. The principal axis of the Reynolds stress tensor is not
aligned with any of the geometric axes of symmetry, nor with the direction of
flow. Thus, symmetry-breaking in porous media involves new flow physics that
should be taken into consideration while modeling flow inhomogeneity in the
macroscale.

seizures, one of the most common brain diseases worldwide. A better
understanding of neural synchronisation mechanisms can thus help control or
even treat epilepsy. In this paper, we study neural synchronisation in a random
network where nodes are neurons with excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and
neural activity for each node is provided by the adaptive exponential
integrate-and-fire model. In this framework, we verify that the decrease in the
influence of inhibition can generate synchronisation originating from a pattern
of desynchronised spikes. The transition from desynchronous spikes to
synchronous bursts of activity, induced by varying the synaptic coupling,
emerges in a hysteresis loop due to bistability where abnormal (excessively
high synchronous) regimes exist. We verify that, for parameters in the
bistability regime, a square current pulse can trigger excessively high
(abnormal) synchronisation, a process that can reproduce features of epileptic
seizures. Then, we show that it is possible to suppress such abnormal
synchronisation by applying a small-amplitude external current on less than 10%
of the neurons in the network. Our results demonstrate that external electrical
stimulation not only can trigger synchronous behaviour, but more importantly,
it can be used as a means to reduce abnormal synchronisation and thus, control
or treat effectively epileptic seizures.

design collections and across time to identify fashion change and directions;
designers, product developers and buyers abstract across a group of garments
and collections to develop a cohesive and visually appeal lines; sales and
marketing executives abstract across product line each season to recognize
selling points; fashion journalist and bloggers abstract across runway photos
to recognize symbolic core concepts that can be translated into editorial
features. Fashion attributes analysis for such fashion insiders requires much
detailed and in-depth attributes annotation than that for consumers, and
requires inference on multiple domains. In this project, we propose a
data-driven approach for recognizing fashion attributes. Specifically, a
modified version of Faster R-CNN model is trained on images from a large-scale
localization dataset with 594 fine-grained attributes under different
scenarios, for example in online stores and street snapshots. This model will
then be used to detect garment items and classify clothing attributes for
runway photos and fashion illustrations.

  Backward Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For an $\cF_T$-measurable payoff of a European type contingent claim, the
recursive utility process/dynamic risk measure can be described by the adapted
solution to a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). However, for an
$\cF_T$-measurable stochastic process (called a position process, not
necessarily $\dbF$-adapted), mimicking BSDE's approach will lead to a
time-inconsistent recursive utility/dynamic risk measure. It is found that a
more proper approach is to use the adapted solution to a backward stochastic
Volterra integral equation (BSVIE). The corresponding notions are called
equilibrium recursive utility and equilibrium dynamic risk measure,
respectively. Motivated by this, the current paper is concerned with BSVIEs
whose generators are allowed to have quadratic growth (in $Z(t,s)$). The
existence and uniqueness for both the so-called adapted solutions and adapted
M-solutions are established. A comparison theorem for adapted solutions to the
so-called Type-I BSVIEs is established as well. As consequences of these
results, some general continuous-time equilibrium dynamic risk measures and
equilibrium recursive utility processes are constructed.

  segmentation in whole mammograms",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mammography is one of the most commonly applied tools for early breast cancer
screening. Automatic segmentation of breast masses in mammograms is essential
but challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the wide variety of
mass shapes and sizes. Existing methods deal with these challenges mainly by
extracting mass-centered image patches manually or automatically. However,
manual patch extraction is time-consuming and automatic patch extraction brings
errors that could not be compensated in the following segmentation step. In
this study, we propose a novel attention-guided dense-upsampling network
(AUNet) for accurate breast mass segmentation in whole mammograms directly. In
AUNet, we employ an asymmetrical encoder-decoder structure and propose an
effective upsampling block, attention-guided dense-upsampling block (AU block).
Especially, the AU block is designed to have three merits. Firstly, it
compensates the information loss of bilinear upsampling by dense upsampling.
Secondly, it designs a more effective method to fuse high- and low-level
features. Thirdly, it includes a channel-attention function to highlight
rich-information channels. We evaluated the proposed method on two publicly
available datasets, CBIS-DDSM and INbreast. Compared to three state-of-the-art
fully convolutional networks, AUNet achieved the best performances with an
average Dice similarity coefficient of 81.8% for CBIS-DDSM and 79.1% for
INbreast.

4Jy at 154 MHz) unresolved, extragalactic radio sources monitored monthly for
several years with the Murchison Widefield Array. In the majority of sources we
find very low levels of variability with typical modulation indices < 5%. We
detect 15 candidate low frequency variables that show significant long term
variability (>2.8 years) with time-averaged modulation indices M = 3.1 - 7.1%.
With 7/15 of these variable sources having peaked spectral energy
distributions, and only 5.7% of the overall sample having peaked spectra, we
find an increase in the prevalence of variability in this spectral class. We
conclude that the variability seen in this survey is most probably a
consequence of refractive interstellar scintillation and that these objects
must have the majority of their flux density contained within angular diameters
less than 50 milli-arcsec (which we support with multi-wavelength data). At 154
MHz we demonstrate that interstellar scintillation time-scales become long
(~decades) and have low modulation indices, whilst synchrotron driven
variability can only produce dynamic changes on time-scales of hundreds of
years, with flux density changes less than one milli-jansky (without
relativistic boosting). From this work we infer that the low frequency
extra-galactic southern sky, as seen by SKA-Low, will be non-variable on
time-scales shorter than one year.

in the process of analyzing the data, we found a small-scale flare in the

the He I 10830 {\AA} line, we identified this flare as a negative flare. The
aim of this paper is to study the influence of the negative flare on the
oscillation characteristics in the facular photosphere and chromosphere. We
measured line-of-sight (LOS) velocity and intensity of all the three lines as
well as half-width of the chromospheric lines. We also used SDO/HMI magnetic
field data. The flare caused modulation of all the studied parameters. In the
location of the negative flare, the amplitude of the oscillations increased
four times on average. In the adjacent magnetic field local maxima, the
chromospheric LOS velocity oscillations appreciably decreased during the flare.
The facula region oscillated as a whole with a 5-minute period before the
flare, and this synchronicity was disrupted after the flare. The flare changed
the spectral composition of the line-of-sight magnetic field oscillations,
causing an increase in the low-frequency oscillation power.

work, we propose Randomized Gradient Boosting Machine (RGBM) which leads to
substantial computational gains compared to GBM, by using a randomization

towards better step-size selection in RGBM that does not require a line search.
Our proposed framework is inspired by a special variant of coordinate descent
that combines the benefits of randomized coordinate descent and greedy
coordinate descent; and may be of independent interest as an optimization
algorithm. As a special case, our results for RGBM lead to superior
computational guarantees for GBM. Our computational guarantees depend upon a
curious geometric quantity that we call Minimal Cosine Angle, which relates to
the density of weak-learners in the prediction space. On a series of numerical
experiments on real datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RGBM over GBM
in terms of obtaining a model with good training and/or testing data fidelity

the considerable computing cost of LSTM, we put forward the Random Connectivity
LSTM (RCLSTM) model and test it by predicting traffic and user mobility in
telecommunication networks. Compared to LSTM, RCLSTM is formed via stochastic
connectivity between neurons, which achieves a significant breakthrough in the
architecture formation of neural networks. In this way, the RCLSTM model
exhibits a certain level of sparsity, which leads to an appealing decrease in
the computational complexity and makes the RCLSTM model become more applicable
in latency-stringent application scenarios. In the field of telecommunication
networks, the prediction of traffic series and mobility traces could directly
benefit from this improvement as we further demonstrate that the prediction

(SFR). Since molecular gas is essential for star formation, it is vital to
establish whether, and by how much, galaxy interactions affect the molecular
gas properties. We investigate the effect of interactions on global molecular
gas properties by studying a sample of 58 galaxies in pairs and 154 control
galaxies. Molecular gas properties are determined from observations with the
JCMT, PMO, CSO telescopes, and supplemented with data from the xCOLD GASS and
JINGLE surveys at $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(2-1). The SFR, gas mass
($M_\mathrm{H_{2}}$), and gas fraction ($f_{gas}$) are all enhanced in galaxies
in pairs by $\sim$ 2.5 times compared to the controls matched in redshift,
mass, and effective radius, while the enhancement of star formation efficiency
(SFE $\equiv$ SFR/$M_{H_{2}}$) is less than a factor of 2. We also find that
the enhancements in SFR, $M_{H_{2}}$ and $f_{gas}$ increase with decreasing
pair separation and are larger in systems with smaller stellar mass ratio.
Conversely, the SFE is only enhanced in close pairs (separation $<$ 20 kpc) and
equal-mass systems; therefore most galaxies in pairs lie in the same parameter
space on the SFR-$M_{H_{2}}$ plane as controls. This is the first time that the
dependence of molecular gas properties on merger configurations is probed
statistically with a relatively large sample and with a carefully-selected
control sample for individual galaxies. We conclude that galaxy interactions do
modify the molecular gas properties, although the strength of the effect is
merger configuration dependent.

calculated by the combination of screened hybrid functional of HSE and DFT-PBE

fully exploits all the information available in a data set without any binning,
correctly accounts for both measurement error and sample incompleteness,
naturally handles heterogenous data (for example fields that have been imaged
with different sets of filters or to different depths), marginalises over
uncertain extinctions, and returns the full posterior distributions of the
parameters describing star cluster demographics. We demonstrate the method
using mock star cluster catalogs and show that our method is robust and
accurate, and that it can recover the demographics of star cluster populations
significantly better than traditional fitting methods. For realistic sample
sizes, our method is sufficiently powerful that its accuracy is ultimately
limited by the accuracy of the underlying physical models for stellar evolution
and interstellar dust, rather than by statistical uncertainties. Our method is
implemented as part of the Stochastically Lighting Up Galaxies (SLUG) stellar

difficult to train and have yet to demonstrate wall-clock speedups over

learned optimizers are trained by truncated backpropagation through an unrolled

(for short truncations) or have exploding norm (for long truncations). In this
work we propose a training scheme which overcomes both of these difficulties,
by dynamically weighting two unbiased gradient estimators for a variational
loss on optimizer performance, allowing us to train neural networks to perform
optimization of a specific task faster than tuned first-order methods. We
demonstrate these results on problems where our learned optimizer trains
convolutional networks faster in wall-clock time compared to tuned first-order

stronger for closer encounters and more massive perturbers. For the very same

this kind of features both in the gas and in the dust for grains ranging from 1

autonomous vehicles is validating the performance of each algorithm under a
comprehensive variety of operating conditions. In the case of vision-based
semantic segmentation, there are known issues when encountering new scenarios
that are sufficiently different to the training data. In addition, even small
variations in environmental conditions such as illumination and precipitation
can affect the classification performance of the segmentation model. Given the
reliance on visual information, these effects often translate into poor
semantic pixel classification which can potentially lead to catastrophic
consequences when driving autonomously. This paper presents a novel method for
analysing the robustness of semantic segmentation models and provides a number
of metrics to evaluate the classification performance over a variety of
environmental conditions. The process incorporates an additional sensor (lidar)
to automate the process, eliminating the need for labour-intensive hand
labelling of validation data. The system integrity can be monitored as the
performance of the vision sensors are validated against a different sensor
modality. This is necessary for detecting failures that are inherent to vision
technology. Experimental results are presented based on multiple datasets
collected at different times of the year with different environmental
conditions. These results show that the semantic segmentation performance
varies depending on the weather, camera parameters, existence of shadows, etc..
The results also demonstrate how the metrics can be used to compare and
validate the performance after making improvements to a model, and compare the
performance of different networks.

motional heating, as well as the noise before and after ion bombardment
cleaning of trap electrodes, suggest that fluctuations of adsorbate dipoles are
a likely source of so-called `anomalous heating,' or motional heating of the
trapped ions at a rate much higher than the Johnson noise limit. Previous
computational studies have investigated how the fluctuation of model adsorbate
dipoles affects anomalous heating. However, the way in which specific
adsorbates affect the electric field noise has not yet been examined, and an
electric dipole model employed in previous studies is only accurate for a small
subset of possible adsorbates. Here, we analyze the behavior of both in-plane

within the independent fluctuating dipole model, utilizing accurate first
principles computational methods to determine the surface-induced dipole
moments. We find the chemical specificity of the adsorbate can change the
electric field noise by seven orders of magnitude and specifically that soft
in-plane modes of weakly-adsorbed hydrocarbons produce the greatest noise and
ion heating. We discuss the dynamics captured by the fluctuating dipole model,

exhibited enormous enhancement of optical nonlinearity. Such nanostructures
have been actively studied by researchers in the last years. The present work
provides the first numerical analysis study of the optical Kerr effect of
nanocomposites consisting of high refractive index (GaP) spheres at the
wavelength of 532~nm. This is done by means of three-dimensional
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. The effective nonlinear
refractive index of $0.8$~$\mu$m thick nanocomposites and metasurfaces is
evaluated. It is shown that the optical Kerr nonlinearity of the nanocomposites
rises by orders in proximity to Mie resonances and may exceed the second-order
refractive index of the bulk material. It is revealed that the sign of the
effective optical Kerr coefficient is inverted near the Mie resonances. This
effect may be of interest in developing nonlinear optical metadevices.

a spatial unit by an animal. It is natural to think of it as the long-term
consequence of the animal's short-term movement decisions: it is the
accumulation of small displacements which, over time, gives rise to global
patterns of space use. However, most utilisation distribution models either
ignore the underlying movement, assuming the independenceof observed locations,
or are based on simplistic Brownian motion movement rules. 2. We introduce a
new continuous-time model of animal movement, based on the Langevin diffusion.
This stochastic process has an explicit stationary distribution, conceptually
analogous to the idea of the utilisation distribution, and thus provides an
intuitive framework to integrate movement and space use. We model the
stationary (utilisation) distribution with a resource selection function to
link the movement to spatial covariates, and allow inference into habitat
selection. 3. Standard approximation techniques can be used to derive the
pseudo-likelihood of the Langevin diffusion movement model, and to estimate
habitat preference and movement parameters from tracking data. We investigate
the performance of the method on simulated data, and discuss its sensitivity to
the time scale of the sampling. We present an example of its application to
tracking data of Stellar sea lions (Eumetopiasjubatus). 4. Due to its
continuous-time formulation, this method can be applied to irregular telemetry
data. It provides a rigorous framework to estimate long-term habitat selection
from correlated movement data.

re-identification (ReID) datasets and real-world scenes, it is thus crucial for
a person ReID model to handle the image resolution variations for improving its
generalization ability. However, most existing person ReID methods pay little
attention to this resolution discrepancy problem. One paradigm to deal with
this problem is to use some complicated methods for mapping all images into an
artificial image space, which however will disrupt the natural image
distribution and requires heavy image preprocessing. In this paper, we analyze
the deficiencies of several widely-used objective functions handling image
resolution discrepancies and propose a new framework called deep antithetical
learning that directly learns from the natural image space rather than creating
an arbitrary one. We first quantify and categorize original training images
according to their resolutions. Then we create an antithetical training set and
make sure that original training images have counterparts with antithetical
resolutions in this new set. At last, a novel Contrastive Center Loss(CCL) is
proposed to learn from images with different resolutions without being
interfered by their resolution discrepancies. Extensive experimental analyses
and evaluations indicate that the proposed framework, even using a vanilla deep
ReID network, exhibits remarkable performance improvements. Without bells and

computes, in $\tilde{\cal O}(n^{5/3}+m)$-time, a cycle of weight at most twice

Finally, if we insist in removing the dependency in the number $m$ of edges, we
can transform our algorithms into an $\tilde{\cal O}(n^{5/3})$-time randomized
$4$-approximation for the graphs with non negative edge-weights -- assuming the
adjacency lists are sorted. Combined with the aforementioned Hitting Set based

there is a point $c$, not necessarily from $P$, such that each halfspace
containing $c$ contains at least $\frac{n}{d+1}$ points of $P$. Such a point
$c$ is called a centerpoint, and it can be viewed as a generalization of a
median to higher dimensions. In other words, a centerpoint can be interpreted
as a good representative for the point set $P$. But what if we allow more than
one representative? For example in one-dimensional data sets, often certain
quantiles are chosen as representatives instead of the median. We present a
possible extension of the concept of quantiles to higher dimensions. The idea
is to find a set $Q$ of (few) points such that every halfspace that contains
one point of $Q$ contains a large fraction of the points of $P$ and every
halfspace that contains more of $Q$ contains an even larger fraction of $P$.

established yet. Important hints can be provided by the spectral slope, and its
relation to other emission properties. We compiled the highest resolution 5 and
8.4 GHz VLA observations available of the RQ optically selected PG quasars at
z<0.5. We derive the 5-8.4 GHz spectral slope, alpha_R, for 25 of the complete
and well studied sample of 71 RQ PG quasars. We find a highly significant
correlation of alpha_R with L/L_Edd, where high L/L_Edd (>0.3) quasars have a
steep slope (alpha_R<-0.5), indicative of an optically thin synchrotron source.
In contrast, lower L/L_Edd (<0.3) quasars generally have a flat slope
(alpha_R>-0.5), indicative of a compact optically thick synchrotron source.
Flat alpha_R quasars also have a low Fe II/Hbeta line ratio, and a flat soft
X-ray slope. The 16 Radio Loud (RL) PGs do not follow the RQ quasar set of
correlations, and their alpha_R is set by M_BH, suggesting that the radio
emission mechanisms in RL and RQ quasars are different. A possible
interpretation is that high L/L_Edd RQ quasars produce a strong outflow and an
associated optically thin synchrotron emission. In lower L/L_Edd RQ quasars,
the strong outflow is missing, and only a compact optically thick radio source
remains, possibly associated with the accretion disk coronal emission. A
systematic study of RQ quasars at higher frequencies, and higher resolution,
can test whether a compact flat source indeed resides in the cores of all RQ
quasars, and allow the exploration of its relation with the coronal X-ray
emission.

downstream search and mining applications. Achieving high disambiguation
accuracy crucially depends on a rich and holistic representation of the
entities in the KB. For popular entities, such a representation can be easily
mined from Wikipedia, and many current entity disambiguation and linking
methods make use of this fact. However, Wikipedia does not contain long-tail
entities that only few people are interested in, and also at times lags behind
until newly emerging entities are added. For such entities, mining a suitable
representation in a fully automated fashion is very difficult, resulting in
poor linking accuracy.
  What can automatically be mined, though, is a high-quality representation
given the context of a new entity occurring in any text. Due to the lack of
knowledge about the entity, no method can retrieve these occurrences
automatically with high precision, resulting in a chicken-egg problem. To
address this, our approach automatically generates candidate occurrences of
entities, prompting the user for feedback to decide if the occurrence refers to

exact solutions represented in a compact closed form which is appropriate for
further analysis and straightforward computations with polynomial time

Clifford gates - the Hadamard, $\pi/4$-phase and controlled-X gates. Because of
this restriction the Clifford model of quantum computation can be efficiently

the complexity of the design. Another way of improving the performance is to
tailor the optical properties of materials specifically to the application at

van Erp, Christian Voigt and Marco Matassa, compiled for the ""Habilitation \`a

  We present various different approaches to constructing algebras of
pseudodifferential operators adapted to filtered and multifiltered manifolds
and some quantum analogues. A general goal is the study of index problems in
situations where standard elliptic theory is insufficient. We also present some
applications of these constructions.
  We begin by presenting a characterization of pseudodifferential operators on
filtered manifolds in terms of distributions on the tangent groupoid which are
essentially homogeneous with respect to the natural
$\mathbb{R}^\times_+$-action. Next, we describe a rudimentary multifiltered
pseudodifferential theory on the full flag manifold $\mathcal{X}$ of a complex
semisimple Lie group $G$ which allows us to simultaneously treat longitudinal
pseudodifferential operators along every one of the canonical fibrations of
$\mathcal{X}$ over smaller flag manifolds. The motivating application is the
construction of a $G$-equivariant $K$-homology class from the
Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand complex of a semisimple group.
  Finally, we discuss pseudodifferential operators on two classes of quantum
flag manifolds: quantum projective spaces and the full flag manifolds of
$SU_q(n)$. In particular, on the full flag variety of $SU_q(3)$ we obtain an
equivariant fundamental class from the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand complex.

computationally efficient solution based on the shifted Lambert W-function also
known as the Wright Omega-function. The Wright Omega-function is more suitable
because it overcomes the problem with the overflow error by switching the fast
growing term y=W(e^x) of the Lambert W-function to the series expansions that
further can be easily evaluated in computers without causing overflow run-time
errors. Although the Colebrook equation transformed through the Lambert
W-function is identical to the original expression in term of accuracy, a
further evaluation of the Lambert W-function can be only approximate. Very
accurate explicit approximations of the Colebrook equation that contains only
one or two logarithms are shown. The final result is an accurate explicit
approximation of the Colebrook equation with the relative error of no more than
0.0096%. The presented approximations are in the form suitable for everyday

performance computing (HPC) applications providing on-demand resources as well
as scalability. They usually offer different classes of Virtual Machines (VMs)
which ensure different guarantees in terms of availability and volatility,
provisioning the same resource through multiple pricing models. For instance,
in Amazon EC2 cloud, the user pays per hour for on-demand VMs while spot VMs
are unused instances available for lower price. Despite the monetary
advantages, a spot VM can be terminated, stopped, or hibernated by EC2 at any
moment.
  Using both hibernation-prone spot VMs (for cost sake) and on-demand VMs, we
propose in this paper a static scheduling for HPC applications which are
composed by independent tasks (bag-of-task) with deadline constraints. However,
if a spot VM hibernates and it does not resume within a time which guarantees
the application's deadline, a temporal failure takes place. Our scheduling,
thus, aims at minimizing monetary costs of bag-of-tasks applications in EC2
cloud, respecting its deadline and avoiding temporal failures. To this end, our
algorithm statically creates two scheduling maps: (i) the first one contains,
for each task, its starting time and on which VM (i.e., an available spot or
on-demand VM with the current lowest price) the task should execute; (ii) the
second one contains, for each task allocated on a VM spot in the first map, its
starting time and on which on-demand VM it should be executed to meet the
application deadline in order to avoid temporal failures. The latter will be
used whenever the hibernation period of a spot VM exceeds a time limit.
  Performance results from simulation with task execution traces, configuration
of Amazon EC2 VM classes, and VMs market history confirms the effectiveness of
our scheduling and that it tolerates temporal failures.

control over the surface charge of the substrate through modification of the
surface functionality, allowing for the optimisation of electrostatic diamond
seeding densities. Zeta potential measurements and X-ray photoelectron

each treatment. Exposing silicon nitride to an oxygen plasma offered optimal
surface conditions for the electrostatic self-assembly of a hydrogen-terminated

candidate in the center of nearby barred bulgeless galaxy $\rm NGC~3319$. The
point X-ray source revealed by archival Chandra and XMM-Newton observations is
spatially coincident with the optical and UV galactic nuclei from Hubble Space
Telescope observations. The spectral energy distribution derived from the
unresolved X-ray and UV-optical flux is comparable with active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) rather than ultra-luminous X-ray sources, although its bolometric
luminosity is only $3.6\times10^{40}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$. Assuming an Eddington
ratio range between 0.001 and 1, the black hole mass ($M_\rm{BH}$) will be
located at $3\times10^2-3\times10^5~M_{\odot}$, placing it in the so-called
IMBH regime and could be the one of the lowest reported so far. Estimates from
other approaches (e.g., fundamental plane, X-ray variability) also suggest
$M_\rm{BH}\lesssim10^5~M_{\odot}$.Similar to other BHs in bulgeless galaxies,
the discovered IMBH resides in a nuclear star cluster with mass of
$\sim6\times10^6~M_{\odot}$. The detection of such a low-mass BH offers us an
ideal chance to study the formation and early growth of SMBH seeds, which may
result from the bar-driven inflow in late-type galaxies with a prominent bar
such as $\rm NGC~3319$.

observed brightnesses and temperatures, thereby affecting the stellar locus on
the H-R diagram. Recent high precision space-based photometric surveys reveal
the rotational modulation from spots on stars in young clusters, including K2
monitoring of the 125-Myr-old Pleiades cluster. However, lightcurves reveal
only the asymmetries in the visible spot distributions rather than the total
sizes of spots on stellar surfaces, which causes a discrepancy between the spot
coverage measured by photometric and spectroscopic observations. In this paper,
we simulate photometric variability introduced by randomly-distributed
starspots on a 125-Myr-old coeval cluster. Our simulation results show that
randomly distributed small spots on the stellar surface would explain this
discrepancy that the photometric observations only reveal 10% to 40% of the
spot coverage measured by spectra. The colors and luminosities of photospheres
are modeled for a range of photospheric temperature, spot coverage, and spot
temperature. The colors and luminosities of a simulated population are then
compared to the luminosity spread of Pleiades members, excluding the 25% of
candidates that are identified as non-members with Gaia DR2 astrometry. The
observed luminosities of Pleiades members have a standard deviation of 0.05
dex, which could be entirely explained by spots with a star-to-star standard
deviation of spot coverage of 10%, but with an average coverage area that is
not well constrained.

numerous capture occasions over a relatively short period of time. For many
study species this process is repeated, for example annually, resulting in
capture information spanning multiple sampling periods. The robust design class
of models provide a convenient framework in which to analyse all of the
available capture data in a single likelihood expression. However, these models
typically rely either upon the assumption of closure within a sampling period
(the closed robust design) or condition on the number of individuals captured
within a sampling period (the open robust design). The models we develop in
this paper require neither assumption by explicitly modelling the movement of
individuals into the population both within and between the sampling periods,
which in turn permits the estimation of abundance. These models are further
extended to allow parameters to depend not only on capture occasion but also
the amount of time since joining the population and to the case of multi-state
data where there is individual time-varying discrete covariate information. We
derive an efficient likelihood expression for the new multi-state multi-period
stopover model using the hidden Markov model framework. We demonstrate the new
model through a simulation study before considering a dataset on great crested

system's particular wave function symmetry decouples its optical properties

a high-fidelity spin-to-photon interface with exceptionally stable and narrow

electron spin coherence times comparable with nitrogen-vacancy centres in

connection is that neighbor-avoiding walks are equivalent to the infinitely
repulsive limit of self-avoiding walks with monomer-monomer interactions. Such
repulsive interactions can be seen to enhance the excluded volume effect. We
calculate the critical behavior of the adsorption transition for
neighbor-avoiding walks, finding a critical temperature $T_{\text a}=3.274(9)$
and a crossover exponent $\phi=0.482(13)$, which is consistent with the
exponent for self-avoiding walks and trails, leading to an overall combined
estimate for three dimensions of $\phi_\text{3D}=0.484(7)$. While questions of
universality have previously been raised regarding the value of adsorption
exponents in three dimensions, our results indicate that the value of $\phi$ in
the strongly repulsive regime does not differ from its non-interacting value.
However, it is clearly different from the mean-field value of $1/2$ and
therefore not super-universal.

into detail how to implement arbitrary order (i.e., $p$-adaptive) elements on
hexahedral and tetrahedral meshes. First, we set the three classical
ingredients of the finite element definition by Ciarlet, both in the reference

these ingredients, shape functions are automatically implemented by defining a
judiciously chosen polynomial pre-basis that spans the local finite element
space combined with a change of basis to automatically obtain a canonical basis
with respect to the moments at hand. Next, we discuss global finite element
spaces putting emphasis on the construction of global shape functions through
oriented meshes, appropriate geometrical mappings, and equivalence classes of
moments, in order to preserve the inter-element continuity of tangential
components of the magnetic field. Finally, we extend the proposed methodology
to generate global curl-conforming spaces on non-conforming hierarchically
refined (i.e., $h$-adaptive) meshes with arbitrary order finite elements.

derived from the original parallel corpus without any external labeled data or

to significant improvements in translation quality by being able to better
incorporate the external information, even in very noisy conditions.

layers which interact via an interlayer exchange coupling. One of these walls
is moved by a spin-polarized current. Depending on several parameters as the
current density, the interlayer coupling or the pinning potential, the combined
dynamics of the two domain walls can change very strongly allowing, e.g., for a
correlated motion of the walls. In addition, more subtle effect appear as a

optimize these parameters in sampling process. By doing so, an effectiveness

dimension that is smart evolution over time. However, currently, there is no
general formula to model and predict this extra dimension. Here, by starting
from fundamental concepts, we derive and validate a universal bi-exponential
formula that is required to model and predict the fourth D of 4D printed
multi-material structures. 4D printing is a new manufacturing paradigm to
elaborate stimuli-responsive materials in multi-material structures for
advanced manufacturing (and construction) of advanced products (and
structures). It conserves the general attributes of 3D printing (such as the
elimination of molds, dies, and machining) and further enables the fourth
dimension of products and structures to provide intelligent behavior over time.
This intelligent behavior is encoded (usually by an inverse mathematical
problem) into stimuli-responsive multi-materials during printing and is enabled
by stimuli after printing. Here, we delve into the fourth dimension and reveal
three general laws that govern the time-dependent shape-shifting behaviors of
almost all (photochemical-, photothermal-, solvent-, pH-, moisture-,
electrochemical-, electrothermal-, ultrasound-, enzyme-, etc.-responsive)
multi-material 4D structures. We demonstrate that two different types of
time-constants govern the shape-shifting behavior of almost all the
multi-material 4D printed structures over time. Our results starting from the
most fundamental concepts and ending with governing equations can serve as
general design principles for future research in the 4D printing field, where
the time-dependent behaviors should be understood, modeled, and predicted,
correctly. Future software and hardware developments in 4D printing can also
benefit from these results.

memory and logic applications through current-induced spin-transfer torques.
Enabling wider applications of such magnetic devices requires a lower switching
current for a smaller cell while keeping the thermal stability of magnetic
cells for non-volatility. As the cell size reduces, however, it becomes
extremely difficult to meet this requirement with ferromagnets because
spin-transfer torque for ferromagnets is a surface torque due to rapid spin
dephasing, leading to the 1/ferromagnet-thickness dependence of the spin-torque
efficiency. Requirement of a larger switching current for a thicker and thus
more thermally stable ferromagnetic cell is the fundamental obstacle for
high-density non-volatile applications with ferromagnets. Theories predicted
that antiferromagnets have a long spin coherence length due to the staggered
spin order on an atomic scale, thereby resolving the above fundamental
limitation. Despite several spin-torque experiments on antiferromagnets and
ferrimagnetic alloys, this prediction has remained unexplored. Here we report a
long spin coherence length and associated bulk-like-torque characteristic in an
antiferromagnetically coupled ferrimagnetic multilayer. We find that a
transverse spin current can pass through > 10 nm-thick ferrimagnetic Co/Tb
multilayers whereas it is entirely absorbed by 1 nm-thick ferromagnetic Co/Ni
multilayer. We also find that the switching efficiency of Co/Tb multilayers
partially reflects a bulk-like-torque characteristic as it increases with the
ferrimagnet-thickness up to 8 nm and then decreases, in clear contrast to
1/thickness-dependence of Co/Ni multilayers. Our results on
antiferromagnetically coupled systems will invigorate researches towards
energy-efficient spintronic technologies.

by automatically selecting its communicating users, power levels and
subchannels without any information exchange among UAVs. To model the
uncertainty of environments, we formulate the long-term resource allocation
problem as a stochastic game for maximizing the expected rewards, where each
UAV becomes a learning agent and each resource allocation solution corresponds
to an action taken by the UAVs. Afterwards, we develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that each agent discovers its best
strategy according to its local observations using learning. More specifically,
we propose an agent-independent method, for which all agents conduct a decision
algorithm independently but share a common structure based on Q-learning.
Finally, simulation results reveal that: 1) appropriate parameters for
exploitation and exploration are capable of enhancing the performance of the
proposed MARL based resource allocation algorithm; 2) the proposed MARL
algorithm provides acceptable performance compared to the case with complete
information exchanges among UAVs. By doing so, it strikes a good tradeoff

differentiated states is commonly mediated by gene regulatory motifs with
mutually exclusive expression states. The classical deterministic picture for
cell fate determination includes bistability and hysteresis, which enables the
persistence of the acquired cellular state after withdrawal of the stimulus,
ensuring a robust cellular response. However, the stochasticity inherent to
gene expression dynamics is not compatible with hysteresis, since the
stationary solution of the governing Chemical Master Equation does not depend
on the initial conditions. In this work, we provide a quantitative description
of a transient hysteresis phenomenon that reconciles experimental evidence of
hysteretic behaviour in gene regulatory networks with their inherent
stochasticity. Under sufficiently slow dynamics, the dependency of the
non-stationary solutions on the initial state of the cells can lead to what we
denote here as transient hysteresis. To quantify this phenomenon, we provide an
estimate of the convergence rate to the equilibrium. We also introduce the
equation of a natural landscape capturing the evolution of the system that,
unlike traditional cell fate potential landscapes, is compatible with the
notion of coexistence at the microscopic level.

ensures adaptability to technology scaling. The proposed algorithm STAIRoute
takes $O(n^2kt)$ time for a given design with $n$ blocks and $k$ nets having at
most $t$ terminals. Experimental results on a set of floorplanning benchmark
circuits show $100\%$ routing completion, with no over-congestion in the
routing regions reported. The wirelength for the $t$-terminal ($t\geq$ 2) nets
is comparable with the Steiner length computed by FLUTE. An estimation on the
number of vias for different capacity profiles is also presented, along with
congestion and runtime results.

through sublimation of dust grains at several tens of stellar radii. Nearly
1700 high resolution spectra of Beta Pictoris have been obtained from 2003 to

produced by evaporation of grains at about 0.3 au (38 Rstar) from the star.
Here we describe the yearly variations of the column densities of all Fe I
components (from both ground and excited levels). The drop in the Fe I ground
level column density after 2011 coincides with a drop in Fe I excited levels
column density, as well as in the Ca II doublet and a ground level Ca I line at
the same epoch. All drops are compatible together with
photoionisation-recombination equilibrium and Beta Pic like relative
abundances, in a medium at 1300 K and at 0.3 au from Beta Pictoris.

This work seeks to identify nearby young stars showing a Lithium 6707.78$\,\AA$

search for corresponding templates in the pool of 434,215 measured dwarf
spectra in the survey. It enables a model-free search for best-matching
spectral templates for all stars, including M dwarfs with strong molecular
absorption bands. 3147 stars have been found to have measurable Lithium: 1408 G

to investigate the possibility of searching for young stars above the main
sequence based merely on their parallaxes and broad-band photometry. Selection
of young stars above the main sequence is highly effective for M dwarfs,
moderately effective for K dwarfs and ineffective for G dwarfs. Using a
combination of the Lithium information and the complete 6D kinematics from Gaia

belong to the Scorpius-Centaurus association, 36 to the Pleiades and 25 to the

most of which use entropy as the main mathematical tool. *While a direct
generalization of the Shannon entropy to density matrices, the von Neumann
entropy behaves differently. A long-standing open question is, whether there
are quantum analogues of unconstrained non-Shannon type inequalities. Here, a
new constrained non-von-Neumann type inequality is proven, a step towards a
conjectured unconstrained inequality by Linden and Winter. *IID quantum state
merging can be optimally achieved using the decoupling technique. The one-shot
results by Berta et al. and Anshu at al., however, had to bring in additional
mathematical machinery. We introduce a natural generalized decoupling paradigm,
catalytic decoupling, that can reproduce the aforementioned results when used
analogously to the application of standard decoupling in the asymptotic case.
*Port based teleportation, a variant of standard quantum teleportation
protocol, cannot be implemented perfectly. We prove several lower bounds on the
necessary number of output ports N to achieve port based teleportation for
given error and input dimension, showing that N diverges uniformly in the
dimension of the teleported quantum system, for vanishing error. As a
byproduct, a new lower bound for the size of the program register for an
approximate universal programmable quantum processor is derived. *In the last
part, we give a new definition for information-theoretic quantum
non-malleability, strengthening the previous definition by Ambainis et al. We
show that quantum non-malleability implies secrecy, analogous to quantum
authentication. Furthermore, non-malleable encryption schemes can be used as a
primitive to build authenticating encryption schemes. We also show that the
strong notion of authentication recently proposed by Garg et al. can be
fulfilled using 2-designs.

large scale variation, moving object recognition and temporal consistency

Graphene-exposed astrocytes acquire a more differentiated morphological

functional alterations are induced by GO internalization, including the
upregulation of inward-rectifying K+ channels and of Na+-dependent glutamate
uptake, which are linked to the astrocyte capacity to control the extracellular

that graphene nanomaterials profoundly affect astrocyte physiology in vitro,

sections in analytical form for rovibrational energy excitation and
dissociation of a molecular gas. The method is applied to an ab initio database
for the N2-N system devel- oped at NASA Ames Research Center. The detailed
information on N2 +N collisions contained in this database has been reduced by
adapting a Uniform RoVibrational- Collisional bin model originally developed
for rate coefficients. Using a 10-bin system as an example, a comparison is
made between two sets of coarse-grain cross sections, obtained by analytical
inversion and direct binning respectively. The analytical in- version approach
is especially powerful, because it manages to compress the entire set of
rovibrational-level-specific data from the Ames database into a much smaller
set of numerical parameters, sufficient to reconstruct all coarse-grain cross
sections for any particular N2 +N-collision pair. As a result of this approach,
the computational cost in in large-scale Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
flow simulations is sig- nificantly reduced, both in terms of memory
requirements and execution time. The intended application is the simulation of
high-temperature gas-dynamics phenomena in shock-heated flows via the DSMC
method. Such conditions are typically encoun- tered in high-altitude,
high-speed atmospheric entry, or in shock-tube experiments. Using this
coarse-grain model together with ab initio rate data will enable more accu-
rate modeling nonequilibrium phenomena, such as vibrationally-favored
dissociation, an effect that is not well-captured by the conventional models
prevalent in DSMC (i.e. Larsen-Borgnakke and Total Collision Energy).

derive the optimal conditions for the non-linear parameter and the on-site

show that the non-linearity yields a high-efficiency plateau for the condensate
transport as a function of the on-site energy difference between the outermost

different non-linearities in each well, which, for certain parameter values,
leads to an increase of the width of this plateau.

increasing need for outsourcing such tasks to third-party analysts. However,
organizations are usually reluctant to share their network traces due to
privacy concerns over sensitive information, e.g., network and system
configuration, which may potentially be exploited for attacks. In cases where
data owners are convinced to share their network traces, the data are typically
subjected to certain anonymization techniques, e.g., CryptoPAn, which replaces
real IP addresses with prefix-preserving pseudonyms. However, most such
techniques either are vulnerable to adversaries with prior knowledge about some
network flows in the traces, or require heavy data sanitization or
perturbation, both of which may result in a significant loss of data utility.
In this paper, we aim to preserve both privacy and utility through shifting the
trade-off from between privacy and utility to between privacy and computational
cost. The key idea is for the analysts to generate and analyze multiple
anonymized views of the original network traces; those views are designed to be
sufficiently indistinguishable even to adversaries armed with prior knowledge,
which preserves the privacy, whereas one of the views will yield true analysis
results privately retrieved by the data owner, which preserves the utility. We
present the general approach and instantiate it based on CryptoPAn. We formally
analyze the privacy of our solution and experimentally evaluate it using real
network traces provided by a major ISP. The results show that our approach can
significantly reduce the level of information leakage (e.g., less than 1\% of
the information leaked by CryptoPAn) with comparable utility.

presents a framework to examine the tradeoff between estimation and
approximation errors, and between prediction and interpretation losses. It
operationalizes the DNN interpretability in the choice analysis by formulating
the metrics of interpretation loss as the difference between true and estimated
choice probability functions. This study also uses the statistical learning
theory to upper bound the estimation error of both prediction and
interpretation losses in DNN, shedding light on why DNN does not have the
overfitting issue. Three scenarios are then simulated to compare DNN to binary
logit model (BNL). We found that DNN outperforms BNL in terms of both
prediction and interpretation for most of the scenarios, and larger sample size
unleashes the predictive power of DNN but not BNL. DNN is also used to analyze
the choice of trip purposes and travel modes based on the National Household
Travel Survey 2017 (NHTS2017) dataset. These experiments indicate that DNN can
be used for choice analysis beyond the current practice of demand forecasting
because it has the inherent utility interpretation, the flexibility of
accommodating various information formats, and the power of automatically
learning utility specification. DNN is both more predictive and interpretable
than BNL unless the modelers have complete knowledge about the choice task, and
the sample size is small. Overall, statistical learning theory can be a
foundation for future studies in the non-asymptotic data regime or using
high-dimensional statistical models in choice analysis, and the experiments
show the feasibility and effectiveness of DNN for its wide applications to
policy and behavioral analysis.

emergence of item typicality and category coherence as factors controlling the

architecture common in systems optimized for efficient information
transmission. We test the hypothesis that the expositional structure of

the scaling law changes as the article's information transmission capacity
changes. Using 32 scientific manuscripts - each containing between three and 26
iterations of revision - we construct semantic networks in which nodes
represented unique words in each manuscript, and edges connect nodes if two
words appeared within the same 5-word window. We show that these semantic
networks display clear Rentian scaling, and that the Rent exponent varies over
the publication life cycle, from the first draft to the final revision.
Furthermore, we observe that manuscripts fell into three clusters in terms of
how the scaling exponents changed across drafts: exponents rising over time,
falling over time, and remaining relatively stable over time. This change in
exponent reflects the evolution in semantic network structure over the
manuscript revision process, highlighting a balance between network complexity,
which increases the exponent, and network efficiency, which decreases the
exponent. Lastly, the final value of the Rent exponent is negatively correlated

As such it is commonly used in a number of contexts, for example to predict the

$T$-matrix for electromagnetic scattering can be divided into four blocks
corresponding physically to coupling between either magnetic or electric
multipolar fields. Analytic expressions were recently derived for the

water desalination. By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we show fast
water transport through graphene galleries at a temperature gradient. Water
molecules are driven to migrate through nanometer-wide graphene channels from
cold reservoir to hot reservoir by the effect of thermal creep flow. Reducing
the interlayer spacing to 6.5 {\AA}, an abrupt escalation occurs in water
permeation between angstrom-distance graphene slabs. The change from disordered
bulklike water to quasi-square structure have been found under this extremely
confined condition. This leads to a transition to subcontinuum transport. Water
molecules perform collective diffusion behaviors inside graphene channels. The
special transport processes with structure change convert thermal energy into
motion without dissipation, resulting in unexpected high water permeability.
The thermal-driven system reaches maximum flowrate at temperature variance of
80 K, corresponding to the quantity at pressure difference up to 10^5 bar in
commercial reverse osmosis processes and 230 bar in pressure-driven slip flow.
Our results also reveal the movement of saline ions influenced by
thermophoretic effect, which complement the geometry limitation at greater
layer spacing, enhancing the blockage of ions. This finding aims to provide an
innovational idea of developing a high-efficiency desalination technology able

diagonal preconditioner, which is based on a partial singular value
decomposition of the MSS constraint matrix. The preconditioner can be computed
using matrix-vector products only (i.e. it is matrix-free) and is fully
parallelised in the time domain. Two chaotic systems are considered, the Lorenz
system and the 1D Kuramoto Sivashinsky equation. Combination of the
preconditioner with a regularisation method leads to tight bracketing of the
eigenvalues to a narrow range. This combination results in a significant
reduction in the number of iterations, and renders the convergence rate almost
independent of the number of degrees of freedom of the system, and the length
of the trajectory that is used to compute the time-averaged objective. This can
potentially allow the method to be used for large chaotic systems (such as
turbulent flows) and optimal control applications. The singular value
decomposition of the constraint matrix can also be used to quantify the effect
of the system condition on the accuracy of the sensitivities. In fact,
neglecting the singular modes affected by noise, we recover the correct values
of sensitivity that match closely with those obtained with finite differences
for the Kuramoto Sivashinsky equation in the light turbulent regime.

well-known scale-effect of reduced apparent reaction rates between chemically
dissimilar fluids at larger scales (or dimensional averaging). The dispersion
tensor in the ADRE must equally and simultaneously account for both solute
mixing and spreading. Recent reactive-particle-tracking (RPT) algorithms can,
by separate mechanisms, simulate 1) smaller-scale mixing by inter-particle mass
transfer, and 2) mass spreading by traditional random walks. To test the
supposition that the RPT can accurately track these separate mechanisms, we
upscale reactive transport in Hagen-Poiseuille flow between two plates. The
simple upscaled 1-D RPT model with one velocity value, an upscaled Taylor
macro-dispersivity, and the local molecular diffusion coefficient matches the
results obtained from a detailed 2-D model with fully described velocity and
diffusion. Both models use the same thermodynamic reaction rate, because the
rate is not forced to absorb the loss of information upon upscaling. Analytic
and semi-analytic upscaling is also performed using volume averaging and
ensemble streamtube techniques. Volume averaging does not perform as well as
the RPT, while ensemble streamtubes (using an effective dispersion coefficient
along with macro-dispersion) perform almost exactly the same as RPT.

covers all experimental contents required by traditional digital logic
experiment classes. It allows the students to draw circuit diagrams or to write
VHDL code to design their own circuits, and it provides complete simulation
functions. DCLab records the progress of each student and makes it convenient
for a student to review the history of his practice. Furthermore, for the
instructors, they are able to post homework assignments on DCLab, and the
system will automatically add homework projects to the students' home pages.
Statistics about how the students perform on the homework will be displayed to
the instructors, which may help them develop more effective courses. We have
tested DCLab among students in the digital logic course, and the results have
confirmed its validity.

exocomets in various systems, this study examines the dynamics of possible
comets around 47 UMa. Based on the assumption that most systems hosting planets
should also harbor leftovers from planet formation processes, comets are thus
also expected to exist in the system of 47 UMa. This system is known to host
three Jupiter-type planets; however, based on stability analyses, additional
terrestrial planets in stable orbits might also be able to exist, including
planets in 47 UMa's habitable zone. Furthermore, we also consider a possible
'Hilda'-planet. The aim of our study is to explore the interaction of exocomets
with the Jupiter-type planets in the system and examine the probability of
cometary collisions with the planets, including possible Earth-mass planets
located in the habitable zone. Moreover, we investigate the transport of water
onto the Earth-mass planets, including quantitative estimates. It is found that
the Earth-mass planets would be able to receive some water, but much less than
currently present on Earth. We also checked if the comets form families, but no
families were found. Finally, the capture of comets in close orbits and the
possibility of small clouds formed when comets come too close to the star and
disintegrate are also part of our work.

that is equivalent to a zero-temperature Ising model with Glauber dynamics, or
an Asynchronous Cellular Automaton (ACA) with extended Moore neighborhoods.
Previous work has shown that if the intolerance parameter of the model $\tau\in
(\sim 0.488,\sim 0.512) \setminus \{1/2\}$, then for a sufficiently large
neighborhood of interaction $N$, any particle will end up in an exponentially
large monochromatic region almost surely.
  This paper extends the above result to the interval $\tau \in (\sim
0.433,\sim 0.567) \setminus \{1/2\}$. We also improve the bounds on the size of
the monochromatic region by exponential factors in $N$. Finally, we show that
when particles are placed on the infinite lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ rather than on
a flat torus, for the values of $\tau$ mentioned above, sufficiently large $N$,
and after a sufficiently long evolution time, any particle is contained in a
large monochromatic region of size exponential in $N$, almost surely. The new
proof, critically relies on a novel geometric construction related to the
formation of the monochromatic region.

  Spatio-Temporal Error Backpropagation","19 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.NE cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered a great amount of interest for
supervised and unsupervised learning applications. This paper deals with the
problem of training multi-layer feedforward SNNs. The non-linear
integrate-and-fire dynamics employed by spiking neurons make it difficult to
train SNNs to generate desired spike trains in response to a given input. To
tackle this, first the problem of training a multi-layer SNN is formulated as
an optimization problem such that its objective function is based on the
deviation in membrane potential rather than the spike arrival instants. Then,
an optimization method named Normalized Approximate Descent (NormAD),
hand-crafted for such non-convex optimization problems, is employed to derive
the iterative synaptic weight update rule. Next, it is reformulated to
efficiently train multi-layer SNNs, and is shown to be effectively performing
spatio-temporal error backpropagation. The learning rule is validated by
training $2$-layer SNNs to solve a spike based formulation of the XOR problem
as well as training $3$-layer SNNs for generic spike based training problems.
Thus, the new algorithm is a key step towards building deep spiking neural
networks capable of efficient event-triggered learning.

method for plug-in electric vehicles charging stations based on simulation and
genetic algorithm. In this research, reasonable user behaviors changes i.e.,
detouring for recharging, is included in the method for more practical
application. A detailed logic for describing the plug-in electric vehicles
users' detour behaviors is designed in this paper for the charging station
deployment evaluation and further influence the later charging station planning
strategy formulation. Intuitively, by taking the behaviors change of plug-in
electric vehicles users after a charging station deployment is given into
account, our evaluation method is the more reasonable. Actually a series of
control experiments should be carried out to illustrate the different insights
from our method. However, in this paper, due to the limited space, we just
provide the result of our method in a relatively simple case with some
analyses. Different insights from our method may work as useful suggestion for

due to meta-atom resonant frequency tuning as a function of external dc and rf

contrast, the spatial coherence improves dramatically upon increasing of rf

on future generations, and the environment, for an extremely long time. Nuclear
processes, and products, are activated at energies millions of times higher
than the energies of chemical processes, and consequently they cannot be
eliminated by the natural environment on Earth. So it turns out that hundreds
of nuclear tests performed in the atmosphere left a huge radioactive
contamination; Rosalie Bertell estimated 1,300 millions victims of the Nuclear
Age; civil nuclear programs have produced enormous quantities of radioactive
waste, whose final disposal has not been solved by any country; decommissioning
of tens of shut down nuclear plants shall involve costs which were
underestimated in the past; spent nuclear fuel accumulates in decontamination
pools, or in dry cask storage, but no final storage has been carried out yet;
radioactivity of spent fuel will last for tens of thousand years; military
nuclear programs leave, besides almost 15,000 nuclear warheads, approximately
1,300 metric tons of plutonium; even mining of natural uranium was, and is,
carried out mainly by poor and exploited populations, which suffer serious
health consequences; paradoxically enough (or maybe not), French territory
itself is widely contaminated. All these facts have been downplayed during the
whole history of the Nuclear Age. Future generations shall not be grateful.
