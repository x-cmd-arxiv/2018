probability using rough paths. By encoding the volatility of assets in an
enhancement of the price trajectory, we give a pathwise presentation of the
replication of European options. The continuity properties of rough-paths allow
us to generalise the so-called fundamental theorem of derivative trading,
showing that a small misspecification of the model will yield only a small
excess profit or loss of the replication strategy. Our hedging strategy is an
enhanced version of classical delta hedging where we use volatility swaps to
hedge the second order terms arising in rough-path integrals, resulting in
improved robustness.

in Bayesian inverse problems is challenging when evaluations of the forward
model are computationally expensive. Replacing the forward model with a
low-cost, low-fidelity model often significantly reduces computational cost;
however, employing a low-fidelity model alone means that the stationary
distribution of the MCMC chain is the posterior distribution corresponding to
the low-fidelity model, rather than the original posterior distribution
corresponding to the high-fidelity model. We propose a multifidelity approach
that combines, rather than replaces, the high-fidelity model with a
low-fidelity model. First, the low-fidelity model is used to construct a
transport map that deterministically couples a reference Gaussian distribution
with an approximation of the low-fidelity posterior. Then, the high-fidelity
posterior distribution is explored using a non-Gaussian proposal distribution
derived from the transport map. This multifidelity ""preconditioned"" MCMC
approach seeks efficient sampling via a proposal that is explicitly tailored to
the posterior at hand and that is constructed efficiently with the low-fidelity
model. By relying on the low-fidelity model only to construct the proposal
distribution, our approach guarantees that the stationary distribution of the
MCMC chain is the high-fidelity posterior. In our numerical examples, our
multifidelity approach achieves significant speedups compared to
single-fidelity MCMC sampling methods.

explicit structure guaranteeing the complete positivity (CP) and
trace-preservation (TP) of the real-time evolution expansion in terms of the
microscopic system-environment coupling.
  This reveals a fundamental two-stage structure of the coupling expansion:
Whereas the first stage defines the dissipative timescales of the system
--before having integrated out the environment completely-- the second stage
sums up elementary physical processes described by CP superoperators. This
allows us to establish the nontrivial relation between the (Nakajima-Zwanzig)
memory-kernel superoperator for the density operator and novel memory-kernel
operators that generate the Kraus operators of an operator-sum. Importantly,
this operational approach can be implemented in the existing Keldysh real-time
technique and allows approximations for general time-nonlocal quantum master
equations to be systematically compared and developed while keeping the CP and
TP structure explicit.
  Our considerations build on the result that a Kraus operator for a physical
measurement process on the environment can be obtained by 'cutting' a group of
Keldysh real-time diagrams 'in half'. This naturally leads to Kraus operators
lifted to the system plus environment which have a diagrammatic expansion in
terms of time-nonlocal memory-kernel operators. These lifted Kraus operators
obey coupled time-evolution equations which constitute an unraveling of the
original Schr\""odinger equation for system plus environment. Whereas both
equations lead to the same reduced dynamics, only the former explicitly encodes
the operator-sum structure of the coupling expansion.

sensitive applications, allowing geographically separate musicians to perform
seamlessly as a tele-orchestra. For this application type, the QoS indicator is
the mouth-to-ear delay, which should be kept under 25 milliseconds. The
mouth-to-ear delay comprises signal processing latency and network delay. We
propose a strong collaboration between the network and NMP applications to
\emph{actively} keep the to mouth-to-ear delay minimal, using direct state
notifications. Related approaches can be characterized as \emph{passive}, since
they try to estimate the network state indirectly, based on the end application
performance. Our solution employs Software Defined Networking (SDN) to
implement the network-to-application collaboration, being facilitated by the
well-defined network interface that SDN offers. Emulation results show that the
proposed scheme achieves an improvement of up to 59% in mouth-to-ear delay over
the existing passive solutions.

different places who perform music while staying synchronized via the Internet.
The maximum end-to-end delay in NMP applications is called Ensemble Performance
Threshold (EPT) and should be less than 25 milliseconds. Due to this
constraint, NMPs require ultra-low delay solutions for audio coding, network
transmission, relaying and decoding, each one a challenging task on its own.
There are two directions for study in the related work referring to the NMP
systems. From the audio perspective, researchers experiment on low-delay
encoders and transmission patterns, aiming to reduce the processing delay of
the audio transmission, but they ignore the network performance. On the other
hand, network-oriented researchers try to reduce the network delay, which
contributes to reduced end-to-end delay. In our proposed approach, we introduce
an integration of dynamic audio and network configuration to satisfy the EPT
constraint. The basic idea is that the major components participating in an NMP
system the application and the network interact during the live music
performance. As the network delay increases, the network tries to equalize it
by modifying the routing behavior using Software Defined Networking principles.
If the network delay exceeds a maximum affordable threshold, the network reacts
by informing the application to change the audio processing pattern to overcome
the delay increase, resulting in below EPT end-to-end delay. A full prototype
of the proposed system was implemented and extensively evaluated in an emulated
environment.

Due to the Jahn Teller effect in combination with the strong static Coulomb
interaction, the octahedra in high Tc cuprates are elongated along the c axis,
leading to a 3dx2-y2 orbital at the top of the band structure wherein the doped
holes reside.This scenario gives rise to two dimensional characteristics in
high Tc cuprates that favor d wave pairing symmetry. Here we report
superconductivity in a cuprate Ba2CuO4-y wherein the local octahedron is in a

expressed in some logic into a system of some kind. This thesis has two parts,
devoted to logic and to systems.
  In Part I, we develop two new approaches to CTL* synthesis. The first
approach consists of two extensions of the SMT-based bounded synthesis: one
follows bottom-up CTL* model checking, another one follows the automata
framework. The second approach reduces CTL* synthesis to LTL synthesis. The
reduction turns any LTL synthesiser into a CTL* synthesiser. The two approaches
were implemented and are available online.
  In Part II, we study parameterized synthesis for two system architectures.
The first architecture is guarded systems and is inspired by cache coherence
protocols. In guarded systems, processes transitions are enabled or disabled
depending on the existence of other processes in certain local states. The
existing cutoff results for guarded protocols are restricted to closed systems,
and are of limited use for liveness properties. We close these gaps and prove
tight cutoffs for open systems with liveness properties, and also cutoffs for
detecting deadlocks. The second architecture is token-ring systems, where the
single token circulates processes arranged in a ring. The experiments with the
existing parameterized synthesis method showed that it does not scale to large
specifications. First, we optimize the method by refining the cutoff reduction,
using modularity and abstraction. The evaluation show several orders of
magnitude speed-ups. Second, we perform parameterized synthesis case study on
the industrial arbiter protocol AMBA. We describe new tricks ---a new cutoff
extension and decompositional synthesis--- that, together with the previously
described optimizations, allowed us to synthesize AMBA in a parameterized
setting, for the first time.

low energy ($\leq300$ keV) protons that are potentially able to scatter on the
reflecting surface of Wolter-I optics of X-ray focusing telescopes and reach
the focal plane. This phenomenon, depending on the X-ray instrumentation, can
dramatically increase the background level, reducing the sensitivity or, in the
most extreme cases, compromising the observation itself. The use of a magnetic
diverter, deflecting protons away from the field of view, requires a detailed
characterization of their angular and energy distribution when exiting the
mirror. We present the first end-to-end Geant4 simulation of proton scattering
by X-ray optics and the consequent interaction with the diverter field and the
X-ray detector assembly, selecting the ATHENA Wide Field Imager as a case study
for the evaluation of the residual soft proton induced background. We obtain
that, in absence of a magnetic diverter, protons are indeed funneled towards
the focal plane, with a focused Non X-ray Background well above the level
required by ATHENA science objectives ($5\times10^{-4}$ counts cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$), for all the plasma regimes encountered in both L1 and L2
orbits. These results set the proton diverter as a mandatory shielding system
on board the ATHENA mission and all high throughput X-ray telescopes operating
in the interplanetary space. For a magnetic field computed to deflect 99\% of
the protons that would otherwise reach the WFI, Geant4 simulations show that
this configuration, in the assumption of a uniform field, would efficiently
shield the focal plane, yielding a residual background level of the order or
below the requirement.

In the mesoscopic regime, density correlations are much weaker than in the
microscopic regime. Our result is an explicit formula for the two-point
function. This formula implies that the WGMD statistics are valid to leading
order on all mesoscopic scales, that in the real symmetric case there are
subleading corrections matching precisely the WGMD statistics, while in the

polynomials in the entries of the Green function. The hierarchy is indexed by a

taking place not so far from the plane of the sky, with an angle of

(CVs) is the lack of observations of systems with periods between 2 and 3.12
hours, known as the period gap. The orbital evolution of CVs with periods
shorter than those in the gap is dominated by gravitational radiation while for
periods exceeding those of the gap it is dominated by magnetic braking of the
secondary star. Spruit & Ritter (1983) showed that as periods approach 3 hours
and secondary stars become fully convective a sharp decline in magnetic dynamo
and braking efficiency would result in such a gap. Recent X-ray observations
finding coronal magnetic energy dissipation is similar in fully convective and
partly radiative M dwarfs cast this theory into doubt. In this work, we use
Zeeman-Doppler imaging observations culled from the literature to show that the
complexity of the surface magnetic fields of rapidly rotating M dwarfs
increases with decreasing rotation period. Garraffo et al. (2018) have shown
that the efficiency of angular momentum loss of cool stars declines strongly
with increasing complexity of their surface magnetic field. We explore the idea
of Taam & Spruit (1989) that magnetic complexity might then explain the period
gap. By generating synthetic CV populations using a schematic CV evolutionary
approach, we show that the CV period gap can naturally arise as a consequence
of a rise in secondary star magnetic complexity near the long period edge of
the gap that renders a sharp decline in their angular momentum loss rate.

at lower masses. Employing a semi-analytical model to simulate the combined
evolution of BHs and their host galaxies, we predict the observational
consequences of assuming a bimodality in the accretion efficiency of BHs, with
low-mass BHs ($M_{\bullet} \lesssim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$) accreting
inefficiently. We predict a departure from the $M_{\bullet} - \sigma$ relation
at a transitional BH mass $\sim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$, with lower-mass BHs unable
to reach the mass dictated by the relation and becoming disconnected from the
evolution of the host galaxy. This prediction is an alternative to previous
works suggesting a flattening of the relation at $\sim 10^5-10^6 \, M_{\odot}$.
Furthermore, we predict a deficit of BHs shining at bolometric luminosities
$\sim 10^{42} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$. Joined with a detection bias, this
could partly explain the scarce number of intermediate-mass BHs detected.
Conversely, we predict an increase in source density at lower bolometric

relations between the density response of the gas disk of a spiral galaxy and
the pericenter distance and mass ratio of a perturbing satellite. From the
analysis of results from a test particle code, we obtained a simple scaling
relation for the density response due to a single satellite interacting with a
galactic disk, over a wide range of satellite masses and pericenter distances.
We have also explored the effects of multiple satellites on the galactic disk,
focusing on cases that are commonly found in cosmological simulations. Here, we
use orbits for the satellites that are drawn from cosmological simulations. For
these cases, we compare our approximate scaling relations to the density
response generated by satellites, and find that for two satellite interactions,
our scaling relations approximately recover the response of the galactic disk.
We have also examined the observed HI data in the outskirts of several spiral
galaxies from the THINGS sample and compared the observed perturbations to that
of cosmological simulations and our own scaling relations. While small
perturbations can be excited by satellites drawn from cosmological simulations,
we find that large perturbations (such as those that are seen in some THINGS
galaxies like M51) are not recovered by satellites drawn from cosmological

their degenerate core as a flash. Stellar evolution codes predict that the He
flash consists of a series of consecutive subflashes. The detection of mixed
modes in red giants from space missions CoRoT and Kepler has opened new
opportunities to search for stars in this evolution stage. During a subflash,
the He burning shell is convective, which splits the cavity of gravity modes in
two. We here investigate how this additional cavity modifies the oscillation
spectrum of the star. We calculate the asymptotic mode frequencies of stellar
models going through a He subflash using the JWKB approximation. To predict the
detectability of the modes, we estimate their expected heights, taking into
account the effects of radiative damping in the core. Our results are then
compared to the oscillation spectra obtained by calculating numerically the
mode frequencies during a He subflash. We show that during a He subflash, the
detectable oscillation spectrum mainly consists of modes trapped in the
acoustic cavity and in the outer g-mode cavity. The spectrum should thus
resemble that of a core-helium-burning giant. However, we find a list of clear,
detectable features that could enable us to identify red giants passing through
a He subflash. In particular, during a He subflash, several modes that are
trapped in the innermost g-mode cavity are expected to be detectable. We show
that these modes could be identified by their frequencies or by their
rotational splittings. Other features, such as the measured period spacing of
gravity modes or the location of the H-burning shell within the g-mode cavity
could also be used to identify stars going through a He subflash. The features
derived in this study can now be searched for in the large datasets provided by

evidence. First, astrophysical and geophysical studies provide a timescale for
the formation of Earth and the Moon, for large impact events on early Earth,
and for the cooling of the early magma ocean. From this evidence, we can deduce
a habitability boundary, which is the earliest point at which Earth became
habitable. Second, biosignatures in geological samples, including microfossils,
stromatolites, and chemical isotope ratios, provide evidence for when life was
actually present. From these observations we can deduce a biosignature
boundary, which is the earliest point at which there is clear evidence that
life existed. Studies with molecular phylogenetics and records of the changing
level of oxygen in the atmosphere give additional information that helps to
determine the biosignature boundary. Here, we review the data from a wide range
of disciplines to summarize current information on the timings of these two
boundaries. The habitability boundary could be as early as 4.5 Ga, the earliest
possible estimate of the time at which Earth had a stable crust and
hydrosphere, or as late as 3.9 Ga, the end of the period of heavy meteorite
bombardment. The lack of consensus on whether there was a late heavy meteorite
bombardment that was significant enough to prevent life is the largest
uncertainty in estimating the time of the habitability boundary. The
biosignature boundary is more closely constrained. Evidence from carbon isotope

chromosphere is a challenging task. The Stokes Q and U profiles are dominated
by the scattering polarisation and the Hanle effect, and these processes can
only be correctly quantified if 3D radiative transfer effects are taken into
account. Forward-modelling of the intensity and polarisation of spectral lines
using a 3D model atmosphere is a suitable approach in order to statistically
compare the theoretical and observed line profiles. Our aim is to present novel
observations of the Ca 8542 line profiles in a quiet region at the centre of
the solar disc and to quantitatively compare them with the theoretical Stokes
profiles. We aim at estimating the reliability of the 3D model atmosphere using
not only the line intensity but the full vector of Stokes parameters. We used
data obtained with the ZIMPOL instrument at the IRSOL and compared the
observations with the theoretical profiles computed with the PORTA radiative
transfer code, using as solar model atmosphere a 3D snapshot taken from a
radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulation. The synthetic profiles were degraded
to match the instrument and observing conditions. The degraded theoretical
profiles of the Ca 8542 line are qualitatively similar to the observed ones. We
confirm that there is a fundamental difference in the widths of all Stokes
profiles: the observed lines are wider than the theoretical lines. We find that
the amplitudes of the observed profiles are larger than those of the
theoretical ones, which suggests that the symmetry breaking effects in the
solar chromosphere are stronger than in the model atmosphere. This means that
the isosurfaces of temperature, velocity, and magnetic field strength and
orientation are more corrugated in the solar chromosphere than in the currently
available 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulation.

rotation of linearly polarized radiation. However, pulses propagating through

circularly polarized components with measurable differences in arrival times

refraction from gradients in DM (dispersion measure) and RM can contribute a
splitting time $\propto \vert \mathbf{\nabla_{\perp}} \rm DM \vert \vert

emitted pulse is unpolarized or linearly polarized, net circular polarization
will be measured when splitting is a significant fraction of the pulse width.
However, the initial polarization may be inferable from the noise statistics of
the bursts. Extreme multipath scattering that broadens pulses can mask
splitting effects. We discuss particular cases such as the Galactic center
magnetar, J1749$-$2900, and the repeating fast radio burst source, FRB 121102.

reveal diverse morphology in (sub-)millimeter continuum, including a full disk
without significant radial structure, a transition disk with an inner cavity, a
disk with a single gap and a central continuum peak, and a disk with multiple
rings and gaps. Such a diversity originates from (1) the level of viscous
transport in the disk which determines the number of gaps a planet can open;
(2) the size and spatial distributions of grains determined by the coagulation,
fragmentation, and radial drift, which in turn affects the emmisivity of the
disk at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths; and (3) the angular resolution used to
observe the disk. In particular, our results show that disks having the same
underlying gas distribution can have very different grain size/spatial
distributions and thus appearance in continuum, depending on the interplay
among coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift. This suggests that proper
treatments for the grain growth have to be included in models of protoplanetary
disks concerning continuum properties and that complementary molecular line
observations are highly desired in addition to continuum observations to reveal
the true nature of disks. The fact that a single planet can produce diverse
disk morphology emphasizes the need to search for more direct, localized
signatures of planets in order to confirm (or dispute) the planetary origin of

cluster-wise cooperative EAD (Coop-EAD) application for CAVs to further reduce
energy consumption compared to existing Ego-EAD applications. Instead of
considering CAVs traveling through signalized intersections one at a time, our
approach strategically coordinates CAVs' maneuvers to form clusters using
various operating modes: initial vehicle clustering, intra-cluster sequence

applied to the cluster leader, and CAVs in the cluster follow the cluster
leader to conduct EAD maneuvers. A preliminary simulation study with a given

effects are systematically accounted for through large configuration state
function (CSF) expansions. Calculated excitation energies are found to be in
excellent agreement with experimental data from the NIST database. Lifetimes
and transition data for radiative electric dipole (E1) transitions are given
and compared with results from previous calculations and available
measurements, for both Al I and Al II. The computed lifetimes of Al I are in
very good agreement with the measured lifetimes in high-precision laser
spectroscopy experiments. The present calculations provide a substantial amount
of updated atomic data, including transition data in the infrared region. This
is particularly important since the new generation of telescopes are designed
for this region. There is a significant improvement in accuracy, in particular
for the more complex system of neutral Al I. The complete tables of transition
data are available.

from which the language originates. For example, it may be inaccurate to assume
people in Mobile, Alabama, where the population is relatively older, will use
words the same way as those from San Francisco, where the median age is younger
with a higher rate of college education. In this paper, we present residualized
factor adaptation, a novel approach to community prediction tasks which both
(a) effectively integrates community attributes, as well as (b) adapts
linguistic features to community attributes (factors). We use eleven
demographic and socioeconomic attributes, and evaluate our approach over five
different community-level predictive tasks, spanning health (heart disease
mortality, percent fair/poor health), psychology (life satisfaction), and
economics (percent housing price increase, foreclosure rate). Our evaluation
shows that residualized factor adaptation significantly improves 4 out of 5
community-level outcome predictions over prior state-of-the-art for
incorporating socio-demographic contexts.

all the data are consistent with a picture in which there are numerous

could occur by the previously-suggested mechanism of coupling to the MHD

nanoparticle detection. In order to achieve a higher sensitivity, thin
nanopores, such as silicon nitride pores, are usually considered. In this
paper, nanoparticle detection has been mimicked by simulations. We found the
surface charges of the particle can affect the current blockade obviously in
short pores, especially under high electric fields. For particles with a
surface charge density higher than -0.02 C/m2, its current blockade ratio
depends on the applied voltage closely. From our simulation results, an optimal
voltage can be found for the particle detection, under which the current
blockade ratio does not depend on the surface charge density of the particle.
This optimal voltage was obtained by the balance of current increase and
decrease caused by cations and anions, respectively, due to the negative
surface charges of particles. From the systematical study, the optimal voltage
was found to work like a property of the system which only depends on the
electrolyte type. We think our finding can provide some help to the accurate
particle detection in experiments.

variety of problems, such as model fitting. For this reason, there is interest
in creating differentially private versions of them. However, their conversion
to differentially private algorithms is often naive. For instance, a fixed
number of iterations are chosen, the privacy budget is split evenly among them,
and at each iteration, parameters are updated with a noisy gradient. In this
paper, we show that gradient-based algorithms can be improved by a more careful
allocation of privacy budget per iteration. Intuitively, at the beginning of
the optimization, gradients are expected to be large, so that they do not need
to be measured as accurately. However, as the parameters approach their optimal
values, the gradients decrease and hence need to be measured more accurately.
We add a basic line-search capability that helps the algorithm decide when more
accurate gradient measurements are necessary. Our gradient descent algorithm
works with the recently introduced zCDP version of differential privacy. It
outperforms prior algorithms for model fitting and is competitive with the
state-of-the-art for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy, a strictly
weaker definition than zCDP.

Logistic regression is modelled to capture linear interactions but neglects the

parameters $\lambda$ is central to many studies of high-dimensional model
systems in physics, e.g. large molecules or spin glasses. In simulations this
usually requires sampling conformational transitions or phase transitions, but
efficient sampling is often difficult to attain due to the roughness of the
energy landscape. For Boltzmann distributions, crossing rates decrease
exponentially with free-energy barrier heights. Thus, exponential acceleration
can be achieved in simulations by applying an artificial bias along $\lambda$
tuned such that a flat target distribution is obtained. A flat distribution is
however an ambiguous concept unless a proper metric is used, and is generally
suboptimal. Here we propose a multidimensional Riemann metric, which takes the
local diffusion into account, and redefine uniform sampling such that it is
invariant under nonlinear coordinate transformations. We use the metric in
combination with the accelerated weight histogram method, a free-energy
calculation and sampling method, to adaptively optimize sampling toward the
target distribution prescribed by the metric. We demonstrate that for complex
problems, such as molecular dynamics simulations of DNA base-pair opening,
sampling uniformly according to the metric, which can be calculated without
significant computational overhead, improves sampling efficiency by 50-70%.

partially solved by adding skip connections between layers, such as residual
LSTM. In this paper, we propose a layer trajectory LSTM (ltLSTM) which builds a
layer-LSTM using all the layer outputs from a standard multi-layer time-LSTM.
This layer-LSTM scans the outputs from time-LSTMs, and uses the summarized
layer trajectory information for final senone classification. The
forward-propagation of time-LSTM and layer-LSTM can be handled in two separate
threads in parallel so that the network computation time is the same as the
standard time-LSTM. With a layer-LSTM running through layers, a gated path is
provided from the output layer to the bottom layer, alleviating the gradient
vanishing issue. Trained with 30 thousand hours of EN-US Microsoft internal

multi-layer LSTM and residual LSTM, with up to 9.0% relative word error rate
reduction across different tasks.

consider the enumeration of top-k degree-based quasi-cliques, and make the

fluctuations presumably play an important role in inducing high temperature
superconductivity. In some cases, these two seemingly incompatible orders
coexist microscopically. Therefore, understanding how this unique coexistence
state is affected by disorder can provide important information about the
microscopic mechanisms involved. In one of the most studied pnictide family,
hole-doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ (BaK122), this coexistence occurs over a
wide range of doping levels, 0.16~$\lesssim x \lesssim $~0.25. We used
relativistic 2.5 MeV electrons to induce vacancy-interstitial (Frenkel) pairs
that act as efficient point-like scattering centers. Upon increasing dose of
irradiation, the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ decreases
dramatically. In the absence of nodes in the order parameter this provides a
strong support for a sign-changing $s_{\pm}$ pairing. Simultaneously, in the
normal state, there is a strong violation of the Matthiessen's rule and a
decrease (surprisingly, at the same rate as $T_c$) of the magnetic transition
temperature $T_{sm}$, which indicates the itinerant nature of the long-range
magnetic order. Comparison of the hole-doped BaK122 with electron-doped
Ba(Fe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$)$_2$As$_2$ (FeCo122) with similar $T_{sm}\sim$110~K,

spatially infinite. I review this well-known paradox, and consider a popular
solution where the symmetry is explicitly broken by some external field which
goes to zero in the infinite-volume limit; although this is formally
satisfactory, I argue that it must be rejected as a physical explanation of SSB
since it fails to reproduce some important features of the phenomenology.
Motivated by considerations from the analogous classical system, I argue that
SSB in finite systems should be understood in terms of the approximate
decoupling of the system's state space into dynamically-isolated sectors,
related by a symmetry transformation; I use the formalism of decoherent
histories to make this more precise and to quantify the effect, showing that it
is more than sufficient to explain SSB in realistic systems and that it goes
over in a smooth and natural way to the infinite limit.

estimation of an unknown quantity, such as a volume or an image, can be greatly
enhanced, compared to maximum-likelihood techniques, by incorporating a prior
model on the quantity to reconstruct. A complex prior can be designed for
multi-channel estimation such as reconstruction and segmentation thanks to
Gauss-Markov-Potts prior model. For very large inverse problems such as 3D
X-ray CT, maximization a posteriori (MAP) techniques are often used due to the
huge size of the data and the unknown. Nevertheless, MAP estimation does not
enable to have quantify uncertainties on the retrieved reconstruction, which
can be useful for post-reconstruction processes for instance in industry and
medicine. A way to tackle the problem of uncertainties estimation is to compute
posterior mean (PM) for which the uncertainties are the variances of the
posterior distribution. Because MCMC methods are not affordable for very large
3D problems, this paper presents an algorithm to jointly estimate the
reconstruction and the uncertainties by computing PM thanks to variational
Bayesian approach (VBA). The prior model we consider for the unknowns is a
Gauss-Markov-Potts prior which has been shown to give good results in many
inverse problems. After having detailed the used prior models, the algorithm
based on VBA is detailed : it corresponds to an iterative computation
ofapproximate distributions through the iterative updates of their parameters.
The updating formulae are given in the last section. We also provide a method
for initialization of the algorithm, as a method to fix each parameter.
Perspectives are applications of this algorithm to large 3D problems such as 3D

clear that the origin of complicated patterns of the HHG spectra in

equipped with a random number generator switching heating/cooling on or off

diversity is modeled through inhomogeneity/disorder in the deterministic
dynamics of loads. Approached from the standpoint of statistical physics, the
ensemble represents a non-equilibrium system driven away from its natural
steady state by the DR. The ability of the ensemble to recover by mixing faster
to the steady state after its DR's use is advantageous. The trade-off between
the level of the aggregator's control, commanding the devices to lower the rate
$r$, and the phase-space-oscillatory deterministic dynamics is analyzed. We
discover that there exists a critical value, $r_c$, corresponding to both the
most efficient mixing and the bifurcation point where the ensemble transitions
from the oscillatory relaxation at $r>r_c$ to the pure relaxation at $r<r_c$.
Then, we study the effect of the load diversity, investigating four different
disorder probability distributions (DPDs) ranging from the case of the Gaussian
DPD to the case of the uniform with finite support DPD. Demonstrating
resemblance to the similar question of the effectiveness of Landau damping in

computational tool for data driven Koopman spectral analysis by taking up the
formidable challenge to develop a numerically robust algorithm by following the
natural formulation via the Krylov decomposition with the Frobenius companion
matrix, and by using its eigenvectors explicitly -- these are defined as the
inverse of the notoriously ill-conditioned Vandermonde matrix. The key step to
curb ill-conditioning is the discrete Fourier transform of the snapshots; in
the new representation, the Vandermonde matrix is transformed into a
generalized Cauchy matrix, which then allows accurate computation by specially
tailored algorithms of numerical linear algebra. The second goal is to shed
light on the connection between the formulas for optimal reconstruction weights
when reconstructing snapshots using subsets of the computed Koopman modes. It
is shown how using a certain weaker form of generalized inverses leads to
explicit reconstruction formulas that match the abstract results from Koopman

simulations of G and K-type stars for the spectral lines Ca II K at 3933 \AA,
Na I 5890 \AA, H I 6563 \AA\ (H$\alpha$), and He I 10830 \AA. We find that
strong facular emission and large coverage fractions can contribute a
non-negligible amount to transmission spectra, especially for H$\alpha$, Ca II
K, and Na I D, while spots and filaments are comparatively unimportant. The
amount of contamination depends strongly on the location of the active regions
and the intrinsic emission strength. In particular, active regions must be
concentrated along the transit chord in order to produce a consistent
in-transit signal. Mean absorption signatures in Na I and H$\alpha$ for
example, can reach $\approx 0.2\%$ and $0.3\%$, respectively, for transits of
active latitudes with line emission similar in strength to moderate solar
flares. Transmission spectra of planets transiting active stars, such as HD
189733, are likely contaminated by the contrast effect, although the tight
constraints on active region geometry and emission strength make it unlikely
that consistent in-transit signatures are due entirely to the contrast effect.
He I 10830 \AA\ is not strongly affected and absorption signatures are likely
diluted, rather than enhanced, by stellar activity. He I 10830 \AA\ should thus
be considered a priority for probing extended atmospheres, even in the case of

We compiled a sample of 29 group environments consisting of 74 galaxies (2-5

equivalent width ($\langle W_r(2796)\rangle=0.65\pm0.13$ {\AA}) and covering

analysis shows that group environment kinematics are statistically comparable

dispersions similar to outflow kinematics. Group absorbers display more optical
depth at larger velocities. A superposition model in which multiple galaxies
contribute to the observed gas matches larger equivalent width group absorbers,

local objective function is private and only known to an individual agent. To
cooperatively solve the problem, most existing decentralized optimization
approaches require participating agents to exchange and disclose estimates to
neighboring agents. However, this results in leakage of private information
about local objective functions, which is undesirable when adversaries exist
and try to steal information from participating agents. To address this issue,
we propose a privacy-preserving decentralized optimization approach based on
proximal Jacobian ADMM via function decomposition. Numerical simulations
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Automatically recognizing human bodily expression in unconstrained situations,
however, is daunting given the incomplete understanding of the relationship
between emotional expressions and body movements. The current research, as a
multidisciplinary effort among computer and information sciences, psychology,
and statistics, proposes a scalable and reliable crowdsourcing approach for
collecting in-the-wild perceived emotion data for computers to learn to
recognize body languages of humans. To accomplish this task, a large and
growing annotated dataset with 9,876 video clips of body movements and 13,239
human characters, named BoLD (Body Language Dataset), has been created.
Comprehensive statistical analysis of the dataset revealed many interesting
insights. A system to model the emotional expressions based on bodily
movements, named ARBEE (Automated Recognition of Bodily Expression of Emotion),
has also been developed and evaluated. Our analysis shows the effectiveness of
Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) features in characterizing arousal, and our
experiments using LMA features further demonstrate computability of bodily
expression. We report and compare results of several other baseline methods
which were developed for action recognition based on two different modalities,
body skeleton, and raw image. The dataset and findings presented in this work
will likely serve as a launchpad for future discoveries in body language
understanding that will enable future robots to interact and collaborate more

reducing the problem dimensions from 3 to 2. The unknown field T(x,r,t) can be

the problem into two separate stages of finding the similarity matrix and

we estimate the reliability of the cluster assignment for each point before
assigning a point to a subspace. We group the data points into two groups of
""certain"" and ""uncertain"", with the assignment of latter group delayed until
their subspace association certainty improves. (ii) We demonstrate that delayed
association is better suited for clustering subspaces that have ambiguities,
i.e. when subspaces intersect or data are contaminated with outliers/noise.

leads to a more accurate self-representation and final clusters. The proposed

modulating the thermal emission from these objects, based on: 1) the lack of a
clear trend in phase offsets with equilibrium temperature, 2) the sharp
day-night transitions required to have non-negative intensity maps, which also
resolves the inversion issues raised by Keating & Cowan (2017), 3) the fact
that all the nightsides of these objects appear to be at roughly the same
temperature of 1000K, while the dayside temperatures increase linearly with
equilibrium temperature, and 4) the trajectories of these objects on a Spitzer

select variable AGN by assessing whether detected variability is well-described
by a damped random walk model. We find 135 galaxies with AGN-like nuclear
variability. While most of the variability-selected AGNs have narrow emission
lines consistent with the presence of an AGN, a small fraction have narrow
emission lines dominated by star formation. The star-forming systems with
nuclear AGN-like variability tend to be low-mass
($M_{\ast}<10^{10}~M_{\odot}$), and may be AGNs missed by other selection
techniques due to star formation dilution or low-metallicities. We explore the
AGN fraction as a function of stellar mass, and find that the fraction of
variable AGN increases with stellar mass, even after taking into account the
fact that lower mass systems are fainter. There are several possible
explanations for an observed decline in the fraction of variable AGN with
decreasing stellar mass, including a drop in the supermassive black hole
occupation fraction, a decrease in the ratio of black hole mass to galaxy
stellar mass, or a change in the variability properties of lower-mass AGNs. We
demonstrate that optical photometric variability is a promising avenue for
detecting AGNs in low-mass, star formation-dominated galaxies, which has

arrangement, and the resulting turbulent interactions with the atmospheric
boundary layer. The main goal of this work is to study the effect of turbine
layout on the power output for large wind farms approaching a fully-developed
regime. For this purpose we employ an experimental setup of a scaled wind farm
with one-hundred porous disk models, of which sixty are instrumented with
strain gages. Our experiments cover a parametric space of fifty-six different
layouts for which the turbine-area-density is constant, focusing on different
turbine arrangements including non-uniform spacings. The strain-gage
measurements are used to deduce surrogate power and unsteady loading on
turbines for each layout. Our results indicate that the power asymptote at the
end of the wind farm depends on the layout in different ways. Firstly, for
layouts with a relatively uniform spacing we find that the power asymptote in
the fully developed regime reaches approximately the same value, similarly to
the prediction of available analytical models. Secondly, we show that the power
asymptote in the fully-developed regime can be lowered by inefficient turbine
placement, for instance when a large number of the turbines are located in the
near wake of upstream turbines. Thirdly, our experiments indicate that an
uneven spacing between turbines can improve the overall power output for both
the developing and fully-developed part of large wind farms. Specifically, we
find a higher power asymptote for a turbine layout with a significant
streamwise uneven spacing (i.e. a large streamwise spacing between pairs of
closely spaced rows that are slightly staggered). Our results thereby indicate
that such a layout may promote beneficial flow interactions in the
fully-developed regime for conditions with a strongly prevailing wind
direction.

also discuss their computational and communicational constraints. We
investigate feasible (non)linear models that will minimize energy and maximize
memory, efficiency, and computational power, and also provide an approximate
solution obtained within a pre-determined length of computation time using
limited resources so that an optimal solution to a language could be

stars at ~1000 times higher rate than the Milky Way. A large fraction of stars
is formed in the central 1 kiloparsec region, that is comparable in size to
massive, quiescent galaxies found at the peak of the cosmic star formation
history, and eventually the core of giant elliptical galaxies in the
present-day Universe. However, the physical and kinematic properties inside a
compact starburst core are poorly understood because dissecting it requires
angular resolution even higher than the Hubble Space Telescope can offer. Here
we report 550 parsec-resolution observations of gas and dust in the brightest
unlensed submillimeter galaxy at z=4.3. We map out for the first time the
spatial and kinematic structure of molecular gas inside the heavily
dust-obscured core. The gas distribution is clumpy while the underlying disk is
rotation-supported. Exploiting the high-quality map of molecular gas mass
surface density, we find a strong evidence that the starburst disk is
gravitationally unstable, implying that the self-gravity of gas overcomes the
differential rotation and the internal pressure by stellar radiation feedback.
The observed molecular gas would be consumed by star formation in a timescale
of 100 million years, that is comparable to those in merging starburst
galaxies. Our results suggest that the most extreme starburst in the early
Universe originates from efficient star formation due to a gravitational
instability in the central 2 kpc region.

for Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between time series. These have many
applications in time series indexing, clustering, forecasting, regression and
classification. One of the key time series classification algorithms, the
nearest neighbor algorithm with DTW distance (NN-DTW) is very expensive to
compute, due to the quadratic complexity of DTW. Lower bound search can speed
up NN-DTW substantially. An effective and tight lower bound quickly prunes off
unpromising nearest neighbor candidates from the search space and minimises the
number of the costly DTW computations. The speed up provided by lower bound
search becomes increasingly critical as training set size increases. Different
lower bounds provide different trade-offs between computation time and
tightness. Most existing lower bounds interact with DTW warping window sizes.
They are very tight and effective at smaller warping window sizes, but become
looser as the warping window increases, thus reducing the pruning effectiveness
for NN-DTW. In this work, we present a new class of lower bounds that are
tighter than the popular Keogh lower bound, while requiring similar computation
time. Our new lower bounds take advantage of the DTW boundary condition,
monotonicity and continuity constraints to create a tighter lower bound. Of
particular significance, they remain relatively tight even for large windows. A
single parameter to these new lower bounds controls the speed-tightness
trade-off. We demonstrate that these new lower bounds provide an exceptional
balance between computation time and tightness for the NN-DTW time series
classification task, resulting in greatly improved efficiency for NN-DTW lower
bound search.

Unexpectedly, the corner frequency of the observed Lorentzian peaks shows
strong sensitivity to the applied source - drain bias. This dependence on
electric field can be explained by the Frenkel-Poole effect in the scenario
where the voltage drop happens predominantly on the defects, which block the
quasi-1D conduction channels. We also have found that the activation energy of
the characteristic frequencies of the G-R noise in quasi-1D ZrTe3 is defined

excitation of oscillations, especially in cool $\delta$ Scuti and $\gamma$
Doradus stars and all cool Cepheid- and Mira-like stars. Turbulent thermal
convection, on the other hand, is a damping mechanism against oscillations that
actually plays the major role in giving rise to the red edge of the instability
strip. Our study shows that oscillations of $\delta$ Scuti and $\gamma$ Doradus

between convection and oscillations, and they belong to the same class of

Higher-lying magnetically open structures, observed in AIA 171 A images above
the solar limb, move downward and interact with the lower-lying closed loops,
resulting in the formation of dips in the former. An X-type structure forms at
the interface. The interacting loops reconnect and disappear. Two sets of
newly-reconnected loops then form and recede from the MR region. During the MR
process, bright emission appears sequentially in the AIA 131 A and 304 A
channels repeatedly in the dips of higher-lying open structures. This indicates
the cooling and condensation process of hotter plasma from ~0.9 MK down to ~0.6
MK, and then to ~0.05 MK, also supported by the light curves of the AIA 171 A,
131 A, and 304 A channels. The part of higher-lying open structures supporting
the condensations participate in the successive MR. The condensations without
support by underlying loops then rain back to the solar surface along the
newly-reconnected loops. Our results suggest that the MR between coronal loops
leads to the condensation of hotter coronal plasma and its downflows. MR thus
plays an active role in the mass cycle of coronal plasma because it can
initiate the catastrophic cooling and condensation. This underlines that the

relativistic electrons emitting through inverse Compton scattering. In
particular, the GeV emission detected from Cygnus X-3, and its orbital phase
dependence, strongly suggest that the emitting electrons are accelerated in a
relativistic jet, and that the optical companion provides the dominant target.
Here, we study the effects related to particle transport in the framework of
the relativistic jet scenario. We find that even in the most compact binary
systems, with parameters similar to Cygnus X-3, particle transport can have a
substantial influence on the GeV lightcurve unless the jet is slow, $\beta <
0.7$. In more extended binary systems, strong impact of particle transport is
nearly unavoidable. Thus, even for a very compact system such as Cygnus X-3,
particle transport significantly affects the ability of one-zone models to
infer the properties of the gamma-ray production site based on the shape on the

curved spacetimes, despite the vanishing of the trace of the conformally
invariant classical stress-energy tensor, was firmly established in the 1970's,
and expressions for the anomalous trace of the semi-classical quantum
stress-energy tensor constructed from the curvature tensors of the background
spacetime were proven to hold independent of the quantum state of the field.
Subsequently, effective actions were devised whose variation with respect to
the metric gives a conserved ""anomalous stress-energy tensor"" or ASET. These
ASETs, sometimes together with a contribution from a conformally invariant
contribution to the effective action, were used to derive approximations to the
full semi-classical stress-energy tensor (SCSET), which is state dependent. I
argue that the ASET should be defined as state independent, and for a
Schwarzschild black hole spacetime should be regular on the horizon and should
fall off at infinity fast enough to be consistent with asymptotic flatness.
Proposals for anomaly effective actions discussed in the literature are
unsatisfactory in this regard, but I show that it is possible to meet these
criteria. The ASET is evaluated and compared with numerical results for the
full SCSET.

turns out to be a partial hyper-singular integro-differential operator. This is
due to the fact that the related differential cross-sections
$\sigma(x,\omega',\omega,E',E)$ may have hyper-singularities. In these cases
the energy integral appearing in the collision terms must be interpreted as the
Hadamard finite part integral leading to hyper-singular integral operators. The
article considers a refined expression for the exact transport operator and
related variational formulations of the inflow initial boundary value problem
for one particle equation containing hyper-singularities. We find that the
exact BTE contains the first-order partial derivatives with respect to energy
combined by partial Hadamard (first-order) singular integral operators. In
addition, it contains the second-order partial derivatives with respect to
angle and some mixed terms. The analysis will be carried out only for the so
called M{\o}ller-type interaction (scattering) which is a kind of prototype of
hyper-singular interactions. The generalizations to other type of collisions,
such as to Bremsstrahlung, go analogously. We also expose a weak form (the
variational formulation) of the hyper-singular transport problem. Another
variant variational formulation decreases the level of singularities in the
integration (appearing in the due bilinear form) containing only singularities
of order one that is, singularities like ${1\over{E'-E}}dE' dE$. The
variational formulation is an essential step in order to show the existence of
generalized solutions e.g. by Lions-Lax-Milgram Theorem based methods
(proceedings for solution spaces and existence theory are omitted here). The
corresponding approximative transport operator is deduced. It turns out to be a

coronagraph, and suite of spectrometers and imagers - this concept underlies
planned instruments for both TMT (the Planetary Systems Imager, or PSI) and the
GMT (GMagAO-X). These instruments could provide astrometry, photometry, and
spectroscopy of an unprecedented sample of rocky planets, ice giants, and gas
giants. For the first time habitable zone exoplanets will become accessible to
direct imaging, and these instruments have the potential to detect and
characterize the innermost regions of nearby M-dwarf planetary systems in
reflected light. High-resolution spectroscopy will not only illuminate the
physics and chemistry of exo-atmospheres, but may also probe rocky, temperate
worlds for signs of life in the form of atmospheric biomarkers (combinations of
water, oxygen and other molecular species). By completing the census of
non-transiting worlds at a range of separations from their host stars, these
instruments will provide the final pieces to the puzzle of planetary
demographics. This whitepaper explores the science goals of direct imaging on
30-m telescopes and the technology development needed to achieve them.

knowledge and truth. They were introduced by Belnap in 1977 in a paper entitled
\emph{How a computer should think}. Belnap argued that instead of using a logic
with two values, for `true' ($t$) and `false' ($f$), a computer should use a
logic with two further values, for `contradiction' ($\top$) and `no
information' ($\bot$). The resulting structure is equipped with two lattice
orders, a \emph{knowledge order} and a \emph{truth order}, and hence is called
a \emph{bilattice}.
  Prioritised default bilattices include not only values for `true' ($t_0$),
`false' ($f_0$), `contradiction' and `no information', but also indexed
families of default values, $t_1, \dots, t_n$ and $f_1, \dots, f_n$, for
simultaneous modelling of degrees of knowledge and truth.
  We focus on a new family of prioritised default bilattices: $\mathbf J_n$,
for $n \in \omega$. The bilattice $\mathbf J_0$ is precisely Belnap's seminal
example. We address mathematical rather than logical aspects of our prioritised
default bilattices. We obtain a single-sorted topological representation for
the bilattices in the quasivariety $\mathcal J_n$ generated by $\mathbf J_n$,
and separately a multi-sorted topological representation for the bilattices in
the variety $\mathcal V_n$ generated by $\mathbf J_n$. Our results provide an
interesting example where the multi-sorted duality for the variety has a
simpler structure than the single-sorted duality for the quasivariety.

plasma potential near the anode decreases during the transition from ion sheath
to electron sheath. The plasma potential locks to the ionization potential of
argon gas when anode spot is completely formed. A systematic study showed that
during the transition, the electron temperature increases and plasma density
decreases in the bulk plasma. The spectroscopy of the discharge showed presence
of strong atomic and ionic lines of argon. The intensity of these spectral
lines showed a dip during the transition between two sheaths. After the
formation of the anode spot, oscillations of the order of 5-20 kHz are observed
in the discharge current and floating potential due to the enhanced ionisation
and excitation processes in the electron sheath.

algebra, invariant theory, combinatorics and algebraic complexity; and a
further generalization (tensor scaling) has found more applications in quantum
information theory, geometric complexity theory and invariant theory. In this
survey, we will describe in detail the scaling problems mentioned above,
showing how alternating minimization algorithms naturally arise in this
setting, and we shall present a general framework to rigorously analyze such
algorithms. These simple problems and algorithms are not just applicable to
diverse mathematical and CS areas, but also serve to bring out deep connections
between them. As this framework makes extensive use of concepts from invariant
theory, we also provide a very gentle introduction to basic concepts of
invariant theory and how they are used to analyze alternating minimization
algorithms for the scaling problems. This survey is intended for a general
computer science audience, and the only background required is basic knowledge
of calculus and linear algebra, thereby making it accessible to graduate
students and even to advanced undergraduates.

learners to produce a complex and accurate model. From an optimization point of
view, the learning procedure of gradient boosting mimics a gradient descent on
a functional variable. This paper proposes to build upon the proximal point
algorithm, when the empirical risk to minimize is not differentiable, in order
to introduce a novel boosting approach, called proximal boosting. It comes with
a companion algorithm inspired by [1] and called residual proximal boosting,
which is aimed at better controlling the approximation error. Theoretical
convergence is proved for these two procedures under different hypotheses on
the empirical risk and advantages of leveraging proximal methods for boosting
are illustrated by numerical experiments on simulated and real-world data. In
particular, we exhibit a favorable comparison over gradient boosting regarding
convergence rate and prediction accuracy.

  We find (i) that one can distinguish regions in the large-scale cluster wind

quantitative image features into survival prediction. So far, this kind of
analysis is mostly based on radiomics features, i.e. a fixed set of features

convolutional neural networks. However, for tomographic medical images, model
training is difficult because on the one hand, only few samples of 3D image
data fit into one batch at once and on the other hand, survival loss functions
are essentially ordering measures that require large batch sizes. In this work,
we show that by simplifying survival analysis to median survival
classification, convolutional neural networks can be trained with small batch
sizes and learn features that predict survival equally well as end-to-end
hazard prediction networks. Our approach outperforms the previous state of the

finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$, motivated by the fact that such limit theories
can be naturally interpreted in classical Quantum Theory. In this letter, we
first make a number of rectifications of statements made in [2]. For instance,
we show that Quantum Theory over $\mathbb{F}_1$ {\em does} have a natural
analogon of an inner product, and so orthogonality is a well-defined notion,
contrary to what is claimed in [2]. Starting from that formalism, we introduce
time evolution operators and observables in Quantum $\mathbb{F}_{un}$, and we
determine the corresponding unitary group. Next, we obtain a typical no-cloning
in the general realm of Quantum $\mathbb{F}_{un}$. Finally, we obtain a
no-deletion result as well. Remarkably, we show that we {\em can} perform
quantum deletion by {\em almost unitary operators}, with a probability tending
to $1$. Although we develop the construction in Quantum $\mathbb{F}_{un}$, it
is also valid in any other Quantum Theory (and thus also in classical Quantum
Theory).

brought up only in 2006 and has been intensively studied ever since. One of the
main contributions of this paper is the maximal asymmetry function for a family
of copulas. We compute this function for the major families of shock-based
copulas, i.e. Marshall, maxmin and reflected maxmin (RMM for short) copulas and
also for some other important families. We compute the sharp bound of asymmetry
measure $\mu_\infty$, the most important of the asymmetry measures, for the
family of Marshall copulas and the family of maxmin copulas, which both equal
to $\frac{4}{27}\ (\approx 0.148)$. One should compare this bound to the one
for the class of PQD copulas to which they belong, which is $3-2\sqrt{2}\
\approx 0.172)$, and to the general bound for all copulas that is $\frac13$.
Furthermore, we give the sharp bound of the same asymmetry measure for RMM
copulas which is $3-2\sqrt{2}$, compared to the same bound for NQD copulas,
where they belong, which is $\sqrt{5}-2\ (\approx 0.236)$. One of our main
results is also the statistical interpretation of shocks in a given model at
which the maximal asymmetry measure bound is attained. These interpretations
for the three families studied are illustrated by examples that should be

observed in different samples, both as-grown and microscopic samples processed

present in the as-grown crystal is inhomogeneous yet exists in the bulk. For
samples fabricated with FIB, we observe, in addition to the bulk
superconductivity, a second superconducting state that resides on the sample
surface. Through measurements of the characteristic fields as a function of
temperature and angle, we are able to confirm the dimensionality of the two

species, appreciably mixing with the active neutrinos, is disfavored by
different cosmological observations like Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) and Large Scale Structure (LSS). Recently, it was
shown that the presence of additional interactions in the sterile neutrino
sector via light bosonic mediators can make the scenario cosmologically viable
by suppressing the production of the sterile neutrinos from active neutrinos
via matter-like effect caused by the mediator. This mechanism works assuming
the initial population of this sterile sector to be negligible with respect to
that of the Standard Model (SM) particles, before the production from active
neutrinos. However, there is fair chance that such bosonic mediators may couple
to the inflaton and can be copiously produced during (p)reheating epoch.
Consequently, they may ruin this assumption of initial small density of the
sterile sector. In this article we, starting from inflation, investigate the
production of such a sterile sector during (p)reheating in a large field
inflationary scenario and identify the parameter region that allows for a
viable early Universe cosmology.

partition function of quantum spin systems, in which the imaginary-time
dependence of the partition function occurs inevitably. Since it is very
difficult to explicitly treat the imaginary-time dependence of the partition
function, we usually neglect the imaginary-time dynamical effect, which is
called the static approximation. Although the static approximation is the first
approach, it is not even clear when the static approximation is justified for
mean-field quantum spin systems, that is, mean-field quantum spin systems have
not been solved exactly so far. In this study, we solve exactly the partition
function for a particular class of mean-field quantum spin systems including
randomness without the static approximation. The partition function can be
regarded as a result of time evolution in the imaginary-time Schr\""odinger
equation, and solving the exact solution of the partition function is
equivalent to solving the optimal control problem in the imaginary-time
Schr\""odinger equation. As the result, the solution of the optimal control
problem coincides exactly with the static approximate solution of the partition
function and, therefore, the static approximation is exact for the particular
class of mean-field quantum spin systems including randomness in general.
Furthermore, we prove that the analysis of the previous study in quantum
annealing is exact where the non-stoquastic interaction and the inhomogeneous
transverse field accelerate the computational time exponentially for mean-field
quantum spin systems.

is whether it is hydrophobic or hydrophilic. The traditional classification is
based on chemical experience and heuristics. However, this does not reveal how
the local environment modulates this important property. We present a local
fingerprint for hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity inspired by the two body
contribution to the entropy. This fingerprint is an inexpensive, quantitative
and physically meaningful way of studying hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity
that only requires as input the water-solute radial distribution functions. We
apply our fingerprint to octanol, benzene and the 20 proteinogenic amino acids.
Our measure of hydrophilicity is coherent with chemical experience and,
moreover, it also shows how the character of an atom can change as its
environment is changed. Lastly, we use the fingerprint as collective variable
in a funnel metadynamics simulation of a host-guest system. The fingerprint
serves as a desolvation collective variable that enhances transitions between
the bound and unbound states.

Probably no theoretical study on this subject has been done in the last three
decades. For the calculation, we have derived a framework from the usual
$\beta^{-}$ decay theory used by previous authors. Dependence of the calculated
rates on the nuclear radius and neutral atom Q-value have been examined. We
have used the latest experimental data for nuclear and atomic observables, such
as $\beta^{-}$ decay Q-value, ionization energy, neutral atom $\beta^{-}$ decay
branchings, neutral atom half-lives etc. Results of $\beta^{-}$ decay rates for
decay to continuum and bound states and the enhancement factor due to the bound
state decay for a number of nuclei have been tabulated and compared with the
previously calculated values, if available. The effective rate or half-life
calculated for bare atom might be helpful to set a limit for the maximum
enhancement due to bound state decay. Finally, $\beta^{-}$ decay branching for
bare atom has been calculated. The changes in branching in bare atom compared
to that in the neutral atom and for the first time branching flip for a few

in terms of Q-values of the transitions in the neutral and bare atoms.
Verification of this branching change / flip phenomenon in bare atom decay

all prior studies of reading difficulty are designed for native speakers,
rather than non-native readers. In this study, we investigate various features
for ESL readers, by conducting a linear regression to estimate the reading
level of English language sources. This estimation is based not only on the
complexity of lexical and syntactic features, but also several novel concepts,
including the age of word and grammar acquisition from several sources, word
sense from WordNet, and the implicit relation between sentences. By employing
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select the optimal model, we find that
the combination of the number of words, the age of word acquisition and the
height of the parsing tree generate better results than alternative competing
models. Thus, our results show that proposed second language reading difficulty
estimation outperforms other first language reading difficulty estimations.

has increasingly focused on computer aided question generation. However, this
approach often provides test takers with an exhaustive amount of questions that
are not designed for any specific testing purpose. In this work, we present a
personalized computer aided question generation that generates multiple choice
questions at various difficulty levels and types, including vocabulary, grammar
and reading comprehension. In order to improve the weaknesses of test takers,
it selects questions depending on an estimated proficiency level and unclear
concepts behind incorrect responses. This results show that the students with
the personalized automatic quiz generation corrected their mistakes more
frequently than ones only with computer aided question generation. Moreover,
students demonstrated the most progress between the pretest and post test and
correctly answered more difficult questions. Finally, we investigated the
personalizing strategy and found that a student could make a significant
progress if the proposed system offered the vocabulary questions at the same
level of his or her proficiency level, and if the grammar and reading
comprehension questions were at a level lower than his or her proficiency

hyperspectral image classification with a limited amount of labeled samples in

learning (CDCL), which is addressed via cluster canonical correlation analysis
(C-CCA) and random walker (RW) algorithms. To be specific, the proposed CDCL
method is an iterative process of three main stages, i.e. twice of RW-based
pseudolabeling and cross domain learning via C-CCA. Firstly, given the
initially labeled target samples as training set ($\mathbf{TS}$), the RW-based
pseudolabeling is employed to update $\mathbf{TS}$ and extract target clusters
($\mathbf{TCs}$) by fusing the segmentation results obtained by RW and extended
RW (ERW) classifiers. Secondly, cross domain learning via C-CCA is applied
using labeled source samples and $\mathbf{TCs}$. The unlabeled target samples
are then classified with the estimated probability maps using the model trained
in the projected correlation subspace. Thirdly, both $\mathbf{TS}$ and
estimated probability maps are used for updating $\mathbf{TS}$ again via
RW-based pseudolabeling. When the iterative process finishes, the result
obtained by the ERW classifier using the final $\mathbf{TS}$ and estimated
probability maps is regarded as the final classification map. Experimental
results on four real HSIs demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve
better performance compared with the state-of-the-art HDA and ERW methods.

effective-one-body approach and numerical-relativity simulations as signals

appreciable measurement biases in masses and spin for typical observations
(small tidal deformability and signal-to-noise ratio $\sim$ 25). However, with
increasing signal-to-noise ratio or tidal deformability there are biases in the

which combine a general-purpose host processor with a many-core accelerator,
both for programmability and to avoid data duplication. However, SVM can bring
a significant run time overhead when translation lookaside buffer (TLB) entries
are missing. Moreover, allowing DMA burst transfers to write SVM traditionally
requires buffers to absorb transfers that miss in the TLB. These buffers have
to be overprovisioned for the maximum burst size, wasting precious on-chip
memory, and stall all SVM accesses once they are full, hampering the
scalability of parallel accelerators.
  In this work, we present our SVM solution that avoids the majority of TLB
misses with prefetching, supports parallel burst DMA transfers without
additional buffers, and can be scaled with the workload and number of parallel
processors. Our solution is based on three novel concepts: To minimize the rate
of TLB misses, the TLB is proactively filled by compiler-generated Prefetching
Helper Threads, which use run-time information to issue timely prefetches. To
reduce the latency of TLB misses, misses are handled by a variable number of
parallel Miss Handling Helper Threads. To support parallel burst DMA transfers
to SVM without additional buffers, we add lightweight hardware to a standard

  in the proceedings of the 12th International Symposium on Empirical Software
  Engineering and Measurement, 2018",,,,"cs.SE cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  BACKGROUND: Vulnerable dependencies are a known problem in today's
open-source software ecosystems because OSS libraries are highly interconnected
and developers do not always update their dependencies. AIMS: In this paper we
aim to present a precise methodology, that combines the code-based analysis of
patches with information on build, test, update dates, and group extracted from
the very code repository, and therefore, caters to the needs of industrial
practice for correct allocation of development and audit resources. METHOD: To
understand the industrial impact of the proposed methodology, we considered the
200 most popular OSS Java libraries used by SAP in its own software. Our
analysis included 10905 distinct GAVs (group, artifact, version) when
considering all the library versions. RESULTS: We found that about 20% of the
dependencies affected by a known vulnerability are not deployed, and therefore,
they do not represent a danger to the analyzed library because they cannot be
exploited in practice. Developers of the analyzed libraries are able to fix
(and actually responsible for) 82% of the deployed vulnerable dependencies. The
vast majority (81%) of vulnerable dependencies may be fixed by simply updating
to a new version, while 1% of the vulnerable dependencies in our sample are
halted, and therefore, potentially require a costly mitigation strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our case study shows that the correct counting allows software
development companies to receive actionable information about their library
dependencies, and therefore, correctly allocate costly development and audit
resources, which is spent inefficiently in case of distorted measurements.

understanding of fundamental particles and the forces that govern their
interactions. In order to increase the energy or reduce the size of the
accelerator, new acceleration schemes need to be developed. Plasma wakefield
acceleration, in which the electrons in a plasma are excited, leading to strong
electric fields, is one such promising novel acceleration technique. Pioneering
experiments have shown that an intense laser pulse or electron bunch traversing
a plasma, drives electric fields of 10s GV/m and above. These values are well
beyond those achieved in conventional RF accelerators which are limited to ~0.1
GV/m. A limitation of laser pulses and electron bunches is their low stored
energy, which motivates the use of multiple stages to reach very high energies.
The use of proton bunches is compelling, as they have the potential to drive
wakefields and accelerate electrons to high energy in a single accelerating
stage. The long proton bunches currently available can be used, as they undergo
self-modulation, a particle-plasma interaction which longitudinally splits the
bunch into a series of high density microbunches, which then act resonantly to
create large wakefields. The AWAKE experiment at CERN uses intense bunches of
protons, each of energy 400 GeV, with a total bunch energy of 19 kJ, to drive a
wakefield in a 10 m long plasma. Bunches of electrons are injected into the
wakefield formed by the proton microbunches. This paper presents measurements
of electrons accelerated up to 2 GeV at AWAKE. This constitutes the first
demonstration of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. The potential for
this scheme to produce very high energy electron bunches in a single
accelerating stage means that the results shown here are a significant step
towards the development of future high energy particle accelerators.

verified for examples consisting of up to 4 vortices, we show that the linear
stability of the induced solutions is solely determined by the type of the

are stable in a certain linear sense. The proof uses a criterion for the

nonperturbative analysis is needed to settle the question of phase transitions
for compact groups, the results may also indicate the necessity to consider

for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. To be specific, HSIs in both
domains are first segmented into superpixels and tensors of both domains are
constructed to include neighboring samples from single superpixel. Then we
consider the subspace invariance between two domains as projection matrices and
original tensors are projected as core tensors with lower dimensions into the
invariant tensor subspace by applying Tucker decomposition. To preserve
geometric information in original tensors, we employ a manifold regularization
term for core tensors into the decomposition progress. The projection matrices
and core tensors are solved in an alternating optimization manner and the
convergence of TA algorithm is analyzed. In addition, a post-processing
strategy is defined via pure samples extraction for each superpixel to further
improve classification performance. Experimental results on four real HSIs
demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better performance compared
with the state-of-the-art subspace learning methods when a limited amount of
source labeled samples are available.

when the string fusion processes are taken into account and a formation of
strings of a few different types takes place in a collision, this observable is
proved to be equal to a weighted average of its values for different string

cohesive energy, lattice constant and bulk modulus as representatives for the

and various bonding characters. A strong effort is made to push the borders of
numerical accuracy for cohesive properties as calculated using the
local-density approximation (LDA), several generalized gradient approximations
(GGAs), meta-GGAs and hybrids in \textit{all-electron} resolution, and the
second-order M\o{}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and the random-phase

\textit{all-electron} Hartree-Fock, PBE and/or PBE0 references. This results in
over 10,000 calculations, which record a comprehensive convergence test with

paved the way for a new variant of pervasive computing. In PS, human user
performs sensing tasks and generates notifications, typically in lieu of
incentives. These notifications are real-time, large-volume, and multi-modal,
which are eventually fused by the PS platform to generate a summary. One major
limitation with PS is the sparsity of notifications owing to lack of active
participation, thus inhibiting large scale real-life experiments for the
research community. On the flip side, research community always needs ground
truth to validate the efficacy of the proposed models and algorithms. Most of
the PS applications involve human mobility and report generation following
sensing of any event of interest in the adjacent environment. This work is an
attempt to study and empirically model human participation behavior and event
occurrence distributions through development of a location-sensitive data
simulation framework, called PS-Sim. From extensive experiments it has been
observed that the synthetic data generated by PS-Sim replicates real
participation and event occurrence behaviors in PS applications, which may be
considered for validation purpose in absence of the groundtruth. As a
proof-of-concept, we have used real-life dataset from a vehicular traffic
management application to train the models in PS-Sim and cross-validated the
simulated data with other parts of the same dataset.

to confirm that, as might be expected, approximation allows the agent to trade
off between learning speed and quality of the learned policy. Next, we show how
a given density model can be related to an abstraction and that the
corresponding pseudo-count bonus can act as a substitute in MBIE-EB combined
with this abstraction, but may lead to either under- or over-exploration. Then,

movements) help to better understand the speech in noise. Lip-reading driven
speech enhancement significantly outperforms benchmark audio-only approaches at
low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, at high SNRs or low levels of
background noise, visual cues become fairly less effective for speech
enhancement. Therefore, a more optimal, context-aware audio-visual (AV) system
is required, that contextually utilises both visual and noisy audio features
and effectively accounts for different noisy conditions. In this paper, we
introduce a novel contextual AV switching component that contextually exploits
AV cues with respect to different operating conditions to estimate clean audio,
without requiring any SNR estimation. The switching module switches between
visual-only (V-only), audio-only (A-only), and both AV cues at low, high and
moderate SNR levels, respectively. The contextual AV switching component is
developed by integrating a convolutional neural network and long-short-term
memory network. For testing, the estimated clean audio features are utilised by
the developed novel enhanced visually derived Wiener filter for clean audio
power spectrum estimation. The contextual AV speech enhancement method is
evaluated under real-world scenarios using benchmark Grid and ChiME3 corpora.
For objective testing, perceptual evaluation of speech quality is used to
evaluate the quality of the restored speech. For subjective testing, the
standard mean-opinion-score method is used. The critical analysis and
comparative study demonstrate the outperformance of proposed contextual AV
approach, over A-only, V-only, spectral subtraction, and log-minimum mean
square error based speech enhancement methods at both low and high SNRs,
revealing its capability to tackle spectro-temporal variation in any real-world

estimate income inequality due to the lack of availability of individual

inequality measures in order to avoid the need to impose a parametric
functional form to describe the income distribution. These estimates neglect
income differences within shares, introducing, therefore, a potential source of
measurement error. The aim of this paper is to explore a nuanced alternative to
estimate income inequality, which leads to a reliable representation of the
income distribution within shares. We examine the performance of the
generalized beta distribution of the second kind and related models to estimate
different inequality measures and compare the accuracy of these estimates with
the nonparametric lower bound in more than 5000 datasets covering 182 countries
over the period 1867-2015. We deploy two different econometric strategies to
estimate the parametric distributions, non-linear least squares and generalised
method of moments, both implemented in R and conveniently available in the
package GB2group. Despite its popularity, the nonparametric approach is
outperformed even the simplest two-parameter models. Our results confirm the
excellent performance of the GB2 distribution to represent income data for a
heterogeneous sample of countries, which provides highly reliable estimates of
several inequality measures. This strong result and the access to an easy tool
to implement the estimation of this family of distributions, we believe, will
incentivize its use, thus contributing to the development of reliable estimates
of inequality trends.

were discovered on 17 August 2017. Multiband observations of the optical
transient have identified brightness and spectrum features broadly consistent
with theoretical predictions. According to the theoretical model, the optical
radiation from a neutron star merger originates from the radioactive decay of
unstable nuclides freshly synthesized in the merger ejecta. In about a day the
ejecta transits from an optically thick state to an optically thin state due to
its subrelativistic expansion. Hence, we expect that about a day after the
merger, the gamma-ray photons produced by radioactive decays start to escape
from the ejecta and make it bright in the MeV band. In this paper, we study the
features of the radioactive gamma-ray emission from a neutron star merger,
including the brightness and the spectrum, and discuss the observability of the
gamma-ray emission. We find that more than $95\%$ of the radiated gamma-ray
energy is carried by photons of $0.2$-$4$ MeV, with a spectrum shaped by the
nucleosynthesis process and the subrelativistic expansion of the ejecta. Under
favorable conditions, a prominent pair annihilation line can be present in the
gamma-ray spectrum with the energy flux about $3$-$5\%$ of the total. For a
merger event similar to GW170817, the gamma-ray emission attains a peak
luminosity $\approx 2\times 10^{41}$erg s$^{-1}$ at $\approx 1.2$ day after the
merger, and fades by a factor of two in about two days. Such a source will be
detectable by Satellite-ETCC if it occurs at a distance $\leq 12$ Mpc.

rejection of the instrument background noise. The covariance outperforms the
Three-Cornered Hat (TCH) method in that the background converges to zero ""out

has been seen in earlier research, the ensuing instability leads to the
formation of propagating electrostatic solitons. We show here that this region
of strong electrostatic turbulence is the predominant electron heating site
when transiting from inflow to outflow. The heating is the result of heating
generated by electrostatic turbulence driven by overlapping beams, and its
macroscopic effect is a quasi-viscous contribution to the overall electron
energy balance. We suggest that instabilities at the separatrix can play a key

neutrons outnumber the protons by a factor of up to 1.54. The computed momentum

requires a sufficient broadening of the quasiparticle pole and the solution of
a differential equation on the imaginary frequency axis. We demonstrate the

physical and chemical initial conditions in the process of star formation. In
particular, observations toward pre-stellar cores of methanol and deuterated
methanol, solely formed on the surface of dust grains, may provide useful
insights on surface processes at low temperatures. Here we analyze maps of CO,
methanol, formaldehyde and their deuterated isotopologues toward a well-known
pre-stellar core. This study allows us to test current gas-dust chemical
models. Single-dish observations of CH$_3$OH, CH$_2$DOH, H$_2$CO,
H$_2\,^{13}$CO, HDCO, D$_2$CO and C$^{17}$O toward the prototypical pre-stellar
core L1544 were performed at the IRAM 30 m telescope. We analyze their column
densities, distributions, and compare these observations with gas-grain
chemical models. The maximum deuterium fraction derived for methanol is
[CH$_2$DOH]/[CH$_3$OH] $\sim$ 0.08$\pm$0.02, while the measured deuterium
fractions of formaldehyde at the dust peak are [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO] $\sim$
0.03$\pm$0.02, [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO] $\sim$ 0.04$\pm$0.03 and [D$_2$CO]/[HDCO]
$\sim$ 1.2$\pm$0.3. Observations differ significantly from the predictions of
models, finding discrepancies between a factor of 10 and a factor of 100 in
most cases. It is clear though that to efficiently produce methanol on the
surface of dust grains, quantum tunneling diffusion of H atoms must be switched
on. It also appears that the currently adopted reactive desorption efficiency
of methanol is overestimated and/or that abstraction reactions play an
important role. More laboratory work is needed to shed light on the chemistry
of methanol, an important precursor of complex organic molecules in space.

planets with radii larger than 1.6 Earth radius (R$_\oplus$) are not rocky, and
must consist of lighter elements, as found by previous studies. We find that
planets with radii above 2.6 R$_\oplus$ cannot be pure-water worlds, and must
contain significant amounts of hydrogen and helium (H-He). We find that planets
with radii larger than about 3 R$_\oplus$, 3.6 R$_\oplus$, and 4.3 R$_\oplus$
are expected to consist of 2%, 5% and 10% of H-He, respectively. We investigate
the sensitivity of the results to the assumed internal structure, the planetary
temperature and albedo, and the accuracy of the mass and radius determination.
We show that the envelope's metallicity, the percentage of H-He and the
distribution of the elements play a significant role in the determination of
the threshold radius. Finally, we conclude that despite the degenerate nature
of the problem, it is possible to put limits on the possible range of

show that the most frequently violated heuristics from Nielsen set are
consistency, documentation, and the average severity rating of all the problems
is minor. The results also show that the most frequently violated WCAG 2

out-of-time-order correlators at finite temperature. Recent work argued that a
timescale logarithmic in the central charge emerged in the context of
two-dimensional conformal field theories, provided the intermediate channel was
dominated by the Virasoro identity block. This suggests a wide class of
conformal field theories exhibit a version of fast scrambling. In the present
work we study this idea in more detail. We begin by clarifying to what extent
correlators of wavepackets built out of superpositions of primary operators may
be used to quantify quantum scrambling. Subject to certain caveats, these
results concur with previous work. We then go on to study the contribution of
intermediate states beyond the Virasoro identity block. We find that at late
times, time-ordered correlators exhibit a familiar decoupling theorem,
suppressing the contribution of higher dimension operators. However this is no
longer true of the out-of-time-order correlators relevant for the discussion of
quantum chaos. We compute the contributions of these conformal blocks to the
relevant correlators, and find they are able to dominate in many interesting
limits. Interpreting these results in the context of holographic models of
quantum gravity, sheds new light on the black hole information problem by
exhibiting a class of correlators where bulk effective field theory does not
predict its own demise.

when agents react to the new regulatory regime in unanticipated ways to
circumvent enforcement. We present a research strategy that uncovers such
reactions, and permits program evaluation net of such adaptive behaviors. Our
interventions were designed to reduce over-fishing of the critically endangered
Pacific hake by either (a) monitoring and penalizing vendors that sell illegal
fish or (b) discouraging consumers from purchasing using an information
campaign. Vendors attempt to circumvent the ban through hidden sales and other
means, which we track using mystery shoppers. Instituting random monitoring
visits are much more effective in reducing true hake availability by limiting
such cheating, compared to visits that occur on a predictable schedule.
Monitoring at higher frequency (designed to limit temporal displacement of
illegal sales) backfires, because targeted agents learn faster, and cheat more
effectively. Sophisticated policy design is therefore crucial for determining
the sustained, longer-term effects of enforcement. Data collected from
fishermen, vendors, and consumers allow us to document the upstream,
downstream, spillover, and equilibrium effects of enforcement on the entire
supply chain. The consumer information campaign generates two-thirds of the
gains compared to random monitoring, but is simpler for the government to
implement and almost as cost-effective.

undergo stochastic acceleration due to the `discreteness' of the clusters (the
finiteness of the total stellar number), in addition to fundamental two-body
relaxation processes. The acceleration is the essential non-collective
many-body relaxation process. However, existing works have never detailed the
`discreteness' stochastic acceleration and the corresponding mathematical
model, i.e., the generalized-Landau (g-Landau) kinetic equation for the stellar
distribution function. The present paper shows the kinetic formulation of an
orbit-averaged g-Landau equation in action-angle coordinates, beginning with
Bogoliubox-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy. We show that only the g-Landau
equation can satisfy the anti-normalization condition among existing
approximated star-cluster kinetic equations if gravitational polarization is
neglected. Accordingly, only the equation can correctly define the total energy
and the total number of stars in phase space. It also holds the conservation
laws and the H-theorem. We further show that stars undergoing the discreteness
stochastic acceleration can hold these physical properties independently of
stars experiencing the two-body relaxation. Lastly, we suggest that the
stochastic acceleration tends to isotropize the stellar DF and to drive star
clusters into a stationary state in the early relaxation-evolution stage before
the two-body relaxation thermalizes stars.

extend the Kantorovich monad further to a certain class of ordered metric
spaces, by endowing the spaces of probability measures with the usual
stochastic order. It can be considered a metric analogue of the probabilistic
powerdomain.
  The spaces we consider, which we call L-ordered, are spaces where the order
satisfies a mild compatibility condition with the metric itself, rather than
merely with the underlying topology. As we show, this is related to the theory
of Lawvere metric spaces, in which the partial order structure is induced by
the zero distances.
  We show that the algebras of the ordered Kantorovich monad are the closed
convex subsets of Banach spaces equipped with a closed positive cone, with
algebra morphisms given by the short and monotone affine maps. Considering the
category of L-ordered metric spaces as a locally posetal 2-category, the lax
and oplax algebra morphisms are exactly the concave and convex short maps,
respectively.
  In the unordered case, we had identified the Wasserstein space as the colimit
of the spaces of empirical distributions of finite sequences. We prove that
this extends to the ordered setting as well by showing that the stochastic
order arises by completing the order between the finite sequences, generalizing
a recent result of Lawson. The proof holds on any metric space equipped with a
closed partial order.

  In this work we present an experimental study of integer sorting on multicore

radixes, deterministic regular oversampling and random oversampling parallel
sorting, and also some previously little explored or unexplored variants of
bitonic-sort and odd-even transposition sort.
  The study uses multithreading and multiprocessing parallel programming
libraries with the C language implementations working under Open MPI,
MulticoreBSP, and BSPlib utilizing the same source code.
  A secondary objective is to attempt to model the performance of these
algorithm implementations under the MBSP (Multi-memory BSP) model. We first
provide some general high-level observations on the performance of these
implementations. If we can conclude anything is that accurate prediction of
performance by taking into consideration architecture dependent features such
as the structure and characteristics of multiple memory hierarchies is
difficult and more often than not untenable. To some degree this is affected by
the overhead imposed by the high-level library used in the programming effort.
We can still draw however some reliable conclusions and reason about the
performance of these implementations using the MBSP model, thus making MBSP
useful and usable.

been conventionally discussed based on cumulative two-body relaxation process.
The relaxation process requires a cut-off on the range of two-body encounter
between stars in physical space and the relaxation time is characterized by
Coulomb logarithm $\ln[N]$; the conventional cut-off on the encounter distance
in the literature gives ""dominant"" effect. In addition, incorrect cut-offs
exposed a mathematical ""infinite-density"" problem in the late stage of
core-collapse.
  The present paper shows these are merely the results due to incorrect cut-off
process. If one correctly constrains the cut-off on interaction range between
stars based on truncated BBGKY hierarchy, one must introduce a self-consistent
'truncated' Newtonian mean-field (m.f.) acceleration of star. The present paper
shows the effect of total number on the structure of finite star cluster (in
which stars undergo only two-body encounters) for the first time after
establishing a mathematical formulation of a generalized Landau kinetic
equation that includes the cut-off effect on both of collision term and m.f.
potential by employing a BBGKY hierarchy for truncated DF stars. The cut-off
effect increases the typical relaxation time by a few of percentage, which
means the effect of cut-off itself is ""non-dominant"" on the relaxation time. On
the other hand, the cut-off on m.f. acceleration is necessary to avoid
""infinite-density"" problem at the center of the system; the effect of total
number $N$ on density profile and m.f. acceleration are shown by applying the
truncated-DF BBGKY hierarchy to a toy model (a quasi-static modified Hubble
density profile) for a core-halo structure of a star cluster at the late stage
of evolution.

possible phase behavior of the charged accelerating black holes is also
discussed in a standard thermodynamic analysis. Furthermore, we also
investigate the properties of holographic heat engines with charged
accelerating AdS black holes as the working substance in a benchmarking scheme.
We find that the efficiencies of the black hole heat engines can be influenced
by both the size of the benchmark circular cycle and the cosmic string tension.
More interestingly, the existence of charge may significantly increase the
efficiencies of the black hole heat engines and make them be more sensitive to
a varying cosmic string tension. A cross-comparison of the efficiencies of
different black hole heat engines suggests that the acceleration also increases

by mixing in-plane and out-of-plain polarization components of the incident
light, the measurements of the changes of the refractive index of the adjacent
media can be efficiently performed by observing the shift of the steep slope of
the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) reflectance curve. We have demonstrated
that such sensing can be performed by observing the angular shift of the SPR
curve as well as the spectral shift. The developed model can account for an
arbitrary number of layers and is used to simulate the response when an
additional functionalizing layer adjacent to the gold film is used.

  Classification","15 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning has revolutionized the performance of classification, but
meanwhile demands sufficient labeled data for training. Given insufficient
data, while many techniques have been developed to help combat overfitting, the
challenge remains if one tries to train deep networks, especially in the
ill-posed extremely low data regimes: only a small set of labeled data are
available, and nothing -- including unlabeled data -- else. Such regimes arise
from practical situations where not only data labeling but also data collection
itself is expensive. We propose a deep adversarial data augmentation (DADA)
technique to address the problem, in which we elaborately formulate data
augmentation as a problem of training a class-conditional and supervised
generative adversarial network (GAN). Specifically, a new discriminator loss is
proposed to fit the goal of data augmentation, through which both real and
augmented samples are enforced to contribute to and be consistent in finding
the decision boundaries. Tailored training techniques are developed
accordingly. To quantitatively validate its effectiveness, we first perform
extensive simulations to show that DADA substantially outperforms both
traditional data augmentation and a few GAN-based options. We then extend
experiments to three real-world small labeled datasets where existing data
augmentation and/or transfer learning strategies are either less effective or
infeasible. All results endorse the superior capability of DADA in enhancing
the generalization ability of deep networks trained in practical extremely low
data regimes. Source code is available at

inclusion of several communication interfaces. These are mainly wired,

runoff or water level are beneficial to various areas of society. Probabilistic
state-of-the-art hydrological ensemble prediction models are usually driven
with meteorological ensemble forecasts. Hence, biases and dispersion errors of
the meteorological forecasts cascade down to the hydrological predictions and
add to the errors of the hydrological models. The systematic parts of these
errors can be reduced by applying statistical post-processing. For a sound
estimation of predictive uncertainty and an optimal correction of systematic
errors, statistical post-processing methods should be tailored to the
particular forecast variable at hand. Former studies have shown that it can
make sense to treat hydrological quantities as bounded variables. In this
paper, a doubly truncated Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method, which allows
for flexible post-processing of (multi-model) ensemble forecasts of water
level, is introduced. A case study based on water level for a gauge of river
Rhine, reveals a good predictive skill of doubly truncated BMA compared both to

step closer to real-life systems are register transducers: they can store

to some of the standard reduced-order multi-machine models, including the
classical second-order swing equations. In addition, the energy functions for
the reduced-order multi-machine models are derived, which allows to represent
