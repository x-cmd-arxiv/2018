independence, like quantile independence? In the context of identifying causal
effects of a treatment variable, we argue that such deviations should be chosen
based on the form of selection on unobservables they allow. For quantile
independence, we characterize this form of treatment selection. Specifically,
we show that quantile independence is equivalent to a constraint on the average
value of either a latent propensity score (for a binary treatment) or the cdf
of treatment given the unobservables (for a continuous treatment). In both
cases, this average value constraint requires a kind of non-monotonic treatment
selection. Using these results, we show that several common treatment selection
models are incompatible with quantile independence. We introduce a class of
assumptions which weakens quantile independence by removing the average value
constraint, and therefore allows for monotonic treatment selection. In a
potential outcomes model with a binary treatment, we derive identified sets for
the ATT and QTT under both classes of assumptions. In a numerical example we
show that the average value constraint inherent in quantile independence has
substantial identifying power. Our results suggest that researchers should
carefully consider the credibility of this non-monotonicity property when using
quantile independence to weaken full independence.

  theory",,,,,"nlin.SI math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The non-commutative integrability (NCI) is a property fulfilled by some
Hamiltonian systems that ensures, among other things, the exact solvability of
their corresponding equations of motion. The latter means that an ""explicit
formula"" for the trajectories of these systems can be constructed. Such a
construction rests mainly on the so-called Lie theorem on integrability by
quadratures. It is worth mentioning that, in the context of Hamiltonian
systems, the NCI has been for around 40 years, essentially, the unique
criterium for exact solvability expressed in the terms of first integrals
(containing the usual Liouville-Arnold integrability criterium as a particular
case). Concretely, a Hamiltonian system with $n$ degrees of freedom is said to
be non-commutative integrable if a set of independent first integrals
$F_{1},...,F_{l}$ are known such that: the kernel of the $l\times l$ matrix
with coefficients $\left\{ F_{i},F_{j}\right\} $, where $\left\{
\cdot,\cdot\right\} $ denotes the canonical Poisson bracket, has dimension
$2n-l$ (isotropy); and each bracket $\left\{ F_{i},F_{j}\right\} $ is
functionally dependent on $F_{1},...,F_{l}$ (closure). In this paper, we
develop two procedures for constructing the trajectories of a Hamiltonian
system which only require isotropic first integrals (closure condition is not
needed). One of them is based on an extended version of the geometric
Hamilton-Jacobi theory, and does not rely on the above mentioned Lie's theorem.
We do all that in the language of functions of several variables.

packing fraction $\phi$. MS packings of frictionless disks occur as geometric
families (i.e. parabolic segments with positive curvature) in the
$\phi$-$\gamma$ plane. MS packings from protocol 1 populate parabolic segments
with both signs of the slope, $d\phi/d\gamma >0$ and $d\phi/d\gamma <0$. In
contrast, MS packings from protocol 2 populate segments with $d\phi/d\gamma <0$
only. For both simple and pure shear, we derive a relationship between the
stress anisotropy and dilatancy $d\phi/d\gamma$ obeyed by MS packings along
geometrical families. We show that for MS packings prepared using isotropic
compression, the stress anisotropy distribution is Gaussian centered at zero
with a standard deviation that decreases with increasing system size. For shear
jammed MS packings, the stress anisotropy distribution is a convolution of
Weibull distributions that depend on strain, which has a nonzero average and
standard deviation in the large-system limit. We also develop a framework to
calculate the stress anisotropy distribution for packings generated via
protocol 2 in terms of the stress anisotropy distribution for packings

different MS packing probabilities, which lead to differences in macroscopic

long-term monitoring of the patients heart behavior. This paper proposes a
method denoted by block sparse MlEC (BlS MlEC) in order to exploit between-lead
correlations to compress the signals in a more efficient way. This is due to
the fact that multi-lead ECG signals are multiple observations of the same
source (heart) from different locations. Consequently, they have high
correlation in terms of the support set of their sparse models which leads them
to share dominant common structure. In order to obtain the block sparse model,
the collaborative version of lasso estimator is applied. In addition, we have
shown that raised cosine kernel has advantages over conventional Gaussian and
wavelet (Daubechies family) due to its specific properties. It is demonstrated
that using raised cosine kernel in constructing the sparsifying basis matrix
gives a sparser model which results in higher compression ratio and lower
reconstruction error. The simulation results show the average improvement of
37%, 88% and 90-97% for BlS M-lEC compared to the non-collaborative case with
raised cosine kernel, Gaussian kernel and collaborative case with Daubechies

interferometers are not imaged directly but have to be inferred from sine like
signal variations occurring in a series of images acquired at varying relative
positions of the interferometer's gratings. The absolute spatial translations
involved in the acquisition of these phase stepping series usually lie in the
range of only a few hundred nanometers, wherefore positioning errors as small
as 10nm will already translate into signal uncertainties of one to ten percent
in the final images if not accounted for.
  Classically, the relative grating positions in the phase stepping series are
considered input parameters to the analysis and are, for the Fast Fourier
Transform that is typically employed, required to be equidistantly distributed
over multiples of the gratings' period. More general optimization based
approaches with relaxed requirements on the sampling positions are often deemed
too time consuming in contrast.
  In the following, a fast converging optimization scheme is presented
simultaneously determining the phase stepping curves' parameters as well as the
actually performed motions of the stepped grating, including also erroneous
rotational motions which are commonly neglected. While the correction of solely
the translational errors along the stepping direction is found to be sufficient
with regard to the reduction of image artifacts, the possibility to also detect
minute rotations about all axes proves to be a valuable tool for system
calibration and monitoring. The simplicity of the provided algorithm, in
particular when only considering translational errors, makes it well suitable
as a standard evaluation procedure also for large image series.

photon-counting detectors (PCDs) with energy discrimination capabilities have
demonstrated great potentials in various applications of medical x-ray
radiography and computed tomography (CT). However, the advantages of PCDs may
be compromised by various hardware-related degradation factors. For example, at
high count rate, quasi-coincident photons may be piled up and result in not
only lost counts but also distorted spectrums, which is called the pulse pileup
effects. Considering the relative slow detection speed of current PCDs and high
x-ray flux for clinical imaging, it is vital to develop an effective approach
to compensate or correct for the pileup effect. The aim of this paper was to
develop a model-free, end-to-end, and data-driven approach in the neural
network framework. We first introduce the trigger threshold concept to
regularize the correction process. Then, we design a fully-connected cascade
artificial neural network and train it with measurements and true counts. After
training, the network is used to recover raw photon-counting data for higher
fidelity. To evaluate the proposed approach, Monte Carlo simulations are
conducted. We simulate four types of PCDs combining the unipolar or bipolar
pulse shape with the nonparalyzable or paralyzable detection mode. The
simulation results demonstrate that the trained neural network decreases the
relative error of count averages of raw data by an order of magnitude while
maintaining a reasonable variance over a wide range of attenuation paths.

promising resource for the realization of high-fidelity quantum operations in
noisy devices, due to their intrinsic fault-tolerance against noise and
experimental imperfections. Despite their conceptual appeal and proven
fault-tolerance, for a long time their practical use in quantum computing was
limited to proof of principle demonstrations. Only in 2012 Sj\""oqvist et al.
formulated a strategy to generate non-Abelian (i.e. holonomic) quantum gates
through non-adiabatic transformation. Successful experimental demonstrations of
this concept followed on various physical qubit systems and proved the
feasibility of this fast, holonomic quantum gate concept. Despite these
successes, the experimental implementation of such non-Abelian quantum gates
remains experimentally challenging since in general the emergence of a suitable
holonomy requires encoding of the logical qubit within a three (or higher)
level system being driven by two (or more) control fields.
  A very recent proposal by Liang et al. offers an elegant solution generating
a non-Abelian, geometric quantum gate on a simple, two-level system driven by
one control field. Exploiting the concept of transitionless quantum driving it
allows the generation of universal geometric quantum gates through
superadiabatic evolution. This concept thus generates fast and robust
phase-based quantum gates on the basis of minimal experimental resources. Here,
we report on the first such implementation of a set of non-commuting
single-qubit superadiabatic geometric quantum gates on the electron spin of the
negatively charged nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. The realized quantum
gates combine high-fidelity and fast quantum gate performance. This provides a
promising and powerful tool for large-scale quantum computing under realistic,

fundamental model for the analysis of concurrent processes, parameterized
systems, and are also used as abstract models of programs in resource bound
analysis. In this paper we study the problem of obtaining asymptotic bounds on
the termination time of a given VASS. In particular, we focus on the
practically important case of obtaining polynomial bounds on termination time.
Our main contributions are as follows: First, we present a polynomial-time
algorithm for deciding whether a given VASS has a linear asymptotic complexity.
We also show that if the complexity of a VASS is not linear, it is at least
quadratic. Second, we classify VASS according to quantitative properties of
their cycles. We show that certain singularities in these properties are the
key reason for non-polynomial asymptotic complexity of VASS. In absence of
singularities, we show that the asymptotic complexity is always polynomial and
of the form $\Theta(n^k)$, for some integer $k\leq d$, where $d$ is the
dimension of the VASS. We present a polynomial-time algorithm computing the
optimal $k$. For general VASS, the same algorithm, which is based on a complete
technique for the construction of ranking functions in VASS, produces a valid
lower bound, i.e., a $k$ such that the termination complexity is $\Omega(n^k)$.
Our results are based on new insights into the geometry of VASS dynamics, which
hold the potential for further applicability to VASS analysis.

calculations. From a pool of 869 known binary and ternary quasi-2D materials,
we have identified 135 non-centrosymmetric crystals of which 48 systems are
found to have \textbf{d} components larger than the longitudinal piezoelectric
modulus of AlN (a common piezoelectric for resonators), and three systems with
the response greater than that of PbTiO$_3$, which is among the materials with
largest known piezoelectric modulus. None of the identified materials have
previously been considered for piezoelectric applications. Furthermore, we find
that large \textbf{d} components always couple to the deformations (shearing or
axial) of van der Waals ""gaps"" between the layers and are indeed enabled by the
weak intra-layer interactions.

the processing units. Among these architectures, the Synchronous Control
Asynchronous Dataflow (SCAD) architecture is a new exposed datapath
architecture whose processing units are equipped with first-in first-out (FIFO)

  In contrast to register-based machines, the optimal code generation for SCAD
is still a matter of research. In particular, SAT and SMT solvers were used to
generate optimal resource constrained and optimal time constrained schedules
for SCAD, respectively. As Answer Set Programming (ASP) offers better
flexibility in handling such scheduling problems, we focus in this paper on
using an answer set solver for both resource and time constrained optimal SCAD
code generation. As a major benefit of using ASP, we are able to generate
\emph{all} optimal schedules for a given program which allows one to study
their properties. Furthermore, the experimental results of this paper
demonstrate that the answer set solver can compete with SAT solvers and
outperforms SMT solvers. \emph{This paper is under consideration for acceptance

presence of large number of variants with only tiny or moderate effects.
However, due to the limited sample size of a single GWAS, many associated
genetic variants are too weak to achieve the genome-wide significance. These
undiscovered variants further limit the prediction capability of GWAS.
Restricted access to the individual-level data and the increasing availability
of the published GWAS results motivate the development of methods integrating
both the individual-level and summary-level data. How to build the connection
between the individual-level and summary-level data determines the efficiency
of using the existing abundant summary-level resources with limited
individual-level data, and this issue inspires more efforts in the existing

novel way of modeling the connection between the individual-level data and

such as Type 1 diabetes, Ulcerative colitis and Primary biliary cirrhosis. LEP

hash codes with semantics to the input-output pair, cycle consistency loss is
further proposed upon the adversarial training to strengthen the correlations
between inputs and corresponding outputs. Our approach is generative to learn
hash functions such that the learned hash codes can maximally correlate each
input-output correspondence, meanwhile can also regenerate the inputs so as to
minimize the information loss. The learning to hash embedding is thus performed
to jointly optimize the parameters of the hash functions across modalities as

eccentricity of $\sim 0.88$ yields the relativistic pericentre shift of $\sim

possible Newtonian perturbations as well as reference-frame uncertainties. A
naive way to solve this problem is to find stars with smaller pericentre
distances, $r_{\rm p}\lesssim 1529$ Schwarzschild radii ($120\,{\rm AU}$), and
thus more prominent relativistic effects. In this contribution, we show that to
detect stars on relativistic orbits is progressively less likely given the
volume shrinkage and the expected stellar density distributions. Finally, one
arrives to a sparse region, where the total number of bright stars is expected
to fall below one. One can, however, still potentially detect stars crossing

two promising methods for low-power electrical manipulation of magnetization.
Recently, magnetic field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization through
SHE has been reported with the aid of an exchange bias from an
antiferromagnetic IrMn layer. In this letter, we experimentally demonstrate
that the IrMn/CoFeB/MgO structure exhibits a VCMA effect of 39 fJ/Vm, which is
comparable to that of the Ta/CoFeB/MgO structure. Magnetization dynamics under
a combination of the SHE and VCMA are modeled and simulated. It is found that,
by applying a voltage of 1.5 V, the critical SHE switching current can be
decreased by 10 times owing to the VCMA effect, leading to low-power
operations. Furthermore, a high-density spintronic memory structure can be
built with multiple magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) located on a single IrMn
strip. Through hybrid CMOS/MTJ simulations, we demonstrate that fast-speed
write operations can be achieved with power consumption of only 8.5 fJ/bit.
These findings reveal the possibility to realize high-density and low-power

representations to quickly generalize to unseen observations on-the-fly and

methods are developed in a pair-wise similarity learning system to detect a
fixed set of features from distinct regions which are mapped to their vector
embeddings for the distance measuring. However, the most relevant and crucial
parts of each image are detected independently without referring to the
dependency conditioned on one and another. Also, these region based methods
rely on spatial manipulation to position the local features in comparable

the Deep Co-attention based Comparators (DCCs) that fuse the co-dependent

both images and produce their \textit{relative representations}. Given a pair
of pedestrian images to be compared, the proposed model mimics the foveation of
human eyes to detect distinct regions concurrent on both images, namely
co-dependent features, and alternatively attend to relevant regions to fuse
them into the similarity learning. Our comparator is capable of producing
dynamic representations relative to a particular sample every time, and thus
well-suited to the case of re-identifying pedestrians on-the-fly. We perform

matrix completion and network localization. However, the problem (AMRM) is
NP-hard in general due to the combinational nature of the matrix rank function.
There are many alternative functions have been proposed to substitute the
matrix rank function, which lead to many corresponding alternative minimization
problems solved efficiently by some popular convex or nonconvex optimization
algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new nonconvex function, namely,
$TL_{\alpha}^{\epsilon}$ function (with $0\leq\alpha<1$ and $\epsilon>0$), to
approximate the rank function, and translate the NP-hard problem (AMRM) into
the $TL_{p}^{\epsilon}$ function affine matrix rank minimization (TLAMRM)

proved that the uniqueness of global minimizer of the problem (TLAMRM) also

an equilibrium collides with a discontinuity surface in a piecewise-smooth
system of ODEs. Under certain genericity conditions, at a BEB the equilibrium
either transitions to a pseudo-equilibrium (on the discontinuity surface) or
collides and annihilates with a coexisting pseudo-equilibrium. These two
scenarios are distinguished by the sign of a certain inner product. Here it is
shown that this sign can be determined from the number of unstable directions
associated with the two equilibria by using techniques developed by Feigin. A
new normal form is proposed for BEBs in systems of any number of dimensions.
The normal form involves a companion matrix, as does the leading order sliding
dynamics, and so the connection to the stability of the equilibria is explicit.
In two dimensions the parameters of the normal form distinguish, in a simple
way, the eight topologically distinct cases for the generic local dynamics at a
BEB. A numerical exploration in three dimensions reveals that BEBs can create
multiple attractors and chaotic attractors, and that the equilibrium at the BEB
can be unstable even if both equilibria are stable. The developments presented
here stem from seemingly unutilised similarities between BEBs in discontinuous
systems (specifically Filippov systems as studied here) and BEBs in continuous
systems for which analogous results are, to date, more advanced.

divergence: the memory requests for some threads are serviced early, while the
remaining requests incur long latencies. This divergence stalls the warp, as it
cannot execute the next instruction until all requests from the current
instruction complete. In this work, we make three new observations. First,
GPGPU warps exhibit heterogeneous memory divergence behavior at the shared
cache: some warps have most of their requests hit in the cache, while other
warps see most of their request miss. Second, a warp retains the same
divergence behavior for long periods of execution. Third, requests going to the
shared cache can incur queuing delays as large as hundreds of cycles,
exacerbating the effects of memory divergence. We propose a set of techniques,

model of friction of completely damaged rock. We systematically vary the impact
velocity from 50 m/s to 400 m/s and the impact angle from 5 degrees to 45
degrees. We investigate shapes of the largest remnants resulting from
collisional simulations. As a result, various shapes (bilobed, spherical, flat,
elongated, and hemispherical shapes) are formed through equal-mass and
low-velocity (50 - 400 m/s) impacts. We clarify a range of the impact angle and
velocity to form each shape. Our results indicate that irregular shapes,
especially flat shapes, of asteroids with diameters larger than 80 km are
likely to be formed through similar-mass and low-velocity impacts, which are
likely to occur in the primordial environment prior to the formation of
Jupiter.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a class of promising scalable memory
technologies that can potentially offer higher capacity than DRAM at the same
cost point. Unfortunately, the access latency and energy of NVM is often higher
than those of DRAM, while the endurance of NVM is lower. Many DRAM-NVM hybrid
memory systems use DRAM as a cache to NVM, to achieve the low access latency,
low energy, and high endurance of DRAM, while taking advantage of the large
capacity of NVM. A key question for a hybrid memory system is what data to
cache in DRAM to best exploit the advantages of each technology while avoiding
the disadvantages of each technology as much as possible.
  We propose a new memory controller design that improves hybrid memory
performance and energy efficiency. We observe that both DRAM and NVM banks
employ row buffers that act as a cache for the most recently accessed memory
row. Accesses that are row buffer hits incur similar latencies (and energy
consumption) in both DRAM and NVM, whereas accesses that are row buffer misses
incur longer latencies (and higher energy consumption) in NVM than in DRAM. To
exploit this, we devise a policy that caches heavily-reused data that
frequently misses in the NVM row buffers into DRAM. Our policy tracks the row
buffer miss counts of recently-used rows in NVM, and caches in DRAM the rows
that are predicted to incur frequent row buffer misses. Our proposed policy
also takes into account the high write latencies of NVM, in addition to row
buffer locality and more likely places the write-intensive pages in DRAM
instead of NVM.

ineffective at solving this problem due to the very large amount of GPU memory

these algorithms with enough visibility across the global request stream.
  Previously-proposed memory controller (MC) designs use a single monolithic

together requests to the same DRAM row to increase row buffer hit rates.
Second, the MC arbitrates among the requesters (CPUs and GPU) to optimize for
overall system throughput, average response time, fairness and quality of
service. Third, the MC manages the low-level DRAM command scheduling to
complete requests while ensuring compliance with all DRAM timing and power

Staged Memory Scheduler (SMS), which decouples the three primary MC tasks into
three significantly simpler structures that together improve system performance

improvement and fairness improvement compared to the best previous

adopted to assign to each remaining system a probability of being lensed.

that are fully detected in Gaia DR2. These are the most promising new quasar
lens candidates from Gaia DR2 and a simple singular isothermal ellipsoid lens
model is able to reproduce their image positions to within $\sim$1 mas. This

The effectiveness of the WaveNet vocoder for generating natural speech from
acoustic features has been proved in recent works. However, it sometimes
generates very noisy speech with collapsed speech segments when only a limited
amount of training data is available or significant acoustic mismatches exist
between the training and testing data. Such a limitation on the corpus and
limited ability of the model can easily occur in some speech generation
applications, such as voice conversion and speech enhancement. To address this
problem, we propose a technique to automatically detect collapsed speech
segments. Moreover, to refine the detected segments, we also propose a waveform
generation technique for WaveNet using a linear predictive coding constraint.
Verification and subjective tests are conducted to investigate the
effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The verification results indicate
that the detection technique can detect most collapsed segments. The subjective
evaluations of voice conversion demonstrate that the generation technique
significantly improves the speech quality while maintaining the same speaker

the system, leading to decoherence. Controlling decoherence is one of the
biggest challenges to be overcome to build quantum computers. We have used
several experimental strategies to decouple the quantum system from its
environment. These strategies are based on how much we know about
system-environment interaction and what states we want to preserve. We first
consider a case where we are aware of the system state but have no knowledge
about its interaction with the environment. We demonstrate the efficacy of the
super-Zeno scheme to tackle decoherence in this case. Then we consider a
situation where only the subspace is known to which the system state belongs.
To address such a situation we used a nested Uhrig dynamical decoupling scheme.
Next, we consider situations where we have knowledge of the state of the system
as well as its interaction with the environment. In such situations, since the
noise model is known, decoupling strategies can be explicitly designed to
cancel this noise. Using these decoupling strategies, we can experimentally
extend the lifetime of time-invariant discord of two-qubit Bell-diagonal states
and are also able to preserve the entanglement of three NMR qubits, to a
remarkable extent.

we review recent theoretical and experimental advances in studies of MBL
systems, focusing on the new perspective provided by entanglement and
non-equilibrium experimental probes such as quantum quenches. Theoretically,
MBL systems exhibit a new kind of robust integrability: an extensive set of
quasi-local integrals of motion emerges, which provides an intuitive
explanation of the breakdown of thermalization. A description based on
quasi-local integrals of motion is used to predict dynamical properties of MBL
systems, such as the spreading of quantum entanglement, the behavior of local
observables, and the response to external dissipative processes. Furthermore,
MBL systems can exhibit eigenstate transitions and quantum orders forbidden in
thermodynamic equilibrium. We outline the current theoretical understanding of
the quantum-to-classical transition between many-body localized and ergodic
phases, and anomalous transport in the vicinity of that transition.
Experimentally, synthetic quantum systems, which are well-isolated from an
external thermal reservoir, provide natural platforms for realizing the MBL
phase. We review recent experiments with ultracold atoms, trapped ions,
superconducting qubits, and quantum materials, in which different signatures of

proof of cut elimination for various subsystems of second order arithmetic. Our
goal is to understand it from an algebraic point of view. Among many proofs of
cut elimination for higher order logics, Maehara and Okada's algebraic proofs
are of particular interest, since the essence of their arguments can be
algebraically described as the (Dedekind-)MacNeille completion together with
Girard's reducibility candidates. Interestingly, it turns out that the
$\Omega$-rule, formulated as a rule of logical inference, finds its algebraic
foundation in the MacNeille completion.
  In this paper, we consider the parameter-free fragments LIP0, LIP1, LIP2, ...
of the second order intuitionistic logic, that correspond to the arithmetical
theories ID0, ID1, ID2, ... of iterated inductive definitions up to omega. In
this setting, we observe a formal connection between the Omega-rule and the
MacNeille completion, that leads to a way of interpreting second order
quantifiers in a first order way in Heyting-valued semantics, called the
Omega-interpretation. Based on this, we give an algebraic proof of cut
elimination for LIPn for every n<omega that can be locally formalized in IDn.
As a consequence, we obtain an equivalence between the cut elimination for LIPn

classification error on the target language labels, without using the external,

are not independent of each other, there is a dependency enforced by, for
example, the language family, which affects negatively on classification. The
other external information sources (e.g. audio encoding, telephony or video
speech) can also decrease classification accuracy. In this paper, we attempt to
solve these issues by constructing a deep hierarchical neural network, where
different levels of meta-information are encapsulated by attentive prediction
units and also embedded into the training progress. The proposed method learns
auxiliary tasks to obtain robust internal representation and to construct a
variant of attentive units within the hierarchical model. The final result is
the structural prediction of the target language and a closely related language
family. The algorithm reflects a ""staircase"" way of learning in both its
architecture and training, advancing from the fundamental audio encoding to the
language family level and finally to the target language level. This process
not only improves generalization but also tackles the issues of imbalanced

application, yet predicting such turbulence is difficult due to its complexity.
High-Reynolds-number turbulence, which includes most practical flows, is
particularly complicated because of its wide range of scales. Although the
attached-eddy hypothesis postulated by Townsend can be used to predict
turbulence intensities and serves as a unified theory for the asymptotic
behaviors of turbulence, the presence of attached structures has not been
confirmed.Here, we demonstrate the logarithmic region of turbulence intensity
by identifying wall-attached structures of velocity fluctuations ($u_i$)
through direct numerical simulation of a moderate-Reynolds-number boundary
layer ($Re_\tau \approx 1000$). The wall-attached structures are self-similar
with respect to their heights ($l_y$), and in particular the population density
of the streamwise component ($u$) scales inversely with $l_y$, which is
reminiscent of the hierarchy of attached eddies. The turbulent intensities
contained within the wall-parallel components ($u$ and $w$) exhibit the
logarithmic behavior. The tall attached structures ($l_y^+ > 100$) of $u$ are
composed of multiple uniform momentum zones (UMZs) with a long streamwise
extent, whereas those of the cross-stream components ($v$ and $w$) are
relatively short with a comparable width, suggesting the presence of tall
vortical structures associated with multiple UMZs. The magnitudes of the
near-wall peak observed in the streamwise turbulent intensity increase with
increasing $l_y$, reflecting nested hierarchies of the attached $u$ structures.
These findings suggest that the identified structures are prime candidates for
Townsend's attached-eddy hypothesis and serve as cornerstones for understanding
the multiscale phenomena of high-Reynolds-number boundary layers.

mostly in children and CLL occurs mainly in old people. However, the
Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL (Ph+-ALL) and the Ph-like ALL occur in
both children and adults. To understand childhood leukemia/lymphoma, we have
recently proposed two hypotheses on the causes and the mechanism of cell
transformation of a LC. Hypothesis A is: repeated bone-remodeling during
bone-growth and bone-repair may be a source of cell injuries of marrow cells
including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), myeloid cells, and LCs. Hypothesis B
is: a LC may have three pathways on transformation: a slow, a rapid, and an
accelerated. We discuss in the present paper the developing mechanisms of ALL
and CLL by these hypotheses. Having a peak incidence in young children, ALL may
develop mainly as a result of rapid cell transformation of a lymphoblast (or
pro-lymphocyte). Differently, Ph+-ALL and Ph-like ALL may develop as results of
transformation of a lymphoblast via accelerated pathway. Occurring mainly in
adults, CLL may be a result of transformation of a memory B-cell via slow
pathway. By causing cell injuries of HSCs and LCs, repeated bone-remodeling
during bone-growth and bone-repair may be related to the cell transformation of
a LC. In conclusion, ALL may develop as a result of cell transformation of a
lymphoblast via rapid or accelerated pathway; and repeated bone-remodeling
during bone-growth may be a trigger for the cell transformation of a
lymphoblast in a child.

in lymph nodes (LNs) or lymphoid tissues (LTs). Some forms of lymphomas,
including Burkitt lymphoma (BL), ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma
(ALK+-ALCL), and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (T-LBL), occur mainly
in children and teenagers. Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) has a peak incidence at age
20s. To understand pediatric lymphoma, we have recently proposed two hypotheses
on the causes and the mechanism of cell transformation of a LC. Hypothesis A
is: repeated bone-remodeling during bone-growth and bone-repair may be a source
of cell injuries of marrow cells including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs),
myeloid cells, and LCs, and thymic involution may be a source of damage to the
developing T-cells in thymus. Hypothesis B is: a LC may have three pathways on
transformation: a slow, a rapid, and an accelerated. In this paper, we discuss
pediatric lymphomas by this hypothesis. Having a peak incidence at young age,
BL, T-LBL, ALK+-ALCL, and HL develop more likely as a result of rapid
transformation of a LC. In BL, ALK+-ALCL, and HL, the cell transformations may
be triggered by severe viral infections. In T-LBL, the cell transformation may
be related to thymic involution. Occurring in both adults and children, diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) may develop via slow or accelerated pathway. In
conclusion, pediatric lymphoma may develop as a result of ""one-step"" cell
transformation of a LC, and severe viral infections may be the main trigger for
the rapid transformation of a LC in a LN/LT.

the local strength of the collapse wave and hence on the radial position of the
bubbles in the cloud. At the same time, the direction of the microjets is
influenced by the distribution of the bubbles in its vicinity. Finally, an
analysis of the pressure pulse spectrum shows that the pressure pulse rate is
well captured by an exponential law.

CML occurin children, we analyzed the causes and the mechanism of cell
transformation of a MC. I. Forthe MCs in marrow cavity, repeated
bone-remodeling during bone-growth may be a source ofcell injuries. II. As a
type of blood cell, a MC may have higher survivability from DNAchanges and
require obtaining fewer cancerous properties for cell transformation than a
tissuecell. III. Point DNA mutations (PDMs) and chromosome changes (CCs) are
the two majortypes of DNA changes. CCs have three subtypes by effects on a
cell: great effect CCs(GECCs), mild-effect CCs (MECCs), and intermediate-effect
CCs (IECCs). A GECC affectsone or more genes and can alone trigger cell
transformation. PDMs/MECCs are mostly mildand can accumulate in cells. Some of
the PDMs/MECCs contribute to cell transformation. AnIECC affects one or more
genes and participates in cell transformation. IV. Based on II andIII, we
hypothesize that a MC may have two pathways on transformation: a slow and
anaccelerated. Slow pathway is driven by accumulation of PDMs/MECCs.
Accelerated pathwayis driven by accumulation of PDMs/MECCs/IECC(s). A
transformation via slow pathwayoccurs at old age; whereas that via accelerated
pathway occurs at any age. Thus, CML andpediatric AML may develop via
accelerated pathway, and adult AML may develop via bothpathways. In conclusion,
pediatric AML and CML may develop as a result of transformationof a MC via

one of the major goals in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computation

rigorous study of the physical resources required for such simulations, where
we focus on the task of Hamiltonian sparsification. The goal is to find a
simulating Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ whose underlying interaction graph has
bounded degree (this is called degree-reduction) or much fewer edges than that
of the original Hamiltonian $H$ (this is called dilution). We set this study in
a relaxed framework for analog simulations that we call gap-simulation, where
$\tilde{H}$ is only required to simulate the groundstate(s) and spectral gap of
$H$ instead of its full spectrum, and we believe it is of independent interest.
  Our main result is a proof that in stark contrast to the classical setting,
general degree-reduction is impossible in the quantum world, even under our
relaxed notion of gap-simulation. The impossibility proof relies on devising
counterexample Hamiltonians and applying a strengthened variant of
Hastings-Koma decay of correlations theorem. We also show a complementary
result where degree-reduction is possible when the strength of interactions is
allowed to grow polynomially. Furthermore, we prove the impossibility of the
related sparsification task of generic Hamiltonian dilution, under a
computational hardness assumption. We also clarify the (currently weak)
implications of our results to the question of quantum PCP. Our work provides
basic answers to many of the ""first questions"" one would ask about Hamiltonian
sparsification and gap-simulation; we hope this serves a good starting point

asks for three elements $a, b, c \in X$ such that $a \oplus b=c$, where $
\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The problem can be easily solved on
a word RAM with word length $w$ in time $O(n^2 \log{n})$. Using Han's fast
integer sorting algorithm (2002/2004) this can be reduced to $O(n^2
\log{\log{n}})$. With randomization or a sophisticated deterministic dictionary
construction, creating a hash table for $X$ with constant lookup time leads to
an algorithm with (expected) running time $O(n^2)$. At present, seemingly no
faster algorithms are known. We present a surprisingly simple deterministic,
quadratic time algorithm for 3XOR. Its core is a version of the Patricia trie
for $X$, which makes it possible to traverse the set $a \oplus X$ in ascending
order for arbitrary $a\in \{0, 1\}^{w}$ in linear time.
  Furthermore, we describe a randomized algorithm for 3XOR with expected
running time $O(n^2\cdot\min\{\log^3{w}/w, (\log\log{n})^2/\log^2 n\})$. The
algorithm transfers techniques to our setting that were used by Baran, Demaine,
and P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu (2005/2008) for solving the related int3SUM problem (the
same problem with integer addition in place of binary XOR) in expected time
$o(n^2)$. As suggested by Jafargholi and Viola (2016), linear hash functions
are employed. The latter authors also showed that assuming 3XOR needs expected
running time $n^{2-o(1)}$ one can prove conditional lower bounds for triangle
enumeration just as with 3SUM. We demonstrate that 3XOR can be reduced to other
problems as well, treating the examples offline SetDisjointness and offline
SetIntersection, which were studied for 3SUM by Kopelowitz, Pettie, and Porat
(2016).

understand many processes. Yet, data accumulation often implies relaxing
acquisition procedures or compounding diverse sources. As a consequence, such
data sets often contain mixed data, i.e. both quantitative and qualitative and
many missing values. Furthermore, aggregated data present a natural
\textit{multilevel} structure, where individuals or samples are nested within
different sites, such as countries or hospitals. Imputation of multilevel data
has therefore drawn some attention recently, but current solutions are not
designed to handle mixed data, and suffer from important drawbacks such as
their computational cost. In this article, we propose a single imputation
method for multilevel data, which can be used to complete either quantitative,
categorical or mixed data. The method is based on multilevel singular value
decomposition (SVD), which consists in decomposing the variability of the data
into two components, the between and within groups variability, and performing
SVD on both parts. We show on a simulation study that in comparison to
competitors, the method has the great advantages of handling data sets of
various size, and being computationally faster. Furthermore, it is the first so
far to handle mixed data. We apply the method to impute a medical data set
resulting from the aggregation of several data sets coming from different
hospitals. This application falls in the framework of a larger project on
Trauma patients. To overcome obstacles associated to the aggregation of medical
data, we turn to distributed computation. The method is implemented in an R
package.

and the Young diagram basis for $ SO(N)$ (and $ Sp(N)$) half-BPS operators. We
find a simple connection between this map and the plethystic refinement of the
Littlewood Richardson coefficients which couple triples of Young diagrams where
two of them are identical. This plethystic refinement is known to be computable
using an algorithm based on domino tilings of Young diagrams. We discuss the
domino combinatorics of the orientifold projection map in terms of giant
graviton branes. The permutation construction of $SO(N)$ operators is used to
find large N generating functions. The structure of these generating functions
is elucidated using the combinatorics of words, organised according to their
periodicity. Aperiodic words in the $U(N)$ theory are Lyndon words and an
$SO(N)$ analogue of Lyndon words is defined using a minimal periodicity
condition. We calculate the normalization factor for the orthogonal basis of

we study transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers deposited on polymeric
substrates under the application of biaxial strain, both tensile and
compressive. We can control the amount of biaxial strain applied by letting the
substrate thermally expand or compress by changing the substrate temperature.
After modelling the substrate-dependent strain transfer process with a finite
elements simulation, we performed micro-differential spectroscopy of four
transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers (MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, WSe2) under the
application of biaxial strain and measured their optical properties. For
tensile strain we observe a redshift of the bandgap that reaches a value as
large as 94 meV/% in the case of single-layer WS2 deposited on polypropylene.
The observed bandgap shifts as a function of substrate extension/compression
follow the order WS2 > WSe2 > MoS2 > MoSe2.

its inclusion in some modern neoclassical codes. The number of neoclassical

how to train fast (under 1 minute) log-linear neural embeddings of the

classifiers to enable important tasks such as biological link prediction.
Classifiers are trained by concatenating learned entity embeddings to represent
entity relations, and training classifiers on the concatenated embeddings to
discern true relations from automatically generated negative examples. Our
simple embedding methodology greatly improves on classification error compared
to previously published state-of-the-art results, yielding a maximum increase
of $+0.28$ F-measure and $+0.22$ ROC AUC scores for the most difficult
biological link prediction problem. Finally, our embedding approach is orders
of magnitude faster to train ($\leq$ 1 minute vs. hours), much more economical
in terms of embedding dimensions ($d=50$ vs. $d=512$), and naturally encodes
the directionality of the asymmetric biological relations, that can be
controlled by the order with which we concatenate the embeddings.

they are also related to other closed magnetic regions on the Sun such as
quiescent filament regions. This makes CMEs a better indicator of solar
activity. While sunspots mainly represent the toroidal component of solar
magnetism, quiescent filaments (and hence CMEs associated with them) connect
the toroidal and poloidal components via the rush-to-the-pole (RTTP)
phenomenon. Taking the end of RTTP in each hemisphere as an indicator of solar
polarity reversal, it is shown that the north-south reversal asymmetry has a

photo-induced change in THz conductivity with heat-induced changes, we show
that both occur primarily due to heat-generated modification of the Drude

computationally-intensive parallel loops. Dynamic loop scheduling (DLS)
techniques improve the performance of computationally-intensive scientific
applications via load balancing of their execution on high-performance
computing (HPC) systems. Identifying the most suitable choices of data
distribution strategies, system sizes, and DLS techniques which improve the
performance of a given application, requires intensive assessment and a large
number of exploratory native experiments (using real applications on real
systems), which may not always be feasible or practical due to associated time
and costs. In such cases, simulative experiments are more appropriate for
studying the performance of applications. This motivates the question of How
realistic are the simulations of executions of scientific applications using
DLS on HPC platforms? In the present work, a methodology is devised to answer
this question. It involves the experimental verification and analysis of the
performance of DLS in scientific applications. The proposed methodology is
employed for a computer vision application executing using four DLS techniques
on two different HPC plat- forms, both via native and simulative experiments.
The evaluation and analysis of the native and simulative results indicate that
the accuracy of the simulative experiments is strongly influenced by the
approach used to extract the computational effort of the application (FLOP- or
time-based), the choice of application model representation into simulation
(data or task parallel), and the available HPC subsystem models in the
simulator (multi-core CPUs, memory hierarchy, and network topology). The
minimum and the maximum percent errors achieved between the native and the
simulative experiments are 0.95% and 8.03%, respectively.

intuitionistic linear logic ($\mathsf{MELL}$), known as a \emph{linear
category}, is a symmetric monoidal closed category with a monoidal coalgebra
modality (also known as a linear exponential comonad). Inspired by Blute and
Scott's work on categories of modules of Hopf algebras as models of linear
logic, we study categories of algebras of monads (also known as Eilenberg-Moore
categories) as models of $\mathsf{MELL}$. We define a $\mathsf{MELL}$ lifting
monad on a linear category as a Hopf monad -- in the Brugui{\`e}res, Lack, and
Virelizier sense -- with a special kind of mixed distributive law over the
monoidal coalgebra modality. As our main result, we show that the linear
category structure lifts to the category of algebras of $\mathsf{MELL}$ lifting
monads. We explain how groups in the category of coalgebras of the monoidal
coalgebra modality induce $\mathsf{MELL}$ lifting monads and provide a source
for such groups from enrichment over abelian groups. Along the way we also
define mixed distributive laws of symmetric comonoidal monads over symmetric
monoidal comonads and lifting differential category structure.

do that, NB-IoT introduces transmission repetitions and different bandwidth
allocation configurations in uplink. These new transmission approaches yield
many transmission options in uplink. In this paper, we propose analytical

Metamorphic testing is a testing technique to alleviate the oracle problem

one magnetoelectric mechanism, but cover multiple branches of improper

ferroelectric, as well as electronic ferroelectric driven by charge ordering.
In this sense, these iron-based improper ferroelectrics can be an encyclopaedic
playground to explore the comprehensive physics of multiferroics and
magnetoelectricity. Furthermore, the unique characteristics of iron's $3d$
orbitals make some of their magnetoelectric properties quite prominent,
comparing with the extensively-studied Mn-based improper multiferroics. In
addition, these materials establish the crossover between multiferroics and
other fields of functional materials, which enlarges the application scope of
multiferroics.

considered on hypergraphs (which has been refined in a recent JACM 2018 paper)
to define a Laplacian operator, whose spectral properties satisfy the
celebrated Cheeger's inequality. However, one peculiar aspect of this diffusion
process is that each hyperedge directs flow only from vertices with the maximum
density to those with the minimum density, while ignoring vertices having
strict in-beween densities. In this work, we consider a generalized diffusion
process, in which vertices in a hyperedge can act as mediators to receive flow
from vertices with maximum density and deliver flow to those with minimum
density. We show that the resulting Laplacian operator still has a second
eigenvalue satsifying the Cheeger's inequality. Our generalized diffusion model
shows that there is a family of operators whose spectral properties are related
to hypergraph conductance, and provides a powerful tool to enhance the
development of spectral hypergraph theory. Moreover, since every vertex can
participate in the new diffusion model at every instant, this can potentially
have wider practical applications.

classes may spatially vary due to intrinsic component fluctuations or external
factors (illumination). These redundant multiple endmember spectra within each
class adversely affect the performance of unmixing methods. This paper proposes
a mixing model that explicitly incorporates a hierarchical structure of
redundant multiple spectra representing each class. The proposed method is
designed to promote sparsity on the selection of both spectra and classes
within each pixel. The resulting unmixing algorithm is able to adaptively
recover several bundles of endmember spectra associated with each class and
robustly estimate abundances. In addition, its flexibility allows a variable
number of classes to be present within each pixel of the hyperspectral image to
be unmixed. The proposed method is compared with other state-of-the-art

problems in cosmology at present. In last twenty years, cosmological
observations related to SNIa, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations etc, have put stringent constraints on the the dark
energy evolution, still there is enough uncertainty in our knowledge about dark
energy that demands new generation of cosmological observations.
Post-reionization neutral hydrogen 21 cm intensity mapping surveys are one of
the most promising future cosmological observations that have the potential to
map the cosmological evolution from dark ages till present time with
unprecedented accuracy and Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is one of the most
sensitive instruments to measure the post-reionization 21 cm signal. In this
work, we study the future dark energy constraints using post-reionization 21 cm
intensity mapping power spectra with SKA1-mid specifications. We use three
different parametrizations for dark energy equation of state (EoS) including
the widely used CPL one. To generate simulated data, we use to two fiducial
models: the concordance $\Lambda$CDM and the best fit CPL model for
Planck+SNIa+BAO+HST. Our study shows that SKA1-mid alone has the potential to
reach the present accuracy for combined Planck+SNIa+BAO+HST to constrain the
dark energy behaviour. Whether dark energy is phantom or non-phantom or whether
it exhibits phantom crossing, we may potentially address such questions with
SKA1-mid. We also show that it is crucial to choose the correct parametrization
for dark energy equation of state as some parametrizations are better than
others to constrain the dark energy behaviour. Specifically, as observed in
this study, the widely used CPL parametrization may not give the best
constraint for dark energy behaviour.

Lie-Poisson system is derived from the framework of geometric mechanics, which
generalises the classical Heisenberg model studied in statistical mechanics. We
considered two ways of coupling the spins: one via the momentum and the other
via the position and studied in details the equilibrium solutions and their
corresponding nonlinear stability properties using the energy-Casimir method.
We then took the example $G=SO(3)$ and saw that the momentum-coupled system
reduces to the classical Heisenberg model with massive spins and the
position-coupled case reduces to a new system that has a broken symmetry group
$SO(3)/SO(2)$ similar to the heavy top. In the latter system, we numerically
observed an interesting synchronisation-like phenomenon for a certain class of
initial conditions. Adding a type of noise and dissipation that preserves the
coadjoint orbit of the network model, we found that the invariant measure is
given by the Gibbs measure, from which the notion of temperature is defined. We
then observed a surprising `triple-humped' phase transition in the heavy
top-like lattice model, where the spins switched from one equilibrium position
to another before losing magnetisation as we increased the temperature. This
work is only a first step towards connecting geometric mechanics with
statistical mechanics and several interesting problems are open for further
investigation.

giants in eclipsing binary systems. We present the first detailed analysis of
individual oscillation modes of the red-giant components of KIC 8410637,
KIC5640750 and KIC9540226. We obtain estimates of their asteroseismic masses,
radii, mean densities and logarithmic surface gravities by using the
asteroseismic scaling relations as well as grid-based modelling. As these red
giants are in double-lined eclipsing binaries, it is possible to derive their
independent dynamical masses and radii from the orbital solution and compare it
with the seismically inferred values. For KIC 5640750 we compute the first
spectroscopic orbit based on both components of this system. We use
high-resolution spectroscopic data and light curves of the three systems to

solar-like oscillators on the red giant branch (RGB). Fitting stellar models to
these mode frequencies, however, is more difficult than in main-sequence stars.
This is partly because of the uncertain magnitude of the surface effect: the
systematic difference between observed and modelled frequencies caused by poor
modelling of the near-surface layers. We aim to study the magnitude of the
surface effect in RGB stars. Surface effect corrections used for main-sequence
targets are potentially large enough to put the non-radial mixed modes in RGB
stars out of order, which is unphysical. Unless this can be circumvented,
model-fitting of evolved RGB stars is restricted to the radial modes, which
reduces the number of available modes. Here, we present a method to suppress
gravity modes (g-modes) in the cores of our stellar models, so that they have
only pure pressure modes (p-modes). We show that the method gives unbiased
results and apply it to three RGB solar-like oscillators in double-lined
eclipsing binaries: KIC 8410637, KIC 9540226 and KIC 5640750. In all three
stars, the surface effect decreases the model frequencies consistently by about
0.1--0.3 $\mu$Hz at the frequency of maximum oscillation power
$\nu_\mathrm{max}$, which agrees with existing predictions from
three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. Though our method in
essence discards information about the stellar cores, it provides a useful step

Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansions for sampling. To reduce the cost we construct a
reduced basis surrogate built from snapshots of Karhunen-Lo\`eve eigenvectors.
In particular, we consider Mat\'ern-type covariance operators with unknown
correlation length and standard deviation. We suggest a linearisation of the
covariance function and describe the associated online-offline decomposition.
In numerical experiments we investigate the approximation error of the reduced
eigenpairs. As an application we consider forward uncertainty propagation and
Bayesian inversion with an elliptic partial differential equation where the
logarithm of the diffusion coefficient is a parameterised Gaussian random
field. In the Bayesian inverse problem we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo on
the reduced space to generate samples from the posterior measure. All numerical
experiments are conducted in 2D physical space, with non-separable covariance
operators, and finite element grids with $\sim 10^4$ degrees of freedom.

standard elementary kernels by training deep networks. This scheme has proven
to be effective, but intractable when handling large-scale datasets especially
when the depth of the trained networks increases; indeed, the complexity of
evaluating these networks scales quadratically w.r.t. the size of training data
and linearly w.r.t. the depth of the trained networks. In this paper, we
address the issue of efficient computation in Deep Kernel Networks (DKNs) by
designing effective maps in the underlying Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces.
Given a pretrained DKN, our method builds its associated Deep Map Network (DMN)
whose inner product approximates the original network while being far more
efficient. The design principle of our method is greedy and achieved
layer-wise, by finding maps that approximate DKNs at different (input,
intermediate and output) layers. This design also considers an extra
fine-tuning step based on unsupervised learning, that further enhances the
generalization ability of the trained DMNs. When plugged into SVMs, these DMNs
turn out to be as accurate as the underlying DKNs while being at least an order
of magnitude faster on large-scale datasets, as shown through extensive
experiments on the challenging ImageCLEF and COREL5k benchmarks.

also causes a combinatorial explosion in the size of the program. Several
methods to overcome this issue have been devised: restricting the constraint
domains (e.g., discrete instead of dense), or the type (or number) of models
that can be returned. In this paper we propose to incorporate constraints into
s(ASP), a goal-directed, top-down execution model which implements ASP while
retaining logical variables both during execution and in the answer sets. The
resulting model, s(CASP), can constrain variables that, as in CLP, are kept
during the execution and in the answer sets. s(CASP) inherits and generalizes
the execution model of s(ASP) and is parametric w.r.t. the constraint solver.
We describe this novel execution model and show through several examples the
enhanced expressiveness of s(CASP) w.r.t. ASP, CLP, and other CASP systems. We
also report improved performance w.r.t. other very mature, highly optimized ASP
systems in some benchmarks. This paper is under consideration for publication

""dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation"" (D^6) scenario is that
the companion WD survives the explosion and is flung away with a velocity equal
to its > 1000 km/s pre-SN orbital velocity. We perform a search for these
hypervelocity runaway WDs using Gaia's second data release. In this paper, we
discuss seven candidates followed up with ground-based instruments. Three
sources are likely to be some of the fastest known stars in the Milky Way, with
total Galactocentric velocities between 1000 and 3000 km/s, and are consistent
with having previously been companion WDs in pre-SN Ia systems. However,
although the radial velocity of one of the stars is > 1000 km/s, the radial
velocities of the other two stars are puzzlingly consistent with 0. The
combined five-parameter astrometric solutions from Gaia and radial velocities
from follow-up spectra yield tentative 6D confirmation of the D^6 scenario. The
past position of one of these stars places it within a faint, old SN remnant,
further strengthening the interpretation of these candidates as hypervelocity
runaways from binary systems that underwent SNe Ia.

related. Scenarios involving a Solar System object, a stellar cluster, dust
enshrouding, and accretion variability have been considered, and discarded, as
the origin of the transient. Although a combination of time-varying strong and
weak lensing effects, induced by an intermediate mass black hole (10$^4$ - 5
$\times$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$) moving within the Milky Way halo (0.1 -- 4 kpc),
can conceivably explain all of the observed variable galaxy properties, it is
statistically highly unlikely according to current theoretical predictions,

supernova/hypernova could have occurred, as long as the event was observed
towards the later/late-stage descent of the light curve, but this scenario
fails to explain the absence of a post-explosion source and/or host HII region

luminous blue variable star, a stellar merger or a nova, observed at, or near,

fruitful exchange across communities. Operational model development is
compelling, driven by factors that broadly fall into four categories: model
skill, basic physics, advances in computer architecture, and new aspects to be
covered, from costumer needs over physics to observational data. Evaluation of
model skill as part of the operational chain goes beyond an automated skill
score. Permanent interaction between 'pure research' and 'operational forecast'
people is beneficial to both sides. This includes joint model development
projects, although ultimate responsibility for the operational code remains
with the forecast provider. The pace of model development reflects operational
lead times. The points are illustrated with selected examples, many of which
reflect the author's background and personal contacts, notably with the Swiss

new theoretical and algorithmic framework to evaluate and reduce the noise
level for PIC simulations based on the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) theory,
which has been widely adopted in machine learning and big data science.
According to this framework, the error on particle density estimation for PIC
simulations can be characterized by the Mean Integrated Square Error (MISE),
which consists of two parts, systematic error and noise. A careful analysis
shows that in the standard PIC methods noise is the dominate error, and the
noise level can be reduced if we select different shape functions that are
capable of balancing the systematic error and the noise. To improve
performance, we use the von Mises distribution as the shape function and seek
an optimal particle width that minimizes the MISE, represented by a
Cross-Validation (CV) function. This procedure significantly reduces both the
noise and the MISE for PIC simulations. A particle-wise width adjustment
algorithm and a width update algorithm are further developed to reduce the
MISE. Simulations using the examples of Langmuir wave and Landau Damping
demonstrate that the KDE algorithm developed in the present study reduces the
noise level on density estimation by 98%, and gives a much more accurate result
on the linear damping rate compared to the standard PIC methods. Meanwhile, it
is computational efficient that can save 40% time to achieve the same accuracy.

reasonably reliable technology. However training effective photo classifiers
typically takes numerous examples which limits image recognition's scalability
and applicability to scenarios where images may not be available. This has
motivated investigation into zero-shot learning, which addresses the issue via
knowledge transfer from other modalities such as text. In this paper we
investigate an alternative approach of synthesizing image classifiers: almost
directly from a user's imagination, via free-hand sketch. This approach doesn't
require the category to be nameable or describable via attributes as per
zero-shot learning. We achieve this via training a {model regression} network
to map from {free-hand sketch} space to the space of photo classifiers. It
turns out that this mapping can be learned in a category-agnostic way, allowing
photo classifiers for new categories to be synthesized by user with no need for
annotated training photos. {We also demonstrate that this modality of
classifier generation can also be used to enhance the granularity of an
existing photo classifier, or as a complement to name-based zero-shot learning.

system, we design a developed opto-mechanical tripartite system in which all
subsystems such as an optical cavity, microresonator, and microcavity modes are
coupled directly to each other. This system is analyzed quantum mechanically,
and its dynamics of motion is studied by the Heisenberg-Langevin equations.
Notably, the originality of this work contributes to embedding the spherical
capacitor in the optical cavity where the plasmon-plasmon interaction between
capacitor plates manipulates the internal electric field. Therefore, using
plasmon-plasmon interaction inside the spherical capacitor, which leads to
nonlinearity, causes the contributed polarization function of the plasmonic
property. Actually, this plasmonic property manages the spherical capacitance.
Although the spherical capacitor is fundamentally dependent on the plasmonic
properties caused by the capacitor gap, the spherical capacitor for a design is
required to be parallel to the microwave capacitor. The system developed in the
present work proved that the stability of the entanglement between optical
cavity and microcavity modes toward the temperature changing is dramatically
increased; which is the original goal of this study. It is worth mentioning
that the environment noise severely restricted the traditional tripartite
system operated with a wide bandwidth, hence the present design can efficiently
fix this issue.

most nodes in a graph have similar distances between them, and which turns out
to be quite standard amongst small-world network models. Modulo reasonable
sparsity assumptions, we are then able to show that a strong form of
idemetricity is actually equivalent to a very weak expander condition (PUMP).
This provides a direct way of providing short proofs that small-world network
models such as the Watts-Strogatz model are strongly idemetric (for a wide
range of parameters), and also provides further evidence that being idemetric
is a common property.
  We then consider how satisfaction of the idemetric property is relevant to
algorithm design. For idemetric graphs we observe, for example, that a single
breadth-first search provides a solution to the all-pairs shortest paths
problem, so long as one is prepared to accept paths which are of stretch close
to 2 with high probability. Since we are able to show that Kleinberg's model is
idemetric, these results contrast nicely with the well known negative results
of Kleinberg concerning efficient decentralised algorithms for finding short
paths: for precisely the same model as Kleinberg's negative results hold, we
are able to show that very efficient (and decentralised) algorithms exist if
one allows for reasonable preprocessing. For deterministic distributed routing
algorithms we are also able to obtain results proving that less routing
information is required for idemetric graphs than the worst case in order to
achieve stretch less than 3 with high probability: while $\Omega(n^2)$ routing
information is required in the worst case for stretch strictly less than 3 on
almost all pairs, for idemetric graphs the total routing information required
is $O(nlog(n))$.

Different crosschecks and analyses using ion potentials obtained from

correlations beyond RPA have a non-negligible effect on the structural

coupling between space-time geometry and the active stress-energy tensor, is
too restricted to allow the existence of gravitational waves in vacuum.
Therefore, said theory can at best be regarded as a wave-less approximation
theory. However, the requirement that the weak-field limit of the contracted
Bianchi identities should be consistent with the Newtonian limit of the local
conservation laws, forbids a full coupling between space-time geometry and the
active stress-energy tensor. Nevertheless, in this paper it is shown how it is
possible to relax the restrictions on quasi-metric space-time geometry
sufficiently to avoid these problems. That is, the original quasi-metric field
equations can be extended with one extra field equation, without having said
full coupling and such that the contracted Bianchi identities have a sensible
Newtonian limit. For weak fields in vacuum, said extra field equation has a
dynamical structure somewhat similar to that of its counterpart in canonical
general relativity (GR). In this way, the prediction of weak GR-like
gravitational waves in vacuum becomes possible. Moreover, exact results from
the original quasi-metric gravitational theory are recovered for metrically
static systems and for isotropic cosmology. This means that the current
experimental status of the extended quasi-metric gravitational theory is the
same as for the original theory, except for the prediction of weak GR-like
gravitational waves in vacuum.

an essential tool for biostratigraphic, evolutionary and
paleoecologic/paleoceanographic studies. To estimate the relative abundance (%)
of a given species, it is necessary to estimate in advance the minimum number
of specimens to be used in the count (n). This requires an a priori assumption
about a specified level of confidence, and about the species population
proportion (p). It is common use to apply the binomial distribution to
determine n to detect the presence of more than one species in the same sample,
although the multinomial distribution should necessarily be used instead.
  The mathematical theory of sample size computation using the multinomial
distribution is adapted to the computation of n for any number of species to be
detected together (K) at any level of confidence. Easy-to-use extensive tables
show n, for a combination of K and p. These tables indicate a large difference
for n between that indicated by the binomial and those by the multinomial
distribution when many species are to be detected simultaneously. Counting only
300 specimens (with 95 % confidence level) or 500 (99 %) is not enough to
detect more than one taxon.
  The reconstructed history of the micro-biosphere may therefore, in many
instances, need to be largely revised. This revision should affect our
understanding of the ecological and evolutionary relationships between the past
changes in the biosphere and the other major reservoirs (hydrosphere, geosphere
and atmosphere). In biostratigraphy and biochronology, using a much larger
sample size, when more than one marker species is to be detected in the

  Using a Prior Bilinear Model",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data-driven respiratory signal extraction from rotational X-ray scans is a
challenge as angular effects overlap with respiration-induced change in the
scene. In this paper, we use the linearity of the X-ray transform to propose a
bilinear model based on a prior 4D scan to separate angular and respiratory
variation. The bilinear estimation process is supported by a B-spline
interpolation using prior knowledge about the trajectory angle. Consequently,
extraction of respiratory features simplifies to a linear problem. Though the
need for a prior 4D CT seems steep, our proposed use-case of driving a
respiratory motion model in radiation therapy usually meets this requirement.
We evaluate on DRRs of 5 patient 4D CTs in a leave-one-phase-out manner and
achieve a mean estimation error of 3.01 % in the gray values for unseen viewing
angles. We further demonstrate suitability of the extracted weights to drive a
motion model for treatments with a continuously rotating gantry.

  Summarization",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The large amount of videos popping up every day, make it more and more
critical that key information within videos can be extracted and understood in
a very short time. Video summarization, the task of finding the smallest subset
of frames, which still conveys the whole story of a given video, is thus of
great significance to improve efficiency of video understanding. We propose a
novel Dilated Temporal Relational Generative Adversarial Network (DTR-GAN) to
achieve frame-level video summarization. Given a video, it selects the set of
key frames, which contain the most meaningful and compact information.
Specifically, DTR-GAN learns a dilated temporal relational generator and a
discriminator with three-player loss in an adversarial manner. A new dilated
temporal relation (DTR) unit is introduced to enhance temporal representation
capturing. The generator uses this unit to effectively exploit global
multi-scale temporal context to select key frames and to complement the
commonly used Bi-LSTM. To ensure that summaries capture enough key video
representation from a global perspective rather than a trivial randomly shorten
sequence, we present a discriminator that learns to enforce both the
information completeness and compactness of summaries via a three-player loss.
The loss includes the generated summary loss, the random summary loss, and the
real summary (ground-truth) loss, which play important roles for better
regularizing the learned model to obtain useful summaries. Comprehensive
experiments on three public datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

simultaneously in both statistical samples without any significant shift over

$5.61$, $3.75$, $2.80$ and $2.24$ minutes. The RHESSI data shows similar

Recently, several adversarial

the problems of reward sparsity and mode collapse. In order to address these
two problems, in this paper, we employ inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for
text generation. Specifically, the IRL framework learns a reward function on
training data, and then an optimal policy to maximum the expected total reward.
Similar to the adversarial models, the reward and policy function in IRL are
optimized alternately. Our method has two advantages: (1) the reward function
can produce more dense reward signals. (2) the generation policy, trained by
""entropy regularized"" policy gradient, encourages to generate more diversified

researchers have drawn conclusions from the derived weight maps. In particular,
weight maps of classifiers between two conditions are often described as a
proxy for the underlying signal differences between the conditions. Recent
studies have however suggested that such weight maps could not reliably recover
the source of the neural signals and even led to false positives (FP). In this
work, we used semi-simulated data from ElectroCorticoGraphy (ECoG) to
investigate how the signal-to-noise ratio and sparsity of the neural signal
affect the similarity between signal and weights. We show that not all cases
produce FP and that it is unlikely for FP features to have a high weight in
most cases.

intensive recent investigations due to numerous potential applications. In this
regard, development of experimental means to understand and control the complex
Fano interference process and to modulate the resulting asymmetric Fano
spectral line shape is highly sought after. Here we present a polarization
Mueller matrix measurement and inverse analysis approach for quantitative
understanding and interpretation of the complex interference process that lead
to Fano resonance in symmetry broken plasmonic oligomers. The spectral Mueller
matrices of the plasmonic oligomers were recorded using a custom designed
dark-field Mueller matrix spectroscopy system. These were subsequently analyzed
using differential Mueller matrix decomposition technique to yield the
quantitative sample polarimetry characteristics, namely, polarization
diattenuation (d) and linear retardance ({\delta}) parameters. The unique
signature of the interference of the superradiant dipolar plasmon mode and the
subradiant quadrupolar mode of the symmetry broken plasmonic oligomers
manifested as rapid spectral variation of the diattenuation and the linear
retardance parameters across the Fano spectral dip. The polarization
information contained in the Mueller matrix was further utilized to desirably
control the Fano spectral line shape. The experimental Mueller matrix analysis
was complemented with finite element based numerical simulations, which enabled
quantitative understanding of the interference of the superradiant and the
subradiant plasmon modes and its link with the polarization diattenuation and
retardance parameters.

  Manager for GPUs",,,,,"cs.OS cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern GPUs face a trade-off on how the page size used for memory management
affects address translation and demand paging. Support for multiple page sizes
can help relax the page size trade-off so that address translation and demand
paging optimizations work together synergistically. However, existing page
coalescing and splintering policies require costly base page migrations that
undermine the benefits multiple page sizes provide. In this paper, we observe
that GPGPU applications present an opportunity to support multiple page sizes
without costly data migration, as the applications perform most of their memory
allocation en masse (i.e., they allocate a large number of base pages at once).
We show that this en masse allocation allows us to create intelligent memory
allocation policies which ensure that base pages that are contiguous in virtual
memory are allocated to contiguous physical memory pages. As a result,
coalescing and splintering operations no longer need to migrate base pages.
  We introduce Mosaic, a GPU memory manager that provides
application-transparent support for multiple page sizes. Mosaic uses base pages
to transfer data over the system I/O bus, and allocates physical memory in a
way that (1) preserves base page contiguity and (2) ensures that a large page
frame contains pages from only a single memory protection domain. This
mechanism allows the TLB to use large pages, reducing address translation
overhead. During data transfer, this mechanism enables the GPU to transfer only
the base pages that are needed by the application over the system I/O bus,
keeping demand paging overhead low.

checkpointing overhead is critical to improving the overall performance of
iterative methods. Our contribution is fourfold. (1) We propose a novel lossy
checkpointing scheme that can significantly improve the checkpointing
performance of iterative methods by leveraging lossy compressors. (2) We
formulate a lossy checkpointing performance model and derive theoretically an
upper bound for the extra number of iterations caused by the distortion of data
in lossy checkpoints, in order to guarantee the performance improvement under
the lossy checkpointing scheme. (3) We analyze the impact of lossy
checkpointing (i.e., extra number of iterations caused by lossy checkpointing

checkpointing scheme with optimal checkpointing intervals on a high-performance

|\mathcal{B}|\} \le \frac{1}{2} \binom{n-1}{k-1}$? We give an affirmative

essentially the best one could hope for, up to a constant factor. The second
problem is a conjecture of Frankl. It states that for $n \ge 3k$, the maximum
diversity of an intersecting family $\mathcal{F} \subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ is
equal to $\binom{n-3}{k-2}$. We are able to find a construction beating the
conjectured bound for $n$ slightly larger than $3k$, which also disproves a

anomalously clustered in physical space has recently prompted the Planet Nine
hypothesis - the proposed existence of a distant and eccentric planetary member
of our solar system. Within the framework of this model, a Neptune-like
perturber sculpts the orbital distribution of distant Kuiper Belt objects
through a complex interplay of resonant and secular effects, such that in
addition to perihelion-circulating objects, the surviving orbits get organized
into apsidally aligned and anti-aligned configurations with respect to Planet
Nine's orbit. In this work, we investigate the role of Kuiper Belt initial
conditions on the evolution of the outer solar system using numerical
simulations. Intriguingly, we find that the final perihelion distance
distribution depends strongly on the primordial state of the system, and
demonstrate that a bimodal structure corresponding to the existence of both
aligned and anti-aligned clusters is only reproduced if the initial perihelion
distribution is assumed to extend well beyond $\sim 36$ AU. The bimodality in
the final perihelion distance distribution is due to the existence of
permanently stable objects, with the lower perihelion peak corresponding to the
anti-aligned orbits and the higher perihelion peak corresponding to the aligned
orbits. We identify the mechanisms which enable the persistent stability of
these objects and locate the regions of phase space in which they reside. The
obtained results contextualize the Planet Nine hypothesis within the broader
narrative of solar system formation, and offer further insight into the

algebraically characterize the whole set of isochrone potentials. Such
potentials are fundamental in potential theory. They appear in spherically
symmetrical systems formed by a large amount of charges (electrical or
gravitational) of the same type considered in mean-field theory. Such
potentials are defined by the fact that the radial period of a test charge in
such potentials, provided that it exists, depends only on its energy and not on
its angular momentum.
  Our characterization of the isochrone set is based on the action of a real
affine subgroup on isochrone potentials related to parabolas in the
$\mathbb{R}^2$ plane. Furthermore, any isochrone orbits are mapped onto
associated Keplerian elliptic ones by a generalization of the Bohlin
transformation. This mapping allows us to understand the isochrony property of
a given potential as relative to the reference frame in which its parabola is
represented. We detail this isochrone relativity in the special relativity
formalism.
  We eventually exploit the completeness of our characterization and the
relativity of isochrony to propose a deeper understanding of general symmetries
such as Kepler's Third Law and Bertrand's theorem.

it is useful to consider the data collected by the sensors in the context of
the location from which they were collected. Thus, one of the major challenges
in WSNs is to determine the coordinates of sensors while minimizing the
hardware cost. To address this, numerous localization algorithms have been
proposed in the literature. However, outcomes of these algorithms are affected
by noise, fading, and interference. As a result, their levels of accuracy may
become unacceptable in complex environments that contain obstacles and
reflecting surfaces. The alternative is to use topological maps based only on
connectivity information. Since they do not contain information about physical
distances, however, they are not faithful representatives of the physical
layout. Thus, the primary goal of this research is to discover a topology map
that provides more accurate information about physical layouts. In doing so,
this research has resulted in four main contributions. First, a novel concept
Maximum-Likelihood Topology Map for RF WSNs is presented. This topology map
provides a more accurate physical representation, by using the probability of
packet reception. The second contribution is Millimetre wave Topology Map
calculation, which is a novel topology mapping algorithm based on maximum
likelihood estimation for millimetre wave WSNs. The third contribution is a
distributed algorithm being proposed to calculate the topology coordinates of
sensors by themselves as two algorithms above calculate centrally, which
requires time. Since a topology map contains significant non-linear
distortions, two WSN applications i.e. target searching and extremum seeking,
which use a proposed topology map to localize the sensors and perform its
specified task are presented as the final contribution of this dissertation.

systems with short-range interactions the heat exhibits universal power-law
scaling as a function of the quench rate, known as Kibble-Zurek scaling. In
this work we analyze slow quenches of the magnetic field in the
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, which describes fully connected quantum
spins. We analytically determine the quantum contribution to the residual heat
as a function of the quench rate $\delta$ by means of a Holstein-Primakoff
expansion about the mean-field value. Unlike in the case of short-range
interactions, scaling laws in the LMG model are only found for a ramp ending at
the critical point. If instead the ramp is symmetric, as in the typical
Kibble-Zurek scenario, after crossing the critical point the system tends to
reabsorb the defects formed during the first part of the ramp: the number of
excitations exhibits a crossover behavior as a function of $\delta$ and tends
to a constant in the thermodynamic limit. Previous, and seemingly
contradictory, theoretical studies are identified as specific limits of this
dynamics. Our results can be tested on several experimental platforms,
including quantum gases and trapped ions.

density functional theory. First we analyze quantum zero-point
spin-fluctuations (ZPSF) as calculated from the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem, and show how they affect the magnetic stability by modifying the
magnetic anisotropy energy. We also assess the impact of ZPSF in the limit of
small hybridization to the substrate characteristic of semi-insulating
substrates, connecting to recent experimental investigations where magnetic
stability of a single adatom was achieved for the first time. Secondly, we
inspect further the dynamics of single adatoms by considering the longitudinal
and transverse spin-relaxation processes, whose time-scales are analyzed and
related to the underlying electronic structure of both the adatom and the
substrate. Thirdly, we analyze spin-fluctuation modes of paramagnetic adatoms,
i.e., adatoms where the Stoner criterion for magnetism is almost fulfilled.
Interestingly, such modes can develop well-defined peaks in the meV range,
their main characteristics being determined by two fundamental electronic
properties, namely the Stoner parameter and the density of states at the Fermi
level. Furthermore, simulated inelastic scanning tunneling spectroscopy curves
reveal that these spin-fluctuation modes can be triggered by tunneling
electrons, opening up potential applications also for paramagnetic adatoms.
Lastly, an overview of the outstanding issues and future directions is given.

in order to mimic the typical sizes of a blood cell (e.g., red cells have the
diameter around 7 {\mu}m). Whilst with present state-of-the-art in CMOS
technology, this requirement in terms of size is currently un-feasible, recent
research has advanced technology such that we can begin to work towards such an

devices has an inverse functionality of transistors, and is suggested to be
called trancitor rather than transistor because it directly transfers an input
signal into a voltage output. It is expected that a trancitor coupled with a
transistor can provide a minimal circuit configuration, i.e., low circuit
complexity, helping virtually to meet the Moore's law. And this may also lead
to a lower power-consumption and higher speed of circuits compared to a
transistor-only circuit. These are supported with a circuit simulation and
simple Tetris-like block analysis. In this regards, in the future, it should be
required to find a trancitor to be another foundation of electronics along with

Accretion brings together disparate parts to form bigger wholes. Change
provides opportunities for growth and innovation. Here we review patterns and
processes that are responsible for a 'double tale' of evolutionary accretion at
various levels of complexity, from proteins and nucleic acids to high-rise
building structures in cities. Parts are at first weakly linked and associate
variously. As they diversify, they compete with each other and are selected for
performance. The emerging interactions constrain their structure and
associations. This causes parts to self-organize into modules with tight
linkage. In a second phase, variants of the modules evolve and become new parts
for a new generative cycle of higher-level organization. Evolutionary genomics
and network biology support the 'double tale' of structural module creation and
validate an evolutionary principle of maximum abundance that drives the gain
and loss of modules.

over-the-counter (OTC) financial derivatives is a formidable challenge. Due to
the regulatory framework and the scale of financial risk if a contract were to
go wrong, the performance of these contracts must be enforceable in law and
there is an absolute requirement that the smart contract will be faithful to
the intentions of the parties as expressed in the original legal documentation.
Formal methods provide an attractive route for validation and assurance, and
here we present early results from an investigation of the semantics of
industry-standard legal documentation for OTC derivatives. We explain the need
for a formal representation that combines temporal, deontic and operational
aspects, and focus on the requirements for the temporal aspects as derived from
the legal text. The relevance of this work extends beyond OTC derivatives and
is applicable to understanding the temporal semantics of a wide range of legal
documentation.

functions, convey useful information. However, most existing bug detection
tools ignore this information and therefore miss some classes of bugs. The few
existing name-based bug detection approaches reason about names on a syntactic
level and rely on manually designed and tuned algorithms to detect bugs. This
paper presents DeepBugs, a learning approach to name-based bug detection, which
reasons about names based on a semantic representation and which automatically
learns bug detectors instead of manually writing them. We formulate bug
detection as a binary classification problem and train a classifier that
distinguishes correct from incorrect code. To address the challenge that
effectively learning a bug detector requires examples of both correct and
incorrect code, we create likely incorrect code examples from an existing
corpus of code through simple code transformations. A novel insight learned
from our work is that learning from artificially seeded bugs yields bug
detectors that are effective at finding bugs in real-world code. We implement
our idea into a framework for learning-based and name-based bug detection.
Three bug detectors built on top of the framework detect accidentally swapped
function arguments, incorrect binary operators, and incorrect operands in
binary operations. Applying the approach to a corpus of 150,000 JavaScript
files yields bug detectors that have a high accuracy (between 89% and 95%), are
very efficient (less than 20 milliseconds per analyzed file), and reveal 102
programming mistakes (with 68% true positive rate) in real-world code.
