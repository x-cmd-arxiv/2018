resolution is an important diagnostic of the Sun's atmosphere and magnetism at
small spatial scales. At present, spatially resolved observations of this
diagnostic are rare and have not been reported as close to the disk center as
for $\mu=0.6$. Our aim is to measure the scattering polarization in the Sr I
line at $\mu=0.6$ and to identify the spatial fluctuations with a statistical
approach. Using the Fast Solar Polarimeter (FSP) mounted on the TESOS
filtergraph at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) in Tenerife, Spain, we
measured both the spatially resolved full Stokes parameters of the Sr I line at
$\mu=0.6$ and the center-to-limb variation of the spatially averaged Stokes
parameters.
  We find that the center-to-limb variation of the scattering polarization in
the Sr I line measured with FSP is consistent with previous measurements. A
statistical analysis of Stokes $Q/I$ (i.e., the linear polarization component
parallel to the solar limb), sampled with $0.16$"" pixel$^{-1}$ in the line core
of Sr I reveals that the signal strength is inversely correlated with the
intensity in the continuum. We find stronger linear polarimetric signals
corresponding to dark areas (intergranular lanes) in the Stokes $I$ continuum
image. In contrast, independent measurements at $\mu=0.3$ show a positive
correlation of $Q/I$ with respect to the continuum intensity. We estimate that
the patch diameter responsible for the excess $Q/I$ signal is on the order of
$0.5$""-$1$"". The presented observations and the statistical analysis of $Q$/$I$
signals at $\mu=0.6$ complement reported scattering polarization observations
as well as simulations.

Amputees often cite difficulty of use as a key contributing factor for
abandoning their prosthesis, creating a pressing need for improved control
technology. A major challenge of traditional myoelectric control strategies
using surface electromyography electrodes has been the difficulty in achieving
intuitive and robust proportional control of multiple degrees of freedom. In
this paper, we describe a new control method, proprioceptive sonomyographic
control that overcomes several limitations of myoelectric control. In
sonomyography, muscle mechanical deformation is sensed using ultrasound, as
compared to electrical activation, and therefore the resulting control signals
can directly control the position of the end effector. Compared to myoelectric
control which controls the velocity of the end-effector device, sonomyographic
control is more congruent with residual proprioception in the residual limb. We
tested our approach with 5 upper-extremity amputees and able-bodied subjects
using a virtual target achievement and holding task. Amputees and able-bodied
participants demonstrated the ability to achieve positional control for 5
degrees of freedom with an hour of training. Our results demonstrate the
potential of proprioceptive sonomyographic control for intuitive dexterous
control of multiarticulated prostheses.

Two-dimensional semiconductors integrated with optical cavities are emerging as
a promising platform for studying strong light-matter interactions as a route
to explore a variety of exotic many-body effects. Here, in few-layered WS2
coupled with plasmonic nanoparticle lattices, we observe the formation of a
collective polaritonic mode near the exciton energy and the formation of a
complete polariton band gap with energy scale comparable to the exciton-plasmon
coupling strength. A coupled oscillator model reveals that the collective mode
arises from the cooperative coupling of the excitons to the plasmonic lattice
diffraction orders via exciton-exciton interactions. The emergence of the
collective mode is accompanied by a superlinear increase of the polariton mode
splitting as a function of the square root of the exciton oscillator strength.
The presence of these many body effects, which are enhanced in systems which
lack bulk polarization, not only allows the formation of a collective mode with
periodically varying field profiles, but also further enhances the
exciton-plasmon coupling. By integrating the hybrid WS2-plasmonic lattice
device with a field-effect transistor, we demonstrate active tuning of the
collective mode and the polariton band gap. These systems provide new
opportunities for obtaining a deeper and systematic understanding of many body
cooperative phenomena in periodic photonic systems and for designing more

polariton lasers, waveguides, and optical logical elements.

performance on simultaneous clustering and optimization. However, it usually
suffers from the imperfect data (noise, missing values etc), and yields
sub-optimal solutions. The reason is that it finds the similar instances
according to their features directly, which is usually impacted by the
imperfect data, and thus returns sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose
triangle lasso to avoid its disadvantage. Triangle lasso finds the similar
instances according to their neighbours. If two instances have many common
neighbours, they tend to become similar. Although some instances are profiled
by the imperfect data, it is still able to find the similar counterparts.
Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm based on Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to obtain a moderately accurate solution. In
addition, we present a dual method to obtain the accurate solution with the low
additional time consumption. We demonstrate through extensive numerical
experiments that triangle lasso is robust to the imperfect data. It usually
yields a better performance than the state-of-the-art method when performing
data analysis tasks in practical scenarios.

  sheaves, otherwise minor changes in response to referee report",,,,"math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new algorithm for the structural analysis of finite abstract
simplicial complexes based on local homology. Through an iterative and top-down
procedure, our algorithm computes a stratification $\pi$ of the poset $P$ of
simplices of a simplicial complex $K$, such that for each strata $P_{\pi=i}
\subset P$, $P_{\pi=i}$ is maximal among all open subposets $U \subset
\overline{P_{\pi=i}}$ in its closure such that the restriction of the local
$\mathbb{Z}$-homology sheaf of $\overline{P_{\pi=i}}$ to $U$ is locally
constant. Passage to the localization of $P$ dictated by $\pi$ then attaches a
canonical stratified homotopy type to $K$.
  Using $\infty$-categorical methods, we first prove that the proposed
algorithm correctly computes the canonical stratification of a simplicial
complex; along the way, we prove a few general results about sheaves on posets
and the homotopy types of links that may be of independent interest. We then
present a pseudocode implementation of the algorithm, with special focus given
to the case of dimension $\leq 3$, and show that it runs in polynomial time. In
particular, an $n$-dimensional simplicial complex with size $s$ and $n\leq3$
can be processed in O($s^2$) time or O($s$) given one further assumption on the
structure. Processing Delaunay triangulations of $2$-spheres and $3$-balls
provides experimental confirmation of this linear running time.

hand-crafting features is burdensome. In this paper, we take a third approach,
proposing Consensus Networks (CNs), a framework to classify after reaching
agreements between modalities. We divide linguistic features into
non-overlapping subsets according to their modalities, and let neural networks
learn low-dimensional representations that agree with each other. These
representations are passed into a classifier network. All neural networks are
optimized iteratively.
  In this paper, we also present two methods that improve the performance of
CNs. We then present ablation studies to illustrate the effectiveness of
modality division. To understand further what happens in CNs, we visualize the
representations during training. Overall, using all of the 413 linguistic
features, our models significantly outperform traditional classifiers, which
are used by the state-of-the-art papers.

during a tetanic stimulus, but paradoxically, L-LTP is not blocked when
synthesis and degradation are inhibited simultaneously, suggesting
counter-acting positive and negative proteins regulate L-LTP. To investigate
this paradox, we modeled LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapse. Nine
differential equations describe the levels of positive and negative regulator
proteins (PP and NP) and transitions among five discrete synaptic states, a
basal state (BAS), three E-LTP states (EP1, EP2, ED), and a L-LTP state (LP). A
stimulus initiates the transition from BAS to EP1 and from EP1 to EP2,
initiates the synthesis of PP and NP, and activates the ubiquitin-proteasome
system (UPS). UPS mediates transitions of EP1 and EP2 to ED and the degradation
of NP. The conversion of E-LTP to L-LTP is mediated by a PP-dependent
transition from ED to LP. NP mediates reversal of EP2 to BAS. This model
simulates empirical observations: 1) normal L-LTP, 2) block by either
proteasome inhibitor or protein synthesis inhibitor alone, and 3) preservation
of L-LTP when both inhibitors are applied together. Elements of this abstract
model can be correlated with specific molecules and processes. Moreover, the
model makes testable predictions, such as a unique synaptic state ED that
precedes the transition to L-LTP, and a time window for the action of the UPS
(during the transitions from EP1 and EP2 to ED). Tests of these predictions
will provide insights into the processes of long-term synaptic plasticity.

the closed-form expression of the price charged by the MNO for every user is
derived and the problem of spectrum allocation is formulated as a matching game
with incomplete information. For the matching problem, a distributed algorithm
is proposed to assign the users to the licensed and unlicensed spectra.
Simulation results show that the proposed pricing mechanism can increase the

classical algorithms that do not account for users requirements. Moreover, the
performance of the proposed algorithm in the case of incomplete information is
shown to approach the performance of the same mechanism with complete

involves two probabilistic models. The first models which movies the users
watch; it provides a substitute for the unobserved confounders. The second one
models how each user rates each movie; it employs the substitute to help

to non-interacting leads. The properties of this setup depend essentially on
the ratio $p$ between the number of transverse modes in the lead $M$ and the
number of the fermion degrees of freedom $N$ on the SYK dot. This ratio can be
tuned via the magnetic field applied to the dot. Our proposed setup gives
access to the non-trivial conformal-invariant regime associated with the SYK

The dimensionless linear response conductance acquires distinct $\sqrt{p}$ and

corrections scale linearly and quadratically in either temperature or frequency

differential conductance proportional to the inverse square root of the applied
voltage bias $U$. This dependence is replaced by a conventional Ohmic behavior

Supervised methods require large amounts of depth measurement data, which are

possible solution for collecting large amounts of depth data. However, the
large domain gaps between synthetic and realistic data make directly training

Cross-domain synthetic data could be fully utilized in this novel framework.

in terminal wind velocity around spectral type B1 is confirmed by the Monte
Carlo method -- at the correct effective temperature of about 21 000 K. This
drop in wind velocity is much steeper than would be expected from the drop in
escape speed for cooler stars. The results may be particularly relevant for
slow winds inferred for some High-Mass X-ray binaries. Second, the strength of
the mass-loss bi-stability jump is found to be significantly larger than
previously assumed. Not only could this make bi-stability braking more
efficient in massive star evolution, but a rotationally-induced version of the
bi-stability mechanism may now be capable of producing the correct density of
outflowing disks around B[e] supergiants, although multi-dimensional modelling
including the disk velocity structure is still needed. For LBVs, we find the
bi-stability jump to become larger at higher metallicities, but perhaps
surprisingly also larger at lower Eddington parameters. This may have
consequences for the role of LBVs in the evolution of massive stars at
different metallicities and Cosmic Epochs. Finally, our predicted low wind

comparison, we have also explored the evolution of supernova remnants in the
diffuse ISM with constant density. Since the hydrodynamics of SNRs is
intimately related to the properties of their immediate environment, the
lifecycle of dust grains in SNRs within SSCs is radically different from that
in the diffuse ISM. Moreover, off-centered SNRs evolving in the steep density
gradient established due to a star cluster wind experience a blowout phase:
shell fragmentation due to protruding Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and the
venting of SN ejecta. Our main finding is that clustered SN explosions will
cause a net increase in the amount of dust in the surroundings of young massive
stellar clusters. Our analysis considers the multiple dust processing resulting
from the passage of the SN reverse shock, including its reflection at the SNR's
center, the injection of shocked stellar winds within the respective remnant's
volume and the effect of secondary forward shocks produced in sequential SN
explosions. In the simulations, we have on-the-fly calculated the rates of
thermal sputtering and dust-induced radiative cooling provided an initial
distribution of grain sizes and dust content. Fast-moving elongated dusty SN
ejecta resemble mushroom clouds violently ascending in a stratified atmosphere

describes the appearance of an additional electric current along a magnetic
field. It is caused by an asymmetry between the number densities of left- and
right-handed fermions, which can be maintained at high energies when the
chirality flipping rate can be neglected, for example in the early Universe.
The inclusion of the CME in the Maxwell equations leads to a modified set of
MHD equations. We discuss how the CME is implemented in the PENCIL CODE. The
CME plays a key role in the evolution of magnetic fields since it results in a
dynamo effect associated with an additional term in the induction equation.
This term is formally similar to the $\alpha$ effect in classical mean-field
MHD. However, the chiral dynamo can operate without turbulence and is
associated with small spatial scales that can be, in the case of the early
Universe, orders of magnitude below the Hubble radius. A chiral $\alpha_\mu$
effect has also been identified in mean-field theory. It occurs in the presence
of turbulence but is not related to kinetic helicity. Depending on the plasma
parameters, chiral dynamo instabilities can amplify magnetic fields over many
orders of magnitude. These instabilities can affect the propagation of MHD
waves, which is demonstrated by our DNS. We also study the coupling between the
evolution of the chiral chemical potential and the ordinary chemical potential,
which is proportional to the sum of the number densities of left- and
right-handed fermions. An important consequence of this coupling is the
emergence of chiral magnetic waves (CMWs). We confirm numerically that linear
CMWs and MHD waves are not interacting. Our simulations suggest that the
chemical potential has only a minor effect on the non-linear evolution of the
chiral dynamo.

($L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 1$) and 1H 0707--495 ($L/L_{\rm Edd}\gtrsim 10$). The
observed lag timescales correspond to very short distances of several $R_g/c$,
so that they have been used to argue for extremely small `lamp-post' coronae
close to the event horizon of rapidly spinning black holes. Here we show for
the first time that these Fe-K short lags are more likely to arise from
scattering in a highly-ionised wind, launched at $\sim 50\,R_g$, rotating and
outflowing with a typical velocity of $0.2c$. We show that this model can
simultaneously fit the time-averaged energy spectra and the short-timescale
lag-energy spectra of both 1H 0707--495 and Ark 564. The Fe-K line in 1H
0707--495 has a strong P-Cygni-like profile, which requires that the wind solid
angle is large and that our line of sight intercepts the wind. By contrast the
lack of an absorption line in the energy spectrum of Ark 564 requires rather

(R-CRNN) for audio event detection (AED). The proposed network is inspired by
Faster-RCNN, a well known region-based convolutional network framework for
visual object detection. Different from the original Faster-RCNN, a recurrent
layer is added on top of the convolutional network to capture the long-term
temporal context from the extracted high level features. While most of the
previous works on AED generate predictions at frame level first, and then use
post-processing to predict the onset/offset timestamps of events from a
probability sequence; the proposed method generates predictions at event level
directly and can be trained end-to-end with a multitask loss, which optimizes
the classification and localization of audio events simultaneously. The
proposed method is tested on DCASE 2017 Challenge dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, R-CRNN is the best performing single-model method among all methods
without using ensembles both on development and evaluation sets. Compared to
the other region-based network for AED (R-FCN) with an event-based error rate
(ER) of 0.18 on the development set, our method reduced the ER to half.

safety of autonomous vehicles co-existing with human-driven vehicles. Motivated
by this we address the design of provably safe intersection management for
mixed traffic consisting of a mix of human-driven vehicles (HVs) as well as
autonomous vehicles (AVs).
  To analyze such mixed traffic, we model HVs as nearsighted and with
relatively loose constraints, permitting worst-case behavior while AVs are
considered as capable of following much tighter constraints. HVs are allowed
freedom to change their speed at any time while AVs are only allowed to change
their speed beginning of a time slot through a Model Predictive Controller
(MPC). AVs are assumed to possess a shorter response time and stronger braking
capability than HVs in collision avoidance. Moreover, AVs obtain the
permissions of passing through the intersection through
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, while HVs achieve the same
objective by following traffic lights.
  Taking the above differences into consideration, we propose a provably safe
intersection management for mixed traffic comprised of an MPC-based protocol
for AVs along with a coordination protocol for traffic lights...

to create gaps in the spectrum of graphene systems is to form long period moire
patterns by aligning the graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrate
lattices. Here, we use planar tunneling devices with thin h-BN barriers to
obtain direct and accurate tunneling spectroscopy measurements of the energy
gaps in single- and bi-layer graphene-h-BN superlattice structures at charge
neutrality (first Dirac point) and at integer moire band occupancies (second
Dirac point, SDP) as a function of external electric and magnetic fields and
the interface twist angle. In single-layer graphene we find, in agreement with
previous work, that gaps are formed at neutrality and at the hole-doped SDP,
but not at the electron-doped SDP. Both primary and secondary gaps can be
determined accurately by extrapolating Landau fan patterns to zero magnetic
field and are as large as $\simeq$ 17 meV for devices in near perfect
alignment. For bilayer graphene, we find that gaps occur only at charge
neutrality where they can be modified by an external electric field. Tunneling
signatures of in-gap states around neutrality suggest the development of edge
modes related to topologically non-trivial valley projected bands due to the
combination of an external electric field and moire superlattice patterns.

kinematically 'heat up' dark matter at the centres of dwarf galaxies. A key
prediction of such models is that, at a fixed dark matter halo mass, dwarfs
with a higher stellar mass will have a lower central dark matter density. We
use stellar kinematics and HI gas rotation curves to infer the inner dark
matter densities of eight dwarf spheroidal and eight dwarf irregular galaxies
with a wide range of star formation histories. For all galaxies, we estimate
the dark matter density at a common radius of 150pc, $\rho_{\rm
DM}(150\,\mathrm{pc})$. We find that our sample of dwarfs falls into two
distinct classes. Those that stopped forming stars over 6Gyrs ago favour
central densities $\rho_{\rm DM}(150\,\mathrm{pc})>10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm
kpc}^{-3}$, consistent with cold dark matter cusps, while those with more
extended star formation favour $\rho_{\rm DM}(150\,\mathrm{pc})<10^8\,{\rm

abundance matching to infer pre-infall halo masses, $M_{200}$, we show that
this dichotomy is in excellent agreement with models in which dark matter is
heated up by bursty star formation. In particular, we find that $\rho_{\rm
DM}(150\,\mathrm{pc})$ steadily decreases with increasing stellar mass-to-halo
mass ratio, $M_*/M_{200}$. Our results suggest that, to leading order, dark
matter is a cold, collisionless, fluid that can be kinematically 'heated up'

gaps in single-crystalline lithium-intercalated layered nitrides (LixHfNCl and

chemical sensing and biomedical diagnostics, requiring only milliseconds of
acquisition time to record absorption spectra without any moving parts. They
are electrically pumped and have a small footprint, making them an ideal
platform for on-chip integration. Until now, optical feedback is fatal for
frequency comb generation in QCLs and destroys intermodal coherence. This
property imposes strict limits on the possible degree of integration. Here, we
demonstrate coherent injection locking of the repetition frequency to a
stabilized RF oscillator. For the first time, we prove that the spectrum of the
injection locked QCL can be phase-locked, resulting in the generation of a
frequency comb. We show that injection locking is not only a versatile tool for
all-electrical frequency stabilization, but also mitigates the fatal effect of
optical feedback on the frequency comb. A prototype self-detected dual-comb
setup consisting only of an injection locked dual-comb chip, a lens and a
mirror demonstrates the enormous potential for on-chip dual-comb spectroscopy.
These results pave the way to miniaturized and all-solid-state mid-infrared

multiple benefits like content which is easy to parse and efficient

sources and use the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) 350 MHz receiver to recover
source positions within $\approx$1$-$3' of their true values, compared to an
18' error radius for new discoveries. Achieving similar precision with a
traditional gridding strategy using the GBT requires 2$-$3 times as much
telescope time (including overhead), multiple receivers and relies on
assumptions about the pulsars' spectral indices. For one of our test sources
(PSR J1400$-$1431), this method revealed a discrepancy with the initial,
published position, prompting additional follow-up and an improved timing
solution. Rapid localization is important for improving data quality and
providing flexibility in choice of center frequency for future timing

orbital angular momentum, can unlock rich phenomena at interfaces, in
particular interconverting spin and charge currents. Conventional heavy metals
have been extensively explored due to their strong SOC of conduction electrons.
However, spin-orbit effects in classes of materials such as epitaxial
5d-electron transition metal complex oxides, which also host strong SOC, remain
largely unreported. In addition to strong SOC, these complex oxides can also
provide the additional tuning knob of epitaxy to control the electronic
structure and the engineering of spin-to-charge conversion by crystalline
symmetry. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature generation of spin-orbit torque
on a ferromagnet with extremely high efficiency via the spin-Hall effect in
epitaxial metastable perovskite SrIrO3. We first predict a large intrinsic
spin-Hall conductivity in orthorhombic bulk SrIrO3 arising from the Berry
curvature in the electronic band structure. By manipulating the intricate
interplay between SOC and crystalline symmetry, we control the spin-Hall torque
ratio by engineering the tilt of the corner-sharing oxygen octahedra in
perovskite SrIrO3 through epitaxial strain. This allows the presence of an
anisotropic spin-Hall effect due to a characteristic structural anisotropy in
SrIrO3 with orthorhombic symmetry. Our experimental findings demonstrate the
heteroepitaxial symmetry design approach to engineer spin-orbit effects. We
therefore anticipate that these epitaxial 5d transition-metal oxide thin films
can be an ideal building block for low-power spintronics.

sensors for information gathering tasks. In ergodic control, a mobile sensor
follows a trajectory that is ergodic with respect to some information density
distribution. A trajectory is ergodic if time spent in a state space region is
proportional to the information density of the region. Although ergodic control
has shown promising experimental results, there is little understanding of why
it works or when it is optimal. In this paper, we study a problem class under
which optimal information gathering trajectories are ergodic. This class relies
on a submodularity assumption for repeated measurements from the same state. It
is assumed that information available in a region decays linearly with time
spent there. This assumption informs selection of the horizon used in ergodic
trajectory generation. We support our claims with a set of experiments that
demonstrate the link between ergodicity, optimal information gathering, and
submodularity.

  A crucial ingredient in our proof is a quasi-polynomial sparsity bound for

show if $f$ is an $s$-sparse polynomial in $n$ variables, with individual
degrees of its variables bounded by $d$, then the sparsity of each factor of
$f$ is bounded by $s^{O({d^2\log{n}})}$. This is the first nontrivial bound on

semiconductor substrate has been shown to change the dynamics of the electronic
states in graphene, inducing spin orbit coupling (SOC) and staggered potential
effects. Theoretical studies on commensurate supercells have demonstrated the
appearance of interesting phases, as different materials and relative gate
voltages are applied. Here we address the effects of the real
incommensurability between lattices by implementing a continuum model approach
that does not require small-period supercells. The approach allows us to study
the role of possible relative twists of the layers, and verify that the SOC
transfer is robust to twists, in agreement with observations. We characterize
the nature of the different phases by studying an effective Hamiltonian that
fully describes the graphene-TMD heterostructure. We find the system supports
topologically non-trivial phases over a wide range of parameter ranges, which
require the dominance of the intrinsic SOC over the staggered and Rashba
potentials. This tantalizing result suggests the possible experimental
realization of a tunable quantum spin Hall phase under suitable conditions. We
estimate that most TMDs used to date likely result in weak intrinsic SOC that
would not drive the heterostructure into topologically non-trivial phases.

to its own boundaries. Evidence shows, however, that software ecosystems
co-evolve independently with other software ecosystems. In other words,
understanding the evolution of a software ecosystem requires an especially
astute awareness of its competitive landscape and much consideration for other
software ecosystems in related markets. A software ecosystem does not evolve in
insulation but with other software ecosystems. In this research, we analyzed
the OpenStack software ecosystem with a focal perspective that attempted to
understand its evolution as a function of other software ecosystems. We
attempted to understand and explain the evolution of OpenStack in relation to
other software ecosystems in the cloud computing market. Our findings add to
theoretical knowledge in software ecosystems by identifying and discussing
seven different mechanisms by which software ecosystems mutually influence each
other: sedimentation and embeddedness of business relationships, strategic
management of the portfolio of business relationships, firms values and
reputation as a partner, core technological architecture, design of the APIs,
competitive replication of functionality and multi-homing. Research addressing
the evolution of software ecosystem should, therefore, acknowledge that
software ecosystems entangle with other software ecosystems in multiple ways,
even with competing ones. A rigorous analysis of the evolution of a software
ecosystem should not be solely confined to its inner boundaries.

their ability to transfer excitations from the antenna to the energy trapping
center before recombination. Exciton diffusion length similarly limits organic
photovoltaics and demands bulk heterojunction architectures. Dark state
protection, achieved by coherent coupling between subunits within the antenna,
can significantly reduce radiative recombination and enhance the efficiency of
energy trapping. In this work we extend the dark state concept to the
double-excitation manifold by studying the dynamical flow of excitations. We
show the lowest double-excitation state carries minimal oscillator strength but
relaxation to this state from higher lying double excitations can be relatively
rapid such that the lowest double excitation state can act as a dynamical dark
state protecting excitation from radiative recombination. This mechanism is
sensitive to topology and operates differently for chain and ring structures,
while becoming more pronounced in both geometries when the size of the antenna
increases. When the exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) mechanism is considered,
the double-excitation population is quickly depleted and the dynamics changes
dramatically. However the efficiency and output power are still significantly
different from those calculated using the single-excitation manifold alone,
justifying the necessity of considering the double-excitation manifold.
Remarkably, in certain scenarios, the EEA can even increase the overall light
harvesting efficiency by bringing population down from the double-excitation
dark states to the single-excitation manifold.

many predictors. The functional data response is modeled nonparametrically
using unknown basis functions, which produces a flexible and data-adaptive
functional basis. We incorporate shrinkage priors that effectively remove
unimportant scalar covariates from the model and reduce sensitivity to the
number of (unknown) basis functions. For variable selection in functional
regression, we propose a decision theoretic posterior summarization technique,
which identifies a subset of covariates that retains nearly the predictive
accuracy of the full model. Our approach is broadly applicable for Bayesian
functional regression models, and unlike existing methods provides joint rather
than marginal selection of important predictor variables. Computationally
scalable posterior inference is achieved using a Gibbs sampler with linear time
complexity in the number of predictors. The resulting algorithm is empirically
faster than existing frequentist and Bayesian techniques, and provides joint
estimation of model parameters, prediction and imputation of functional
trajectories, and uncertainty quantification via the posterior distribution. A
simulation study demonstrates improvements in estimation accuracy, uncertainty
quantification, and variable selection relative to existing alternatives. The
methodology is applied to actigraphy data to investigate the association
between intraday physical activity and responses to a sleep questionnaire.

rise to the fictitious electromagnetic field for magnons. As the net spin
density varies, the resultant equation of motion interpolates between the
relativistic Klein-Gordon equation at CP and the nonrelativistic

right- and the left-circularly polarized magnons with respect to the order

skyrmion-density approximation. For an experimental proposal, we predict that
the magnonic thermal Hall conductivity changes its sign when the ferrimagnet is

fast ions) as GK and neglecting the kinetic effects of the electrons. The
wave-particle nonlinearity only is considered in the EGAM nonlinear dynamics.
The BPS is studied with a 1D code where the thermal plasma is treated as a

hamiltonian formulation. A one-to-one mapping between the EGAM and the BPS is
described. The focus is on understanding and predicting the EP redistribution

low-drive regime, the BPS mapping with the EGAM is found to be complete, and in
the high-drive regime, the EGAM dynamics and the BPS dynamics are found to
differ. The transition is described with the presence of a non-negligible
frequency chirping, which affects the EGAM but not the BPS, above the
identified drive threshold. The difference can be resolved by adding an ad-hoc
frequency modification to the BPS model. As a main result, the formula for the

in, e.g., multi-view active object recognition by a robot. This paper presents
VERAM, a recurrent attention model capable of actively selecting a sequence of
views for highly accurate 3D shape classification. VERAM addresses an important
issue commonly found in existing attention-based models, i.e., the unbalanced
training of the subnetworks corresponding to next view estimation and shape
classification. The classification subnetwork is easily overfitted while the
view estimation one is usually poorly trained, leading to a suboptimal
classification performance. This is surmounted by three essential
view-enhancement strategies: 1) enhancing the information flow of gradient
backpropagation for the view estimation subnetwork, 2) devising a highly
informative reward function for the reinforcement training of view estimation
and 3) formulating a novel loss function that explicitly circumvents view
duplication. Taking grayscale image as input and AlexNet as CNN architecture,
VERAM with 9 views achieves instance-level and class-level accuracy of 95:5%
and 95:3% on ModelNet10, 93:7% and 92:1% on ModelNet40, both are the

memory access latency and are limited to shared-memory systems. Many of these
PRAM algorithms are also very complicated to implement. Another popular method
is ""leader-contraction"" where the challenge is to select a constant fraction of
leaders that are adjacent to a constant fraction of non-leaders with high
probability. Instead we investigate label propagation because it is
deterministic and does not rely on pointer-chasing. Label propagation exchanges
representative labels within a component using simple graph traversal, but it
is inherently difficult to complete in a sublinear number of steps. We are able
to solve the problems with label propagation for graph connectivity.
  We introduce a surprisingly simple framework for deterministic graph
connectivity using label propagation that is easily adaptable to many
computational models. It propagates directed edges and alternates edge
direction to achieve linear edge count each step and sublinear convergence. We
present new algorithms in PRAM, Stream, and MapReduce for a simple, undirected

  of pharmacokinetic models",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parameter estimation problems of mathematical models can often be formulated
as nonlinear least squares problems. Typically these problems are solved
numerically using iterative methods. The local minimiserobtained using these
iterative methods usually depends on the choice of the initial iterate. Thus,
the estimated parameter and subsequent analyses using it depend on the choice
of the initial iterate. One way to reduce the analysis bias due to the choice
of the initial iterate is to repeat the algorithm from multiple initial
iterates (i.e. use a multi-start method). However, the procedure can be
computationally intensive and is not always used in practice. To overcome this
problem, we propose the Cluster Gauss-Newton (CGN) method, an efficient
algorithm for finding multiple approximate minimisers of nonlinear-least
squares problems. CGN simultaneously solves the nonlinear least squares problem
from multiple initial iterates. Then, CGN iteratively improves the solutions
from these initial iterates similarly to the Gauss-Newton method. However, it
uses a global linear approximation instead of the Jacobian. The global linear
approximations are computed collectively among all the iterates to minimise the
computational cost. We use physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models
used in pharmaceutical drug development to demonstrate its use and show that
CGN is computationally more efficient and more robust against local minima
compared to the standard Levenberg-Marquardt method, as well as state-of-the
art multi-start and derivative-free methods.

appearance. However, there is now an astonishingly large number of different
models in practical use. Both a lack of BRDF model standardisation across
implementations found in different renderers, as well as the often semantically
different capabilities of various models, have grown to be a major hindrance to
the interchange of production assets between different rendering systems.
Current attempts to solve this problem rely on manually finding visual
similarities between models, or mathematical ones between their functional
shapes, which requires access to the shader implementation, usually unavailable
in commercial renderers. We present a method for automatic translation of
material appearance between different BRDF models, which uses an image-based
metric for appearance comparison, and that delegates the interaction with the
model to the renderer. We analyse the performance of the method, both with
respect to robustness and visual differences of the fits for multiple
combinations of BRDF models. While it is effective for individual BRDFs, the
computational cost does not scale well for spatially-varying BRDFs. Therefore,
we further present a parametric regression scheme that approximates the shape
of the transformation function and generates a reduced representation which
evaluates instantly and without further interaction with the renderer. We
present respective visual comparisons of the remapped SVBRDF models for
commonly used renderers and shading models, and show that our approach is able
to extrapolate transformed BRDF parameters better than other complex regression
schemes.

$S\in\mathbb{R}^{\Omega\times\Omega}_+$ be a symmetric substochastic matrix.
For an integer $t\ge 0$, let $m_t = \smash{\left\langle v,S^tu\right\rangle}$,
which we view as the heat measured by $v$ after an initial heat configuration
$u$ is let to diffuse for $t$ time steps according to $S$. Since $S$ is entropy
improving, one may intuit that $m_t$ should not change too rapidly over time.
We give the following formalizations of this intuition.
  We prove that $m_{t+2} \ge m_t^{1+2/t}\!,$ an inequality studied earlier by
Blakley and Dixon (also Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits) for $u=v$ and shown true
under the restriction $m_t\ge e^{-4t}$. Moreover we prove that for any
$\epsilon>0$, a stronger inequality $m_{t+2} \ge t^{1-\epsilon}\cdot
\smash{m_t^{1+2/t}}$ holds unless $m_{t+2}m_{t-2}\ge \delta m_t^2$ for some
$\delta$ that depends on $\epsilon$ only. Phrased differently, $\forall
\epsilon> 0, \exists \delta> 0$ such that $\forall S,u,v$ \begin{equation*}
\frac{m_{t+2}}{m_{t}^{1+2/t}}\ge \min\left\{t^{1-\epsilon},
\delta\frac{m_t^{1-2/t}}{m_{t-2}}\right\}, \quad \forall t \ge 2,
\end{equation*} which can be viewed as a truncated log-convexity statement.
  Using this inequality, we answer two related open questions in complexity
theory: Any property tester for $k$-linearity requires $\Omega(k\log k)$
queries and the randomized communication complexity of the $k$-Hamming distance
problem is $\Omega(k\log k)$. Further we show that any randomized parity

co-firing patterns of a set of place cells in the brain. One wide-open problem
in this area is to determine when a given code can be algorithmically drawn in
the plane as a Venn diagram-like figure. A sufficient condition to do so is for
the code to have a property called $k$-inductively pierced. Gross, Obatake, and
Youngs recently used toric algebra to show that a code on three neurons is
$1$-inductively pierced if and only if the toric ideal is trivial or generated
by quadratics. No result is known for additional neurons in the same
generality, part of the difficulty coming from the large number of codewords
possible when additional neurons are used.
  In this article, we study two infinite classes of combinatorial neural codes
in detail. For each code, we explicitly compute its universal Gr\""obner basis.
This is done for the first class by recognizing that the codewords form a
Lawrence-type matrix. With the second class, this is done by showing that the
matrix is totally unimodular. These computations allow one to compute the state
polytopes of the corresponding toric ideals, from which all distinct initial
ideals may be computed efficiently. Moreover, we show that the state polytopes
are combinatorially equivalent to well-known polytopes: the permutohedron and
the stellohedron.

However, the challenge of dealing with the fluctuating bandwidth, scarce

Forward Error Correction (FEC) and Unequal Error Protection (UEP) approaches is
known to provide the distribution of video applications for wireless users with
Quality of Experience (QoE) assurance. This thesis proposed a procedure to
assess the video characteristics and their related impact on the perceived

types of wireless networks. A number of methods to set an adaptive amount of

heuristic techniques, the mechanisms rely on human experience to define the
best strategy. The advantages and drawbacks of the proposed mechanisms were
demonstrated in realistic simulations using real video sequences and actual

to understanding the organization and functioning of large-scale, complex
systems. We demonstrate three modalities of information flow from time series X
to time series Y. Intrinsic information flow exists when the past of X is
individually predictive of the present of Y, independent of Y's past; this is
most commonly considered information flow. Shared information flow exists when
X's past is predictive of Y's present in the same manner as Y's past; this
occurs due to synchronization or common driving, for example. Finally,
synergistic information flow occurs when neither X's nor Y's pasts are
predictive of Y's present on their own, but taken together they are. The two
most broadly-employed information-theoretic methods of quantifying information
flow---time-delayed mutual information and transfer entropy---are both
sensitive to a pair of these modalities: time-delayed mutual information to
both intrinsic and shared flow, and transfer entropy to both intrinsic and
synergistic flow. To quantify each mode individually we introduce our
cryptographic flow ansatz, positing that intrinsic flow is synonymous with
secret key agreement between X and Y. Based on this, we employ an
easily-computed secret-key-agreement bound---intrinsic mutual
information&mdashto quantify the three flow modalities in a variety of systems

well-established that clinical data may exhibit many other types of invariances
(e.g., scaling). While preprocessing techniques, (e.g., dynamic time warping)
may successfully transform and align inputs, their use often requires one to
identify the types of invariances in advance. In contrast, we propose the use
of Sequence Transformer Networks, an end-to-end trainable architecture that
learns to identify and account for invariances in clinical time-series data.
Applied to the task of predicting in-hospital mortality, our proposed approach
achieves an improvement in the area under the receiver operating characteristic

results suggest that a variety of valuable invariances can be learned directly

results on the existence of Na-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the
Galactic globular cluster M4 (NGC6121). The studies disagree on whether or not
Na-rich red giant branch (RGB) stars evolve to the AGB. For a sample of
previously published HER- MES/AAT AGB and RGB stellar spectra we present a
re-analysis of O, Na, and Fe abundances, and a new analysis of Mg and Al
abundances; we also present CN band strengths for this sample, derived from
low-resolution AAOmega spectra. Following a detailed literature comparison, we
find that the AGB samples of all studies consistently show lower abundances of
Na and Al, and are weaker in CN, than RGB stars in the cluster. This is similar
to recent observations of AGB stars in NGC 6752 and M 62. In an attempt to
explain this result, we present new theoretical stellar evolutionary models for
M 4; however, these predict that all stars, including Na-rich RGB stars, evolve
onto the AGB. We test the robustness of our abundance results using a variety
of atmospheric models and spectroscopic methods; however, we do not find
evidence that systematic modelling uncertainties can explain the apparent lack
of Na- rich AGB stars in M4. We conclude that an unexplained, but robust,
discordance between observations and theory remains for the AGB stars in M 4.

stars. Here we examine a challenging case: the merging of the neon and oxygen
burning shells in a 23 M$_{\odot}$ star. A previously unknown quasi-steady
state is established by the interplay between mixing, turbulent transport, and
nuclear burning. The resulting stellar structure has two burning shells within
a single convection zone. We find that the new neon burning layer covers an
extended region of the convection zone, with the burning peak occurring
substantially below where the Damk\""ohler number first becomes equal to unity.
These characteristics differ from those predicted by 1D stellar evolution
models of similar ingestion events. We develop the mean-field turbulence
equations that govern compositional evolution, and use them to interpret our
data set. An important byproduct is a means to quantify sub-grid-scale effects
intrinsic to the numerical hydrodynamic scheme. For implicit large eddy
simulations, the analysis method is particularly powerful because it can reveal
where and how simulated flows are modified by resolution, and provide
straightforward physical interpretations of the effects of dissipation or
induced transport. Focusing on the mean-field composition variance equations
for our analysis, we recover a Kolmogorov rate of turbulent dissipation without
it being imposed, in agreement with previous results which used the turbulent

deprojected $Z_{\rm Fe}$ profile of each cluster out to $\sim 0.4r_{500}$, and
identify a peak in the distribution of iron followed by a flatter distribution
at larger radii. Due to the steep gradient both in gas density and abundance,
we find that the emission-weighted iron abundance within $0.2r_{500}$, which
entirely includes the iron peak in most of the cases, is on average $\sim$25\%
higher than the mass-weighted value, showing that spatially resolved analysis
and accurate deprojection are key to study the evolution of iron enrichment in
the very central regions of cool core clusters. We quantify the extent of the
iron distribution in each cluster with a normalized scale parameter $r_{\rm
Fe}$, defined as the radius where the iron abundance excess is half of its peak
value. We find that $r_{\rm Fe}$ increases by a factor of $\sim 3$ from $z\sim
1$ to $z\sim 0.1$, suggesting that the spatial distribution of iron in the ICM
extends with time, possibly due to the mixing with the mechanical-mode feedback
from the central galaxy. We also find that the iron mass excess within

specific individual in a dense or complex scene, we divide each frame of the
surveillance video into a fixed number of grids and select a single
representative point in each grid as the individual to track. The repulsive
force model, which can accurately reflect interactive behaviors of crowds, is
used to calculate the interactive forces between grid particles in crowded
scenes and to construct a force flow matrix using these discrete forces from a
fixed number of continuous frames. The force flow matrix, which contains
spatial and temporal information, is adopted to train a group of visual
dictionaries by sparse coding. To further improve the detection efficiency and
avoid concept drift, we propose a fully unsupervised global and local dynamic
updating algorithm, based on sparse reconstruction and a group of word pools.
For anomaly location, since our method is based on a fixed grid, we can judge
whether anomalies occur in a region intuitively according to the reconstruction
error of the corresponding visual words. We experimentally verify the proposed
method using the UMN dataset, the UCSD dataset and the Web dataset separately.

domain, our monocular visual-inertial tracking system can obtain continuous six
degree of freedom (6-DoF) pose estimation without scale ambiguity. Our method
requires neither fixed multi-camera nor depth sensor settings for scale
observability, instead, the IMU inside the monocular sensing suite provides
scale information for both camera itself and the tracked object. We build the
proposed system on top of our monocular visual-inertial system (VINS) to obtain
accurate state estimation of the monocular camera in the world frame. The whole
system consists of a 2D object tracker, an object region-based visual bundle
adjustment (BA), VINS and a correlation analysis-based metric scale estimator.
Experimental comparisons with ground truth demonstrate the tracking accuracy of
our 3D tracking performance while a mobile augmented reality (AR) demo shows

quantization of one-bit ADCs results in an irreversible loss of information. In
the context of channel estimation, studies have been developed extensively to
combat the performance loss incurred by one-bit ADCs. Furthermore, in the field
of array signal processing, direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation combined with
one-bit ADCs has gained growing interests recently to minimize the estimation
error. In this paper, a channel estimator is proposed for one-bit ADCs where
the channels are characterized by their angular geometries, e.g., uniform
linear arrays (ULAs). The goal is to estimate the dominant channel among
multiple paths. The proposed channel estimator first finds the DOA estimate
using the maximum inner product search (MIPS). Then, the channel fading
coefficient is estimated using the concavity of the log-likelihood function.
The limit inherent in one-bit ADCs is also investigated, which results from the
loss of magnitude information.

using low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at base stations.
Channel estimation becomes a difficult task by using low-resolution ADCs
though. This paper addresses the channel estimation problem for massive MIMO
systems using one-bit ADCs when the channels are spatially and temporally

non-linear one-bit quantization to a statistically equivalent linear operator,
the Kalman filter is used to estimate the spatially and temporally correlated

Numerical results show that the proposed technique can improve the channel

cooperating BSs (each equipped with multiple antennas) jointly perform
zero-forcing beamforming to the set of single-antenna users associated with
them. As compared to a baseline network MIMO systems with disjoint BS clusters,
the effect of user-centric clustering is that it improves signal strength in
both UL and DL, while reducing cluster-edge interference in DL. This paper
quantifies these effects by assuming that BSs and users form Poisson point
processes and by further approximating both the signal and interference powers
using Gamma distributions of appropriate parameters. We show that BS
cooperation provides significant gain as compared to single-cell processing for
both UL and DL, but the advantage of user-centric clustering over the baseline

lack of observational constraints to growing protoplanets. Recently, detection
of an H{\alpha}-emission excess via direct imaging was reported for the
protoplanet LkCa15b orbiting the pre-main-sequence star LkCa15. However, the
physical mechanism for the H{\alpha} emission is poorly understood. According
to recent high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the
flow accreting onto protoplanets, the disk gas flows down almost vertically
onto and collides with the surface of a circum-planetary disk at a super-sonic
velocity and thus passes through a strong shockwave. The shock-heated gas is
hot enough to generate H{\alpha} emission. Here we develop a one-dimensional
radiative hydrodynamic model of the flow after the shock by detailed
calculations of chemical reactions and electron transitions in hydrogen atoms,
and quantify the hydrogen line emission in the Lyman-, Balmer-, and
Paschen-series from the accreting gas giant system. We then demonstrate that
the H{\alpha} intensity is strong enough to be detected with current
observational technique. Comparing our theoretical H{\alpha} intensity with the
observed one from LkCa15b, we constrain the protoplanet mass and the disk gas
density. Observation of hydrogen line emission from protoplanets is highly
encouraged to obtain direct constraints of accreting gas giants, which will be
key in understanding the formation of gas giants.

solvability of linear quadratic optimal problem in finite horizon subject to
the discrete-time NCSs is expressed by solving the forward and backward
stochastic difference equations (FBSDEs-M) which is derived from the maximum
principle involving Markov jump and delay. Secondly, under basic assumption,
the necessary and sufficient condition of mean square stabilization is given by
the solutions to the coupled algebraic Riccati equations with Markov jump

These include Skyrmion textures characterized by non-zero topological charge,
and topologically-trivial spirals arising from the competition of the
Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. For the former, we extend
our previous results on quantum exactness of classical
Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) ground-state degeneracies to the general
case of K\""ahler manifolds, with a specific example of Grassmann manifolds
$\mathrm{Gr(M,N)}$. These are relevant to quantum Hall ferromagnets with
$\mathrm{N}$ internal states and integer filling factor $\mathrm{M}$. A
promising candidate for their experimental implementation is monolayer graphene
with $\mathrm{N=4}$ corresponding to spin and valley degrees of freedom at the
charge neutrality point with $\mathrm{M=2}$ filled Landau levels. We find that
the vanishing of the zero-point fluctuations in taking the continuum limit
occurs differently in the case of BPS states compared to the case of more
general smooth textures, with the latter exhibiting more pronounced lattice
effects. This motivates us to consider the vanishing of zero-point fluctuations
in such near-ferromagnets more generally. We present a family of lattice spin
models for which the vanishing of zero-point fluctuations is evident, and show
that some spirals can be thought of as having nonzero but weak zero-point
fluctuations on account of their closeness to this family. Between them, these
instances provide concrete illustrations of how the Casimir energy, dependent
on the full UV-structure of the theory, evolves as the continuum limit is
taken.

theory based LB models for multicomponent gas diffusion, the present model does
not include any complicated interpolations, and its collision process can be
still implemented locally. Therefore, the advantages of single-component LB

situ observations, have attempted to determine some of the internal properties
of CMEs, which were limited to a certain position or a certain time. For
understanding the evolution of the internal thermodynamic state of CMEs during
their heliospheric propagation, we improve the self-similar flux rope internal
state (FRIS) model, which is constrained by measured propagation and expansion
speed profiles of a CME. We implement the model to a CME erupted on 2008
December 12 and probe the internal state of the CME. It is found that the
polytropic index of the CME plasma decreased continuously from 1.8 to 1.35 as
the CME moved away from the Sun, implying that the CME released heat before it
reached adiabatic state and then absorbed heat. We further estimate the entropy
changing and heating rate of the CME. We also find that the thermal force
inside the CME is the internal driver of CME expansion while Lorentz force
prevented the CME from expanding. It is noted that centrifugal force due to
poloidal motion decreased with the fastest rate and Lorentz force decreased
slightly faster than thermal pressure force as CME moved away from the Sun. We
also discuss the limitations of the model and approximations made in the study.

September 10. We attempt to investigate the evolutions of the two great flares
and their associated complex magnetic system in detail. Aided by the NLFFF
modeling, we identify a double-decker flux rope configuration above the
polarity inversion line (PIL) in the AR core region. The north ends of these
two flux ropes were rooted in a negative- polarity magnetic patch, which began
to move along the PIL and rotate anticlockwise before the X9.3 flare on
September 06. The strong shearing motion and rotation contributed to the
destabilization of the two magnetic flux ropes, of which the upper one
subsequently erupted upward due to the kink-instability. Then another two sets
of twisted loop bundles beside these ropes were disturbed and successively
erupted within 5 minutes like a chain reaction. Similarly, multiple ejecta
components were detected to consecutively erupt during the X8.2 flare occurring
in the same AR on September 10. We examine the evolution of the AR magnetic
fields from September 03 to 06 and find that five dipoles emerged successively
at the east of the main sunspot. The interactions between these dipoles took
place continuously, accompanied by magnetic flux cancellations and strong
shearing motions. In AR 12673, significant flux emergence and successive
interactions between the different emerging dipoles resulted in a complex
magnetic system, accompanied by the formations of multiple flux ropes and
twisted loop bundles. We propose that the eruptions of a multi-flux-rope system
resulted in the two largest flares in Solar Cycle 24.

binary response is of interest. Typically, the random effects are assumed to be
independent but this is seldom the case for many real applications. In the
credit risk application considered in this paper, random effects are present at
the level of industrial sectors and they are expected to be correlated due to
inter-firm credit links inducing dependencies in the firms' risk to default.
Unfortunately, existing inferential procedures for correlated mixed Probit
models are computationally very intensive already for a moderate number of
effects. Borrowing from the literature on large network inference, we propose
an efficient Expectation-Maximization algorithm for unconstrained and penalised
likelihood estimation and derive the asymptotic standard errors of the
estimates. An extensive simulation study shows that the proposed approach
enjoys substantial computational gains relative to standard Monte Carlo
approaches, while still providing accurate parameter estimates. Using data on
nearly 64,000 accounts for small and medium-sized enterprises in the United
Kingdom in 2013 across 14 industrial sectors, we find that accounting for
network effects via a correlated mixed Probit model increases significantly the
default prediction power of the model compared to conventional default
prediction models, making efficient inferential procedures for these models
particularly useful in this field.

FastReact outsources simple monitoring and control actions to evolving

actions using Boolean Logic which are then installed in the data plane. The
data plane parses and caches sensor values and performs simple calculations on

By using multiple hash functions, they summarize massive streams in sub-linear
space. In reality, data item ids or keys can be modular, e.g., a graph edge is
represented by source and target node ids, a 32-bit IP address is composed of
four 8-bit words, a web address consists of domain name, domain extension,

modularity property of item keys, and systematically develop more accurate,
composite hashing strategies, such as employing multiple independent hash
functions that hash different modules in a key and their combinations
separately, instead of hashing the entire key directly into the sketch.
  However, our problem of finding the best hashing strategy is non-trivial,
since there are exponential number of ways to combine the modules of a key
before they can be hashed into the sketch. Moreover, given a fixed size
allocated for the entire sketch, it is hard to find the optimal range of all
hash functions that correspond to different modules and their combinations. We
solve both these problems with extensive theoretical analysis, and perform
thorough experiments with real-world datasets to demonstrate the accuracy and

text descriptions given by users, which is a highly challenging task. The main
issues of text-to-image synthesis lie in two gaps: the heterogeneous and
homogeneous gaps. The heterogeneous gap is between the high-level concepts of
text descriptions and the pixel-level contents of images, while the homogeneous
gap exists between synthetic image distributions and real image distributions.
For addressing these problems, we exploit the excellent capability of generic
discriminative models (e.g. VGG19), which can guide the training process of a
new generative model on multiple levels to bridge the two gaps. The high-level
representations can teach the generative model to extract necessary visual
information from text descriptions, which can bridge the heterogeneous gap. The
mid-level and low-level representations can lead it to learn structures and
details of images respectively, which relieves the homogeneous gap. Therefore,
we propose Symmetrical Distillation Networks (SDN) composed of a source
discriminative model as ""teacher"" and a target generative model as ""student"".
The target generative model has a symmetrical structure with the source
discriminative model, in order to transfer hierarchical knowledge accessibly.
Moreover, we decompose the training process into two stages with different
distillation paradigms for promoting the performance of the target generative
model. Experiments on two widely-used datasets are conducted to verify the
effectiveness of our proposed SDN.

window including the He I triplet 10830 A and Si I 10827 A with a

August 9th, 2015. Observed Stokes profiles of the He I triplet in the flare
kernel in its post-maximum phase are well reproduced through inversions
considering the Zeeman and the Paschen-Back effects with a three slab model of
the flare kernel, in which two slabs having up and downward velocities produce
emissions and one slab produces an absorption. The magnetic field strength
inferred from the emission components of the He I line is 1400 G, which is
significantly stronger than 690 G that is observed at the same location in the
same line 6.5 hours before the flare. In addition, photospheric magnetic field
vector derived from the Si I10827 A is similar to that of the flare kernel. To
explain this results, we suggest that the emission in the He I triplet during
the flare is produced in the deep layer, around which bombardment of
non-thermal electrons leads to the formation of a coronal temperature plasma.
Assuming a hydrogen column density at the location where the He I emissions are
formed, and a power-law index of non-thermal electron energy distribution, we
derived the low-energy cutoff of the non-thermal electron as 20 - 30 keV, which
is consistent with that inferred from hard X-ray data obtained by RHESSI.

harmonic relationship. This then will provide us with a list of constraints,
necessary for any attempt of modelling their origin. We defined five groups
based on their similarities in the Fourier domain, namely the continuum of
their power density spectra (PDS) and the HFQPO frequencies. We then combined
the individual PDSs of each family to obtain a PDS with higher statistics to
search for other potential, previously undetected, weaker peaks. While we have

quintessential ingredient underlying spontaneous symmetry breaking in itinerant

inherent Fermi surface nesting makes the translationally invariant metallic
state unstable, which is known as Peierls instability. Extending the scope of
Peierls instability to two (2D) or three dimensions (3D), however, is not
straightforward, since the Fermi surface in higher dimensions is generally not
nested. In this work, we show that a perfectly nested Fermi surface can be
realized in a class of 2D perovskite oxides, giving rise to 2D Peierls
instability. Here the central role is played by the zone boundary Dirac line
node (DLN) protected by two orthogonal glide mirrors induced by the rotation of
oxygen octahedra. Especially, at a critical angle of the octahedron rotation,
the zone-boundary DLN flattens, leading to logarithmically diverging
susceptibility. We propose the 2D Peierls instability driven by dispersionless
DLN as a principle mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking in various
layered perovskite oxides including the antiferromagnetism of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. As
a clear signature of the 2D Peierls instability, we predict that the magnetic

sub-Doppler cooling of $^{6}$Li atoms with minimum experimental overhead. To
integrate the $D_1$ light for the gray molasses (GM) cooling into the same
optical setup that is used for the $D_2$ light for a standard magneto-optical
trap (MOT), we rapidly switch the injection seeding of a slave laser between
the $D_2$ and $D_1$ light sources. Switching times as short as
$30\,\mu\textrm{s}$ can be achieved, inferred from monitor optical beat
signals. The resulting low-intensity molasses cools a sample of $N=9\times10^8$
atoms to about $60\,\mu\textrm{K}$. A maximum phase-space density of
$\rho=1.2\times10^{-5}$ is observed. On the same setup, the performance of the
GM is compared to that of narrow-line cooling in a UV MOT, following the
procedure in Sebastian et al. (2014). Further, we compare the production of a
degenerate Fermi gas using both methods. Loading an optical dipole trap from
the gray molasses yields a quantum degenerate sample with $3.3\times10^5$
atoms, while loading from the denser UV MOT yields $2.4\times10^6$ atoms. Where
the highest atom numbers are not a priority this implementation of the gray

values in suitable spaces of generalized functions, and then use these
decompositions to prove results about Gaussian multiplicative chaos.
  We prove two decomposition theorems. The first one is a global one and says
that if the difference between the covariance kernels of two Gaussian fields,
taking values in some Sobolev space, has suitable Sobolev regularity, then
these fields differ by a H\""older continuous Gaussian process. Our second
decomposition theorem is more specialized and is in the setting of Gaussian
fields whose covariance kernel has a logarithmic singularity on the diagonal --
or log-correlated Gaussian fields. The theorem states that any log-correlated
Gaussian field $X$ can be decomposed locally into a sum of a H\""older
continuous function and an independent almost $\star$-scale invariant field (a
special class of stationary log-correlated fields with 'cone-like' white noise
representations). This decomposition holds whenever the term $g$ in the
covariance kernel $C_X(x,y)=\log(1/|x-y|)+g(x,y)$ has locally
$H^{d+\varepsilon}$ Sobolev smoothness.
  We use these decompositions to extend several results that have been known
basically only for $\star$-scale invariant fields to general log-correlated
fields. These include the existence of critical multiplicative chaos, analytic
continuation of the subcritical chaos in the so-called inverse temperature
parameter $\beta$, as well as generalised Onsager-type covariance inequalities

architecture for efficiently processing large-scale 3D data. One striking
characteristic of our approach is its ability to process unorganized 3D
representations such as point clouds as input, then transforming them
internally to ordered structures to be processed via 3D convolutions. In
contrast to conventional approaches that maintain either unorganized or
organized representations, from input to output, our approach has the advantage
of operating on memory efficient input data representations while at the same
time exploiting the natural structure of convolutional operations to avoid the
redundant computing and storing of spatial information in the network. The
network eliminates the need to pre- or post process the raw sensor data. This,
together with the fully-convolutional nature of the network, makes it an
end-to-end method able to process point clouds of huge spaces or even entire
rooms with up to 200k points at once. Another advantage is that our network can
produce either an ordered output or map predictions directly onto the input
cloud, thus making it suitable as a general-purpose point cloud descriptor
applicable to many 3D tasks. We demonstrate our network's ability to
effectively learn both low-level features as well as complex compositional
relationships by evaluating it on benchmark datasets for semantic voxel
segmentation, semantic part segmentation and 3D scene captioning.

$D$-Mott phase or $d$-wave superconductivity appears when the on-site
interaction is dominant, while a charge-density wave or an excitonic insulator
phase emerges when the nearest neighbor interaction becomes comparable to the
on-site interaction. The electron-phonon coupling, treated by a two-cutoff
scaling scheme, leads to different behavior in two types of nanotubes. For
strong electron-phonon interactions, phonon softening is induced and a Peierls
insulator phase appears in armchair nanotubes. We find that this softening of
phonons may occur for any intraband scattering phonon mode. On the other hand,
the effect of electron-phonon coupling is negligible for zigzag nanotubes. The
distinct behavior of armchair and zigzag nanotubes against lattice distortion
is explained by analysis of the renormalization group equations.

energy-preserving scheme for the sine-Gordon equation. The basic idea is from
the invariant energy quadratization approach to construct energy stable schemes
for gradient systems, which are energy dispassion. We here take the sine-Gordon
equation as an example to show that the invariant energy quadratization
approach is also an efficient way to construct linearly implicit and local
energy-conserving schemes for energy-conserving systems. Utilizing the
invariant energy quadratization approach, the sine-Gordon equation is first
reformulated into an equivalent system, which inherits a modified local energy
conservation law. The new system are then discretized by the conventional
finite difference method and a semi-discretized system is obtained, which can
conserve the semi-discretized local energy conservation law. Subsequently, the
linearly implicit structure-preserving method is applied for the resulting
semi-discrete system to arrive at a fully discretized scheme. We prove that the
resulting scheme can exactly preserve the discrete local energy conservation
law. Moveover, with the aid of the classical energy method, an unconditional
and optimal error estimate for the scheme is established in discrete
$H_h^1$-norm. Finally, various numerical examples are addressed to confirm our
theoretical analysis and demonstrate the advantage of the new scheme over some
existing local structure-preserving schemes.

for fast estimation of the photospheric magnetic filling factor and

magneto-convection developed using MURAM code. Corresponding profiles of Fe I

Three different methods of the magnetic filling factor estimation are
considered: the magnetic line ratio method, Stokes V width method and a simple
statistical method. We find that the statistical method and the Stokes V width
method are sufficiently reliable for fast filling factor estimations.
Furthermore, we find that Stokes $I\pm V$ bisector splitting gradient can be

model capacity. Updating previously pruned filters provides our approach with
larger optimization space than fixing the filters to zero. Therefore, the
network trained by our method has a larger model capacity to learn from the
training data. (2) Less dependence on the pre-trained model. Large capacity
enables SFP to train from scratch and prune the model simultaneously. In

the pre-trained model to guarantee their performance. Empirically, SFP from
scratch outperforms the previous filter pruning methods. Moreover, our approach
has been demonstrated effective for many advanced CNN architectures. Notably,

continuum optical depth between the sunspot umbra and the quiet Sun. Measuring
the Wilson depression is important for understanding the geometry of sunspots.
Current methods suffer from systematic effects or need to make assumptions on
the geometry of the magnetic field. This leads to large systematic
uncertainties of the derived Wilson depressions.
  Aims: We aim at developing a robust method for deriving the Wilson depression
that only requires the information about the magnetic field that is accessible
from spectropolarimetry, and that does not rely on assumptions on the geometry
of sunspots or on their magnetic field.
  Methods: Our method is based on minimizing the divergence of the magnetic
field vector derived from spectropolarimetric observations. We focus on large
spatial scales only in order to reduce the number of free parameters.
  Results: We test the performance of our method using synthetic Hinode data
derived from two sunspot simulations. We find that the maximum and the umbral
averaged Wilson depression for both spots determined with our method typically
lies within 100 km of the true value obtained from the simulations. In
addition, we apply the method to Hinode observations of a sunspot. The derived
Wilson depression (about 600 km) is consistent with results typically obtained
from the Wilson effect. We also find that the Wilson depression obtained from
using horizontal force balance gives 110 - 180 km smaller Wilson depressions
than both, what we find and what we deduce directly from the simulations. This
suggests that the magnetic pressure and the magnetic curvature force contribute
to the Wilson depression by a similar amount.

arbitrary secret states are mixed with several ancillary squeezed modes through
a passive interferometer. We derive simple conditions on the interferometer for
this encoding to define a secret sharing protocol and we prove that they are
satisfied by almost any interferometer. This implies that, if the
interferometer is chosen uniformly at random, the probability that it may not
be used to implement a quantum secret sharing protocol is zero. Furthermore, we
show that the decoding operation can be obtained and implemented efficiently
with a Gaussian unitary using a number of single-mode squeezers that is at most
twice the number of modes of the secret, regardless of the number of players.
We benchmark the quality of the reconstructed state by computing the fidelity
with the secret state as a function of the input squeezing.

quark PDFs suggested in the recent literature: the strange sea enhancement and
a positive non-vanishing $d/u$ ratio at $x \to 1$. These possibilities are
examined using test versions of the ABMP16 PDF fit which demonstrate no need of
those changes. Furthermore, we localize peculiar features in other analyses
which are responsible for a different behaviour of the PDFs obtained. The
strange sea enhancement can be explained by a choice of the PDF shapes being
not flexible enough and therefore leading to an over-suppressed $d$-quark
distribution. This suppression has to be compensated by a corresponding rise by
the $s$-quark distribution. As a result, an unusually large strange sea
suppression factor is obtained. The non-vanishing value of $d/u\vert _{x=1}$
becomes consistent with zero in case the higher-order QCD corrections to the
D{\O} $W$-asymmetry data, which drive its value, are taken into account.
Furthermore, the related $e$-asymmetry sample prefers a slightly negative value
of $d/u\vert _{x=1}$, although it is consistent with zero. These clarifications
support confidence in the PDF shapes used in the ABMP16 analyses.

accurately and quickly. Transistors are at the core of modern technology and

becomes a major problem. The spintronics explores the spin degree of electrons
and thus bypasses the heat, at least in principle. For this reason, spin-based
technology offers a possible solution. In this review, we survey some of latest
developments in all-optical switching (AOS), where ultrafast laser pulses are
able to reverse spins from one direction to the other deterministically. But
AOS only occurs in a special group of magnetic samples and within a narrow
window of laser parameters. Some samples need multiple pulses to switch spins,
while others need a single-shot pulse. To this end, there are several models
available, but the underlying mechanism is still under debate. This review is
different from other prior reviews in two aspects. First, we sacrifice the
completeness of reviewing existing studies, while focusing on a limited set of
experimental results that are highly reproducible in different labs and provide
actual switched magnetic domain images. Second, we extract the common features
from existing experiments that are critical to AOS, without favoring a
particular switching mechanism. We emphasize that given the limited
experimental data, it is really premature to identify a unified mechanism. We
compare these features with our own model prediction, without resorting to a
phenomenological scheme. We hope that this review serves the broad readership
well.

strong ($\sim 10^5$ Solar Flux Units) solar radio burst in a relatively narrow
frequency range around 1~GHz.
  This indicates that this radio burst is the most probable space weather
candidate for explaining the radar disturbances. The dynamic radio spectrum
shows that the high flux densities are not due to synchrotron emission of
energetic electrons, but to coherent emission processes, which produce a large
variety of rapidly varying short bursts (such as pulsations, fiber bursts, and
zebra patterns). The radio burst occurs outside the impulsive phase of the
associated flare, about 30 minutes after the soft X-ray peak, and it is
temporarily associated with fast evolving activity occurring in strong solar
magnetic fields. While the relationship with strong magnetic fields and the
coherent spectral nature of the radio burst provide hints towards the physical
processes which generate such disturbances, we have so far no means to forecast
them. Well-calibrated monitoring instruments of whole Sun radio fluxes covering
the UHF band could at least provide a real-time identification of the origin of

the additional notion that the area of a set indicates probability whereas the
ratio of areas for conditional probability. Once parts of the diagram are drawn

simple arithmetic on the area of relevant sets. We discuss turtleback diagrams

detail several scenarios in which turtleback diagrams prove useful. By the
equivalence of recursive space partition and the tree, the turtleback diagram

Although these approaches have been crucial enablers for urban navigation, the
capabilities of robots employing such approaches are still limited to
navigating only on streets containing signalized intersections. In this paper,
we address this challenge and propose a multimodal convolutional neural network
framework to predict the safety of a street intersection for crossing. Our
architecture consists of two subnetworks; an interaction-aware trajectory
estimation stream IA-TCNN, that predicts the future states of all observed
traffic participants in the scene, and a traffic light recognition stream
AtteNet. Our IA-TCNN utilizes dilated causal convolutions to model the behavior
of the observable dynamic agents in the scene without explicitly assigning
priorities to the interactions among them. While AtteNet utilizes
Squeeze-Excitation blocks to learn a content-aware mechanism for selecting the
relevant features from the data, thereby improving the noise robustness.
Learned representations from the traffic light recognition stream are fused
with the estimated trajectories from the motion prediction stream to learn the
crossing decision. Furthermore, we extend our previously introduced Freiburg
Street Crossing dataset with sequences captured at different types of
intersections, demonstrating complex interactions among the traffic
participants. Extensive experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets
and our proposed dataset demonstrate that our network achieves state-of-the-art
performance for each of the subtasks, as well as for the crossing safety
prediction.

hippocampal neurons show a discontinuous sequence in which discrete transitions

for exoplanets. Among the target stars, spectroscopic binary systems have been
discovered, which can be used to measure fundamental properties of stars. Aims.
Using spectroscopic observations, we determine the orbital and physical
properties of nine new double-line spectroscopic binary systems by analysing
their radial velocity curves. Methods. We use two-dimensional cross-correlation
techniques to derive the radial velocities of the targets, which are then
employed to determine the orbital properties. Photometric data from the
literature are also analysed to search for possible eclipses and to measure
stellar variability, which can yield rotation periods. Results. Out of the 342
stars selected for the CARMENES survey, 9 have been found to be double-line
spectroscopic binaries, with periods ranging from 1.13 to ~8000 days and orbits
with eccentricities up to 0.54. We provide empirical orbital properties and
minimum masses for the sample of spectroscopic binaries. Absolute masses are
also estimated from mass-luminosity calibrations, ranging between ~0.1 and ~0.6
Msol . Conclusions. These new binary systems increase the number of double-line
M dwarf binary systems with known orbital parameters by 15%, and they have
lower mass ratios on average.

atomic physics, the Fano resonance in light scattering arises from the
interference between a narrow subradiant mode and a spectrally broad radiation
line. Here, we present an overview of Fano resonances in coated spherical
scatterers within the framework of the Lorenz-Mie theory. We briefly introduce
the concept of conventional and unconventional Fano resonances in light
scattering. These resonances are associated with the interference between
electromagnetic modes excited in the particle with different or the same
multipole moment, respectively. In addition, we investigate the modification of
the spontaneous-emission rate of an optical emitter at the presence of a
plasmonic nanoshell. This modification of decay rate due to electromagnetic
environment is referred to as the Purcell effect. We analytically show that the
Purcell factor related to a dipole emitter oriented orthogonal or tangential to
the spherical surface can exhibit Fano or Lorentzian line shapes in the near

realistic representations of populations. It is a fundamental problem in the
modeling of transport where the synthetic populations of micro-agents represent
a key input to most agent-based models. In this paper, a new methodological
framework for how to 'grow' pools of micro-agents is presented. The model
framework adopts a deep generative modeling approach from machine learning
based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Compared to the previous population
synthesis approaches, including Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), Gibbs
sampling and traditional generative models such as Bayesian Networks or Hidden
Markov Models, the proposed method allows fitting the full joint distribution
for high dimensions. The proposed methodology is compared with a conventional
Gibbs sampler and a Bayesian Network by using a large-scale Danish trip diary.
It is shown that, while these two methods outperform the VAE in the
low-dimensional case, they both suffer from scalability issues when the number
of modeled attributes increases. It is also shown that the Gibbs sampler
essentially replicates the agents from the original sample when the required
conditional distributions are estimated as frequency tables. In contrast, the
VAE allows addressing the problem of sampling zeros by generating agents that
are virtually different from those in the original data but have similar
statistical properties. The presented approach can support agent-based modeling
at all levels by enabling richer synthetic populations with smaller zones and
more detailed individual characteristics.

  Necessary and Sufficient Conditions",,,,,"cs.PF","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we consider a load balancing system under a general pull-based
policy. In particular, each arrival is randomly dispatched to one of the
servers whose queue lengths are below a threshold, if there are any; otherwise,
this arrival is randomly dispatched to one of the entire set of servers. We are
interested in the fundamental relationship between the threshold and the delay
performance of the system in heavy traffic. To this end, we first establish the
following necessary condition to guarantee heavy-traffic delay optimality: the
threshold will grow to infinity as the exogenous arrival rate approaches the
boundary of the capacity region (i.e., the load intensity approaches one) but
the growth rate should be slower than a polynomial function of the mean number
of tasks in the system. As a special case of this result, we directly show that
the delay performance of the popular pull-based policy Join-Idle-Queue (JIQ)
lies strictly between that of any heavy-traffic delay optimal policy and that
of random routing. We further show that a sufficient condition for
heavy-traffic delay optimality is that the threshold grows logarithmically with
the mean number of tasks in the system. This result directly resolves a
generalized version of the conjecture by Kelly and Laws.

granularity of the obtained performance data, and the use of model-based
techniques. The survey responses, which come from a wide variety of
participants from different industry sectors, indicate that the complexity of
performance engineering approaches and tools is a barrier for wide-spread
adoption of performance analysis in DevOps. The implication of our results is
that performance analysis tools need to have a short learning curve, and should
be easy to integrate into the DevOps pipeline.

binary containing a neutron star and an evolved giant star. This system,
together with the Rapid Burster (MXB 1730-33), are the only two systems that
display the so-called Type II X-ray bursts. These type of bursts, which last
for 10s of seconds, are thought to be caused by viscous instabilities in the
disk; however the Type II bursts seen in GRO J1744-28 are qualitatively very
different from those seen in the archetypal Type II bursting source the Rapid
Burster. To understand these differences and to create a framework for future
study, we perform a study of all X-ray observations of all 3 known outbursts of
the Bursting Pulsar which contained Type II bursts, including a population
study of all Type II X-ray bursts seen by RXTE. We find that the bursts from
this source are best described in four distinct phenomena or `classes' and that
the characteristics of the bursts evolve in a predictable way. We compare our
results with what is known for the Rapid Burster and put out results in the
context of models that try to explain this phenomena.

  Optimization",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular algorithm for solving challenging
optimization tasks. It is designed for problems where the objective function is
expensive to evaluate, perhaps not available in exact form, without gradient
information and possibly returning noisy values. Different versions of the
algorithm vary in the choice of the acquisition function, which recommends the
point to query the objective at next. Initially, researchers focused on
improvement-based acquisitions, while recently the attention has shifted to
more computationally expensive information-theoretical measures. In this paper
we present two major contributions to the literature. First, we propose a new
improvement-based acquisition function that recommends query points where the
improvement is expected to be high with high confidence. The proposed algorithm
is evaluated on a large set of benchmark functions from the global optimization
literature, where it turns out to perform at least as well as current
state-of-the-art acquisition functions, and often better. This suggests that it
is a powerful default choice for BO. The novel policy is then compared to
widely used global optimization solvers in order to confirm that BO methods
reduce the computational costs of the optimization by keeping the number of
function evaluations small. The second main contribution represents an
application to precision medicine, where the interest lies in the estimation of
parameters of a partial differential equations model of the human pulmonary
blood circulation system. Once inferred, these parameters can help clinicians
in diagnosing a patient with pulmonary hypertension without going through the
standard invasive procedure of right heart catheterization, which can lead to
side effects and complications (e.g. severe pain, internal bleeding,
thrombosis).

magnetism and low-energy pseudospin dynamics in the archetypal spin-orbit Mott

addition to magnetometry, we use neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron

quantify the interactions that determine the global symmetry of the system and
govern the linear responses of pseudospins to external magnetic felds and their
low-energy dynamics. We find that a pseudospin-only Hamiltonian is insufficient
for an accurate description of the magnetism in Sr2IrO4 and that
pseudospin-lattice coupling is essential. This finding should be generally
applicable to other pseudospin systems with sizable orbital moments sensitive
to anisotropic crystalline environments.

  In this paper we prove that deciding whether a given connected graph has

based on the astrometric parameters from Gaia data-release 2 (DR2). Methods. We
identified 140 sources with a reliable counterpart in the Gaia DR2 archive. We
determined the median distance of the cluster using Gaia parallaxes and fitted
the distribution of parallaxes and proper motions assuming the presence of two
clusters. We derived the probability of each single source of belonging to the
northern or southern sub-clusters, and compared the HR diagram of the most

of Chamaeleon I is ~190 pc. This is about 20 pc larger than the value commonly
adopted in the literature. From a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the parallaxes and
proper-motion distributions we conclude that the northern and southern clusters
do not belong to the same parent population. The northern population has a
distance dN = 192.7+/-0.4 pc, while the southern one dS = 186.5+/-0.7 pc. The
two sub-clusters appear coeval, at variance with literature results, and most
of the sources are younger than 3 Myr. The northern cluster is more elongated
and extends towards the southern direction partially overlapping with the more
compact cluster located in the south. A hint of a relative rotation between the
two sub-clusters is also found.

$J/\psi$ decays is performed using the $(1310.6\pm7.0)\times10^{6}$ $J/\psi$
decays collected by the BESIII detector. Two approaches are presented. A
mass-dependent analysis is performed by parameterizing the $K_{S}K_{S}$
invariant mass spectrum as a sum of Breit-Wigner line shapes. Additionally, a
mass-independent analysis is performed to extract a piecewise function that
describes the dynamics of the $K_{S}K_{S}$ system while making minimal
assumptions about the properties and number of poles in the amplitude. The
dominant amplitudes in the mass-dependent analysis include the $f_{0}(1710)$,
$f_{0}(2200)$, and $f_{2}^\prime(1525)$. The mass-independent results, which
are made available as input for further studies, are consistent with those of
the mass-dependent analysis and are useful for a systematic study of hadronic
interactions. The branching fraction of radiative $J/\psi$ decays to
$K_{S}K_{S}$ is measured to be $(8.1 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-4}$, where the
uncertainty is systematic and the statistical uncertainty is negligible.

periodic system while keeping its symmetry, a topological phase transition
usually occurs. A common model demonstrating such a topological phase
transition in condensed matter physics is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model.
As well known, two distinct topological phases emerge when the intracell
hopping is tuned from smaller to larger with respect to the intercell hopping
in the model. The former case is topologically trivial, while the latter case
is topologically non-trivial. Here, we design a 1D periodic acoustic system in
exact analogy to the SSH model. The unit cell of the acoustic system is
composed of two resonators and two junction tubes connecting them. We show that
the topological phase transition happens in our acoustic analog when we tune
the radii of the junction tubes which control the intercell and intracell
hoppings. The topological phase transition is characterized by the abrupt
change of the geometric Zak phase. The topological interface states between
non-trivial and trivial phases of our acoustic analog are experimentally
measured, and the results agree very well with the numerical values. Further,
we show that topologically non-trivial phases of our acoustic analog of the SSH
model can support edge states, on which the discussion is absent in previous
works about topological acoustics. The edge states are robust against localized
defects and perturbations.

to deal properly with high-dimensional and incomplete data. Currently, methods
dedicated to high-dimensional data handle missing values by ad-hoc strategies,
like complete case analysis or single imputation, while methods dedicated to
missing values, mainly based on multiple imputation, do not discuss the
imputation method to use with high-dimensional data. Consequently, both
approaches appear to be limited for many modern applications.
  With inspiration from ensemble methods, a new variable selection method is
proposed. It extends classical variable selection methods in the case of
high-dimensional data with or without missing data. Theoretical properties are
studied and the practical interest is demonstrated through a simulation study,
as well as through an application to models specification in sequential
multiple imputation.
  In the low dimensional case, the procedure improves the control of the error
risks, especially type I error, even without missing values for stepwise, lasso
or knockoff methods. With missing values, the method performs better than
reference selection methods based on multiple imputation. Similar performances
are obtained in the high-dimensional case with or without missing values.

types of agents, a parameter motivated and proposed already in the paper that
introduced GASP, has so far remained open.
  In this paper we establish the complexity map for GASP, sGASP and gGASP when
the number of types of agents is the parameter. Our positive results,
consisting of one fixed-parameter algorithm and one XP algorithm, rely on a
combination of novel Subset Sum machinery (which may be of general interest)

which are ""acyclic"". These algorithms are complemented by matching lower
bounds, which among others answer an open question of Gupta, Roy, Saurabh and
Zehavi (2017). In this direction, the techniques used to establish
W[1]-hardness of sGASP are of particular interest: as an intermediate step, we
use Sidon sequences to show the W[1]-hardness of a highly restricted variant of
multi-dimensional Subset Sum, which may find applications in other settings as
well.

$R\sim$15 mag and decayed by 2 magnitudes in only 3 days, making it one of the
brightest and fastest novae ever detected in Andromeda. From archival
multi-band data we have been able to trace its fast evolution down to $U>21$
mag in less than two weeks and to uncover for the first time the Super-Soft
X-ray phase, whose onset occurred 10-30 days from the optical maximum. The
X-ray spectrum is consistent with a blackbody with a temperature of $\sim$50 eV
and emitting radius of $\sim$4$\times 10^{9}$ cm, larger than a white dwarf
radius, indicating an expanded region. Its peak X-ray luminosity, 3.5$\times
10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, locates M31N 2013-01b among the most luminous novae in
M31. We also unambiguously detect a short 1.28$\pm$0.02 h X-ray periodicity
that we ascribe to the binary orbital period, possibly due to partial eclipses.
This makes M31N 2013-01b the first nova in M31 with an orbital period
determined. The short period also makes this nova one of the few known below
the 2-3 h orbital period gap. All the observed characteristics strongly
indicate that M31N 2013-01b harbours a massive white dwarf and a very low-mass
companion, consistent with being a nova belonging to the disc population of the
Andromeda Galaxy.

hopping on a one-dimensional lattice in the presence of dissipation. The model
exhibits a rich phase structure, with the average particle velocity in the
steady state playing the role of a non-equilibrium order parameter. Within each
phase the average velocity is proportional to a topological winding number and
to the inverse of the average time between quantum jumps. While the average
velocity depends smoothly on system parameters within each phase, nonanalytic
behavior arises at phase transition points. We show that certain types of
spatial boundaries between regions where different phases are realized host a
number of topological bound states which is equal to the difference between the
winding numbers characterizing the phases on the two sides of the boundary.
These topological bound states are attractors for the dynamics; in cases where
the winding number changes by more than one when crossing the boundary, the
subspace of topological bound states forms a dark, decoherence free subspace
for the dissipative system. Finally we discuss how the dynamics we describe can
be realized in a simple cavity or circuit QED setup, where the topological
boundary mode emerges as a robust coherent state of the light field.

the presence of Radio-Loud and Broad Absorption Line objects, and to
absorptions in both X-ray and optical/UV bands. We analyse the dependence of
the residuals of the relation on various physical parameters in order to
characterise the inter-source dispersion. We find a total dispersion of ~0.12

contributes for 56% of the variance of the relation. We find weak but
significant dependences of the residuals of the relation on black-hole (BH)
mass and on Eddington ratio, confirmed by a multivariate regression analysis of
$\alpha_{OX}$ as a function of optical/UV luminosity and the above quantities.
We find a weak positive correlation of both the $\alpha_{OX}$ and the residuals
of the relation with inclination indicators (FWHM(H$\beta$) and EW[O$_{III}$])
suggesting a weak increase of X-ray/UV ratio with the viewing angle. Our
results suggest the possibility of selecting a sample of objects, based on
their viewing angle and/or BH mass and Eddington ratio, for which the
$\alpha_{OX}-L_{UV}$ relation is as tight as possible, in light of the use of
the X-ray - optical/UV luminosity relation to build a distance modulus (DM) -

setting an upper limit of 240 mas yr$^{-1}$ (3$\sigma$ level), that translates
into an upper limit on the transverse velocity of $\sim$700 km s$^{-1}$, for an
assumed distance of 600 pc. A deep H$\alpha$ observation did not reveal the
bow-shock associated with a classical pulsar wind nebula, thus precluding an
indirect measurement of the proper motion direction. We determined the main
axes of the two nebulae, which are separated by an angle of 160.8$^{\circ} \pm
0.7^{\circ}$, using a new approach based on the Rolling Hough Transformation
(RHT). We analyzed the shape of the first 8' (out of the 12' seen by
XMM-Newton) of the brighter, extremely collimated one. Based on a combination
of our results from a standard analysis and a nebular modeling obtained from
the RHT, we find that the brightest nebula is curved on an arcmin-scale, with a
thickness ranging from $\sim9$"" to $\sim31$"" and a possible (single or
multiple) helicoidal pattern. We could not constrain the shape of the fainter
nebula. We discuss our results in the context of other known similar features,
with particular emphasis on the Lighthouse nebula (associated with PSR
J1101$-$6101). We speculate that a peculiar geometry of the powering pulsar may
play an important role in the formation of such features.

the number of pairs produced in an ionizing interaction is known to be
sub-Poissonian. The dispersion is reduced by the so-called ""Fano factor"", which
empirically encapsulates the correlations in the process of ionization. In
modelling the energy response of an ionization measurement device, the effect
of the Fano factor is commonly folded into the overall energy resolution. While
such an approximate treatment is appropriate when a significant number of
ionization pairs are expected to be produced, the Fano factor needs to be
accounted for directly at the level of pair creation when only a few are
expected. To do so, one needs a discrete probability distribution of the number
of pairs created $N$ with independent control of both the expectation $\mu$ and
Fano factor $F$. Although no distribution $P(N|\mu,F)$ with this convenient
form exists, we propose the use of the COM-Poisson distribution together with
strategies for utilizing it to effectively fulfill this need. We then use this
distribution to assess the impact that the Fano factor may have on the
sensitivity of low-mass WIMP search experiments.

the metric which geometrically comprises the information about such

modified by the reparametrizations, the metric structure on the thermodynamic

revenue-maximizing auctions and introduce a simple and generic method to design
novel bidding strategies if the seller uses past bids to optimize her
mechanism. We propose a simple and agnostic strategy, independent of the
distribution of the competition, that is robust to mechanism changes and local
(as opposed to global) optimization of e.g. reserve prices by the seller. This
strategy guarantees an increase in utility compared to the truthful strategy
for any distribution of the competition. In textbook-style examples, for
instance with uniform [0,1] value distributions and two bidders, this
no-side-information and mechanism-independent strategy yields an enormous 57%
increase in buyer utility for lazy second price auctions with monopoly
reserves. When the bidder knows the distribution of the highest bid of the
competition, we show how to optimize the tradeoff between reducing the reserve
price and beating the competition. Our formulation enables to study some
important robustness properties of the strategies, showing their impact even
when the seller is using a data-driven approach to set the reserve prices. In
this sample-size setting, we prove under what conditions, thresholding bidding
strategies can still improve the buyer's utility. The gist of our approach is
to see optimal auctions in practice as a Stackelberg game where the buyer is
the leader, as he is the first one to move (here bid) when the seller is the
follower as she has no prior information on the bidder.

and information theory, having a number of compelling physical interpretations.
There is a certain perspective that the most fundamental notion in quantum
mechanics is that of a quantum channel, as quantum states, unitary evolutions,
measurements, and discarding of quantum systems can each be regarded as certain
kinds of quantum channels. Thus, an important goal is to define a consistent
and meaningful notion of the entropy of a quantum channel. Motivated by the
fact that the entropy of a state $\rho$ can be formulated as the difference of
the number of physical qubits and the ""relative entropy distance"" between
$\rho$ and the maximally mixed state, here we define the entropy of a channel
$\mathcal{N}$ as the difference of the number of physical qubits of the channel
output with the ""relative entropy distance"" between $\mathcal{N}$ and the
completely depolarizing channel. We prove that this definition satisfies all of
the axioms, recently put forward in [Gour, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 65, 5880
(2019)], required for a channel entropy function. The task of quantum channel
merging, in which the goal is for the receiver to merge his share of the
channel with the environment's share, gives a compelling operational
interpretation of the entropy of a channel. The entropy of a channel can be
negative for certain channels, but this negativity has an operational
interpretation in terms of the channel merging protocol. We define Renyi and
min-entropies of a channel and prove that they satisfy the axioms required for
a channel entropy function. Among other results, we also prove that a smoothed
version of the min-entropy of a channel satisfies the asymptotic equipartition
property.

maximization reveals that we can achieve higher reliability with limited

Our analysis reveals that SINR variations have less impact on effective
capacity for strict delay constrained networks. We present an exemplary
scenario for massive MTC access to analyze the interference effect proposing
three methods to restore the effective capacity for a certain node which are
power control, graceful degradation of delay constraint and joint compensation.
Joint compensation combines both power control and graceful degradation of

X-ray radiation was carried out. The majority of such pulsars has short spin
periods with the average value $< P >$ = 133 msec. The distribution of period
derivatives reveals a bimodality, dividing millisecond ($< log \dfrac{dP}{dt}>$
= -19.69) and normal ($< log \dfrac{dP}{dt}> $ = -13.29) pulsars. Magnetic
fields at the surface of the neutron star are characterized by the bimodal
distribution as well. The mean values of $<log B_s>$ are $8.48$ and $12.41$ for
millisecond pulsars and normal ones, respectively. The distribution of magnetic
fields near the light cylinder, it does not show the noticeable bimodality. The
median value of $log B_{lc}$ = 4.43 is almost three orders higher comparing
with this quantity ($<log B_{lc}>$ = 1.75) for radio pulsars without registered
X-ray emission. Losses of rotational energy ($<log \dfrac{dE}{dt}>$ = 35.24)
are also three orders higher than corresponding values for normal pulsars.
There is the strong correlation between X-ray luminosities and losses of
rotational energies. The dependence of the X-ray luminosity on the magnetic
field at the light cylinder has been detected. It shows that the generation of
the non-thermal X-ray emission takes place at the periphery of the
magnetosphere and is caused by the synchrotron mechanism. We detected the
positive correlations between luminosities in radio, X-ray and gamma -ray
ranges. Such correlations give the possibility to carry out a purposeful search
for pulsars in one of these ranges if they radiate in other one.

numbers of formed resonance. The resulting classification of light mesons turns
out to be in a better agreement with the experimental observations than the
standard quark model classification. It is argued that the total energy of
quark components should be proportional to the hadron mass squared rather than
the linear mass. As a byproduct a certain relation expressing the constituent
quark mass via the gluon and quark condensate is put forward. We show that our
approach leads to an effective mass counting scheme for meson spectrum and
results in the linear Regge and radial Regge trajectories by construction. An
experimental observation of these trajectories might thus serve as an evidence

and radioactive process, and multiple Coulomb scattering leading to energy loss
and trajectory deflection, respectively. For a monoenergetic muon beam crossing
an object, the scattering angle follows a Gaussian distribution with a zero
mean value and a variance that depends on the atomic number of the material
object it traversed. Thus, the measured scattering angle may be used to
reconstruct the geometrical and material information of the contents inside the
dry storage cask.
  In traditional X-ray computed tomography, the projection information used to
reconstruct the attenuation map of the imaged objects is the negative natural
logarithm of the transmission rate of the X-rays, which is equal to the linear
summation of the X-ray attenuation coefficients along the incident path.
Similarly, the variance of the muon scattering angle is also the linear
integral of the scattering density of the objects crossed by the muons. Thus, a
muon CT image can be built by equating scattering density with attenuation
coefficient. However, muon CT faces some unique challenges including: 1) long
measurement times due to low cosmic muon flux, 2) insufficiently accurate muon
path models, and 3) the inability to precisely measuring muon momentum.
  In this work, three different muon path models, two different projection
methods, and two different reconstruction methods were investigated for use in
muon CT of dry storage casks. The investigation was conducted in a validated
Geant4 workspace, both in an ideal case and with relevant engineering
restrictions considered. The results of these investigations and the expected
benefits for fuel cask monitoring are reported herein.

source potential and a wave integral in the infinite domain $(0, \infty)$. When
the source point together with a field point is on the free surface, John's
integral and its gradient are not convergent since the integration
$\int^\infty_\kappa$ of the corresponding integrands does not tend to zero in a
uniform manner as $\kappa$ tends to $\infty$. Thus evaluation of the Green
function is not based on direct integration of the wave integral but is
obtained by approximation expansions in earlier investigations. In the present
study, five images of the source with respect to the free surface mirror and
the water bed mirror in relation to the image method are employed to
reformulate the wave integral. Therefore the free surface Green function of the
source is decomposed into the Rankine potential, the five image source
potentials and a new wave integral, of which the integrand is approximated by a
smooth and rapidly decaying function. The gradient of the Green function is
further formulated so that the same integration stability with the wave
integral is demonstrated. The significance of the present research is that the
improved wave integration of the Green function and its gradient becomes
convergent. Therefore evaluation of the Green function is obtained through the
integration of the integrand in a straightforward manner. The application of
the scheme to a floating body or a submerged body motion in regular waves shows
that the approximation is sufficiently accurate to compute linear wave loads in

a representative natural out-distribution set and interpolated in-distribution

black-box adversarial examples without training it on any adversaries. Finally,

Rakich","High-frequency cavity optomechanics using bulk acoustic phonons","10 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To date, micro- and nano-scale optomechanical systems have enabled many
proof-of-principle quantum operations through access to high-frequency (GHz)
phonon modes that are readily cooled to their thermal ground state. However,
minuscule amounts of absorbed light produce excessive heating that can
jeopardize robust ground state operation within such microstructures. In
contrast, we demonstrate an alternative strategy for accessing high-frequency
($13$ GHz) phonons within macroscopic systems (cm-scale). Counterintuitively,
we show that these macroscopic systems, with motional masses that are $>20$
million times larger than those of micro-scale counterparts, offer a
complementary path towards robust quantum operations. Utilizing bulk acoustic
phonons to mediate resonant coupling between two distinct modes of an optical
cavity, we demonstrate the ability to perform beam-splitter and entanglement
operations at MHz rates on an array of phonon modes, opening doors to
applications ranging from quantum memories and microwave-to-optical conversion
to high-power laser oscillators.

experimental measurements of two-dimensional acoustic meta-atoms. In contrast
to extraction from numerical results, this enables all second-order effects and
uncertainties in material properties to be accounted for. We apply the
technique to 3D-printed labyrinthine meta-atoms of a variety of geometries. We
show that the polarizability of structures with shorter acoustic path length
agrees well with numerical results. However, those with longer path lengths
suffer strong additional damping, which we attribute to the strong viscous and
thermal losses in narrow channels.

challenges in the bulk power system operations. A new perspective for measuring
the susceptibility of the system to cascading failures is clearly needed. The
newly developed concept of system stress metrics may be able to provide new
insights into this problem. The method measures stress as susceptibility to
cascading failures by analyzing the network structure and electrical
properties. This paper investigates the effectiveness of transmission switching
in reducing the risk of cascading failures, measured in system stress metrics.
Based on line-outage distribution factors, an algorithm is developed to
identify and test the switching candidates quickly. A case study analyzing
different stress metrics on the IEEE 118-bus test system is presented. The
results show that transmission switching identified by our proposed algorithm
could be used in preventive as well as corrective mechanisms to reduce the
system's susceptibility to cascading failures. Contrary to the conventional
operation wisdom that switching lines out of service jeopardizes reliability,
our results suggest the opposite; system operators can often use transmission
switching, when the system is under stress, as a tool to reduce the risk of
cascading failures.

devastating hazards. Due to the complexity of real chemistry, a single-step
reaction mechanism is usually used for theoretical and numerical studies. The
purpose of this study is to look more deeply into the influence of chemistry on
detonation initiated by a spontaneous wave. Results of high resolution
simulations performed for one-step models are compared with simulations for
detailed chemical models for highly reactive and low reactive mixtures. The
calculated induction times for H2/air and for CH4/air are validated against
experimental measurements for a wide range of temperatures and pressures. It is
found that the requirements in terms of temperature and size of the hot spots,
which produce a spontaneous wave capable to initiate detonation, are
quantitatively and qualitatively different for one-step models compared to the
detailed chemical models. The impact of detailed chemical model is particularly
pronounced for the methane-air mixture. In this case, not only the hot spot
size is much greater than that predicted by a one-step model, but even at
elevated pressure the initiation of detonation by a temperature gradient is
possible only if the temperature outside the gradient is so high, that can
ignite thermal explosion. The obtained results suggest that the one-step models
do not reproduce correctly the transient and ignition processes, so that
interpretation of the simulations performed using a one-step model for
understanding mechanisms of flame acceleration, DDT and the origin of
explosions must be considered with great caution.

producing a high pressure that can be sustained in open areas, the generally
accepted opinion was that the mechanism explaining the high rate of combustion
in dust explosions is deflagration-to-detonation transition. We propose a
theoretical substantiation of an alternative mechanism explaining the origin of
the secondary explosion producing high speeds of combustion and high
overpressures in unconfined dust explosions. We show that the clustering of
dust particles in a turbulent flow ahead of the advancing flame gives rise to a
significant increase of the radiation absorption length. This effect ensures
that clusters of dust particles are exposed to and heated by radiation from hot
combustion products of the primary ignited flame for a sufficiently long time
to become multi-point ignition kernels in a large volume ahead of the advancing
flame.
